<p>In late 2019, we started pre-production of the songs to be released on the new album, <i>More Than Ever, </i>with the goal to hit the studio in February 2020.   In March, everything changed.</p>
<p>Due to the pandemic, our studio sessions were delayed several times and our plans to fund the album ourselves were halted.   Without shows, we thought this project was dead in the water.</p>
<p>Finally, in June 2020, we were able to use personal funds to finish the basic tracking of this new CD at <a href=""https://theblastingroom.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">The Blasting Room Studios</a> in our hometown of Fort Collins, CO.  We hired some of the best in the business, Grammy-nominated producer, Andrew Berlin (<i>Gregory Alan Issacov, Rise Against</i>), and in-house engineer Chris Beeble.</p>
<p>Stretching every dollar we could pull together, we were able to create something we love. But, there is <strong>so much more to do</strong> and we can't finish it without some outside help.</p>
<p>We need to pay for mastering, promotions, merchandise, music videos, pressing CDs/Vinyl, and so much more.</p>
<p>In order to complete <i>More Than Ever</i> , <strong>we are looking to our fans and community for the support to get this album done right.  </strong></p>
<p><strong>Without a doubt, we love how this album sounds already.  </strong>It's truly incredible.  Varying styles &amp; tempos, insightful lyrics, and amazing production work. It is some of the finest music we've recorded to date. </p>
<p>And, we want to get this into the hands of radio stations and promoters who can continue to help us grow as a band, and return to the big stages we love once that is safe to do so.  All of this takes significant financial resources to make it happen.</p>
<p>However, we also wanted to do things a little different than other album crowdfunding campaigns...</p>

<p>Over the last several years, we have written material for at least <strong>three </strong>albums, including the tracks you will hear on <i>More Than Ever</i>.   </p>
<p>So, our goal for this campaign is really pretty simple: <strong>We only want to fundraise once.</strong>  <strong>We want to finish <i>More Than Ever</i> AND record 2 more albums.</strong></p>
<p>Fundraising is new to us, but we are setting our sights high to be able to look forward to the next couple years, the limited options for touring, and the insane amount of music we are writing.  With your help, we can unleash all of this new music to our fans.  Your support will take us to a whole new level of our careers and continue to push us for another 15 years!</p>

<p><i>More Than Ever</i> started out as a love song. As we recorded and listened back to the tune, we knew as a band it would become the name of the album. The term itself took on a life of its own and became a concept we've turned around and asked the community. <br/><br/>In addition to creating music we are passionate about, we want to encourage our community to recognize their own passions during these difficult times. </p>
<p>We gave this challenge to our community and asked them to make their own <i>More Than Ever</i> videos, answering the question, ""What is your 'more than ever'?""  The responses have been amazing.</p>
<p> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1601213183/peemn1hhddywccnyljcj.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;""> </h3>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Who the f*@&amp; is Musketeer Gripweed anyway?</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>The band began from humble beginnings in 2005 when Ben and Jason were neighbors in Fort Collins, Colorado and started casually playing some music together.  Soon after, Gripweed was formed.  Jason's roots in the blues and Ben's wide musical background created an instant bond that led to deep songwriting sessions and their first album release, ""Peace Will Win"".</p>
<p>The name 'Musketeer Gripweed' was taken from a John Lennon reference, specifically his character's name when he acted in the movie ""<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yxy48n7Y9xA"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">How I Won the War</a>"".  And, legend has it that he would use that 'Musketeer Gripweed' pseudonym as an alias when checking into hotels.  The name was strange, but it stuck with fans and friends alike.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1601206711/dehljuymbtagpru3ag8w.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Fast forward to 2008 and Matt Goldberg joined them on keys, bringing a whole new dimension to the music.  Matt brought many layers of sounds to the songwriting with piano, organ, and synths sounds layered over top of the blues.  The music turned towards a more blues-funk sound than ever before.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1601207232/mxl9dmgphpf2mjb5jzaf.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>In 2010, the band recorded their next album, ""Dyin Day"" at Backbone Studios in Loveland, CO.  During these sessions, the band met the incredible Sheryl Renee and her companions in the Black Swan Singers group, which has continued to this day as an amazing friendship and musical bond.   </p>
<p>The album received critical praise not only for the songs, but Jason's lyrical growth touching on subjects of social justice and a need for change.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1601207779/tunt5tusjx2dzivdqjqg.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>In summer 2010, Gripweed needed a sub on drums for some upcoming shows.  Matt and Stu Crair had been playing already together in another project, Dead Floyd, at the time.  Stu sat down at the drum throne with the guys for his first show with the band at NewWestFest and has never looked back, taking over full-time soon after.  Stu's driving beats and deep roots in funk and jazz became infused with the music, and the songwriting began to go a whole new direction.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1601208016/kymvft07cym3d11ytajo.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Around this time, the band's popularity began to explode across Colorado and beyond.  Working with new management, Gripweed toured extensively across the U.S., opening for major acts and playing the festival circuit.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1601208202/huxztvb0v6klmk569cmp.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Over the next few years, the band continued to grow musically with two more full length releases, ""Straight Razor Revival"" and ""Floods and Fires"".  ""Floods and Fires"" was the most intense work the band had done to date, travelling to Los Angeles to work with producer Justin Andres.  Songs like ""End of the Day"" and ""9 LB Hammer"" are sill on regular rotation on Colorado radio stations.</p>
<p><a href=""https://open.spotify.com/album/6XyuLElhgreEGupvBA2YoF"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Listen to ""Floods &amp; Fires"" on Spotify</a></p>

<p> </p>
<p>Packing the house regularly, the band started to find a balance between playing shows on the road and staying home as families grew.   There was always an intense focus on 'family first' with Gripweed, and making sure the band members were able to keep the music alive but their homes lives intact.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1601208324/hisrwofus5p74nwft0es.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>After the departure of longtime guitarist Ehren Crumpler in 2018, Lance Ruby joined the band on guitar.  Bringing a whole new level of musicianship to the band, Lance had an accomplished background with a Masters in Jazz from UNC, but an even more varied resume of performing  with everything from funk to country bands. </p>
<p>With Lance on board, the band began stretching their writing capabilities and the songs gained an edgier rock sound like never before.  The musical growth of a 15 year life span as a band in the new songs is obvious to the Gripweed fan base.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1601208521/sim7qlfoi6didooqkf5q.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Today, you can continue to hear that Gripweed's music is evolving as much as ever. The way in which each member continues to push each other to be better as individual musicians and collectively as a group has led us to the new album, <i>More Than Ever</i>. </p>

This is the first time we have asked our community of family and friends for financial support.
We have always taken a lot of pride in working hard as a band, playing the gigs, and funding our albums ourselves.  That's just not possible right now.In 2020, we're reaching out to you for help through this campaign to record some of our best work yet.
 

 
More Than Ever
 

In late 2019, we started pre-production of the songs to be released on the new album, More Than Ever, with the goal to hit the studio in February 2020.   In March, everything changed.
Due to the pandemic, our studio sessions were delayed several times and our plans to fund the album ourselves were halted.   Without shows, we thought this project was dead in the water.
Finally, in June 2020, we were able to use personal funds to finish the basic tracking of this new CD at The Blasting Room Studios in our hometown of Fort Collins, CO.  We hired some of the best in the business, Grammy-nominated producer, Andrew Berlin (Gregory Alan Issacov, Rise Against), and in-house engineer Chris Beeble.
Stretching every dollar we could pull together, we were able to create something we love. But, there is so much more to do and we can't finish it without some outside help.
We need to pay for mastering, promotions, merchandise, music videos, pressing CDs/Vinyl, and so much more.
In order to complete More Than Ever , we are looking to our fans and community for the support to get this album done right.  
Without a doubt, we love how this album sounds already.  It's truly incredible.  Varying styles & tempos, insightful lyrics, and amazing production work. It is some of the finest music we've recorded to date. 
And, we want to get this into the hands of radio stations and promoters who can continue to help us grow as a band, and return to the big stages we love once that is safe to do so.  All of this takes significant financial resources to make it happen.
However, we also wanted to do things a little different than other album crowdfunding campaigns...
 

 
So Much More Music
 

Over the last several years, we have written material for at least three albums, including the tracks you will hear on More Than Ever.   
So, our goal for this campaign is really pretty simple: We only want to fundraise once.  We want to finish More Than Ever AND record 2 more albums.
Fundraising is new to us, but we are setting our sights high to be able to look forward to the next couple years, the limited options for touring, and the insane amount of music we are writing.  With your help, we can unleash all of this new music to our fans.  Your support will take us to a whole new level of our careers and continue to push us for another 15 years!
 

 
Thank You...Thank You...Thank You
 

We can't say thank you enough to those who can support us to continue to do what we love and create music for you all.  From the way More Than Ever sounds already, we will not disappoint!
Thank you, thank you, thank you to all those that have supported us on this wild 15 year journey and those who continue to do so.   None of this would be possible without your generosity and energy.
With love, more than ever...
Musketeer GripweedJason, Matt, Stu, Lance, and Ben

 


 
What We Need
 
Here is the specific breakdown of what we need to raise through this campaign and how we will use it:

 


 
What Does More Than Ever mean to you?
 

More Than Ever started out as a love song. As we recorded and listened back to the tune, we knew as a band it would become the name of the album. The term itself took on a life of its own and became a concept we've turned around and asked the community. In addition to creating music we are passionate about, we want to encourage our community to recognize their own passions during these difficult times. 
We gave this challenge to our community and asked them to make their own More Than Ever videos, answering the question, ""What is your 'more than ever'?""  The responses have been amazing.
 


 
Who the f*@& is Musketeer Gripweed anyway?
 
The band began from humble beginnings in 2005 when Ben and Jason were neighbors in Fort Collins, Colorado and started casually playing some music together.  Soon after, Gripweed was formed.  Jason's roots in the blues and Ben's wide musical background created an instant bond that led to deep songwriting sessions and their first album release, ""Peace Will Win"".
The name 'Musketeer Gripweed' was taken from a John Lennon reference, specifically his character's name when he acted in the movie ""How I Won the War"".  And, legend has it that he would use that 'Musketeer Gripweed' pseudonym as an alias when checking into hotels.  The name was strange, but it stuck with fans and friends alike.
 

 
Fast forward to 2008 and Matt Goldberg joined them on keys, bringing a whole new dimension to the music.  Matt brought many layers of sounds to the songwriting with piano, organ, and synths sounds layered over top of the blues.  The music turned towards a more blues-funk sound than ever before.
 

 
In 2010, the band recorded their next album, ""Dyin Day"" at Backbone Studios in Loveland, CO.  During these sessions, the band met the incredible Sheryl Renee and her companions in the Black Swan Singers group, which has continued to this day as an amazing friendship and musical bond.   
The album received critical praise not only for the songs, but Jason's lyrical growth touching on subjects of social justice and a need for change.
 

 
In summer 2010, Gripweed needed a sub on drums for some upcoming shows.  Matt and Stu Crair had been playing already together in another project, Dead Floyd, at the time.  Stu sat down at the drum throne with the guys for his first show with the band at NewWestFest and has never looked back, taking over full-time soon after.  Stu's driving beats and deep roots in funk and jazz became infused with the music, and the songwriting began to go a whole new direction.
 

 
Around this time, the band's popularity began to explode across Colorado and beyond.  Working with new management, Gripweed toured extensively across the U.S., opening for major acts and playing the festival circuit.
 

 
Over the next few years, the band continued to grow musically with two more full length releases, ""Straight Razor Revival"" and ""Floods and Fires"".  ""Floods and Fires"" was the most intense work the band had done to date, travelling to Los Angeles to work with producer Justin Andres.  Songs like ""End of the Day"" and ""9 LB Hammer"" are sill on regular rotation on Colorado radio stations.
Listen to ""Floods & Fires"" on Spotify

 
Packing the house regularly, the band started to find a balance between playing shows on the road and staying home as families grew.   There was always an intense focus on 'family first' with Gripweed, and making sure the band members were able to keep the music alive but their homes lives intact.
 

 
After the departure of longtime guitarist Ehren Crumpler in 2018, Lance Ruby joined the band on guitar.  Bringing a whole new level of musicianship to the band, Lance had an accomplished background with a Masters in Jazz from UNC, but an even more varied resume of performing  with everything from funk to country bands. 
With Lance on board, the band began stretching their writing capabilities and the songs gained an edgier rock sound like never before.  The musical growth of a 15 year life span as a band in the new songs is obvious to the Gripweed fan base.
 

 
Today, you can continue to hear that Gripweed's music is evolving as much as ever. The way in which each member continues to push each other to be better as individual musicians and collectively as a group has led us to the new album, More Than Ever. 
For those that have been with us for this entire ride, we know that you will love what you hear. 
For anyone new to Gripweed, we think this is our best work yet and we are so excited to share it with you.
While shows have mostly halted for 2020, we know that we will back to a busy gigging schedule once allowed and continuing  another 15 years of music for you.  Thank you all for your continued support of the band, and our passion to constantly bring you new music.  We could not do this without you.

<h2>
<strong>Hi</strong>,</h2>
<p>my name is Philipp and I am a world citizen born and raised in Germany to a German mother and a Serbian-Bosnian father. I have lived, studied and worked abroad in Turkey, Palestine and Egypt and traveled most of Europe and the Middle East. As a result, my art and personality are profoundly shaped by these diverse influences.</p>
<p>So far I have written and compose poems and songs in four languages: German, English, Turkish and Arabic. Playing the guitar as well as Turkish Saz and Ney (Oriental Flute) I, both willingly and subconsciously blended different styles of music, poetry and emotion, resulting in what I feel is a new and original, still authentic expression of handmade Folk-Music.</p>
<p>Feeling a constantly growing connection to the tradition of traveling musicians and bards or ‘aşık’, the ""loving one"", in Turkish I dedicated myself more and more to substantial music and topics such as love, fear, (self-chosen) exile and hope, to express innermost feelings with the utmost honesty and empathy. While sharing some of my musical and poetic work with dear friends who had experienced prolonged physical and/or emotional hardship, I was blessed enough to find out that it moved them just as much as me, expressing feelings that had never been released or revealed before. To be able to not only help or even heal yourself but others with your art as well, is one of the greatest gifts and feelings ever and I am deeply grateful for it.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need 3000 $ to produce and record 9-10 songs for the Demo CD in a professional studio. Another 1000 $ are estimated for necessary travel and borrowing musical and technical equipment where needed.</p>
<p>Every supporter who donates 30 $ or more will receive a CD with my demo songs, 3 in English, 3 in Turkish, 3 in German, 1 Surprise Song, with a booklet including the English translation of all lyrics.</p>
<p>If I don’t reach the entire funding goal, I will use the collected funds to still record as many songs as possible, either 2 songs for each language or 3 songs in English and Turkish each to start my search for a record label.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>What I can offer is honest, substantial music for which I sometimes put my heart and soul on the line to find ways and expressions that truly connect to other people’s feelings and realities. I believe I can translate – literally, musically and emotionally – between the so called East and West to help people understand each other and to make them feel understood. Your support helps me on this way and my next major step towards this goal.</p>
<p>This is my first major music recording project, but it is by far not my first intercultural project bridging difficult cultural gaps. With a previous crowdfunding project on startnext I realized a year-long music workshop project with teenagers from different religious and social backgrounds in Bethlehem, Palestine. In Germany I have coached young refugees from the Balkans, Turkey and Syria on their way to form a band from scratch, guiding them from their first encounter with a musical instrument until their final performances live on stage in front of an audience. In addition, I am the first foreign student to ever successfully complete and, despite the difficult circumstances, pull through a post-graduate program (including a year at the national conservatory of music) in the West Bank, Palestine.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>When I succeed to find a record label supporting me, my plan is to create an album that tells my story(ies) in four different languages and musical traditions to merge them into something completely new. This has rarely done before, especially by a single person and as far as the Arabic and Turkish Singer-Songwriter Traditions are concerned, I might as well be the first person coming from a different background and country to write and play self-written Folk-Music and Poetry in their respective languages and style.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>This creates not only musical and lingual challenges, but also numerous logistic and practical difficulties, such as traveling to remote places to purchase appropriate instruments or rare books and poetry as well as immersing myself in different cultures and world views. Besides these environmental issues there are more specific challenges like me recording oriental instruments for the first time in a professional studio or singing again after a very long break, still re-discovering my singing voice. I am confident though to solve these problems, since this is not my first experience with a intercultural music project as I have mentioned above.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>This current project is a development in progress, but I am happy and grateful about the process so far which is why I want to start sharing my journey with you. Knowing that there is still a lot of room for improvement, I am always open to new ideas and very much welcome your feedback.</p>
<p>Even if you cannot donate at the moment for whatever reasons, you support is still very valuable and you can spread the word and share my project with others.</p>
<p>Thank you very much for your interest and your support,</p>
<p>with love,</p>

One evening they showed an old record to me with songs by Nikolaj Medtner - a name I had never heard before - , I was a youngster. I fell immediately in love with this beautiful, intense and intellectual music. So I started to study the first sonata. Step by step I had learned and performed all of his sonatas and smaller pieces for violin and piano putting my bloody heart into it. As a curious person I always wanted to know more about Medtner´s personal background next to analysis of the music to answer why it took me in such a trance. And to say a little pre-answer: </p><p>It is indirectly connected to spirituality and ""musical yoga"".</p><p><strong>Nikolai Karlovitch Medtner</strong> was born in 1880 into a Russian family of German descent, the mother was a singer, the father had worked his way up to the director of a Moscow textile factory and enabled his children to receive an upper-class, profound humanistic education. The youngest son soon became one of the best piano students at the Moscow Conservatory. At the same time he studied composition privately with Sergei Taneyev. A deep friendship connected him with his fellow student Sergei Rachmaninoff bet that character was characterized by his radical openness to musical questions, which made life difficult for him. On some musical trips, musically, he despised his contemporaries those who, from his point of view, violated the sacred rules of music theory and who tried to enforce their musical language successfully and individually, among others C. Debussy, R. Strauss and I. Strawinsky. He published his musical views in the book ""The Muse and The Mode"". To him, Bach and Beethoven were considered the absolute masters of the form. ""No other composer has mastered the sonata form with such perfection as Medtner"", notes Alexander Goldenweiser. In insider circles Medtner is regarded as romantic Russian Bach. With his oldest brother Emil, a philosopher, lawyer and closest friend of his youngest brother they experienced a complicated relationship with violinist and singer Anna Markgraf who was first engaged to Nicolai but then married Emil. After two years this marriage was divorced, Anna married Nikolai idolising him their whole life. In 1909 - aged 29 years - Medtner became a professor of piano at the Moscow Conservatory. He declined an offer for a professorship in New York as he was afraid of too many travels,  institutional business and the loss of time that arose from teaching. He preferred a life for composing in peace. The Medtners left Russia in 1921 as opponents of the October Revolution and after disappointing attempts to settle in Berlin, Paris and Florenz finally chose London as their final destination.  </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1609277754/kbdxd81oo72t4wsi7ugw.png"" src=""""/></p><p>Nikolai K. Medtner (1880-1951)</p><p>In 1935 Nikolai Medtner converted from Protestantism to Orthodox Christianity as his new home giving spiritual hold. He dedicated his last piece, a piano quintet: to God. Already at an advanced age and bitter in a certain way about the lack of interest in his work one day a special message reached him by Jayachamarajendra Wadiyar, South India: His Majesty, The last Maharajah of Mysore, himself amateur pianist, was overwhelmed by Medtner´s fairy tales in Berlin lying on the piano of his sister who was studying piano at the University of Arts in Berlin. The young Maharaja was so enthusiastic about Medtner´s music that he swore himself to support Nikolai Medtner as his young patron. From this point of time, in 1946, already older than 60 years  - supported by a noble man half of his age - the composer could fulfil his dream: to record his works and to compose without stress until the end of his life in 1951. As a big MERCI Medtner dedicated his third piano concerto to the Maharaja.  </p><p><a href=""https://interlude.hk/maharaja-music/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://interlude.hk/maharaja-music</a>/</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1609277811/uypsblrzdigtdunmeqcv.png"" src=""""/></p><p>Jayachamarajendra Wadiyar, Maharaja of Mysore, South India, the young patron of Medtner</p><p> </p><p><strong>About Nikolai Medtner´s 2 violin sonatas </strong></p><p>The <strong>violin sonata number 1 Opus 21 in B minor</strong> 1910/11 pays homage to the Greek god of wine Dionysus as God's spiritual and physical intoxication.

It received its inspiration through a report at ARTE-TV where Prof. Peter Proksch, a friend of mine from Düsseldorf University tells about the potential of sponges in the sea, especially the „Golden Sponge“: Its biochemical metabolisms and toxins can be analysed and synthetically produced as medicine as well as varnish in the ship industry as long it is ecologically compatible. The „Golden Sponge“ is often surrounded by sea horses. „Tylodina perversa“, or the „Golden Sponge Snail“, profites from the Golden Sponge through mimesis. The Golden Sponge lives alone or in colonies. Taken from water into the air it immediately shapes to blueblack colour. The piece shows the metamorphosis of this unseen animal to an important supplement for human beings. It is dedicated to Prof. Jürgen Claus - with Nora and their friends Prof. Dr. Lothar &amp; Korinna Prox as well as sheng specialist Wu Wei. Jürgen Claus was a friend of Paik Nam June and made video diving installations underwater. The music is composed for haegum, piri, Chinese saengwhang (mouth organ), violin and specials. It bridges Seoul and Düsseldorf in the 21st century: „Fluxus“ is „Flouxus“ with the magic musical power of the vowel „o“.</p><p>On a meta level ""Golden Sponge"" is an apokalyptic piece about the world which was destroyed from the Western civilisations and the need to expand - in an aggressive way. This music is an indirect desperate attempt to live. The sponge is an allrounder - having lived since ten thousands of years - with a minimum of energy. Humans want to detect everything, driven by their curiosity and greed for more. In the end nature will take revenge - and it has already taken place. Now I write - thanks to Corona - from 2020 nature could recover a bit - if we assume that sustainable energies might really heal the damage . We know that the only changeable thing is our own behaviour. And it also is an homage to the violin and acoustic musical instruments  - which don't need a wire - nearly an animistic point of view next to the Eurocentric way of thinking. A Tsunami cools humans down - as a Thunbergesque prophetic musical expression.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1609278319/a1vwcbzrjnhofumtefxa.png"" src=""""/> </p><p>The Golden Sponge metamorphises to a Golden Star - nature is manipulated by human beings -tender fragile music becomes a funky hip-hop pattern </p><p> </p><p><strong>""A violinist, composer, play director and living orchestra in one person - on the highest level"" (Ivry Gitlis)</strong></p><p> </p><p><strong>Thanks to wonderful colleagues and people this project could happen!</strong></p><p><strong> piano                                    Oleg Polianksy   </strong></p><p><strong>                                              <a href=""http://www.oleg-poliansky.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.oleg-poliansky.com</a></strong></p><p><strong>haegeum                              Lee Seunghee</strong></p><p><strong>saengwhang                        Yoo Hyo-Young</strong></p><p><strong>violin/composition/</strong></p><p><strong>artistic director                  Viktoria  </strong></p><p><strong>                                               <a href=""http://viktoriakaunzner.com/ukorevv_about_en.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://viktoriakaunzner.com/ukorevv_about_en.html</a>                        </strong></p><p><strong>sound production              Michael Fine &amp;

Many concerts were cancelled on very short terms, such as an important orchestra concert at the famous Lotte Concert Hall Seoul with the plan to be broadcasted by Korean TV. Viktoria´s newly arranged piece ""Lucid Dreams"" was part of the program. Lotte Concert Hall Seoul Because of this disastrous Corona year many freelance musicians used the time for recording sessions and video shootings - isolated from audiences and beloved friends. It is a time when humans tend to accept a dimension of ""audio-visual autism"". This can last for a while but cannot replace any analogue activity or fundamentally change our behavior. Still, Germany seems to keep an exception worldwide and some of our friends perform again in South Korea - as normality.  https://www.bz-berlin.de/leute/geiger-daniel-ho...Ten years ago - in 2010 - I had been selected at the age of  28 years as the youngest Western professor of violin in the history of South Korea for the former branch of Music University Franz Liszt Weimar - the German School of Music - at Kangnam University, and stayed for 7 years. I regard this as an enormous gift to my life, having spent such a long time in this energetic country in East Asia - ""A nation of winners"" (The Strad London) and having studied the Korean language, too. During these 7 years I have been through phases of heavy jet lag, and I realized that my energy level became weaker - also influenced by many stimuli from a mega city such as Seoul. I realized to be a more sensitive person than one would expect, and started to compose more than ever in my new home and exile at the same time. Additionally I started to focus and withdrew from all outer influences and voluntarily became an frequent guest - next to concert stage - in the recording studio - with only one goal: getting out the best from music and each specific atmosphere, alone or with others: forever. During this years also MERS hit South Korea, and additional silence was imposed for a couple of weeks.  All in all I fell in love with South Korea and especially its traditional fascinating music - GUGAK. I´d like to share this fantastic cosmos of sounds and interesting Korean instruments with the audiences in Europe.This was the beginning of a long story around NIKOLAI MEDTNER and UKOREVV - Universal Korean Organic Ensemble - Viktoria & Virtuosi e. V.   ""American Record Guide benchmarks Viktoria´s third recording among the top 3: “Like many composers who also make music as interpreters, she has a deeper insight into music than others. Even Ysaÿe's own contrasting reverie, impulsiveness and explosiveness can be heard in her interpretation."" (about ""Les Furies"", Hänssler Classic)I would like to introduce you to my fourth CD recording: the debut recording of UKOREVV Universal Organic Korean Ensemble  - Viktoria & Virtuosi e.V.: It includes fantastic romantic music by Russian composer Nikolai Medtner (1880-1951) as well as my own composition ""Golden Sponge"". This project is an homage to Medtner´s birthday on January 5th and also in 2021 to his 70th year of death. Rachmaninow said Medtner was the greatest composer of their time. I am also very happy to launch my international EurAsian ensemble UKOREVV e.V., a non-profit organization which has its main profile in the fusion of Western and East Asian music - next to excellent evergreens of the the standard repertory. This CD was recorded to be reference No 1 worldwide on the Ex-Midori/ David Guarneri del Gesù violin thanks to Florian Leonhard Fine Violins London - a super violin, fitting to my hands and character. Might I tell a little anecdote around this violin: Practicing on this instrument on the second floor - my mom furiously entered the room and asked me what I had done - my response was: ""just practicing"" - On the first floor in the house a painting had fallen from the wall  - because of this little magic powerful instrument and its long G string vibes... ;-) Thanks to UKOREVV e. V. we can contribute with this musical jewel to the musical scene - despite Corona.  For the finish line of this project - delivering Medtner's unique and rarely performed music to a wider audience - we kindly ask for your help! .Discover more about the story behind this project & enjoy !! ""A violinist with a questing mind - beautiful her compositions"" (The Strad London) Recordings of Medtner´s sonatas at Beethoven Hall Hannover with Oleg Poliansky (piano), page turner Teresa Skade (former Odipo) & Viktoria Once upon a time,In 2005, I was in Paris studying at the Conservatoire National Supérieur de Musique et de Danse staying at my dear cinematographic host family during my Erasmus semester, Marc & Olivier Sandberg and Dina Sofer, a painter and psychologist. One evening they showed an old record to me with songs by Nikolaj Medtner - a name I had never heard before - , I was a youngster. I fell immediately in love with this beautiful, intense and intellectual music. So I started to study the first sonata. Step by step I had learned and performed all of his sonatas and smaller pieces for violin and piano putting my bloody heart into it. As a curious person I always wanted to know more about Medtner´s personal background next to analysis of the music to answer why it took me in such a trance. And to say a little pre-answer: It is indirectly connected to spirituality and ""musical yoga"".Nikolai Karlovitch Medtner was born in 1880 into a Russian family of German descent, the mother was a singer, the father had worked his way up to the director of a Moscow textile factory and enabled his children to receive an upper-class, profound humanistic education. The youngest son soon became one of the best piano students at the Moscow Conservatory. At the same time he studied composition privately with Sergei Taneyev. A deep friendship connected him with his fellow student Sergei Rachmaninoff bet that character was characterized by his radical openness to musical questions, which made life difficult for him. On some musical trips, musically, he despised his contemporaries those who, from his point of view, violated the sacred rules of music theory and who tried to enforce their musical language successfully and individually, among others C. Debussy, R. Strauss and I. Strawinsky. He published his musical views in the book ""The Muse and The Mode"". To him, Bach and Beethoven were considered the absolute masters of the form. ""No other composer has mastered the sonata form with such perfection as Medtner"", notes Alexander Goldenweiser. In insider circles Medtner is regarded as romantic Russian Bach. With his oldest brother Emil, a philosopher, lawyer and closest friend of his youngest brother they experienced a complicated relationship with violinist and singer Anna Markgraf who was first engaged to Nicolai but then married Emil. After two years this marriage was divorced, Anna married Nikolai idolising him their whole life. In 1909 - aged 29 years - Medtner became a professor of piano at the Moscow Conservatory. He declined an offer for a professorship in New York as he was afraid of too many travels,  institutional business and the loss of time that arose from teaching. He preferred a life for composing in peace. The Medtners left Russia in 1921 as opponents of the October Revolution and after disappointing attempts to settle in Berlin, Paris and Florenz finally chose London as their final destination.  Nikolai K. Medtner (1880-1951)In 1935 Nikolai Medtner converted from Protestantism to Orthodox Christianity as his new home giving spiritual hold. He dedicated his last piece, a piano quintet: to God. Already at an advanced age and bitter in a certain way about the lack of interest in his work one day a special message reached him by Jayachamarajendra Wadiyar, South India: His Majesty, The last Maharajah of Mysore, himself amateur pianist, was overwhelmed by Medtner´s fairy tales in Berlin lying on the piano of his sister who was studying piano at the University of Arts in Berlin. The young Maharaja was so enthusiastic about Medtner´s music that he swore himself to support Nikolai Medtner as his young patron. From this point of time, in 1946, already older than 60 years  - supported by a noble man half of his age - the composer could fulfil his dream: to record his works and to compose without stress until the end of his life in 1951. As a big MERCI Medtner dedicated his third piano concerto to the Maharaja.  https://interlude.hk/maharaja-music/Jayachamarajendra Wadiyar, Maharaja of Mysore, South India, the young patron of Medtner About Nikolai Medtner´s 2 violin sonatas The violin sonata number 1 Opus 21 in B minor 1910/11 pays homage to the Greek god of wine Dionysus as God's spiritual and physical intoxication. Dionysus was honored in ecstatic chants and dances which is reflected in movements like ""canzona - danza and ditirambo"" - an alternating song which ionizes stormy rapturous songs of praise between the choir and cantor of the Dionysia. A stormy sequence on the 3rd mouvement leading into a mesmerising melodic ""placido"" In the so-called Spring Sonata No. 2 Opus 44 in G major 1927, Medtner describes the poem  ""Sturzbach im Frühling"" (""spring waters"") written by Fyodor Tyutchev which also inspired Rachmaninov in one of his famous songs.This theme occurs in the final mouvement. The first mouvement is led by the motif of the muses in a tender magical side theme. The middle set of the set of variations has echoes of orthodox church music, especially in two cadenzas of the violin. The variations exude a distinctive dance-like rhythmic evolution mode and reminiscent of balalaika sounds. ""This piece has everyone who got to know it enthusiastically and amazed, of course, nobody writes such pieces anymore nor could they write."" (excerpt from a letter from violinist Alexander Medtner to his brother Nikolai, Moscow January 3, 1927) a Golden Sponge - (Aplysina Aerophoba) „Golden Sponge“ – Aplysina aerophoba – „Goldschwamm“ is an underwater music about a mysterious animal without brain and bones – a sponge. Its live span covers 800-10.000 years. It received its inspiration through a report at ARTE-TV where Prof. Peter Proksch, a friend of mine from Düsseldorf University tells about the potential of sponges in the sea, especially the „Golden Sponge“: Its biochemical metabolisms and toxins can be analysed and synthetically produced as medicine as well as varnish in the ship industry as long it is ecologically compatible. The „Golden Sponge“ is often surrounded by sea horses. „Tylodina perversa“, or the „Golden Sponge Snail“, profites from the Golden Sponge through mimesis. The Golden Sponge lives alone or in colonies. Taken from water into the air it immediately shapes to blueblack colour. The piece shows the metamorphosis of this unseen animal to an important supplement for human beings. It is dedicated to Prof. Jürgen Claus - with Nora and their friends Prof. Dr. Lothar & Korinna Prox as well as sheng specialist Wu Wei. Jürgen Claus was a friend of Paik Nam June and made video diving installations underwater. The music is composed for haegum, piri, Chinese saengwhang (mouth organ), violin and specials. It bridges Seoul and Düsseldorf in the 21st century: „Fluxus“ is „Flouxus“ with the magic musical power of the vowel „o“.On a meta level ""Golden Sponge"" is an apokalyptic piece about the world which was destroyed from the Western civilisations and the need to expand - in an aggressive way. This music is an indirect desperate attempt to live. The sponge is an allrounder - having lived since ten thousands of years - with a minimum of energy. Humans want to detect everything, driven by their curiosity and greed for more. In the end nature will take revenge - and it has already taken place. Now I write - thanks to Corona - from 2020 nature could recover a bit - if we assume that sustainable energies might really heal the damage . We know that the only changeable thing is our own behaviour. And it also is an homage to the violin and acoustic musical instruments  - which don't need a wire - nearly an animistic point of view next to the Eurocentric way of thinking. A Tsunami cools humans down - as a Thunbergesque prophetic musical expression. The Golden Sponge metamorphises to a Golden Star - nature is manipulated by human beings -tender fragile music becomes a funky hip-hop pattern  ""A violinist, composer, play director and living orchestra in one person - on the highest level"" (Ivry Gitlis) Thanks to wonderful colleagues and people this project could happen! piano                                    Oleg Polianksy                                                 http://www.oleg-poliansky.comhaegeum                              Lee Seungheesaengwhang                        Yoo Hyo-Youngviolin/composition/artistic director                  Viktoria                                                 http://viktoriakaunzner.com/ukorevv_about_en.html                        sound production              Michael Fine & assistant                                                http://www.finesoundproductions.com/                                               Sunghag Jung & assistantsound engineer                   Wolf-Dieter Karwatkysound edit                            Clémence Fabrefilm team/ edit                   Louis Vignat   http://louisvignat.com/film/                                                Alexis Delanoue                                               Jonas Niemann                                               Mr Sung studio rental                        Beethoven Hall, Hannover                                               Yulhouse, Seoulviolin mentoring                  Florian Leonhard Fine Violins London                                                https://www.florianleonhard.comgrande piano  service         Piano Finkenstein http://fluegelfink.depage turners                        Teresa Skade (Odipo), Dr. Stephan Schönlaumusic edit                             Dennis Schwachhofer organisation                         German School of Music (Weimar), Kangnam University                                                            Victory Academy Berlin for musical excellence                                                Universal Korean Organic Ensemble - Viktoria & Virtuosi e.V.Florian Leonhard gives the Ex-Midori/ David Guarneri del Gesù violin (1735) to Viktoria Past concerts with this programme (selection) Seoul                        Kumho Art Hall                                  Sejong Arts Center (opening gala Medtner Society Korea                                   & Haeshin Shin)                                  Mullae Arts Center (world premiere of Golden Sponge, 2017)                                  German School SeoulBerlin                       University of the Arts (invited by Dr. Wendelin Bitzan, with PhD                                  Alexander Karpeyev, piano)                                  Atelier Andreas Kägi, violin maker                                  Pianosalon Christofori                                  Zion´s Church                                  Space Godo - Cultural Department of the Embassy of South KoreaMünchen                 Steinway-HausParis                         Studio La VerrièrePrague                     AtriumKöln                          Pianohaus Schoke                                  Musikschule PianoforteLinz                           University of MusicPilsen                       Conservatory of MusicPotsdam                  Palais LichtenauRegensburg             festival hall, OberpfalzDeggendorf             KapuzinerstadlBad Wörishofen      monasteryViechtach                 Pfarrsaal                                   City HallWalderbach             Baroque hall, monasteryAt several concerts I made a questionnaire about Medtner´s music: Oleg Poliansky is prize winner of many international competitions, first of all of the international Tchaikovsky Competition in Moscow` (Russia) in 1998.

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Hi, we're Only Echoes Remain, a 4-piece instrumental progressive post-whatever band based in London, UK, and we're trying to raise some money to help us record our second album.</p>
<p>We released our debut album The Exigent in the Summer of 2017 to great reviews, and since then have enjoyed touring around the UK, played festivals such as Portals, Behave and the veritable ArcTanGent, done shows with some amazing bands, and earlier this year released a live EP recorded from our set at ATG. </p>
<p>Along the way we've never stopped writing, and now we're almost ready to head into the studio and put some new songs down. Unfortunately recording and publishing music is extremely expensive though, and with us being still very DIY and with family lives to keep up, in order to make a record of the quality we'd like (and think you all deserve) we need to ask for your help.</p>

I am a folk singer and a songwriter, born in Ohlone territory, known as the Bay Area, Oakland, California. </p><p>For me, folk music is about the experiences of people and their lives, struggles, legacies, and dreams for a better future, a better now.

It’s ability to narrate so much of our experience here and beyond through infinite styles and across the ages. From instrumentation to lyrical poignancy, from ambient sounds to prayer; it is a connector, a translator of complex realities. A creator of new ways of being, feeling and seeing. </p><p>I believe in folk music's ability to create movements and creative platforms, to be utilized to connect people to each other. To connect us to what is going on in the world, and to make spaces for how people feel. </p><p>With the recording of this album, I look forward to having a tangible offering to create more opportunity for this type of connection, collaboration, and amplification of healing and restorative work for this planet and it’s people. </p><p> </p><h2><strong>Waiting For The Light To Change</strong></h2><p>This album is a collection of 12 songs written over a 15 year period, from my late teens to my early 30’s. The songs for this debut album are written, complete, and ready to fly. Some have gotten very dusty waiting for the confidence in myself and the funds to record, to come together and make this music finally shareable. </p><p>These songs are for those who have loved them over the years, and for those who have yet to hear them. They are for all generations, hurt and healing hearts; for the wanderer, the mystic, the asleep and the awakening, the down and out, the up and rising. They’re for you.

<p>Make Flesh Roxon great again! - Let's do the impossible, together!</p>
<p>This is Flesh Roxon's funding campaign to help the band's brilliant continuation</p>
<p>What do we need and what do you get?</p>
<p>The overall goal of the funding campaign is to raise 25,000, which would go to the band without any intermediaries. We plan to use all the funds for a European tour launching in February 2020. Also, we will use the funds to make a new album and music video.</p>
<p>Through the financial campaign, we offer a variety of packages, including unique ""One of a Kind"" packages, from unique to various numbered Flesh Roxon products.</p>
<p>Why do we need your help?</p>
<p>The upcoming tour will allow Flesh Roxon to continue its story. The music business is difficult and requires money. Unfortunately, we don't have a big organization or a major record company in the background, but we have a very dedicated and big fan base. So, dear fans, we need your support more than ever to bring Roxon's message to the rest of Europe, to do more gigs and bring you new music.</p>
<p>Challenges<br/>The campaign also poses challenges for us. Of course, we do not take it for granted that the campaign is filled with a click of your fingers.</p>
<p>We need the 500 most dedicated fans, friends, family members who can and want to fund the campaign for € 50.</p>
<p>How else can I help Flesh Roxon?<br/> <br/>We hope you share the campaign on your own social media platforms<br/>Also, remember to use Indiegogo's own split URL</p>
<h3>Make Flesh Roxon Great Again</h3>
<p>Make Flesh Roxon great again! - Tehdään mahdottomasta mahdollista, yhdessä!</p>
<p>Tämä on Flesh Roxonin rahoituskampanja, jolla mahdollistat yhtyeen loistokkaan jatkon</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Mitä me tarvitsemme ja mitä sinä saat?</h3>
<p>Rahoituskampanjan kokonaistavoitteena on kerätä 25 000 euroa, joka kulkeutuisi ilman välikäsiä bändin käyttöön. Aiomme käyttää tulevat tulot euroopan kiertueeseen joka starttaa helmikuussa 2020. Lisäksi käytämme varoja uuden levyn ja musiikkivideon tekoon.<br/><br/>Tarjoamme rahoituskampanjan kautta erilaisia paketteja, jotka sisältävät uniikkeja ""One of a kind"" -paketteja, yksityiskeikoista erilaisiin numeroituihin Flesh Roxon tuotteisiin.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Miksi tarvitsemme juuri sinun apuasi?</h3>

Make Flesh Roxon great again! - Let's do the impossible, together!
This is Flesh Roxon's funding campaign to help the band's brilliant continuation
What do we need and what do you get?
The overall goal of the funding campaign is to raise 25,000, which would go to the band without any intermediaries. We plan to use all the funds for a European tour launching in February 2020. Also, we will use the funds to make a new album and music video.
Through the financial campaign, we offer a variety of packages, including unique ""One of a Kind"" packages, from unique to various numbered Flesh Roxon products.
Why do we need your help?
The upcoming tour will allow Flesh Roxon to continue its story. The music business is difficult and requires money. Unfortunately, we don't have a big organization or a major record company in the background, but we have a very dedicated and big fan base. So, dear fans, we need your support more than ever to bring Roxon's message to the rest of Europe, to do more gigs and bring you new music.
ChallengesThe campaign also poses challenges for us. Of course, we do not take it for granted that the campaign is filled with a click of your fingers.
We need the 500 most dedicated fans, friends, family members who can and want to fund the campaign for € 50.
How else can I help Flesh Roxon? We hope you share the campaign on your own social media platformsAlso, remember to use Indiegogo's own split URL

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>As mentioned, I have been invited to headline the Punto Space and Felix Vargas Hispanic Heritage Month Concert Event and I am ever so excited to share this moment with my fans and those who have never heard of me. For those who don't know me, my name is Lee Burgos and I am a singer-songwriter. Having been born in the Dominican Republic and growing up in NYC since the age of 4, I have been influenced by the amazing diversity found within this city which is what led me to pursue my career in music. 5 years ago, I quit my full time Director's job in order to focus on my true passion and it has been rewarding thus far. But it is time to take it to the next level. </p>
<p>Having been given this opportunity by Punto Space and Felix Vargas, I will be able to truly showcase my art to a multitude of people and share an experience with them like none other. Not only am I looking to put together an amazing show filled with lighting and amazing staging, but I am looking to raise funds for Latinas &amp; Lideres, a nonprofit organization dedicated to empowering and inspiring girls from under-resourced communities in the Dominican Republic, allowing them to obtain the tools for becoming leaders of tomorrow! This past July, L&amp;L hosted their very first summer camp at La Universidad Autónoma de Santo Domingo with 30 amazing and dynamic young girls from the under-resourced communities of Villa Mella and El Guaricano, through which they offered a series of workshops and provided school and hygiene supplies all with the goal of teaching the girls the necessary skills to become leaders of themselves, their families and their communities.  L&amp;L has already started planning for the next camp which will take place next summer!  Their goal is to return each and every year to continue to offer this much needed support to the young lideres of the Dominican Republic.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<ul>
<li>I need $5,000 to achieve my goal. With this, I will be able to not only fund the show but also give a nice contribution to Latinas &amp; Lideres! </li>
<li>Though I would love to reach my full goal of $5,000, I would still be able to use any funds raised towards the event meanwhile keeping my promise to Latinas &amp; Lideres. </li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<ul>
<li>Aside from contributing to my lifelong dream of being a world renowned artist, you will be contributing to what will be my first ever headlining show of this caliber which will hopefully catch the attention of record execs and influencers alike. </li>
<li>Though this is my first crowdfunding campaign, I am excited to share my material with you all in hopes that you will find it in you to assist me with my dream and this event. </li>
<li>Honestly, I have been lucky enough to secure three weekly residencies in NYC but quite frankly, it is not enough to make ends meet. I hustle hard on a daily basis from working on new material, attending meetings with people who have been kind enough to offer assistance, and preparing new material for my residencies. This would absolutely help me in realizing this dream. </li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<ul>
<li>My biggest challenge at the moment is continuing the momentum of those who have helped along the way. I am thankful to my band mates, friends, and family whom have stuck beside me but I would like to be able to pay them back by funding and putting this show together for them to enjoy. </li>
<li>Being able to host this show will allow me to create content to bring to record execs. Without this, I will most likely be shut down by many and will have to continue knocking on doors until someone thinks I am a viable asset to their label. </li>

<h3>Holler to the Hill</h3>
<p><i>""I will lift up mine eyes unto the hills, from whence cometh my help. My help cometh from the Lord, which made heaven and earth."" ~Psalm 121:1-2</i></p>
<p>I love My People. I grew up in McDowell County, West Virginia, Twin Branch Holler to be specific. I learned a lot from these Appalachian Mountains and even more from the people in them. My Paw Paw was one of my biggest role models. We went to churches all over “The County” and even went to tent revivals together. He loved to read his Bible and spread the gospel of Jesus. Recently, his lungs gave out because of black lung and we had to bury him. This is for Him and all of My People.  ~Sabrina Shrader</p>
<p>""Authentic"" is a word that is used too frequently of artists who trade in roots styles. It's used so often that it has almost lost meaning. Yet I can think of no better word to describe Sabrina Shrader. That and ""passionate."" You haven't met someone more full of Holy Ghost fire than this daughter of the mountains. I first met Sabrina in 2017. I'd seen her story on multiple news outlets and social media and knew she was a kindred spirit. She spoke truth to power and had been a voice for Appalachians in the streets, at national conferences, and in the halls of government. When she told me she was interested in recording an album of original and traditional music, I knew I had to be part of it. She has a voice that is pure mountain soul but more importantly, she has something to say, something about her faith, her family, her ideas about life in this country, and the hills of southern West Virginia that we both call home. I hope you will support her debut album. ~Wolfman Jack, producer, Holler to the Hill</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Why We Need You</h3>
<p>It will come as no surprise that mountain soul music isn't necessarily the most attractive to large record labels and commercial music producers. Voices that not only sound different but speak hard truths can even be threatening to those who are happy with the status quo. That's where you come in.</p>
<p>We have set an initial goal of $5000 for the production of this album. That money will be spent professionally recording, mixing, and mastering the music. It will go toward the first CD pressing. It will help offset travel costs for Sabrina to travel to the studio. And because we believe you don't muzzle the ox while it treads out the grain, it will be used to pay the local musicians who are contributing their considerable talents and time to making the album happen.</p>
<p>We're happy to offer perks at various levels of support, everything from signed CDs to t-shirts to album credits! But know that whatever level you are able to give, we thank you for making this happen.</p>
<p>If we do not reach our goal, we will still use 100% of the funds toward production of the album -- it just will take longer and we'll be forced to cut some corners.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Why This Is Important</h3>
<p>If you believe as we do that widely-available commercial music only represents a small sliver of the music you want to hear, then this project is for you. If you want to support Appalachian artists and musicians, this project is for you. If you love mountain or gospel music, this project is for you. If you think we need more working-class voices in the arts, this project is for you.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Challenges We Face</h3>
<p>This project can't happen without money, and the artists and producers of the album are just regular working people like you with day jobs and families and bills to pay. Your contribution helps us work on the project without going into debt to do so.</p>
<p>But we are using a group of the very finest artists in West Virginia, musicians who have not only played gospel and mountain music, but country, jazz, soul, rock &amp; roll, and even classical. They've performed for audiences big and small on stages locally and across the country. We are confident that the music we are producing will be something you'll want to listen to over and over.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>If You Can't Contribute Financially</h3>
<p>We know not everyone can give. We've got bills just like you and America in 2020 has been financially challenging for most of us. But if you can't give money, please consider sharing our campaign -- not just once, but throughout the duration. Follow us on Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube and encourage others to do so. And if you know someone with deeper pockets, consider asking them!</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hi! Josefin and Samuel here, the founders and inventors of HARPAD. HARPAD is a guitar add on that will make your musical journey more creative and fun. It is a frame that st up to 6 extra strings which you put on your guitar to transform it for a while. We have a background in Engineering Physics, and we were brought up in musical families. This background gives us the perfect conditions for developing HARPAD from an idea to a physical product. It has taken a while for it to go from a thing in our heads to the stage we are at now. In 2013 we had the idea, but it was only after our second child was born that we started to write the patent and to create the first prototype. How fun to see where we started!! To check that out visit Harpadguitar at Instagram :D</p>
<p>After that we developed our first version of HARPD which we have shown and sold at exhibitions and on our website. We are now ready to spread the word about HARPAD around the world so that more musicians and guitarists can experience the magic!<br/> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We now need you to support us in reaching our goal of 300 sold pieces. This will help us reach out in the future and to set a better price than before. We have had to start at a relatively high price for the first batch and we now want to lower the price. That is why we're doing this campaign now and we hope that you will support us in any way!</p>
<p>We have a special price for the first 100 black HARPADs, another price for the next 100 and a third for the last 100. We also have a few examples with a special color, bronze!<br/>If we get more sales, we will still have a great discount. On top of this you can choose your own package with or with a capo.</p>
<p>If we don't reach our goal of 300 pieces, we will do everything we can to deliver the products anyway. For us, it will only mean that we cannot continue in the phase that we are planning to. If we notice that there are some undetected problems, we will give refunds to everyone minus eventual marketing costs. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>If you can help us in any way with our campaign, we are more than thankful because it means that more people can experience the joy and creativity of playing guitar with the HARPAD. We have gotten feedback at exhibitions and from customers that people think it is really cool and many of them want to have a HARPAD for electrical guitars as well. We hope to be able to develop this once we know that we have support from you!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>This is the first time that we invent something, start a business and do everything that comes with it. This means that there might be a risk for us (Josefin and Samuel) and for you who buy the HARPAD. We think that we have prepared us for this campaign by starting to communicate with a lot of different suppliers and shipment companies. One other risk is that if we don’t succeed we will have a problem keeping our patents and other IP, and that would be so sad for us because we want to continue this journey that we have started.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you like HARPAD but maybe don't play or have the money right now, please share our campaign with your friends and others that you think may also like it. This will help us reach out and raise awareness of HARPAD, and it will be much easier for us in the future to reach out and find the right people to help us in our development.</p>

For the last thirty years I have served  as founding publisher of White Cloud Press, a small book publishing company that has focused on world religions, spirituality, ecology, and yoga titles.</p><p>The idea for this book and music project came to me when I first heard Dylan sing “Jokerman,” in 1983.

And I noted to myself that even though Dylan had frequently drawn on biblical themes from the Old and New Testaments, this lyric was straight out of the gnostic world. Gnosticism was an ancient religious tradition and countermovement to early Christianity, popular between the second and fifth centuries. The Gnostics were notorious for their disdain for hierarchy, and religious controls when it came to the spiritual lives of individuals. They didn’t think you could be saved through a sacrament delivered by a priest, but that your highest self is found within you and you have to go there and find it yourself — and when you find your higher Self what you are finding is <i>gnosis</i>, which means “saving knowledge.”</p><p>The Gnostics were not good at organizing themselves because they didn’t believe in organized religion. So they lost the big theological war with the Church, but their ideas permeated throughout culture. Some contemporary Gnostics are people like Carl Jung, Kathleen Raine, Rainer Maria Rilke, Martin Heidegger, Herman Hesse and Bob Dylan’s good friend Allen Ginsberg.</p><p>So now, twenty-five years after hearing “Jokerman,” I am picking up the threads and exploring gnostic themes and motifs in 13 Dylan songs in the book and then performing the songs with my band The Ghosts of Electricity.</p><p><strong>How You Can Help</strong></p><p>No way to get around it: I need your help.

<p>Since its founding in 2010, Coney Island Reggae On The Boardwalk has become one of the highlights of summer in New York City and one of the premier vinyl reggae sound-system events in the world. This FREE community event is inclusive, welcomes to all who attend, and celebrates Jamaica's gift to the world: reggae music. There is no admission charge to Coney Island Reggae on the Boardwalk - it's a free event - so expenses have to be covered by donations and sponsorships.</p>
<p>This season, the series has expanded to include two events in the Bronx, six in total with four at Coney Island, but without the sponsorship that has helped cover expenses in the past.</p>
<p>There is nothing quite like Coney Island Reggae On The Boardwalk, and it wouldn't be possible without the generosity of individuals.</p>
<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<p>Funding goes toward the soundsystem, gas, transportation, parking, basic supplies, and permits.</p>
<p>There is no support from the Brooklyn Arts Council in 2019 and additional events were scheduled prior to notification.</p>
<p>Contributors receive T-shirts, CDs or vinyl records from VP/Greensleeves Records - the more you give, the more you get.</p>

<h3>Who We Are</h3>
<p>We are <strong>Dreaming Madmen</strong>, a Progressive Rock duo based in Lebanon and Austin, Texas, formed by two brothers, Mathew &amp; Christopher. We've been playing music together for 15 years and have both toured in the Middle East and the US as part of countless projects, such as Brick Floyd (our family Pink Floyd tribute band), The Aaron Clift Experiment, Texas Pink Floyd, and more.</p>
<p>In the summer of 2019, we finally decided to begin recording our debut studio album, <strong>Ashes of a Diary</strong>, an album that had been in the works since 2016. Since our successful release concert in Beirut, we have started selling physical CDs in the US, Poland, Netherlands, Germany, the UK, Sweden, France, and of course, Lebanon, as well as hit over 50 thousand streams on digital platforms.</p>
<p>We're proud of the success this album launch has been to both of our careers, and our love for performing and writing music doesn't stop here. We want to create our sophomore album and organize a release tour to support 'Ashes of a Diary' and the upcoming album in the US and Europe.</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>As independent artists, we fund our projects completely on our own. And as you might know, studio hours and recording time can be incredibly and significantly costly. With your help, we can bring this project to life and share it with you all. Our funding goal is $10,000, which will cover studio sessions, CD and merch manufacturing, as well as the many rewards mentioned in our cool perks!</p>
<p>By contributing to our campaign, you'll get some exclusive limited rewards, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Signed CD of the upcoming album weeks before the official release</li>
<li>Signed hand-written lyrics, posters, t-shirts, and more</li>
<li>The opportunity to play on a track of our new record</li>
<li>The opportunity for us to perform on YOUR music project</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to recording a new album, we are planning to hit the road in Texas and tour in Summer 2020, as well as organizing European shows at later dates. However, the cost &amp; logistics of planning these two tours can be quite high. We have been receiving constant requests to perform in countries such as Germany, the Netherlands, the UK, and Poland, and we want to make that dream come true, for our new and dedicated European fans!</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Music has been our lives ever since the ages of 7 &amp; 9, and we don't plan on stopping anytime soon! We always want to take things to the next level, and our upcoming concept album will be even more ambitious in its scope, just as <strong>Ashes of a Diary</strong> was a concept album; a musical and lyrical journey that we really feel connects on a personal level to both us and our listeners. Our live performances are an audiovisual experience, complete with a psychedelic laser and light show! We always strive to put on a theatrical performance to complement our vast cinematic and orchestral sound, to give our fans an unforgettable concert experience!</p>
<p>We've also been fortunate enough to have worked and been supported by our top-tier team. Some of these members include acclaimed studio drummer Ian Geyer (Jelliflow), Andy VanDette (mastering engineer for Porcupine Tree, Deep Purple, Rush), Russell Tanner (chief engineer of Antimatter Studios).</p>

<p>Making records of such magnitude is always a big and challenging step; but we enjoy the rush, excitement, and difficulties that are all part of creating a great record.</p>
<p>We took on our first challenge with <b>Ashes of a Diary</b> by recording a debut album with over 90 tracks on each song, successfully. We plan to raise the bar even higher with this new upcoming album and create a longer and even more majestic record (also including some real orchestra players on some tracks)!</p>

<h3>Hi Everyone!</h3>
<p>I'm Caroline, and thank you for visiting this page! I'm a recent grad of Marymount Manhattan College where I studied musical theatre and started producing shows for my friends and collaborators. Recently I've rediscovered a passion for writing my own music, and spurred on by the lovely artists that participate in my concert series, Siren Songs, I've decided to record it! </p>
<p>I'm currently making a 5 song EP of some of my favorite originals, and I think they've got the potential to be some of your favorites too. With the help of my incredible producer, Corey Kline, we're turning the songs written on my guitar in my bedroom into certified pop bops. </p>
<p>This EP will be a product I use not only to share my work with my friends and family, but also to send to industry pros, so I want it to be the best it can be- and with your help it will! </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What I Need</h3>
<p>Ok, sharks, I'm looking for $5,000 from you to get this EP recorded, mixed, and mastered. In return you'll get to stream it on all of your favorite platforms for FREE for the rest of time. Think of any contribution you make as an homage to the ancient tradition of buying a cassette or CD. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>For about a year I've been producing a charity concert series called Siren Songs. The profits from that go to a wonderful organization called End the Backlog which you can read about <a href=""http://www.endthebacklog.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here</a>. I want to grow this show into something really big, and putting out my own music will increase my credibility with other artists as well as venues. Not only will this help me, but survivors of sexual assault all over the country. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you've gotten this far, THANK YOU AGAIN! You've already helped by investing your time in my story. If you can't contribute financially, but still want to help, you totally can! Make some noise on social media about this campaign, and maybe your random rich uncle will see and want to donate! Either way, I appreciate you :)</p>

The Impact
For about a year I've been producing a charity concert series called Siren Songs. The profits from that go to a wonderful organization called End the Backlog which you can read about here. I want to grow this show into something really big, and putting out my own music will increase my credibility with other artists as well as venues. Not only will this help me, but survivors of sexual assault all over the country. 

Other Ways You Can Help
If you've gotten this far, THANK YOU AGAIN! You've already helped by investing your time in my story. If you can't contribute financially, but still want to help, you totally can! Make some noise on social media about this campaign, and maybe your random rich uncle will see and want to donate! Either way, I appreciate you :)",0.0,0,"4 Campaigns

<br/><p><span>My name is Rebeca Vallejo and I’m a vocalist and composer from Madrid (Spain) with more than 15 years as a professional performer. Over two years ago I became the curator, host and producer of the music series and festival ‘The Flame: Flamenco Infused Jazz’. I’ve always believed that pushing boundaries is the essence of creative evolution (or any kind of evolution, for that matter) and through this music series we have come to create a scene where the lines between jazz, flamenco and world music meet and are blurred, pushing creative collaborations into new forms of musical expression.</span></p>
<p>After two years of great success, the project's magnitude became too large to be maintained (financially and logistically) just by myself, so this project has been forced to reduce its number of concerts and if funding is not met, we will be forced to close our doors in June :( … So we need your support!</p>

<p>NYC and Flamenco have had a love affair dating back a couple of centuries and there are plenty of spaces in the NYC area where one can enjoy the most traditional forms of the genre but there are no places in NY (or in the country) that showcase “what pushes beyond flamenco” and so, we feel we are on a mission to consolidate the lasting quality of this scene and to also be able to bring in the “big names of the genre”.</p>
<p>The followers of our series range from Spanish expats and Flamenco aficionados, to Jazz fans in search for new fusion sounds.

<h3>Why Do I need your help?</h3> <p> </p>
<p><span>During the last two years I have single-handedly taken care of the additional finances necessary to make a monthly series/yearly festival possible (admin and  promotional  costs, mainly) Because I strongly believe that artists deserve to be paid fairly for their performances I always guarantee a fee that is mostly met through ticket sales but, in the instances where that fee is not met, I have been paying this money out of my pocket.</span></p>

We also want to keep the series affordable to all audiences and at the same time ensure our artists are fairly paid. therefore, WITH THE FUNDS WE ARE REQUESTING WE WILL BE ABLE TO  COVER THE COST OF THE SERIES FOR ONE YEAR.</p>

<li><p>Secure the performer’s fees.</p></li>

<p>Hello Music Lovers, we are “Uncle Sid”!<br/><br/>Emerald Green: Vocals Frankie Scars: Guitar</p>
<p>Kirk October: Bass Dale Salive: Drums</p>
<p>Our Story</p>
<p>Uncle Sid is a Hard Rock'n Metal band from Western Canada. We are very passionate about creating good music, touring and playing live! We work very hard on our song writing and we feel honored to play for our fans and we're grateful for the energy we get back from them. Music is a big part of all our lives and with your help we can get the next level of touring Internationally as well as working on helping others in return.</p>
<p>We are here to share with you our passion for music! We are very excited about the completion of our 5th CD, self titled “Uncle Sid”. It is in it's final stages of mixing and mastering as we speak. We are gearing up to tour extensively to promote it's release. After the CD's release in early 2017 we will start with a Western Canadian Tour, followed by a 10 show tour to Japan. It is quite expensive to tour Japan and this is where we need your help. The tour is $15,000, this covers the expenses to Japan, this includes (for the 4 of us) – Flights, Food, Accommodations, Transportation, Band Equipment, Interpreter, Marketing/Promotion for the CD and Tour plus Booking Fees. This tour is so important as we've been told several times this is a very strong market for us. This Tour will build our Japanese Fan base and allow us to tour there in the future. We have been hard at work on what we feel is the most important and well done album of our career up to this point. “Code Blue” is the 1st single from it. Uncle Sid is truly committed to the craft of making music and we also share the same goals concerning touring and musical direction. With your help 2017 will get us to the next level of International touring. We are now at a point where timing is everything and all we need is your help to get us on this very important touring May. With your support, Uncle Sid vows to make and play the best music we can so we can make everyone who helped us be proud of the fact that you where a big part of team that got us there.

<li>Accommodations</li>
<li>Our equipment</li>
<li>Japanese interpreter</li>
<li>Marketing and Promotion of our CD</li>
<li>Booking Fees</li>
</ul>
<p>The Impact</p>
<p>This tour will have a great impact on this Uncle Sid as it will show us another culture and how they react to our music. We've been told Japan will be very good for us if we go there and put on a Rockin show. That's what we intend to do! It will also help us grow our multimedia's such as Facebook, Instagram and Twitter. You will be helping us build our fan base and gain success in this Market.</p>
<p>Risks &amp; Challenges</p>
<p>As I've said this band works very hard on our music and in return all we want is to be able to tour and make a living playing music. This Japanese tour will be the beginning of a long road of making music and touring Internationally. A lot is riding on this particular album and tour. It will determine the longevity of the band for the next several years of our careers. We've booked our own tours in Canada, the market is very small in Canada and there's a lot of miles to cover to play your next show. Japan will give us access to many people with a small amount of traveling with way more people to play for. We feel very strongly that this will be a great Market for us and get us on the road to financial freedom.</p>

Our Story
Uncle Sid is a Hard Rock'n Metal band from Western Canada. We are very passionate about creating good music, touring and playing live! We work very hard on our song writing and we feel honored to play for our fans and we're grateful for the energy we get back from them. Music is a big part of all our lives and with your help we can get the next level of touring Internationally as well as working on helping others in return.
We are here to share with you our passion for music! We are very excited about the completion of our 5th CD, self titled “Uncle Sid”. It is in it's final stages of mixing and mastering as we speak. We are gearing up to tour extensively to promote it's release. After the CD's release in early 2017 we will start with a Western Canadian Tour, followed by a 10 show tour to Japan. It is quite expensive to tour Japan and this is where we need your help. The tour is $15,000, this covers the expenses to Japan, this includes (for the 4 of us) – Flights, Food, Accommodations, Transportation, Band Equipment, Interpreter, Marketing/Promotion for the CD and Tour plus Booking Fees. This tour is so important as we've been told several times this is a very strong market for us. This Tour will build our Japanese Fan base and allow us to tour there in the future. We have been hard at work on what we feel is the most important and well done album of our career up to this point. “Code Blue” is the 1st single from it. Uncle Sid is truly committed to the craft of making music and we also share the same goals concerning touring and musical direction. With your help 2017 will get us to the next level of International touring. We are now at a point where timing is everything and all we need is your help to get us on this very important touring May. With your support, Uncle Sid vows to make and play the best music we can so we can make everyone who helped us be proud of the fact that you where a big part of team that got us there. Please help our campaign by contributing to our cause and you can receive some really awesome gifts.Thank you so much for your help!

<h3>Who Am I?</h3>
<p><strong>My name is Jeff Ruby and I'm singer-songwriter based in Nashville, Tennessee.</strong>  I love to write and perform and will continue to do it as long as I am physically able.  It's been a couple of years since my last album release and I have some new songs I'd like to record and share with you.</p>
<p>This is my first attempt at crowdfunding.  I have no idea or expectation of a future result.  What I can tell you is with your help you will be the lifeblood of this project and help me reach a wider audience.  </p>
</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Cost &amp; Perks</h3>
<p>Studio time, engineers, producers, musicians, and video crews all require financial resources.  I've booked studio time at La La Land in Louisville, Kentucky and will co-write and co-produce this album with an old friend, Ben Felker (The Fervor), from Louisville. </p>
<p>I've put together some perks for those of you who donate to this campaign, which you can view to the right.  Each is a small token of thanks for your support.  </p>
<p><span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'>I'm aware that the financial goal of $7,500 may not be met.  I'll be thankful for every cent received.  If the total goal is not reached, some parts of the project may be scaled back like the music video or marketing the new album.  With this being a flexible goal, all money donated will help fund this project whether or not the total  amount.  The first priority is to get the album recorded, mixed, and mastered.  </span></p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Like I stated earlier, music is what keeps me ticking.  With your support, I'll be able to create a new album, a music video, and tour in support of the new album.  After recording costs are covered, creating a music video and marketing campaign will allow me to reach a wider audience.  </p>

<h3>We are MRVAMPIRE, a gleefully apocalyptic rock band from Venice, California. We enjoy long walks on the beach, late night jams with friends, razor blades and explosions. </h3>
<p>Our patron saints are William Burroughs and Danny Devito, and we've been compared to ""The Doors with Balls"", ""The Cramps on Acid"" and ""The Pixies Meet Billie Holiday"".  </p>
<p><span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'>As we've watched the apocalypse draw closer to our tropical horizon, we've cooked some really interesting songs about our incoming robot overlords, truck-stop romance, the need for a deep breath, and how we learned to relax and love the bomb.</span></p>
<p><strong>David Bowie called music the last surviving form of magic, because it brings about something from nothing.</strong> Well, we've risked life and limb to pick flowers from the void, and we're excited to show them to you.</p>
<p>The bars, living rooms and record stores of LA have seen us hone the hell out of our craft over the last 3 years. <strong>We're ready to make something shiny and new. </strong>With your donations, we'll be summoning the old gods in one of the original Los Angeles recording studios : <strong>4th street recordings in Santa Monica</strong>. Partners Sejo and Kathleen have worked with some of the greats, and they're going to help us take something amazing and elevate it to utter bananas.</p>
<p>In addition, your contributions will allow us to create amazing artwork to complete the circuit, and, more importantly, help us get on the road to share our new tunes live up and down the west coast, from Tijuana to Vancouver.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>We are hoping to raise $10,000. This will break down as follows: </h3>
<p>Recording and Production: <strong>$6,080</strong></p>
<p>Mastering: <strong>$1,200</strong></p>
<p>Cd's, Original Artwork, T-shirts, Hats, Buttons and Stickers for our Donors, plus mailing expenses:</p>
<p><strong>~ $1,800-$2,100</strong>, depending on demand. </p>

</div></div>","We are MRVAMPIRE, a gleefully apocalyptic rock band from Venice, California. We enjoy long walks on the beach, late night jams with friends, razor blades and explosions. 
Our patron saints are William Burroughs and Danny Devito, and we've been compared to ""The Doors with Balls"", ""The Cramps on Acid"" and ""The Pixies Meet Billie Holiday"".  
As we've watched the apocalypse draw closer to our tropical horizon, we've cooked some really interesting songs about our incoming robot overlords, truck-stop romance, the need for a deep breath, and how we learned to relax and love the bomb.
David Bowie called music the last surviving form of magic, because it brings about something from nothing. Well, we've risked life and limb to pick flowers from the void, and we're excited to show them to you.
The bars, living rooms and record stores of LA have seen us hone the hell out of our craft over the last 3 years. We're ready to make something shiny and new. With your donations, we'll be summoning the old gods in one of the original Los Angeles recording studios : 4th street recordings in Santa Monica. Partners Sejo and Kathleen have worked with some of the greats, and they're going to help us take something amazing and elevate it to utter bananas.
In addition, your contributions will allow us to create amazing artwork to complete the circuit, and, more importantly, help us get on the road to share our new tunes live up and down the west coast, from Tijuana to Vancouver.

We are hoping to raise $10,000. This will break down as follows: 
Recording and Production: $6,080
Mastering: $1,200
Cd's, Original Artwork, T-shirts, Hats, Buttons and Stickers for our Donors, plus mailing expenses:
~ $1,800-$2,100, depending on demand. 
Whatever the remainder, after the percentage to IndieGogo, will go to defray the costs of a Best Western Tour from Tijuana to Vancouver. 
Our backers don't just get the EP. There is also a secret backers-only track that we are recording that they will hear a full 6 months in advance of the public. Also, backers will get special editions of the album and backers-only art work. Top donors will get one of 10 signed, hand-painted concept mock-ups of the EP cover, one of which will be selected by our donors to be the official cover. 
That's not all! We will be releasing weekly content to our backers only, with a back door view of the recording process and our creative process. We will also hold live rehearsals and question-and-answer sessions so our fans old and new can let us know how we're doing, chime in, heckle us mercilessly, and order us around. You're making this happen, so we're kind of your gimps. 
In the unfortunate but possible event that we do not meet our full goal,  we will release a series of singles in place of a full EP, and/or attempt to relegate the most delicate aspects of recording (Drums and Vocals) to the full studio, and use a network of friends' home studios to get the rest recorded.

<p>Friends…</p>
<p>My last album, “Dare to be Your Self” was an exploration and revelation of what one path to enlightenment might look like.  That it happened to be <i>my</i> path was not entirely coincidental.</p>
<p>Dare to be Your Self turned out to be a community experiment.  It was funded by a crowd of people who believed in themselves enough to, in turn, believe in me and my work.</p>
<p>This got me thinking.  It’s been proposed that, beneath our apparent differences, we are the same… one heart, one soul, one mind.  Individualized expressions of the same Thing.</p>
<p><strong>This new project has me really excited because it directly addresses this notion. That we, at our core, are one.  Almost every song on the album was written at the request of a minister or speaker from New Vision Center for Spiritual Living in Phoenix.  </strong></p>
<p>Often, I am called upon to write a song that supports the topic that the speaker will be addressing.  I am given a short synopsis that describes in very broad strokes what will be discussed.  Then they turn me loose.</p>
<p>But here’s the thing.  Where do ministers and spiritual speakers get their inspiration?  How do they choose what to say and how to say it? </p>
<p>I think that comes from you, from us, the people they’re talking to.  It is the collective consciousness we create as a community that generates inspiration for them.  Every speaker will tell you that there have been times when they have wound up giving an entirely different talk than the one they had planned. </p>
<p>We ignite something in them.</p>
<p>We inspire the speaker.</p>
<p>The speaker inspires the song.</p>
<p>The song inspires the congregation.</p>
<p>And the cycle continues.</p>
<p>So maybe you can see how thrilling it is to be such a big part of this creative process. A thought inspires an action, resulting in a tangible thing. </p>

I’ve been writing songs since I was about 14 years old - almost 10 years - and as soon as I found that outlet, it sounds cheesy, but it changed my world forever. When I moved to Nashville to study music at Belmont University, I quickly realized that writing, creating and performing my songs as a career wasn’t just a pipe dream. I could really do this.</p>Now, 6 years later, I am ready to release my debut EP, Electric!. It’s an exploration of love, joy, passion, pain, and so much more. I’ve worked with my producer and friend griggs over the past year and a half to craft these songs. Having a constant collaborator has pushed me to be more vulnerable in my writing than I thought I could ever be, helping make these songs some of the most important ones I’ve written.<br/><br/>                                                  ____________________________________<br/> <p>If you can contribute to help fund this record, check out the perks listed on the right that you’ll receive as a thank you for your help and donation!

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p><i>Who is NuBlvckCity?</i></p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>NuBlvckCity</strong> is a Kansas City-based music collective that combines Soul, Hip-Hop, Jazz, and R&amp;B with live looping, an electric performance, and storytelling. Members include (pictured above), Kartez Marcel (Vox, Keys, Sounds); Mae C (Vox); Sauce (vox), and VP3 (Sax). Their promo tour has included Chicago, IL, Omaha and Lincoln, NE, Austin, TX, Lawrence, KS, Atlanta, GA, Tulsa, OK, and more.</li>
<li>This campaign is vital to us and our mission of injecting a new sound and feeling in the music atmosphere.</li>
<li>Being a part of this is being a part of the foundation of greatness. We have all individually gained certain success in our careers but now we are on the verge of something much bigger than us. That's why we need you.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p><i><strong>COSTS ---&gt;</strong></i></p>
<ul><li>We need $5000, or at least close as possible to it. Here's a breakdown of the tour and recording costs for the EP.<ul>
<li>Tour: <strong>Car rental/van rental</strong> (we use Avis and the cost of 15 days worth of rental is somewhere around <strong>$1000</strong>--we will handle the insurance), <strong>car gas </strong>(at current gas prices for regular will be around <strong>$750</strong>), <strong>lodging</strong> (we will usually stay in the most affordable hotels or air bnb's with 1 or 2 room's. This figure was difficult to calculate but we will budget a nightly stay at $75. We will need overnight lodging for at least 9 of the 11 dates, equaling <strong>$675)</strong>.</li>
<li>Recording Costs: <strong>Beats </strong>(we are doing a deal with one of KC's top producer's to get custom beats for our sound. We will also add our Saxophone and other instruments to the overall production. At this time, the deal is <strong>$500</strong> for the EP). <strong>Recording</strong> (average costs for professional quality recording including mixing in Kansas City is around $40 an hour. We figure we can complete an EP, after rough draft recordings, with 10 hours. The full cost will be at least <strong>$400</strong>), <strong>Mastering</strong> (for the EP will be handled by an engineer we have a great relationship and have previously worked with on other projects. For an EP, where ours will contain 3-5 songs, costs will be around <strong>$250</strong>)</li>
<li>Distribution and duplication: <strong>Digital distribution</strong> (we will distribute through a quick and user friendly distributor like CD BABY that has more services to protect us on the back end of royalty collection. Price will be around <strong>$90</strong>), <strong>CD duplication</strong> (as CD's buying is dying, we will start off with about 200. Price will be around <strong>$500</strong> for full packaging and duplication with shipping, etc.</li>
<li>The remaining $<strong>635</strong> will go towards, toll fees, parking fees, any other hidden fees, last minute/extra merch costs, miscellaneous items, on the road food, and most importantly a multi-social media marketing campaign that will promote our tour dates to cities and target areas on our tour route.</li>

<h3><strong>Overview</strong></h3>

The Impact

This is music that could be programmed by adventurous orchestras alongside the iconic works of a Berlioz or a Beethoven.   It is music that is both inspired and influenced by these past masterworks; but, more than that, it seeks to build a new language out of certain overlooked details.  I believe this is what is special about it.  And, with the help of this grant, it will finally have an audience other than its composer.  As recorded media it will be available for broadcast, CD distribution, and Web sharing all over the world!
Risks and Challenges
As with many projects reliant upon funding, there is the risk that the goal of $15,000 will not be reached by the end of the campaign.  That is why flexible funding as been chosen, so that all money collected will still be applied to the project, even if its realization is delayed to 2020.  No part of the funding raised will be used to support any other project.  
Other Ways to Assist
Please remember that even the smallest of donations help.  If it is not possible for you to assist in a monetary way, please make this endeavor known to others through social media and word of mouth.  Listen to other music by the composer by visiting:

<p>Hello Big Band Fans,</p>
<p> </p>
<p>My name is Frank Vardaros and I am a trumpeter and leader of the Frank Vardaros Jazz Orchestra based out of Los Angeles, California.  I have been in the music industry for many years and have performed with many of the greats including Nick Brignola, Clark Terry, Arturo Sandoval, Jon Faddis, Bill Watrous, Slide Hampton, Maynard Ferguson, Nestor Torres, George Garzone, Jerry Bergonzi, Ed Calle, Bobby Shew, Bob Mintzer, Bob McChesney, the Boston Metropolitan Orchestra, I have toured the world and have performed at such prestigious venues including the Boston Globe Jazz Festival, Newport Jazz Festival, Carnegie Hall, Saratoga Springs Jazz Festival, Boston Phoenix Jazz Festival, Scullers Jazz Club, the Regattabar, Ryles Jazz Club, and the Marbella Spain Jazz Series. Now that I reside in Los Angeles, I have been able to put together a world-class big band of some of the finest musicians.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Recording a project of this magnitude with some of the greatest jazz musicians around is quite a costly undertaking.   </p>
<p>We are raising the funds to help:<br/>•Pay the Musicians<br/>•Pay for the Recording Studio, Mixing, Mastering<br/>•Pay the arrangers<br/>•Pay for the Pressing of both the limited edition vinyl as well as the CDs<br/>•Pay for Promotion<br/>•We also would like to bring this music to various, elementary, middle, high school and colleges to help expose these young people to this artform, that more than likely, they will not hear.<br/><br/>We plan to start recording as soon as the fundraising campaign is over and plan to release sometime in September.</p>
<p>Please support in any way that you can, so we can help perpetuate the art of Big Band Jazz.  </p>

<h2>THE RADIANCE New Album and Audiovisual Experience ELEMENTAL – Recorded in a 600 year old temple, with artists from across the globe.</h2>
<p>I am excited to invite you all to take part in a unique experience - an experience that captures a time in Beijing where rare collaborations of this nature are still possible. Recorded in a <a href=""http://www.thetemplehotel.com/templehotel/index.php?lang=en#"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">600 year old Temple</a> in the heart of Beijing, ELEMENTAL will bring together musicians and artists from China, Europe and the US to create an album and audiovisual experience of quiet passions, fragility, strength, elegance and essence.</p>
<p>I have so much gratitude for the opportunity to share this artistic process with you all, and to see our collaboration come together.  From the bottom of my heart, I THANK YOU for believing in me and turning this dream into a reality.  x - <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/miranda_vukasovic/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Miranda</a>, THE RADIANCE </p>

<h3>The music</h3>
<p>Located inside a historical Qing Dynasty temple courtyard, The Radiance will record their new album ELEMENTAL. In a sacred space that  juxtaposes the old and new Beijing, the five elements with be born into the world and reverberate through music. </p>
<p>ELEMENTAL is inspired by the traditional Chinese philosophy of the five fundamental elements - Earth, Metal, Water, Wood and Fire - that underpin our world and between which all interactions occur. As each new element is introduced from the remnants of the last,  the music will culminate in a cornerstone piece “Gold Shaded Moon”, in which all elements are present. The essence of the ancient temple space will become an integral part of the recording; a snapshot of one piece of Beijing and the moment it occupies in time.</p>

<h3>The team</h3>
<p>Featuring both traditional and ethnic minority Chinese instruments, The Radiance will collaborate with an international team including Grammy award-winning producer <a href=""http://www.bovaland.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Jeff Bova</a> (Celine Dion), <a href=""https://en.audiofanzine.com/sound-technique/editorial/articles/super-heavy-sound-made-in-l-a.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Ned Douglas</a> (Stevie Nicks, Mick Jagger) and director/VFX artist, <a href=""https://www.jeffranasinghe.com/bio"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Jeff Ranasinghe</a> (Avengers, AntMan Vs Wasp). </p>
<p>Last year, The Radiance won the AKADEMIA BEST AWARD WINNING SONG 2018 in category best Ambiental/Instrumental Music for their song <a href=""https://open.spotify.com/album/3FjtOWKFO7Nra9GbMwZe8H"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><i>Flying Kites</i></a>.

<p>Beijing’s independent music scene is special, and The Radiance captures this magic through collaboration and music that transcends cultural boundaries - touching all who listen to it on an individual, yet unifying, level.</p>
<h3>Audiovisual Installation</h3>
<p>The centerpiece of the project is an audiovisual installation for the song “Gold Shaded Moon”; a musical work in three movements that delves into the nature of artistic creation. The added visual component will bring a new dimension to the music and allow the piece to be experienced in a different way. </p>
<p>The installation will consist of four screens: north, east, west, and a central screen that metaphorically represents ""the individual"".  A bridge is created between the screens, from self to the collective, internal to external. A shared dream where beauty arises through the power of divergence.</p>
<p>Visually, the ancient and rich details of the temple will be mixed with cutting edge VFX and projection to bring the space to life in new and unexpected ways. Our talented global musicians will be recorded in the temple environment to capture its acoustic details and then mixed with modern synthesis and sampling techniques to create a sonic hybrid. </p>
<p>The result will be both modern and classical. </p>
<p>The work is to be exhibited in museums and galleries where it will invite people to live the music through the space; to be immersed in a performance without a performer but with an intimate relation between sound, space and visuals, dream and reality.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>I am Dianna St. Hilaire a singer that goes by the name Opāru.  Opāru is an electro-pop project from Los Angeles.   The name Opāru is my birthstone Opal in Japanese.  Not to be confused with the Russian version meaning Coldsore.  LOL. </p>
<p>I have been playing music for <strong>over 15 years</strong>.  I write on piano and pre-produce my music using programs like Fruity Loops &amp; Logic.   Over the years I have worked with Kim Fowley <strong>(Joan Jett, The Runaways, Kiss), </strong>Roy Thomas Baker (<strong>Queen</strong>) and J-Swift<b> (The Pharcyde)</b>.   </p>
<p>Opāru was launched in 2016 with the song ""Remember Me"".  It was well received by the press listed in Huffington Post and Hype Machine.   Songs were on the Billboard Music Charts, and I was on the Grammy Ballot 2 years in a row.  </p>

<div>REMEMBER ME LYRIC VIDEO!</div>
<div> </div>
<p>The song ""Ghost To Follow"" was produced by Josh Stevens <strong>(LMFAO, Jennifer Lopez, Pit Bull) </strong>and was recorded at Studio City Sound.</p>
<p>As an artist I've always appreciated introspective music.  It has helped me through some of the hardest times of my life.  Internal struggles can be overbearing and seem impossible to get through sometimes. </p>
<p>Music has always been a way out, an escape from the feelings of pain and suffering.  Almost like an auditory hug.  The difference is it won't judge you later or tell your neighbors or friends about what you're going through.  It is personal and deep. </p>
<p>I know everyone deals with this at some point in their life and for some people like myself, it can be the difference between facing the world and curling up in a ball and dying.  </p>
<p>I wanted to have an opportunity to share this song with the world.    Though it has been released and you can watch the lyric video and listen to the song on Youtube, iTunes, Spotify etc.  I feel it needs a physical presence in the world to give it even more impact.  Something that visually represents the depth of the song.  It tells the story between the internal voice and the external world.  </p>
<p>By contributing, you are not only helping me make a beautiful music video, but you are helping others by allowing them to go deep within themselves and change their own lives.  I believe sometimes it takes that extra visual element to get people to listen.  </p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>This isn't my first music video rodeo.  I've produced quite a few of them already.</p>
<p>Your funding is going into some amazing stuff.  Normally the cost of doing an underwater music video would start out at around 25k.  I luckily have a talented group of videographers and crew that are willing to work on this project for free.  We also have a great camera to use for the shoot already.  We are going to be using the Red Gemini.  </p>
<p>So what we need is money for other equipment rentals and production costs.</p>
<p>Makeup {200}</p>
<p>Cables, Underwater Lighting, Monitors {1000}</p>
<p>Lenses {500}</p>
<p>Animal Masks {200}</p>

<p>I have some really unique perks for this including...  </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Custom T-Shirts</strong></li>
<li><strong>Mix Tapes</strong></li>
<li><strong>A free personal copy of the Music Video</strong></li>
<li><strong>Animal Mask from the video</strong></li>
<li><strong>A day on the set of the video</strong></li>
<li><strong>Come the wrap party.</strong></li>
<li><strong>My entire music catalog including Versailles songs.  </strong></li>
<li><strong>Come have lunch with me.  Ask me anything!</strong></li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>Even if I don't make all the funds I need we will still be launching this music video. It may take more time for me to do it but it will happen regardless.  </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>You may not know this already but music is so important.    Here are some of the benefits of listening to it.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Improves mood.  </strong>Studies show that listening to music can benefit overall well-being, help regulate emotions, and create happiness and relaxation in everyday life.</li>
<li>
<strong>Reduces stress.</strong>  Listening to ‘relaxing’ music has been shown to reduce stress and anxiety in healthy people and in people undergoing medical procedures (e.g., surgery, dental, colonoscopy).</li>
<li>
<strong>Lessens anxiety.</strong> In studies of people with cancer, listening to music combined with standard care reduced anxiety compared to those who received standard care alone.</li>
<li>
<strong>Improves exercise.</strong> Studies suggest that music can enhance aerobic exercise, boost mental and physical stimulation, and increase overall performance.</li>
<li>
<strong>Improves memory</strong>. Research has shown that the repetitive elements of rhythm and melody help our brains form patterns that enhance memory. In a study of stroke survivors, listening to music helped them experience more verbal memory, less confusion, and better-focused attention.</li>
<li>
<strong>Eases pain</strong>. In studies of patients recovering from surgery, those who listened to music before, during, or after surgery had less pain and more overall satisfaction compared with patients who did not listen to music as part of their care.</li>
<li>
<strong>Provides comfort.</strong> Music therapy has also been used to help enhance communication, coping, and expression of feelings such as fear, loneliness, and anger in patients who have a serious illness, and who are in end-of-life care.</li>
<li>
<strong>Improves cognition</strong>. Listening to music can also help people with Alzheimer’s recall seemingly lost memories and even help maintain some mental abilities.</li>
<li>
<strong>Helps children with autism spectrum disorder</strong>. Studies of children with autism spectrum disorder who received music therapy showed improvement in social responses, communication skills, and attention skills.</li>
<li>
<strong>Soothes premature babies. </strong>Live music and lullabies may impact vital signs, improve feeding behaviors and sucking patterns in premature infants, and may increase prolonged periods of quiet–alert states.</li>
</ul>
<p>In my career,  I have done around 15 music videos.   I am a great producer of music videos and I know I can make this work.    My last video <a href=""https://youtu.be/fF1eg88nIcU"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">""Remember Me""</a>  has over 45K views on Youtube and 175K on Facebook.   </p>

<h3>The Project</h3>
<p>Everything is ready to go, and I’ve got ten good songs that I’ve written that could be classified in the Americana genre, influenced by traditional country, blues and rock n’ roll. I have the consultation and guidance of veteran Nashville professionals in the areas of production, promotion and management, as well as the opportunity to record with world class session musicians in Nashville’s legendary <strong>Hilltop Recording Studio</strong>, proven to be one of the area’s best.</p>
<p><strong>BACKGROUND</strong></p>
<p>The story behind this particular recording project actually began many years ago when I was a young guy working in a steel mill in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and went down to Nashville, Tennessee full of enthusiasm, hoping to get a contract with one of the big record companies. However, I was surprised to discover that I couldn’t even get past the door to any of the major labels.</p>
<p>Feeling pretty down, I eventually found a live music venue that was frequented by a lot of the Nashville musicians. That’s where I was fortunate to meet producer <strong>Tom Wilkerson</strong>, who at the time was a studio session drummer, as well as a touring musician with some of the biggest names in the country music scene. Tom gave me a lot of advice about what was happening there in Nashville, and he brought me to<strong> </strong>Hilltop Recording Studio, where we agreed to pull together our resources and record some of my songs.</p>
<p>I went back to Pittsburgh, and as young people often do, I was feeling that there was plenty of time to get that record done, so I set off rolling down that windy road playing gigs everywhere from Austin, Texas to Moscow, Russia, and eventually found myself living and performing most of my years in Finland!</p>
<p style=""text-align: right;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1553459305/xkeupe8tozlojglksf5p.jpg"" src=""""/>Photo: Roosa Kulju</p>
<p>Finland has been good, and my music has brought me to many other wonderful countries to perform, but through the years I’ve always regretted not following up on the opportunities that Tom was offering in Nashville.  So I decided to do something about it, and I contacted him through the internet, asking if it would still be possible to get that record made. I was soon happy to get a positive reply, and he invited me over to Nashville to talk about it.</p>
<p>Well I got over there and we picked up where we left off. We made a plan, and Tom also connected me with some of his professional colleagues in the industry, including influential musician, record promoter <strong>Bill Wence</strong>, and highly accredited session musician <strong>Jerry Kroon</strong>. We decided to put together a top rate team, and get back to Hilltop Recording Studio and produce my solo album.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Action</h3>
<p><strong>FUNDING </strong></p>
<p>With all other areas settled, now it’s time to raise the financing to cover the costs of this project. If the funding can be achieved, hopefully within about six weeks time, it could be possible to begin the recording sessions in June 2019. Expecting an effective creative process, followed by technical production, the target release date accompanied by the promotional campaign launch will be in  Autumn 2019.</p>
<p>The amount needed is approximately $20,000 US Dollars. Here's an estimate in rounded off figures of where the funds will be applied:</p>
<p><strong>SESSION MUSICIAN FEES</strong></p>
<ul><li>10 songs 5 musicians + 1 backing vocalist + arrangements/charts                            $7,000</li></ul>
<p><strong>STUDIO COSTS</strong></p>
<ul><li>All instrumental tracks + vocal tracks + mixing and mastering                                    $4,000</li></ul>
<p><strong>ADMINISTRATIVE + PRODUCTION COSTS</strong></p>
<ul><li>Including travel, hotel, meals, CD manufacturing, shipping costs of rewards, plus consideration of taxation of contributions                                                                           $5,000</li></ul>
<p><strong>PROMOTION COSTS<u> </u></strong></p>
<ul><li><u>Distribution campaign for nationwide radio play                                                               $4,000</u></li></ul>
<p><strong>PROJECT TOTAL</strong>                                                                                                                                   $20,000</p>
<p><strong>* If the minimum amount of $10,000 US Dollars is not reached, all contributions will be refunded during the last week of the campaign. If this amount is reached, the remainder needed will be raised through alternative channels, including personal earnings, loans and possible cultural grants. All contributors will be kept well informed of the progress of the campaign.</strong></p>
<h3>Rewards</h3>
<p>I’m not asking for free money, and there will certainly be something in return for your contributions. Those rewards will include digital downloads and CD copies of the new record prior to release in the Autumn 2019, past published recordings from the history of my career in digital, CD and vinyl disc form, and special private performances arranged in the USA and Finland in coordination with my travel schedule.</p>
<ul></ul>

</div></div>","The Project
Everything is ready to go, and I’ve got ten good songs that I’ve written that could be classified in the Americana genre, influenced by traditional country, blues and rock n’ roll. I have the consultation and guidance of veteran Nashville professionals in the areas of production, promotion and management, as well as the opportunity to record with world class session musicians in Nashville’s legendary Hilltop Recording Studio, proven to be one of the area’s best.
BACKGROUND
The story behind this particular recording project actually began many years ago when I was a young guy working in a steel mill in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and went down to Nashville, Tennessee full of enthusiasm, hoping to get a contract with one of the big record companies. However, I was surprised to discover that I couldn’t even get past the door to any of the major labels.
Feeling pretty down, I eventually found a live music venue that was frequented by a lot of the Nashville musicians. That’s where I was fortunate to meet producer Tom Wilkerson, who at the time was a studio session drummer, as well as a touring musician with some of the biggest names in the country music scene. Tom gave me a lot of advice about what was happening there in Nashville, and he brought me to Hilltop Recording Studio, where we agreed to pull together our resources and record some of my songs.
I went back to Pittsburgh, and as young people often do, I was feeling that there was plenty of time to get that record done, so I set off rolling down that windy road playing gigs everywhere from Austin, Texas to Moscow, Russia, and eventually found myself living and performing most of my years in Finland!

Finland has been good, and my music has brought me to many other wonderful countries to perform, but through the years I’ve always regretted not following up on the opportunities that Tom was offering in Nashville.  So I decided to do something about it, and I contacted him through the internet, asking if it would still be possible to get that record made. I was soon happy to get a positive reply, and he invited me over to Nashville to talk about it.
Well I got over there and we picked up where we left off. We made a plan, and Tom also connected me with some of his professional colleagues in the industry, including influential musician, record promoter Bill Wence, and highly accredited session musician Jerry Kroon. We decided to put together a top rate team, and get back to Hilltop Recording Studio and produce my solo album.

Action
FUNDING 
With all other areas settled, now it’s time to raise the financing to cover the costs of this project. If the funding can be achieved, hopefully within about six weeks time, it could be possible to begin the recording sessions in June 2019. Expecting an effective creative process, followed by technical production, the target release date accompanied by the promotional campaign launch will be in  Autumn 2019.
The amount needed is approximately $20,000 US Dollars. Here's an estimate in rounded off figures of where the funds will be applied:
SESSION MUSICIAN FEES
10 songs 5 musicians + 1 backing vocalist + arrangements/charts                            $7,000
STUDIO COSTS
All instrumental tracks + vocal tracks + mixing and mastering                                    $4,000
ADMINISTRATIVE + PRODUCTION COSTS
Including travel, hotel, meals, CD manufacturing, shipping costs of rewards, plus consideration of taxation of contributions                                                                           $5,000
PROMOTION COSTS 
Distribution campaign for nationwide radio play                                                               $4,000
PROJECT TOTAL                                                                                                                                   $20,000
* If the minimum amount of $10,000 US Dollars is not reached, all contributions will be refunded during the last week of the campaign. If this amount is reached, the remainder needed will be raised through alternative channels, including personal earnings, loans and possible cultural grants. All contributors will be kept well informed of the progress of the campaign.
Rewards
I’m not asking for free money, and there will certainly be something in return for your contributions. Those rewards will include digital downloads and CD copies of the new record prior to release in the Autumn 2019, past published recordings from the history of my career in digital, CD and vinyl disc form, and special private performances arranged in the USA and Finland in coordination with my travel schedule.

Coming home
For the past forty years I’ve been on the road, all over the world, singing my songs, and other folks’ tunes as well. I’ve recorded as the singer in other people's bands, although I’ve always wanted to make my own record, and now I'm going to get it done. This will be my record and I’m coming home, with all that I’ve learned on my musical life's journey, and you can help make this happen.

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>Seven Times Salt has reached our fifteenth year together! To celebrate, in April 2018 we recorded one of our most beloved programs, <i>Pilgrims’ Progress: Music of the Plimoth Colony Settlers</i>, at the historic <a href=""http://www.1717meetinghouse.org/index.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">1717 Meetinghouse</a> in West Barnstable, MA. This incredible 300-year-old building has perfect acoustics for historical instruments and voices, and its walls may well have heard some of this very music. Sound engineer extraordinaire <a href=""http://www.davejamrog.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Dave Jamrog</a> recorded us over two days, and noted viol player and musicologist <a href=""http://www.brandeis.edu/facultyguide/person.html?emplid=96a30d193e82d8f8bebb1920695ef08a9fa8c4fe"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Sarah Mead</a> (a descendant of John Robinson, pastor to the original group of Pilgrims!) is our producer. <strong>The music is already recorded</strong>, and now we need your support to edit, produce, and share the CD.</p>
<h3>The Album</h3>
<p>Contrary to what the history books tell us, the Plimoth colonists or “Pilgrims” were a highly diverse group of Separatists and Anglicans, religious zealots and irreverent opportunists–many of whom had lived in the Netherlands prior to their emigration, and some of whom were Dutch. They brought with them experiences of music as diverse as their reasons for coming to the New World. Our program follows the settlers from their homes in England’s cities and countryside, to religious refuge in the Netherlands, and onward to their challenging, though fulfilling, life in Plimoth Colony. The settlers worked hard and worshipped in their new town, but also found time to entertain themselves with singing and games.  </p>
<p>The new album includes music of 1590-1650, spanning the final years of Queen Elizabeth I's reign to the early colonies of New England. You'll hear the refined music of Morley, Dowland, and van Eyck; spirited catches by Ravenscroft; selections from the Dutch <i>‘t Uitnemend Kabinet</i>, stirring psalms from Sternhold &amp; Hopkins’ <i>Whole Booke of Psalmes</i>, a boisterous drinking song or three, plus a variety of tunes from Playford's <i>The English Dancing Master</i>. You'll also hear fictional ""diary entries"" of our travelers read in original pronunciation. We first performed this Pilgrim program in 2004 and have been improving it ever since!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Costs</h3>
<p><strong>The music is already recorded</strong>, so what's left? Here's how your contribution will help:<br/>$2300 - CD editing and mastering<br/>$450 - graphic design  <br/>$1800 - CD production and shipping<br/>$200 - perk fulfilment<br/>$250 - Indiegogo fees</p>
<p>If we fall short of our goal, we will complete as much editing as possible, then produce the CD when funds allow. If we surpass our goal, we'll be able to pay our musicians for rehearsals, print additional CDs, and fund more concerts - perhaps in a neighborhood near you!</p>
<h3>Perks</h3>
<p>We have some amazing perks in store for you, including signed copies of <i>Pilgrims' Progress</i>, wine tastings, gourmet dinners with music, house concerts, Feldenkrais sessions, and tickets to Seven Times Salt's 2018-19 concert season.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Your Role</h3>
<p>We invite you to help us continue our contributions to early music and historical research. Every single gift helps, no matter the amount. Please share this with your friends and anyone else with an interest in history and culture, historical performance, and supporting the arts. Thank you!</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p> “Music has always been a matter of Energy to me, a question of Fuel. Sentimental people call it Inspiration, but what they really mean is Fuel. I have always needed Fuel. I am a serious consumer. On some nights I still believe that a car with the gas needle on empty can run about fifty more miles if you have the right music very loud on the radio.” -Hunter S. Thompson  </p>
<p>With beginnings as an acoustic duo, Winter Moon has taken many shapes and forms over the years, and right now is a musical family who inspire and challenge each other in the music that we make. </p>
<p>Like any good band we've had our ups and downs, but our persistence paid off and in August of 2014 we released our debut EP, 'Lucid Dreaming'. The final result was better than we could've imagined, 'Me And The Devil' eventually reaching the top of the Triple J Unearthed Rock Charts. In 2016 we released our second EP, 'Hearts and Hands', which built upon the success of the first and was enjoyed by fans around the world, receiving particular interest from our European fanbase.</p>
<p>This time we're going all out. We've written over twenty killer songs, which will be pared back to the best twelve or thirteen for the album. Recording once again at Head Gap studios with engineer Finn Keane means we know we'll get incredible recordings and the use of top notch studio equipment. We've got Callum Howell (Ocean Alley, Forbes St Studios) on board to mix and produce the album, the sound and success he has achieved for Ocean Alley has inspired us all and we're very excited to be working with him. We'll be utilising the talents of David Briggs (The Little River Band, The Production Workshop) to put the final polish on the master, and we'll be releasing the album on 12"" Vinyl through German record label Kozmik Artifactz. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We've been paying our own way, from our own pockets, and saving every penny we've earned from our shows towards this recording. We've saved the $4500 needed for six days at Head Gap, with Finn on the console, but the creation of an album doesn't end there.</p>
<p>We'll be forking out another $5800 for production and mixing by Callum Howell at Forbes St Studios in Sydney, and another $660 for mastering to vinyl and digital by David Briggs.</p>
<p>We'll be saving as much as we can before release time, but we also need to consider the expense of printing merchandise as rewards for you lovely people, which could run between $500-$1500, and are aiming to have at least $3000 to spend on professional publicity come Release Time - because, like the proverbial tree in the woods, you can make the greatest album of all time, but if there is no Publicist? Well, you get the idea.</p>
<p>Excitingly, we've been lucky enough to be signed by German record Label Kosmik Artifactz who will be printing and distributing the 12"" vinyl copies of the album. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We do this because we love the music we make, and we hope to affect people in the same way the music we love has affected us throughout our lives.</p>
<p>With our last EP 'Hearts and Hands', we crowd-funded over $5000  with your incredible support, and produced an album of which we are exceptionally proud. Here's what just a few of our contributors had to say:</p>
<p>-<i>""Step aside Blues Pills, we have a new Queen in heavy blues town. Winter Moon beams with soulfully seductive swoons and groove infused heavy, poppy blues licks. Adele wishes she had a band this cool to back her up.""</i> - Bucky- Reno, Nevada.</p>
<p>-<i>""Instantly infectious and charming psych-rock with rich production, great songwriting and beautiful sounds throughout. Love it!""</i> - Henrik Thogerson- Copenhagen, Denmark</p>
<p><i>-""Wonderful blues rock. Great release. I expected a great one and the band exceeded my expectations.""</i> - Bill Goodman- Chicago, Illinois</p>

Her folktronica debut album ‘The Lake’ came out in 2009, and she gigged extensively in London around that time; after moving abroad for a while, and then retraining as a music therapist, she returned to her roots and now lives and works in the Suffolk countryside – the inspiration for her ambitious new album, ‘Somewhere In The Night Time’. </p><p>The 10 songs that make up ‘Somewhere In The Night Time’ deal with loss, death, love, war, family, separation, rebirth and reconnection through nature, and feature a wider range of instrumentation and a rawer, live feel. Instead of being multi-tracked, the musicians are being recorded playing together at the same time and in the same place. It also includes ambient compositions created from nature recordings (some recorded binaurally) and found sounds which weave the tracks together. </p><p><strong>Helena says:</strong></p><p><i>“As a sound engineer and music producer I’ve always recorded in my own studio, which meant that when I wrote my debut album ‘The Lake’ I was also able to engineer and produce it myself. But after moving onto a boat to live aboard a few years back I had to dramatically downsize my studio to the bare writing essentials. It left me hungry to make a more musically ambitious album which would require more musicians and a larger, more professional space to record..”</i></p><p><i>“Luckily, I crossed paths with local studio owner Bob Kidby who has a beautiful recording studio in a Tudor barn, deep in the Suffolk countryside, not far from where I live. We clicked immediately and decided we’d work on the new project together.”</i></p><p><i>“Being a DIY musician these days comes with its challenges as well as its rewards. One reward can be a greater sense of artistic freedom; not being bound to the expectations of a record company can free an artist to produce more radical, individual and soulful work. It’s great that many music lovers are keen to support artists directly these days by bypassing the big corporations that can have a negative impact on artistic freedom. But one of the difficulties can be resources and funding.</i></p><p><i>To fully bring the songs to life I needed to collaborate and record in a professional studio; there’s also post-production, photography, artwork, CD pressing, video production, promotion and other costs to factor in..”</i></p><p><i>“So, if you feel inspired to support my work and be a part of making my new album a reality, please consider supporting my campaign by choosing one of the many perks I have on offer.

<h3>Silver Bells ready for Production!</h3>
<p>It has been three months since the campaign ended in June.  The album was recorded in July 2018. Mixing and Mastering are now completed and we are on track to send the master copy for production and replication in a few days!! Lord willing, the CDs will be ready for distribution in November 2018 instead of December, and downloads available shortly thereafter. I'll be performing songs from ""Silver Bells"" Songs of Christmas JOY! at the <u>CD release concert in the St. Louis area in November,</u> and also at a <u>Christmas concert in Lexington, KY</u>. I'm excited! to say the least. </p>
<h3>Inspiration</h3>
<p>A few years ago, I created Christmas videos that I shared with my family and friends. That was my inspiration to record an official full-length Christmas album that I could share with more people. Since then I have been dreaming and praying for the chance to record and produce my first Christmas album.</p>
<p>My faith in God kept my dream alive as I moved around for work as Technology Consultant and Contractor. Then in 2015, I decided to accept a 3-month contract working in St. Louis. and I've been living and singing in the St. Louis area ever since. I didn't know then, but I now believe that divine intervention brought me back to St. Louis to fulfill my dream.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Why This Recording</h3>
<p><strong>My goal is to share my musical gift with you and the next generation, especially now when our world needs to hear songs that encourage, lift our spirits, and give us hope.</strong> </p>
<p>Listeners have said that my singing voice inspires them through clear tones, authenticity, and warmth. One listener said my singing voice is “refreshing and uplifting”.

<p>Hi, friends!  Here is a little bit <strong>about me, my story and how LIGHTNING came to be:</strong></p>
<p>My name is Lexi Adams, I'm from a small town located in Southwest Michigan called Plainwell.  I moved to Nashville Tennesee shortly after graduating high school to pursue a career in songwriting and music.  Once I graduated college, I attended  ministry school through my church in Nashville; there I learned how to hear God's voice, experience His heart for me, while gaining so many other invaluable tools to add to my ""tool-belt"" for my walk with God and life.  After 3 years of ministry school, I decided it was time to start taking my music career a bit more seriously-- cowrites, songwriters rounds and house shows were great!  but I decided it was time for more.  That ""deciding"" turned into an audition to be a part of the Saints and Sinners tour, which led me to meet Mitch Parks who believed in me as an artist &amp;  enjoyed the songs I wrote, which then led to the recording of 5 original songs for my EP titled, ""Lightning.""</p>
<p>Two months after finishing the recording process, I got really sick-- so sick, to the point I couldn't leave my house for over two weeks!  During that time, I knew something needed to change and well, lets just say after that I packed up all my stuff and moved back home to Michigan after having lived in Nashville for over 8 years.  It was a bit of an adjustment at first but, here I am living back in my hometown, playing music around town (more than I ever was in Nashville) and loving every moment of it!</p>
<p><strong>So what's next?</strong></p>
<p>It's time to finally RELEASE ""Lightning,"" it's been a 2 year process and I'm ready for Lightning to get out for the world to hear, BUT! I can't do it without YOU!  The plan is to go back down to Nashville and FILM a live performance of my entire EP (with a band, in a studio). Once the film has been edited, the songs mix and mastered, I'd then release one video of a song, per week a month before the record release. This will not only help promote the EP, but it will also generate a buzz for the release of the record, as well as build visual content for people to see who I am!  Essentially, you would help me make these videos for the world to see Lexi Adams, as well as hear Lightning. </p>
<p><span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'>Now that LIGHTNING has been recorded </span><strong style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'>what will your contributions help me achieve?</strong></p>
<p>Working with the best musicians, producers, videographers, and studios comes at a high price!  But SO worth it.  Your donations will go toward:</p>
<p>1) Hiring a professional videographer who will film the live performance of Lightning  </p>
<p>2) Hiring studio musicians </p>
<p>3) Mixing and mastering fees for each live recorded song.</p>
<p>4)  Studio fees</p>
<p>Anything left over will go toward expenses for merchandise, CD’s and touring.</p>
<p><strong>But where//to whom exactly is the money going?</strong></p>
<p>The goal is to raise $5,000!  Yikes, that is a scary number to ask for, but I'm going for it, folks!  This is where the money will be going: </p>
</div><div>
<p>-Videography= $2,500</p>
<p>-Musicians=$500 each (there are 3 of them)</p>
<p>-Mix//Mastering and Studio fees= $1,000</p>
<p>If you decide to contribute, here are <strong>your perks:</strong></p>
<p>1) $10+ a hand-written letter, expressing my gratitude and appreciation, as well as a link to download my song, ""Lightning.""</p>
<p>2) $25+ all the above, plus a signed CD of my EP, as well as a digital download of the EP. </p>
<p>3) $50+ all the above, plus a poster of my face-- you know you want that!</p>
<p>3) $100+ all the above, plus a song written, just for YOU.</p>
<p>4) $150+ all the above, plus a shoutout on my instgram and facebook, as well as a ""Lexi Adams"" mug.</p>
<p>5) $200+ all the above, plus a notebook and a (my favorite kind) pen, with a handwritten, encouraging note, just for you.</p>
<p>6) $300+ all the above, plus a Lexi AdamsT-shirt, and a video posted of the song I wrote for you posted on my music facebook page, for all the people that follow me to hear!</p>
<p>6) $500+ all of the above, plus all the swag you could think of! Guest lists and backstage passes to the album release show.</p>
<p>7) $750+ all of the above, plus a free concert at your house or wherever you choose to have me! (within 50 mile radius).</p>
<p>Than YOU for helping me make my dream a reality! You are the reason why I am able to DO THIS!  Wow, YOU my friend, are amazing!!</p>
<p>Describe where the <strong>funds go if you don't reach your entire goal:</strong></p>
<p>If I don't reach my goal, I will use the bit of money I have made through this campaign and put it towards my record and the release of it:  merchandise, finding//hiring a band, promoting the EP by doing a small tour, etc. </p>
<p>A little more of my (real//raw) <strong>heart for the project:</strong></p>
</div><div>
<p>It's hard to ask for money, in fact, I hate it.  I think most people could probably agree with me here.  I have found that I am at constant war with myself as I've contemplated starting an Indiegogo Campaign.  1) As I already said, I don't like asking for money. 2) What if I don't raise a single dollar?!  It's a tad vulnerable. 3) The weird stigma with artists//musicians doing Crowdfunding campaigns. Yet, it's all a risk I'm willing to take!</p>
<p>So, with the little bit of courage I can muster here I'm going to (try) put these insecurities to rest as I choose to trust the journey. It's scary, fun, exhilarating, lots of questions and doubts, BUT I'm going to hold on to the fun and exhilarating part of it as I continue to say, ""YES"" to this wild ride.  So what do you think?  Think you might wanna come with? </p>
<p><strong>Other Ways You Can Help:</strong></p>
</div><div>
<p>If you are unable to give financially, that is OKAY!  I would greatly appreciate if  you sharing this campaign, as well as promoting Lightning through different social media outlets:  facebook, Instagram, twitter, snapchat, and any others that I don't know about:)</p>
<p><span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'>You guys mean the world to me!  I cannot thank you enough for believing in me, championing me, cheering me on, and always encouraging me.  It's time to take things to the next level in my music career! It's GO TIME!</span></p>

7) $750+ all of the above, plus a free concert at your house or wherever you choose to have me! (within 50 mile radius).
Than YOU for helping me make my dream a reality! You are the reason why I am able to DO THIS!  Wow, YOU my friend, are amazing!!
Describe where the funds go if you don't reach your entire goal:
If I don't reach my goal, I will use the bit of money I have made through this campaign and put it towards my record and the release of it:  merchandise, finding//hiring a band, promoting the EP by doing a small tour, etc. 
A little more of my (real//raw) heart for the project:

It's hard to ask for money, in fact, I hate it.  I think most people could probably agree with me here.  I have found that I am at constant war with myself as I've contemplated starting an Indiegogo Campaign.  1) As I already said, I don't like asking for money. 2) What if I don't raise a single dollar?!  It's a tad vulnerable. 3) The weird stigma with artists//musicians doing Crowdfunding campaigns. Yet, it's all a risk I'm willing to take!
So, with the little bit of courage I can muster here I'm going to (try) put these insecurities to rest as I choose to trust the journey. It's scary, fun, exhilarating, lots of questions and doubts, BUT I'm going to hold on to the fun and exhilarating part of it as I continue to say, ""YES"" to this wild ride.  So what do you think?  Think you might wanna come with? 
Other Ways You Can Help:

If you are unable to give financially, that is OKAY!  I would greatly appreciate if  you sharing this campaign, as well as promoting Lightning through different social media outlets:  facebook, Instagram, twitter, snapchat, and any others that I don't know about:)
You guys mean the world to me!  I cannot thank you enough for believing in me, championing me, cheering me on, and always encouraging me.  It's time to take things to the next level in my music career! It's GO TIME!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>""<i>What is this</i>?""</h3>
<p>We are Buddhist rock band darshan Pulse (dP), a band born in the musically rich community of Missoula, Montana, in the heart of the Rocky Mountains. After publishing our debut concept album in the spring of 2010, we've worked continuously on our second concept album: Olive Moksha (OM). This ambitious project was crafted with the intention of guiding the listener on a wordless journey, which tells a timeless story of three monks as they navigate life, death, and rebirth. The story takes us from dukkha (worldly suffering) to anatta (the doctrine of non-self).</p>
<p>We think about cycles so much that we also produce all kinds of other art related to our continuous contemplation of cycles, much of which is inexorably tied to this album. After 8 years of blood, sweat and tears, every aspect of the entire project is finally complete. The proprietary theory is invented and fleshed out, the songs are written and recorded, the performances are mixed and mastered, the art is drawn and colored; the story is almost complete. Now it's time to make some copies, and share our truth with fellow seekers! </p>
<h3>Listen Now!</h3>
<p>Want to listen to the entire album right now, to make sure it's worth your hard-earned coin? Digital download of the album is available on our Bandcamp page for just $10, and listening is always free! See what we're all about while helping us realize this dream:</p>
<p><a href=""https://darshanpulse.bandcamp.com/releases"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://darshanpulse.bandcamp.com/releases</a></p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We aim to get Olive Moksha printed, published and promoted. Our goal is to press 2,000 CDs and send half to a promoter, with the intention of getting this music into the playlists of as many College and Non-Profit Radio stations as possible. Our total aspiration of $9,905 breaks down like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>CDs will be printed on 6-Panel digipack, just like the first album. Oasis Disk Manufacturing has quoted the cost of printing at approximately $3,005.22.</li>
<li>Oasis quotes 200 double-disc LPs (so 4 LP sides per set), at $5,200.34. High quality vinyl prints will last longer than CDs and include enlarged album art. Unlike the rest of our perks, vinyl is highly contingent upon successfully meeting the total goal - <i>6/7/18 Update: based on response so far, we are not pursuing vinyl reproduction at this time. Can't win if you don't play ;) </i>
</li>
<li>Additionally, we intend to hire a promoter to help us spread the love to College Radio stations around the country, estimated at around $1,200.</li>
<li>We owe our film guy $400 dollars for his outstanding work on our video.</li>
<li>We'll need $100 minimum to print posters. We can't know this number for sure until we know how many posters to print. That number will remain unknown until the campaign's conclusion.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<p>You can also get your hands on  prints with exclusive hand-drawn album art. Four detailed and meditative art prints available to contributors: Water Snake Mandala (13'' x 19''), Golden Rabbit Mandala (13'' x 19''), Gabriowl (18'' x 24''), Stovehenge (24'' x 24''), and the Universal Calendar (24'' x 24''). See images below! </p>
<h3>Impact</h3>
<p>We have found time and time again that music can produce dramatic alterations in consciousness; we wonder to what extent music can change the world for the better. It seems that producing this album transformed the lives of everyone involved with it, in ways simple and complex. To what extent might these melodies change your own life for the greatest good?</p>
<p>We successfully printed our last project in the same way we're printing this one, but we never made an effort to get it heard outside of our city. We feel that our intentions behind this project reflect a maturation of aesthetic expression. May the inspiration and joy of these transcendent melodies brighten days, ease spirits and inspire thoughts!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Assuming we don't meet our goal, our priorities are organized thus:</p>
<p>-Print at least 500 copies of the CD, print our art and stickers to order, and get those copies to our contributors.</p>
<p>-With the leftover copies, get at least 50% to online reviewers and college radio stations that play progressive and indy rock.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Some people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean they can't help:</p>

</ul>
<h3>Background: The Story</h3>
<p>Dukkha, the state of suffering and want, begins our tale. Upon this background the curtains rise on three monks, performing their daily duties at a nameless monastery. They cut wood, carry water, tell stories (Vihara Devoir).</p>
<p>On the monastery grounds there is an olive orchard, where the monks work and meditate . One night, while the monks are meditating under an ancient olive tree, Avalokiteshvara, an enlightened being, appears to them in a vision. He tells them to leave the orchard and become bodhisattvas to wander the earth spreading good works. They immediately depart, giving their lives over to public service, each having a grand adventure and struggle greater than the next (Wandering Bhikkhu). By and by, they live out their lives, gradually winding down, passing peaceably into the spirit world without malice or despair. Their bodies are sent back to the monastery for burial (Request to Laura).</p>
<p>Upon death, each of them sees for the first time the transient nature of all things -- a movement of lightness and air enters them. They pass through the bardos between death and rebirth, first re-experiencing their lightest thoughts and moments of fleeting grace (Pala Moksha), followed swiftly by a re-telling of their darkest, most selfish thoughts, and moments of weakness (Sidpa Bardo). Unable to remain coalesced into a separate Will, facing an unknowable choice between rebirth and nirvana, each monk's selfhood is torn apart in the transition (Tulku Bhava).</p>
<p>Years pass, and three children are born, each somewhere in the first world (Ici Avant). They come of age in an ailing society, overfull with violence and thoughtlessness, and struggle with the desire to take the right action instead of the easiest action. Desperate for an answer to the deepest questions that plague them, they each search for their own Truth, wherever it may lead (Quarry Unhewn). By and by, through hill and vale, the children find themselves at the doors of an ancient monastery. The scent of fruit oil and brine fills the air with peace and sweetness.</p>
<p>The abbot of the monastery meets with each child. It is clear from their meeting that this is not the first time they have met. The children know too much at too young an age. The children and the abbot talk long into the night, contrasting stories of a bygone time of a natural rise and fall with those of woes of present unmet wants. Exhausted from the revelation, the children stay the night at the orchard, sleeping under an old half-dead tree (Padme in the Orchard).</p>
<p>During the night, the children are visited by Avalokiteshvara in a shared dream. They see that their seemingly separate personalities are actually three emanations of a singular presence as their consciousnesses merge with that of the transcendent being. They awaken at once to the brightness of the full moon, she having suddenly slipped off her blanket of cloud. Having momentarily stepped into a larger world, they are struck still by the realization of Anatta, or no-self; that there is no difference between themselves, the old monks, and the Bodhisattva nature of all sentient beings. They rise with the Knowledge, the Sight, and the Truth. Whether they live long and well, it is not for us to say. But having experienced Moksha, they are free.</p>
<h3>Background: The Theory</h3>
<p>Disclaimer: This part is really only for the musicians, mathematicians, or other insufferable know-it-alls -- other people too, of course, but generally ones adept in their nature.  ;)  </p>
<p>The basic idea/assumption that generated the music theory and musical forms that underlie Olive Moksha is this: that the scale a melody is played in has a reliable emotional affect. Usually this is limited, in most music, to major (a happy, uplifting, simple-sounding scale) and minor (an introspective, darker, complex-sounding scale). Our composer realized that major and minor are simply permutations of the same underlying circular sequence, only starting in different locations.</p>
<p>For those that know the Do-Re-Mi song from The Sound of Music: Major starts its scale on the Do, but minor starts its scale on the La. (If you imagine singing La Ti Do Re Mi Fa So La, for example, that's a minor scale). Thus it's a clear logical extension to consider the other scales as well - the unnamed ones that end on Re, Mi, Fa, So, and Ti. </p>
<p>Turns out, surprising no one, these scales have been around since the time of the Greeks, and got the names we know them by in the 1200s - they are called Ionian, Dorian, Phrygian, Lydian, Aeolian and Locrian - and they have the ability to paint melodies in more subtle shades of emotion than just Happy and Sad. But it goes much deeper.</p>
<p>Those that have some experience with concert band or private musical lessons will also be familiar with the scales of Harmonic Minor and Melodic Minor - these scales mostly came about because composers wanted to have the satisfying linear harmonic motion they get so easily in a V-I major cadence, but transposed into minor. Crucially, these scales don't overlap with the major/minor sequence - they are wholly new seven-note sequences, each with their own unique Do, Re, Mi, etc., on which new scales of a more exotic nature are revealed. </p>
<p>By way of example, one scale we employ, which we gave the moniker of ""Romantic"", has a sweetly sour nostalgic warmth to it. It's also the fifth mode of the Melodic Minor scale, starting on the relevant So. In C, meaning all the white keys, it would be C major with a B flat instead of a B and an Ab flat instead of an A; in A, the same scale would be A minor with a C sharp. This means, in terms of Romantic's emotional qualities, it lies two steps away from Major, and one step away from Minor. The fact that this scale has the emotional quality that it does  -- lying closer to minor than major on the emotional axis -- is not coincidence.</p>
<p>Of course, every theory has its limits. Even though we find a total of 28 potential scales, derived from 4 unique seven-note sequences, a sizable minority of them are unsuitable for practical reasons. (The main problem is that 3 of these scales have an unstable augmented chord as their Do, or root note, and 7 have a diminished chord. No good -- they are just too far from major and minor, harmonically, to make sense to our Western ears, music appreciation being a subjective and fickle cultural beast.) Thus we are left with 18 scales on which to base our emotional narrative: four scales each from Melodic Minor, Harmonic Minor, and Harmonic Major; and six scales from the Major sequence, the original Sound-of-Music Do-Re-Mi. </p>
<p>This explanation really only scratches the surface of a three dimensional musical solid, so go listen to the Bandcamp if you're still interested after all this. If the tunes appeal to you, and you want to know more, please contact us! And buy a track or two. :) (There's a related music theory perk for the truly hardcore.)<br/><br/>Here's an early-adolescent version of the main part of the theory, in case you're interested. (The fully fleshed-out version remains behind closed doors, for now.) <a href=""https://zarvoc.wordpress.com/2009/05/29/the-circle-of-melodic-dissonance/#more-42"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://zarvoc.wordpress.com/2009/05/29/the-circle-of-melodic-dissonance/#more-42 </a></p>
<h3>Background: The Universal Calendar</h3>
<p>Clocks are circular, and depict time, which certainly varies regularly, in predictable cycles. In the modern world, we track days with a sweeping hand, tracing out the same daily patterns and routines. However, our post-industrial monitoring of weeks and months is linear, tracing a straight line towards the unknown. We imagine ourselves standing on an infinite sidewalk down a main thoroughfare, with the unknowable future blocks ahead and the forgotten past blocks behind. </p>
<p>Other cultures don't necessarily share this linear fascination; the Zodiac contains one cycle of time, the Hindu Yugas a second, the Mayans a third. Even the sky itself spins slowly in its own lazy circle. Each foretells rises and falls. Thus our artist and illustrator was inspired to design a Universal Calendar for the album's cover, depicting several cycles simultaneously. On the outermost rim, the I Ching awaits us, followed by the Hindu Yugas, the Mayan Ha'ab and Tzolkin calendars, and the Western Zodiac, all held together by the nine-triangled Sri Yantra. The combined wisdom of these otherwise disparate calendar systems allows for the realization that while we might each focus on different bits of the pattern, we are all watching the same fireworks show.</p>

<h3>Final Thoughts</h3>
<p>Obviously, the members of darshan Pulse are amendable to Buddhist doctrine in one form or other. We aren't Bodhisattvas, but we hold those that are in the highest regard, and aspire to do better. We believe that the highest cause is to work in the service of the cessation of others' suffering.</p>
<p>We are drops of dew on a web, interconnected and interdependent, awaiting the Light that will vanquish us to the dawn sky until the moon but rise again. </p>

Unlike the rest of our perks, vinyl is highly contingent upon successfully meeting the total goal - 6/7/18 Update: based on response so far, we are not pursuing vinyl reproduction at this time. Can't win if you don't play ;) 

Additionally, we intend to hire a promoter to help us spread the love to College Radio stations around the country, estimated at around $1,200.
We owe our film guy $400 dollars for his outstanding work on our video.
We'll need $100 minimum to print posters. We can't know this number for sure until we know how many posters to print. That number will remain unknown until the campaign's conclusion.


You can also get your hands on  prints with exclusive hand-drawn album art. Four detailed and meditative art prints available to contributors: Water Snake Mandala (13'' x 19''), Golden Rabbit Mandala (13'' x 19''), Gabriowl (18'' x 24''), Stovehenge (24'' x 24''), and the Universal Calendar (24'' x 24''). See images below! 
Impact
We have found time and time again that music can produce dramatic alterations in consciousness; we wonder to what extent music can change the world for the better. It seems that producing this album transformed the lives of everyone involved with it, in ways simple and complex. To what extent might these melodies change your own life for the greatest good?
We successfully printed our last project in the same way we're printing this one, but we never made an effort to get it heard outside of our city. We feel that our intentions behind this project reflect a maturation of aesthetic expression. May the inspiration and joy of these transcendent melodies brighten days, ease spirits and inspire thoughts!

Risks & Challenges
Assuming we don't meet our goal, our priorities are organized thus:
-Print at least 500 copies of the CD, print our art and stickers to order, and get those copies to our contributors.
-With the leftover copies, get at least 50% to online reviewers and college radio stations that play progressive and indy rock.

Background: The Story
Dukkha, the state of suffering and want, begins our tale. Upon this background the curtains rise on three monks, performing their daily duties at a nameless monastery. They cut wood, carry water, tell stories (Vihara Devoir).
On the monastery grounds there is an olive orchard, where the monks work and meditate . One night, while the monks are meditating under an ancient olive tree, Avalokiteshvara, an enlightened being, appears to them in a vision. He tells them to leave the orchard and become bodhisattvas to wander the earth spreading good works. They immediately depart, giving their lives over to public service, each having a grand adventure and struggle greater than the next (Wandering Bhikkhu). By and by, they live out their lives, gradually winding down, passing peaceably into the spirit world without malice or despair. Their bodies are sent back to the monastery for burial (Request to Laura).
Upon death, each of them sees for the first time the transient nature of all things -- a movement of lightness and air enters them. They pass through the bardos between death and rebirth, first re-experiencing their lightest thoughts and moments of fleeting grace (Pala Moksha), followed swiftly by a re-telling of their darkest, most selfish thoughts, and moments of weakness (Sidpa Bardo). Unable to remain coalesced into a separate Will, facing an unknowable choice between rebirth and nirvana, each monk's selfhood is torn apart in the transition (Tulku Bhava).
Years pass, and three children are born, each somewhere in the first world (Ici Avant). They come of age in an ailing society, overfull with violence and thoughtlessness, and struggle with the desire to take the right action instead of the easiest action. Desperate for an answer to the deepest questions that plague them, they each search for their own Truth, wherever it may lead (Quarry Unhewn). By and by, through hill and vale, the children find themselves at the doors of an ancient monastery. The scent of fruit oil and brine fills the air with peace and sweetness.
The abbot of the monastery meets with each child. It is clear from their meeting that this is not the first time they have met. The children know too much at too young an age. The children and the abbot talk long into the night, contrasting stories of a bygone time of a natural rise and fall with those of woes of present unmet wants. Exhausted from the revelation, the children stay the night at the orchard, sleeping under an old half-dead tree (Padme in the Orchard).
During the night, the children are visited by Avalokiteshvara in a shared dream. They see that their seemingly separate personalities are actually three emanations of a singular presence as their consciousnesses merge with that of the transcendent being. They awaken at once to the brightness of the full moon, she having suddenly slipped off her blanket of cloud. Having momentarily stepped into a larger world, they are struck still by the realization of Anatta, or no-self; that there is no difference between themselves, the old monks, and the Bodhisattva nature of all sentient beings. They rise with the Knowledge, the Sight, and the Truth. Whether they live long and well, it is not for us to say. But having experienced Moksha, they are free.
Background: The Theory
Disclaimer: This part is really only for the musicians, mathematicians, or other insufferable know-it-alls -- other people too, of course, but generally ones adept in their nature.  ;)  
The basic idea/assumption that generated the music theory and musical forms that underlie Olive Moksha is this: that the scale a melody is played in has a reliable emotional affect. Usually this is limited, in most music, to major (a happy, uplifting, simple-sounding scale) and minor (an introspective, darker, complex-sounding scale). Our composer realized that major and minor are simply permutations of the same underlying circular sequence, only starting in different locations.
For those that know the Do-Re-Mi song from The Sound of Music: Major starts its scale on the Do, but minor starts its scale on the La. (If you imagine singing La Ti Do Re Mi Fa So La, for example, that's a minor scale). Thus it's a clear logical extension to consider the other scales as well - the unnamed ones that end on Re, Mi, Fa, So, and Ti. 
Turns out, surprising no one, these scales have been around since the time of the Greeks, and got the names we know them by in the 1200s - they are called Ionian, Dorian, Phrygian, Lydian, Aeolian and Locrian - and they have the ability to paint melodies in more subtle shades of emotion than just Happy and Sad. But it goes much deeper.
Those that have some experience with concert band or private musical lessons will also be familiar with the scales of Harmonic Minor and Melodic Minor - these scales mostly came about because composers wanted to have the satisfying linear harmonic motion they get so easily in a V-I major cadence, but transposed into minor. Crucially, these scales don't overlap with the major/minor sequence - they are wholly new seven-note sequences, each with their own unique Do, Re, Mi, etc., on which new scales of a more exotic nature are revealed. 
By way of example, one scale we employ, which we gave the moniker of ""Romantic"", has a sweetly sour nostalgic warmth to it. It's also the fifth mode of the Melodic Minor scale, starting on the relevant So. In C, meaning all the white keys, it would be C major with a B flat instead of a B and an Ab flat instead of an A; in A, the same scale would be A minor with a C sharp. This means, in terms of Romantic's emotional qualities, it lies two steps away from Major, and one step away from Minor. The fact that this scale has the emotional quality that it does  -- lying closer to minor than major on the emotional axis -- is not coincidence.
Of course, every theory has its limits. Even though we find a total of 28 potential scales, derived from 4 unique seven-note sequences, a sizable minority of them are unsuitable for practical reasons. (The main problem is that 3 of these scales have an unstable augmented chord as their Do, or root note, and 7 have a diminished chord. No good -- they are just too far from major and minor, harmonically, to make sense to our Western ears, music appreciation being a subjective and fickle cultural beast.) Thus we are left with 18 scales on which to base our emotional narrative: four scales each from Melodic Minor, Harmonic Minor, and Harmonic Major; and six scales from the Major sequence, the original Sound-of-Music Do-Re-Mi. 
This explanation really only scratches the surface of a three dimensional musical solid, so go listen to the Bandcamp if you're still interested after all this. If the tunes appeal to you, and you want to know more, please contact us! And buy a track or two. :) (There's a related music theory perk for the truly hardcore.)Here's an early-adolescent version of the main part of the theory, in case you're interested. (The fully fleshed-out version remains behind closed doors, for now.) https://zarvoc.wordpress.com/2009/05/29/the-circle-of-melodic-dissonance/#more-42 
Background: The Universal Calendar
Clocks are circular, and depict time, which certainly varies regularly, in predictable cycles. In the modern world, we track days with a sweeping hand, tracing out the same daily patterns and routines. However, our post-industrial monitoring of weeks and months is linear, tracing a straight line towards the unknown. We imagine ourselves standing on an infinite sidewalk down a main thoroughfare, with the unknowable future blocks ahead and the forgotten past blocks behind. 
Other cultures don't necessarily share this linear fascination; the Zodiac contains one cycle of time, the Hindu Yugas a second, the Mayans a third. Even the sky itself spins slowly in its own lazy circle. Each foretells rises and falls. Thus our artist and illustrator was inspired to design a Universal Calendar for the album's cover, depicting several cycles simultaneously. On the outermost rim, the I Ching awaits us, followed by the Hindu Yugas, the Mayan Ha'ab and Tzolkin calendars, and the Western Zodiac, all held together by the nine-triangled Sri Yantra. The combined wisdom of these otherwise disparate calendar systems allows for the realization that while we might each focus on different bits of the pattern, we are all watching the same fireworks show.

Final Thoughts
Obviously, the members of darshan Pulse are amendable to Buddhist doctrine in one form or other. We aren't Bodhisattvas, but we hold those that are in the highest regard, and aspire to do better. We believe that the highest cause is to work in the service of the cessation of others' suffering.
We are drops of dew on a web, interconnected and interdependent, awaiting the Light that will vanquish us to the dawn sky until the moon but rise again.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Flatpack Opera</h3>
<p>We are Flatpack Opera,  a group of young musicians based in Aberdeen who studied at or are still studying in the Music Department at the University of Aberdeen. </p>
<p>We are seeking funds to help produce three short operas for children which will be performed in schools in Aberdeen in February 2019. The project is managed by composer Joe Stollery and librettist Ruth Rose - we worked together in 2017 on the Silver City Stories project in Aberdeen. Inspired by our experiences, and the appeal of the format of “pop-up” operas, we are creating three new operas that are specifically designed for children; they are portable and can be bundled into a car to travel around performing to various school groups in Aberdeen, with workshops attached to the performances to engage children in the whole experience of opera.</p>
<p>We need to raise another £2040 for production costs to along with the money we have been awarded by Aberdeen City Council through the 2018 Year of Young People Creative Funding process.</p>
<p>You can pledge as much as you like, but we've added some perks as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>£20 gets you a copy of the musical score of one of the operas, signed by the creators Ruth Rose and Joe Stollery.</li>
<li>£50 gets you a signed copy of the music and one of the stars of Arloe the Anteater (Arloe,  Llama, Whale or Sloth).</li>
<li>£500 gets you a signed copy of the music, all the stars of the opera and your own private performance by arrangement  somewhere in Aberdeen on Friday 22nd February 2019.</li>
</ul>
<p>Ruth says: ""The main idea behind this project is to make opera more accessible. The words and music are specifically designed to be family-oriented with topics that are interesting to children. The three operas are much shorter than normal operas at around 10-15 minutes each. The cast for each opera is made up of three singers accompanied by violin and cello. I've always had a passion for opera and I know that it can sometimes appear daunting, but we're hoping that these new operas will help change the perspectives of the next generation of opera-goers.""</p>
<p>Joe says, ""I’ve composed four short operas over the past few years, including <i>The Maiden Stone </i>which was performed on the slopes of Bennachie in Aberdeenshire and which involved schoolchildren from 5 local primary schools.  I met Ruth when we were working on the Encouraging New Opera project run by Aberdeen University and Scottish Opera and I am looking forward to working with her again on these operas! It's really important that young people get access to something as powerful as opera so creating these short pieces will hopefully be a way into it for people who wouldn't normally go to hear one.""</p>
<p>Please help our cause of you are able to and please also share this project with others who you think might be interested. Your support is very much appreciated!</p>

<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">I am a rock singer and songwriter from Deep River, Canada. I’m the first Canadian-born generation to immigrant parents from Trinidad &amp; Tobago (#jumpup), with ancestral roots originating in India (#zen).</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">My musical style is best described as a unique marriage of symphonic rock with the melodies and instruments of the east weaved. Imagine heavy guitars, soaring orchestras, killer drums all balanced with the delicate instruments of India such as sitar, sarangi, tabla and santoor. These instruments aren’t just an accent or a hook, they inform the song from the moment I first put pen to paper and often, the rock elements are built around the Indian ones. On my last record “Samsara”, I had twelve (!) musicians directly contribute to my project and true to form, this new EP will have a similar scale.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">It’s been two years since the release of “Samsara” and I’m hungry again to return to the studio. Featuring all, new, original material, this EP will be the fourth major project I’ve released since 2009 (never mind the few singles and collaborations that exist out there on the interweb). This time around, the legendary Joost Van Den Broek is sitting in the producer’s chair and I’ve got a team of amazing collaborators around the world ready to help breathe life into this project.</p>

</div></div>","I am a rock singer and songwriter from Deep River, Canada. I’m the first Canadian-born generation to immigrant parents from Trinidad & Tobago (#jumpup), with ancestral roots originating in India (#zen).
My musical style is best described as a unique marriage of symphonic rock with the melodies and instruments of the east weaved. Imagine heavy guitars, soaring orchestras, killer drums all balanced with the delicate instruments of India such as sitar, sarangi, tabla and santoor. These instruments aren’t just an accent or a hook, they inform the song from the moment I first put pen to paper and often, the rock elements are built around the Indian ones. On my last record “Samsara”, I had twelve (!) musicians directly contribute to my project and true to form, this new EP will have a similar scale.
It’s been two years since the release of “Samsara” and I’m hungry again to return to the studio. Featuring all, new, original material, this EP will be the fourth major project I’ve released since 2009 (never mind the few singles and collaborations that exist out there on the interweb). This time around, the legendary Joost Van Den Broek is sitting in the producer’s chair and I’ve got a team of amazing collaborators around the world ready to help breathe life into this project.

 

“Rani Chatoorgoon is unknown to me but what a discovery I have just made. Her voice is beautiful sometimes it’s like an angel sings and it goes well with the musical style.” ~ Louis Hamel (full review here)
Since 2009 I’ve been releasing music independently, traveling and living around the world to better refine my sound. I’ve been influenced by a wide range of artists including Within Temptation, Evanescence, Sarah McLachlan, Loreena McKennit, The Cranberries and A.R. Rahman.
I always try to tell a story through my music. A story rooted in the truths as I’ve come to know them. Whether that story is one I’ve experienced or one I’ve observed, I write about people, their light and dark sides, about events in this world and their consequences so that collectively, my songs become a diary of the life I’ve led. My last record was warmly embraced by critics around the world who opened their minds to an unfamiliar style and credited the scale of the production and uniqueness of the music (read more reviews here).
Check out some of my music videos.

               

 


 

Funding productions on this scale is challenging and as a solo, unsigned artist, that challenge falls solely to me. But if you’re still reading this, then now’s the time to explain how your support of this project will be invested.
Here's how the budget breaks down:



Stretch Goal:
If the campaign reaches the stretch goal of $15,000, I will be investing the incremental $3,000 in producing a professional music video for the lead single.
 

There are a variety of perks and rewards available as an exclusive thank you for supporting my project – perks I hope will sweeten the appeal.
THE EP!
Of course the music is the point of it all, so naturally, this is included in the perks, in both digital and physical formats.
TSHIRTS!
Everyone loves a nice t-shirt and I’ve got one up for grabs in an exclusive perk, available only through this campaign. Designed and drawn by moi, snag it in your size and style!
UNIQUE DRAWINGS!
This was a very popular perk the last time I crowdfunded. Secure this perk for a one-of-a-kind art piece, similar to the ones below, hand-drawn by me.

LIVE WEB PERFORMANCE
You, me, a little chai, a little chat and an acoustic sing a-long, thanks to technology. Skype, Facetime, iMessenger – grab this perk and let’s meet ‘face to face’.
Explore the full list of perks available on the right side of this campaign page.
 


Every dollar counts. For everyone. I know you’ve got priorities to manage in your own life, so if you’re unable to contribute to the campaign financially, your help would be most valued in the following ways:
SHARE this campaign via the indiegogo tools to spread the word to as many people as possible, all around the world!

<p>We are <strong>The Village Bicycle</strong>, a <strong>feminist psych rock band</strong> from <strong>Cleveland, Ohio</strong>. Because we are brave and hardy warriors, <strong>we are putting our lives in a van</strong> for two weeks, inside which we will travel to exotic locales outside of Cleveland to do our favorite things: <b>bring people together and make noise </b>in anticipation of our new album <i><strong>Terraforma</strong></i>, to be released in early 2018, We're happy to have partnered with Sony's The Orchard, who will make the album available to stream digitally before it's officially released.</p>
<p>If you are interested in being a part of our story by donating to our tour fund, your contribution will help us with important expenses such as: <strong>a trailer rental and trailer hitch, gas for the van, food and sundries, vehicle repair, and any emergency expenses that arise while on the road such as lodging and instrument repair. </strong></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>When we break down the expenses, it looks approximately like this:</p>
<p><strong>Trailer hitch and trailer rental</strong>: $500</p>
<p><strong>Gas</strong> (mpg 19 city/28 highway): $300</p>
<p><strong>Tolls</strong>: $50</p>
<p><strong>Food, sundries, misc</strong>: $560 ($10 per person per day)</p>
<p>That brings us to <strong>$1,410</strong>, which, if we reach our $2000 goal, leaves <strong>$590 </strong>for unplanned expenses and emergencies. We will be putting our show earnings directly into the above categories as well. Should there be money leftover, <strong>every cent will be invested directly back into the band in the form of merchandise, </strong>which will be distributed to <strong>you</strong> as a <strong>thankyougoddessblessyou</strong> for your donation. </p>
<h3>Impact</h3>
</div><div><p>This unique opportunity to go into the world and <strong>sing about what we're passionate about</strong> and <b>yell about what we're pissed about</b> was borne of a lot of time and hard work and dedication - not for money or fame, but <strong>for love</strong>.  <strong>The artists of the world show us the center of balance between the tips of our noses and the looming gray nothing, and our hope is to contribute to this human effort of reminding people that we're alive.</strong> It's being said a lot these days, but we as a society<strong> need</strong> <strong>art and music and color</strong> now more than ever. </p></div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The Village Bicycle leaves for tour on <strong>November 8th</strong>, so time is of the essence! This indiegogo will be up for <strong>44</strong><strong> days</strong> before we hit the road, so if you choose to donate, please do so at your earliest convenience. We understand the financial struggle, and <strong>appreciate any amount you choose to contribute, large or small or none at all. </strong></p>
<p>We have an awesome list of stuff to give to you at every donation level, and we'll be sending all the prize packages (including the new album!) to production as soon as we get back from traveling. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you enjoy the music of The Village Bicycle or enjoy us as people (or even both!) <strong>please</strong> <strong>let your friends know that we're coming to their city. </strong>We want to meet all the people, we're very friendly and enjoy good company and good beer. We will be posting tour dates on this page, as well as our <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/villagebicyclemusic/?fref=ts"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Facebook</a> page, so stay tuned for updates. </p>

<h3>32 contemporary piano pieces…</h3>

<p>For all his life, he's been promoting the new music, mainly the music of other composers and thus contributing to the musical life of our country. He educated dozens of young composers, professional musicians and music teachers. It is difficult for us to express our gratitude in words. </p>

</div><div>
<h3>We need some help, but you'll have some great music</h3>
<p>To release Fifty we need to raise at least 3.000 Euros. This goes for:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">copyright fees</span></li>
<li><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">fundraising</span></li>
<li>release costs</li>
<li>sheet music publishing </li>
</ul>
<p>For just a couple of bugs you can have excellent collection of contemporary piano music.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What happens when you contribute?</h3>
<p>Remember, if you buy your copy of Fifty or contribute to the release, you're supporting a young composer at the outset of his / her professional life who will receive a commission to compose a new piece as a kick-starter of his career.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What if you can't buy or contribute to Fifty?</h3>
<p>Share it! E-mail it to your friends, your music teacher or your cousin who plays piano. Or just have a look at our projects at <a href=""http://www.in-music.sk"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.in-music.sk</a>.</p>

We need some help, but you'll have some great music
To release Fifty we need to raise at least 3.000 Euros. This goes for:

copyright fees
fundraising
release costs
sheet music publishing 

For just a couple of bugs you can have excellent collection of contemporary piano music.

What happens when you contribute?
Remember, if you buy your copy of Fifty or contribute to the release, you're supporting a young composer at the outset of his / her professional life who will receive a commission to compose a new piece as a kick-starter of his career.

What if you can't buy or contribute to Fifty?
Share it! E-mail it to your friends, your music teacher or your cousin who plays piano. Or just have a look at our projects at www.in-music.sk.
We are full of thanks.
Guys from InMusic, Slovakia.

<h3>My Story</h3>
</div><div>
<p>Hi! My name is Alex, I’m from Milan - Italy -  and I’m an independent electro pop singer and songwriter. I ‘ve start dancing when I was 6 and at 15 I’ve start to record my first songs. Thanks to internet activity and youtube videos, I’ve took part in some tv shows and reality shows that help my music to grow up. However, I refuse contract with big labels  and try to do everything by myself. It’s really hard to do it, but I just wanna express my self as better  and be honest with people who choose to follow me and my music ! I’ve made many videoclips, many tour around Italy and from two year I’m touring around Europe (live in London , Copenhagen, Duisseldorf, Munich, Barcelona, Warsaw, Wien expecially in LGBT pride events).</p>
<p> In 2015 , after few singles, I’ve realize my first studio album “Uncensored”.  In this LP I’ve work with many different people all over the Europe, Like Jandy Prudnikov (Ukraine), Tim Bergholm  (Sweeden) and italian producer  like Luca Sala. They helped me to make beats and arrangement for my own songs, I’ve wrote the lyrics (it’s so important to me write about what I live and what goes around in my life) and the album came alive.</p>
<p>You can search my name on Google and see how music takes  100% of my life. I plan  everything  by myself, every tour I made, every show I create, every videoclip or interview/tv show. I take also care about social media, website, and any kind of promotion. Tenacy and determination helped me to go on, without any manager or press agency. Just picking up the phone and finding  ways to promote my songs. Now I think it’s time to ask for a helping hand: I’m going to release my second studio album and I would like to grow up and take my music to an higher level and spread this new songs  around, more than what I’ve done until now. But this won’t be possible without your help… so let’s do it together !</p>

<h3>My Campaign</h3>
<p>I’ve plane a crowdfunding for the first time because I’m going to release my second studio album, there are many expenses to afford and I really need your help. This will be not just my new album, but OUR album and we can make it together! I would like to release the first preview single in October, related videoclip in November and , thanks to your important contribute, all the entire album in January 2018. It will be a fresh electro pop album , with some ballads and some up tempo hits! Many people are working on the project, from many different countries from Sweden to Ucraine and, of couse Italy. To create an album of songs of high quality, studio time costs add up quickly. This campaign can give us a unique opportunity to collaborate and make great art together. Your donation will cover following costs of my project:</p>
<p><strong>Pre production :</strong> all songs are written by me, but I have to make arrangement and this task is expensive. Quality usually cost, but with your help I can bring many composer from many different countries and put together many different ideas and sounds.</p>
<p><strong>Recording session/mixing and mastering: </strong>here is where all my lyrics and music become one thing and songs comes alive. Recording session and mastering ask for a sound engineer and for many hour of work.</p>
<p><strong>Videoclip productions:</strong> it’s one of the most important part of production. The videoclip is the image, the face of the single and it give you the possibility to reach more people than ever. My videoclips usually ask for many people including staff, technicians, dancers and director. And of course a Location where to record it. The result will be an HQ video inspired to the biggest popstars!</p>
<p><strong>Promotion costs:</strong> Sometimes you can do the best album ever, but without a good advertising campaign , it will not be listened to people. This Crowdfunding will help me to reach a  lot’s of new fans all over the world and make Our project knowed everywhere !</p>

It's both exhilarating and frustrating but unbelievably rewarding. You can have a blank canvas and throw all kinds of colors on it and there are so many rules to be broken!</p>
<p>I have been a performer alI my life. From my beginnings as a child actor in a series called <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghostwriter_(TV_series)"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Ghostwriter on PBS</a> to performing all over the world as a singer/percussionist with the <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/pimpsofjoytime/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Pimps of Joytime.</a></p>
<p>After touring for years supporting other musicians' visions, I'm ready to share some new sounds that me and my buddy, David Bailis, have concocted! He is an incredible guitar and bass player and writer/arranger, if ya don't know! He's also one of the most driven, disciplined, positive people I know. After meeting in 2007 at the amazing scene of Rose Live music in Brooklyn, Dave and I started playing together in the Pimps of Joytime (PJT). Performing together with the PJT and countless other projects that we’ve been a part of has given us the opportunity to build our musical foundation and trust.</p>
<p>Earlier this year that I finally got up the nerve to share some demos with Dave. We worked hard to build those demos into more developed songs and when we began performing this music live, the connection we made with the audience was inspiring. That led us to start this original music project, <strong><a href=""https://www.facebook.com/WalkTalkBand/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Walk Talk</a>.</strong></p>
<p>Your support will help us make the album that we know we can deliver. We are blessed to have such a great community around us and we need your help to make this a successful record and also a full-on love crusade! Music heals. It uplifts us in dark times and emphasizes the good moments. Join us as we launch our mission!  <strong>&lt;3</strong> </p>

After meeting in 2007 at the amazing scene of Rose Live music in Brooklyn, Dave and I started playing together in the Pimps of Joytime (PJT). Performing together with the PJT and countless other projects that we’ve been a part of has given us the opportunity to build our musical foundation and trust.
Earlier this year that I finally got up the nerve to share some demos with Dave. We worked hard to build those demos into more developed songs and when we began performing this music live, the connection we made with the audience was inspiring. That led us to start this original music project, Walk Talk.
Your support will help us make the album that we know we can deliver. We are blessed to have such a great community around us and we need your help to make this a successful record and also a full-on love crusade! Music heals. It uplifts us in dark times and emphasizes the good moments. Join us as we launch our mission!  <3

<h3>My Background</h3>
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>The name's Timothy Ferguson. My story began in the small town of Nashville, Ga. I'm the son of a pastor, musician, and teaching father, and a loving teaching mother. Music has been apart of my life sense I can remember. At the age of three a started playing drums and eventually would pick up saxophone and piano. My love for creating music would progress into something major. My father instilled in me a love for God and for humanity, and the belief that I can do anything I set my mind too. I want to share the gifts that God gave and my father cultivated with the world.</p>
<p>This project means a great deal because it's music that represents my life. It represents my thoughts expressed through music, my passion, my pain, my personality, my creativity, and my goals. It's also a springboard into mentorship and further creative endeavors.

Hello,
The name's Timothy Ferguson. My story began in the small town of Nashville, Ga. I'm the son of a pastor, musician, and teaching father, and a loving teaching mother. Music has been apart of my life sense I can remember. At the age of three a started playing drums and eventually would pick up saxophone and piano. My love for creating music would progress into something major. My father instilled in me a love for God and for humanity, and the belief that I can do anything I set my mind too. I want to share the gifts that God gave and my father cultivated with the world.
This project means a great deal because it's music that represents my life. It represents my thoughts expressed through music, my passion, my pain, my personality, my creativity, and my goals. It's also a springboard into mentorship and further creative endeavors. These endeavors include public speaking, the creation of a production company called HOA, and an arts school that tailors curriculum to the student and cultivates creativity, morality, and spirituality. 
.No goal is out of reach. especially when done in the context of community. This is why I need your help. To reach a goal that will span the lifetimes of our children's children and beyond. My goals are lofty but God given. That being said I know that it will happen. We're stronger together and I need your help.
So far I've established my self as a saxophonist and am at the threshold of finishing my B.A. degree in music. I've played with Grammy winning artist and opened for big names in the blues(Bobby Rush) and R&B(Betty Wright) world.  I've decided that it is time to take my career to a different level.

<h3> WHO IS THELONIOUS MONK?</h3>
<p>Thelonious Sphere Monk (what a name!) was born October 10, 1917, in Rocky Mount, North Carolina, and died February 17, 1982 in Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey. He is the second-most recorded composer in the history of jazz, after Duke Ellington—an achievement that becomes more remarkable when you know that Ellington wrote or cowrote about 1000 compositions, while Monk is only credited with 70. </p>
<p>But what compositions they are! The more popular ones are ""'Round Midnight"", ""Straight, No Chaser"", ""Blue Monk"", ""Ruby, My Dear"", ""In Walked Bud"", and ""Well, You Needn't"". Monk was equally admired for his compositions and his playing style. Monk's playing was rooted in the tradition of stride piano, but he was also a key figure in the bop revolution, and his style contains elements of both. His compositions were derived from his piano stylings, which had surprising syncopations and combinations of notes that some new listeners assumed were mistakes, until they heard enough of them to realize the method behind his madness. His music was playful but also challenging.  He remained a best-kept secret in American jazz throughout the first half of his career, inspiring contemporaries—some of whom treated him as a mentor—but never quite breaking through to a wider audience. </p>
<p>This changed for Monk starting in the mid-1950s. The first thing that happened was that Monk got a new manager, Harry Columby, a schoolteacher who recognized his genius. Columby was instrumental in getting Monk a contract with Riverside Records after a long spell with Prestige, which didn't know how to sell him; Riverside believed in Monk so strongly that they bought out his contract with his old label. Columby also helped Monk get his cabaret card back so that he could play in clubs again. Monk had lost his cabaret card in a heroin bust; the heroin belonged to Monk's colleague, Bud Powell, but Monk took the rap because he didn't want to rat on his friend. </p>
<p>Monk's first gig after getting his cabaret card back was at the Five Spot, with a gifted young saxophonist named John Coltrane. His career picked up: he put out three albums on Riverside that year—<i>Brilliant Corners</i>, <i>Monk's Music </i>and <i>Thelonious Himself</i>—and started to become a jazz celebrity, to the extent that such a thing existed in a postwar United States infatuated with rock 'n' roll. Monk's career had his ups and downs after that, but professionally it was mostly up. He was productive as both a composer and live performer. In 1962, he was featured on the cover of <i>Time</i> Magazine, one of a handful of American jazz players to be so honored.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Monk's health started deteriorating in the late 1960s. It had never been all that good: he had suffered throughout his life from what his family later described as mental illness, though doctors never figured out what kind. He would spin in circles, fidget endlessly. There were times when he'd take off and go wandering around for days. He was hospitalized many times. Doctors prescribed electroshock treatment, but his wife Nellie wouldn't allow it. He took lithium and antipsychotics. It has been speculated that incorrect prescriptions damaged Monk's brain further, but this has never been proven.  Monk's live performing tapered off in the late 1970s. He died in 1982 at the home of his most devoted patron, Baroness Pannonica de Koenigswarter, who also supported Charlie Parker.  </p>
<p>Monk's work lives on for its boldness, originality, meticulous construction, and endless sense of play. ""The clarity and logic of his work might have been compared with the craft of an architect,"" wrote Mimi Clare of <i>The Los Angeles Times</i>, ""each phrase, each fragment, each plump chord had its exact place in his musical structure."" </p>

<p><strong>“The Piano Ain’t Got No Wrong Notes!” – Thelonious Monk</strong></p>
<p>I was 17 when I was first introduced to Monk’s music by two friends from Columbus, OH. They loaned me LPs of <i>Monk’s Music</i> and <i>Art Blakey’s Jazz Messengers with Thelonious Monk</i>, which I taped and gave back to them. At first I was intrigued; I’d read about Monk before. But once I began listening I was hooked! A month or two later I taught myself to play “Blue Monk,” complete with Monk’s piano solo on the Blakey/Messengers record. </p>
<p>A few years later while I was in the Army at Ft. Jackson, SC I played a few times with the great saxophonist Lew Tabackin. We played nothing but Monk and Coltrane songs. About the same time I read in Downbeat about a group with Steve Lacy on soprano sax and Roswell Rudd on trombone. They played nothing but Monk songs! For me, at that time, that was too hip—and the seed was planted! </p>
<p>As the years went by I learned more of Monk’s music and wrote arrangements of it. We even played a few Monk songs while I was touring with Al Hirt (at his request!). When I was writing charts of Monk songs, bits and pieces of me began to seep into what I was writing. A few live gigs happened where we could actually play this music. Over the last three decades, I've put out five albums of my own material on CD (you can view a complete list <a href=""http://www.cduniverse.com/search/xx/music/label/dpz+JAZZ/a/dpz+JAZZ"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here</a>) </p>
<p>Then, in 2009, we formed the group Evidence and managed to some get club gigs and a few concerts in Dallas and Ft. Worth. Finally, in 2012, we recorded a CD’s worth of material. Then, when our original saxophonist Pete Gallio suddenly moved to Seattle, Woody Berner and I decided to form another Evidence group and record more music.</p>
<p>A series of medical issues (specifically three strokes) held me back. But when we learned of Monk’s upcoming 100th birthday (October 10, 1917) we decided to hurry and finish the project and issue the project in three different formats: as a download, a double CD, and as a set of three vinyl records. We're also making the album cover, featuring a painting by Junko Otsu and design by Peter Howell of London-based Howell Creative, as a t-shirt, a poster, and a set of coasters (which will allow you to have a drink with Monk, as it were). </p>
<p>My son Matt Zoller Seitz, TV critic for <i>New York</i> magazine and editor-in-chief of Roger Ebert.com, is also contributing perks to the fundraising campaign, in the form of signed copies of his books: <i>The Wes Anderson Collection</i>, <i>The Wes Anderson Collection: Grand Budapest Hotel</i>, <i>TV (The Book)</i>, <i>The Oliver Stone Experience</i>, and <i>Mad Men Carousel</i>.</p>
<p><i>Evidence </i>is the culmination of nearly six decades of listening, studying, performing and loving the works of a great American pianist and composer. We hope you enjoy it. —<i>Dave Zoller</i></p>

<h3><font>Making <i>Evidence</i></font></h3>
<p>Recording <i>Evidence</i> took a total of five days spread out over five years, in 2012 and 2017 (as mentioned earlier, a series of strokes got in the way of finishing it the first time around!). The cost of studio time, all told, was $3500. My sidemen deferred their payments because they're friends, but of course it's good karma to pay the band. $2400 is what it would've cost to hire these guys if they didn't know me.</p>
<p>Now that <i>Evidence</i> is finished and properly mastered, we want to print 500 double-CDs with gatefold cardboard sleeves ($1500), plus 200 copies of the vinyl triple-album ($4200, including the cost of printing a gatefold cover and record labels and paying for sleeves).</p>
<p>The total cost of licensing Monk's music in all formats, including CD, vinyl and downloads, comes to $3300. That's a big piece of the total, but also necessary because we want Monk's estate to be compensated: it's his music.  </p>
<p>Design of the cover and other items that showcase it (including t-shirts, the poster and the coasters) cost $1000. We also hired a researcher to create a list of jazz radio stations, web sites, jazz critics and aficionados all over the world, then contact them to try to stimulate interest in listening to <i>Evidence</i> when it comes out. Total hourly cost of this effort was $800.</p>
<p>All put together, to create <i>Evidence, </i>make it available in different formats and promote it will cost $15,700.  </p>
<h2><strong>What Do I Get Out of This?</strong></h2>
<p>Glad you asked! Bare minimum ($20), you get an official download of <i>Evidence </i>and a thank you from me. Moving up incrementally, you might get a copy of the double-CD ($25) or the vinyl three-record set ($75). </p>
<p>If you're not a jazz fan, but want to support this quest, you could choose one of the perks that features the album cover: a set of coasters ($25), or a poster version ($50). Or you can order one of Matt Zoller Seitz's books, signed by the author.</p>
<p>We also offer various levels of support that include one, two, three or more of the items listed here (see ""Perks"" for details).</p>

</div><div>
<h2>What We're Up Against</h2>
<p>There was never a good time to decide to be a jazz musician. Even when jazz was at its peak as an art form and an object of intense public fascination, the percentage of music fans worldwide who were into it was never enormous.  It's harder to be a working jazz musician now than ever before, partly because public taste in music has shifted pretty decisively to other genres, but also because the infrastructure that used to give it some semblance of support has faded. Major cities that might've hosted a dozen jazz clubs in the 1950s or '60s might have three or four now, if that. The number of radio stations devoted to jazz, old or new, has shrunk. Newspapers and magazines used to cover jazz regularly, along with literature, film, TV, opera, painting and other art forms; a lot of these outlets even had critics on staff who concentrated on their own area of expertise, and filed stories regularly to tell the public what they should seek out or avoid.  </p>
<p>That's not the case anymore. A lot of times, the only way people hear about a notable new jazz record is if another fan tells them about it. It's become much more of a word-of-mouth thing, and while social media tools like Facebook and Twitter help somewhat, it's still an uphill battle to make something like this, then get the word out and let people know that it exists.</p>
<p>This is all a long way of saying that releasing an enormous collection of new arrangements of work by a jazz master who died in 1982, and who was never a household name to start with, is not what you'd call a sure thing. In fact, we have it on good authority that it's crazy and ridiculous to even think about doing something like this.</p>
<p>But hey! We're doing this for the love of it. And we want to share what we've done with the world—in a handsomely designed, professionally engineered format that can sit comfortably alongside works by past masters, because it was created in the same loving spirit.</p>
<p>We've thought about <i>Evidence</i> not just as a collection of recordings but as an object: something you can hold in your hands while reading the liner notes, admiring the artwork and graphics on the packaging, smelling the ink on the paper, maybe even holding the CD or vinyl record up and admiring the way light plays across its surface.</p>
<p>It's an old-school labor of love. </p>
<p>It's also a vote of encouragement for a musician who's been around for a while, and put everything he knows about music into a passion project. </p>
<p> </p>

If you're not a jazz fan, but want to support this quest, you could choose one of the perks that features the album cover: a set of coasters ($25), or a poster version ($50). Or you can order one of Matt Zoller Seitz's books, signed by the author.
We also offer various levels of support that include one, two, three or more of the items listed here (see ""Perks"" for details).
 

What We're Up Against
There was never a good time to decide to be a jazz musician. Even when jazz was at its peak as an art form and an object of intense public fascination, the percentage of music fans worldwide who were into it was never enormous.  It's harder to be a working jazz musician now than ever before, partly because public taste in music has shifted pretty decisively to other genres, but also because the infrastructure that used to give it some semblance of support has faded. Major cities that might've hosted a dozen jazz clubs in the 1950s or '60s might have three or four now, if that. The number of radio stations devoted to jazz, old or new, has shrunk. Newspapers and magazines used to cover jazz regularly, along with literature, film, TV, opera, painting and other art forms; a lot of these outlets even had critics on staff who concentrated on their own area of expertise, and filed stories regularly to tell the public what they should seek out or avoid.  
That's not the case anymore. A lot of times, the only way people hear about a notable new jazz record is if another fan tells them about it. It's become much more of a word-of-mouth thing, and while social media tools like Facebook and Twitter help somewhat, it's still an uphill battle to make something like this, then get the word out and let people know that it exists.
This is all a long way of saying that releasing an enormous collection of new arrangements of work by a jazz master who died in 1982, and who was never a household name to start with, is not what you'd call a sure thing. In fact, we have it on good authority that it's crazy and ridiculous to even think about doing something like this.
But hey! We're doing this for the love of it. And we want to share what we've done with the world—in a handsomely designed, professionally engineered format that can sit comfortably alongside works by past masters, because it was created in the same loving spirit.
We've thought about Evidence not just as a collection of recordings but as an object: something you can hold in your hands while reading the liner notes, admiring the artwork and graphics on the packaging, smelling the ink on the paper, maybe even holding the CD or vinyl record up and admiring the way light plays across its surface.
It's an old-school labor of love. 
It's also a vote of encouragement for a musician who's been around for a while, and put everything he knows about music into a passion project.",4.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<h3>Letter from Garrett:</h3>
<p>I don't really know how to fully explain what these songs mean to me, but at risk of sounding melodramatic, each track feels like a rest stop on the way from my family's recovery from grief and loss to a place of celebration and appreciation of what it means to love and be loved by each other.</p>
<p>Additionally, I’m excited that this album reflects on the significant roles a lot of you have had on that journey. I hope you find a piece of yourself in it, and I hope it let’s you know how much I've cherished our friendships and relationships. -GG</p>

<h3>What's needed to finish the album?</h3>
<p>Here's the breakdown:</p>
<p><strong>Recording</strong>: each song is about 50-60% done on average, with two songs and a transition yet to be recorded. $2465</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Editing</strong>: making the whole record cohesive together with all it's moving parts once we're done recording. $900</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Mixing</strong>: making it sound sonically pleasing and professional. $1,050</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Mastering</strong>: This is the final touch, the important step that makes it all sound full and radio ready. This is the only part of the album we can't do ourselves, thankfully it'll be in amazing hands with Emily Lazar (Noah And The Whale, Vampire Weekend, Sia, Etc.). $2700</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>The Album</strong>: $7,115</p>
<p>+</p>

<p><strong>The Total</strong>: <i>$7780</i></p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What's the album like so far? </h3>
<p>It's a sentimental blend of old world jazz elements and modern songwriting.</p>
<p>We've woven muted trumpets, large string arrangements, and warm piano over an anthemic indie-pop base, thankfully with the help of some incredible world-class musicians (whose performances I personally think make the album what it is). All of this is brought together by my amazing producer, Darren Rayl. I think might of had just as much fun hanging out with him as I have making the record.</p>
<p>The album so far:</p>

<p>The studio has the potential to shut down due to heavy construction while they widen on the road it's on. Seeing as that will take a while, the studio may shut down and move to another location, which would most likely be a smaller setup without our needed tracking capabilities.

To make this performance sound great, I would need a drummer, bassist, and lead guitarist. For some songs, I would also need background singers and a mandolin player. I have spent the last few weeks creating musical charts for my songs, but musicians should get paid for their practice!

The men’s shirts would cost $242 for 50 shirts while the women’s shirts would cost $432 for 50 shirts. Vistaprint would be able to turn around the order in about two weeks. I would also like to order 250 sticker decals which can purchased through Bands on a Budget. It would cost $210 for 250 sticker decals, and the turnaround rate is 9-12 days. If I order the T-Shirts and stickers at the same time, they should each arrive around mid April.Paying the Band - To accompany the release of my CD, I would like to hire a backing band and perform the album live from top to bottom. To make this performance sound great, I would need a drummer, bassist, and lead guitarist. For some songs, I would also need background singers and a mandolin player. I have spent the last few weeks creating musical charts for my songs, but musicians should get paid for their practice! I would like to raise $750 for 10 rehearsals, which could be distributed accordingly. At the end of rehearsing, the band and I could perform the CD release show and any additional paid gigs. Expenses:
Mastering - $60 to master 1 more song for CD

<p>Life has been quite a journey. After growing up surrounded by the beautiful Latvian country side, filled with wild days in the mesmerizing nature, I quickly realized, that everything I wish for in the life is connected with music. A bunch of songs and music projects later, after having great times in Jazz and cover bands, I started to perform my own music. Played shows in the bars, cafés and on folk festivals, and then eventually moved to Innsbruck. Here I work in die Bäckerei Kulturbackstube,  a local culture centre, where I organize concerts and open stage events for local musicians and artists. </p>
<h3>About the project:</h3>
<p>After releasing my debut album ''These Storms'' on 2017,  for the past few years I have been exploring electronic pop music and have gotten interested in music production. The result is a collection of 8 tracks, which I have either completely produced myself or produced together with the amazing local Austrian producer CHRS (Christoph Holzknecht). Big parts of the album are recorded at my home. I am extremely excited to bring out this record, as it goes in the musical direction, that is interesting and challenging for me at the moment. Moving away from the melancholic singer songwriter corner into the depths of electronic pop music. Move upbeat, more powerful, more experimental.</p>
<div> </div>
<div>My big dream was to be able to perform my solo program alone, showing also an inspiring example to other young ladies out there, who are missing the courage to get into music production and performance side of the music. It has been such an empowering journey and enormous joy to look back and to realize, that even though I started from a scratch, without any knowledge about music production, in these few years, although, the music production is a never-ending process and I am just at the very beginning, I have been able to create and also to perform completely on my own.</div>

<h3>What I need the financial support for:</h3>
<p>To release this album I still need a little bit of financial support to cover the final costs of the <strong>mixing and mastering</strong>, <strong>pressing of the CDs</strong>, <strong>to cover the costs for the cover art and promotional costs</strong>. In case there is some money left in the pot, it will be invested in a <strong>music video</strong>.</p>
<p>The album is already in the finish line and was originally planned to be released without a crowdfunding campaign. However, as many artists out there, the Corona times has hit me pretty hard &amp; I have decided to reach out to the community to cover the last costs of the production. Help me to bring this record into the day light!</p>
<h3>About the perks:</h3>
<p>To be able to focus more on the music, for this campaign, I decided to keep the perks rather simple:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can purchase a digital download of my album</li>
<li>You can purchase a CD</li>
<li>You can buy a ticket to a supporter concert in Innsbruck, Austria, where I will perform my solo electro set and share the stage with wonderful artists from my community</li>
<li>You can order a song written specially for you. This is also a wonderful original gift for a friend</li>
<li>You can order a house concert. This one I can only carry out in Tirol. Having a birthday? Just want to have a cool summer garden concert? This one is for you then. I really love performing, btw.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help:</h3>
<p>I know, that many people of my community are having the same financial struggles, so I am kindly asking for contributions just from the people who can afford and wish to support me. There are also some other ways, how you can always support me, even if in your wallet is the same empty as mine:</p>
<ul>
<li>Share the campaign with your friends and community. Maybe I have some hidden fans there!</li>
<li>Come to my concerts, I am always happy to have a beer after the show as well</li>

Help me to bring this record into the day light!
About the perks:
To be able to focus more on the music, for this campaign, I decided to keep the perks rather simple:

You can purchase a digital download of my album
You can purchase a CD
You can buy a ticket to a supporter concert in Innsbruck, Austria, where I will perform my solo electro set and share the stage with wonderful artists from my community
You can order a song written specially for you. This is also a wonderful original gift for a friend
You can order a house concert. This one I can only carry out in Tirol. Having a birthday? Just want to have a cool summer garden concert? This one is for you then. I really love performing, btw.


Other Ways You Can Help:
I know, that many people of my community are having the same financial struggles, so I am kindly asking for contributions just from the people who can afford and wish to support me. There are also some other ways, how you can always support me, even if in your wallet is the same empty as mine:

Share the campaign with your friends and community. Maybe I have some hidden fans there!
Come to my concerts, I am always happy to have a beer after the show as well
Follow me on the social media & share it with your friends:

<h3>What is <i>The American Mythology</i>?</h3>
<p>The same Donnie who brought us the timeless classic, The Colored Section, returns. Delivering a herculean fanfare of sonic proportions – his highly anticipated album, <i>The American Mythology</i>. It’s soul music like you’ve never experienced it before.</p>
<p><i>The American Mythology</i> unveils an epic musical narrative inspired by the structural archetype of the classic myth. The epic narrative begins with ""The Book of Oblivion”, a sacred scripture beheld by a cult of faithful followers. Conducting their worship in a temple made of radio waves known as ""The Invisible Institution”, a building not made by hand. </p>
<p>Their sacred scripture tells the story of the American experience. Through the use of musical metaphor and artistic allegory as modes of expression, these “scriptures"" craft an unforgettable story. Rich in meaning, yet woven together with childlike simplicity. </p>
<p>Donnie's music has always spoken to the hearts of people and the truths of time. However, critics praise, <i>The American Mythology</i> as a symbolic masterpiece, the most powerful Donnie yet.</p>
<p>Become a part of this beautifully written cult classic and experience your place within the story of <i>The American Mythology</i>. This, this is for you America.  </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Healing, hope, perspective and freedom are just a few of the deeply rooted themes in the new epic musical narrative <i>The American Mythology</i>.  </p>
<p>Donnie initially started this project as a therapeutic and artistic means of expression to break free of the bondage of certain religion. Recognizing that while he himself was seeking to heal, many others were seeking the same freedom. </p>
<p>Donnie notes, ""Our parents teach us what they believe because it’s what they know. However, more often than not, that doesn't always agree with our personal purpose and calling. I’ve found this to be especially true as an artist.""</p>
<p>In the musical narrative, a lively ensemble invites the listener to step into a personally individualized place that openly practices the power of religious freedom. It is a celebration of healing and rediscovery through song. Centered around the archetype of the classic myth, Donnie takes the listener on a soulful journey of epic musical proportions. His artistic dialogue encourages the listener to abandon all societal expectation.  In turn, asking the people of America to be ""born again”, taking on a new perspective of America. </p>
<p>The singers on the project are Llewon Felder, Rahbi Hines, Heston Francis and Rolynne Anderson. They not only bring the characters to life, but an array color to the story. </p>
<p>Although monies are needed to make this vision a reality, part of your financial gift will be donated to breast cancer awareness. Join Donnie and help to bring this project to life!</p>
</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>There are many challenges that arise during any project, but those that we can foresee are:</p>
<p>1. Having the ability to finish compiling, mixing, and mastering the musical portion of the project</p>
<p>2.  Having the capital to craft an equally stunning and visually compelling theatrical stage experience.</p>
<p>3. Completing the project by the end of 2020.  </p>
<p>Although we are working diligently to put the right people and supplementary support in place to see the project through on a smaller scale, we would lengthen the timeline by another year or two, in order to bring the project to fruition.</p>
<p>There is an immediate need to pay the following:  Live recording artists, voice actors, musicians, producers, recording and sound engineers/designers, writers, audio mixing, mastering, distribution, marketing, management, production, filming, and all live event production costs related to the project.</p>
<p>We have solid milestone goals to get us there in either situation, but the quickest route there is with your support. We are excited to partner with you to bring this project to life. Not only for the people of Atlanta but the people of America.  Atlanta is simply where the journey begins.</p>

<h3>Hi, and welcome to my Indiegogo Campaign!</h3>
<p>My name is Elliott Novak. I'm a songwriter currently living in San Francisco. </p>
<p>The one thing that has been consistent about my life is songwriting. I've slept on the floor's of homeless shelters and worked for an investment bank. I spent nearly five years working for a project management firm that oversaw the green refurbishment of half a dozen historical properties in the SF Bay Area - a very rewarding job! Then, like a nightmare, I lost everything and spent a year in physical therapy learning to walk again (I did it!)...   Through all of it, I've never given up because I've always written songs.</p>
<p>I'm here to raise funds to record and promote a two-track single (single +B-side).<strong> </strong>My goal is to get my name out there as a serious presence in the songwriting community. I know I can do it! As seen above from my history, anything is possible. The song above, (A DIFFERENT SONG) is an example of the kinds of songs I write. Emotional, piano driven songs that resonate with the listener's heart. (Working with Chloé from StudioPros on A DIFFERENT SONG made it all that more powerful. She and I have forged a magical connection.) If you like what you hear, please contribute. The songs I want to release are the best work of my life.</p>
<p>Sometimes it seems as if the songs come from somewhere else and I just happen to be at the piano when they're ready to reveal themselves. Sounds crazy, but it's true.</p>
<p>Obviously, if successful, and I can get my music heard, this has the potential to change my life. Since the health problems that nearly ruined me, I've been living like a pauper. A life change will be very welcome. The best thing about helping someone change their life is they (me) turn around and help change someone else's life. </p>
<p>I'm seeking $3500 (USD) to record two songs, each with a budget of $1200. The remaining $1100 will be for a promotional package that gets me a press release into several of the high-end music blogs, a sponsored post, and my single will be placed in the new music playlists. If I don't reach my $3500 goal, any funds received will still be used toward this project. I will find a way and will make sure my contributors know what I'm doing every step of the way.</p>

<h3>What on Earth are We Doing?</h3>
<p>After 17 years together in various formations, Tyra Penn and Her Army of Snakes are recording their first album! As a band with such a long lifespan, many, many outstanding New England jazz musicians have been among our intrepid reptiles. Joining me on the record will be an A-list ensemble, who happen to be some of my favorite people: Paul Courchaine on guitar, my musical partner for the entire 17 years; Molly Flannery on piano, who has been the primary arranger for many of the songs, and whose composition Undercurrent will be featured on the record; Russ Gershon on saxes and woodwinds, another long-time collaborator who has also been one of the arrangers; Joe Potenza and Sven Larson switching off on the bass chair; and Zeke Martin on drums. </p>
<ul></ul>

<h3>How You Can Help, and How We Will Thank You</h3>
<p>Our project cost estimate is about $14,000. One studio day is completed and paid for, with two more recording dates coming up in September. The studio sessions and the band I am paying for out of pocket, to the tune of about $5500. What I could use your help with are the following costs:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mechanical licenses for up to 18 songs  $1800</li>
<li>Mixing &amp; mastering $2700</li>
<li>Manufacturing of CDs (I know, but hard copies are still a thing) $3700</li>
<li><strong>Total request: $8200</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Aside from the warm glow you will inevitably feel when you become a part of our project, you will of course also be directly rewarded for your generosity. Depending on the level at which you give, we will send you a shiny new disc in an artfully designed package; maybe a copy of the novel on which the record is based; maybe a piece of custom art jewelry based on one of the songs or a passage from the novel; or, for the most magnanimous among you, a one-of-a-kind piece of assemblage art illustrating a part of the story. You can find the full description of the ""perks"" on the sidebar, and always choose your path wisely!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What Your Contribution Means To Me</h3>
<p>If you know me at all, you know that I am not sentimental; but, this project is something I have been percolating for the band for a few years now, and I find myself really driven to get it done. I love the guys in this band, and the music we make. This is the first time I have found myself in a position to be realistically able to pursue capturing this evidence of our existence, after several false starts over the years.</p>
<p>The novel that it is based on, John Crowley's ""Little, Big"" has been the most influential book on my life since I was 13 years old (!!!). It is a wondrous story, and I have spent the last couple of years refining the program of songs that maps to its plot. I have barged in on the author's life and he seems suitably amused by this collage of bits of his text into the songs. I've also been sharing with him my progress on the shadowbox assemblages that accompany the show when we perform it live.</p>
<p>I'm like most people, I would prefer to be able to do this whole thing on my own without coming to you to chip in; but, realistically I know I can only fund a third to a half of the full project. So here I am, asking you to contribute.</p>
<p>Also, I am not above shamelessly pointing out that in August of 2020 I will be celebrating my (50th!) birthday, so this would be the best possible birthday present. As I said before, the title of the record is also The Last Day of August, and on 31 August this campaign will close. Your contribution to this project will make this the best birthday ever!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you aren't in a position to give, or if you can't give as much as you would like because this has been such a weird and stressful year, you can still help out by sharing this campaign with all of your networks. Be a mensch!</p>
</div><p>And that's all there is to it.</p></div>","What on Earth are We Doing?
After 17 years together in various formations, Tyra Penn and Her Army of Snakes are recording their first album! As a band with such a long lifespan, many, many outstanding New England jazz musicians have been among our intrepid reptiles. Joining me on the record will be an A-list ensemble, who happen to be some of my favorite people: Paul Courchaine on guitar, my musical partner for the entire 17 years; Molly Flannery on piano, who has been the primary arranger for many of the songs, and whose composition Undercurrent will be featured on the record; Russ Gershon on saxes and woodwinds, another long-time collaborator who has also been one of the arrangers; Joe Potenza and Sven Larson switching off on the bass chair; and Zeke Martin on drums. 

The title of our record is The Last Day of August, a special story, told in song, based on an uncommonly beautiful novel. John Crowley’s ""Little, Big"" is a modern-day fairy tale following   five generations of the Drinkwater family in their curiously constructed house, located Somewhere in rural New England.John Crowley once said of his work that his books are made, in part, of other books.

<h3>La Sposa del Gufo </h3>
<p>My name is Luisa Russo, I am an Italian singer and songwriter based in Egypt. I am also a blogger, Italian teacher and Hatha yoga instructor. I love dancing, especially contemporary dance and traditional Italian folk dance, which I perform with one of my bands (Estabena, the Mediterranean Music Project) blended in a fusion of flamenco and oriental dance. I have a passion for music instruments: I am trying to learn to play guitar, ukulele and 'oud. In my spare time I like to doodle and color, my favorite meditation is travelling, especially walking.</p>
<p>I have been performing most of my life with cover bands, until one day I decided that I wanted to express myself on a deeper level of content and not only form. That's how I started preparing my playlist of originalss to be performed with my dear friend Philippe Humbert (clarinetist). We didn't perform a lot, because of Covid19 restrictions, but I didn't give up and I decided that this is the right moment for recording some of my songs. When I think about my songs I consider them as my babies, my creatures that I want to deliver, recording them would be not only the realization of a dream, but also a ""tangible"" evidence of my artistic activity, an ""art delivery"". </p>
<p>La Sposa del Gufo is a collection of six of my original songs. The songs I picked for this first EP are emblematic of the different stages of my life journey in Cairo, where I have been living during the past 5 years. I only recently moved to Dahab on the Red Sea, where I got the opportunity to re-observe these past years from another perspective and finally started to record these songs. </p>
<p>When my ""babies"" will be delivered I want them to be loved and shared with all my friends (and non-friends) and family, what a better tool than a crowdfunding for making it a shared outcome and to reach a wide network of possible audience? </p>
<p><span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">The more I go deeper in my yoga journey, the artistic and also the ""simple"" life journey, the more I dive in the importance of sharing. I want to share my art, my journey, my thoughts and my sound.</span></p>

<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The amount I am trying to collect is of 1850 €  it's the budget needed to cover what follow: </p>
<ul>
<li>Recording and producing (900 €)</li>
<li>Artwork and cover design (100 €)</li>
<li>Reimbursement of expenses for musicians (Philippe, the clarinetist, agreed to be reimbursed by receiving 6 lessons of Italian; Maya, the viola player, didn't ask for a specific amount for the two tracks in which she joined me, but I plan to reimburse her according to your generosity, please be generous her job deserves to be recognized and Tigana, the percussionist, accepted to join in three songs for the symbolic amount of 50 €) </li>
<li>Video of the song Bar20s (400 € plus budget per make up, clothes and various)</li>
<li>Art work (printing and delivery) to be defined according to demand.</li>
<li>Copyrights (around 300 €)  </li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>I elaborated a series of tasty perks that combine all my different skills from Yoga to doodling. Check them all!</li>
<li>Priority of funds will go to reimburse the musicians and on the recording and producing.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<ul>
<li>I think my project is an interesting outcome of 5 years of cultural mediation and exploring of Cairo life and culture. It's an experience on mixing two languages that I find extremely beautiful and poetic and therefore I deeply love: Arabic and Italian. </li>
<li>I successfully run a crowdfunding campaign here on Indiegogo in 2018 which lead to the release of Moga, Estabena first cover album (available on Soundcloud: <a href=""https://soundcloud.com/user-125696263/sets/moga"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://soundcloud.com/user-125696263/sets/moga</a>).</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Time for crowdfunding campaign is really limited, I really want to release the album for my 30th birthday, which will be in October. Delivering some of the perks (from Egypt) abroad might be challenging, but I can overcome this issues waiting to deliver them from Italy, where I will be hopefully for my birthday.</p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>There is not only one way of sharing your abundance! If you can not donate right now, you can always support me, liking my social media pages. It's always good to join forces: you can offer your artistic skills (video making, marketing, make up, clothes for visual materials, visibility). And of course you can talk about my campaign to all your friends and share it on all your social media. Use the Indiegogo share tools!</p>
<p>I already want to thank deeply: Mohammad Gamal (Jimmy) for the animation, video editing and mockups of the merchandising, Eleonora Iannotta for offering me to work with her amazing and professional company (IICI) to shoot the video of one of the songs (Bar20s) and to join Salma Safaa in providing the styling and make up for it and all their love and support.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hello everybody, my name is Brandon Laxton and I am a singer songwriter from Southern West Virginia. Growing up music was always a big part of my life, and I was always surrounded by talented singers and musicians. So, one day I decided to pick up a guitar and start learning to play all the songs that I loved growing up. After playing other artist's music for a couple of years I decided to try my hand at writing of my own music and original songs. I went from playing on front porches, to getting paid gigs around the Morgantown area and in Greenbrier county. Unfortunately the current pandemic has put a stop to the all gigs that were previously helping me to fund my album project. Working part time and going to college really makes it hard for me to save up money to accomplish this goal, so that is why I am asking for your assistance in this project.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p> The production of an album is going to be around $5000. This money will go to all of the elements of music production such as Tracking, Editing, Mixing, Mastering, and the price of getting different musicians to accomplish the sound that I feel will best represent my music. All funds will go into the production of the album and with that being said If we do not reach the goal then I will use the funds to release singles until I save up enough money to produce the full album. Check out the perks section to see what is in it for you!!</p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Music is something that brings people together, it is the one true universal language. Music can make you feel better on a bad day or be the soundtrack to a good night hanging with friends. I believe in the music and songs I have created. I have poured my own personal experiences and feelings into the songs I have written and would love to be able to share that with others. I have never personally released music on a professional level but have played my songs for family and friends with positive reactions. I am a believer that a good song can make the world a little bit brighter of a place, which is something we can all use right about now.</p>
<div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The music industry and a career in music are often thought of as an ""impossible"" hurdle to jump. I am aware that while there is truth in this statement, you have to start somewhere if you believe in your own dreams. My dreams are not to be the next country superstar, my dreams are to produce music that others enjoy and I enjoy making in the process. I am taking the first step to make my dreams come true and if I can make this album a success then I have already succeeded the beginning of my goal. The largest challenge I am facing right now is a financial one, and that is why I am asking for your help. I don't know much about how hard it is to succeed in the music industry but what I do know is, as a small town West Virginian I believe in myself, and I believe that my music will be something everyone will enjoy. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Times are hard right now and I know that financial help is not something everyone will be able to give. That being said, another way you can help me is to share my posts, come out to gigs (when we can gave them again) , and tell others about both my campaign and my music. I don't want to become an overnight success, I want to earn it. That all starts with the help of you. Thank you so much and God Bless. </p>

<p><i>I'm starting this campaign to record my first produced album and videos.  My goal is to bring my music to a nation-wide audience.</i></p>

<p>Communist Daughter has spanned a decade.  We’ve lived through 10 years of tours, playing shows with Jason Isbell to Billie Eillish, Temples to Sturgill Simpson.  Now we are reaching out all the way from the Arctic Circle, with our latest album ""Unknown Caller.""  The only way we can continue to make music from so far north is with your direct support.</p>
<p>Our latest journey to the edge of the world took us off the road just as we garnered our most national acclaim. Johnny and Molly bowed out of the relentless touring schedule and moved first to San Diego to care for aging family, and then to their new home above the Arctic Circle.  Now making their home in a remote village in the Alaskan tundra they’re reaching out with Communist Daughter once more, to fans across the world. Just as the first album was born out of a “goodbye” to a life lived with drugs and deteriorating mental health, their latest album comes full circle as they once again say goodbye.  This time Johnny walks away from touring and the industry model, again for mental health and a shot at a new musical life.</p>
<p>And just like the first time, Communist Daughter chooses to say goodbye in song. They return to the things that made them break out artists in 2010, private songs that speak to letting go and moving on, and a bittersweet longing for the life they couldn’t live anymore.  ""Unknown Caller"" is the bookend to their 2010 debut ""Soundtrack to the End."" The new Communist Daughter album takes their songs out of the basement recordings where it all started, to fully orchestrated productions featuring strings from  the Laurel String Quartet (Father John Misty, Dessa,) &amp; Andy Thompson (Belle &amp; Sebastian, Jeremy Messersmith) as well as horn arrangements from Stephen Chen (San Fermin.)  Once again they collaborated with Kevin Bowe (Replacements, Porcupine) while remembering where they started by pulling tracks from the intimate recording sessions in Johnny &amp; Molly's own bedroom.</p>
<p>It's true, the magic of the internet gives us unlimited music and unprecedented access to artists, all it requires is for musicians to appear live on stage night after night to fund their art.  Unfortunately, some musicians have to choose between their mental health and their musical career. So here we are, after turning down labels and tours at the height of our career, we send you a direct love letter, and ask for you to be a part of making Communist Daughter stretch into a new decade.  With your help, we can give you our third album “Unknown Caller,” on our 10th anniversary. - CD </p> <h2><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></h2>
<p>Let’s get transparent.  Putting out an album takes quite a bit of seed money, even at a very scaled back level.  We’ve put together a basic budget, with two funding tracks, one on the national stage, and one at a much more private level, that show you exactly where the money will go:</p>
<p><strong>Fixed costs:</strong></p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">$8,500 : Remaining recording costs paying studios and producers and engineers</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">$3,500 : Vinyl Manufacturing cost (Noiseland Industries)</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">$1000 : Tshirt / merchandise production cost (Fledgling Press design, Afternoon Printing)</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">$500 : Shipping costs (material/postage) for backers </p>

</ul>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">$4000 : Video production (2-3 videos created at bare minimum costs…)</p>
<p><strong>-------</strong></p>
<p>20% of total for operating costs (platform fees, management and legal costs, licensing costs) </p> <p><strong>Total = $28,000</strong></p>
<p><br/><strong>-------</strong></p>
<p><strong>Track 2 -</strong></p>
<p><strong>Our Initial Goal = $10,000</strong></p> <p>At $10,000 we can pay:</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">$4,000 - almost ½ the recording cost invoices</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">$3500 - Vinyl Manufacturing cost</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">$1000 - Merchandise manufacturing cost</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">$500 - Shipping costs for all backer orders</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">$500 - FB/Insta Ad cost for promotion of Indiegogo campaing</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">$500 - 5% Indiegogo platform fee </p>
<p>Any music videos, PR, and management/legal fees will be paid after we reach the first 10k funding goal or paid out of our pockets.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>What You Get</h3>
<p>This is a very limited release. This LP will only be physically released on a colored short run Vinyl. People always ask if we will ever have the white vinyl version of ""Soundtrack to the End"" again, and the answer is always no.  Just like that, this is your only chance to own the first press colored Vinyl.</p>
<p>Besides this exclusive vinyl, we have equally exclusive merchandise only available through this campaign.</p>
<p>Including:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Unknown Caller T Shirts designed from woodblock carving artist Melissa Schlobohm of Fledgling Press</li>
<li>Access to the last remaining classic t shirts, because when they sell they are gone.</li>
<li>Your chance to pick a song recorded live on video just for you.</li>
<li>Merchandise bundles of previous vinyl and CD’s no longer available in stores (or on the internet.)</li>
<li>And personal gifts from the band, like handwritten lyrics, original copies of test presses, video messages and more.</li>
</ul>
<p>With each target, Communist Daughter will release new videos of Johnny &amp; Molly all the way from Alaska, and exclusive B-sides and demos spanning the last 10 years.</p> <h3>The most important part of this campaign is the impact you can have on our future:</h3>
<p>The reality is that the only way that Communist Daughter can continue to make music now that Johnny and Molly have stopped touring is with your direct support.  </p>
<p>Step outside the new music model and let your values match your spending so that Communist Daughter’s music moves into the next decade.</p> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Some people just can't contribute, and we totally understand, but that doesn't mean you can't help:</p>
<ul>
<li>Share the campaign on your social media so that others can learn about us</li>
<li>Click like, comment, subscribe and interact with us to let us know how important Communist Daughter’s music is in your life.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thank you, from Johnny, Molly, Adam, Al, Steve, Dillon and all of the rest of the Communist Daughter team.</p>

What You Get
This is a very limited release. This LP will only be physically released on a colored short run Vinyl. People always ask if we will ever have the white vinyl version of ""Soundtrack to the End"" again, and the answer is always no.  Just like that, this is your only chance to own the first press colored Vinyl.
Besides this exclusive vinyl, we have equally exclusive merchandise only available through this campaign.
Including:

The Unknown Caller T Shirts designed from woodblock carving artist Melissa Schlobohm of Fledgling Press
Access to the last remaining classic t shirts, because when they sell they are gone.
Your chance to pick a song recorded live on video just for you.
Merchandise bundles of previous vinyl and CD’s no longer available in stores (or on the internet.)
And personal gifts from the band, like handwritten lyrics, original copies of test presses, video messages and more.

With each target, Communist Daughter will release new videos of Johnny & Molly all the way from Alaska, and exclusive B-sides and demos spanning the last 10 years. The most important part of this campaign is the impact you can have on our future:
The reality is that the only way that Communist Daughter can continue to make music now that Johnny and Molly have stopped touring is with your direct support.  
Step outside the new music model and let your values match your spending so that Communist Daughter’s music moves into the next decade. Other Ways You Can Help
Some people just can't contribute, and we totally understand, but that doesn't mean you can't help:

<p></p>
<p>Howdy! My name is Muck Sticky. I am an independent musician
from Memphis, TN. When I began making music in 1999, it was strictly for my own
enjoyment because music makes me feel good. Period. Then I
shared it with my best friend Dennis, and he loved it. So I started sharing my
songs with a few other friends, and they all started telling me my songs make them feel good too! I realized this was my life’s purpose: to
make other people feel good with music. And to motivate people to follow their dreams, and live a positive, productive life. <br/></p>
<p>I grew up in a lower-middle class income family, and we live
in a pretty tough neighborhood. After my
parents got divorced when I was 14 years old, I started working various manual
labor jobs to support my mom and sister. And when I began making music, I spent every extra dollar that didn’t go
toward our bills on new music gear, recording equipment, blank CD's so I could burn
copies of my songs for my friends, flyers for my shows, and whatever else I
needed to get the music out there. </p>
<p>In 2004 I released my first full-length album “The Nifty
Mervous Thrifty”. Since then I’ve self-produced and released 14 albums, manufactured
and personally distributed thousands of CD's, booked and performed thousands of live concerts, and released 40 professional quality music videos, all without ever having to be in debt or under the control of a
record label. It’s just been my family, my friends, my fans, and me this whole time...</p>
<p></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""326"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FoI6Y1ken7pU%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DoI6Y1ken7pU%26feature%3Dyoutu.be&amp;image=http%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FoI6Y1ken7pU%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube"" width=""580""></iframe></div><br/><p></p>
<p>I've dedicated my life to music, and am beyond thankful for the ability to be creative. After fifteen years of never taking a
single day off from being my own manager, booking agent, record label operator,
publicist, show promoter, production coordinator, advertiser, accountant,
studio engineer, video producer/director/editor, graphic/web designer, social
media manager, and every other job that goes along with running a musical
business, I’ve decided to reach out to my friends all over the world for help. This is my first time doing an online-sourced project, and I put it together myself. Music is my only source of income, and my only means of supporting my family.<br/></p>
I recently had some health issues due to the
extreme amount of stress that goes with carrying the entire load of my business
on my shoulders, and funding everything out of my own pocket for the last
fifteen years. And I am overwhelmed by the amount of love and concern y’all
have shown me on Facebook and all of my other social media sites. I can’t run
this whole thing myself anymore, but I also can’t afford to pay anyone to help
me. I just barely keep the bills paid as it is. If we can reach our goal or surpass it, I will not only be able to successfully release this album, but we will also be able to significantly increase the future productivity level here in the Muck Sticky world.<br/><p></p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get<br/>
</h3> <p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Most artists on a label have an entire
team of people who get paid to handle their business for them, and the label
also supports the artists with financial backing. The average budget for most
major label artists to record, mix, manufacture, promote and distribute an
album is $100k-$300k. Not to mention a large budget for touring support,
merchandise manufacturing costs, and the countless other expenses that
accompany the release of a successful album. </p>
<p>Now, after fifteen years of recording
and releasing albums on my own, I am planning to release my 15th album “Dang!” on
5-15-15. And recently a few record labels have begun to take interest in me. I
have already funded most of the recording of this album myself, so I don’t want
to give it up to a label. I just can’t do it! They might make me stop wearing
my pajama pants!!! <br/></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1329331/files/20150326143855-DangCoverPromo_600.jpg?1427405935"" src="""" style=""""/></p>As many of you know, I have been
wearing pajama pants as my public attire for more than 4,650 days. I started
wearing pajamas in public and on stage right from the very beginning, but it became a permanent
style when my best friend Dennis passed away about two years into my career. He
told me I should always be comfortable, and never change my style for anyone.
All I need is the support of my friends! And that way I can keep being independent, and I
don’t have to give a record label the vast majority of the money generated from
the music I’ve put my blood, sweat, tears, and money into since I got started
over 15 years ago. Here is how you can help me stay independent<p></p>

<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3>
</div><p>Over the years, I’ve had countless
friends ask me how they can help get my music and message heard around the
world. Since I’ve never had a “single” on the radio, I basically just ask
people to share the music with their friends. And if that’s all you can do,
then please just share this with your friends. I will still appreciate you just
as much, and give you a big hug the next time I see you. But in order to make
this album be the best it can possibly be, I need to alleviate some of the
stress and financial worries that my family and I have had these past fifteen
years, and for once in my career have a “budget” to work with. I’ve never been
able to make an album with complete freedom from worrying about how to release
it successfully.  Which, as an artist, is
a huge mental challenge.</p><p>I’ve also personally paid for the
production costs of the 40 professional quality music videos
we’ve done since 2004. The filming, editing, graphic design, special 
effects,
and everything else has pretty much all been done by me and a few 
friends with
no budget, yet we’ve managed to release them successfully and we 
currently have over 15
million views online. <br/></p><p></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""435"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2Fart8iIJ199A%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3Dart8iIJ199A&amp;image=http%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2Fart8iIJ199A%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube"" width=""580""></iframe></div><br/><p></p><p>In 2012, I took on my largest project to date by

<h3>
<b>Why I need your help</b><br/>
</h3>
<p>Many of you might be wondering why I need a budget to release this 
album. Most artists at this stage in their career have a record label or
 a personal financial backer who helps cover their recording and 
promotional costs. And most artists in the music industry have a 
$100k-$300k budget to spend on recording, CD manufacturing, and to hire a
 publicist to run a 4-6 month ($2k-$5k/month) promotional campaign for 
each album and expose their music to the world. Muck Sticky has never 
had any of that. For the first time in my career I am asking my fans to 
help me obtain a budget to work with, even if it's a fraction of what 
most other artists have. Here is how the money will be used in this 
particular campaign...<br/><br/>$12,000 - 4 months of recording costs (studio time, daily expenses, etc)<br/>$5,000 - CD Manufacturing<br/>$4,000 - T-shirt Manufacturing<br/>$8,000-$12,000 - Publicist/promotional campaign (4-6 months, $2k per month)<br/>$2,000-$6,000 - Music video production (1-3 videos)<br/><br/>Although
 this budget may seem high to some of you, it's actually absurdly low 
compared to most musical artists. And that's because I am able to do 
most of this myself, and have been for the last fourteen albums. But there are still expenses that need to be 
covered that I can't cover myself. In the past I've always had to cover 
these expenses with my own budget and volunteer help from friends. For 
this album, I need a boost on the front end so I can have the same 
opportunity as most other artists have to successfully release an album.
 Thank you so much for contributing to the future of my music! Keep the good vibes circulating! <br/></p>

(even if you just contribute $5, it will help me reach my goal)

Howdy! My name is Muck Sticky. I am an independent musician
from Memphis, TN. When I began making music in 1999, it was strictly for my own
enjoyment because music makes me feel good. Period. Then I
shared it with my best friend Dennis, and he loved it. So I started sharing my
songs with a few other friends, and they all started telling me my songs make them feel good too! I realized this was my life’s purpose: to
make other people feel good with music. And to motivate people to follow their dreams, and live a positive, productive life. 
I grew up in a lower-middle class income family, and we live
in a pretty tough neighborhood. After my
parents got divorced when I was 14 years old, I started working various manual
labor jobs to support my mom and sister. And when I began making music, I spent every extra dollar that didn’t go
toward our bills on new music gear, recording equipment, blank CD's so I could burn
copies of my songs for my friends, flyers for my shows, and whatever else I
needed to get the music out there. 
In 2004 I released my first full-length album “The Nifty
Mervous Thrifty”. Since then I’ve self-produced and released 14 albums, manufactured
and personally distributed thousands of CD's, booked and performed thousands of live concerts, and released 40 professional quality music videos, all without ever having to be in debt or under the control of a
record label. It’s just been my family, my friends, my fans, and me this whole time...

I've dedicated my life to music, and am beyond thankful for the ability to be creative. After fifteen years of never taking a
single day off from being my own manager, booking agent, record label operator,
publicist, show promoter, production coordinator, advertiser, accountant,
studio engineer, video producer/director/editor, graphic/web designer, social
media manager, and every other job that goes along with running a musical
business, I’ve decided to reach out to my friends all over the world for help. This is my first time doing an online-sourced project, and I put it together myself. Music is my only source of income, and my only means of supporting my family.
I recently had some health issues due to the
extreme amount of stress that goes with carrying the entire load of my business
on my shoulders, and funding everything out of my own pocket for the last
fifteen years. And I am overwhelmed by the amount of love and concern y’all
have shown me on Facebook and all of my other social media sites. I can’t run
this whole thing myself anymore, but I also can’t afford to pay anyone to help
me. I just barely keep the bills paid as it is. If we can reach our goal or surpass it, I will not only be able to successfully release this album, but we will also be able to significantly increase the future productivity level here in the Muck Sticky world.   What We Need & What You Get
 

Most artists on a label have an entire
team of people who get paid to handle their business for them, and the label
also supports the artists with financial backing. The average budget for most
major label artists to record, mix, manufacture, promote and distribute an
album is $100k-$300k. Not to mention a large budget for touring support,
merchandise manufacturing costs, and the countless other expenses that
accompany the release of a successful album. 
Now, after fifteen years of recording
and releasing albums on my own, I am planning to release my 15th album “Dang!” on
5-15-15. And recently a few record labels have begun to take interest in me. I
have already funded most of the recording of this album myself, so I don’t want
to give it up to a label. I just can’t do it! They might make me stop wearing
my pajama pants!!! 

As many of you know, I have been
wearing pajama pants as my public attire for more than 4,650 days. I started
wearing pajamas in public and on stage right from the very beginning, but it became a permanent
style when my best friend Dennis passed away about two years into my career. He
told me I should always be comfortable, and never change my style for anyone.
All I need is the support of my friends! And that way I can keep being independent, and I
don’t have to give a record label the vast majority of the money generated from
the music I’ve put my blood, sweat, tears, and money into since I got started
over 15 years ago. Here is how you can help me stay independent



















Private online hour-long video concert/web chat with you and as many of your friends you can fit in front of your computer screen + 1 physical autographed copy of the new CD “Dang!” (Backer exclusive cover art) + 1 Wristband + 1 Sticker + 1 autographed thank you card

    The Impact
Over the years, I’ve had countless
friends ask me how they can help get my music and message heard around the
world. Since I’ve never had a “single” on the radio, I basically just ask
people to share the music with their friends. And if that’s all you can do,
then please just share this with your friends. I will still appreciate you just
as much, and give you a big hug the next time I see you. But in order to make
this album be the best it can possibly be, I need to alleviate some of the
stress and financial worries that my family and I have had these past fifteen
years, and for once in my career have a “budget” to work with. I’ve never been
able to make an album with complete freedom from worrying about how to release
it successfully.  Which, as an artist, is
a huge mental challenge.I’ve also personally paid for the
production costs of the 40 professional quality music videos
we’ve done since 2004. The filming, editing, graphic design, special 
effects,
and everything else has pretty much all been done by me and a few 
friends with
no budget, yet we’ve managed to release them successfully and we 
currently have over 15
million views online. In 2012, I took on my largest project to date by 
writing/producing/directing/starring in a movie called ""Muscadine Wine"" 
with my mom and my friends. It's a 60 minute long feature film, and we 
made it for less than $1,000. But we've never released it publicly due 
to lack of budget/distribution. Here is the trailer...
We would also like to make a documentary soon, but that depends on the success of this campaign. Instead of going to a big major
record label and taking on huge amounts of debt, I’ve decided to reach out to
y’all and simply ask for your support to help Muck Sticky stay independent and

<li>
<p>This project really has the potential to breath life into our local music-making culture and could even become a music-making culture across the globe.

<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1438209879/nbefi5ow4lwurcgdebgo.jpg"" src="""" style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""/></p>
<br/>
</li>
<ul>
<li><p>By crowdfunding the gear with our album pre-sales, there will be no extra gear cost for which to compensate.</p></li>
<li><p>The studio will be in Nathan’s basement (for phase one of the project) so there will be no extra facilities cost.</p></li>
<li><p>Nathan has 15 years in audio engineering and music production, and Isaac has a lifetime of experience writing and arranging music. So, there will be no extra engineer or producer fees. </p></li>
<li><p>In order to produce a commercial release album artists will typically pay $5k-$50k and up depending on their specific needs. Since Kingdom Choirs will own the studio we will be able to charge a fraction of what it would normally cost for an artist to make a record.</p></li>
</ul>
<li><p>It’s go time! Kingdom Choirs has always wanted to release music that envelopes hearts with God’s love and build a studio for artists to create their music-making destinies.</p></li>

<br/><p><b>Risks &amp; Challenges</b></p>
<ul>
<li><p>There are inherent challenges with a campaign like this. The most foreseeable challenges are: </p></li>

<li><p>Orchestrating logistics for booking artists in the studio at a low cost.  </p></li>
</ul>
<li><p>These challenges are not insurmountable by any means. If needed, here’s how we plan to overcome these challenges:</p></li>

We are Kingdom Choirs. We have an overwhelming desire to see a whole community of musicians step into their destinies as creatives. We've spent many sleepless nights in anticipation of building a space for our friends to come and create passionate, world changing music. We believe this campaign is the first step toward realizing our vision.  



This campaign is about building a recording studio for a whole community of artists. This will enable Kingdom Choirs and others to make records now and countless records in the future. 

We could not be more excited to be releasing an album that makes much of Jesus, and at the same time, has massive potential to help a whole community of musicians fulfill their destinies! Your contributions are going to shift the way records are made here in Springfield, MO. Let’s start with this small step and hope to effect music-making culture worldwide!

What We Need & What You Get

We need $16k to complete this album and phase 1 of the studio project. Most of the $16k will go towards studio gear as the foundation of a high end studio. The funds will be distributed in these 6 categories:


Monitors - the speakers that the music is mixed on.




Microphones - you probably know what these are.






Ad/da Converters -the gear that gets the recordings into a computer.





Preamps / Console- the gear that makes microphones work and sound good.





Studio essentials - things like cables, mic stands, sound treatment, etc.




Merch for you guys - t-shirts, stickers, etc.

What's in it for you? Check out our perks on the right side of the screen. Grab a Kingdom Choirs' album and a digital download. Want your name in our album credits? You can do that too. You can even get some studio time in Kingdom Choirs’ studio for yourself or someone you love. 
If we do not reach our full goal, the money raised will go towards gear choices that make the most sense for our community of artists. We will continually be focused on helping artist get their music out. All perks will still apply. 

The Impact


This project really has the potential to breath life into our local music-making culture and could even become a music-making culture across the globe. We will be able to drive the cost for studio time way DOWN, and this will help artists get their music out. Here’s how we can charge MUCH less:






By crowdfunding the gear with our album pre-sales, there will be no extra gear cost for which to compensate.
The studio will be in Nathan’s basement (for phase one of the project) so there will be no extra facilities cost.
Nathan has 15 years in audio engineering and music production, and Isaac has a lifetime of experience writing and arranging music. So, there will be no extra engineer or producer fees. 
In order to produce a commercial release album artists will typically pay $5k-$50k and up depending on their specific needs. Since Kingdom Choirs will own the studio we will be able to charge a fraction of what it would normally cost for an artist to make a record.

It’s go time! Kingdom Choirs has always wanted to release music that envelopes hearts with God’s love and build a studio for artists to create their music-making destinies.





Risks & Challenges

There are inherent challenges with a campaign like this. The most foreseeable challenges are: 

Being able to raise enough money for the idea to work. 
Orchestrating logistics for booking artists in the studio at a low cost.  

These challenges are not insurmountable by any means. If needed, here’s how we plan to overcome these challenges:

We really do need to raise at least $16k, but if we cannot come up with this amount of funds there will be other possible, albeit less ideal studio scenarios. We will simply have to downgrade from professional audio gear to a “pro-sumer” or even consumer level technology. Will we still be able to make a record on this gear? Yes, but we prefer not to compromise quality. 

How will we book artists in the studio at a low cost? The studio will be open on a part-time basis in Nathan’s basement, and Nathan’s schedule is flexible enough to be able to accommodate the artists scheduling needs. The artist will only be charged on the basis of keeping the project studio sustainable.

And in spite of having lost faith in myself for 2 years, and in that time, letting go of it all, you never lost faith in me and my music.  And so you cheered when I got up again and celebrated when one song, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnHLHyP08Z8"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Coming to Love</a>, finally went the distance to be fully produced -flowering into the vision I held for it and bringing more joy than I know.  This inspired the release of 2 more over the next 2 years -opening the door for everywhere to go from here.  All thanks to you, a great community spanning the East and West Coast -and some around the world.  Special thanks to the countless number of you who have stood by my side, especially Debra Polomeno.<br/></span></p>

</div></div>","Short Summary
CH2 consists of Corneille Hutten and Leon Gropp, two slightly crazy guitarists that are NUTS and extremely passionate about music. We breath, sleep and eat music! We have a very unique style of play that has a very impressive visual impact, especially the Flamenco / Spanish and Instrumental Pop style that we focus on. We have been lucky enough to have won a couple of awards locally and abroad for our music, and have met some awesome musicians on our travels. We are so grateful and humbled by the opportunities we've had!
Our main goal is to break into the US and world market with a bang! Our album needs to sound absolute international quality and we would LOVE to mix this album by the best we can afford through this campaign. YOUR help in reaching this goal is appreciated beyond measure!
Our long term outlook is to travel the world with our impressive, unique CH2 style of play and perform in all the great halls our industry has to offer!
  What We Need & What You Get The funds gathered through this campaign will be used exclusively to pay for studio time during the recording process, mixing of the album as well as mastering. This album will consist of two discs: one with our own CH2 compositions (14 tracks) and another disc with mash-ups between the most well-known classical pieces in history, paired and played together with some of the most inspiring modern pop hits. The discs will also be released on all iTunes stores worldwide as well as MANY other mainstream music download websites.
To say thank you for your amazing help in raising funds for our crusade into the US and worldwide market, we would love to give you the world, but that might be a bit impractical... 
We created our own little system to show what you get for your valuable contribution. Apart from these prizes your name will also be included as a contributor in the ""Thank You"" section of these 2 discs:
-   $1 contribution will get you a personal Facebook message from CH2 on your Facebook wall to show how much we appreciate your time and support.
-   $5 contribution will get you a free download copy of the album of your choice that will be recorded through this campaign.

</blockquote></h3>WHO I AM<br/>
<p></p>
<p><em>I'm likely</em> not who would typically come to mind when you think of a <em>best seller</em> in <em>Soul-Jazz</em> and <em>Contemporary R&amp;B</em> (a historical mark I made for the flute on Amazon.com with my sophomore album, <em>Soulfisticated</em>.)  The genres are usually dominated by saxophone and vocalists respectively.<br/></p>
<p><b>I am a flautist</b> <b>who</b>, as <em>Detroit Jazz Magazine</em> put it, “<strong>makes the flute speak the urban language of soul” </strong> with a sound “<strong>you normally don’t hear from flautists</strong>.” And who, as <em>Smooth Jazz Therapy</em>, a go-to site for smooth jazz reviews said is “<strong>dispelling the myth that flute players can’t do urban jazz</strong>.” </p>
<p><i>""Soulfisticated</i>"" sat directly between the #4 best seller 
<i>Janelle Monáe</i>‘s “The Electric Lady” and <i>Whitney Houston</i>‘s “Love, 
Whitney” on Amazon Japan’s R&amp;B charts.</p>
<p><em>I</em> learned to speak the language in the best way possible: immersion. Growing up listening to hip hop and R&amp;B on <em>Detroit</em>
 radio in the 1990s, I was the quiet 10 year old riding the line of “loud enough to
 hear but not loud enough for my parents to catch me up so late” when 
basking in <em>Kiss FM</em>s late night quiet storm program “<em>Kisses After Dark</em>” and pressing record and rewind on my hip hop radio mixes. </p>
<p>More recently, a blog from Denmark called me ""an unmistakable voice from an unmistakable talent.""   James <em>Tormé</em> (vocalist, and son of jazz great Mel <em>Tormé</em>) said I have ""a really lyrical way of playing that instrument, not quite like anyone else.”  <b><i><br/><br/>On this upcoming album my flute will be doing all the ""talking"" and trust me: I have a lot to say.  It is my first 100 percent instrumental album (tentatively titled, The Flute.)  It is also the flute album for people who don't think they like flute.</i></b><br/><br/></p>

</div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3>

<h1><i>ONDATROPICA VOL.2</i></h1>
<p>Welcome to the second volume of Ondatrópica´s story. We need your help through this fundraiser to bring our story to the next stage; consider this a digital “passing of the hat” in the internet age.</p>
<p>Our journey has two strands. The first takes us to the island of Providencia (an English speaking enclave of the Colombian Caribbean), for a week-long studio residency, where we will be exploring the connections between Anglo and Hispanic Caribbean music traditions, working with and recording alongside musicians from Providencia. The second, will be a set of more electric, recording sessions in Bogotá, the capital of Colombia and home to the new tropical-futurist scene. </p>
<p><i style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""></i></p>

<h2><i>Providence Island</i></h2>
<p>One side of Colombian musical culture that maybe most people are not aware of, can be found in the Caribbean islands of San Andrés and Providencia. This archipelago was an English colony until the 18th century, when it passed to the newly founded Republic of Colombia. Having kept Creole English as the principal dialect, and with strong commercial and ancestral ties with Jamaica, the sounds of the islands sway between calypso, mento, zouk and reggae. </p>
<h2><i>The Capital</i></h2>
<p>Bogotá on the other hand has rapidly grown into the epicenter of a new Tropicalist experimental movement, with forward thinking bands that have one foot in tradition and the other in innovation. The sum and encounter of these two worlds will be sought. That is the goal of Ondatrópica, to serve as a crossroads and to allow for intimate encounters between creative musicians from different walks of life, be it from a small island or a big city. </p>
<h2><i>Past Steps</i></h2>
<p>The great joy and achievements that Ondatrópica has brought us since embarking upon this musical roller coaster in 2012 have been many! We recorded an iconic first album treasured by many and established a live band, that has to date performed at around 70 locations in 20 countries. From mega festivals like Glastonbury and Roskilde, to squat parties in downtown Bogotá and sports stadiums in Mexico City, Ondatrópica has always been focused on showcasing the interaction of musicians from different styles, regions and generations - an ample serving from Colombia’s musical hot pot. </p>

A new modern classic. There are plenty ways of ways you can help, choose the one that best suits you!  Ondatrópica continues to be an independent endeavor and it is for that reason we need your help.</p>

</p>
<p>Si se preguntan de qué se trata este nuevo viaje, la respuesta tira para 2 lados. Uno: Buscar las conexiones entre el caribe Anglo e Hispano a través de una residencia de creación en la isla de Providencia, enclave angloparlante del caribe Colombiano. Y dos: Unas sesiones más eléctricas en que se acerquen a la movida tropical-futurista de Bogotá.</p>

Welcome to the second volume of Ondatrópica´s story. We need your help through this fundraiser to bring our story to the next stage; consider this a digital “passing of the hat” in the internet age.
Our journey has two strands. The first takes us to the island of Providencia (an English speaking enclave of the Colombian Caribbean), for a week-long studio residency, where we will be exploring the connections between Anglo and Hispanic Caribbean music traditions, working with and recording alongside musicians from Providencia. The second, will be a set of more electric, recording sessions in Bogotá, the capital of Colombia and home to the new tropical-futurist scene. 


Providence Island
One side of Colombian musical culture that maybe most people are not aware of, can be found in the Caribbean islands of San Andrés and Providencia. This archipelago was an English colony until the 18th century, when it passed to the newly founded Republic of Colombia. Having kept Creole English as the principal dialect, and with strong commercial and ancestral ties with Jamaica, the sounds of the islands sway between calypso, mento, zouk and reggae. 
The Capital
Bogotá on the other hand has rapidly grown into the epicenter of a new Tropicalist experimental movement, with forward thinking bands that have one foot in tradition and the other in innovation. The sum and encounter of these two worlds will be sought. That is the goal of Ondatrópica, to serve as a crossroads and to allow for intimate encounters between creative musicians from different walks of life, be it from a small island or a big city. 
Past Steps
The great joy and achievements that Ondatrópica has brought us since embarking upon this musical roller coaster in 2012 have been many! We recorded an iconic first album treasured by many and established a live band, that has to date performed at around 70 locations in 20 countries. From mega festivals like Glastonbury and Roskilde, to squat parties in downtown Bogotá and sports stadiums in Mexico City, Ondatrópica has always been focused on showcasing the interaction of musicians from different styles, regions and generations - an ample serving from Colombia’s musical hot pot. 

The Next Step
We want you to join us in this adventure, accompanying Ondatrópica’s tradition and enterprise of tropical delight. Your help is VITAL, we wish for this record to be an achievement for us all. A new modern classic. There are plenty ways of ways you can help, choose the one that best suits you!  Ondatrópica continues to be an independent endeavor and it is for that reason we need your help.

ONDATROPICA VOL.2
¡Bienvenidos al segundo volumen de Ondatrópica! uno que esperamos armar con su ayuda a través de esta campaña de financiación colectiva, o como diríamos en Colombia, una “vaca” digital. 


Si se preguntan de qué se trata este nuevo viaje, la respuesta tira para 2 lados. Uno: Buscar las conexiones entre el caribe Anglo e Hispano a través de una residencia de creación en la isla de Providencia, enclave angloparlante del caribe Colombiano. Y dos: Unas sesiones más eléctricas en que se acerquen a la movida tropical-futurista de Bogotá.


¿Por qué Providencia y Bogotá?


Una de las culturas musicales que tal vez no mucha gente fuera de Colombia conozca, es la de las islas de San Andrés y Providencia. Este archipiélago estuvo en manos Inglesas hasta el s.XVIII, cuando pasó a la nueva república de Colombia. Habiendo conservado el Ingles creole como lengua materna, y con fuertes conexiones comerciales y familiares con Jamaica, el sonido de la isla se mueve entre el calypso, mentó, reggae y zouk. 
Bogotá por otro lado se ha convertido en el foco de los nuevos experimentos tropicalistas, con proyectos de avanzada que tienen un pié en la tradición y el otro en la innovación. La sumatoria de estos dos ambientes es lo que busca Ondatrópica, servir de puente y propiciar encuentros.


Pasos Recorridos
