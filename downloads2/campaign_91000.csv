All our backers can expect smooth production and delivery!    To read more about BondCable, head over to these awesome sites:Yanko Design, The Straits Times, Geeky Gadgets, Nylon, HardwareZone, MusicPhotoLife, Backerkit, Techable (Japanese)   How it started: from candy to cableThe BondCable was inspired through daily experiences and observations of things around us. While working on ideas to coil and manage cables effectively, the design team casually observed someone with a long Sakeru belt candy. Noticing the grooves on the long candy, the designers were struck by the idea of having self-bonding grooves on a flat cable. The BondCable was thus born!    Process and explorations Our development team spent over 18 months working meticulously with the manufacturer refining the grooved profile, tolerances, material hardness and reliability of the BondCable. Through iterative prototypes testing, evaluation and revision, we are finally at a production-ready outcome.    Sketches and ideation​ Work in progress  Testing prototypes Even the connector can bond to the cable now!We have fabricated all the necessary molds and tooling and have conducted pre-production trials successfully. With your orders and support, we will commence the mass production of BondCable and make them available to backers followed by retail and distribution channels within a few months.    The BondCable packaging will be environmental friendly - no glue, 100% recyclable and degradable. It is designed with sufficient material to cover and protect the product for shipping and at the same time minimizing the carbon footprint left onto our planet.    About Us: CleverThings  Smart Phones, Smart Watches, Smart Cars, Smart TV, Smart Homes…Enough Smart Things.We are CleverThings.As stated in our brand tagline ‘Enough Smart Things’ , we are tired of hearing and using the word smart and decided to create clever products instead.

<h2>Hi. I am Hideaki Seike from Adplus.</h2>
<p>Elephant Steady is a stabilizer for iPhone
which were able to raise $80,000 in Kickstarter and Campfire.</p>
<p>Currently the Elephant Steady is only
available in black color. Black is an ideal color for photographing
equipment and household electric appliances. However, I think there should be more colors for this product to let users enjoy taking movies.</p>
<p>In Kickstarter, we had set a stretch goal of adding colors if we reach $100,000.
But we could not meet the goal. I still
wish that the Elephant Steady could be available in different colors and be a
more attractive product.</p>
<p>We want
to raise the rest $20,000 in INDIEGOGO and accomplish the stretch goal of
adding more colors. Please

<p>Above is the drawing of the Elephant Steady's working principle. The Elephant Steady is connected to iPhone using the headphone minijack. The iPhone App,Elephant Cam, controls the two motors using pulse code. You can contorl the ON/OFF by the power switch. The motor's power is supplied by the lithium-ion battery. The tilt control button uses the headphone's volume control signal and transmit to the iPhone App, Elephant Cam. With the iPhone's gyro sensor and tilt control button's signal, the Elephant Cam detects the suitable angle and controls the motor.</p>

<h2>Risks and challenges</h2>
<p>In carrying out our project, we will absolutely do our best to fulfill our promise to the supporters. However, when we are developing such new products, we are always attended with risks.</p>
<p>The most concerning factor we have is that how much we can make the motor move smoothly. We put efforts on making sophisticated programs to keep the servomotor’s moving smooth and the body size compact and light. Also to give high endurance, we test and improve the products repeatedly.</p>
<p>We promise to clear all the risks and challenges, and complete the “elephant-steady” as it is on the project now. Currently, we are collecting data using the prototype model and planning to release our first “elephant-steady” around February, 2015.</p>
<p>We will do our best to give out the awards to our supporters as soon as possible. In addition, if there happens to be some trouble and we are obliged to delay the shipping of the awards, we will definitely announce what is going on and how things will go.</p>
<p>We take pride in producing and selling iPhone accessories, and are looking forward to launching our innovative products to you.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>FAQ</h2>
<h4><b>Do you plan to make the Elephant Steady compatible with Android devices?</b></h4>
<p>Regarding Android device, the pulse code output from the headphone jack differs by model. For this, it needs extra works to adjust the program. We are currently planning to choose some Android smartphones and develop applications for them.</p>
<p> </p>
<h4><b>Do you plan to make the Elephant Steady 3 axes?</b></h4>
<p>This stabilizer works only by the headphone jack to reduce the production cost and make the body size compact. Also the Elephant Steady uses stereo 2 channel of the headphone jack and controls the 2 motors. With this current system, we could only make it 2 axes.</p>
<p> </p>
<h4><b>Are there any plans to angle the headphone plug?</b></h4>
<p>Yes, we plan to angle the headphone plug and make it more slim.</p>
<p> </p>
<h4><b>Is the Elephant Steady compatible with iPod touch 4?</b></h4>
<p>The Elephant Steady uses gyro sensor and enable photographing movies with HD quality at the same time. For this, it needs high management device. <br/>
If you actuate on your iPod touch 4, you may end up with taking low picture quality movie. However, we will try our best to make it compatible with iPod touch 4.</p>
<p> </p>
<h4><b>Can I use it with my iPhone cases on?</b></h4>
<p>We are planning to improve the claw parts, where it holds your smartphone. If your case was thin, you can use it with your case on.</p>
<p> </p>
<h4><b>Can the Elephant Steady really stabilize the smartphone with it's small size?</b></h4>
<p>The Elephant Steady uses 2 motors, meaning 2 drives and 2 axis. <br/>
The motor we're going to use has 1.7kg/cm of torque. <br/>
It can stabilize your smartphone even with your cases on.</p>
<p> </p>
<h4><b>How will the sound be recorded?</b></h4>
<p>The sound will be recorded through your iPhone's microphone.</p>
<p> </p>
<h4><b>How will the external microphone be fixed?</b></h4>
<p>Although Elephant Steady uses the headphone jack to connect with iPhone, there are three ways to record voice with the ""Elephant Cam"" <br/>
1. Use the microphone built in your iPhone <br/>
2. By using headphone splitter, you can fix the external microphone with mini plug type.<br/>
3. By using the lightning connector, you can fix the external microphone.</p>
<p> </p>
<h4><b>Please tell me about the shipping cost.</b></h4>

World’s smallest motor stabilizer
With this new structure, we were able to make the size compact compared to the general motor stabilizers. As a result, elephant steady is both successful at portability and excellent functionality.
 
Camera App Exclusive for Elephant Steady

Elephant cam is available for free. You can control the motor and take your movie using this app. In addition, we are planning to add more functions in the future.
 
Other features

 

 
Electronics

Above is the drawing of the Elephant Steady's working principle. The Elephant Steady is connected to iPhone using the headphone minijack. The iPhone App,Elephant Cam, controls the two motors using pulse code. You can contorl the ON/OFF by the power switch. The motor's power is supplied by the lithium-ion battery. The tilt control button uses the headphone's volume control signal and transmit to the iPhone App, Elephant Cam. With the iPhone's gyro sensor and tilt control button's signal, the Elephant Cam detects the suitable angle and controls the motor.
 
WHERE WE'RE AT

Risks and challenges
In carrying out our project, we will absolutely do our best to fulfill our promise to the supporters. However, when we are developing such new products, we are always attended with risks.
The most concerning factor we have is that how much we can make the motor move smoothly. We put efforts on making sophisticated programs to keep the servomotor’s moving smooth and the body size compact and light. Also to give high endurance, we test and improve the products repeatedly.
We promise to clear all the risks and challenges, and complete the “elephant-steady” as it is on the project now. Currently, we are collecting data using the prototype model and planning to release our first “elephant-steady” around February, 2015.
We will do our best to give out the awards to our supporters as soon as possible. In addition, if there happens to be some trouble and we are obliged to delay the shipping of the awards, we will definitely announce what is going on and how things will go.
We take pride in producing and selling iPhone accessories, and are looking forward to launching our innovative products to you.
 
FAQ
Do you plan to make the Elephant Steady compatible with Android devices?
Regarding Android device, the pulse code output from the headphone jack differs by model. For this, it needs extra works to adjust the program. We are currently planning to choose some Android smartphones and develop applications for them.
 
Do you plan to make the Elephant Steady 3 axes?
This stabilizer works only by the headphone jack to reduce the production cost and make the body size compact. Also the Elephant Steady uses stereo 2 channel of the headphone jack and controls the 2 motors. With this current system, we could only make it 2 axes.
 
Are there any plans to angle the headphone plug?
Yes, we plan to angle the headphone plug and make it more slim.
 
Is the Elephant Steady compatible with iPod touch 4?
The Elephant Steady uses gyro sensor and enable photographing movies with HD quality at the same time. For this, it needs high management device. 
If you actuate on your iPod touch 4, you may end up with taking low picture quality movie. However, we will try our best to make it compatible with iPod touch 4.
 
Can I use it with my iPhone cases on?
We are planning to improve the claw parts, where it holds your smartphone. If your case was thin, you can use it with your case on.
 
Can the Elephant Steady really stabilize the smartphone with it's small size?
The Elephant Steady uses 2 motors, meaning 2 drives and 2 axis. 
The motor we're going to use has 1.7kg/cm of torque. 
It can stabilize your smartphone even with your cases on.
 
How will the sound be recorded?
The sound will be recorded through your iPhone's microphone.
 
How will the external microphone be fixed?
Although Elephant Steady uses the headphone jack to connect with iPhone, there are three ways to record voice with the ""Elephant Cam"" 
1. Use the microphone built in your iPhone 
2. By using headphone splitter, you can fix the external microphone with mini plug type.
3. By using the lightning connector, you can fix the external microphone.
 
Please tell me about the shipping cost.
Not only Japan but also backers from the US are free of shipping cost. 
However, backers from country outside of the US and Japan need to pay extra $20 for shipping cost.

That is why we eliminated any needs for another power bank by allowing for a Multi-Device charger without losing charging speeds. Now, you can charge three devices at the same time; wired or wireless, while our competitors can't even charge two devices. We've thrown in a USB Qualcomm for fast and efficient 3.0 charging speeds, a USB-C to allocate for newer devices and an 18w output, 15w of pure, wireless charging, and of course, a MicroUSB for those devices that depend on them. One CherryPack can charge your phones, computers, headphones, watches - all the essential tech needed.Bringing your iPhone and AirPods? Not an issue. What about my laptop and Samsung? We've got you covered. All combinations are adaptive to our power bank. They just need to include one of the following - USB-C, Qi, USB 3.0, MicroUSB This isn't even close to the number of devices CherryPack supports; we just figured you will have a gadget similar to one shown!We are adopting the latest Scientific Advancements in Nano-Technology...Nano-Technology is not a word you hear every day, and there is a good reason for that. The science is so new that discoveries in Nano-Tech are happening this very moment. The CherryPack has utilized Nano-Tech in out suction cups to arrange the atmospheric atoms engulfed by the suction to the perfect amount of air pressure. This provides stability and strength in the cups, while still being able to be removed when wanted to.                              Nano-Technology in action on the CherryPack On top of this, wireless charging is on the CherryPack, and provides 15w of action straight from the box. There is no reason to bring an iPhone or Android cable on your next time going out, trip, or any activity with the CherryPack.\This is the backbone to the CherryPack. A truly revolutionary design starts with backers like you supporting the project. This allows us to utilize Nano-Technology in other ways in all future products.                                                     
We know that some of you will want to know what Nano-Technology brings to our product and any future ones.  If you want to learn more, you can watch the following video.Who needs wires when you can Wirelessly Charge!?Yes, that is correct. The CherryPack provides 15w wirelessly while every other power bank and pad struggle to achieve 10w. We know that time is of the essence in everyone's life, so we made Fast-Charging wirelessly an essential counterpart to our Nano-Tech Suction Cups. This instant pairing makes the CherryPack truly unique and one of a kind. A showcase of the Qi Charging aspectTo add on, we have passed Qi Certification, meaning our product has gone through the most rigorous testing by the battery industry. This ensures the safety and security of every CherryPack ever made.AirPod Users - we know your pain, and we are here to change it.We know for a fact AirPods aren't easy to charge on the go. Having to bring an extra cable along is a hassle that will change, starting now. The Qi pad on the CherryPack allows for a fast, 15w wireless output to your AirPods Case, charging the case from 0 to 100 in under 30 minutes.                                                                Demonstration of AirPods and AirPod ProsOnly the highest grade batteries are usedWhen it comes to the battery, it is not something to cheap out on. That is why we have passed the intensive guidelines set by the battery industry and certified to say we did. Here at Cherry, we value your safety over our products, and we know this is the component that matters the most.CherryPack in use for Airpods and a MacBook10,000 mAhFitting multiple days worth of energy is difficult considering the size of the CherryPack.Our batteries are rated for 10,000 mAh or about 2.5x iPhone charges from 0-100 (to find the specification for your device, do 10,000/your device's charge). When considering other competitors, we may not be the most powerful battery, but there is no power bank that does not require wires beside us. There will never be a need to bring those tangled and long wires with the CherryPack, we have eliminated them.The charging speeds of the CherryPack are the fastest in the market wirelessly. We support all Fast Charging requirements for all new iPhone and Android devices, allowing us to the full power of 15w to deliver energy straight to your phone. Ports for all Essential DevicesYour devices are bound to have one of the following; USB 3.0, USB C, MicroUSB, or Qi (Specific Specs in the ""Specs"" category). Out of all these ports, you can utilize three at the same time without losing power speed. The CherryPack makes it so that this is the only and last charger you will ever need to commute your daily life.

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">But WHY? A Quick Explanation</h3>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""> </h3>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">The Other HMDs (Head Mounted Displays) aka ""was-OK-until-now-but-actually-really-low-resolution""</h3>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">In classic VR displays, the screen is split into 2 halves, with a tiny screen for each eye, to recreate the sensations of 3D. In order to fit a 2D movie for each eye, the HMD's use an app that reduces the size of content 4 times. That's why it's always grainy.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1488804920/fcnrelvggv4crbdhuijx.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">This<strong> </strong>leaves <strong>less than 25%</strong> of the screen pixels for video content.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">It also tricks your brain into thinking it's seeing something other than what it is, <strong>which makes you dizzy</strong>. Which is why most people can't even watch half a movie on them.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">So we invented some new optical technology that displays 100% of the pixels. It sounds simple. It wasn't.  </h3>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">It's called MOGO and it retains and shows you 100% of your phone's resolution.</p>
<p> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1488376813/yumvg6dum4ztkp7vuume.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">How it works: An oversimplified graphic.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
</div>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<h2> </h2>
<h2>How the magic is done OR what is special in MoGo optics:</h2>
<p>The core technology in MoGo is in oculars that are aspherical prismatic lenses making possible to see with both eyes  (in biocular way) wide screen of smartphone positioned near lenses. The oculars transform physical screen into two virtual that are enlarged, taken to far distance and shifted toward each eye correspondingly. </p>
</div>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1502115550/n3qnzuu22cwttz0yjspk.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>This relaxes your eyes provides almoust a ""natural eye-sight"" which eliminates the side effects known to impact the Virtual Reality optical approach.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1488783982/yykthvvhcrgndcyxalvu.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p><br/>Currently, each ocular is single piece lens. Even though that the single piece lens optical performance is limited, it provides excellent user experience for watching movies.</p>
<p>To be transparent with the bakers we must also mention the known cons: there are slight chromatic aberrations and geometrical distortions accommodated by the brain for majority of the users; peripheral areas of the screen as less sharp than big central zone, however, they are used mostly for awareness  (since the FoV is 90deg) and most of users doesn't care of that.</p>
<p>Read comments to get more info about pros and cons.</p>
<p>The concept of MoGo is patent pending and there is a possibility to use multiple optical elements to resolve the cons presented above. Cinema2Go perform R&amp;D to make the ocular also appropriate for professional Virtual Remote Desktop and not just for videos/movies watching. We continue to hold the MoGo on Indiegogo for possibility to continue getting valuable comments and advices from the bakers</p>

2 types of MOGO
(1) For the smartphone and (2) with built-in screen for the pro
Both types are foldable to be taken to travels

Start watching your smartphone display's full pixel potential. 

 
 
MOGO isn't 3D or VR -​those are dizzying with regular videos. No, this is Hi-Resolution 2D.Finally. Done. Right.
 
 
MOGO: A Better Viewing Experience.


 

 
The Pixel Match-up
 

 
But WHY? A Quick Explanation
 
The Other HMDs (Head Mounted Displays) aka ""was-OK-until-now-but-actually-really-low-resolution""
In classic VR displays, the screen is split into 2 halves, with a tiny screen for each eye, to recreate the sensations of 3D. In order to fit a 2D movie for each eye, the HMD's use an app that reduces the size of content 4 times. That's why it's always grainy.

 
This leaves less than 25% of the screen pixels for video content.
It also tricks your brain into thinking it's seeing something other than what it is, which makes you dizzy. Which is why most people can't even watch half a movie on them.
 
So we invented some new optical technology that displays 100% of the pixels. It sounds simple. It wasn't.  
It's called MOGO and it retains and shows you 100% of your phone's resolution.
 

How it works: An oversimplified graphic.
 

 
 
How the magic is done OR what is special in MoGo optics:
The core technology in MoGo is in oculars that are aspherical prismatic lenses making possible to see with both eyes  (in biocular way) wide screen of smartphone positioned near lenses. The oculars transform physical screen into two virtual that are enlarged, taken to far distance and shifted toward each eye correspondingly. 


This relaxes your eyes provides almoust a ""natural eye-sight"" which eliminates the side effects known to impact the Virtual Reality optical approach.

Currently, each ocular is single piece lens. Even though that the single piece lens optical performance is limited, it provides excellent user experience for watching movies.
To be transparent with the bakers we must also mention the known cons: there are slight chromatic aberrations and geometrical distortions accommodated by the brain for majority of the users; peripheral areas of the screen as less sharp than big central zone, however, they are used mostly for awareness  (since the FoV is 90deg) and most of users doesn't care of that.
Read comments to get more info about pros and cons.
The concept of MoGo is patent pending and there is a possibility to use multiple optical elements to resolve the cons presented above. Cinema2Go perform R&D to make the ocular also appropriate for professional Virtual Remote Desktop and not just for videos/movies watching. We continue to hold the MoGo on Indiegogo for possibility to continue getting valuable comments and advices from the bakers

<h3>Keep it safe, keep it dry, keep your iPad anywhere -- even in the shower with WeShower.</h3>
<h3> </h3>
<p>You can shower naked. Your iPad can't. Protect your iPad inside a waterproof case with stereo speakers. The two main goals for the project are to protect the iPad from the elements and improve the sound quality by adding the best waterproof speakers we could find.</p>
<h3> </h3>
<p>Our website is currently really bare-bones, but we plan on adding to it as we go along, but for now we're focusing on getting the WeShower case ready for prime time.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Prototype Info:</h3>
<p>The prototype in the video is made on a rapid prototyping machine, so the plastic texture and color are not final. Our current plan is to make the whole case translucent, so you can see the electronics inside and the iPad as well. Of course we'll have a nice clear screen protector (and camera protectors). The label for the power and volume controls are going to look much nicer, too. For the prototype we just used vinyl tape, cut to shape. The plan is either to texture the case itself or screen print the shapes on the case.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Why we are coming to you:</h3>
<p>You can see in the video that we've gotten the case designed and a prototype built, but it takes serious cash (tens of thousands of dollars) to get injection molding tools made (they're basically giant chunks of steel that have the inside carved out in the shape of all the parts of the case). We know some great tool makers here in the US, so we can work closely with them during the process, and end up with a great tool set. We need your help to get this idea into production. We're working on the final circuit board designs as well, and need to make a few hundred for the first production run.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Please help us spread the word!</h3>
<p>If you don't feel like you want to contribute, please pass along the project to someone who might.  We know there are a lot of people out there who want better protection for their iPad.  Please use the Indiegogo sharing tools to pass it along, or just email them a link.  Thanks!</p>
<h3>How Deep does Waterproof mean?</h3>
<p>We think there is enough air inside the case so it will float if you drop it off your boat, but we won't be sure until we test it. We think it will be pretty cool if you can use it underwater, but we aren't sure how deep. It may not matter anyway, because underwater the iPad touchscreen may not work very well, and while they are waterproof, we're not sure how well the speakers will perform underwater. Even just a few feet down, the water pressure starts to add up fast.</p>
<h2>The Team:</h2>
<p>Before introducing each team member, we want to emphasize how well each person on our team works together with each of the others. Even though we all have our specialties, there are some overlapping skills that help us avoid issues during the design and prototyping phase so they don't become problems in production. Our mechanical team knows quite a bit about electronics, and our electronics and firmware team know quite a bit about plastic injection molding. We have great support from the company we buy our microcontrollers from, and our team has a well established track record of making great products.</p>
<h3>Cody Labrum - Concept</h3>
<p>Cody has been thinking ""outside the box"" for years, coming up with new ideas and interesting twists on old ones. This project was inspired by a waterproof shower radio that Cody's dad brought home (many years ago). Think of all the useful things you could do during that (otherwise not-terribly-productive) time. Some of us on the team get some of our best ideas while taking a shower, and having this product would let us not only take notes about our epiphanies but also let us sketch them up while they are fresh on our minds.</p>
<h3>Phil Dietz - Industrial Design and Mechanical</h3>
<p>Phil has many years' experience designing home appliances, aircraft parts, and heavy industrial machinery. We can't tell you the names of the companies he works for (the lawyers can get so touchy!) but you'd definitely recognize the brands. Some of his projects can be used to build (or destroy) entire buildings, while others just destroy frozen fruit to make a good smoothie.</p>
<h3>Martin Johnson - Electronics and Audio Amplifier</h3>
<p>If you've used an XBee(r) radio module, you've seen Martin's work before. He did the electrical design for several radio modems, has designed wireless control systems, and a lot of other really sweet electronic devices. He is passionate about thorough testing of a design before shipping it to a customer, which results in solid products with low return rates.</p>
<h3>Jeremy Willden - Firmware and Touch Interface</h3>
<p>Jeremy builds embedded firmware in a very careful, structured way, resulting in code that is easy to understand, debug, and add features to. Jeremy is a big proponent of open-source software and hardware, and also put together the video for the project. Jeremy also helped design the XBee(r) radio module, and also made it fast and easy to manufacture. His production test and programming systems cranked out more than ten times as many products per hour as the previous ones without a lot of new equipment.</p>
<h3>What Does The Future Hold?</h3>
<p>If we knew that, we'd be day traders in the stock market. ;-) Seriously, though, after we get the first version to market, we plan to branch out and add features, more color choices, and other versions of the product. Like all good indiegogo projects, we know that you will give us good feedback and ideas to make the product (or future versions) better. The plan is to make the cover replaceable so you can have different color choices without having to replace the electronics, speakers, or the main shell. As we said above, the case will probably be translucent as well. There's a good chance will do a case with a Bluetooth interface instead of the plug-in cord, but we avoided that on the first version because it's more expensive to manufacture than the cord is.</p>
<h3>The Plan:</h3>
<p>Ship the smaller perks as soon as they are available.</p>
<p>""Start cutting metal"" for the injection molding tools.</p>
<p>Build final circuit boards and verify that they meet our expectations (and hopefully yours).</p>
<p>Assemble and test several units from the production tools. We're big believers in testing and verifying everything we can so you get a quality product.</p>
<p>Ship finished cases to all of our supporters as soon as they are ready.</p>

<p>In South Africa we say ""Nothing for Mahala"", which means ""nothing is for free"".</p>
<p>Giving away something does not create value in what you giving. But, when you need to place some effort (no matter how small) into something, you tend to appreciate it more.</p>
<p>So, I developed the “Earn your Internet” where instead of having to pay for Internet, Email and Mobile Phone bills, we can help many reduce their costs, or make it 's payment, as obtainable as possible.</p>
<h2><em><strong>Why Earning is better than FREE<br/></strong></em></h2>
<p>Sugata Mitra in his video (hole in the wall)- <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRb7_ffl2D0"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRb7_ffl2D0</a> – explains how you can be in the middle of a metro and still be remote because of a lack of access to technology.</p>
<p>In Johannesburg we have areas like this in Tembisa:</p>
<p><img alt=""Just a picture of Temibsa"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i1343.photobucket.com/albums/o788/grantgray/image16_zps2b5f15a0.png"" src="""" style="""" title=""Tembisa""/></p>
<p>Tembisa is a typical Township with over 800,000 people living in it, most on the bread line or on the poverty line. There are around 47 of these in South Africa with around 6 to 8 Million (nobody knows exactly) people living there.</p>
<p>But in these areas if you install something for Free, not everyone appreciates it. In Africa you need to earn a mans respect before he will give it to you. It doesn't come for Free. The same goes with projects. Free doesnt do as well as something earned, making it more valueable.</p>
<h2><strong>The Basic concept of “Earn your Internet”</strong></h2>
<p>Dont pay, rather earn you Access. Do certain activites online and get free access because of this. And then pay the diffirence if there is one.</p>
<h2><strong>How will we deploy the Solution?</strong></h2>
<p>1 - 6 months - write the solution to manage everything by integrating already made solutions, which we will purchase where required.</p>
<p>3- 6 months - deploy the Wi-Fi hotspots and other solutions.</p>

<li>We can change lives;</li>
<li>We can uplift people;</li>
<li>We can improve lives;</li>
<li>We can create futures;</li>
</ul><p>I believe we can make a big difference if we focus our efforts on providing to the poor by using a smartly designed solution to create the income to support it.</p>
<h2><strong>But we need your help to raise $50,000<br/></strong></h2>
<p>Firstly <strong>we not a BIG Corporate</strong> with deep pockets. We a smaller ISP with a heart. We care. If we can make a diffirence we will. And I believe we can.</p>
<p>We need to write the system and we need to hire programmers to do this.Then we need to hire and train technicians to install Wi-Fi equipment.</p>
<p>We forsee the costs of this project to segment in the following way:</p>

We plan on doing some basic banner advertising on other apps by using platforms like Flurry

Upgrade the SDKs we're using to the current iOS8, iPhone6 and XCode6 requirements

Risks & Challenges

  
Unfortunately, problems arise from almost every corner. That's why we have calculated the risks, also based on our experience with advertising Ulocal and making timely app updates with no bugs. We would like to share them with you...
Marketing


We already know the costs of promoting Ulocal through travel blogs and we have received many websites availability. The only risk is a short time delay in case they are promoting some other product or service.
Advertising on other apps through platforms like Flurry might turn out to be more costly than we expect. We have only used Facebook ads so far and we will have to test Flurry and eventually raise more funds to use it properly. 

Upgrades


Upgrading our app and SDKs should go smooth. We might need to do further upgrades if some new SDK comes around, for example one that improves our worldwide calling feature.
The time to renew our graphics will only depend on how quickly we can pull off new designs that make Ulocal both attractive and easy-to-use for our users.

<p>
		International Sliver Stick Hockey was the brainchild of Mr. Jack 
Kinsella. It germinated while attending a friendly exhibition game in 
Potsdam, New York between the Bantam Woodroffe Cardinals from Ottawa 
West and the Bantam Potsdam Golden Knights in November, 1956. After 
watching his son play for Woodroffe, Jack Kinsella decided a return 
match should be setup to promote the game and foster “goodwill” between 
the two countries. There was little ice available in Ottawa so Jack 
looked to Richmond, Ontario, just west of Ottawa.  Richmond had one of
 the very few indoor rinks at that time. For the full story click the link below<br/></p>

<p>One morning while preparing breakfast for my seven-year-old, my next door neighbor knocked on my door and said ""your car's being towed."" I rushed outside to find my car being attached to a tow truck. I asked the driver why my car was being taken and he informed me it was for outstanding parking tickets. I said that was impossible since I had gotten only one parking ticket in the last year. He went to his truck and returned with paperwork showing that my car had seven outstanding parking tickets, and off he went with my car. (My ex-roommate had gotten six parking tickets in nine days while I was out of town and never said a word to me. She had moved out by the time the ""tow truck"" incident occurred).</p>
<p>Five hours and $1,416 later...I got my car back.</p>
<p>Everyone has a neighbor that they don't really know who you wave and say good morning to on your way to your car every morning, right. Well, I have Brian. The next morning Brian finally introduced himself and told me, ""I heard a parking enforcement officer request a tow truck yesterday morning, but he was told that a truck wasn't available for over an hour. I wanted to call you or knock on your door to let you know, but I didn't know where you live."" If Brian had been able to contact me it would have saved me a great deal of money.</p>
<h2>
<br/>That's When NoTicketForMe Started! </h2>
<p>The dislike of parking tickets is universal to most of us, particularly in the larger cities around the country where we have so many more types of parking tickets to contend with on a daily basis. The most notable being the ""street cleaning ticket,"" where all vehicles must be removed from a certain portion of the street by a specific time. For parking enforcement officials these tickets are like shooting fish in a barrel. If your vehicle should be moved by 8:00 a.m. you can rest assured that by 8:03 a.m. your vehicle will have a  parking ticket. I can't tell you how many times I have walked outside at 7:56 a.m. and have seen multiple vehicles that I know are going to end up with a parking ticket in the next few minutes. I would love to have been able to warn them.</p>
<p>So we at NoTicketForMe.com came up with an alternative.</p>

<p>The <a href=""http://whitewright.lib.tx.us/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Whitewright Public Library</a> was founded in 1967 and run by volunteers. In 1978, it moved to its current location and officially became a department of the City of Whitewright and was also accredited by the Texas State Library and Archives Commission. We primarily serve Grayson and Fannin Counties (approximately one-hour north of Dallas, Texas), with no charge for a library card.</p>
<p>Despite being in a rural area, we have a history of using technology in the library as soon as possible. We switched from a card catalog to a computerized catalog in the early 1990s and provided public access computers by the mid-1990s, when dial-up was the only Internet option. We now have our catalog online (also available for mobile devices), public access computers with broadband, and public WiFi.</p>
<p>Our users have been requesting e-books, and after much research, the <a href=""http://netldc.lib.overdrive.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Northeast Texas Libraries Digital Collection</a> is our best option. This is a consortium of several libraries using the popular OverDrive system, which has both e-books and digital audiobooks. This will allow our small library to join a much larger digital world, with access to hundreds of titles.</p>
<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<p>The annual fee is $1,500, with a three-year total of $4,500. A three-year contract is required to join.</p>
<p>At the $25 level, you will receive a thank you card from the library’s advisory board. Donors will also be listed on the library’s website and in the town newspaper.</p>
<p>At the $100 level, you have a choice between our library’s ""Hometown Favorites"" cookbook or a reprint edition of ""Murder at the Corners"" by G.B. Ray. The cookbook was compiled by library volunteers and supporters, with a wide variety of recipes.</p>
<p>""Murder at the Corners"" chronicles what is referred to as the <a href=""http://www.legendsofamerica.com/tx-leepeacock.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Lee-Peacock Feud</a> in North Texas during the Reconstruction period after the Civil War. Ms. Ray was a leader in founding our library and left the printing rights to us as a way to continue supporting the library.</p>
<p>If we do not reach our goal, the library’s advisory board will do further fundraising locally until the goal of $4,500 is met.</p>
<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<p>Adding e-content to the library’s collection will allow our users access from e-readers or smartphones, without taking up more shelf space, and provide a greater breadth of knowledge than we would be able to have with just our physical collection. We currently are at our limits to add new materials, so having access to older materials in e-format will allow us to have more space on our shelves.</p>
<p>We hope that a digital library will especially benefit our homebound users and those with vision issues. With an eReader, they can check out books from home, and make the text larger. In some cases, eReaders can read the text in an automated voice. Due to our limited budget and space, we are unable to keep our large print and audiobook collections as up-to-date as we’d like.</p>
<p>We have received many grants for projects in the past. Our most recent was a $4,500 grant from <a href=""http://tocker.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">The Tocker Foundation</a> to purchase print and audio/video materials for our Young Adult collection. This ends September 30, 2012, with over 300 items purchased.</p>
<p>Though we are a City library, we only receive funds for one full-time and one part-time employee, plus the space for the library and utilities paid.

<p></p>
<p><span><b>Four reasons to support Raymio and get your own wearable UV sensor:</b></span></p>
<ul>
<li><p><b>Protect your skin and eyes:</b> UV radiation causes permanent damage</p></li>
<li><p><b>Worry less and learn:</b> know exactly when &amp; how you should protect yourself</p></li>
<li><p><b>Help protect others:</b> share and care with friends and family through our app </p></li>
<li><p><b>Donate your exposure data to cancer research: </b>science needs knowledge!</p></li>
</ul>
<p><span>You probably know that ultraviolet (UV) radiation causes premature aging of your skin. But did you know that sunburns are a serious health risk? When your skin peels off after a sunburn, it’s a part of your largest organ shedding off to avoid that DNA damage within it results in skin ailments like melanoma. As you accumulate exposure, risks increases - even if you don't get sunburned. You want to keep your UV levels with a healthy range. If you live an active lifestyle, monitoring this represents a serious challenge. That’s why you need Raymio!</span></p>

If the campaign is not succesful all funds will be returned. So help us make it!RAYMIO IS 360° SUN SAFETY

Four reasons to support Raymio and get your own wearable UV sensor:

Protect your skin and eyes: UV radiation causes permanent damage
Worry less and learn: know exactly when & how you should protect yourself
Help protect others: share and care with friends and family through our app 
Donate your exposure data to cancer research: science needs knowledge!

You probably know that ultraviolet (UV) radiation causes premature aging of your skin. But did you know that sunburns are a serious health risk? When your skin peels off after a sunburn, it’s a part of your largest organ shedding off to avoid that DNA damage within it results in skin ailments like melanoma. As you accumulate exposure, risks increases - even if you don't get sunburned. You want to keep your UV levels with a healthy range. If you live an active lifestyle, monitoring this represents a serious challenge. That’s why you need Raymio!
We know that getting sun safety right isn’t easy. That's why we’ve created the world's most advanced UV wearable.
YOUR DAY WITH RAYMIO










Raymio registers your UV A+B exposure and offer personalized protection according to your skin type. It helps you prevent excessive exposure which can cause sunburn and other UV related discomforts by advising you when to put on sun lotion, seek shade and which types of clothes you should wear.
COFINANCED BY THE DANISH GOVERNMENT 


For every dollar you support us with, the Danish Market Development Fund gives us three!

We have to report to the fund until the final product is developed and delivered to you. This is your guarantee that we will deliver if we reach our goal!Raymio has been thoroughly vetted: our participation in this programme requires rigorous screening of our company and product development.  We're also supported by Innovation Fund Denmark and the Danish Foundation For Entrepreneurship.



HOW IT WORKS

The Raymio App will send you a notification on days when the UV index is high and remind you to wear the device. 


Raymio store data and send continuous updates about your sun exposure to the mobile app
throughout the day. To ensure accuracy, the unit utilizes
internal directional sensors to estimate the sensors’ position in relation to
the sun. We call this feature 360° Sun Safety. To create a fail-safe, we
have partnered with the Danish Meteorological Institute, who provides us with UV
index satellite data. Even if your Raymio sensor doesn’t face the sun, it will
not presume that you are not exposed to sunlight: our algorithms will
compensate for temporary drops in input or a downturned position.

THE RAYMIO COLORS







Select the wristband color
you like the most. The finished wristband will be moulded in thermoplastic
elastomers (TPE). The material is non-allergic and very comfortable against the
skin. Our current protoype is sand casted, so it looks a lot rougher than a
final product. We offer our early bird backers a black wristband. Backers who
pick another reward can choose between between three more colors: white, yellow
and blue.

Each bring a wide range of experience, enthusiasm and professional networks to Raymio. We’re working hard to bring Raymio to you!

2016:
MARCH (expected): Raymio ships to backers!


We hope you would like to support us! We would certainly like you to be wearing Raymio in 2016. And please share our campaign with friends and family! Together we can get sun safety the spot it deserves.
Risks and challenges

Producing a hardware product is not easy and unforeseen risks can occur. Plenty of crowdfunded electronic products have certainly gone off-track in the manufacturing phase. We’re doing our best to anticipate risks. Raymio will be a sophisticated piece of technology and sometimes even the big players mess up in creating and scaling hardware products. But we have two huge advantages. Our technical team is led by senior professionals with more than 25 years experience in developing and manufacturing state of the art electronics. We have entered a manufacturing agreement prior to the Kickstarter campaign. This means that we won’t be spending precious time finding a manufacturing partner after a successful crowdfunding round. Our engineers have been working with the manufacturer multiple times over the past decade and can guarantee their timeliness and production quality. Our match-funding agreement with The Danish Market Development Fund means that crowdfunding funds will be amended with a substantial amount. This ensures that we will not run out of funds before we have delivered rewards to our backers.PressContact: hello@raymio.comPLEASE NOTE: Raymio is not a medical device and should not be used to diagnose or treat any medical condition.

<p></p> <p>We at <a href=""http://www.pledgetosarah.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Pledge to Sarah</a> are dedicated to making our industry safer for everyone. Long hours, dangerous conditions and poor planning can result in on-set safety issues that are rarely reported. We are raising money to build a free app that will give filmmakers anonymous instant access to safety hotlines where safety issues and excessive hours can be reported. While these hotlines already exist they are sadly under utilized. The app will allow quick and simple access to the hotlines and will automatically use a caller ID block to provide complete anonymity when reporting an issue. The app will also give users the ability to submit copies of timecards (with personal info redacted) showing long hours. This anecdotal information will help our unions and guilds fight for safer working hours while maintaining a livable wage and benefitting us all. </p>

<h3>Who We Are &amp; Why We Care</h3>
<div>We are a dedicated group of filmmakers, many of whom knew Sarah Jones. Sarah lost her life while working on an unsafe film set on February 20, 2014.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>She was 27. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>We believe that through increased vigilance and a better awareness of the safety tools that are available to us all, our sets can be safer and our fellow crew members can be assured of arriving home safely at the end of every day. We created the site <a href=""http://www.pledgetosarah.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Pledge to Sarah</a>  and are creating this app because we believe that no one should ever lose their life because of a film production. Whether it is an on-set safety issue or an exhausted drive home at the end of a long day we all need to speak up and be heard.<br/>

</tbody></table><p>Do you use RAMPS for your 3D printer?
Wouldn't it be better, to have an efficient, smart and simple
solution, which can drive even more powerful motors?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Our goal is to build a first series of
the Beta Arduino Mega (BAM) shield with suitable drivers for 3D
printers. They will be precise and powerful, capable to drive big and
fast machines. The possibility for efficient cooling and
extendibility will be ensured by the clever design of the Dynamic and
Interchangeable Controller Extensions (DICEs). The project will be
completely open source and will be licensed as open hardware.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The complete BAM shield with
four different DICEs and the Arduino Mega.<br/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/461173/files/20140326052135-BAM_DICE-assembled.jpg?1395836495"" src="""" style=""width: 557.39px; height: 464px;""/></p>The main feature on the BAM shield is the connector,
based on the cost efficient and space saving PCI-E hardware.  It
provides more contacts and thus, the DICEs can draw more current and
can provide many different functions. The design is 100% compatible
with the RAMPS for RepRap, so all commonly used 3D printer firmwares
can be used unmodified. The first DICE, intended for 3D printers,
will be the DICE-STK, which can drive up to 3 Amps and will offer up to 128 times substepping. <br/><p>
</p><p>Please help us to fund our first series
of this breakthrough enhancement. We need your help to reach the
minimum amounts for a reasonable price.</p><p>For 100 pieces of fully assembled BAM
shields with five DICE-STKs we need 10'000 € for production. If we
don't reach this amount, we will produce smaller quantities, and in
extreme cases, we will solder them by ourself to keep the costs at a
minimum.</p>
<p>

compatible with the well known and commonly used RAMPS, you can
choose freely from the wide variety of already existing software
solutions. The community offers a lot of firmwares for 3D printers,
which you can use without modifications on the BAM shield with
standard stepper motor DICEs. 

<p>
</p><p>For all other DICEs we will provide
examples and Arduino libraries to allow quick and easy use for your
projects.

prototypes. With the BAM shield together with DICE-STK we are ready to produce the first
series, intended for 3D printers. Many additional DICE boards are in
development and it depends on the funding, how much we can realize.

</p><p>Verwenden Sie auch das RAMPS aus der
RepRap Gemeinde? Wäre es nicht vorteilhaft, eine leistungsstarke und
flexible Lösung für 3D Drucker zu haben, die noch stärkere Motoren
betreiben kann?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unser Ziel ist es, eine erste Serie des Beta Arduino Mega (BAM) mit geeigneten Endstufen für 3D-Drucker zu bauen. Sie werden präzise und kraftvoll und in der Lage sein, große und schnelle Maschinen zu betreiben.
Die Möglichkeit für eine effiziente Kühlung und die Erweiterbarkeit wird durch die clevere Konstruktion der „Dynamic and Interchangable Controller
Extensions“ (DICE) gewährleistet werden. Das Projekt wird komplett Open Source sein und wird als offene Hardware lizenziert werden. 
</p>
<p>
</p>Komplettes BAM Shield mit vier verschiedenen DICE Modulen und einem Arduino Mega.

Neu auf dem BAM Shield sind die Stecker für die DICE Boards, basierend auf der kostengünstigen und platzsparenden PCI-E-Technik. Sie bietet
mehr Kontakte und somit können die DICEs mehr Strom beziehen und viele verschiedene Funktionen abdecken. Das Design ist 100% kompatibel mit den RAMPS für RepRap, so dass alle gängigen 3D-Drucker Firmwares unverändert
genutzt werden können. Das erste DICE, spezialisiert für den 3D-Drucker,
wird der DICE-STK sein, ein leistungsstarkes Modul, das bis zu 3 Ampere
(RMS) und bis zu 128-faches Substepping unterstützt.<br/><p>
</p><p>Bitte helfen Sie uns, die erste Serie dieser bahnbrechenden Erweiterung zu finanzieren. Wir brauchen Ihre Hilfe, um die Mindestmengen zu erreichen und eine günstige Produktion zu ermöglichen.

</p><p>
</p><p>Für 100 Stück der komplett montierten und betriebsbereiten BAM Shields mit fünf DICE-STKs brauchen wir 10'000 €. Wenn wir diesen Betrag
nicht erreichen, werden wir kleinere Mengen produzieren, und in extremen Fällen werden wir sie von Hand löten, um die Herstellungskosten auf ein Minimum zu reduzieren.</p>
<p></p>

<p>
</p>
<p>Da das BAM Shield vollständig kompatibel zum bekannten und weit verbreiteten RAMPS Board ist, können Sie frei aus der Vielzahl von bereits bestehenden Software-Lösungen wählen. Die Fangemeinde bietet eine Menge Firmware für 3D-Drucker, die Sie ohne Änderungen auf dem BAM Shield
mit den Standard-Schrittmotor-DICEs verwenden können.

</p>
<p>Auf dem BAM Modul sind - ähnlich dem RAMPS - drei Temperatureingänge für NTCs, sechs digitale Eingänge für End-Schalter und die  Hochstromschalter integriert. Andere Optionen (z. B. Anschlüsse für Displays, SD-Karten-Erweiterungen und Bluetooth-Module) können angelötet
werden, abhängig von der geplanten Verwendung. Die Platine selbst ist aus FR4 mit vier Lagen Kupfer, die jeweils 35 um dick sind.<br/></p><b>Spezifikation:</b><br/><ul>

des Substepping verwendeten, MS1 bis MS3-Eingängen eingestellt.</p>
<p>Zwei Feedback-Kanäle dienen speziellen Anwendungen der erweiterten DICE Module und können individuell auf die Bedürfnisse der Nutzer angepasst werden. Mit den Kommunikationssignalen (I2C, SPI, serielle
Schnittstelle) auf dem PCI-E-Steckerkann man ICs für viele gängige
Anwendungen ansteuern, wodurch vielseitigste Möglichkeiten entstehen.</p>

Für eine optimale Anordnung stehen die DICE Module aufrecht im BAM Shield. Dies ermöglicht eine äußerst effiziente Kühlung, wenn ein
zusätzlicher Lüfter quer dazu angebracht wird. 

<p>Für alle Module sind die Montagebohrungen an der gleichen Stelle
vorgesehen, sodass eine einheitliche Verschaubung mit der umgebenden
Mechanik gewährleistet ist. Die maximale Dicke eines DICE beträgt
11.2mm (inkl. PCB), sodass die Module sich nicht gegenseitig

Do you use RAMPS for your 3D printer?
Wouldn't it be better, to have an efficient, smart and simple
solution, which can drive even more powerful motors?

Our goal is to build a first series of
the Beta Arduino Mega (BAM) shield with suitable drivers for 3D
printers. They will be precise and powerful, capable to drive big and
fast machines. The possibility for efficient cooling and
extendibility will be ensured by the clever design of the Dynamic and
Interchangeable Controller Extensions (DICEs). The project will be
completely open source and will be licensed as open hardware.

The complete BAM shield with
four different DICEs and the Arduino Mega.The main feature on the BAM shield is the connector,
based on the cost efficient and space saving PCI-E hardware.  It
provides more contacts and thus, the DICEs can draw more current and
can provide many different functions. The design is 100% compatible
with the RAMPS for RepRap, so all commonly used 3D printer firmwares
can be used unmodified. The first DICE, intended for 3D printers,
will be the DICE-STK, which can drive up to 3 Amps and will offer up to 128 times substepping. 
Please help us to fund our first series
of this breakthrough enhancement. We need your help to reach the
minimum amounts for a reasonable price.For 100 pieces of fully assembled BAM
shields with five DICE-STKs we need 10'000 € for production. If we
don't reach this amount, we will produce smaller quantities, and in
extreme cases, we will solder them by ourself to keep the costs at a
minimum.




As the BAM shield is completely
compatible with the well known and commonly used RAMPS, you can
choose freely from the wide variety of already existing software
solutions. The community offers a lot of firmwares for 3D printers,
which you can use without modifications on the BAM shield with
standard stepper motor DICEs. 


For all other DICEs we will provide
examples and Arduino libraries to allow quick and easy use for your
projects. 


We already made some functional
prototypes. With the BAM shield together with DICE-STK we are ready to produce the first
series, intended for 3D printers. Many additional DICE boards are in
development and it depends on the funding, how much we can realize. 


Take a look at the hardware and feel
free to send us comments and suggestions.
This is the beautiful BAM
shield, based on the RAMPS board.	Similar
to RAMPS - the three temperature inputs for NTCs, six digital inputs
for end-stops and the high current switches are integrated.
Other options (e. g. connectors for displays, SD card modules and
bluetooth devices) can be soldered, depending on the use. The print
is made of FR4 with four copper layers, each 35µm thick.Specification:
Supply voltage: 7V - 32V
Max. primary current for all DICEs: 15A
Max. secondary current for high current switch: 10A
DICE-Connector interface
(X axis) on the BAM shield:
The eight I/O signals are
used for the standard DICEs, DICE-STK and DICE-A4988, which makes it
completely compatible to RAMPS. The EN signal for each slot is also
used for the chip select signal in SPI applications.
The I²C Adresses of I²C-DICEs are set by the MS1..MS3 inputs, jumpered  on the BAM shield.
Two feedback channels can be
used for special applications. With the
communication signals (I2C, SPI, serial interface) on the PCI-E
connector it can handle applications with many common ICs, and many options are possible.For the optimum arrangement, the
DICE modules stand upright in the BAM shield. This enables extremely
efficient
cooling when an additional fan is mounted on them. For
all the modules the mounting
holes are
provided at the same position
so that a good
fit is guaranteed with possible enclosures.
The maximum thickness of a DICE is 11.2mm (including the PCB) so that the
modules do not interfere with each other.

For
the integration into your own circuits, we will provide two different
PCB sizes in a open Eagle-library, free for use.
DICE-STK

The DICE-STK includes the highly
integrated stepper driver STK682-010-E with 128 times substepping and
the module has trimmers for current setting and decay control.  To attach
different motors you don't need special connectors, because of the
practical plug, integrated also on other DICE boards. It allows  direct
connection of solid and stranded wires from AWG18 to AWG24.
For demanding applications additional
cooling hardware can be mounted. 

Specifications:
Logic voltage: 5V
Supply voltage: 9V - 35V
Current: 2.4A RMS  (3 A max.)
Size: 51 x 43 mm
DICE-A4988
This DICE comes with the famous Allegro
A4988, which is also used on the Pololu stepper drivers. Due to the
bigger PCB with backside cooling area it can handle bigger currents
and is less error-prone.

Specifications:
Logic voltage: 5V
Supply voltage: 8V - 35V 
Current: 1.4A RMS (2.1A max.)
Size: 51 x 30 mm
DICE-L6470PD

The L6470PD in the heat dissipating POWERSO36 package on this
DICE is controlled via SPI and is capable of driving high currents like
DICE-STK, also with 1/128 substepping. It has an additional output
for stall-detection and supports various options for intelligent
stepper motor driving. Due to the versatility of the IC, there exist many possibilities to implement your application.
Specifications:
Logic voltage: 5V
Supply voltage: 8V - 35V 
Current: 3A RMS (7A max.)
Size: 51 x 44 mm 
DICE-9555
This I/O expander DICE is controlled
via I²C and offers 16 additional I/Os. An interrupt signal can be used to
communicate signal changes back to the connected controller. The 20Way
Harting connector simplifies the connection of additional
electronics via a ribbon cable.
Specifications: 
Logic Voltage:  5V
Current: max. 200mA
I²C addresses: 32d .. 39d (100000b .. 100111b)
Size: 51x31 mm
DICE-Adapter

The DICE to bread board adapter allows
simple use and testing of the DICEs connected to an Arduino or to
your dedicated controller. With it, it is possible to use the full
capabilities of the DICE boards in several applications.
Specifications:
Size: 49 x 30 mm
Connectors: 2.54mm (0.1 inch)

DICE-VN

The heart of the DICE-VN is the VN808CM-E from STM. The DICE will be controlled via the I²C bus and allows the connection of up to eight valves or other
loads. The board is currently not populated, but the design has been
tested successfully in other applications. We will provide an update
as soon as possible.

Specifications:
Logic voltage: 5V
Supply voltage: 10.5 - 35V
Current: 0.7A per load (approx. 5A in sum)
I²C- Addresses: 112d .. 115d (111000b .. 111011b)
Size: 51 x 44 mm
DICE-TC

The DICE-TC is intended to amplify thermocouple signals,
convert them into digital data and make them available by
SPI. As space is limited, we can only estimate the number of
thermocouples per DICE at the moment. We intend to integrate up to
four thermocouple sensors per DICE board. Since this DICE module is still under development, we will give you an update about the specifications, when we have reached further progress. 

DICE-PSD

To be backwards compatible, on this DICE you will be able to mount the existing Pololu stepper drivers. It is not manufactured at the moment, thus we can only show the planned layout from EAGLE.


Together we can make this project a great success and realize the BAM Shields alongside with the DICE boards.The product will
give the Maker community the ability to equip
machines with a cost-effective and flexible controller. With
emphasis on easy installation, programming and
maintenance it will be really easy to use.
In addition, the products will help even novice users to use powerful
and precise machines, based on this
concept.Technicians, hobbyists,
engineers, small businesses and other manufacturers will benefit
from it. Further,
we want to share our knowledge and experiences with this campaign.
All schematics and layout will be provided under an open hardware license free for all. All developed software and the
corresponding source code will be available as a free download.The
actual applications for the BAM -Shield with the DICE boards are
primarily 3D printers,
milling machines, laser
cutters and paste
printers.In the
future we will also develop new DICE boards, such as analog modules
and bus-compatible extensions, to get the widest possible uses. Our
future focus lies on
core areas such as robotics, pick&place machines, valve and flap control, liquid handling and other applications.With
our previous developments (e.g. the Echinus board → www.echinus.org
) and our continuous commitment to the RepRap community since 2010,
we are perfectly qualified and highly motivated to support
you with excellent products in this practical system. 
Please
help us fund this project. We offer many
different perks, from which you can choose the most suitable. Even
small amounts are well invested and will strengthen our commitment.
You will let us know, that you support us and there
is a strong community behind our concept. 


Even if you are
not able to spend any money, you can help us by spreading the word.
Share it on social
networks, by using the indiegogo sharing tools and telling your
friends about our project.

Verwenden Sie auch das RAMPS aus der
RepRap Gemeinde? Wäre es nicht vorteilhaft, eine leistungsstarke und
flexible Lösung für 3D Drucker zu haben, die noch stärkere Motoren
betreiben kann?

Unser Ziel ist es, eine erste Serie des Beta Arduino Mega (BAM) mit geeigneten Endstufen für 3D-Drucker zu bauen. Sie werden präzise und kraftvoll und in der Lage sein, große und schnelle Maschinen zu betreiben.
Die Möglichkeit für eine effiziente Kühlung und die Erweiterbarkeit wird durch die clevere Konstruktion der „Dynamic and Interchangable Controller
Extensions“ (DICE) gewährleistet werden. Das Projekt wird komplett Open Source sein und wird als offene Hardware lizenziert werden. 


Komplettes BAM Shield mit vier verschiedenen DICE Modulen und einem Arduino Mega.

Neu auf dem BAM Shield sind die Stecker für die DICE Boards, basierend auf der kostengünstigen und platzsparenden PCI-E-Technik. Sie bietet
mehr Kontakte und somit können die DICEs mehr Strom beziehen und viele verschiedene Funktionen abdecken. Das Design ist 100% kompatibel mit den RAMPS für RepRap, so dass alle gängigen 3D-Drucker Firmwares unverändert
genutzt werden können. Das erste DICE, spezialisiert für den 3D-Drucker,
wird der DICE-STK sein, ein leistungsstarkes Modul, das bis zu 3 Ampere
(RMS) und bis zu 128-faches Substepping unterstützt.
Bitte helfen Sie uns, die erste Serie dieser bahnbrechenden Erweiterung zu finanzieren. Wir brauchen Ihre Hilfe, um die Mindestmengen zu erreichen und eine günstige Produktion zu ermöglichen.


Für 100 Stück der komplett montierten und betriebsbereiten BAM Shields mit fünf DICE-STKs brauchen wir 10'000 €. Wenn wir diesen Betrag
nicht erreichen, werden wir kleinere Mengen produzieren, und in extremen Fällen werden wir sie von Hand löten, um die Herstellungskosten auf ein Minimum zu reduzieren.




Da das BAM Shield vollständig kompatibel zum bekannten und weit verbreiteten RAMPS Board ist, können Sie frei aus der Vielzahl von bereits bestehenden Software-Lösungen wählen. Die Fangemeinde bietet eine Menge Firmware für 3D-Drucker, die Sie ohne Änderungen auf dem BAM Shield
mit den Standard-Schrittmotor-DICEs verwenden können. 


Für alle anderen DICE Module werden wir Beispiele und Arduino-Bibliotheken bereitstellen, die Ihnen eine schnelle und einfache Integration in Ihre Projekte ermöglichen.

Wir haben bereits einige funktionale Prototypen gefertigt. Mit dem DICE-STKs sind wir bereit, die erste Serie für 3D-Drucker zu produzieren. Viele zusätzliche DICE-Boards sind in der Entwicklung und es hängt von der
Finanzierung ab, wie viel wir davon zusätzlich realisieren können.

Werfen Sie einen Blick auf die unten aufgeführte Hardware.
Wir freuen uns über Ihre Kommentare und Anregungen.

Dies ist das hübsche BAM Shield – basierend auf dem RAMPS.

Auf dem BAM Modul sind - ähnlich dem RAMPS - drei Temperatureingänge für NTCs, sechs digitale Eingänge für End-Schalter und die  Hochstromschalter integriert. Andere Optionen (z. B. Anschlüsse für Displays, SD-Karten-Erweiterungen und Bluetooth-Module) können angelötet
werden, abhängig von der geplanten Verwendung. Die Platine selbst ist aus FR4 mit vier Lagen Kupfer, die jeweils 35 um dick sind.Spezifikation:
Versorgungsspannung: 7 V - 32V
Max. Primärstrom für alle DICEs: 15A
Max. Sekundärstrom für Hochstromschalter: 10A

DICE-Schnittstelle (X-Achse) auf dem BAM-Shield:
:

Für die Standard-DICEs, DICE-STK und DICE-A4988 werden acht I/O-Signale
verwendet. 

Das EN-Signal für den jeweiligen Steckplatz wird auch für das Chip Select Signal der SPI-Anwendungen verwendet. Die Adresse eines I²C-angesteuerten DICE wird von den, ansonsten für die Konfiguration
des Substepping verwendeten, MS1 bis MS3-Eingängen eingestellt.
Zwei Feedback-Kanäle dienen speziellen Anwendungen der erweiterten DICE Module und können individuell auf die Bedürfnisse der Nutzer angepasst werden. Mit den Kommunikationssignalen (I2C, SPI, serielle
Schnittstelle) auf dem PCI-E-Steckerkann man ICs für viele gängige
Anwendungen ansteuern, wodurch vielseitigste Möglichkeiten entstehen.

Für eine optimale Anordnung stehen die DICE Module aufrecht im BAM Shield. Dies ermöglicht eine äußerst effiziente Kühlung, wenn ein
zusätzlicher Lüfter quer dazu angebracht wird. 

Für alle Module sind die Montagebohrungen an der gleichen Stelle
vorgesehen, sodass eine einheitliche Verschaubung mit der umgebenden
Mechanik gewährleistet ist. Die maximale Dicke eines DICE beträgt
11.2mm (inkl. PCB), sodass die Module sich nicht gegenseitig
behindern. 


Für die Integration eigener Schaltungen werden wir in einem ersten Schritt zwei verschiedene PCB-Größen als Eagle-Library zur Verfügung stellen.

DICE-STK


Das DICE-STK enthält den hoch integrierten Schrittmotor-Treiber-Baustein STK682-010-E, der 128-faches Substepping unterstützt.
Ausserdem enthält das Modul zwei Trimmer für die Strom-Einstellung und Decay-Kontrolle der Motorenentmagnetisierung. Um verschiedene Motoren anzuschließen benötigen Sie keine speziellen Anschlüsse, da ein praktischer Stecker auf allen DICE Boards integriert ist.
Er ermöglicht den direkten Anschluss von starren Leitern
und Litzen der Durchmesser AWG18 bis AWG24. Für anspruchsvolle Anwendungen kann am IC ein Kühlkörper montiert werden.

Ausgang für die Erkennung von Schrittverlusten und unterstützt
vielseitige Optionen für die intelligente Ansteuerung von Schrittmotoren.
Durch die Vielseitigkeit des IC sind den Möglichkeiten hier kaum
Grenzen gesetzt.Spezifikation:
Logikspannung: 5V

Versorgungsspannung: 8V - 35V

<p>The Lumenator is a revolutionary type of LED lighting for both Photo and Video. The Lumenator dual purpose light is softer (LEDNatural technology), thinner (.5"") , lighter (13 ounces) and more flexible (dual purpose) than any conventional LED photo or video light.

<p>Most pro LED photo and video lights are harsh and specular, unless diffused to within an inch of their life. Lumenator uses Patent Pending LEDNatural technology to produce the smoothest, most natural LED lighting you have ever seen. The Lumenator side-mounted LED lights are diffused multiple times before they light your subject. You won't get the typical squints, fake grins and hot spots that you get with conventional rear-mounted LED panels. In the case of the Lumenator, soft luscious light does not equal low power. Lumenator uses only high-grade Samsung daylight balanced LED chips rated at over 50 lumens per LED. In fact, Lumenator delivers almost as much power as a 300 watt incandescent bulb. These LED chips also have a high CRI (&gt;=84) providing natural and vivid color rendition.</p>

<p>Un design original qui ressemble à un petit galet  offrant la meilleure ergonomie et un touché que vous ne trouverez sur aucun autre produit.</p>
<p>Gablys est un concentré de technologie qui tient dans le creux de votre main ou au fond de votre poche.</p>

<p> Grâce à la création de barrières virtuelles (géofencing), dès que votre Gablys sort de la zone définie, votre smartphone vous alerte immédiatement.<br/><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Avec la dernière génération de puce Bluetooth basse consommation, vous pouvez surveillez, suivre et retrouver vos affaires n'importe où, n'importe quand.</span></p>

<p>Nous avons intégré plusieurs capteurs dont la détection de mouvement. Gablys devient un des tous premiers système d'alarme de mouvement que vous pouvez placer n'importe où. Vos affaires ont maintenant un chien de garde !</p>

<p>Nous avons optimisé le plus petit et sophistiqué buzzer disponible sur le marché. Ainsi vous pouvez entendre votre Gablys dès que vous le ferez sonner à proximité de vous.<br/> Avec ses 3 LED multicolores, vous pouvez retrouver votre Gablys dans les endroits les plus sombres. Ses effets de lumières lui donne un aspect très cool et funky.</p>

<p>Ergonomie, modernité et expérience utilisateur ont été les mots clés pour concevoir l'application mobile Gablys. Toutes les fonctionnalités doivent être aisément accessibles du bout du doigt. Par exemple, pour désactiver toutes les alertes de vos Gablys, un seul clique sur un bouton suffit. L'interface a été conçue pour être la plus ergonomique et fonctionnelle. Le design est dans la tendance des nouvelles applications avec les effets Parallax, Map, Géolocalisation, etc.</p>

<p>Nous savons qu'il peut arriver que nos objets soient réellement perdus. C'est pourquoi nous avons créé la communauté Gablys.
    Elle devient la plus grande communauté d'objets perdus sur mobile où chacun peut participer à retrouver des objets.
    Lorsque la communauté est alertée, elle vous informera où et quand votre objet a été vue pour la dernière fois. Et le cas échéant, elle pourra même vous le retrouver pour de vrai !
    <br/>
    L'application Gablys a été conçu dès le début pour être utilisée même si vous n'avez pas de Gablys. Téléchargez-là et vous devenez un <i>Gablys Guardian</i>.<br/>
    Si vous aidez quelqu'un a retrouver ses affaires, vous serez récompensés.<br/>
    Gablys App est la première solution virtuelle de recherche d'objets perdus récompensant ses utilisateurs.</p>

Cette campagne est disponible en Version Française  
This campaign is available inEnglish Version 



    Design, Intelligent et Utile. Le porte-clés antivol et anti-perte connecté à votre smartphone.


Gablys est un petit objet au design
épuré qui s'accroche aux affaires que vous souhaitez surveiller et ne plus perdre.
Vous êtes dans le train et vous ne pouvez pas surveiller votre valise ? Glissez-y un Gablys, dès qu’elle sera bougée, votre smartphone vous alertera immédiatement.Vous recherchez votre smartphone ?
Un appui sur le Gablys et votre smartphone se met à sonner même en mode
vibreur ou silencieux. Votre objet sort de la zone choisie ? Votre
smartphone et le Gablys vous alertent.
Aie ! Vous avez perdu votre objet.
Alertez la communauté, elle vous aidera à le retrouver. C’est retrouvé ?
Votre sauveur reçoit directement votre récompense.
N'êtes vous pas fatigués de toujours égarer vos affaires ou perdre du temps à les chercher ? 
    Qui n'a jamais vécu ou connu ce genre de situations ?""J'ai perdu les clés de ma voiture. Bonjour la facture !""""Mon téléphone est toujours planqué et je perds mon temps à le chercher.""""Tous les matins, j'oublie mon téléphone et je m'en rends compte une fois sur la route.""
    C'est pour cela que nous avons créé Gablys.

Après 2 ans de R&D, 6 mois de tests, plusieurs groupes de discussions avec des consommateurs, et plusieurs prototypes, nous sommes fiers et heureux de vous présenter notre création, Gablys. 
Un design original qui ressemble à un petit galet  offrant la meilleure ergonomie et un touché que vous ne trouverez sur aucun autre produit.
Gablys est un concentré de technologie qui tient dans le creux de votre main ou au fond de votre poche.

Fonctionnalités avancées


 Grâce à la création de barrières virtuelles (géofencing), dès que votre Gablys sort de la zone définie, votre smartphone vous alerte immédiatement.Avec la dernière génération de puce Bluetooth basse consommation, vous pouvez surveillez, suivre et retrouver vos affaires n'importe où, n'importe quand.

Nous avons intégré plusieurs capteurs dont la détection de mouvement. Gablys devient un des tous premiers système d'alarme de mouvement que vous pouvez placer n'importe où. Vos affaires ont maintenant un chien de garde !

Gablys fonctionne dans les deux sens de communication. Avec son bouton intégré, vous pouvez retrouver votre iphone ou votre smartphone android. Appuyez et votre téléphone sonne, même en mode silencieux ou vibreur !

Nous avons optimisé le plus petit et sophistiqué buzzer disponible sur le marché. Ainsi vous pouvez entendre votre Gablys dès que vous le ferez sonner à proximité de vous. Avec ses 3 LED multicolores, vous pouvez retrouver votre Gablys dans les endroits les plus sombres. Ses effets de lumières lui donne un aspect très cool et funky.
L'Application Gablys (Gablys App)

Ergonomie, modernité et expérience utilisateur ont été les mots clés pour concevoir l'application mobile Gablys. Toutes les fonctionnalités doivent être aisément accessibles du bout du doigt. Par exemple, pour désactiver toutes les alertes de vos Gablys, un seul clique sur un bouton suffit. L'interface a été conçue pour être la plus ergonomique et fonctionnelle. Le design est dans la tendance des nouvelles applications avec les effets Parallax, Map, Géolocalisation, etc.
Quelques fonctionnalités de Gablys App

Affichage du niveau de batterie
Alerte en cas de perte de connexion

*Les distances sont données à titre indicatif en extérieur et peuvent varier selon les interférences aux alentours.
La communauté Gablys
Nous savons qu'il peut arriver que nos objets soient réellement perdus. C'est pourquoi nous avons créé la communauté Gablys.
    Elle devient la plus grande communauté d'objets perdus sur mobile où chacun peut participer à retrouver des objets.
    Lorsque la communauté est alertée, elle vous informera où et quand votre objet a été vue pour la dernière fois. Et le cas échéant, elle pourra même vous le retrouver pour de vrai !
    
    L'application Gablys a été conçu dès le début pour être utilisée même si vous n'avez pas de Gablys. Téléchargez-là et vous devenez un Gablys Guardian.
    Si vous aidez quelqu'un a retrouver ses affaires, vous serez récompensés.
    Gablys App est la première solution virtuelle de recherche d'objets perdus récompensant ses utilisateurs.

<p>You want the equipment that spies have but might not have your own federal agency to issue you clandestine gadgets.  Well the Trace Case is your pathway to a more covert lifestyle.  It protects and tracks your valuables with the help of your smart or dumb phone.  Trace Case accepts any opportune cell.</p>
<p><img alt=""Text Case Open"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://tracecaseproducts.com/trace_case001015.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Case Opened""/></p>
<p>The Trace Case is basically a buddy you can text on your phone.   Just text it like you would a friend and it will interact with you on any phone you set it up with.  You now can ask your briefcase its location or have it open in some remote country without being around.  If you need someone else to carry your stuff but don't quite think you tipped them enough not to look inside your belongings, then the Trace Case is the box for you.</p>
<p><img alt=""Texting Case to Open"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://tracecaseproducts.com/trace_case_28nov2012_lean002019.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Opened Case""/></p>
<p>Trace Case is an easy way to keep people from messing with your stuff.  Just close it up and track it.  If someone decides to pick up your case, they will not be able to open it without your permission. You don't even have to be around to let them in.   Access, security, and traceability, are features that are under your control with Trace Case. </p>
<p><img alt=""Tracking the Trace Case"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://tracecaseproducts.com/trace_case_02dec2012_lean002001.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Trace the Case""/></p>
<p>As it stands right now, the case opens and closes through texting and the tracking capability is being developed as you read this.  There are a few methods we are contemplating to track this silver fox.  Many are familiar with GPS, which is one of the tracking methods we are using.  More sensors will come into later models to provide even tighter security for the armed guard in all of us.</p>

<p>We did not want to change anything in the cell phone world so the Trace Case acts like your phone does.  Just leave it on and charge it when you want to.  You can turn the case off when not in use.  The Case provides a day long charge or longer depending on how you use it.  We are working on improving battery management just so we squeeze every drop of energy out of our power sponge. Right now we use rechargeable batteries instead of a custom battery.  If you need to power a lifesaving device during a power out, you can take the case batteries - we understand.  All features are sealed within the case so nothing is left exposed for the prying eyes.  The seamless appearance of the aluminum skin leaves people curious as to the contents of this reflective container.   Just be sure to inform the inquiring minds that it is not stuffed with cash - even if it is.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Trace Case is not just an animated attache.  Trace Case is a safe.  It works to protect your things with only you knowing the combination, you knowing the whereabouts, and you being able to open it from up close or afar.  This adds another dimension to secure transport:  Now you can ship it or safeguard it, and feel good doing it.  </p>

<p>The technology inside is available to anyone that wants to apply Trace Case capabilities to other objects. We plan to have the hardware available in February. This will allow users to apply cell phone intelligence to move things or track things.  All you have to do is install and start texting. At the moment we do not provide scalability from the size of container we use now, but we plan to in the future.  Our current size can make boxes smarter that are the size of business briefcases.  The size can be applied to many different containers.</p>
<p><img alt=""Palpod Ports"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://tracecaseproducts.com/trace_case_02dec2012_lean002006.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Programming Ports""/></p>
<p>Palpod is our hardware platform inside the Trace Case and it is open for business to those that want to interact with objects in your environment.  We use a third party software for writing the code and flashing it inside the Palpod.  This third party software is free and downloadable off the internet with full documentation and plenty of examples.  The Palpod is connected via your USB port on your computer to an RS-232 port on the Palpod.  A cable is included with the Palpod to ease this process.   Set your ideas in motion by making stuff do things for you or interacting with each other.  Maybe the objects will get so smart they will be telling you what to do.  However advanced your objects get, Palpod can take you there.  The effectiveness of Palpod is that there are so many devices and everyday objects around us that would be so much cooler if they texted us and we could text them.  Those objects would do things we told them to do and we would do things for them.  For example, it would be nice to have my shoes text me if I was losing weight, or if my socks were about to get wet.  My wife wants her purse to be tracked if someone snatches it.  The possibilities are endless.  If you were jogging with your Palpod shoes on a trail with other joggers that had palpod technology inside their shoes, the situation would be awesome. What could happen is that when the lead jogger's shoes ran into sand, the the lead jogger's shoes could send a message to the following joggers' shoes that sand was approaching. The following joggers coming up on the sand could have their palpod shoelaces tighten to brace for the loose sand. Nice. That is just an idea for a possibility.  But an application that is a reality right now is our Trace Case.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Trace Case has many applications, but one application is transportation of valuables.  If you need someone else to take your items to another location, and you are unable to join the journey, the Trace Case can assist with your situation.  You can close the Trace Case around your contents by texting your case to ""Close"" and the Trace Case will close - in turn securing your items.  Now you just have to wait for your drop off.  </p>

With a switch to select between power bank mode and USB Hub mode, it is simple to activate USB hub function while minimizing power consumption.    USB-C Power Delivery technology allows devices to be charged at speeds previously unimagined in USB power supplies. X6 from Zendure provides up to 45W PD output, which means some of your favorite gadgets get the same or even better performance from X6 that you’d expect from their native chargers.For instance, X6 charges the iPhone 8, 8 Plus or iPhone X 300% faster than their original chargers, using an Apple USB-C to Lightning cable (not included with X6). X6 has an industry-leading 45W USB-C PD input & output. Despite its 20,000 mAh capacity, it can recharge itself in 3 hours if using a 45W PD charger, the fastest in the industry.With 20,000 mAh of charge storage, that 3 hour fill-up can get you pretty far. Most power banks on the market have one problem in common: they all have a minimum output ranging from 80 mAh to 150 mAh. Smaller devices, especially wearable devices, usually draw less current than that, causing a power bank to automatically shut off.X6 is the only USB-C power bank on the market that can charge an almost unlimited range of low-power devices such as smart watches, Bluetooth earphones, fitness bands, and much more. It's a great feature for the people who loves the outdoors, and have a lot of wearable devices to charge.  Simply press and hold the the power button for 3 seconds, X6 will enter X-Charge mode, and display the ""X"" icon. Press and hold  again to turn off X-charge mode. Now your wearable devices will never run out of power again in the wild. Another common problem with current power banks is that you cannot use them to power or charge other devices while the portable charger itself is being charged. Even some of them do, there's a short interruption of power when it enters the pass-through charging, causing the devices being charged to reboot and lose the data.Taking X6 one step further, we upgraded pass-through charging to include a UPS feature. There is no power interruption when X6 switches between pass-through and battery mode, making it ideal for applications such as security systems, micro-controllers, home automation, network storage, back-up power for Wifi-routers, and more.X6 even provides full-power output in pass-through mode and is not limited to the amount of input power provided. This allows you to charge X6 with a solar panel or dynamo while still getting maximum output performance. X6 is the only USB-C PD power bank that has 5 outputs, allowing you to charge up to 5 devices at the same time. The more, the merrier, isn't it? X6’s Digital LED Display lets you know exactly how much power is left. With high quality hardware components and an advanced safety system, X6 provides unparalleled protection to keep you and your devices safe. Convenience was a top priority in the design of X6. In order to provide ample room to access to all five charging ports and the LED display while avoiding wasted space, we arranged the six lithium-ion battery cells in a 2x3 configuration. This also provides an ideal profile for carrying by hand or stowing in a bag. In addition, we consolidated all of X6’s features into a single button for ease of use.Since X6 is capable of so much more than traditional power banks, it’s going to be seen in more places. Appearances matter, and no effort was spared when it came to X6.  The artful blending of curves and gentle ridges are in keeping with our recent Passport Travel Adaptor, whose design and features earned over seven thousand backers.Lightest 20,000 mAh PD Power Bank (Smallest, too.)By streamlining structural and electrical engineering, we have made X6 the lightest and smallest 20,000 mAh power bank on the market with Power Delivery, reaching the highest energy density among competitors. (See comparison chart below for details).   The Zendure 63W 4-port USB-C PD Charger is the perfect companion for X6. It features 1 USB-C port, 1 Quick Charge 3.0 port and 2 USB ports with Zen+. Charge your X6 or New MacBook and up to 3 other devices all in one place at the same time. The USB-C output delivers 45W power to recharges your X6 in just 3 hours. With 3 universal plugs for US, UK and EU,  you can enjoy a quick and convenient charge anywhere.    Zendure is a team of passionate consumer electronic engineers and designers. Our team members come from companies such as Apple, Huawei, Sennheiser, and Oppo, and have many combined years of experience in the field of consumer electronics.Our mission is to continue to design and innovate classic and reliable products to improve people’s lives. Our vision is to become the leader and best employer in the high-end consumer electronics market.Since 2013 we have earned our reputation by first delivering the Zendure A-Series crushproof external batteries, and then Passport, the world's first travel adapter with an auto-resetting fuse. X-Series is our new line of power banks and chargers that represent the latest charging technology in the market, with X6 being the first to debut in the family. We've listened to feedback from hundreds of thousands of our customers and fans worldwide. Adding features to X6 that no other companies would do, such as X-Charge™ and UPS features. It's designed for our customers, each and everyone of you. We can't wait to share this product with you, and that's why we are on Indiegogo again.      Risks and challengesHaving successfully launched two Kickstarter projects (the Zendure A-Series portable chargers, and the Zendure Passport). In the past few years, we have learned a lot in designing, prototyping, molding, and manufacturing of high-end consumer electronics. In 2015, we established an R&D office in the Pearl River Delta in China, the heart of manufacturing for electronics. Hired project managers, purchasing managers, engineers, and quality control personnel to oversee the whole process. Thus, we have more confidence in delivering a high-quality product. However, the risk still remains when it comes to a complicated project like X6 since we are using the world's most advanced and latest technologies. There's still unpredictability in terms of manufacturing. We will maintain constant and friendly communication to all of our backers as usual, and do our best to ensure the success of this project. FAQ1.

<h2>
<b style=""background-color: initial;"">Re-Lock, the bicycle lock that makes all other bicycle locks redundant</b><br/>
</h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>Unlock your
bicycle hands-free with Re-Lock, a revolutionary bicycle lock with an
electronic key. You keep the e-key in your pocket or bag. And that’s where it
stays. As soon as you get to your bike, the key and lock “communicate” with
each other radiographically to check whether they match. If so, the e-key transmits
a unique, unbreakable code to the lock, encrypted within a radiographic signal.
The lock shoots open within a fraction of a second. The key has not moved from
its position. You almost feel like James Bond. But how exactly does it work?</p><p><br/></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i.giphy.com/3ornkduRkd0P7VglQA.gif"" src="""" style=""""/><br/></p><p><br/></p><p>It works
as follows: the e-key is activated by an encrypted tone sent via a radiographic
signal, which then sends its unique code to the lock. The lock checks whether
the code is a match and if so, the lock opens. If not, it remains locked
securely.</p>
<p>The lock
and key switch off after every action, thus saving energy so that the
batteries last you a long time.</p><p><br/></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1456491914/cw3moqes5lwljwn2i7ar.png"" src="""" style=""""/><br/></p><br/><p>The
e-key does a great deal more besides: It always registers the latest status of
the lock. Is the lock open or closed? Handy to check, and particularly handy if
your bike has been stolen. That way, you can prove to your insurance provider
that you locked your bike. The lock is smart, it knows when it needs to carry
out a certain action and then switches to sleep mode: saving energy! You
replace the battery every three years and the key – being smart – warns you in
good time.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1457518449/n6d3s6fspstmajqjttvv.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><br/><h2>But first: the catalyst</h2>
<p></p><p>On a
rainy summer’s day I, Chiel Bekker, was sitting on a covered terrace. As usual,
bikes were parked everywhere around the terrace. A woman with a large bag appeared.
Once she got to her bicycle, she only found the bicycle key in that bag after
quite some time searching. She needed both hands to open the lock and had to
put her bag down in the wet street. She eventually climbed on her bicycle
drenched from the rain.</p><p><br/></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1456576936/xblkxuo6m6sy8zlnibru.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/>                     <br/></p>
<p></p><p>Shortly
afterwards, a man with an umbrella approached and he too first had to search
hard for the key while balancing the umbrella. After a few failed attempts to
open the lock with an open umbrella in his hand, he gave up. He had to close
the umbrella, he got wet in the rain, unlocked his bike, opened the umbrella
again and cycled off. The next victim was a young woman who walked to her bike
while talking on her phone. Sheclamped her smartphone
between her chin and shoulder, searched for her key, and tried to open the bike
lock with both hands. Slowly but surely, the phone slid out and crashed onto
the pavement.</p><p><br/></p><p>                 <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i.giphy.com/3ornjY8pK8CHoBiCkg.gif"" src="""" style=""""/><br/></p><p>                 </p>
<h2>The concept and its
development</h2>
<p></p><p>As an
experienced industrial designer and product developer, I thought ‘There has to
be a better way. Why are there no bicycle locks that open automatically when
you are an arm’s length away from your bike, for example?’ That notion remained
on my mind and after an extensive search on the internet, I came to the
conclusion that no such product existed yet. How is it possible? There are all
kinds of locks you can open with your smartphone or fingerprint, but even then,
you still need to use your hands.</p>
<p>In
collaboration with mechanical engineer Richard and electronics engineer George –
with whom I have already been working for twelve years – I started developing
the concept. This super handy bicycle lock is the result of those efforts. It’s
hard to understand why this has not been thought of before.</p><p></p><p></p><p>                                                  </p><p>                                          <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1456687206/kf7vtt69nxw61kzs9xlw.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 258px;height: 215px;""/></p><br/>
<p></p>
<h2>What is next?</h2>
<p></p>
<p></p><p>We have
established a crowdfunding initiative in order to produce this amazing Dutch
Design product. The lock will be certified so that you can be sure it meets all
requirements. It is also constructed in such a way that it is fully recyclable at
the same product level. Re-lock will be ART2 certified, this is accepted by all bicycle insurance companies.<br/></p><p></p><p>                                                         <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1457009542/vjvnikn1nst5qr0dobij.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 153px;height: 153px;""/></p><p><br/></p><p>You can register now for one of these awesome locks at a Super Early Cyclist price.

<p>We need
50,000 euros to start production (which will take place in the Netherlands). Because
although RE-Lock might look simple, it contains a great number of electronic
and mechanical components. On the images below you can see exactly what is involved.
Production tools need to be made in order to produce everything.</p>
<p>If we
exceed the target amount, we will use those funds to develop additional cool
gadgets, like a “find your bike” functionality, which helps locate your bike in

<p>Although Re-Lock is a young company, its management team has years of experience and a great deal of expertise in the field of product development, marketing and product launches.</p>
<p>Last year (2015), a team of three technicians devoted themselves entirely to the product development of the Re-Lock bicycle lock and that resulted in this incredible user-friendly, convenience-enhancing bicycle lock. Together with users of the bicycle lock, we aim, where possible, for continual improvement of the product with the input we hope to receive from users.</p>
<p>Another important aspiration is to develop and produce the product in the Netherlands: DUTCH DESIGN AND QUALITY.</p>

a unique, unbreakable code to the lock, encrypted within a radiographic signal.
The lock shoots open within a fraction of a second. The key has not moved from
its position. You almost feel like James Bond. But how exactly does it work?
It works
as follows: the e-key is activated by an encrypted tone sent via a radiographic
signal, which then sends its unique code to the lock. The lock checks whether
the code is a match and if so, the lock opens. If not, it remains locked
securely.
The lock
and key switch off after every action, thus saving energy so that the
batteries last you a long time.The
e-key does a great deal more besides: It always registers the latest status of
the lock. Is the lock open or closed? Handy to check, and particularly handy if
your bike has been stolen. That way, you can prove to your insurance provider
that you locked your bike. The lock is smart, it knows when it needs to carry
out a certain action and then switches to sleep mode: saving energy! You
replace the battery every three years and the key – being smart – warns you in
good time.But first: the catalyst
On a
rainy summer’s day I, Chiel Bekker, was sitting on a covered terrace. As usual,
bikes were parked everywhere around the terrace. A woman with a large bag appeared.
Once she got to her bicycle, she only found the bicycle key in that bag after
quite some time searching. She needed both hands to open the lock and had to
put her bag down in the wet street. She eventually climbed on her bicycle
drenched from the rain.                     
Shortly
afterwards, a man with an umbrella approached and he too first had to search
hard for the key while balancing the umbrella. After a few failed attempts to
open the lock with an open umbrella in his hand, he gave up. He had to close
the umbrella, he got wet in the rain, unlocked his bike, opened the umbrella
again and cycled off. The next victim was a young woman who walked to her bike
while talking on her phone. Sheclamped her smartphone
between her chin and shoulder, searched for her key, and tried to open the bike
lock with both hands. Slowly but surely, the phone slid out and crashed onto
the pavement.                                  
The concept and its
development
As an
experienced industrial designer and product developer, I thought ‘There has to
be a better way. Why are there no bicycle locks that open automatically when
you are an arm’s length away from your bike, for example?’ That notion remained
on my mind and after an extensive search on the internet, I came to the
conclusion that no such product existed yet. How is it possible? There are all
kinds of locks you can open with your smartphone or fingerprint, but even then,
you still need to use your hands.
In
collaboration with mechanical engineer Richard and electronics engineer George –
with whom I have already been working for twelve years – I started developing
the concept. This super handy bicycle lock is the result of those efforts. It’s
hard to understand why this has not been thought of before.                                                                                            

What is next?

We have
established a crowdfunding initiative in order to produce this amazing Dutch
Design product. The lock will be certified so that you can be sure it meets all
requirements. It is also constructed in such a way that it is fully recyclable at
the same product level. Re-lock will be ART2 certified, this is accepted by all bicycle insurance companies.                                                         You can register now for one of these awesome locks at a Super Early Cyclist price. Hurry, because only the first 100 submissions will qualify for the Super Early Cyclist rate.A brief

We need
50,000 euros to start production (which will take place in the Netherlands). Because
although RE-Lock might look simple, it contains a great number of electronic
and mechanical components. On the images below you can see exactly what is involved.
Production tools need to be made in order to produce everything.
If we
exceed the target amount, we will use those funds to develop additional cool
gadgets, like a “find your bike” functionality, which helps locate your bike in
crowded bike storage facilities, for example.


                                  What we need & what you getWe need your support to realise start of development and production Re-lock, in return we offer your the follow perks:                                 We are here to make your life easier


Although Re-Lock is a young company, its management team has years of experience and a great deal of expertise in the field of product development, marketing and product launches.
Last year (2015), a team of three technicians devoted themselves entirely to the product development of the Re-Lock bicycle lock and that resulted in this incredible user-friendly, convenience-enhancing bicycle lock. Together with users of the bicycle lock, we aim, where possible, for continual improvement of the product with the input we hope to receive from users.
Another important aspiration is to develop and produce the product in the Netherlands: DUTCH DESIGN AND QUALITY.

FAQ (Frequently asked questions)







Why an electronic key rather than simply using your smartphone?





1) Smartphones regularly have an empty battery, which would mean you then couldn’t open your lock. 2) Wi-Fi and Bluetooth signals are not at all secure and can be hacked from great distances. 3) With a smartphone, you have no proof your bicycle was locked for insurance purposes. 4) In rural areas, there are still many places with no or poor reception, leaving you high and dry. 5) You would not be able to lend anyone your bike without giving them your phone too, which is of course not very practical. 6) With a smartphone, you still need to undertake an action to instruct the lock to open, meaning you still need your hands to open the lock.










How long do the Re-Lock batteries ( 2XAA ) last?





At least 3 years with intensive use.








How do I know when the batteries are almost flat?





As soon as the batteries produce an insufficient charge, you receive a beep signal in good time. 








Can the lock close spontaneously while cycling?





No, the lock uses manual resilience by means of a child-safe lever. The electronics can only open the lock by means of an encrypted radio signal from the e-key.







What happens if I forget to lock my bike?




If the bike is unlocked, you get a signal (sound or vibration) as soon as you are over a meter away.








Does the lock work in all weather conditions?






Yes, the lock withstands cold, heat waves and heavy rain very well because the electronic components are completely enclosed.

Privacy. We don't want to think about it but we all know it's important. We have a right to privacy, that’s why we lock the bathroom door and use passwords.As convenient as our phones, tablets and laptops are, they can be hacked and the built-in cameras activated without our knowledge, allowing us to be viewed and recorded without our consent.With most of us working from home these days and frequently communicating via video chat, it is more important than ever to protect our privacy now.Facebook's CEO, a former FBI-director and many others have already made a habit of covering the cameras on their devices. And so should you!I searched for a product that would allow me to protect my privacy by disabling the cameras on all my devices but wasn't satisfied with what I found. The options I tested were either too permanent, bulky, generic or device specific.I wanted individually designed reusable camera stickers that fit perfectly on my phone, tablet, laptop and desktop computer. So I designed CamTag.  CamTag is a set of glue-free and reusable privacy stickers that help you protect your privacy by covering the cameras on phones, tablets, laptops and desktop computers.    CamTag is:
 glue-free and can be moved aside or removed without leaving residue 
 reusable an unlimited number of times
a set of 25 stickers that come in 5 sizes to fit on the built-in cameras on phones, tablets, laptops and desktop computers 
available in 25 beautiful designs 
customizable with your own design or branding 
  Each CamTag is printed in the highest possible resolution and vibrant colors.     CamTags are glue-free and allow for easy removal and unlimited reuse. CamTags fit on all phones, tablets, laptops and screens equipped with a built-in camera. The packaging folds to a square with the same height as your credit card so it easily fits in your wallet or pocket. A CamTag set contains 25 privacy stickers in 5 sizes. All CamTags will be equipped with a transparent protective layer to make them even more durable and ensure they look great even after heavy usage.             We will send a survey to the email associated with your Kickstarter account on June 25th using the CrowdOx pledge manager system. You will be able to choose your designs, order extras and provide your shipping information at that time. If you change addresses before we ship your rewards, you will be able to access your survey at this link anytime after June 25th.    Volker Lobmayr is the founder and designer of tabtag – glowing and reusable MacBook stickers – based in Vienna, Austria. In 2014 he successfully launched this design product via a Kickstarter campaign that got funded at over 200%. Since then Volker has been running tabtag full time, building an extensive design collection and manufacturing custom branded tabtags for companies all over the world. In 2016 he launched opaque tabtags optimized for the new MacBook models that are no longer equipped with a glowing apple logo.  Visit tabtag to learn more.  glowing vs. opaque tabtag     Thank you! I'd like to thank each of you for your support and feedback on CamTag. Special thanks to:

<p></p>
<p><b><span>The context: Morija, Lesotho</span></b></p>
<p><span>The small town
of Morija is one of the leading educational centres in Lesotho, Southern
Africa. Nearly 2,000 children attend its two primary schools and two high
schools. 25 other primary and high schools are located within a 10 kilometre
radius of the town. However, the young people living in this town (both
in-school and out-of-school) face numerous challenges: </span></p>
<p>·<span>  </span><span>Until recently, the town has had no public internet access, library or
community centre</span>. This
means that young people have had no access to valuable online resources.</p>
<p><span>·<span>  </span></span><span>There are very few places in Morija that offer a positive social and
learning environment.</span></p>
<p><span>·<span>  </span></span><span>The majority of young people in the town come from very poor families,
and are desperately looking for employment. However, in a country where an
estimated 30-40% of young people are unemployed, job prospects are slim and
most young people struggle to find work. </span></p>
<p>·<span>  </span>The opportunity to receive training and
practice on digital media equipment is only available to university students,
or through private colleges in Maseru. Until recently, these facilities have
been beyond the reach of <span>most young people in Morija.</span></p>
<p><b>The Hub: a new creative technology lab</b></p>
<p>The Hub, a new creative technology lab in Morija, seeks to directly tackle these challenges. O<span>fficially
launched in August 2015, The Hub </span>provides
affordable access to computers and the internet to people living in Morija.
Thanks to generous sponsorship from two local donors - the Vodacom
Lesotho Foundation and Standard Lesotho Bank - the project is equipped with
seven laptops, six digital cameras, one HD-digital projector, a
printer/scanner/copier, a range of audio equipment and access to high-speed
internet. The primary target group of the project is young people between the
ages of 16-35, who can make use of The Hub’s online resources to help them with
schoolwork, revision and research projects. The Hub has already begun to offer
basic computer skills workshops, and in the near future will also offer digital
media training workshops on a range of subjects, including photography, film
making, creative writing and web design. The Hub operates on a membership basis
(annual membership to The Hub costs a minimal fee of M100, less than $8).
Members have full access to computers, the internet and all workshops. The
project is a purely not-for-profit enterprise, seeking to provide people in the
community with access to information and with a range of skills that are in
increasingly high demand by employers. </p>
<p><b>The Hub is
fundraising for a 10TB Wireless Network Storage Drive</b></p>
<p>The Hub urgently needs a Wireless Network Storage Drive for our work and
upcoming projects:</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>We currently do not have enough space on our computers for the large
project files that will accumulate from digital media training workshops and
from the creative work that our members will soon start to produce. </p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>We only have seven laptops, and 40 members (a number that is growing
fast). Our members move around from laptop to laptop depending on the availability
of workspaces, and therefore do not have continuous access to the same laptop. </p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>We have already begun to store on each individual computer a range of
educational videos and material. However, storage space for such material on
each laptop is limited.</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>We need a central data storage device that can be easily accessed by all
our members. A 10 TB Wireless Network Storage Drive will provide us with
extensive and easily accessible data storage space for project work and
educational videos and material. All of The Hub’s computers will be connected
to the Drive: our members will be able to access the files and information on
the drive at any time. Members will also be able to save ongoing work onto the
Drive and access this work at a later stage from any one of our computers. </p>
<p>Specifically, we are fundraising for the following 10TB Wireless
Network Storage Drive,
available on Amazon: <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/WD-Cloud-EX2-Pre-configured-featuring/dp/B00I2P82CS"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span>http://www.amazon.com/WD-Cloud-EX2-Pre-configured-featuring/dp/B00I2P82CS</span></a></p>
<p>We would appreciate any donation, great or small, to contribute to our

most young people struggle to find work. 
·  The opportunity to receive training and
practice on digital media equipment is only available to university students,
or through private colleges in Maseru. Until recently, these facilities have
been beyond the reach of most young people in Morija.
The Hub: a new creative technology lab
The Hub, a new creative technology lab in Morija, seeks to directly tackle these challenges. Officially
launched in August 2015, The Hub provides
affordable access to computers and the internet to people living in Morija.
Thanks to generous sponsorship from two local donors - the Vodacom
Lesotho Foundation and Standard Lesotho Bank - the project is equipped with
seven laptops, six digital cameras, one HD-digital projector, a
printer/scanner/copier, a range of audio equipment and access to high-speed
internet. The primary target group of the project is young people between the
ages of 16-35, who can make use of The Hub’s online resources to help them with
schoolwork, revision and research projects. The Hub has already begun to offer
basic computer skills workshops, and in the near future will also offer digital
media training workshops on a range of subjects, including photography, film
making, creative writing and web design. The Hub operates on a membership basis
(annual membership to The Hub costs a minimal fee of M100, less than $8).
Members have full access to computers, the internet and all workshops. The
project is a purely not-for-profit enterprise, seeking to provide people in the
community with access to information and with a range of skills that are in
increasingly high demand by employers. 
The Hub is
fundraising for a 10TB Wireless Network Storage Drive
The Hub urgently needs a Wireless Network Storage Drive for our work and
upcoming projects:
· 
We currently do not have enough space on our computers for the large
project files that will accumulate from digital media training workshops and
from the creative work that our members will soon start to produce. 
· 
We only have seven laptops, and 40 members (a number that is growing
fast). Our members move around from laptop to laptop depending on the availability
of workspaces, and therefore do not have continuous access to the same laptop. 
· 
We have already begun to store on each individual computer a range of
educational videos and material. However, storage space for such material on
each laptop is limited.
· 
We need a central data storage device that can be easily accessed by all
our members. A 10 TB Wireless Network Storage Drive will provide us with
extensive and easily accessible data storage space for project work and
educational videos and material. All of The Hub’s computers will be connected
to the Drive: our members will be able to access the files and information on
the drive at any time. Members will also be able to save ongoing work onto the
Drive and access this work at a later stage from any one of our computers. 
Specifically, we are fundraising for the following 10TB Wireless
Network Storage Drive,
available on Amazon: http://www.amazon.com/WD-Cloud-EX2-Pre-configured-featuring/dp/B00I2P82CS
We would appreciate any donation, great or small, to contribute to our
fundraising goal of $574.
If you would like further information about The Hub, or would like to
support the project in other ways, please visit our website, our Facebook

<h3><strong>INTRODUCING THE HD-360 PLATINUM GOLD HDMI CABLE… THE ANSWER TO GAMER’S PRAY.</strong></h3>
</center>
<p>Here we are, discovered a cable that can maximize your gaming experience. It is specifically designed for gaming console. It optimizes graphic quality in gaming, deliver faster speed and much more...</p>
<p>Our team designed our cable to be at par with features and quality to any of the famous branded (and quite expensive) premium cables (such as monxxxter cable, audixxxuest, etc), but with MORE… features specially for gaming. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><img alt=""Xbox 360 HDMI - Wii HDMI - Playstation 3 HDMI Platinum Gold Pro Gaming Cable"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/286540/pictures/full/20120623020747-Productpic.jpg?1340442489"" src="""" style="""" title=""Xbox 360 HDMI - Wii HDMI - Playstation 3 HDMI Platinum Gold Pro Gaming Cable""/></p>
<p>As a bonus, and because we want our technology to reach everybody and not only the elite… with a better cable than anybody else can offer, we are planning to offer ours at a retail price that is only half the value of premium cables in the market.  Why do this?  Why the low price?  Because we think that every gamer deserves to experience their “perfect game”. After all, this is the main reason we develop the cable, we want to have something especially for gaming but with affordable price.</p>
<p>We also believe that the product will also perform excellently on the rumored Xbox 720 with code name “Durango” (<a href=""http://www.ign.com/wikis/xbox-720"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.ign.com/wikis/xbox-720</a>).  There are not much leaked info on this project to faithfully test our product on it, but based on our development team, the cable will still perform at its best and will still be the best cable even for the upcoming Xbox 720.  We always develop for the future to assure our users that our technology will always be on top and will never be obsolete.</p>
<p><strong>Moreover, </strong>in trying to develop the best cable, the product will also work best on the latest blu-ray or DVD players or other HD video players in the market.  The product is also HDMI version 1.4, which will play all 3D formats.</p>

<p>Simply change your boring old cables to our state of the art gaming HDMI cable and experience all of these in an instant. Imagine yourself experiencing the war environment of Call of Duty: Black Ops 2, or being mesmerized by the view while standing on top of a tower in Assassin’s Creed 3.  Feel like you are really playing the game in NBA 2K12 and FIFA 13… drive like you have no tomorrow in Forza Motorsports 4.</p>
<p>Based on the trials and interviews, 100% agreed that our product is better than all the commercially available cables that we tested against.  We were better in price and quality, and unanimously agreed that they would rather buy our product than the competitor’s.  In retrospect, all that the development team has done is for the benefit of every gamer out there. We can finally offer a product that is better but cost lower.</p>
<h2><strong>Top 10 Reasons why our cable is different:</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Reason 1: Feel more confidence</strong> while playing because you are using a cable that specifically designed for gaming console and developed for the gaming console like Xbox, PS3, Wii, etc.  Why use generic cables when you have one designed to enhance your gaming console.</li>
<li>
<strong>Reason 2: Enjoy Real HD experience</strong> as the cable is optimized for game playing, perfect for games with intricate details. </li>
<li>
<strong>Reason 3:</strong> <strong>Say goodbye to delayed/lagging issue</strong>. We deliver faster speed than any commercially available cables</li>
<li>
<strong>Reason 4: Fully Optimized for 3D gaming graphic</strong> (like Racing game, First-person shooter, or RPG game)</li>
<li>
<strong>Reason 5: Experience the real 3D</strong> (if games support it) when played on a real 3D TV.</li>
<li>
<strong>Reason 6: Enjoy Hassle Free installation and maximum quality graphic</strong> with Innovative Flat HD jacket technology. Studies have proven that a flat design is much better than a round cable.  The cables are harder to break because of the even pressure of the cable, designed to handle bending and other related stress.  A flat design is also much better aesthetically because the cables can be hidden a lot better (under carpets, behind TV’s, inside tables etc.).</li>
<li>
<strong>Reason 7: You can Feel Safer</strong> with our “Cotton sleeve” material cable ensuring high insulating control to avoid heat and short-circuit danger risk.</li>
<li>
<strong>Reason 8: Enjoy maximum performance</strong> from new generation 1080p HDTVs, DVD players, and HD cable/satellite receivers</li>
<li>
<strong>Reason 9: </strong>The cable is designed with the <strong>same feature and quality</strong> with the most expensive cables out there.</li>
<li>
<strong>Reason 10:</strong> All of these is planned to be sold for <strong>half the price of our competitors</strong>

<h2>Campaign purpose</h2>
<p>The purpose of these campaigns is two-fold: 
Firstly to raise funds for the development and production of the product, but more importantly to create awareness of the product, to get a support base of thousands of supporters and users so that we can apply pressure on manufacturers of electronics equipment to become compliant with our technologies. We also want to find potential technology partners, and that is already starting to work. The funding will be used to take the product to the Beta stage.</p>
<h2>Ever wish you had one remote for everything?</h2>
<p>TV, sound system, DVD player, satellite … way too much coffee table clutter, right? Don’t you wish you had one remote that could control it all?  </p>
<p>Well, yes, there is the universal remote. Complicated. Millions of buttons. None of which dim your lights or start the aircon. Or open your gate, garage door or unlock your car.</p>
<p>All that is about to change with Oneremote. It’s sheer genius. A compact device with three simple actions. Point. Swipe. Click.</p>
<p>Really.</p>
<p></p>
<p>It is small and sexy. Fits in your hand like it was designed to be there. Come to think of it, it was! Slip it into your pants pocket, and it curves around your thigh like a second skin. Slick. But hang on, why would you want to carry a TV remote around with you? 
Good question. Read on.</p>
<h2>Personal power</h2>
<p>Oneremote is a personal remote. Each has a built-in, unique identity that can never be changed. That identity is transmitted securely whenever you interact with a device. Because you care who can open your 
garage door, garden gate or unlock your car, house or office.</p>
<p>Oneremote gets registered to you on a central database. If you lose it, or it gets stolen, it can be identified whenever it is found. If someone uses it on a web-connected device, you can find them. If you sell it, you have to transfer 
ownership, just like a car or a firearm.</p><h2>Is it really so easy to use?</h2><p>Anyone that can use a computer mouse, can use 1REMOTE. Set it up by choosing your components from a list, and tell the system where they are located by pointing at them, and you're done. Define your hotspots for volume, channels or other frequently used commands and you're done. Now browse your device's menus and commands on screen, like using a mouse on your computer. For devices like music players we will be designing simple add-on command screens, that can either project simple menus on a wall or on a small screen.</p>
<h2>I love it! I want it! I want to help make it happen!</h2>

<h1>FAQ</h1>
<h2>You ran another Indiegogo campaign previously. What's up with that?</h2><p>In October we ran a trial Indiegogo campaign to learn about how crowd funding works and see if there was interest in our product. You can find that campaign <a href=""http://igg.me/at/oneremote/x/4801695"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here</a>. There was, and now we are running a proper campaign to raise money to fund the next stage of development and take the product to Beta testing. We are planning a third campaign towards the middle of next year to fund the first production run, should we need to.<br/></p><h2>You ran a previous campaign with different perks. Will we still be getting our perks from that campaign?</h2><p>Of course, we will honour any commitments made during that campaign.</p><h2>How is Oneremote different from other universal remotes?</h2><p>It is different because of the ability to point precisely, whether it's at a menu on a screen, or a light switch or garage door. You click, double click or swipe to give your instruction. Think of it as having a mouse that you can use virtually anywhere. It's so intuitive you hardly need to think about what you're doing.</p><h2>How does it work?</h2><p>1REMOTE is a new kind of remote that works like a mouse. Think of it as a mouse that is also a laser pointer. You hold it in your hand and point at things around you. With your thumb you can click, double click and right click on the two buttons. You can also swipe to scroll. The green laser dot shows you where you are pointing, just like a laser pointer.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><h2>I have a learning remote. I can program it by pointing my old remote at it and mapping the signal it sends to the keys on the new one.<br/>
</h2>
Yes, we will be doing that, but only as a last resort. By the time we go to market, most popular remotes should already be in our database, due to the Beta programme. If somebody else has already done the work, you don't have to redo it.<p><br/></p><p></p><h3>A remote cannot communicate with a garage door and car lock on its own. How will you address that?</h3><p>That is correct, it would require either a compatible garage door opener or car door lock - or it would require an additional (quite simple in the case of the garage door) piece of hardware to emulate the existing remote control. Car doors will probably have to wait until car manufacturers implement our technology, which is on the road map.</p><h2><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Devices like TVs and Blu-ray players are unable to be controlled by a swipe type gesture control. How can you support that?</span></h2><p>Yes, gestures are interpreted by the commander and translated into the appropriate commands for the device by the commander unit. It is however our plan to get manufacturers to implement our technology, so that TVs come with the gesturing capability built in.</p><br/><p></p><p></p>
<h2>What is the 'eye'?</h2>
<p>The eye is what makes 1REMOTE smart. Like a mouse, not just a laser pointer. Whenever the remote points anywhere near the eye, the eye is able to detect where it is pointing. Let’s call this the zone.</p>
<h2>What is the 'zone'?</h2>
<p>The zone is a circular area around the eye where the eye can detect very accurately where the remote is pointing. It can also detect any actions being performed on the remote. That’s cool, but so what?</p>
<p>Plug it into a USB on your laptop or connect via Bluetooth and it becomes a very cool presentation tool - a laser pointer that’s also a mouse. That’s right, click on a menu item, and something happens!</p>
<h2>Can the remote and the eye control my entertainment system by themselves?</h2>
<p>No, unless you have a compliant AV receiver. It is not impossible that your receiver could be compliant by the time we release, as we will be working with manufacturers over the next year to achieve exactly this objective. It could be that you would only need to 
upgrade the firmware on your receiver, and you are in business. Otherwise, you will need the 'commander'.</p>
<h2>What is the 'commander'?</h2>
<p>The commander is the brain of the outfit as far as controlling complicated AV equipment goes. It communicates with your components using infrared, Ethernet, Z-wave, USB or Wi-Fi, whichever your device supports. It is easy to set up and we will have a 
preloaded database of thousands of devices by the time we go to market, thanks to our army of BETA testers.</p>
<h2>I don't have an AV receiver, what now?</h2>
<p>You will need one of our HDMI switches. Available in 4 and 8 ports, these switches complete the line-up required to control virtually any reasonable AV setup.</p>
<h2>How will you make sure it works with everything?</h2>
<p>Through our funding campaigns we are inviting contributors to participate in our Beta programme. A thousand enthusiastic contributors will be testing and working with us to ensure that we can handle the vast majority of electronics out there. We will have a shared database where users can add their stuff. If somebody has added it, you don't have to redo the work. We will be working with manufacturers to ensure new stuff comes ready-made for our remote, and those things which can get software updates can even be retrofitted with our technology.</p><h2>So I have to get another 2-3 devices to control my other 3 devices?</h2><p>Hopefully only one or two, if you have a compliant receiver or TV. Which may be only a firmware upgrade away by the time we release. In that case you only need the remote and the eye, which is tiny and unobtrusive.</p>
<h2>You guys are based in Africa. Can you really do something this big?</h2>
<p>South African inventions have famously simplified life around the globe. The first automated pool cleaner was invented by South Africans. So was the Steadicam. South African entrepreneurs have had a huge impact on the world. Elon Musk, 
founder of SpaceX and co-founder of PayPal and Tesla motors, was born and schooled here. The first heart transplant was done in South Africa. There are world leaders in mining, industry and yes, even electronics based right here. We're talking to some of them 
already.</p>
<p>The short answer is, yes.</p>

<p>The mobile phone has become an essential utility and for many of us, one of our highest monthly expenses. Yet virtually none of us are happy with our service and feel the pain each month. </p>
<p>If you could keep your plans, upgrade your
service experience and enjoy a sense of doing good with each bill you pay, why wouldn’t you? That’s the key to VoiceWorks and helping nonprofits. VoiceWorks offers state-of-the-art phone service at the same cost your supporters are paying now. </p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/300637/files/20140110052750-VWM_crowdfunding_statistic.jpg?1389360470"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p><br/></p><p></p>
<p>With VoiceWorks, you donate 10% of every monthly bill to the charity of your choice with no extra cost to you!
VoiceWorks helps our customers feel good with each bill they pay. And our charitable partners enjoy a sustained donation stream. Imagine a bill that thanks you for your contribution to
changing a life.  That’s the VoiceWorks
difference. </p>
<p>For customers, helping worthy nonprofit organizations has never been easier, or as easy on their bottom line. With VoiceWorks, they’ll be able to give more by simply using a mobile phone.</p>
<p>Our subscribers enjoy the exact same plans and rates as their traditional providers, but with VoiceWorks, they’re making a positive contribution to the nonprofit they believe in.</p>
<p>Our goal is to create a win-win for nonprofits and customers who support them, while providing them the tools and the funding so they all can make a difference every day.</p><p><br/></p><p><b>A special thanks to our first partner:</b></p><h1><span style=""font-size: 24px; letter-spacing: 0em; line-height: 26px;""><p></p>

<p><br/></p></span></h1><h3><span style=""font-size: 24px; letter-spacing: 0em; line-height: 26px;"">How does VoiceWorks Mobile make it so easy to donate?</span></h3>
<p>VoiceWorks operates as a Mobile Virtual Network Operator, or an MVNO, which provides mobile phone services by leasing air time at wholesale prices from major carriers. As an MVNO, VoiceWorks Mobile (VWM) does need to invest in its own infrastructure to provide mobile phone services. As a MVNO, VWM delivers all the activities just as traditional mobile service provider, without the cost of owning the radio network and associated infrastructure.</p>
<p>Without these enormous maintenance, research and development costs, VWM can streamline operational costs and reallocate profits into donations.</p>
<p>Additionally, traditional mobile network operators (MNOs) allocate large portions of their operational expenses for massive, nation-wide advertising campaigns required to attract new subscribers. Instead, VWM creates close partnerships with non-profit organizations and leverages their customer base to increase subscriptions. The non-profit organization (NPO) is highly motivated to add value and provide their users with an essential services that provides a reliable monthly revenue stream. Likewise, members of the non-profits have a huge incentive to support their NPO simply by switching an essential utility -- their mobile phone service -- and making a monthly contribution without impacting their existing budget. Plus, at the end of the year, subscribers use the 10% contribution as a deduction on their income taxes.</p>
<p>Most importantly, VoiceWorks adheres to a fundamental corporate philosophy: turn profits into charitable contributions that do good for many instead of enriching a few individuals.</p>
<p>That's the radical new way of doing business that makes VoiceWorks so unique: it's not about making a profit, it's about making a difference and helping NPOs one monthly bill at a time.  </p><p><br/></p><h3><b>What We Need &amp; What You Get</b></h3><p></p><p>Our founder &amp; CEO, Reid Moody, developed a working prototype, created the business model, and established the initial relationships with MNO carriers to provide the services. But now we need help to turn the idea into a fully functional MVNO.

Austin startup's goal: To be a national phone company, prolific donor > 

The Power of VoiceWorks
The mobile phone has become an essential utility and for many of us, one of our highest monthly expenses. Yet virtually none of us are happy with our service and feel the pain each month. 
If you could keep your plans, upgrade your
service experience and enjoy a sense of doing good with each bill you pay, why wouldn’t you? That’s the key to VoiceWorks and helping nonprofits. VoiceWorks offers state-of-the-art phone service at the same cost your supporters are paying now. 
With VoiceWorks, you donate 10% of every monthly bill to the charity of your choice with no extra cost to you!
VoiceWorks helps our customers feel good with each bill they pay. And our charitable partners enjoy a sustained donation stream. Imagine a bill that thanks you for your contribution to
changing a life.  That’s the VoiceWorks
difference. 
For customers, helping worthy nonprofit organizations has never been easier, or as easy on their bottom line. With VoiceWorks, they’ll be able to give more by simply using a mobile phone.
Our subscribers enjoy the exact same plans and rates as their traditional providers, but with VoiceWorks, they’re making a positive contribution to the nonprofit they believe in.
Our goal is to create a win-win for nonprofits and customers who support them, while providing them the tools and the funding so they all can make a difference every day.A special thanks to our first partner:

How does VoiceWorks Mobile make it so easy to donate?
VoiceWorks operates as a Mobile Virtual Network Operator, or an MVNO, which provides mobile phone services by leasing air time at wholesale prices from major carriers. As an MVNO, VoiceWorks Mobile (VWM) does need to invest in its own infrastructure to provide mobile phone services. As a MVNO, VWM delivers all the activities just as traditional mobile service provider, without the cost of owning the radio network and associated infrastructure.
Without these enormous maintenance, research and development costs, VWM can streamline operational costs and reallocate profits into donations.
Additionally, traditional mobile network operators (MNOs) allocate large portions of their operational expenses for massive, nation-wide advertising campaigns required to attract new subscribers. Instead, VWM creates close partnerships with non-profit organizations and leverages their customer base to increase subscriptions. The non-profit organization (NPO) is highly motivated to add value and provide their users with an essential services that provides a reliable monthly revenue stream. Likewise, members of the non-profits have a huge incentive to support their NPO simply by switching an essential utility -- their mobile phone service -- and making a monthly contribution without impacting their existing budget. Plus, at the end of the year, subscribers use the 10% contribution as a deduction on their income taxes.
Most importantly, VoiceWorks adheres to a fundamental corporate philosophy: turn profits into charitable contributions that do good for many instead of enriching a few individuals.
That's the radical new way of doing business that makes VoiceWorks so unique: it's not about making a profit, it's about making a difference and helping NPOs one monthly bill at a time.  What We Need & What You GetOur founder & CEO, Reid Moody, developed a working prototype, created the business model, and established the initial relationships with MNO carriers to provide the services.

<p>It all started with a simple idea: to design and produce a useful and innovative product, that will solve problems of the iPhone user. SIMpro ended up being our first and most valuable idea, as we saw many use cases in today’s society.  </p>
<p>The biggest challenge was to design a small and convenient product, which would keep a high performance and capacity standard. On the other hand we needed to design the app and its UI with the “user-first” focus, to make it very simple and user friendly. Additionally we wanted to make a product that business and personal users would be happy to own and carry around.  </p>
<p>We spent a lot of time researching existing products in the market, testing and designing the SIMpro. We compared SIMpro with other independent products, from battery to outer shell materials, from SIM card slot to Apps UI. We have truly tried our very best to improve and upgrade what is already on the market.  </p>
<p>And finally here it is. A masterpiece that is powerful, efficient, convenient and suitable for business or personal use.</p>

It all started with a simple idea: to design and produce a useful and innovative product, that will solve problems of the iPhone user. SIMpro ended up being our first and most valuable idea, as we saw many use cases in today’s society.  
The biggest challenge was to design a small and convenient product, which would keep a high performance and capacity standard. On the other hand we needed to design the app and its UI with the “user-first” focus, to make it very simple and user friendly. Additionally we wanted to make a product that business and personal users would be happy to own and carry around.  
We spent a lot of time researching existing products in the market, testing and designing the SIMpro. We compared SIMpro with other independent products, from battery to outer shell materials, from SIM card slot to Apps UI. We have truly tried our very best to improve and upgrade what is already on the market.  
And finally here it is. A masterpiece that is powerful, efficient, convenient and suitable for business or personal use.




Our team is not big, but it is complete. It comprises of designers, software developers, researchers, hardware engineers, and other staff with their professional skills in different areas.

So, they created Fishball.Fishball is the only device of its kind that lets you capture in full 360 degrees, using your phone's powerful rear camera. It's ultra-portable and super simple to use. If you can record with a phone, you can record with Fishball.Best of all, it uses special optics, not electronics, so there's nothing to charge, no memory cards to buy, and no wireless pairing required. Just clip it on and shoot. Fishball's proprietary lens system utilizes your iPhone's existing camera to capture every angle and every detail of your moments. And since everything is captured directly on your phone and not on a separate memory card, you can instantly share to platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Vimeo—basically any platform that hosts 360° images and videos.  

 
FeaturesAs a bonus, Fishball is future-proof and works across multiple phone models. So the next time you upgrade your iPhone and its camera, Fishball upgrades along with you!Fishball is compatible with iPhone 7, 7 Plus, 8, 8 Plus, and the brand-new iPhone X.(Android users: please help us make this campaign a success, so we can use your input on what models to support next here - http://bit.ly/FishballAndroidSurvey)Stretch goalFishball is perfect for travel, nature, city viewing, concerts, and any other moment you'd love to re-experience or share. 360° content makes you feel as if you're truly experiencing it, even if you couldn't be there the first time.The ability to share moments with loved ones also makes Fishball a perfect gift. Do you live apart from loved ones, but want to still feel like you're right there? Send them a Fishball!Got any adventures coming up? Fishball will ship by this coming summer to make sure that you capture every moment with the full detail it deserves.

ReverseMAX uses the latest chipset from Mediatek and we have the pleasure to partnered with one of the world's leading Wireless Broadband solutions provider with 25+ years of experience(Trust me, they are very very good).  

Please be aware that ReverseMAX is not a product yet, as it is not available anywhere in the market yet. However, we do have a working prototype with BOM(Bill of Material) ready. After talking to our manufacturer they have agreed to manufacturer ReverseMAX with a MOQ(Minimum Order Quantity) of 3000 units.  This is where you come in and make this all into a reality. We are super excited and we can't wait to ship out ReverseMAX onto your hands.",7.0,0,"4 Campaigns

<h2>What’s so special?</h2>
<p>Dotlens:</p>
<ul>
<li>Works by attaching the lens directly onto your smartphone, no large barrels, no big attachments, just one single elegantly designed lens.</li>
<li>Has an identical optical power as professional microscope lenses that cost ten to a hundred times more.</li>
<li>Is easy to remove without residue.</li>
<li>Contains a special hydrophobic and scratch resistant outer coating for easy cleaning.</li>
<li>Is compatible with almost all smartphones and tablets.</li>
<p>Use, and re-use, and re-use … there’s no limit to the number of times you can use the lens, and the adhesive does not weaken with time!</p>
</ul><div></div>

<h2>Funding Goal</h2>
<p>We want to fire your passion for discovering the microscopic world around you, and to excite more people about it! But we are limited by the number of lenses we can make each day. Each dotlens is created by hand in our garage, and checked for defects by eye. </p>
<p>Your contribution will enable us to purchase automatic fabrication and verification equipment from the top optical instrument providers in the US.</p>

<h2>Risks and Challenges</h2>
<p>Both the 15x and 120x lenses are now in the production stage. Each lens is created in-house and visually inspected for perfection. This manual process is time consuming but we are still on track to ship all rewards before the year ends.</p>

The inventor, a 25-year-old from Huntington Beach CA, wanted to make a rad, multi-purpose product so we would have less junk and a little less trash in the ocean.</p><h1><i>Tenikle is every mount/stand/tripod or selfie device you could possibly need in one and its made of 100% recyclable thermoplastic. </i></h1><p>We know you're tired of boring products, so we made Tenikle fun. It's a toy with a purpose.  </p><p>We work with the best plastics manufacturer in the country to produce our product and we are proud to say Tenikle is made in the USA right in San Diego, California.  </p><p>Tenikle is driven by ultimate creativity. We push to be different in every way possible. Join us on a fun and crazy ride as we invent to make this planet a little more rad.</p><p>:)</p><h1>Creator's Story</h1><p><i>Hi! </i></p><p><i>I'm Hans, the creator of Tenikle. I surf and love to make things.</i></p><p><i>My professional background is in apparel and graphic design, where I have been employed in the surf industry for brands like Hurley and Billabong since 2009.</i></p><p><i>However, I've always had a passion for engineering and industrial design. </i></p><p><i>In 2013, I had an idea for a phone case mechanism that could attach all sorts of accessories, like battery power, lenses, clips, mounts, wallets etc. I called it Tenikle because of my love for the ocean. While trying to brand my case concept, I decided I wanted to make a product that resembled a tentacle.</i></p><p><i>Then one day I get pulled over by a cop for looking at my phone. He let me go without a ticket and told me to get a mount so I don't get pulled over again. In fear of getting a future ticket, I went to a major tech store to buy a car mount. As I was searching to pick out the perfect one, I became disappointed that they were all the same big, boring, black mount and only did one thing! That's when the idea hit me.</i></p><p><i>I set out to create a fun car mount that could be used in more ways than just as a car mount.</i></p><div data-id=""17990010""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://indiegogo-media-prod-cld-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1505934498/muubjrxwxvx17kscdaxd.jpg"" src=""""/></figure></div><p><i>Being a lover of all things creative, I decided to do everything on my own. I learned 3D CAD software, designed the product, wrote a patent, 3D printed molds, tested different materials, learned mold-making, created almost 100 different prototypes in my tiny garage, built a website, found a US manufacturer, got a business loan to purchase the molds, and filmed/edited the videos with my best friend from high school, Erik (@cloudroamer).</i></p><p><i>During this whole process, I wrote a guide called the DIY Inventor Kit, so that others can create their inventions on their own as well. It's full of fun design and a thorough 9 steps to help you get to the place I am now. If you don't have an invention yet, it shows you how to come up with one by using my process. You'll get a digital copy if you help out and pledge $10 :)</i></p><p><i>This project was quite a bit of work but well worth it because this thing is awesome! I really hope you love and use it too :)</i></p><p><i>Thank you for your support!</i></p><p><i>-Hans</i></p><p>                 @hansdose                                    @everybody.loves.lydia</p><div data-id=""17980315""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://indiegogo-media-prod-cld-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1505934498/t3lcnayih7jdr6hqmep3.png"" src=""""/></figure></div><p> </p><p> </p></div>","​

In a modest one-car garage full of surfboards and art, just steps from the sand in Huntington Beach, California Tenikle was born. The inventor, a 25-year-old from Huntington Beach CA, wanted to make a rad, multi-purpose product so we would have less junk and a little less trash in the ocean.Tenikle is every mount/stand/tripod or selfie device you could possibly need in one and its made of 100% recyclable thermoplastic. We know you're tired of boring products, so we made Tenikle fun. It's a toy with a purpose.  We work with the best plastics manufacturer in the country to produce our product and we are proud to say Tenikle is made in the USA right in San Diego, California.  Tenikle is driven by ultimate creativity. We push to be different in every way possible. Join us on a fun and crazy ride as we invent to make this planet a little more rad.:)Creator's StoryHi! I'm Hans, the creator of Tenikle. I surf and love to make things.My professional background is in apparel and graphic design, where I have been employed in the surf industry for brands like Hurley and Billabong since 2009.However, I've always had a passion for engineering and industrial design. In 2013, I had an idea for a phone case mechanism that could attach all sorts of accessories, like battery power, lenses, clips, mounts, wallets etc. I called it Tenikle because of my love for the ocean. While trying to brand my case concept, I decided I wanted to make a product that resembled a tentacle.Then one day I get pulled over by a cop for looking at my phone. He let me go without a ticket and told me to get a mount so I don't get pulled over again. In fear of getting a future ticket, I went to a major tech store to buy a car mount. As I was searching to pick out the perfect one, I became disappointed that they were all the same big, boring, black mount and only did one thing! That's when the idea hit me.I set out to create a fun car mount that could be used in more ways than just as a car mount.Being a lover of all things creative, I decided to do everything on my own. I learned 3D CAD software, designed the product, wrote a patent, 3D printed molds, tested different materials, learned mold-making, created almost 100 different prototypes in my tiny garage, built a website, found a US manufacturer, got a business loan to purchase the molds, and filmed/edited the videos with my best friend from high school, Erik (@cloudroamer).During this whole process, I wrote a guide called the DIY Inventor Kit, so that others can create their inventions on their own as well. It's full of fun design and a thorough 9 steps to help you get to the place I am now. If you don't have an invention yet, it shows you how to come up with one by using my process. You'll get a digital copy if you help out and pledge $10 :)This project was quite a bit of work but well worth it because this thing is awesome! I really hope you love and use it too :)Thank you for your support!-Hans                 @hansdose                                    @everybody.loves.lydia",32.0,0,"1 Campaign

0,"<div class=""routerContentStory-storyBody"" data-v-1df7bf5a=""""><h1>About the Project</h1><p>Cobblebot Inc. having already completed two
 successful Kickstarter and Indiegogo campaigns in the 3D printer arena has identified
 several areas in the consumer 3D printing world that could use 
improvement.  The area we are looking to address with this Indiegogo campaign deals with power supplies (PSUs).</p><p>We are in the final 
stages of development of the new Cobblebot PSU that is designed for use 
with 3D printers.  Those 3D printing enthusiast who have built their own
 3D printers (every member of the RepRap community) are undoubtedly 
familiar with the generic switching power supplies that can be found 
essentially everywhere.  The 3D printing community has been using these 
types of PSU's to power their 3D printers since the first consumer 3D 
printers started being built. <br/><br/>For the technically inclined who 
like to strip wires and connect them to terminals, these popular generic
 PSUs provide a reasonable power solution.  But they aren't a good 
solution and more importantly, they aren't a very safe solution 
(especially if you have kids around). <br/><br/>The Cobblebot PSU brings a
 higher level of user friendliness and safety to the 3d printing 
community and moves away from the the low quality generic terminal style
 PSUs.</p><h1> Quality and Cost</h1><p>Retail pricing on this unit will be $149.  </p><p>We
 tested out a variety of different quality parts for this PSU and can 
actually have a decent one made for approximately half the cost.  
However, we believe that when it comes dealing with power that cost 
should not be a factor when the trade-off would be not only quality but 
 safety.  We therefore have opted for the highest quality parts 
available from our manufacturer and these parts come at a premium cost.</p><h1>Certifications</h1><p>As our primary market is in the USA, all PSU's will comply with federal US certification requirements.<br/><br/>We
 may ship to countries which require CE certification but would require a
 minimum of 50 backers from these countries to back the project in order
 to pay for the CE certification.  </p><h1>
Development Run Down</h1><p>This PSU has been in development for some 
time now.  As you can see from the picture below, we started off our 
testing with non-modular units while we were testing the electronics 
themselves.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1454383546/lux7tyjoqneitxkahorl.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p>

</figure>
<p></p>
<p>As you can see the above non-modular unit has two standard 12V lines.  <br/><br/>The
 most current picture of the PSU, which is approximately 95% complete, 
has everything but the modular ports added.  This current prototype is 
the picture we use as the main campaign picture (and is below as well). <br/></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1454383603/jpwyar2xq6skownvobfd.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p>

<figcaption>Current state of the Cobblebot PSU, with red fan.  Still lacks modular ports.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p></p>
<p>Currently, the mould for the modular part of the PSU enclosure is 
currently being made and we except to have the final PSU enclosure in 
our hands the first week of March 2016.  A technical drawing of the 
modular ports being used in the creation of that mould is below. <br/></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1454383628/rpeb5o2clacdb0fhwwk6.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>This modular-port mould is one of the final two steps in completing 
the development of the PSU.  The other remaining step is customizing the
 modular 12V wires for use with various 3D printers.  For this part we 
would like the input of the community. <p>Obviously, one end of 
the modular wires will remain the 4-point connector in order to plug 
into the PSU.  Our thought was that the other end of one of the two wire
 sets would simply be wire ferrules - for easy insertion into some of 
the more commonly used 3d printer control boards, such as the Ramps 1.4 
board.  Our thought for the second wire set was a connector for use with
 a 12V hub that can used for fans/LEDs, etc..  <br/><br/>All suggestions 
from the community concerning the modular wire configuration will be 
greatly appreciated and will certainly be taken into consideration when 
making that final decision.</p><h1>Schedule</h1><p><b>February</b> - 
Throughout the period of the campaign we would like to work with our 
backers to determine the cabling configuration, as mentioned above. <br/><br/>The
 other electronic parts of the PSU have essentially been decided on and 
we expect no changes in those parts.  While it is possible that we may 
encounter an issue as we continue testing during the campaign period, it
 seems unlikely given the current stage of development that we are in 
and the amount of previous testing.  <br/><br/><b>March </b>- Once the 
mould is completed for the modular ports and we get the prototype in - 
as long there are no issues with the modular ports we will give our 
final approval. <br/><br/>Once we give final approval of the PSU, the PSU 
is submitted to a laboratory for testing and certification.   The 
certifications are expected to take 2-4 weeks, assuming no issues.  The

 successful Kickstarter and Indiegogo campaigns in the 3D printer arena has identified
 several areas in the consumer 3D printing world that could use 
improvement.  The area we are looking to address with this Indiegogo campaign deals with power supplies (PSUs).We are in the final 
stages of development of the new Cobblebot PSU that is designed for use 
with 3D printers.  Those 3D printing enthusiast who have built their own
 3D printers (every member of the RepRap community) are undoubtedly 
familiar with the generic switching power supplies that can be found 
essentially everywhere.  The 3D printing community has been using these 
types of PSU's to power their 3D printers since the first consumer 3D 
printers started being built. For the technically inclined who 
like to strip wires and connect them to terminals, these popular generic
 PSUs provide a reasonable power solution.  But they aren't a good 
solution and more importantly, they aren't a very safe solution 
(especially if you have kids around). The Cobblebot PSU brings a
 higher level of user friendliness and safety to the 3d printing 
community and moves away from the the low quality generic terminal style
 PSUs. Quality and CostRetail pricing on this unit will be $149.  We
 tested out a variety of different quality parts for this PSU and can 
actually have a decent one made for approximately half the cost.  
However, we believe that when it comes dealing with power that cost 
should not be a factor when the trade-off would be not only quality but 
 safety.  We therefore have opted for the highest quality parts 
available from our manufacturer and these parts come at a premium cost.CertificationsAs our primary market is in the USA, all PSU's will comply with federal US certification requirements.We
 may ship to countries which require CE certification but would require a
 minimum of 50 backers from these countries to back the project in order
 to pay for the CE certification.  
Development Run DownThis PSU has been in development for some 
time now.  As you can see from the picture below, we started off our 
testing with non-modular units while we were testing the electronics 
themselves.


One of the original test units, used for testing the PSU electronics.  Non-modular.


As you can see the above non-modular unit has two standard 12V lines.  The
 most current picture of the PSU, which is approximately 95% complete, 
has everything but the modular ports added.  This current prototype is 
the picture we use as the main campaign picture (and is below as well). 


Current state of the Cobblebot PSU, with red fan.  Still lacks modular ports.


Currently, the mould for the modular part of the PSU enclosure is 
currently being made and we except to have the final PSU enclosure in 
our hands the first week of March 2016.  A technical drawing of the 
modular ports being used in the creation of that mould is below. This modular-port mould is one of the final two steps in completing 
the development of the PSU.  The other remaining step is customizing the
 modular 12V wires for use with various 3D printers.  For this part we 
would like the input of the community. Obviously, one end of 
the modular wires will remain the 4-point connector in order to plug 
into the PSU.  Our thought was that the other end of one of the two wire
 sets would simply be wire ferrules - for easy insertion into some of 
the more commonly used 3d printer control boards, such as the Ramps 1.4 
board.  Our thought for the second wire set was a connector for use with
 a 12V hub that can used for fans/LEDs, etc..  All suggestions 
from the community concerning the modular wire configuration will be 
greatly appreciated and will certainly be taken into consideration when 
making that final decision.ScheduleFebruary - 
Throughout the period of the campaign we would like to work with our 
backers to determine the cabling configuration, as mentioned above. The
 other electronic parts of the PSU have essentially been decided on and 
we expect no changes in those parts.  While it is possible that we may 
encounter an issue as we continue testing during the campaign period, it
 seems unlikely given the current stage of development that we are in 
and the amount of previous testing.  March - Once the 
mould is completed for the modular ports and we get the prototype in - 
as long there are no issues with the modular ports we will give our 
final approval. Once we give final approval of the PSU, the PSU 
is submitted to a laboratory for testing and certification.   The 
certifications are expected to take 2-4 weeks, assuming no issues.  The 
biggest risk for delay lies with the certifications.  If the 
laboratory finds an issue that needs to be addressed, the PSU will have 
to modified and resubmitted.  Given the experience of the engineers 
involved in the development of this PSU, we do not foresee any issues 
with obtaining the certifications on the first run.April -

Hi! My name is Shanna, and I need your help to achieve my goal of being able to stream games and create works of digital art. My computer is ancient, and it's beginning to die. I live on a very limited income, so I can never afford to upgrade.
 
To give you a bit more insight, I will get super personal. I'm a hermit, and I'm also sick. The money I get is from disability. At this point, I've outlived the time frame the doctors gave me so I'm unsure when I'm going to drop dead, but I don't plan on it anytime soon. I'm pretty determined to stay alive for my cats. And video games. These are the things that make me happy.
 
Yes, I'm a crazy cat lady. No, I don't own a million cats.
 

What I Need & What You Get
$700 would be amazing. It would pretty much cover the cost of the entire build I have in mind. Any extra will go to bills and my cats.

<div>
<p>We have tested our designs and worked through all the edge cases but making a physical thing is always a little challenging.</p>
<p>The preparation for delivery of each pledge level has been addressed before starting this campaign and we are confident that the timelines outlined are accurate, having allowed for variation in supply time for all components of the project.</p>
<p>We have created a live video stream of actual working hardware as it would be shipped to you. The design is fully functional and we encourage you to view the real-time version so that you may be confident we can delivery Crowd Counter Kits and IoT Counter modules within a reasonable time-frame.</p>
<p>Stretch goals are the wildcard here as all other elements have been developed up to pre-production state ahead of us seeking crowd-funding. </p>
<p>If we are successfully funded up to a stretch goal we will have much needed time and resources to commit to the software development, accelerating us towards making these goals a reality.</p>

</div></div>","IoT Counters Explained
The Internet of Things (IoT) is a term which describes the abundance of web connected devices which we will see flood the world over the next decade. Whether it be a drone, or a phone, or some random possession in your home, all of these things could be internet connected soon.Many of these IoT devices are designed to collect, store, and communicate information or data both within your home, at your work, and up into the clouds. These data pools are sometimes analysed and crunched to make sense of it all and then displayed somehow.To help alleviate the complexities of presenting human readable and focused details from the web we have created a new type of display using a very familiar technology, the IoT Counter.
The IoT Counters come in two flavors:

IoT Counter 16 - An alpha-numeric display module, good for letters and numbers. This display is made up of eight 16 segment LED modules, each about 1"" or 25mm in height, and offered in a selection of colours (red, green, orange). 

IoT Counter 7 - A Numeric display module, good for numbers and a simplified set of letters. This display consists of eight 7 segment LED modules, each about 1"" or 25mm height, and offered in a selection of single colours (red, blue ,green, yellow, orange). 
The IoT Counter is a USB connected device and appears as a standard communications port to a host PC or embedded platform such as an Intel Edison. The USB connection provides instant power and data for ease of use with a wide variety of platforms. Furthermore, an Arduino compatible device can be connected directly to each board using a serial output in combination with an external 5V power source for independent cascade connected configuration, allowing you to run as many displays in a line as you can safely power.To showcase the utility of the IoT Counter we have made a variety of display technologies include the Crowd Counter Kit (shown in the videos above and below), a free standing Desktop Display Kit, and a display we like to call the Back-to-The-Present Counter.
The Edi-ExpandTo help bring USB connected technologies such at the IoT Counter together in the IoT world we have created a motherboard for the Intel Edison, called an Edi-Expand, which is utilised within both the Crowd Counter and Back-to-the-Present Display Kits as the brains of the operation.Each Edi-Expand has the following main features:
4 USB ports,  
Dedicated console connection,  
MicroSD card slot,  
Ethernet, and a  
Voltage selectable Raspberry-Pi compatible IO header


Connecting and powering 4 IoT Counters from the Intel Edison was a breeze with the Edi-Expand This helped us to easily extend the display capabilities of the Edison in a new and exciting ways.Using the Edi-Expand combined with Intel Edison IoT platform we were able to create a powerful, rapidly developed, software framework which supports data extraction, processing, storage/logging, and display, all in a compact design. This software drives the Crowd Counters shown in the live video feed.If you are excited about the Crowd Counter but don't know how to configure one that is OK. We have made a simple Python tool which runs on both PC and Mac platforms, helps generate all the necessary configuration information, and packages it up into a file which runs on the Intel Edison utilised within each Crowd Counter. This allows you to setup a Crowd Counter with little or no coding experience.
The IoT Counter Software APIThe IoT Counter technology is used in conjunction with software libraries developed by us in two languages,
Python
Arduino C/C++
This allows the IoT Counter to be easily integrated into many hardware platforms such as the Intel Edison, Raspberry-Pi, PC, Mac, Linux, and wide range of Arduino compatible devices.Many different display modes are supported including:
Text - Scrolling, flipped, animated
Numbers - Integer and floating point
Temperatures - Degrees C and Fahrenheit
Currency
Raw segment control - Useful for custom symbols and animations
You can also control other parameters such as:
Scroll rate,
Display brightness, and
Screen orientation
We have carefully crafted an easy-to-use, open source software development framework so that you can get up and running with these displays very quickly in your own IoT projects!
 If we are successfully funded, all of the Python and Arduino code, electronics hardware, firmware, and CAD files for each kit will be uploaded to GitHub and Sketchfab so that you can build your own variants or extend the functionality as you wish.Further supporting documentation will be created to help with assembly, programming, and testing of each kit.Call To ActionAt a basic level you can help us to make the hardware and software release possible.With your contributions you can also assist us in making these devices and tools better, easier to use, cheaper, and more readily available.We seek to support a community of makers, software developers, electronics engineers, tinkerers, entrepreneurs, and hardware hackers.Any further funds raised go towards making better documentation and improved outreach programs, both local to Australia, and throughout the world.We genuinely hope to create a more vibrant community of innovators here in Melbourne through the continued display of ingenuity in technology but see the Internet of People (IoP) unbounded by traditional borderlines of this country or that.If the video made you laugh and you read this far without an overwhelming impulse to go IoT Counter crazy, think of supporting us with a dollar.Your contribution truly counts.

Power supply is not included but we will list suppliers, part number, and type for each country we ship. You also get a limited edition T-Shirt!!


Stretch GoalsIf we receive further support from backers beyond our initial goal we will continue to offer increasing levels of open source software components which enhance the utility of the IoT Counts, Display Kits, and Edi-Expand. 
 These software widgets and base-code extensions will enable new levels of functionality out of the box, making it easier for backers to get up and running with new display applications.
The TeamWe are a dedicated team of young engineers who love a good challenge and the opportunity to make new technology which solves the problems of today and hopefully tomorrow as well.

TimelineBelow is our timeline. We believe we have the hardware sorted and look forward to getting kits and rewards to each backer within two months of the campaign ending.

The T-ShirtWe designed a t-shirt. It glows in the dark just like our counters. If you back the Crowd counter or Back-to-the-Present display kit you will get one of these fine pieces of fabric. They will be a limited run. If you would just like the t-shirt we have offered that option too. Did I mention that it GLOWS IN THE DARK!!!
Risks and Challenges


We have tested our designs and worked through all the edge cases but making a physical thing is always a little challenging.
The preparation for delivery of each pledge level has been addressed before starting this campaign and we are confident that the timelines outlined are accurate, having allowed for variation in supply time for all components of the project.
We have created a live video stream of actual working hardware as it would be shipped to you. The design is fully functional and we encourage you to view the real-time version so that you may be confident we can delivery Crowd Counter Kits and IoT Counter modules within a reasonable time-frame.
Stretch goals are the wildcard here as all other elements have been developed up to pre-production state ahead of us seeking crowd-funding. 
If we are successfully funded up to a stretch goal we will have much needed time and resources to commit to the software development, accelerating us towards making these goals a reality.",19.0,2,"1 Campaign

numerical value, which indicates the intensity of the UV radiation affecting
human skin that reaches the surface of the earth. SPF and PA helps indicate and
estimate the time required to reach the maximum amount of UV to which you
should be exposed in any specific weather condition.</span><br/></p>

In addition, that will (of course) tell you nothing about the UVI in your position or other places you visit. For some, the UVindeSir and associated app will be the best thing since sliced bread (or the introduction of iPhone – your choice).</span></p>

can measure the UV radiation from the sun and temperature when and where you
like. The UV Index can vary widely depending on the following factors: time of
year or season, time of day, weather conditions, surfaces, altitude, and regions
of the world. Note that the real-time value measured probably differs from the regular renewed value from a forecasting service. This is caused by the
sun’s changing position, clouds, altitude, season, and other factors. UV Index
and temperature are changing all the time and you can use UVindeSir to track them.
It is helpful for you to make decision and limit your exposure to these harmful

Winter with UVindeSir





Love the sunshine with UVindeSir
Why UVindeSir?
UV Index is an international standardized
numerical value, which indicates the intensity of the UV radiation affecting
human skin that reaches the surface of the earth. SPF and PA helps indicate and
estimate the time required to reach the maximum amount of UV to which you
should be exposed in any specific weather condition.


Knowledge and style of UVindeSirWith UVindeSir, you can choose what kind of SPF to use based on the measurement. City-wide UV numbers are usually available every day, but they can be quite broad and unspecific. In addition, that will (of course) tell you nothing about the UVI in your position or other places you visit. For some, the UVindeSir and associated app will be the best thing since sliced bread (or the introduction of iPhone – your choice).

Tips will tell you how to doYou
can measure the UV radiation from the sun and temperature when and where you
like. The UV Index can vary widely depending on the following factors: time of
year or season, time of day, weather conditions, surfaces, altitude, and regions
of the world. Note that the real-time value measured probably differs from the regular renewed value from a forecasting service. This is caused by the
sun’s changing position, clouds, altitude, season, and other factors. UV Index
and temperature are changing all the time and you can use UVindeSir to track them.
It is helpful for you to make decision and limit your exposure to these harmful
UV rays.

<p>If you’ve got a wireless charger, you probably know how frustrating it can be to make sure your phone’s charging coil is lined up perfectly with the charger. Move your phone slightly off center, and charging can slow down or simply stop. But it doesn’t have to be this way! Our magnetic locking interface ensures your mobile phone always snaps into optimal charging position, whether it’s in portrait or landscape mode.</p>

<h2>Engineering &amp; Design Process</h2>
<p>We started our mission to solve the problem of empty battery by exploring all the available wireless charging technologies and standards, and in the end decided to go with Qi technology as it is the most reliable and widely used among global smartphone manufacturers (Samsung, Nexus, Apple Watch, etc.). When designing XVIDA Wireless Chargers, there were quite a few challenges. The first was how to achieve fast charging and eliminate overheating, but still keep the charging unit very small and compact. This was problematic, because when the components are packed very closely together to reduce size, the result is overheating. And the second was how to combine our existing magnetic mounting system with inductive charging components, but at the same time prevent the magnetic field to decrease the efficiency of inductive charging.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>We solved these problems by developing our very own wireless charging components, and by successfully isolating the magnetic field. The solution was then tested for several months and optimized until we achieved the charging rate, equal to the speed of wired charging and overheating was completely eliminated. The result is a complete system of Qi wireless charging accessories, designed according to the standards, developed by Wireless Power Consortium's specifications. Magnetic locking ensures effortless positioning and ensures your phone always aligns in an optimal horizontal/vertical position that allows for a constant maximum transfer of power to the battery.</p>

<h2>Who we are </h2>
<p>We're a team of young, driven individuals who believe in constant innovation, European design &amp; craftsmanship, high quality manufacturing and providing a superb customer experience. We are based in beautiful Ljubljana, Slovenia and sunny Los Angeles, California. We started XVIDA because we wanted to be able to do more with our favorite mobile devices, and because we believe mobile accessories should be versatile, easy to use, well made, durable and, above all, beautifully designed. </p>

</div></div>","After more than a year of hard work, we are finally ready to introduce our latest project!  Meet the first truly useful smartphone mounting system with extremely fast Qi wireless charging! Mount it, charge it, love it! 










Incredibly Fast Charging for iPhone and Android (Qi enabled phones)
XVIDA Wireless Chargers are equipped with a next generation US Texas Instruments chip and proprietary electronics that allow for maximum transfer of power from charger to your phone. This allows us to provide a constant charge at an incredible 0.970A current which is almost 50% more than standard Qi chargers and almost identical to the max. possible iPhone wired charging current of 1A. In other words, it provides wireless charging that’s just as fast as an old-school cable, but with all the extra benefits of next-generation wireless charging.




Universal Mounting and charging
Already own a Qi- enabled smartphone? Then check out StickyPad, our universal magnetic adapter that allows your device to become compatible with all XVIDA Wireless Charging accessories. Simply apply StickyPad to the back of your phone and you will be able to magnetically connect to and charge your phone with XVIDA Mounts & Wireless chargers.





Flawless positioning- 100% Reliability
If you’ve got a wireless charger, you probably know how frustrating it can be to make sure your phone’s charging coil is lined up perfectly with the charger. Move your phone slightly off center, and charging can slow down or simply stop. But it doesn’t have to be this way! Our magnetic locking interface ensures your mobile phone always snaps into optimal charging position, whether it’s in portrait or landscape mode.

What is the woodster?woodster is the natural solution of getting your iMac or Thunderbolt Display to a new level of view. Have you ever suffered from neck pain caused by not having the ergonomically optimal seat/desk-relation? Do you need your iMac or Thunderbolt Display in a higher position?woodster made from local German wood lifts up your iMac or Thunderbolt Display to a higher position so you can work more comfortably. Even if you have never had neck pain issues, the woodster will add a modern natural touch to your working area.
Your woodster can be combined with two front 3.0 USB ports which make it easier to connect your USB-Drive on the front rather than on the back of your iMac or Thunderbolt Display. Are there different wood types?
We would like to make it easy for you to choose the right wood-type that matches your work area. Three different wood-types can be chosen, each one in three different heights (3cm / 5cm / 8cm).Which height do I need?
The perfect height for you depends on your chair-table combination. To help you find the height you need, open this page and follow the instructions. What does ergonomic mean?
Ergonomic denotes the relation between your chair, your table and your monitor resulting in your sitting position which is important for your well-being. Sub-optimal combinations can lead to pain in the neck, the shoulders or the back. woodster might help you improve your individual ergonomic working position. You have to consider that this is not a guarantee but a possible solution. Many factors contribute to your personal working place being ergonomic and healthy.
Just try it yourself.

Does it support my iMac/TBD?
During the future order process you can choose your iMac version (starting with iMac produced in 2009) and you will get the woodster matching exactly the stand of your iMac. Thunderbolt Display from 2011.

My iMac/TBD has no USB 3.0, can i use the USB-Version?
Yes, of course! USB 2.0 is also supported. It is just not as fast as USB 3.0 ;)

Are there different colors?
As the woodster is a natural product, we leave the wood as it is cut from the tree. Simple and beautiful. However, as there are three different wood-types, you can choose the type that is right for your iMac.How can you contribute?Branding

Every woodster gets a branding with our name holzgefuehl. Each branding is unique and will have a special look.

 All of the stepsWhy does the project need 6.000€ to get started? 
Some things need to be purchased in a package of more than one hundred, for example the USB Ports. To get a good price I would need to order more than 500 pieces at once. Here are some more examples:

Product Packages
Packaging material
Wood in the three different types
In order to provide the woodster for this reasonable price, we need to produce at least more than 20-30 at the same time.

Hevo can detect intruders EVEN if your alarm is not armed.<div>

<br/><p>With a smart phone device, you can control the lights, door locks, and electrical outlets in your entire house. HEVO allows you to create a series of commands that HEVO will execute. You could create a good-night scene that will turn on/off all lights, televisions and close all of the window treatments in the entire house. All that with a single click!</p>
<p></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>RETROFIT TO ANY ALARM SYSTEM</b></p>
<p>Control your existing alarm system with your smart phone and/or create a scene that would involve your existing alarm system. HEVO has the capability to connect directly to the BUS (communication system) of your current alarm system. This allows HEVO to be aware of any possible threats.</p>

<br/><p>Most alarm system owners think that having an central alarm connection is imperative, what they don't know is that the alarm system relies on a single wire that is accessible outside your home. In the event, that the wire is cut or dysfunctional, HEVO with PATROL is still protecting your household.</p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""></span></p>
<p>PATROL is the operating system that drives HEVO. We developed an
advanced OS that enables HEVO to be smarter and more clever.  PATROL
offers a two way monitoring system. PATROL is installed on every HEVO and also
installed on our server that monitors every HEVO installed in real time.</p>
<p></p>
<p>PATROL allows four (4) levels of security if a threat is detected:</p>

<p>PATROL can detect intruders EVEN when your alarm is not armed. PATROL
has the ability to detect family members inside the house. If PATROL detects movement
and no family member is present, it will trigger stage one and alert you of a possible
threat.</p>

</div></div>","How many of you have an alarm system but forget to arm it before leaving the house? Hevo can detect intruders EVEN if your alarm is not armed.
You have an alarm system and would like to add smart home features like controlling your lights or locking your door with the press of a button. With Hevo, you can keep your current alarm system and add new age technologies.

SMART HOME CONTROLLER


With a smart phone device, you can control the lights, door locks, and electrical outlets in your entire house. HEVO allows you to create a series of commands that HEVO will execute. You could create a good-night scene that will turn on/off all lights, televisions and close all of the window treatments in the entire house. All that with a single click!


RETROFIT TO ANY ALARM SYSTEM
Control your existing alarm system with your smart phone and/or create a scene that would involve your existing alarm system. HEVO has the capability to connect directly to the BUS (communication system) of your current alarm system. This allows HEVO to be aware of any possible threats.

PATROL: THE OPERATING SYSTEM TO BEAT!


Most alarm system owners think that having an central alarm connection is imperative, what they don't know is that the alarm system relies on a single wire that is accessible outside your home. In the event, that the wire is cut or dysfunctional, HEVO with PATROL is still protecting your household.

PATROL is the operating system that drives HEVO. We developed an
advanced OS that enables HEVO to be smarter and more clever.  PATROL
offers a two way monitoring system. PATROL is installed on every HEVO and also
installed on our server that monitors every HEVO installed in real time.

PATROL allows four (4) levels of security if a threat is detected:

                                                       
PATROL will try to send the alarm
signal from your alarm system through the Internet; If for any reason, that level
failed it moves to LEVEL 2.

                                                        
PATROL will try to send the alarm signal from your alarm system through GSM / Cellular Network. If for any reason, that level failed it moves to LEVEL 3.

                                                        
We monitor in real time each and every HEVO installed. If we detect that one HEVO is not connected, we alert you and/or the emergency services. 

                                                        

PATROL can detect intruders EVEN when your alarm is not armed. PATROL
has the ability to detect family members inside the house. If PATROL detects movement
and no family member is present, it will trigger stage one and alert you of a possible
threat.


RADIO FREQUENCY (RF)
HEVO can control any device that operates at 315 MHZ. It has the ability to learn and send RF signal.
HEVO can control:


All of your window treatments
Fireplaces
LED Strips
Any other device that operate at the 315 MHZ


ADVANCED SMART PHONE APP.

We developed an advanced smart home application that will be available on Iphone or Android. Within that application you can control lights, audio-video equipment, create scenes...

CONTROL AUDIO-VIDEO

Say goodbye to clutterIt's never been easier to access the right key. The Ekster Key Holder organizes all your keys in a compact, silent stack, which you can flip through with just one hand. Say goodbye to keys jingling in your pockets, or jabbing you in the leg.  2. Never lose your keys againLost your keys? Just ring them, or locate them on a map using your phone, Google Home, Alexa or Siri. You'll receive alerts if you leave them behind, and you can use the tracker to ring your phone too. Bonus: use the tracker as a remote control for group selfies.  3. Let there be lightA built-in LED light ensures that you'll always find the right key and that you won't scratch your car or door in the dark. The light flashes when you ring your keys, so you'll be able to find them even in the darkest of corners.    4. Carry smarterThis Key Holder stores 3-8 keys comfortably and is built for easy assembly on the go; no tools necessary. It comes with a magnetic add-on, allowing you to attach larger keys (like car keys) without the hassle.       Track Record   The Key Holder

 TimelineWe're almost ready to go on this project. We have our mass-production plants up and running; we've tested these products for several months, and we're good to go. All we need to start mass production is funding. Prototyping Ekster products are designed to hit the perfect balance of minimalism and function. We conducted thorough market research on current products like this. It was an extremely challenging project to conceptualize, with hundreds of other key organizers on Kickstarter alone.Our process involved a lot of prototyping, working with 3D-printed micro-iterations in-house, and collaborating with engineers in other continents to design the best product possible. We were lucky to have a team that worked with us to push every possible millimeter, helping us to build the world's thinnest key tracker.   Thank YouHere at Ekster, we're in the business of making your life easier. We started with upgrading the traditional leather wallet, making it easier to use and harder to lose. You trusted us during our first three campaigns, and that's a big part of why we're back here today with another essential upgrade: the Ekster Key Holder and Tracker.In the last four years, we've gone from a dorm room in America to an office in Amsterdam's biggest tech hub; from a team of four to twenty employees; from an idea to the world's largest smart wallet brand. And we couldn't have done it without your support. After years of hard work and dedication, we’re once again ready to show you why you made the right choice in backing us.       Shipping Our community's everywhere, and we ship almost everywhere too. Our worldwide shipping covers over 150 countries. Please note: in some rare cases you will be responsible for duties, fees, and taxes applicable to your region or country. For the EU and North America, all duties will be covered by Ekster.This is a new project, built on the same philosophy we've always had: total transparency with our backers. We'll keep you updated every step of the way; we've learned a lot of lessons from three successful campaigns, so we know what you need to feel confident in this project. Since our last campaign, our team is bigger, our planning has improved, and we've nurtured strong ties with our fulfilment companies. We also thought ahead by ordering the materials for this project in advance, so everything's in place to get your products to you on time.We're serious about quality control, and we stand by our products. If an issue occurs, we'll always replace products that have manufacturing defects. Please note: only products with manufacturing defects can be exchanged. We cannot give refunds, but we do offer store credit. Feel free to reach out to us at nest@ekster.com with any questions! Complete your order 1) After your order, we'll send you a Backerkit Survey. You can pick out the color you want, add any other products you'd like, and confirm your address.2) Your bank account or Paypal will be charged for your products. If you added any additional products through Backerkit, you'll be charged for those a few days later.3) Your order is marked ready to ship as soon as you complete your survey. We'll keep you in the loop about the status of your shipment through our campaign updates.4) We'll send you a tracking number as soon as your package is on its way to you.Need help?

<h3>About Folktek and production:</h3>
<p>Over the years, there has never been any folktek work created with an initial production run of greater than 25. In fact, many folktek works are historically entirely one of a kind. Some, like the gardens (illuminist, luminist and micro) have gone through several small production runs of 25 or less created at one time over the course of months, while some others have taken just as long or longer to create a run of just 10!</p>
<h4>How this piece differs slightly from other Folktek works;</h4>
<p>This Conduit is offered here to help with production. Your contribution will determine the number of instruments being made. Currently 50 instruments are in production and set to be complete and ready to ship just 2 weeks after this short 2 week campaign. If just ten were to sell, we'd buy the parts needs for all 50 and stop production there. If people want more, we can make more.</p>
<p>The cost of the Conduit is low compared to other folktek works because we've dedicated ourselves to extending production, while still not overextending ourselves into mass-production (something we've always strayed away from). Our goal is set low because the funds needed to finish these works is for small parts like quality knobs and house-made lamps.</p>
<p>________________________</p>

<h3>Spead the word:</h3>Save 20 bucks by referring someone. If you buy a Conduit, tell someone else to buy a conduit and if he/she writes your name ""message to campaign team"" on the perk contribution page, we'll refund you $20 via paypal when all is said and done. One referral refund per person. But please, refer lots of people.<br/><p>________________________</p> </div> <div> <h3>Keeping it simple:</h3> <p>We're keeping this campaign simple - no stickers, no downloads, no extra doodads...Just the quality built instrument.</p>
<p>Pay for one Conduit at this initial discounted price, get one. Want more than one? double the price, do the math and add it to the total on the total on the contribution page. Please include a ""message to campaign team"".</p>
<p>If you missed this, the Conduit will be available in limited quantities after this campaign is finished at a price of $449 via <b><a href=""folktek.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">folktek.com</a></b>.</p>
<p>Funding goes into production. 50 are ready to ship once the parts we need to buy are placed on the panels.</p>
<p>If we happen to exceed 50, we're set to go into further production - from the pcb manufacturing and part mounting, to the panel drilling and the woodworking. Files, Jigs and materials are ready to go. Beyond 50 to the next 50, the wait will be 1 month from the end of this campaign to ship. If, by chance, we exceed that amount, we'll be prepared to handle the higher load and the wait will jump by 2 additional weeks.</p>

<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>The initial 50 are in production now. Should we exceed 50, we are prepared to go into a larger production and hire a couple folks for the weeks after the campaign ends. Any delays will only come from pcb manufacturing and assembly. However, if it becomes clear we'll need more circuitry as the campaign goes on, we'll begin producing them preemptively.</p>

If you buy a Conduit, tell someone else to buy a conduit and if he/she writes your name ""message to campaign team"" on the perk contribution page, we'll refund you $20 via paypal when all is said and done. One referral refund per person. But please, refer lots of people.________________________   Keeping it simple: We're keeping this campaign simple - no stickers, no downloads, no extra doodads...Just the quality built instrument.
Pay for one Conduit at this initial discounted price, get one. Want more than one? double the price, do the math and add it to the total on the total on the contribution page. Please include a ""message to campaign team"".
If you missed this, the Conduit will be available in limited quantities after this campaign is finished at a price of $449 via folktek.com.
Funding goes into production. 50 are ready to ship once the parts we need to buy are placed on the panels.
If we happen to exceed 50, we're set to go into further production - from the pcb manufacturing and part mounting, to the panel drilling and the woodworking. Files, Jigs and materials are ready to go. Beyond 50 to the next 50, the wait will be 1 month from the end of this campaign to ship. If, by chance, we exceed that amount, we'll be prepared to handle the higher load and the wait will jump by 2 additional weeks.
________________




    Risks & Challenges The initial 50 are in production now. Should we exceed 50, we are prepared to go into a larger production and hire a couple folks for the weeks after the campaign ends. Any delays will only come from pcb manufacturing and assembly. However, if it becomes clear we'll need more circuitry as the campaign goes on, we'll begin producing them preemptively.

lighter than traditional filter holder. And it is much easier to set up. It only

<h2>Effects</h2>
<b></b><strong>Polarizer (C-PL) </strong>oblique reflections from non-metallic surfaces, can darken the sky in colour photography , and can saturate the image more by eliminating unwanted reflections.</div>

<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1224803/files/20150216005027-6983948349_8f9e990c80-01.jpg?1424076627"" src="""" style=""width: 531.376623376623px; height: 386px;""/></p>

</div>
<div>
<b>Color Filters</b> are widely used in Black and White photography and portrait photography. <b>Yellow </b>can absorb blue light, darkening the sky to more closely match what the eye would see. <b>Orange </b>reduces the appearance of freckles and blemishes, giving the skin a healthy, smooth look. <b>Red </b>can give bold and dramatic effects to many photographs and marked penetration of haze and fog. <b>Green </b>is mainly used for photographing plants as it helps separate the green foliage from the brightly-coloured flowers and buds. <b>Blue </b>can really add “mood” to a photograph and reduced contrast can be useful for giving a shot a calm, soothing atmosphere. </div>
<div>

<br/>
</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>
<b><strong>Variable ND Filter (</strong>VND) </b>works by placing two polarizing filters together at least one of which can rotate. The rear polarizing filter cuts out light in one plane. As the front element is rotated, it cuts out an increasing amount of the remaining light the closer the front filters comes to being perpendicular to the rear filter. The advantages to this are that you get multiple ND filters in one package.</div>

Famous YouTuber Nitsan Simantov


""It has potentially less reflection and flaring than most front mounted filter ""Famous Blogger Wim Arys""The build quality looks and feels excellent and all parts are made from aluminium. The adapter lens mounts look high quality and durable, no lens wiggle here.""https://www.wimarys.com/deo-tech-owl-filter-adapter-review/For more information : http://www.deoinfinity.com/Usage's FeaturesOWL protect your camera sensor from dust, water and oil drops without
affecting photo quality and have
the effect you want at the same time. 




It is very easy to clear the filter. And because of it, Using OWL can avoid any damage by scratching while
clearing. All we need is only to insert a filter. 


It also can substitute the rear cap to protect the rear lens while we
take off the lens.





In another case, even if all of our lenses are
in the same ring size, we tend to buy a filter for each lens because changing
filter is really tired and time wasting. 
Large filters are very
expensive, but OWL is only using 52mm filter. It makes OWL save so much cost not only in avoiding buying numerous filters, also in using large
filters.






The above special lens are impossible to install filters in traditional way. It limits the creativity of photography. However, OWL breaks
it through. Only take one step to install OWL. We can create the effect we want
easily. Nothing can limit our imagination anymore.












OWL is much smaller and
lighter than traditional filter holder. And it is much easier to set up. It only
takes one simple step to change filter. We will no longer feel troubled to
reset the setting of filter after change lenses. With OWL, setting of
adjustable filter, can be kept when change lens. Work efficiency will be
greatly improved with OWL.







Click to Enlarge
Lens Mount, Tripod Mount, Filters Holder, and Filters,
all above are changeable in OWL, Hundreds combinations to aim your unique
situation. More useful accessories are coming.



Filters

Filter is the heart of OWL. The quality of filter will definitely influence OWL directly. To create magical effects, we are
choosing series of high quality filter for you carefully. You can use the filters we provided to achieve below effects freely.




Effects
Polarizer (C-PL) oblique reflections from non-metallic surfaces, can darken the sky in colour photography , and can saturate the image more by eliminating unwanted reflections.






Color Filters are widely used in Black and White photography and portrait photography. Yellow can absorb blue light, darkening the sky to more closely match what the eye would see. Orange reduces the appearance of freckles and blemishes, giving the skin a healthy, smooth look. Red can give bold and dramatic effects to many photographs and marked penetration of haze and fog. Green is mainly used for photographing plants as it helps separate the green foliage from the brightly-coloured flowers and buds. Blue can really add “mood” to a photograph and reduced contrast can be useful for giving a shot a calm, soothing atmosphere. 








Variable ND Filter (VND) works by placing two polarizing filters together at least one of which can rotate. The rear polarizing filter cuts out light in one plane. As the front element is rotated, it cuts out an increasing amount of the remaining light the closer the front filters comes to being perpendicular to the rear filter. The advantages to this are that you get multiple ND filters in one package.

<span style='color: rgb(106, 106, 106); letter-spacing: 0px; font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;'>I have been working on custom made loudspeakers for over 25 years.

</li>
<li>
<p>Together with an innate and nostalgic passion for traditional and classic décor, the idea of lighting, together with technology, both as a vital need as well as a form of art, has enabled the rise of a new, captivating series of exquisite products, characterized by nostalgic designs combined with long-lasting high quality materials.</p>
<p>Since 1980s I have worked for myself as a qualified customizer of home audio products, and by 1987, I had already started creating my own finished products. </p>
<p>Later, due to high market competition, I accepted to move on, and started work at a very big and nearby, loudspeaker manufacturing company. Eventually the company also closed down. </p>

<p>The product will start up as a High End Lamp with usb ports, but, will eventually evolve into other possibilities. Additional high end audio, omnidirectional, active speakers and even wireless audio capabilities are some of the ideas my contributors will help me achieve by launching this product. </p>
</li>
</ul>
</div><div> <ul> <li>
<p>Because I place particular value on the appearance and quality  built of these products, aswell as their performance capabilities, I will need to buy and test new and different paints, glues, cables, power supplies for the 3 or more independent usb ports. And to be able to keep costs to a minimum I have to order, in some cases, more than one item.</p>
<p>The value I am asking for is for the development and the manufacture of the first products</p>
<p>Only the glass crystal, which is supplied locally, all other materials will be either ordered from other countries (eg: alcantara is from Italy) or from suppliers that I will have to choose and hand pick, personally. This will imply some travel and a lot of time.</p>
</li> <li>This will be an unique Lamp, handcrafted to order for each clients choice in either color or finish materials. The aim is to reach a worldwide recognition and clientele!</li>
<li>The risks in achieving this piece of functional art, are practically non existent.  There may be some glue that might react negatively on a particular color. There may be a problem with the heating up of some power supplies inside a closed environment, but after the developing stage, all these risks will be solved,</li> <li>The funds will go into the development of the product, even if I don't reach my entire goal. The only difference is, that I will not be able to dedicate 100% of the time on the project and my own funds will only allow me to proceed at a much slower pace.  </li>

The product will start up as a High End Lamp with usb ports, but, will eventually evolve into other possibilities. Additional high end audio, omnidirectional, active speakers and even wireless audio capabilities are some of the ideas my contributors will help me achieve by launching this product. 


  
Because I place particular value on the appearance and quality  built of these products, aswell as their performance capabilities, I will need to buy and test new and different paints, glues, cables, power supplies for the 3 or more independent usb ports. And to be able to keep costs to a minimum I have to order, in some cases, more than one item.
The value I am asking for is for the development and the manufacture of the first products
Only the glass crystal, which is supplied locally, all other materials will be either ordered from other countries (eg: alcantara is from Italy) or from suppliers that I will have to choose and hand pick, personally. This will imply some travel and a lot of time.
 This will be an unique Lamp, handcrafted to order for each clients choice in either color or finish materials. The aim is to reach a worldwide recognition and clientele!
The risks in achieving this piece of functional art, are practically non existent.  There may be some glue that might react negatively on a particular color. There may be a problem with the heating up of some power supplies inside a closed environment, but after the developing stage, all these risks will be solved, The funds will go into the development of the product, even if I don't reach my entire goal. The only difference is, that I will not be able to dedicate 100% of the time on the project and my own funds will only allow me to proceed at a much slower pace.",0.0,0,"4 Campaigns

<p><strong><strong>BEST IDENTITY THEFT PROTECTION EVER!  Tired of a wallet full of cards with PIN numbers for SECURITY, those frustrating usernames and passwords for SECURITY, and what about cloud storage SECURITY, all of which don't really work?</strong></strong></p>
<h2><strong>Help Is Almost Here!!  But we need YOU to get The Community Card on the open market!<br/></strong></h2>
<h3><strong>What is The Community Card?</strong></h3>
<p>The Community Card is a smart card, that works with apps capable of securing passwords, financial accounts, PIN numbers, and medical information for an individual, a spouse, and up to three children. Parents can have identical cards storing the entire family's medical information. Additionally, a child or elderly dependent can be issued his own card storing only his information, which is helpful when parents are not present.</p>
<p>The Community Card is unique and provides identity theft protection by encrypting and splitting sensitive data, i.e. account numbers, then storing the split data in separate locations - part on the card and part in the cloud. If the card is lost or stolen, no one can benefit from the encrypted and split account data contained within the card. The Community Card is powered by Exodus technology and works like a safety deposit box with two keys. To retrieve and unite the stored data pieces, the system requires your Community Card and confirmed identity--your BioPIN.  <em>This level of security has never been available to consumers, until now!</em></p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What is the BioPIN?</h3>
<p>A BioPIN is a secret PIN number which the customer does not have to remember created from the customer's fingerscan image.  </p>
<p>Exodus uses an algorithm to map a biometric image, like points on a graph. Then, the map (or points) is turned into a BioPIN (personal identification number) and the image is discarded. The BioPIN is stored in a database instead of the biometric image, and is never stored with account or credit card numbers. Unlike PIN numbers that people memorize and share, a BioPIN can only be generated by the original biometric image being presented, which is read by a finger scanner and compared to a BioPIN on file.  See video for details. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>Current Apps</strong></h3>
<p><strong>The Medical App</strong> is consumer friendly and securely stores your personal information--like prescriptions, allergies, and general medical history--that you may need to have handy in case of an emergency or a simple visit to your physician’s office. Medical providers, schools, and daycare facilities can easily accept your card just by registering and purchasing an inexpensive smartcard/fingerscan reader. No additional fees are incurred to read your medical information. Optionally, consumers can print their information to hand deliver to their physician. You can easily change your personal information by using a PC or a smart phone and logging into the web.</p>
<p><strong>The Financial Account App</strong> allows you to safely store all of your checking, credit and debit card and PIN number information all on one card. When using your Community Card your account numbers are never seen by clerks. With full market penetration you will be able to leave your other cards at home. Additionally, you can give children access to accounts and assign spending limits without ever giving PIN numbers away. With a smartcard/fingerscan reader at home you will be able to shop on line and never again worry about someone stealing your account numbers. Because all transactions are secure, merchants who accept The Community Card will receive reduced fees on processing through approved credit card processors.</p>
<p>This card is different than others because the information is locked away and YOU are the only one that is able to control the stored data and how the data is used. The Community Card offers a level of security that is better than anything on the market to secure your information.</p>
<h2><strong>WE NEED YOUR HELP TO:</strong></h2>
<p>1.  <strong>Port the health application to a mobile first responders unit.</strong>  Many first responders have shown interest in The Community Card but they need a unit that is mobile and easy to use for emergencies and natural disasters.  The unit we have chosen to build our application on is inexpensive, yet very durable.</p>
<p>2.  <strong>Build a Password Storage &amp; Use App.</strong>  We want The Community Card to be very useful to you while we build market share.  The Medical Storage App is useful to you right now.  But, by adding a consumer friendly Password Storage and Use App, your card will become valuable and useful to you on a daily basis. Retailers and medical providers already like The Community Card, but to help drive market share, they want to know that consumers value and use their card every day.  The Password Storage App will accomplish this goal with security not currently available in the market place. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What will the password storage application hold?</strong></p>
<p>You will be able to store site links, usernames, passwords, special tokens you may have to remember, security questions, and a contact number.</p>
<p><strong>How will the password application work?</strong></p>
<p>When logged into The Community Card web portal, you will see an application called “Password Storage and Links”. The application will contain links and a help button for your favorite sites. The links can be used for easy access to these sites. Additionally, if you need any security information, as long as your card is present and in the reader, you will be able to click on the help button and your information will be retrieved from your card, reassembled, and displayed. This will eliminate your need to search for usernames and passwords. Additionally, this app could be further developed by the IT community to enhance security of single sign-on applications.</p>

<h2>FAQs:</h2>
<h3>Is there a problem with the cloud?</h3>
<p>No, actually the cloud is good and allows our information to be accessible when you need it.  How is storage currently a problem?Most products store sensitive information in one location.  For example, storing consumer’s financial accounts in a database so the consumer does not have to re-enter account information when shopping on line the next time.  While this is convenient, it leaves the consumer vulnerable if the company’s database is breached.  Consumer information can be stolen from 3rd party intrusion or simply from a disgruntled employee.</p>
<h3>How does The Community Card solve the storage problem?</h3>
<p>The Community Card solves the storage problem because sensitive data is never stored in one location.  The information is always encrypted and then split with  part being maintained by the consumer in The Community Card and part being maintained on the host database.  Neither part is useable or readable without the other part; therefore the consumer always maintains control of their own information.</p>
<h3>What are the security risks for credit/debit cards?</h3>
<p>The most important factor in protecting your security and preventing identity theft is ensuring YOU are the only one given access to YOUR information.  Current credit card designs, including the new EMV design, stores personal information on the card and assumes the consumer has control of his/her cards.   However, when the card is stolen the information is vulnerable and easily accessed.   Consumers are required to remember PIN numbers that have been added for security, but these are often stolen and can be manipulated on the cards themselves. </p>
<h3>How does The Community Card solve security problems?</h3>
<p>The Community Card requires the consumer to authenticate their identity as the true card owner by using a fingerscan which is unique to them.  The fingerscan is turned into a BioPIN and the BioPIN is stored with a random number assigned to The Community Card.  This number is stored on the host system and never on the card.  Systems that store both the account information and BioPIN on the card leave the consumer extremely vulnerable if the card is stolen.  Additionally, the BioPIN is never associated directly to anyone's account information because the account information is split between the card and the cloud.  </p>
<h3>Why is The Community Card useful to employers, daycares, and schools?</h3>
<p>Employers are looking for inexpensive ways to offer benefits to employees.  The Community Card is a benefit for both employees and employers. Securing passwords in the workplace does not need any explanation. However, The Community Card Medical app is a benefit also.  Employers are often concerned about work related accidents and when an employee is hurt at work, up-to-date accurate emergency medical information becomes essential.  Accurate information prevents errors and can reduce workers' compensation cost.  However, many employers do not want to store medical information because of liability and security risks.  The Community Card solves this problem by allowing employees to have emergency medical information available when they need it. A priceless benefit. Daycares and Schools have similar problems.  If a child is hurt on the premises, having up-to-date and accurate information can save lives. </p>
<p>The Community Card allows parents to easily update and maintain accurate emergency information for their children, and allows daycares or schools to access this information in a secure manner if the child is hurt while in their care.  Parents who have children with even slight medical needs are concerned about proper care when their children are not with them. Additionally, The Community Card is proving to help in situations where parents speak a different language.     </p>
<h3>How secure is this system?</h3>
<p>Exodus’ technology uses the highest standards applying recognized industry practices. Military grade encryption is used throughout the data transmission and data storage sections of the system.  Exodus does not store account numbers in the system.  The Community Card offers consumers a level of security superior to other methods available. </p>
<h3>How does Exodus’ biometric recognition work?</h3>
<p>Exodus uses an algorithm to map a biometric image, like points on a graph.  Then, the map (or points) is turned into a BIO PIN (personal identification number) and the image is discarded.  The BIO PIN is stored in a database instead of the biometric image, and never stored with account or credit card numbers.  Unlike PIN numbers that people memorize and share, a BIO PIN can only be generated by the original biometric image being presented, which is read by a biometric scanner and compared to a BIO PIN.Are you keeping fingerprints in your database?No. Using a mathematical formula, the unique fingerprint design of each individual is converted into a numeric code, or secret BioPIN. This secret BioPIN is saved in the database. The actual image of the fingerprint is not saved. </p>
<h3>Which smartcard/fingerscan readers work with The Community Card?</h3>
<p>Futronics FS82, Secugen ID-USB/SC, Sagen Morphotrak MSO350 and 1350.</p>
<h3>How can my business accept The Community Card for payments?</h3>
<p>Send us an email at <a href=""http://mailto:payments@exodusps.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">payments@exodusps.com</a> and we will send you  information. The process of registering a business to accept payments is easy and your business can begin to save money within weeks.</p>
<h3>Who do I contact if I want to accept The Community Card for medical emergencies?</h3>
<p>Send us an email at <a href=""http://mailto:medical@exodusps.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">medical@exodusps.com</a> and we will send you the information to become a medical information partner which will allow you to read The Community Card's medical information when authenticated by the consumer.   </p>

</p><h3>Who am I?</h3>
<p>I am an electronics engineer that works designing heavy construction machinery and as a hobby wants to design and manufacture electronic gadgets. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong style=""font-size: 1.17em;""><strong>What does your product do?</strong></strong></p>
<p>In short: it lets <a href=""http://www.arduino.cc/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Arduino</a> 'talk' on the phone. You know those sounds you hear when you press buttons on your phone? Those are <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual-tone_multi-frequency_signaling"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">DTMF</a> or touch tones. Arduino cannot make sense of those 'noises'. My DTMF Module let Arduino 'talk' that language. That is, my module takes those sounds and let Arduino know which button you pressed. Also, my module let Arduino generate those tones.

<h3> </h3>
<h3><strong>Why a campaign and Why important?</strong></h3>
<p>My goal is to have a production run of the DTMF modules that I designed and built prototypes. I want to gain experience in turning an idea into a product that is available to everyone at a reasonable cost.</p>
<p>This is my first crowd-funding project! Contributors will help me execute my plan and will enable me in the future to have other crowdfunded embedded projects of increasing complexity. In other words: I want to start small, with something I'm really confident I can achieve.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>What I need?</h3>
<p>So my goal is to raise enough funds so that I can contract a company to manufacture and assemble the boards. In order to have a cost effective production run I need a batch size of at least 100 units. My estimate expense for this project is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Printed Circuit Board:  $200</li>
<li>PCB Assembly: $400</li>
<li>Components: $200</li>
<li>Fees &amp; Overhead: $100 to $200</li>

<h3><strong>FAQ from potential donors.</strong></h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Q: Are these machines less costly than existing computers?</p>
<p> </p>
<p><em>A: These systems will be competitive for cost / performance. ($1,100 to $1,300) depending on memory and hard drive size.</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Q: Are they faster?</p>
<p> </p>
<p><em>A: Going green is not going to be a punishment. We will not sacrifice speed for fake gains in efficiency.</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Q: What is the benefit to the consumer besides helping the environment?</p>
<p> </p>
<p><em>A: It won’t just be that we are carbon neutral we will also be wallet neutral. Our “secret sauce” will be that while the environment is always a great tag line to advertise, the difference between our systems and someone else’s will be that the energy savings will pay for our systems through its life.</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Q: You have created a colorful computer. Do you think it will sell?</p>
<p> </p>
<p><em>A: It sets us apart from other companies and it’s also a very functional case for heat dissipation and efficiency. We like to think of it as beauty and form meets function.</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Q: Are your computers available in any colors other then green?</p>
<p> </p>
<p><em>A: Yes they are. For our first year we are offering them in stone gray as well as green.</em></p>
<p> </p>

</div></div>","FAQ from potential donors.
 
Q: Are these machines less costly than existing computers?
 
A: These systems will be competitive for cost / performance. ($1,100 to $1,300) depending on memory and hard drive size.
 
Q: Are they faster?
 
A: Going green is not going to be a punishment. We will not sacrifice speed for fake gains in efficiency.
 
Q: What is the benefit to the consumer besides helping the environment?
 
A: It won’t just be that we are carbon neutral we will also be wallet neutral. Our “secret sauce” will be that while the environment is always a great tag line to advertise, the difference between our systems and someone else’s will be that the energy savings will pay for our systems through its life.
 
Q: You have created a colorful computer. Do you think it will sell?
 
A: It sets us apart from other companies and it’s also a very functional case for heat dissipation and efficiency. We like to think of it as beauty and form meets function.
 
Q: Are your computers available in any colors other then green?
 
A: Yes they are. For our first year we are offering them in stone gray as well as green.
 
Q: Have you created a face book page for this?

Green PC
A project by Thomas Henz and Krisztian Katona, their dream is to create an environmentally friendly computer company with goals of carbon neutrality. They also feel progress doesn’t have to be at the expense of the planet, and they are here to offer you that solution.
 
Green PC is based upon simple guiding principles:
 • Being environmentally responsible does not have to be a sacrifice
 • Environmentally friendly, low power full feature computing
 • Renewable and recyclable sources
 • Carbon neutrality
 • High quality, performance, stylish, affordable machines
 
What is Green PC?
The concept for Green PC is simple; a low power computer containing quality parts and materials from environmentally friendly sources such as factories compliant with ROHS (Restriction of Hazardous Substances) and low or no carbon emissions. All from a company that aims to be the first completely green computer manufacturer.
 
What are we going to do differently?
 
When you purchase a Green PC, we will offer to recycle your old computer for free and a tree / trees will be planted at our own expense to offset any carbon released during the production and lifetime of your new computer. Each year, we will strive to improve our product, increasing energy efficiency and the appeal of the low power full featured desktop pc. We shall maintain a commitment to overall quality and to the community by creating jobs here in the US, and if there is a better, cleaner, or greener way to do it, we will find it.
Our computers will be attractive and well put together; our cases have a foot print of only 8x8x16"" and are specially designed to optimize cooing efficiency by way of specialized cooling elements and maximizing air flow. In addition our hardware will be optimally calibrated for maximum cooling efficiency. Bamboo will be featured heavily in our products and where ever possible, as it is far more renewable and environmentally friendly than plastic.
                        
 
Why Indigogo?
The reason that we are asking for crowd sourced startup capital, is that we feel that to allow investors into this project would cause us to lose a degree of control that could negatively impact the operation and goals of this venture due to outside influence (silent partners end up being not so silent); In other words, for this to work we feel that it must remain as close to its lofty ideals as possible.
 
What do we get out of this campaign? 
The purpose of this campaign is to raise the capital to make this Goal a reality. The funds will be used to cover start up expenses such as producing our prototype, buying our domain, paying for our website, and incorporation. Once we have our prototype and have shown what we can do, we will start our marketing campaign to fund the first run of machines.

<p>Using a simple and quick 2-piece design, the Shell2D installs on your iPhone as easy as 1 – 2 – 3! Simply slide the phone onto the Lightning adapter and fit snugly into the case. Then, add the protective bumper for 4 corner drop and bump protection. Because the case is made of advanced polymer plastics rather than metal, it prevents audio interference for clear calls.</p>

</div>
<p>Even though the Shell2D is incredibly thin, we knew that having a convenient mounting solution for driving was essential so we added a version with a built-in magnetic insert for mounting on metal surfaces. Together with a customized car mount that fits any vehicle, the Shell2D allows your phone to safely and securely mount in a convenient viewing location for hands-free calls, messages and navigation. 
Since the Shell2D carries its own power supply with it everywhere it goes, it eliminates the need for cheap aftermarket car chargers and the tangle of cables that go with them. With the Shell2D your car stays clean and clutter free.</p>

</div></div>","Introducing Shell2D
Let’s be honest, few things in life are as truly frustrating as running out of power on your smartphone. It always seems to happen at the worst time and can cause lost connections, lost time, and lost money! It's a pain that we can all relate to and that's why the Shell2D battery case is the answer for all iPhone 6/6s users who want to free themselves from one of life’s most common irritations.
Presenting the Shell2D, the first in a line of intelligent smartphone battery cases that represent the latest in Slim Power technology to keep your phone safe, secure and full of juice!







A case that was not only thin, but also made from the highest-quality durable materials, with a unique magnetic frame built-in!... allowing your phone to sit easily in many environments, such as your car!





A case that allows you to get rid of the tangled lines while you are driving. 





Take A Closer Look:
Shell2D not only supports the most common features, but comes with a few unique ones too!





 Easy Installation





Using a simple and quick 2-piece design, the Shell2D installs on your iPhone as easy as 1 – 2 – 3! Simply slide the phone onto the Lightning adapter and fit snugly into the case. Then, add the protective bumper for 4 corner drop and bump protection. Because the case is made of advanced polymer plastics rather than metal, it prevents audio interference for clear calls.
A Thinner Profile





The Shell2D is almost twice as thin as similar cases from Apple and at less cost. This ultra-slim design makes it perfect for comfort and easy to access from a pocket or purse.
Built-in Magnetic Insert






Even though the Shell2D is incredibly thin, we knew that having a convenient mounting solution for driving was essential so we added a version with a built-in magnetic insert for mounting on metal surfaces. Together with a customized car mount that fits any vehicle, the Shell2D allows your phone to safely and securely mount in a convenient viewing location for hands-free calls, messages and navigation. 
Since the Shell2D carries its own power supply with it everywhere it goes, it eliminates the need for cheap aftermarket car chargers and the tangle of cables that go with them. With the Shell2D your car stays clean and clutter free.
2400mAh On-board Battery





The highly efficient on-board battery effectively doubles the use time of your iPhone which means more talk time, video or internet browsing for you.  
One Button Charging





The Shell2D lets you choose when and where you re-charge your phone. Simply press a button and Shell2D does the rest. Is your friend’s iPhone dead? You can save the day by using your Shell2D on your friends iPhone 6!
LED Power Indicator





No more wondering if your backup power is ready or not, a multiple LED readout tells you at a glance how much power is available in your Shell2D.
Home Charging Dock





Your phone and Shell2D will remain charged and safely stored at home or the office with the handsome, low profile home charging dock which uses a standard Lightning cable to keep your Shell2D ready to go. 

A Wild Splash of Colors





Choose your color, choose your style. Our four colors: Space Black, Light Pink, Coral Blue and Royal Blue give you the chance to let your individuality shine.
Recharge with Lightning Cable




No more proprietary cables, connections or adapters. The Shell2D recharges using any certified Lightning cable without removing the phone from the case. Your Shell2D and phone will be powered up and ready when you are.

And, A Few More Things:
Protective Test





Material Test





 Fit Your Pocket 





Help make Shell2D a reality with your pledge!

[ANE] USB Serial for Android - Adobe Native Extension

Our principal motivation for creating this native extension is to exploit the great possibility to connect mobile apps to serial enabled devices, for example: Arduinos, LCD screens, Serial to USB adapters and more, this coupled with the Adobe AIR platform that allows compile a project for iOS and Android, open a world of possibilities for apps developed in the Flash Platform.    
What is an AIR native extension?
""Native Extensions for Adobe AIR are code libraries that contain native code wrapped with an ActionScript API. Native extensions provide easy access to device-specific libraries and features that are not available in the built-in ActionScript classes. Examples of native extensions include making a mobile device vibrate, integrating ad-networks and in-app purchasing systems into your games, and using the iOS Game Center in your iOS games.""

<p>Being able to view one-side of someone's earlier video-conversation to you, an on going dialogue or business meeting, in the ""now time!""<br/></p>
<h3>Short Scenario</h3> <p></p>
</div><i>Imagine you and your two business partners have a meeting and all of you are  located around the world in different timezones. The problem is you now have to find a time that works for all three (3) of you - spread across three (3) continents. What a hassle perhaps, and each of you have very busy daytime operations. <br/><br/>Well with ThymeWarp that problem can be now easily solved. Even though when it is 4 p.m. in Japan for instance, and to one of your partners in USA it's 3 a.m in New York but it is 7 a.m. in London. You can send them one video message and they can reply back to it when either they wake at 7 a.m. in the morning, or later that day. For your third business partner maybe he or she will be busy at 10 a.m. and needs to prepare when they saw the message come through but now at noon over lunch he of she can catch up and reply back to the same message also. This is the power behind ThymeWarp. You can have a delayed conversation or conversations anywhere, anytime but they appear the same as if they were all in realtime. </i><i>There will be no more having to base your conversations around a clock, carry on with your day and get to the conversation at the time that is most convenient to you.  </i><div>
<div><i><br/></i></div>
<div>
<i><b>Social Scenario:</b> <br/>Imagine wanting to speak with family members spread across time zones, or friends spread across different break times in your day? You send a </i><i>ThymeWarp video conversation to all of them in just one moment, they see your conversation when they have their break. <br/><br/>One conversation can be sent to one, two or more friends or family members at the same time instance, and when they find time they can all get back to you at different times. <br/><br/>ThymeWarp allows you to no longer have to wait until each person has a break to conduct a phone conversation, it allows each party the convenience of not missing an important moment with you or you not being able to share your important moments by let others become part of it as well. </i><i><br/><br/><b><br/>ThymeWarp</b> is what ""Selfies"" sometimes wish they could be, except <i>""Selfies"" are ""still life</i>."" There are many other apps with similarities qualities to a ThymeWarp but where ThymeWarp differs is it focuses on the simplicity of just letting you record your own video conversation and sending it in whole through ThymeWarp Servers who are registered to receive it. People in your social or business group only, who have already been setup as designated receivers by you and are part of your circle of friends, so you only select one, few or all when you press send. </i>
</div>
<div><i>Perhaps ThymeWarps can also be used to accumulate special memories, moments you wish to have captured and  preserved over time so that they can be brought back to life whenever everyone is together. For this one reason answers why ThymeWarp conversations should never be stored on ThymeWarp servers, and ThymeWarp servers should remain configured so that ThymeWarps all operate purely in fast dynamic RAM and shadow memory which are used for transmitting them as fast as possible to your receiver's devices as soon as they come in. This is also why you must store them, in order to keep the special ones you want to keep, and discard the ones you choose not to keep and ably save room in your storage.</i></div>
<div>
<i>Lastly, ThymeWarp is not a ""do everything"" app server, it is designed to one thing and that one thing extremely well.  In business as with social, ThymeWarp is different and unique from other apps because it is being designed to place quality first, then expand. Every smartphone or smart device comes with a video recorder, so there is little need for ThymeWarp to create one, and the simplicity is to use what you have differently and cost effectively with the highest quality.<br/></i><br/>This <b>Thyme-Warp</b>⫀ miracle (<b>code named P4</b>), is a video conversation app service (VCS), with apps for computers, smartphones and smart devices. We will have a limited launch date of January 15th, and from set-up fess have a broad world-wide launch within 30 - 45 days following the limited launch date. This will be the testing date for a live ""dry-run"". Soon after they will be available for everyone in a limited capacity for three months, and after in a full capacity in three countries. <b><br/><br/>ThymeWarp</b> will not and does not use advertisers, does not collect personal data, and will always be free to use, why?  <b>ThymeWarp</b> is simply an awesome global telecommunication tool, a Time-Router which allow you to send video conversation only to your friend who are registered in your social group and no one else. This provides the user a way of connecting with others anywhere in the world ""free of costs"", ""free of loss of privacy"" and ""the freedom to communicate for as long and for as often as you like"".  <i>As technically capable people, it is the least we can do towards achievement of a greater good. Hope others will catch on to this wave!</i><br/><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1126998/files/20150102044419-T_H_Y_M_E_W_A_R_P___4___Lecture-sm.png?1420202659"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/>The <b>ThymeWarp</b> services &amp; Apps run on technology you already have. ThymeWarp cuts your phone costs by using the Internet like a Skype, and increases the inherent quality of how you connect with others.  What started as a fun project called <b>""project four</b>"" or P<b>4</b>,  grew into what may very well become a new generation in the telecommunication of how we communicate. <br/><br/><h2>T-Apps</h2>C-<b>U</b> - Receiving earlier sent video conversation from a Social Group Member<br/><b>U</b>-C-<b>Me</b>-C-<b>U</b> - You see Video recording of my response to your Video-conversation.<br/>C-<b>ALL</b><br/>C-<b>ALL</b>-C-<b>U</b>s <br/><b>ALL</b>-C-<b>U</b>s-C-<b>Them</b><br/><br/><br/>Today P<b>4 is </b>running on five (5) high performance servers. This is the ThymeWarp P<b>4 </b>service and P<b>4's ""</b>C-<b>U</b>"" ""C-<b>Me</b>"" Apps project. Applets being designed to use their own Internet protocols so that your conversations can be as long as you would like them to be, without limits of how long. (This is why we think you would like to help us develop this phenomena, and create a whole new way of social interaction in today's complex society.) We could use your financial help, and you will receive unlimited suppiy of finish-product apps as we design more to accompany this service,<br/><br/>Each computer server has quad-core CPUs, (4 brains per chip) and high speed Ethernet connections with dual network service providers connect-ups for fail-safe connections. These servers are where we run and provide ""the ThymeWarp"" routing service, <b>the core</b>, that allows people to connect and send out video conversations across the internet back and forth in  zone free space, thus replacing the need every time for toll phone calls which costs money. P<b>4</b> is free, and we think it should remain free because it is made from “white noise” technology (technology you already have in use and already owned by you for other purposes).    <br/>                                    <br/>     The ThymeWarp Cloud         <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1077206/files/20141207000654-5-Start-servers.png?1417939614"" src="""" style=""width: 611.507px; height: 288px; cursor: nw-resize;""/><br/><b><br/><b>Brief Introduction and Background.</b><br/></b>Hello, I am Ernst B. 
Carter, an innovator accredited with 8 patents: (3) in the USA, (1) in 
Canada, (2) in Japan, (1) in Israel, and (1) in China. I am excited to 
introduce a new way millions of people will choose to connect and 
communicate using the same devices we already use, but in a different 
way.  While I am currently responsible for setting up, managing and 
directing operations for Exit-Cube (Hong Kong) Ltd. a Patent Technology 
&amp; Licensing Firm preparing to conduct business in the China, it 
recently occurred to me how a <b>ThymeWarp</b> would ease the pains of 
Spam-emails, Mal-tweets, and harmful images posted places we wish not to
 see, when we just wish to communicate with those we know and love. Well
 this is the new telecommunication service called ThymeWarp which allows
 everyone affordable communication across the Internet in ways that 
increases quality of conversation and cost nothing to use. <b><br/>My Aerospace Career &amp; Background:</b> <br/>My background in computer science started in California,  an Aerospace Company named Rockwell International (later acquired as part of The Boeing Company). I handled assignments for missile guidance and control systems' BMO program: (a.k.a. Peacekeeper MX missile during the 1980s).  Completed five Aerospace projects during my tenure of 1984 to 1991, as an Aerospace Systems Engineer, and was often drafted by other managers for lead and revival of difficult projects that ran into trouble. <div><ol>
<li>Rescued an <b>Expert Test &amp; Diagnostic System</b> for guidance computers, although successful, required serious ingenuity for redirection; <br/>
</li>
<li>Spent three years under design and development of a <b>Radiation Hardening &amp; Assurance Test</b> project, which also required a major overhaul and re-invention to increase both performance and accuracy within budgetary guidelines. As an engineer nothing generates more pride than completion. </li>
</ol></div>
<div>
<b>Inventions</b><br/>Two Aerospace Inventions, both successfully proven, yet losing one to internal politics at the hands of a high-ranked mentor, led to my resignation from aerospace to start my own companies. </div>

<p><i></i>                                      Est.d Net Earnings<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b><i>Summary of Financial Analysis:</i></b><br/></p>
<p><i>We anticipate a wide acceptance of this new service in parts of Western Europe, and especial in parts of Asia where easy access to the Internet is norm, and eventually in other parts of the world as services become more popular by word of mouth. We won't advertise and we will not use advertisers, but we will need to be ready to embrace demand growth. <br/></i></p>
<i>
</i><p><i>Sales are automated through Paypal, and registrations need to be automated through computers, so we need your support to put these systems in place. Our financials are based upon the most conservative model, however this whole operation will probably go ""viral"" since it's proven the first of its kind.</i></p>
<i>
</i><p><i>Our charts may seem impressive even though they are built from very conservative growth estimates, because the growth of a truly great free service may be very difficult to predict. The Chart above is taken from  a linear growth forecast, one which takes five (5) server user capacity and start at 2% of this capacity for the first month using number of users and their registration fees in social categories only. Each month following, growth is 150% of the month before across twelve months. For example, five servers with maximum capacity set at 200 society groups of 40, will be 8,000 users. 2% would be 160 different users, and 8 different Society Group Administrators(SGAs). The next month at 150% rises to 240 users and 12 Society Group Administrators. </i></p>
<i>
</i><p><i><b>One-Time Set-up Fees are:</b></i></p>
<i>
</i><ol>
<li>
<i><b>Society Group Administrator</b> - someone who can invite others, and who can start a group: A one-time Setup Fee:   $2.50 <br/></i>
</li>
<li>
<i><b>Society Member</b> - someone who gets invited into a societal group by Society Group Administrator: A one-time Setup Fee:   $1.50 <br/></i>
</li>
</ol>
<i>
</i><p><i>Business Society Groups are divided into three categories: Small to Medium Enterprises Society Group - 20 (SME-20s), Small to Medium Enterprises Society Group - 40 and Large Corporate Conglomerate Society Group - 200 (LCCSG-200). All work a little differently as businesses from the social classes and therefore must purchase the entire group of sizes 20, 40 and 200 under each SMEs and LCCSGs before filling them with members. This is advanced fee revenues for P<b>4</b> and will largely be the revenues which replaces any need for advertisers. At any time the only charge will be a one time fee for self registration which provides an avoidance use of any information of any kind albeit private or non-private, the one-time fee creates a contractual bond between P<b>4</b> and the users to maintain security and information privacy within each society. No other fees are required, and fees act as the contract between the user and P4, which is why they are so small.</i><br/></p>

</div></div>","Working PrototypesA Video Conferencing Remote Health Care Application See Future Health Care Application for THYMEWARPFirst ThymeWarp PrototypesFrom Concept below to Working Prototypes above, ThymeWarp now exists as it is a system of integrated services place all into one new App. We Define a ThymeWarp As:
Being able to view one-side of someone's earlier video-conversation to you, an on going dialogue or business meeting, in the ""now time!""
Short Scenario 
Imagine you and your two business partners have a meeting and all of you are  located around the world in different timezones. The problem is you now have to find a time that works for all three (3) of you - spread across three (3) continents. What a hassle perhaps, and each of you have very busy daytime operations. Well with ThymeWarp that problem can be now easily solved. Even though when it is 4 p.m. in Japan for instance, and to one of your partners in USA it's 3 a.m in New York but it is 7 a.m. in London. You can send them one video message and they can reply back to it when either they wake at 7 a.m. in the morning, or later that day. For your third business partner maybe he or she will be busy at 10 a.m. and needs to prepare when they saw the message come through but now at noon over lunch he of she can catch up and reply back to the same message also. This is the power behind ThymeWarp. You can have a delayed conversation or conversations anywhere, anytime but they appear the same as if they were all in realtime. There will be no more having to base your conversations around a clock, carry on with your day and get to the conversation at the time that is most convenient to you.  


Social Scenario: Imagine wanting to speak with family members spread across time zones, or friends spread across different break times in your day? You send a ThymeWarp video conversation to all of them in just one moment, they see your conversation when they have their break. One conversation can be sent to one, two or more friends or family members at the same time instance, and when they find time they can all get back to you at different times. ThymeWarp allows you to no longer have to wait until each person has a break to conduct a phone conversation, it allows each party the convenience of not missing an important moment with you or you not being able to share your important moments by let others become part of it as well. ThymeWarp is what ""Selfies"" sometimes wish they could be, except ""Selfies"" are ""still life."" There are many other apps with similarities qualities to a ThymeWarp but where ThymeWarp differs is it focuses on the simplicity of just letting you record your own video conversation and sending it in whole through ThymeWarp Servers who are registered to receive it. People in your social or business group only, who have already been setup as designated receivers by you and are part of your circle of friends, so you only select one, few or all when you press send. 

Perhaps ThymeWarps can also be used to accumulate special memories, moments you wish to have captured and  preserved over time so that they can be brought back to life whenever everyone is together. For this one reason answers why ThymeWarp conversations should never be stored on ThymeWarp servers, and ThymeWarp servers should remain configured so that ThymeWarps all operate purely in fast dynamic RAM and shadow memory which are used for transmitting them as fast as possible to your receiver's devices as soon as they come in. This is also why you must store them, in order to keep the special ones you want to keep, and discard the ones you choose not to keep and ably save room in your storage.

Lastly, ThymeWarp is not a ""do everything"" app server, it is designed to one thing and that one thing extremely well.  In business as with social, ThymeWarp is different and unique from other apps because it is being designed to place quality first, then expand. Every smartphone or smart device comes with a video recorder, so there is little need for ThymeWarp to create one, and the simplicity is to use what you have differently and cost effectively with the highest quality.This Thyme-Warp⫀ miracle (code named P4), is a video conversation app service (VCS), with apps for computers, smartphones and smart devices. We will have a limited launch date of January 15th, and from set-up fess have a broad world-wide launch within 30 - 45 days following the limited launch date. This will be the testing date for a live ""dry-run"". Soon after they will be available for everyone in a limited capacity for three months, and after in a full capacity in three countries. ThymeWarp will not and does not use advertisers, does not collect personal data, and will always be free to use, why?  ThymeWarp is simply an awesome global telecommunication tool, a Time-Router which allow you to send video conversation only to your friend who are registered in your social group and no one else. This provides the user a way of connecting with others anywhere in the world ""free of costs"", ""free of loss of privacy"" and ""the freedom to communicate for as long and for as often as you like"".  As technically capable people, it is the least we can do towards achievement of a greater good. Hope others will catch on to this wave!
The ThymeWarp services & Apps run on technology you already have. ThymeWarp cuts your phone costs by using the Internet like a Skype, and increases the inherent quality of how you connect with others.  What started as a fun project called ""project four"" or P4,  grew into what may very well become a new generation in the telecommunication of how we communicate. T-AppsC-U - Receiving earlier sent video conversation from a Social Group MemberU-C-Me-C-U - You see Video recording of my response to your Video-conversation.C-ALLC-ALL-C-Us ALL-C-Us-C-ThemToday P4 is running on five (5) high performance servers. This is the ThymeWarp P4 service and P4's ""C-U"" ""C-Me"" Apps project. Applets being designed to use their own Internet protocols so that your conversations can be as long as you would like them to be, without limits of how long. (This is why we think you would like to help us develop this phenomena, and create a whole new way of social interaction in today's complex society.) We could use your financial help, and you will receive unlimited suppiy of finish-product apps as we design more to accompany this service,Each computer server has quad-core CPUs, (4 brains per chip) and high speed Ethernet connections with dual network service providers connect-ups for fail-safe connections. These servers are where we run and provide ""the ThymeWarp"" routing service, the core, that allows people to connect and send out video conversations across the internet back and forth in  zone free space, thus replacing the need every time for toll phone calls which costs money. P4 is free, and we think it should remain free because it is made from “white noise” technology (technology you already have in use and already owned by you for other purposes).                                             The ThymeWarp Cloud         Brief Introduction and Background.Hello, I am Ernst B. 
Carter, an innovator accredited with 8 patents: (3) in the USA, (1) in 
Canada, (2) in Japan, (1) in Israel, and (1) in China. I am excited to 
introduce a new way millions of people will choose to connect and 
communicate using the same devices we already use, but in a different 
way.  While I am currently responsible for setting up, managing and 
directing operations for Exit-Cube (Hong Kong) Ltd. a Patent Technology 
& Licensing Firm preparing to conduct business in the China, it 
recently occurred to me how a ThymeWarp would ease the pains of 
Spam-emails, Mal-tweets, and harmful images posted places we wish not to
 see, when we just wish to communicate with those we know and love. Well
 this is the new telecommunication service called ThymeWarp which allows
 everyone affordable communication across the Internet in ways that 
increases quality of conversation and cost nothing to use. My Aerospace Career & Background: My background in computer science started in California,  an Aerospace Company named Rockwell International (later acquired as part of The Boeing Company). I handled assignments for missile guidance and control systems' BMO program: (a.k.a. Peacekeeper MX missile during the 1980s).  Completed five Aerospace projects during my tenure of 1984 to 1991, as an Aerospace Systems Engineer, and was often drafted by other managers for lead and revival of difficult projects that ran into trouble. 
Rescued an Expert Test & Diagnostic System for guidance computers, although successful, required serious ingenuity for redirection; 

Spent three years under design and development of a Radiation Hardening & Assurance Test project, which also required a major overhaul and re-invention to increase both performance and accuracy within budgetary guidelines. As an engineer nothing generates more pride than completion. 


InventionsTwo Aerospace Inventions, both successfully proven, yet losing one to internal politics at the hands of a high-ranked mentor, led to my resignation from aerospace to start my own companies.

Patents and Patent Pending Applications


The Thyme-Warp⫀ (C-U C-Me) Today

Self Authentication

P4 Thyme-Warp⫀ is a global Video Conversation Technology Service with Apps that uses a long lineal decent of Exit-Cube’s Patented and Patent-Pending Security technology dating back as far as 2001, in San Francisco California. For Social and Business Group Authentication, administrators first are fully authenticated, then they can add whoever to their micro-societies. They simply present the potential member with a TW-Key to allow the member to register for their society. Even if someone registers for the group, family group, or social friends group, they cannot be registered until invited by administrator who must present them with a key to register. Administration of groups are performed usually by the members who register and form a particular business or social society group. All members including the administrator self-authenticate themselves so we are never provided their names or birth dates or any form of information other than a username, and key for the authentication module we run on ThymeWarp computers. ThymeWarp computers use technology from  US Pat 8,219,823 Technology incorporated into the operating systems and a Security Operating System called ""EOS"", Patents US 7,810,133 & US 8,407,761 technology. (see diagram above).

Great For Family Sharing Moments!
ThymeWarp Services are excellent for Family Groups Imagine presenting a discussion with someone who is out of the office, and doing so with a clarity cover a number of points, well a video conversation not only means you do not have leave a flat voice mail and wait a call back, you cover all the points and expect results.                        An Excellent way to have a video conversation with extended family, in-laws, parents, grandparents, friends and other couples. Quick, effective and more fun!
                                 
ThymeWarp Services are excellent for socially responsible parentsTeens during impressionable years need to communicate, with the ThymeWarp Service, they get the chance to select a complete telecommunication network for specifically for their friends. Should one person decide not to continue to engage as a member, simply cancel their registered device without fee to no longer receive video conversations from and within that particular group. The loner can choose to start a new social group and invite new and different friends. Social Bullying can only be performed by invitation only, whereas even if invited, no one is forced to choose to register for such a social group.               

ThymeWarp Services are excellent for Young AdultsOften times, young adults who wish to communicate intimately between one another try to find creative ways to cut costs, and in this case ThymeWarp would be awesome because it allows people to become closer with the burden of costs and or distance.ThymeWarp Services are excellent for University and College StudentsDistance is always a factor in student life, and often times this factor is present in all aspects of the student life in the same way as budgeting money. ThymeWarp provides an awesome new foundation upon which could start a new wave of how we choose to bridge the gaps of time, distance and costs, and students would provide the wider range of early adopter to this service, to explore the many benefits from which they could gain aside from just cutting costs.
ThymeWarp(s) are excellent for Keepsake Memorable(s) ?We don't pretend to know what people will want to do with ThymeWarp, we do not pretend to be that smart, but what can be done is ThymeWarp can also create a ""ThymeCapsule"" for memories on your storage, or Grandmother's storage to be retrieved in private and played over and over again on computer. Moments which can live forever in the privacy of your home or environment, but not on our servers!Simply Imagine The Magnitude of ( what you can help us achieve!)An Alternative for Teenager online bullying and (The Friday Night Solution) with spent with Friends.  ThymeWarp can simply present alternative choices for ways to connect online (with their real friends) across our ThymeWarp Solution. My team and I are humbled by what we are sure the impact P4 will have on the solution for the problem of online Bullying. No one should have to endure this inhuman treatment, regardless of where. Our approach is simple, an alternative form of connecting with others offers a greater solution against online abusers in all global communities, even brings a limits SPAMs, and provides choice over unwanted exposures to negative materials from the Internet at large.  Offers a variety of greater quality for all of those who value maintaining their privacy. Why should your age be calculated by the Internet as if you need to be tracked for some reason? Global governments appear spellbound to legislate control, while bystanders feel helpless when witnessing atrocities committed by those who lack the decency and respect for human life.  An impact of a P4's ThymeWarp can now level the plane for the Good to no long stand by idle but embrace a choice of action. P4 provides both parents and loved ones - a choice with a tool to either to do nothing or increase the quality in how we choose to connect with others by limiting ourselves to those we allow to connect with us. Define our micro social societies from ground up.Almost All Initial Equipment For Starting-up ThymeWarp System!
          
My Launch Date Check List Includes Cisco Router:CISCO2911-SEC/K9 Cisco 2911 SECURITY BUNDLEWe could use your help as a community, but you have my word. This project is so very interesting, even without your help we will make it happen! Exit-Cube made another large investment in the ThymeWarp program to bring it forward, so we were able to adjusted our goal.
Limited Launch Date: January 15 2015CEO Track RecordToday Eight (8) Patents granted for Inventions, with six patents that will become part of P4's ThymeWarp and used to secure data and provide self authentication protection.

University Mainframe Migration Project 1991. Took assignment to migrate University Data Sets from mainframe computers to distributed networks for three University departments under Provost. Led efforts on design from concept to point of ""going live"" on ARPANet (pre-Internet) with a 100% accuracy completion. Introduced scaled growth designs to cut costs, and succession follow-on phases to conserve spending. Provided a solution estimated at $580,000 US by their Computing Center, for phase I at 80% for $59,000 US, which included all key and necessary equipment forming a base for Phase II. Performed all within 4 months, which had been estimated to take up to five years.
Successful patented inventions which are used today in familiar operating systems and mobile phones operating systems around the world. (sensitive issue).


Video Conversation Transaction Security



P4 Society Group Administrators (SGAs) invite friends into their Society, each SGA is issued 40 keys at the time SGA registers for setting up a group or groups which we call societies. Each SGA authenticates self and only then can the SGA sets up the Social, Business or Professional Society Group members. Each key is encrypted by a society group code and can only work with and for that specific society group. When a friend or member joins, the SGA must issue one of the Society Group's keys, and only then can the friend use the same key to obtain membership rights to register with ThymeWarp for that specific society group, otherwise by registering with ThymeWarp, the only option would be set up an independent Social Society Group which means become a SGA and inviting the original SGA to join this group. (Bullying is filtered by this passive construct, where the Bully often times will have null memberships in their group). ThymeWarp receives each key and match it to SGA's Society's Group, and only then permits a member's registration to proceed as a member of the particular Society's Group.Our Security Restores Confidence in Both Privacy & Data SecurityThe use of patented technologies with the ability to secure both privacy and security integrity for your transmission data, P4 uses US Pat 8,219,823 Technology for self-authentication incorporated into the operating system which is also a Security Operating System called an Encrypting Operating System EOS based on US Patents 7,810,133 & US 8,407,761, Israel Patent 167014, and Japan Patent 4777651 Technologies which secures data and will restore confidence in doing just that.To support this effort, bringing privacy back to social connections, we need your extreme support, and in return we will be a bit more than happy to show an extreme generosity, not just once but continuously.Risks & Challenges.Qualifications for overcoming risk pale in comparisons with those who only take calculated risks,  nonetheless my qualifications stand out over the norm. ThymeWarp is ""a walk in the park!"" Many concepts and technology required make ThymeWarp work as well or better than my very first invention has been around for over two decades.  There are no tremendous hurdles that can't be overcome. Let's face it, it is not expected to be simple but after clearly researching the entire concept from front to back the only risks assessed were whether people would like to have it free or not.  Campaign Team.

The Business Side of P4
Financial ChartsSet-up fees Estimates' say Break-Even (in 4 Months)                    Social Societies Registration Fees Only
                                      Est.d Net Earnings

Summary of Financial Analysis:
We anticipate a wide acceptance of this new service in parts of Western Europe, and especial in parts of Asia where easy access to the Internet is norm, and eventually in other parts of the world as services become more popular by word of mouth. We won't advertise and we will not use advertisers, but we will need to be ready to embrace demand growth. 

Sales are automated through Paypal, and registrations need to be automated through computers, so we need your support to put these systems in place. Our financials are based upon the most conservative model, however this whole operation will probably go ""viral"" since it's proven the first of its kind.

Our charts may seem impressive even though they are built from very conservative growth estimates, because the growth of a truly great free service may be very difficult to predict. The Chart above is taken from  a linear growth forecast, one which takes five (5) server user capacity and start at 2% of this capacity for the first month using number of users and their registration fees in social categories only. Each month following, growth is 150% of the month before across twelve months. For example, five servers with maximum capacity set at 200 society groups of 40, will be 8,000 users. 2% would be 160 different users, and 8 different Society Group Administrators(SGAs). The next month at 150% rises to 240 users and 12 Society Group Administrators. 

One-Time Set-up Fees are:



Society Group Administrator - someone who can invite others, and who can start a group: A one-time Setup Fee:   $2.50 


Society Member - someone who gets invited into a societal group by Society Group Administrator: A one-time Setup Fee:   $1.50 



Business Society Groups are divided into three categories: Small to Medium Enterprises Society Group - 20 (SME-20s), Small to Medium Enterprises Society Group - 40 and Large Corporate Conglomerate Society Group - 200 (LCCSG-200). All work a little differently as businesses from the social classes and therefore must purchase the entire group of sizes 20, 40 and 200 under each SMEs and LCCSGs before filling them with members. This is advanced fee revenues for P4 and will largely be the revenues which replaces any need for advertisers. At any time the only charge will be a one time fee for self registration which provides an avoidance use of any information of any kind albeit private or non-private, the one-time fee creates a contractual bond between P4 and the users to maintain security and information privacy within each society. No other fees are required, and fees act as the contract between the user and P4, which is why they are so small.

<p>Cocoon's Subsound® technology profiles infrasound and audible sound waves to create a protective 'cocoon' inside your home. Subsound® allows Cocoon to detect activity well beyond the room you place it in, through walls and on other floors.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The study of low-frequency sounds (below 20Hz) outside the range of human hearing, or 'infrasonics' has long been used by seismologists for earthquake detection and geologists to study rock formations deep within the earth.</p>
<p>The same technology used to detect shock waves travelling through the planet can now be used to detect movement throughout your home.</p>
<br/><p>With built-in machine learning, Cocoon understands what activity in your home is normal, so when an unusual event occurs you can be alerted and take action.</p>

<p>We want to make homes safer with a simple yet powerful solution that is truly effective.</p>
<p>We've been working on Cocoon since the start of the year and now need your help to set up our manufacturing and tooling. We are dedicated to transforming home security and need your support to build a community not just a company.</p>
<p><b>Why support us</b></p>
<ul>
<li>You don't use the security you have or don't have any useful security.</li>
<li>You love to know what's happening in your home when you're out and about or away for long periods.</li>
<li>You love great design and want to be the first to have an iconic home security device.</li>
</ul>
<p style=""padding-bottom:10px;"">Your money will only be used to build your product - all funds pledged will be ring-fenced for tooling and component costs only.</p>

<p>We've developed our prototype that with your help and the team we've assembled should mean that we successfully deliver on our plans. We are at an early stage in our development and we may find that through our testing and refinement process that unanticipated problems occur.</p>
<p>We are manufacturing in our home country (United Kingdom) to reduce some of the risks. However bringing any new idea to market results in unforeseen issues which we will endeavor to minimise to ensure Cocoon is delivered according to our planned schedule.</p>
<p>Some of the issues which may be challenging are below:</p>
<p><b>FCC and CE testing</b><br/>The device has to meet FCC and CE certification standards, but until the final prototype is built we will not be able to do the actual testing. This may mean we need to revise the electronics to pass the tests, which could cause delays.</p>
<p><b>Sourcing</b><br/>We have identified and are working with our manufacturing partners and component suppliers, but until we know from this Indiegogo project how large our first production run will be we can't get delivery commitments or finalise our negotiations with the manufacturers.</p>
<p style=""padding-bottom:10px;""><b>Manufacturing</b><br/>Although we have developed multiple software businesses in the past and have experience of hardware products, manufacturing isn't without risks. One key challenge is quality control. We have decided to produce the first production run locally to minimise the manufacturing risks, by being close to the manufacturing process we can ensure tight feedback loops and personal involvement in quality control.</p>

<p><b><br/></b></p>
<p><a name=""FAQwork"" rel=""nofollow noopener""></a><b>How does Cocoon work?</b></p>
<p>Cocoon detects activity in the home using its built-in infrasound and other sensors (motion detection, audible sound analysis) and uses machine learning algorithms to separate activity that is normal for your home that you might like to know about. We call this technology Subsound®. <br/><br/>Cocoon connects over the internet via our cloud service to your smartphones using geo-fencing to determine who's at home. This presence information is combined with learning your schedule to identify unusual events that occur - e.g. a front door being opened downstairs when the family are in bed or an unknown person moving through the property when you are away from the home. There's no need to create traditional 'zones' that you get in standard alarm systems or for the installation of other sensors.<br/><br/>Cocoon sends notifications of unusual events to your smartphone from which you can access live and recorded audio and video from your home. If you have a large property and you want greater camera coverage then more than one Cocoon can work together to provide this.</p>
<p><a name=""FAQhear"" rel=""nofollow noopener""></a><b>How does Cocoon hear activities in a home?</b></p>
<p>If you picture your house as being underwater, you can see that a door opening or closing upstairs or a person moving around will make the water move in various ways around the house.  The same effect happens with the air in your house. An appropriate sensor can detect the air pressure changes or 'ripples' which correspond to activity in the home.</p>
<p>Cocoon is packed full of high quality sensors that it uses to detect these ripples caused by activity in the home and convert them into digital signals. Each action is different and creates its own digital signature, like a fingerprint, that Cocoon uses to build profiles for what is normal in your home.</p>
<p><a name=""FAQnohear"" rel=""nofollow noopener""></a><b>If humans can't hear infrasound, how can Cocoon? </b></p>
<p>Humans hear within the audible range of 20Hz - 20kHz but infrasound is classified as sound below that of human hearing (below 20Hz). Cocoon uses a powerful microphone to detect infrasound.</p>
<p><a name=""FAQwhatsub"" rel=""nofollow noopener""></a><b>What is Subsound® and how is this different from infrasound?</b></p>
<p>Subsound® is the combination of sound wave detection (audible, and infrasound), digital profiling and machine learning. Subsound® lets Cocoon detect and make sense of the noise created by activity throughout your home so it can notify you if anything unusual happens so you can take action.</p>
<p>Infrasound is simply a frequency of sound wave so low (&lt;20Hz) that we can't hear it. Infrasound can be created by many things in and around the home but on its own it has a very low chance of correctly indicating unusual activity.</p>
<p><a name=""FAQwhysub"" rel=""nofollow noopener""></a><b>Why is Subsound® better at home monitoring than other technologies?</b></p>
<p>Subsound® technology enables Cocoon to detect and profile activity throughout the home without the need for additional sensors. This means that you only need one small Cocoon device in order to keep the typical home or apartment secure, eliminating the need for expensive wired home security systems and you don't have to remember to arm or disarm it.</p>
<p>Subsound® gives the peace of mind that the whole home is actually safe whereas regular smart cameras can only protect what they can see and suffer from false positives (e.g. rapidly changing light levels in the room monitored or vehicles passing outside).</p>
<p><a name=""FAQwind"" rel=""nofollow noopener""></a><b>Will Cocoon work in areas with high infrasound presence, like homes next to wind turbines?</b></p>
<p>Yes, Cocoon is smart enough to learn what is normal for your home and only triggers when an unusual event occurs within the walls of your home.</p>
<p>The term ""Infrasound"" on its own refers to any low-frequency sound waves. Just as our ears and brain can tell the difference between the audible noise of door closing and a train rumbling past, the sensors and software in Cocoon can tell the difference between the infrasound profile of a moving door and a wind turbine.  </p>
<p><a name=""FAQcanrec"" rel=""nofollow noopener""></a><b>Can Cocoon recognise off-schedule or irregular events in a home?</b></p>
<p>Yes. Cocoon actually works by understanding what is normal in your home and then notifying you when unusual (irregular) activity occurs.</p>
<p><a name=""FAQnormal"" rel=""nofollow noopener""></a><b>How does Cocoon know which sounds are “normal” and which constitute a security threat? Will Cocoon alert users to abnormal sounds that are not security threats, like accidentally dropping a bottle on the floor?</b></p>
<p>Cocoon continually analyzes the readings from its sensors. A notable audio event can be processed to extract an audio ""fingerprint"". Different kinds of sounds, for example, jangling keys, the click of a door or loud music from next door all have different fingerprints.</p>
<p>In this way, Cocoon can turn the raw stream of audio data into a more comprehensible stream of events, with associated data. These events can then be analysed to discover patterns, as Cocoon learns what is normal for your household. This analysis is then used to build a model of what events are expected, tailored to your specific household.</p>
<p>With this model, augmented by information from your mobile app about when you are home or away, Cocoon can decide if a sensor event is likely to be significant, and show it to you.</p>
<p>Over time Cocoon adapts to your home, learning new profiles and adapting to your routine. You can also indicate to Cocoon that a type of unusual event reported to you is OK.</p>
<p><a name=""FAQenable"" rel=""nofollow noopener""></a><b>How do users enable Cocoon's security features when they leave home?</b></p>
<p>Cocoon automatically detects when you are at home and when you have left using geo-fencing on your smartphone so there is no need to arm or disarm it. You can check in on your home any time using the Cocoon mobile app, streaming HD video and audio straight to your smartphone, trigger the built-in siren or contact the Police.  </p>
<p><a name=""FAQmulti"" rel=""nofollow noopener""></a><b>Can Cocoon accommodate multiple-occupancy, multi-user households, in which occupants come and go at different times?</b></p>
<p>Yes. Just install the app on each authorised occupant's phone and Cocoon will know who is at home and behave accordingly.</p>
<p><a name=""FAQentire"" rel=""nofollow noopener""></a><b>How can only one Cocoon listen to and protect an entire house?</b></p>
<p>When any wave fits through a gap it will spread out a bit.  The greater the wavelength, the more it will spread out.  Because the 'ripples' or waves of air pressure changes Cocoon monitors are of very low frequency they spread out a lot allowing them to travel a long way around a building, even though the tiniest of gaps.</p>
<p>Cocoon is packed full of high-quality sensors that it uses to detect these ripples which it converts into digital signals. Each action is different and creates it own digital signature, like a fingerprint, that Cocoon uses to build profiles and determine whether activity is normal.</p>
<p><a name=""FAQneighbour"" rel=""nofollow noopener""></a><b>If Cocoon is so sensitive, won't it pick up users' neighbours' movements, too?</b></p>
<p>Activity in adjacent buildings can cause ""background noise"" in the infrasound frequencies, but without a direct airflow between the properties, there are measurable differences in the sensor readings, which Cocoon can use to distinguish the two.</p>
<p>If there is a direct airflow, for example if there is a shared hallway or similar, then the area covered by Cocoon is typically smaller and the software within Cocoon can adjust the overall sensitivity during the learning phase. Air pressure changes over time and audible sound helps Cocoon to confirm if an unusual event is specific to your home or your neighbours having a party!</p>
<p><a name=""FAQprivacy"" rel=""nofollow noopener""></a><b>Cocoon listens to and watches homes all day - how does it protect their privacy and how will it safeguard householders' data?</b></p>
<p>We understand that security must be delivered without compromising the ultimately privacy of the home.</p>
<p>4 of the 5 Cocoon founding team come from the world's leading Internet Security companies such as Trend Micro and McAfee. Having developed cloud storage and internet security products since 2007 they are experienced at securing data on devices and in the cloud and we operate best practices in all of our data centre activity, build and user experience.</p>
<p>When you're home, Cocoon signals remote viewing by another user with a sound and pulsing LED.  Remote viewing can be easily disabled until you go out.</p>
<p>The 'normal' activity data that Cocoon collates never leaves your home. Video is encrypted at rest and in transmission (256bit AES) with decryption keys held only on your mobile devices.  The Cocoon cloud platform never sees decryption keys guaranteeing that data can never be leaked.<br/></p>
<p>Cocoon puts you at the centre of your home security so if an event occurs only you, the authorised user, will have access to the live video feed.</p>
<p><a name=""FAQiot"" rel=""nofollow noopener""></a><b>Will Cocoon integrate with other services like IFTT, Apple HomeKit or SmartThings?</b></p>
<p>We believe in the future of smart home devices working together to improve lives. In support of this vision we commit to always opening our APIs.</p>
<p>Cocoon is a smart, internet-connected device. As we make future releases we will be able to push out new functionality and add features to your Cocoon.</p>
<p>We have plans to integrate with the main home automation platforms in the same way that we support major mobile OS like Android and iOS at a time that there are clear market leaders.</p>
<p><a name=""FAQunderwhelm"" rel=""nofollow noopener""></a><b>Some crowdfunded smart home products underwhelm backers - what product quality assurances does Cocoon offer?</b></p>
<p>We are inspired by high-quality products (Apple, Bowers &amp; Wilkins), we refuse to settle on design or build and know that the longevity of our business depends upon delighting our earliest backers.</p>
<p>Many crowdfunded projects struggle due to the inexperience of the founding team. Cocoon's founding team are successful, seasoned start-up entrepreneurs. 4 of the founders are veterans of Humyo, a maker of storage technology which was distributed in Japan as a consumer hardware device.  </p>
<p>The team have researched and sought advice from others with domain knowledge to ensure any skill or knowledge gaps have been identified and filled.  We have engaged external advisers in the fields of electronic hardware production and hardware supply chain to ensure we continue to knowledgeable resources to consult with as we move towards delivery of our product.</p>
<p>Cocoon is designed manufactured and assembled in the UK. We are doing this to ensure that we can directly oversee that each unit is of the highest quality and to avoid communication and time delay issues that often beset start-ups that manufacture in Asia from the outset.</p>
<p>We believe in an ethical approach to business and as such we're ring-fencing the funds raised from crowd funding. We guarantee they will only be used to pay for components, tooling, production and delivery costs.</p>
<p>We will not use crowdfunding money to pay for R&amp;D, salaries, office space etc.</p>
<p>We offer a 12-month manufacturers guarantee on all of our products and 30-day money back guarantee if you're not happy when Cocoon arrives.</p>
<p><a name=""FAQalert"" rel=""nofollow noopener""></a><b>If something sets off an alert elsewhere in the house from the Cocoon how can the user know how to deal with the alert?</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>The live video stream includes high fidelity audio which a user can listen to for handling an alert out of Cocoon's line of sight.  Multiple Cocoons can work together if the user wishes to extend camera coverage.</p>
<p><a name=""FAQguest"" rel=""nofollow noopener""></a><b>What happens if I have guests - will Cocoon consider this an unusual event?</b></p>
<p>No, Cocoon knows you are home due to its geo-fencing capability. Since the house is active and normal daytime activities are being senses leading up to and during the guest visit, Cocoon will not activate its night time protection mode.</p>
<p>If someone tries to gain entry to your home in the middle of the night and you are in bed then Cocoon will not treat them as a guest and will inform you of an unusual event occurring in the home.</p>
<p>If a guest arrives (cleaner/etc) and you are away from the home then Cocoon will give you live video of the home straight to your smartphone via the app. You can then decide what you want to do - allow entry, trigger the siren, or indeed call the Police (probably not such a good idea if it is a genuine visitor!).</p>
<p><a name=""FAQphone"" rel=""nofollow noopener""></a><b>What happens if an alert triggers and I can't access my phone?</b></p>
<p>If you live with other people you live with can receive notifications from Cocoon if they have the mobile app installed. You can also set secondary contacts so that in the event that your smartphone is out of reception or if it runs out of battery and an unusual event is detected then a close friend, family member or neighbour will be informed. You should select someone that you trust.</p>
<p>We're also planning to offer an optional subscription that includes a monitored alert service at an additional monthly charge.</p>
<p>Again, you have the option to do this in the case of an emergency and don't have to.</p>
<p><a name=""FAQphonecut"" rel=""nofollow noopener""></a><b>What happens if my phone line is cut or my internet connection is lost?</b></p>
<p>If Cocoon is disconnected from the main or from the internet then the cloud system will alert the user. Cocoon maintains a heart-beat connection to the cloud system, if that connection is unexpectedly dropped the user is alerted that the internet or power has been cut.</p>
<p>Cocoon learns any normal pattern of drops your connection experiences do if your internet connection dips out occasionally for a couple of minutes the system will learn this and will not send you an alert until the behaviour is out of the ordinary.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that Cocoon records activity on the device locally and only pushes it to the cloud (and then your smartphone) when an unusual event is detected. This means that if the line is cut (highly unlikely) then you'll still have evidence of the crime occurring once the intruder attempts to enter the home.</p>
<p><a name=""FAQpstn"" rel=""nofollow noopener""></a><b>Does Cocoon need to use a telephone line?</b></p>
<p>Cocoon doesn't need to use the hard telephone (PSTN) line directly. The device connects to your home WiFi network which then connects to our cloud service and your smartphone(s). The system is secure, encrypting data during transmission and at rest.</p>
<p><a name=""FAQfitment"" rel=""nofollow noopener""></a><b>What power fitments will Cocoon support?</b></p>
<p>Cocoon will support US, UK and European power fitments.</p>
<p><a name=""FAQpowercut"" rel=""nofollow noopener""></a><b>What happens if an intruder cuts the power to the home before attempting to break in?</b></p>
<p>If Cocoon is disconnected from the main or from the internet then the cloud system will alert the user. Cocoon maintains a heart-beat connection to the cloud system, if that connection is unexpectedly dropped the user is alerted that the internet or power has been cut.</p>
<p>Cocoon stores some video and audio locally on the device so if an intruder did take out the home WiFi or phone hardline we'd still have evidence that could be used to aid any Police investigation.</p>
<p>In the future, when there are a lot of Cocoons in your neighbourhood, we'll be able to tell you whether it's only the power or phone line to your home that's down or a general problem in the area too!</p>

There's no need to set it when you come and go and it learns what's normal for your home.""Potentially solves the shortcomings of most camera/motion detection-based smart home security systems"" - TechCrunch""In the game of crazy cool hearing, but the way it does so feels more like wizardry"" - Fast Company ""Think of Cocoon as a guard god, one that can send you a push notification whenever something seems amiss."" - CNET""Cocoon wasn't just made to keep your home safe, but to complement it"" - Gadget Review

One Cocoon can protect a whole home. Our unique Subsound® Technology senses activity in other rooms and on other floors without the need for any additional sensors.


Cocoon tunes itself to your environment so you can trust it to know when to alert you.  With Cocoon, you can check in on your home at any time.

Whether you're at home, at the office, or lazing by the pool, Cocoon is with you. With intelligent notifications and HD video on your smartphone, Cocoon lets you see when something's wrong and control the response. Sound the siren, call the Police or a neighbour - you decide.

There's no need to set it as you come and go, Cocoon uses smartphone location to know who's at home. Cocoon has no sensor batteries to replace and you can take it with you when you move.

Cocoon gives you the peace of mind that your whole home is safe without lots of boxes and detectors, it's clever enough to know who should and shouldn't be there. Cocoon learns your schedule to activate protection whilst you sleep and with night-vision you can rest easy knowing that it was just a 'bump' in the night. 








We believe that home security should be simple and accessible to everyone. Cocoon packs all the security you need into one small package. 
Each Cocoon contains everything needed to keep your home and loved ones safe. No extra sensors. No installation. Putting people at the centre of home security.






Shortlisted for the 2014 London Design Award! Cocoon is great functionality and beautiful design coupled with effortless interaction. 


Designed to complement your personal space. Your Cocoon is made from high-quality materials and a great user experience starts the moment you first meet. 


Your home is an incredibly personal space. Designed not as an electronic accessory but to complement your home, we recognised not just the importance of form but also that it cannot be divorced from function.
The sphere is the simplest of forms, its surface constant and naturally perfect. Enveloping its contents in a protective way, the shape embodies the spirit of Cocoon and allows the camera to be positioned where you need it.




 

Cocoon's Subsound® technology profiles infrasound and audible sound waves to create a protective 'cocoon' inside your home. Subsound® allows Cocoon to detect activity well beyond the room you place it in, through walls and on other floors.

The study of low-frequency sounds (below 20Hz) outside the range of human hearing, or 'infrasonics' has long been used by seismologists for earthquake detection and geologists to study rock formations deep within the earth.
The same technology used to detect shock waves travelling through the planet can now be used to detect movement throughout your home.
With built-in machine learning, Cocoon understands what activity in your home is normal, so when an unusual event occurs you can be alerted and take action.

We've achieved the ability to protect a whole home from one beautifully crafted device that's intelligent enough to learn what's normal for your home.


We understand how incredibly important your personal space is. From a team with a strong security background, SSL and firewalls are just the basic layer of Cocoon's data security.






When you're at home, Cocoon indicates remote viewing by another user with sound and pulsing LED. Remote viewing can be easily disabled until you go out, so you're always in control.
Cocoon only pushes video to your smartphone if there is an unusual event detected or you request it, meaning everything stays locally (in your home) unless it absolutely needs to be uploaded.
Video and other data is encrypted both at rest and during transmission (256-bit AES) and decryption keys are only held on your registered mobile devices for added protection. Our cloud never sees your encryption keys, guaranteeing that your data can never be leaked.




We have working prototypes running in our alpha testers' homes including the Subsound® detection and learning software and a functional version of our mobile app.
We have identified and are working with our UK manufacturing partners. Cocoon's enclosure is designed and has been produced. Our electronics Bill of Materials (BOM) is complete and our first PCB design with production components is in testing.
We will soon begin work on

PCB validation and testing
Design for manufacture
Supply chain setup
User experience design
Completion of our software feature set including setup process

In short, we have prepared our technology, or core team is in place and we are ready to execute on our go-to-market plan.





Cocoon's founders believe in a vision of beautifully designed smart home products that put people at the centre of the experience. We believe technology should effortlessly and securely fit into people's lives. This people-centred approach is at the core of what we do. We are ready to take the Cocoon prototype through the manufacturing process into your homes.

We want to make homes safer with a simple yet powerful solution that is truly effective.
We've been working on Cocoon since the start of the year and now need your help to set up our manufacturing and tooling. We are dedicated to transforming home security and need your support to build a community not just a company.
Why support us

You don't use the security you have or don't have any useful security.
You love to know what's happening in your home when you're out and about or away for long periods.
You love great design and want to be the first to have an iconic home security device.

Your money will only be used to build your product - all funds pledged will be ring-fenced for tooling and component costs only.


We've developed our prototype that with your help and the team we've assembled should mean that we successfully deliver on our plans. We are at an early stage in our development and we may find that through our testing and refinement process that unanticipated problems occur.
We are manufacturing in our home country (United Kingdom) to reduce some of the risks. However bringing any new idea to market results in unforeseen issues which we will endeavor to minimise to ensure Cocoon is delivered according to our planned schedule.
Some of the issues which may be challenging are below:
FCC and CE testingThe device has to meet FCC and CE certification standards, but until the final prototype is built we will not be able to do the actual testing. This may mean we need to revise the electronics to pass the tests, which could cause delays.
SourcingWe have identified and are working with our manufacturing partners and component suppliers, but until we know from this Indiegogo project how large our first production run will be we can't get delivery commitments or finalise our negotiations with the manufacturers.
ManufacturingAlthough we have developed multiple software businesses in the past and have experience of hardware products, manufacturing isn't without risks. One key challenge is quality control. We have decided to produce the first production run locally to minimise the manufacturing risks, by being close to the manufacturing process we can ensure tight feedback loops and personal involvement in quality control.

How does Cocoon work?
Cocoon detects activity in the home using its built-in infrasound and other sensors (motion detection, audible sound analysis) and uses machine learning algorithms to separate activity that is normal for your home that you might like to know about. We call this technology Subsound®. Cocoon connects over the internet via our cloud service to your smartphones using geo-fencing to determine who's at home. This presence information is combined with learning your schedule to identify unusual events that occur - e.g. a front door being opened downstairs when the family are in bed or an unknown person moving through the property when you are away from the home. There's no need to create traditional 'zones' that you get in standard alarm systems or for the installation of other sensors.Cocoon sends notifications of unusual events to your smartphone from which you can access live and recorded audio and video from your home. If you have a large property and you want greater camera coverage then more than one Cocoon can work together to provide this.
How does Cocoon hear activities in a home?
If you picture your house as being underwater, you can see that a door opening or closing upstairs or a person moving around will make the water move in various ways around the house.  The same effect happens with the air in your house. An appropriate sensor can detect the air pressure changes or 'ripples' which correspond to activity in the home.
Cocoon is packed full of high quality sensors that it uses to detect these ripples caused by activity in the home and convert them into digital signals. Each action is different and creates its own digital signature, like a fingerprint, that Cocoon uses to build profiles for what is normal in your home.
If humans can't hear infrasound, how can Cocoon? 
Humans hear within the audible range of 20Hz - 20kHz but infrasound is classified as sound below that of human hearing (below 20Hz). Cocoon uses a powerful microphone to detect infrasound.
What is Subsound® and how is this different from infrasound?
Subsound® is the combination of sound wave detection (audible, and infrasound), digital profiling and machine learning. Subsound® lets Cocoon detect and make sense of the noise created by activity throughout your home so it can notify you if anything unusual happens so you can take action.
Infrasound is simply a frequency of sound wave so low (<20Hz) that we can't hear it. Infrasound can be created by many things in and around the home but on its own it has a very low chance of correctly indicating unusual activity.
Why is Subsound® better at home monitoring than other technologies?
Subsound® technology enables Cocoon to detect and profile activity throughout the home without the need for additional sensors. This means that you only need one small Cocoon device in order to keep the typical home or apartment secure, eliminating the need for expensive wired home security systems and you don't have to remember to arm or disarm it.
Subsound® gives the peace of mind that the whole home is actually safe whereas regular smart cameras can only protect what they can see and suffer from false positives (e.g. rapidly changing light levels in the room monitored or vehicles passing outside).
Will Cocoon work in areas with high infrasound presence, like homes next to wind turbines?
Yes, Cocoon is smart enough to learn what is normal for your home and only triggers when an unusual event occurs within the walls of your home.
The term ""Infrasound"" on its own refers to any low-frequency sound waves. Just as our ears and brain can tell the difference between the audible noise of door closing and a train rumbling past, the sensors and software in Cocoon can tell the difference between the infrasound profile of a moving door and a wind turbine.  
Can Cocoon recognise off-schedule or irregular events in a home?
Yes. Cocoon actually works by understanding what is normal in your home and then notifying you when unusual (irregular) activity occurs.
How does Cocoon know which sounds are “normal” and which constitute a security threat? Will Cocoon alert users to abnormal sounds that are not security threats, like accidentally dropping a bottle on the floor?
Cocoon continually analyzes the readings from its sensors. A notable audio event can be processed to extract an audio ""fingerprint"". Different kinds of sounds, for example, jangling keys, the click of a door or loud music from next door all have different fingerprints.
In this way, Cocoon can turn the raw stream of audio data into a more comprehensible stream of events, with associated data. These events can then be analysed to discover patterns, as Cocoon learns what is normal for your household. This analysis is then used to build a model of what events are expected, tailored to your specific household.
With this model, augmented by information from your mobile app about when you are home or away, Cocoon can decide if a sensor event is likely to be significant, and show it to you.
Over time Cocoon adapts to your home, learning new profiles and adapting to your routine. You can also indicate to Cocoon that a type of unusual event reported to you is OK.
How do users enable Cocoon's security features when they leave home?
Cocoon automatically detects when you are at home and when you have left using geo-fencing on your smartphone so there is no need to arm or disarm it. You can check in on your home any time using the Cocoon mobile app, streaming HD video and audio straight to your smartphone, trigger the built-in siren or contact the Police.  
Can Cocoon accommodate multiple-occupancy, multi-user households, in which occupants come and go at different times?
Yes. Just install the app on each authorised occupant's phone and Cocoon will know who is at home and behave accordingly.
How can only one Cocoon listen to and protect an entire house?
When any wave fits through a gap it will spread out a bit.  The greater the wavelength, the more it will spread out.  Because the 'ripples' or waves of air pressure changes Cocoon monitors are of very low frequency they spread out a lot allowing them to travel a long way around a building, even though the tiniest of gaps.
Cocoon is packed full of high-quality sensors that it uses to detect these ripples which it converts into digital signals. Each action is different and creates it own digital signature, like a fingerprint, that Cocoon uses to build profiles and determine whether activity is normal.
If Cocoon is so sensitive, won't it pick up users' neighbours' movements, too?
Activity in adjacent buildings can cause ""background noise"" in the infrasound frequencies, but without a direct airflow between the properties, there are measurable differences in the sensor readings, which Cocoon can use to distinguish the two.
If there is a direct airflow, for example if there is a shared hallway or similar, then the area covered by Cocoon is typically smaller and the software within Cocoon can adjust the overall sensitivity during the learning phase. Air pressure changes over time and audible sound helps Cocoon to confirm if an unusual event is specific to your home or your neighbours having a party!
Cocoon listens to and watches homes all day - how does it protect their privacy and how will it safeguard householders' data?
We understand that security must be delivered without compromising the ultimately privacy of the home.
4 of the 5 Cocoon founding team come from the world's leading Internet Security companies such as Trend Micro and McAfee. Having developed cloud storage and internet security products since 2007 they are experienced at securing data on devices and in the cloud and we operate best practices in all of our data centre activity, build and user experience.
When you're home, Cocoon signals remote viewing by another user with a sound and pulsing LED.  Remote viewing can be easily disabled until you go out.
The 'normal' activity data that Cocoon collates never leaves your home. Video is encrypted at rest and in transmission (256bit AES) with decryption keys held only on your mobile devices.  The Cocoon cloud platform never sees decryption keys guaranteeing that data can never be leaked.
Cocoon puts you at the centre of your home security so if an event occurs only you, the authorised user, will have access to the live video feed.
Will Cocoon integrate with other services like IFTT, Apple HomeKit or SmartThings?
We believe in the future of smart home devices working together to improve lives. In support of this vision we commit to always opening our APIs.
Cocoon is a smart, internet-connected device. As we make future releases we will be able to push out new functionality and add features to your Cocoon.
We have plans to integrate with the main home automation platforms in the same way that we support major mobile OS like Android and iOS at a time that there are clear market leaders.
Some crowdfunded smart home products underwhelm backers - what product quality assurances does Cocoon offer?
We are inspired by high-quality products (Apple, Bowers & Wilkins), we refuse to settle on design or build and know that the longevity of our business depends upon delighting our earliest backers.
Many crowdfunded projects struggle due to the inexperience of the founding team. Cocoon's founding team are successful, seasoned start-up entrepreneurs. 4 of the founders are veterans of Humyo, a maker of storage technology which was distributed in Japan as a consumer hardware device.  
The team have researched and sought advice from others with domain knowledge to ensure any skill or knowledge gaps have been identified and filled.  We have engaged external advisers in the fields of electronic hardware production and hardware supply chain to ensure we continue to knowledgeable resources to consult with as we move towards delivery of our product.
Cocoon is designed manufactured and assembled in the UK. We are doing this to ensure that we can directly oversee that each unit is of the highest quality and to avoid communication and time delay issues that often beset start-ups that manufacture in Asia from the outset.
We believe in an ethical approach to business and as such we're ring-fencing the funds raised from crowd funding. We guarantee they will only be used to pay for components, tooling, production and delivery costs.
We will not use crowdfunding money to pay for R&D, salaries, office space etc.
We offer a 12-month manufacturers guarantee on all of our products and 30-day money back guarantee if you're not happy when Cocoon arrives.
If something sets off an alert elsewhere in the house from the Cocoon how can the user know how to deal with the alert?

The live video stream includes high fidelity audio which a user can listen to for handling an alert out of Cocoon's line of sight.  Multiple Cocoons can work together if the user wishes to extend camera coverage.
What happens if I have guests - will Cocoon consider this an unusual event?
No, Cocoon knows you are home due to its geo-fencing capability. Since the house is active and normal daytime activities are being senses leading up to and during the guest visit, Cocoon will not activate its night time protection mode.
If someone tries to gain entry to your home in the middle of the night and you are in bed then Cocoon will not treat them as a guest and will inform you of an unusual event occurring in the home.
If a guest arrives (cleaner/etc) and you are away from the home then Cocoon will give you live video of the home straight to your smartphone via the app. You can then decide what you want to do - allow entry, trigger the siren, or indeed call the Police (probably not such a good idea if it is a genuine visitor!).
What happens if an alert triggers and I can't access my phone?
If you live with other people you live with can receive notifications from Cocoon if they have the mobile app installed. You can also set secondary contacts so that in the event that your smartphone is out of reception or if it runs out of battery and an unusual event is detected then a close friend, family member or neighbour will be informed. You should select someone that you trust.
We're also planning to offer an optional subscription that includes a monitored alert service at an additional monthly charge.
Again, you have the option to do this in the case of an emergency and don't have to.
What happens if my phone line is cut or my internet connection is lost?
If Cocoon is disconnected from the main or from the internet then the cloud system will alert the user. Cocoon maintains a heart-beat connection to the cloud system, if that connection is unexpectedly dropped the user is alerted that the internet or power has been cut.
Cocoon learns any normal pattern of drops your connection experiences do if your internet connection dips out occasionally for a couple of minutes the system will learn this and will not send you an alert until the behaviour is out of the ordinary.
Keep in mind that Cocoon records activity on the device locally and only pushes it to the cloud (and then your smartphone) when an unusual event is detected. This means that if the line is cut (highly unlikely) then you'll still have evidence of the crime occurring once the intruder attempts to enter the home.
Does Cocoon need to use a telephone line?
Cocoon doesn't need to use the hard telephone (PSTN) line directly. The device connects to your home WiFi network which then connects to our cloud service and your smartphone(s). The system is secure, encrypting data during transmission and at rest.
What power fitments will Cocoon support?
Cocoon will support US, UK and European power fitments.
What happens if an intruder cuts the power to the home before attempting to break in?
If Cocoon is disconnected from the main or from the internet then the cloud system will alert the user. Cocoon maintains a heart-beat connection to the cloud system, if that connection is unexpectedly dropped the user is alerted that the internet or power has been cut.
Cocoon stores some video and audio locally on the device so if an intruder did take out the home WiFi or phone hardline we'd still have evidence that could be used to aid any Police investigation.
In the future, when there are a lot of Cocoons in your neighbourhood, we'll be able to tell you whether it's only the power or phone line to your home that's down or a general problem in the area too!",43.0,0,"1 Campaign

Nothing is trusted. Trust is for you to decide whom to endow. Those components are:</p><p></p><p></p><ol>
<li>You - Undefined</li>
<li>Processor - Simple man in the middle. This is me. If you like this design, I ask you to trust me. I know nothing of your business and do not need to. Think of me as the mail man. I basically decode the card and relay the transaction to your PITA over Tor.</li>
<li>Issuer - This is the module that prints the cards. I will do this for you but I am not your only choice. You can even do this yourself if financial security outweighs the cost of the card printer. You can also be your own issuer with the purchase of a magnetic card encoder and any existing card including a gift card from your local favorite merchant.</li>
<li>Merchant - This is the hardware at the store that you swipe the card into.</li>
<li>Market Place - This is a secure and anonymous place to purchase cards, PITAS, and other services.</li>
<li>Provider - This is the PITA ISP. This is the secure environment I am creating for your wallet to be online all the time. This can be anyone, me, current ISPs, or even yourself. You know - if you are not eager to trust others. Funds are never pooled. Data is never pooled. If the system were hacked they would have to hack each PITA. They would never get everyone's coins.</li>
<li>PITAS - The easiest way to put this is it is your own private bank. Read more about it below!</li>
</ol><p></p><h3>You</h3><p>You are the card insofar as the system is concerned. The card has no limitations. Design it with as much or as little information as you care to. The back of the card will have a recommended standard for ease of use. Feel free to ignore it completely.</p><p></p><p>Here is an example what is encoded on the card:</p><p>TRACK 1: OOAK7MOP5QWKJEQFYA2YRV2FCA^JENSEN/JASON
A^8870264803297193</p><p>TRACK 2: 8870264803297193=12081400000000096013</p><p>8870264803297193 is the card number. JENSEN/JASON A is the card holder name - which is optional or can be fake. It is also my name.<br/></p><p>120814 is the date the card was issued. So far all this is standard stuff.<br/></p><p>OOAK7MOP5QWKJEQFYA2YRV2FCA is the magic. This is the security blanket and the innovation. Well that plus 096013. The big long string is an ECDH 521 bit encryped representation of a Tor Hidden Service. If you are not familiar you should look here: <a href=""https://www.torproject.org/docs/hidden-services.html.en"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""> Tor: Hidden Service Protocol</a> . Without the encryption Tor offers a very secure and anonymous network in which to communicate. But we take that Tor hidden service address and encrypt it to the Public Key of the Processor (that'd be me! I hope) The reason for this is simple. If you have an accessible machine, then people can try to take a crack at opening it. By encrypting it to me you ensure that only I will ever attempt to connect to it and by using Tor I will know nothing about it. 096013 is the initialization vector from a published common dataset. An Initialization Vector is just a way of preventing encoding 1 bit of data 2 times with 1 key from having the same ciphertext.<br/></p><p></p><h3>Processor</h3>The processor's job is pretty simple but really important. The processor is the only one that can know the Tor Hidden Service address. That means no one can attempt to attack or crack your PITA. But the Processor only has these pieces of information:<p></p><p></p><ol>
<li>The Initialization Vector Common Database - this will be published anyways</li>
<li>The Public Key to all the cards - this will be published anyways.</li>
<li>The Private Key to all the cards</li>
<li>A database of Tor to hand entered card numbers (this is completely optional but useful for hardware failures - you can change this at anytime without modifying the card!)</li>
<li>Market Data</li>
</ol><p>I do not even have a database of the secure tor addresses - remember that is stored on the card! Worst case scenario I loose the private key and all the cards need to be re-encoded (you just swipe the card with a $175 machine!). Nobody gets a dime..</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Issuer</h3><p>The issuer prints and mails the cards. This can be anyone who can afford a card printer that can print front and back. The issuer program will automatically take orders from the Market Place as well as have a hand enter batch system. The best way to think of this module is as a new type of miner. Unlike the network miners this miner will have real physical outputs. It will also require labor.</p><p></p><h4>Paper Folder Module </h4><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""326"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FlDsB_fRvcJE%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DlDsB_fRvcJE&amp;image=http%3A%2F%2Fi1.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FlDsB_fRvcJE%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube"" width=""580""></iframe></div><br/><p></p><p></p><h4>Card Printer </h4><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""326"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FpwhARPXwLWA%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DpwhARPXwLWA&amp;image=http%3A%2F%2Fi1.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FpwhARPXwLWA%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube"" width=""580""></iframe></div><br/><p></p><p><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 0.06em; line-height: 30px;"">Market Place</span><br/></p>A simple place to buy and sell services, securely and anonymously (well your address will be required to mail your card to you but my hope is card will be for sale at malls and stores around the world!). This will be part of the Processor module in implementation.<p></p><p></p><p></p><h3>Provider</h3><p>This is where the real magic happens. We turned a standard Linux box into a unmanaged black box system. You can not even set the IP address on the system it requires DHCP, there are no valid logins, and it does not accept inbound connections. It uses Tor for everything and enforces that all PITAS do as well. It requires that it builds all the partitions and checks every file's signature. It also creates the whole hypervisor environment and spins up as many PITAS as the hardware can support. It creates one internal network. It also spins up a few key Virtual Machines (VMs) that have specific functions. One is the Swarm Exit Node. It is a Tor Router Middle Box. All routing it does is over Tor. All other VMs are attached to the internal network only. Swarm Manage is responsible for managing all the VM instances. No one can access it either. The only configuration it has is your company name, your payment address, and your hourly rate for leasing the service. This is also a new type of miner. You provide a service, that requires computer resources, and in turn get paid for it. It, however, requires a different type of hardware then a traditional miner. There will also never be an equivalent of a ASIC. It also does not ""create"" coins.</p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/395314/files/20140225224312-Provider.jpg?1393396992"" src="""" style=""""/></p>The Provider uses a Copy On Write Filesystem (COW hehe) [BTRFS] to limit the amount of replication of the blockchain. Without getting too complicated, a COW file system can clone an entire hard drive in almost no time for use by another system. This way all the PITAS use the same hard drive space for the same blockchain. Each night the system reconciles all the PITAS back into a common clone. This is all done in the Swarm Data VM. To use real world numbers, I am hoping to put upwards of 250 PITAS on one system. If each one required the a copy of the blockchain that would require around 4.2TB with a blockchain size of 17GB. By using a COW file system this is reduced to just 17GB+(Number of PITAS * Daily Blockchain Growth). To provide America with this system, assuming 150 million ""households"", that would require about 2.5 Zettabytes. What is worse is this would be the exact same data. However, this system will still require hundreds of thousands of servers.<p></p><p></p><h3>PITAS</h3><p>The PITAS. It's the cutesy name I came up with. It stands for Personal Information Transaction Authorization System. It actually fits. It's clever too. But the acronym was reverse engineered to make you think of food. It's sole purpose is to protect your money- your coin- your savings.</p><p></p><p>But it is basically a virtual machine.</p><p>Bottom line is you configure it. It receives the transaction request, then follows the rules you setup to get authorization. This makes the card worthless without the ability to confirm the transaction. The PITAS can use text messages, phone calls, and two factor authentication schemes to approve a transaction. You will have complete control.</p>Here is a design diagram.<p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/395311/files/20140225223757-PITAS-Simple1.jpg?1393396677"" src="""" style=""""/></p>The file system is a clone of an image. On top of that during boot the system sets up an encrypted partition using a random key (/dev/urandom). Think of it as a single boot computer. You turn it on, set it up, when it reboots or looses power everything is gone. Don't worry though! All your data is stored encrypted on a decentralized store. Actually it is a lot like Blockchain.info but instead of using a browser I wanted to use a whole computer. But for practicality I used virtual machines. The fault with this is that VMs rely on the security of the hypervisor for security. That is why no one can login to the Provider.<p></p><p>On top of this it has Tor installed. This is how all communications take place. The PITAS will have firewall rules that do not let incoming connections and there are no logins. Finally the screen will most likely just display a big happy face.</p><p>The process of how this all takes place is a bit convoluted but, basically the system starts, uses DHCP to get an IP address, connects to the Swarm Manage VM once to get a Unique Identifier. This UID will represent the whole ISP not the computer it resides on. It then generates a Tor Hidden Service Address. It connects to the Processor and posts it's availability. Once you pay for it with coin, it will send you the Tor address, from there you initialize it, install your wallet, and enroll your cards. I am leaving some details out but nothing is rocket science. Basically the Provider will never know what system your PITAS is on but will still get paid for the service.</p><h3>Merchant </h3>For our prototype purposes we are choosing the bulk of the hardware from market standard equipment in predominately Asian markets. If this decision perplexes you, please look at your printer, fax, or just about any other Western world product. They are encumbered with End User Licensing Agreements and other legal restrictions - all of which are subject to change at any time. The products, specifically from China, have a very lax policy on use, pay cash get the goods, and you own the things you buy. Unlike say the FruitCompany [hint-hint] that sells the NotYourPhone (yPhone) that it is actually illegal for you to modify the software and run what you choose on the device. This same company just recently tried to deal bitcoin a blow by removing all the wallet software from the yNoise market.<p></p><p></p><h4>Simple POS Terminal (PERK)</h4><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/397005/files/20140226150853-8310174102.jpg?1393456133"" src="""" style=""""/></p>This simple POS terminal has an encrypted keypad, IC card, Mifare reader, Magnetic Stripe Reader, and a Thermal Printer.

A^8870264803297193TRACK 2: 8870264803297193=120814000000000960138870264803297193 is the card number. JENSEN/JASON A is the card holder name - which is optional or can be fake. It is also my name.120814 is the date the card was issued. So far all this is standard stuff.OOAK7MOP5QWKJEQFYA2YRV2FCA is the magic. This is the security blanket and the innovation. Well that plus 096013. The big long string is an ECDH 521 bit encryped representation of a Tor Hidden Service. If you are not familiar you should look here:  Tor: Hidden Service Protocol . Without the encryption Tor offers a very secure and anonymous network in which to communicate. But we take that Tor hidden service address and encrypt it to the Public Key of the Processor (that'd be me! I hope) The reason for this is simple. If you have an accessible machine, then people can try to take a crack at opening it. By encrypting it to me you ensure that only I will ever attempt to connect to it and by using Tor I will know nothing about it. 096013 is the initialization vector from a published common dataset. An Initialization Vector is just a way of preventing encoding 1 bit of data 2 times with 1 key from having the same ciphertext.ProcessorThe processor's job is pretty simple but really important. The processor is the only one that can know the Tor Hidden Service address. That means no one can attempt to attack or crack your PITA. But the Processor only has these pieces of information:
The Initialization Vector Common Database - this will be published anyways
The Public Key to all the cards - this will be published anyways.
The Private Key to all the cards
A database of Tor to hand entered card numbers (this is completely optional but useful for hardware failures - you can change this at anytime without modifying the card!)
Market Data
I do not even have a database of the secure tor addresses - remember that is stored on the card! Worst case scenario I loose the private key and all the cards need to be re-encoded (you just swipe the card with a $175 machine!). Nobody gets a dime..IssuerThe issuer prints and mails the cards. This can be anyone who can afford a card printer that can print front and back. The issuer program will automatically take orders from the Market Place as well as have a hand enter batch system. The best way to think of this module is as a new type of miner. Unlike the network miners this miner will have real physical outputs. It will also require labor.Paper Folder Module Card Printer Market PlaceA simple place to buy and sell services, securely and anonymously (well your address will be required to mail your card to you but my hope is card will be for sale at malls and stores around the world!). This will be part of the Processor module in implementation.ProviderThis is where the real magic happens. We turned a standard Linux box into a unmanaged black box system. You can not even set the IP address on the system it requires DHCP, there are no valid logins, and it does not accept inbound connections. It uses Tor for everything and enforces that all PITAS do as well. It requires that it builds all the partitions and checks every file's signature. It also creates the whole hypervisor environment and spins up as many PITAS as the hardware can support. It creates one internal network. It also spins up a few key Virtual Machines (VMs) that have specific functions. One is the Swarm Exit Node. It is a Tor Router Middle Box. All routing it does is over Tor. All other VMs are attached to the internal network only. Swarm Manage is responsible for managing all the VM instances. No one can access it either. The only configuration it has is your company name, your payment address, and your hourly rate for leasing the service. This is also a new type of miner. You provide a service, that requires computer resources, and in turn get paid for it. It, however, requires a different type of hardware then a traditional miner. There will also never be an equivalent of a ASIC. It also does not ""create"" coins.The Provider uses a Copy On Write Filesystem (COW hehe) [BTRFS] to limit the amount of replication of the blockchain. Without getting too complicated, a COW file system can clone an entire hard drive in almost no time for use by another system. This way all the PITAS use the same hard drive space for the same blockchain. Each night the system reconciles all the PITAS back into a common clone. This is all done in the Swarm Data VM. To use real world numbers, I am hoping to put upwards of 250 PITAS on one system. If each one required the a copy of the blockchain that would require around 4.2TB with a blockchain size of 17GB. By using a COW file system this is reduced to just 17GB+(Number of PITAS * Daily Blockchain Growth). To provide America with this system, assuming 150 million ""households"", that would require about 2.5 Zettabytes. What is worse is this would be the exact same data. However, this system will still require hundreds of thousands of servers.PITASThe PITAS. It's the cutesy name I came up with. It stands for Personal Information Transaction Authorization System. It actually fits. It's clever too. But the acronym was reverse engineered to make you think of food. It's sole purpose is to protect your money- your coin- your savings.But it is basically a virtual machine.Bottom line is you configure it. It receives the transaction request, then follows the rules you setup to get authorization. This makes the card worthless without the ability to confirm the transaction. The PITAS can use text messages, phone calls, and two factor authentication schemes to approve a transaction. You will have complete control.Here is a design diagram.The file system is a clone of an image. On top of that during boot the system sets up an encrypted partition using a random key (/dev/urandom). Think of it as a single boot computer. You turn it on, set it up, when it reboots or looses power everything is gone. Don't worry though! All your data is stored encrypted on a decentralized store. Actually it is a lot like Blockchain.info but instead of using a browser I wanted to use a whole computer. But for practicality I used virtual machines. The fault with this is that VMs rely on the security of the hypervisor for security. That is why no one can login to the Provider.On top of this it has Tor installed. This is how all communications take place. The PITAS will have firewall rules that do not let incoming connections and there are no logins. Finally the screen will most likely just display a big happy face.The process of how this all takes place is a bit convoluted but, basically the system starts, uses DHCP to get an IP address, connects to the Swarm Manage VM once to get a Unique Identifier. This UID will represent the whole ISP not the computer it resides on. It then generates a Tor Hidden Service Address. It connects to the Processor and posts it's availability. Once you pay for it with coin, it will send you the Tor address, from there you initialize it, install your wallet, and enroll your cards. I am leaving some details out but nothing is rocket science. Basically the Provider will never know what system your PITAS is on but will still get paid for the service.Merchant For our prototype purposes we are choosing the bulk of the hardware from market standard equipment in predominately Asian markets. If this decision perplexes you, please look at your printer, fax, or just about any other Western world product. They are encumbered with End User Licensing Agreements and other legal restrictions - all of which are subject to change at any time. The products, specifically from China, have a very lax policy on use, pay cash get the goods, and you own the things you buy. Unlike say the FruitCompany [hint-hint] that sells the NotYourPhone (yPhone) that it is actually illegal for you to modify the software and run what you choose on the device. This same company just recently tried to deal bitcoin a blow by removing all the wallet software from the yNoise market.Simple POS Terminal (PERK)This simple POS terminal has an encrypted keypad, IC card, Mifare reader, Magnetic Stripe Reader, and a Thermal Printer. For connection options it has WIFI, and 2/3G CDMA/GSM Modems. It also includes a battery which is standard.POS Terminal (PERK)This is a full computer. It can run Linux or Windows. As I am targeting the majority of users the prototype will most likely run Windows. It comes with a 15"" LCD touch screen, thermal printer, cash drawer, 2x20 Customer Display, Magnetic Card Reader (encrypted), and a barcode scanner.
Mobile Terminal (PERK)The Mobile Terminal is a 1ghz, 2200mah Android or Windows CE mobile workstation with WiFi, Bluetooth, IC, RFID, Magnetic Card Reader, and a Printer. Options include 2D barcode scanner, GSM/GPRS modem, Camera, and/or GPS. This system would be great for returants so you could swipe their card right at the table instead of making your customer wait, car dealerships, mobile businesses and trade shows, and, finally, it can be used to update inventory in your store.We are currently having quality control issues with this product. We still hope to offer it but as of right now we couldn't guarantee a product. Therefore, we are looking for a replacement but may not be able to find a comparable device. If you would have liked to buy this device you should contact Urovo and tell them to get their product organized. Email info@urovo.com.MyPITAS Appliance (PERK)This is a very special micro platform. It comes with a U640 Intel CPU capable of doing the virtualization instructions for Virtual Machines, 500GB hard drive or 64GB SSD, 4GB ram, 1 HDMI (if you want to re-task it), by default it will run the Provider OS. Again, your PITA would be on this box, where ever you put it since by using Tor it easily bypasses firewalls, and this is where you wallet could reside if you do not trust any ISP. It is also very inexpensive.",11.0,4,"2 Campaigns
