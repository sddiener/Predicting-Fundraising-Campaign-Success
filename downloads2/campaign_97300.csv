<h2>Executive Summary:</h2>
<p>There is a possibility for an exciting business/service that will work with colleges and universities across the United States. Boost Scooters, Incorporated will give students/faculty the option to rent a kick-scooter for personal short-distance transportation use.</p>
<p>For $0.15-0.25/min, it is possible for students, faculty members and staff to utilize a kick-scooter for daily use. Our scooter-sharing system has many positive advantages when compared with cars, and other modes of transportation on college campuses, which include: low operating and maintenance costs, low safety risk, and a decreased carbon footprint (environment friendly).</p>
<p>The target market for Boost will be colleges and universities across the country that are susceptible to on campus transportation. This includes 200+ campuses nationally. Within the university ecosystem, our target users are students, faculty and staff. In the future, our target market will expand to include select businesses/companies that have large campuses at which Boost can be useful. For both of these options, Boost scooters can be utilized to increase financially accessible campus transportation options and save travel time.</p>
<p>Many students do not have the disposable income that it takes to purchase personal transportation (kick/e-scooter, bike, etc.). Nor so they have the time or patience to carry it around/maintain it during the day. However, with the daily rental price of $0.15- $0.25, students are in a position to pay at least $30 throughout the semester for daily use of Boost scooters.</p>
<p>In year one, Boost Scooters would attempt to operate at least 10-15 scooters on multiple colleges and universities within the Philadelphia area. By year 2, Boost Scooters plans to transition our existing pilot programs into fully operational Boost campuses and expand to colleges and universities within the south and west regions of the country, targeting larger student populations.</p>

<li>Wellness: Boost scooters can also be depicted as a way to increase wellness for college students. By equipping a student with a kick-scooter, he/she is more likely to alleviate time-related stress, while also burning a couple of calories.</li>
<li>Campus Friendly: Boost kick-scooters are able to be used within the most popular walkways of any campus. Since they are not electric scooters, they pose a safer option to commute through campus minimizing the danger to bystanders.</li>
<li>Sustainable Commuting: Boost scooters gives students the option to step away from Ubers, and other motorized vehicles. This ultimately decreases the Carbon footprint of any campus.</li>

<h2>Our Product</h2>
<p>This new design of the kick scooter poses many benefits for the rider as well as the bystander. The larger wheels allow for a more stable ride in many different environments. The non-slip foot pad benefits the rider in rainy and snowy weather. The braking system controls the front and rear wheels, and allows for easy control of the scooter speed.</p>

<h2>How It Works</h2>
<p>The company will most likely begin operating at a school in the form of a “pilot program”. With this program, we plan to install a modest number of Boost scooters and racks (10-15 scooters and 15-25 smart-racks) in strategic locations across the campus of a select university or college. Throughout the pilot we will be measuring important factors for later analysis with the purpose of refining our business model and service operations.  There will always be more racks than scooters, so students/faculty members can have the option of unlocking and locking a scooter at different locations. An example is pictured below:</p>

<p>Payments will be made through the Movatic App. Through this app, students/faculty members will register through our private system and upload their payment information. Customers can also see the availability &amp; distance of each scooter within that campus area.</p>

<h2>Risks &amp; Challenges</h2>

<p>Of course, there are some risks and challenges that come with this process.</p>
<p>The first challenge will be receiving the approval of institutions to implement this service on their campuses. While this will vary from school to school, many colleges and universities are beginning to implement services that provide scooters and/or bikes to students and are quite comfortable with the idea. With the dangers in liability that come with electric scooters, many universities shy away from such and are instead fans of kick-scooters. Therefore, we believe that this is a very opportune time for Boost to enter the market. </p>
<p>Given that every school's financial budgeting will be very different, we must approach every negotiation with fresh eyes looking for the best deal for both sides. We a currently a growing team with room for advice. We are proud to be a part of an incubator with the Wharton School of Business and we believe that we have a substantial amount of resources and connections to help us through the process.</p>
<p>Lastly, we are prepared for the challenges that come with embarking on a startup. We are open to all advice, and we are dedicating a lot of time to respond to feedback and improve our company. By directly working with our manufacturer, we want to make it one of our primary focuses to be extremely responsive to problems, concerns, and feedback on the product and/or service. </p>

We use sensors inside the unit along with our special algorithms that allow Brake Free to detect all types of braking; normal braking (applying front brake and/or rear brake) and engine braking.<br/><br/><strong>Isn't this a huge safety issue?</strong><br/>The Brake Free unit attaches to the helmet using a universal clip mount. The clip mount uses a 3M VHB adhesive (much like GoPro mounts) to attach to the helmet. It is designed to break away from the helmet in case of an accident. It won't cause torsional damage to your head and neck. You are much safer with it than without it.</p><p><strong>How long does the battery last?</strong><br/>Short answer, 8-10 hours on average. Long answer, it depends on the type of riding you're doing and the mode you select.</p><p><strong>How long does it take to charge?</strong><br/>Brake Free takes 2 hours for a full charge.</p><p><strong>Can I charge it on the go?</strong><br/>Yes. If you have a power bank or any other power source that can charge a device using USB cable, you can charge Brake Free while you ride.</p><p><strong>Can I use it with multiple bikes?</strong><br/>Yes! Brake Free is completely wireless. It does not have any connection to your motorcycle. So use it on as many bikes as you want.</p><p><strong>How do I know it fits my helmet?</strong><br/>The Brake Free unit is designed to fit all helmet shapes with horizontal or vertical feature lines. If the unit does not fit on your helmet let us know and we will come up with a custom mount solution.</p><p><strong>What type of helmets will it fit on?</strong><br/>The Brake Free unit fits helmet sizes XS to XXL, matte or gloss finish, full face or half helmets. We have attached the prototype unit to road race helmets, street helmets, touring helmets, adventure helmets, modular helmets, and more.</p><p><strong>How Do I install it on my helmet?</strong><br/>Brake Free requires a clear spot of about 6 inches by 3 inches on the back of your helmet.<br/>First time installation:</p><ol>
<li>Take a second to plan where you'd like to mount brake free on the back of your helmet</li>
<li>Clean the selected spot with an alcohol swab for better mount adhesion</li>
<li>Attach the universal clip mount to Brake Free backplate (slips into female receptor slot on the back plate of Brake Free)</li>
<li>Peal off the adhesive backing on the back of the universal clip mount</li>
<li>Carefully align Brake Free to the selected spot (center it on the back of the helmet)</li>
<li>Press Brake Free against the selected spot on the helmet for at least 30 seconds</li>
<li>Done!</li>
</ol><p><strong>Will it fit if I have a Bluetooth module on my helmet?</strong><br/>Majority of Bluetooth headsets mount to the side of the helmet. Brake Free mounts to the back of the helmet. You should be able to add both products to your helmet without any issues.</p><p><strong>How do I switch it from one helmet to another?</strong><br/>The easiest way is to order an extra helmet mount(s) and install one on each of the helmets you plan to you with Brake Free. Brake Free is designed for easy removal and installation. You can do this with one hand (without taking your gloves off)!<br/><br/><strong>How can I tell how much battery charge is left?</strong><br/>When the unit powers on it will indicate the battery status. We are currently using the center LED panels to do that.<br/>3 blinks = full battery, 2 blinks = 2/3 battery, 1 blink = 1/3 battery.<br/><br/><strong>How can I tell it’s working?</strong><br/>When the unit powers up, it indicates the battery level. If the unit is in sleep mode, simply picking up the helmet will wake it up. You will see lights flashing as it wakes us. If picking it up or a quick shake did not wake it up, simply press the power button.</p><p><strong>Will it make noise on my helmet?</strong><br/>No. The shape was designed to work harmoniously with the natural air flow around a helmet. You won't even notice it's there.<br/><br/><strong>Can I ride with it in the rain?</strong><br/>We are aiming to get Brake Free IP64 certified, which means you can ride with it in the rain.</p><p><strong>Can I clean it?</strong><br/>Yes. Use a dry or slightly damp cloth to clean the unit. We recommend using microfiber towels to prevent scratching the surface.</p><p><strong>Is it legal?</strong><br/>In the United States there are no regulations preventing use of lights on helmets. Brake Free uses red LEDs that adhere to all DOT vehicle requirements.<br/><br/><strong>How bright is it?</strong><br/>It is the brightest helmet accessory on the market by far. It is brighter than most motorcycle brake lights.<br/><br/><strong>Can I swap batteries?</strong><br/>The Brake Free unit is sealed. At this time our design prevents user access to the battery.</p><p><strong>Will my friends think I look awesome?</strong><br/>Yes! Totally.</p><p><strong>Can I wear it while riding in a group?</strong><br/>Yes! As a matter of fact, it will improve your safety as a group. Riding in tight formation with other members' bike noise can make engine braking even harder to detect. The Brake Free unit will generally detect deceleration quicker than the naked eye and alert the riders behind, giving them an extra split second to react to you.</p><p><strong>How is it different from other helmet mounted lights?</strong><br/>We are the only truly wireless helmet accessory. Brake Free is completely autonomous. It uses sensors and our algorithm to detect braking. Other units require a transmitter to be spliced into the wiring harness, causing potential electrical problems in the future. We also use lights that are thinner and brighter than anything out there.<br/><br/><strong>What kind of light source does it use? E.g., LED? </strong><br/>We are using 4 custom shaped LED panels. There are 100 LEDs in total. These LEDs have a wide viewing angle of 120 degrees.<br/><br/><strong>What color is the light?</strong><br/>The lens is red and so are the LEDs that are being used. These lights are so bright that they typically over-saturate the sensor on most cameras, making them look orange.</p><p><br/><strong>How bright is the light relative to other brake lights, both OEM and auxiliary (both incandescent and LED)?</strong><br/>Brake Free is brighter than most OEM brake lights. There are motorcycles coming out now with really bright brake lights, but they are still out of the line of sight of car drivers. The helmet lends itself as the perfect place to add more visibility.<br/><br/><strong>If it uses an adhesive, does it damage the helmet (or leave a residue) when removed?</strong><br/>We are working with a 3M chemist to make sure we use an adhesive that will not damage your helmet when it is removed.<br/><br/><strong>Can I claim multiple perks?</strong><br/>Yes, if you'd like to claim multiple perks, please make a new contribution for each perk.<br/><br/><strong>Can I get a refund after the campaign has ended?</strong><br/>The money raised here on Indiegogo will go into product development, purchasing of materials, and manufacturing to deliver Brake Free to you. Refunds will only be issued if we can not deliver the final product after exploring all possible options. We will always be transparent and keep you updated on all developments.<br/><br/><strong>Will the product vary from the design above? </strong><br/>While we have the preliminary design and prototypes built, we may still make some minor improvements. We love hearing from our supporters and if you have any suggestions we will be more than happy to consider it.</p></div>","Sorry you've missed our campaign. Brake Free is ready and can be purchased now! Please check out our new website for all the details.Brake Free is an ultra bright smart LED brake light that instantly improves a motorcycle's visibility.It mounts on the back of the helmet you already own and with its constant LED light at a driver's eye level, you'll be more visible both day and night.Brake Free design, development, certification testing, and road testing is complete.Production of our first mass production run is underway. ""it makes you more visible to other motorists whether you're braking or not.""- Uncrate   ""California startup Brake Free wants to make your helmet useful in preventing the emergency in the first place, but mounting a highly visible automatic LED brake light on it, where car drivers are more likely to notice and respond.""- Dan Carney, MAXIM""The ultra bright smart LED brake light multiplies your visibility on the road, and the best thing? it has no wires, nothing to install on your bike, and works with no apps!""- Bless This Stuff""A bright red LED at their eye level that gets even brighter every time you slow down could make the difference between getting to your destination or winding up on in the hospital or worse.""- Bruce Brown, Digital Trends Click HERE to view our press kit  Brake Free utilizes accelerometer and gyroscope sensors to autonomously detect when you're slowing down no matter how: braking, engine braking, or downshifting. When it does detect you braking, its LEDs glow brighter letting drivers around you know instantly. And there is no wired installation or connected apps with your phone for it to work.  Just mount it, turn it on, and ride.  Brake Free is able to detect 3 types of braking and respond accordingly:

Regular Braking: engaging front or rear brakes

Engine Braking: decelerating without touching your brake levers

Emergency Braking: triggers special light pattern
This is what makes Brake Free special: it's not just a passive LED light that is constantly on (and in this case, it's on the continuous flash mode--more on that below).It responds to how you ride and alerts everyone around you when you're slowing down making you even more visible at this crucial point to prevent being rear ended.Above, you'll see Brake Free's CEO Alex Arkhangelskiy riding with the unit on, looking left and right, and bobbing his head in which the unit's LED lights did not glow brighter. Only until he pulls up to a stop, the LEDs then glow brightly syncing with his tail brake light wirelessly thanks to the accelerometer and gyroscope sensors onboard.We get asked a lot if the lights on Brake Free can be seen during the day time and the answer is a definite yes. The above is a raw clip from a GoPro mounted on the backpack of Brake Free's CEO Alex Arkhangelskiy slowing down during a day ride on the freeway.In fact, the lights are typically so bright that the camera's sensors are usually saturated from the 100 red LEDs.""After nearly 42 years of working in the motorcycle industry, and 17 specializing in helmets, one thing continues to prove true. A rider can NEVER be too visible. The Brake Free system is about as simple as it gets, yet offers a level of visibility unavailable prior to its introduction. It’s easy to install and will help riders to be seen when it counts the most. Brake Free is a simple, effective device that will dramatically improve the safety margin for all riders, regardless of skill level.""""Riding a motorcycle is like being invisible. To increase your odds of survival, it is crucial to increase your visibility. I use hi viz gear, headlight modulator and reflectors, and I will be adding Brake Free to ensure drivers see me.""""As the owner of a DIY motorcycle repair club I see so many bikes come in that have been clipped by cars that just did not see them or give them enough space for a turn. The novel idea of the Brake Free is a wonderful addition to increasing the visibility of all my riders - right at eye level for car drivers and without interfering with the riders reactions or responses. I'm recommending it to all the members!!""Attaching Brake Free Brake Free attaches to almost any helmet with our unique universal clip mount
Quick and effortless transfer between helmets
Dovetail design for secure installation
Mount attaches to the helmet with 3M VHB adhesive
No damage to helmet surface
 Mounts seen in the main pitch video are early prototypes and their look has changed from magnetic snap mounts to a mechanical clip mount.Turning Brake Free OnBrake Free is easy to turn on even with gloves thanks to its one-touch button. When it does turn on, it flashes to indicate its battery level:
3 flashes = 75-100% battery
2 flashes = 30-60% battery
1 flash = < 30% battery
 Continuous Flash ModeBrake Free also has a continuous flash mode which can be used as a hazard light. You can still wear it during this mode in which the light will function normally letting others know when you're slowing down by glowing brighter. Turning Brake Free OffAnd it's just as easy to turn off: Simple press and hold the one button for 3 seconds to turn off the unit. Charging Brake FreeWhen it is time to charge Brake Free, simply use the included micro-USB cord to fully charge it in 2 hours.Each BRAKE FREE unit comes with:
Micro USB charging cable
1 helmet clip mount
User manual
 We've gone through a series of prototypes prior to settling on the final Brake Free design. We got feedback from countless riders and industry insiders to help steer our design. We worked hard to keep the design slim, stylish and versatile. We've come a long way since our first proof of concept prototype. This prototype helped us validate our idea of being able to use sensors to detect deceleration. This was our test rig for tesing our algorithm with our sensor package collecting data from the helmet while riding. It involved lots of packaging tape, but it served its purpose. Don't try this at home.Conducting measurements of the final design's LED brightness. Our team has worked tirelessly for almost 3 years designing, developing, testing and iterating Brake Free. We connected with many industry professionals, motorcycle groups, influencers, and riders to make sure we are developing a product that is truly valuable and needed in our community.We invested countless hours and close to $100,000 of our own money to get Brake Free to the stage it is at now. We iterated our design 4 times and we now have working prototypes that look and function like the finished product.We cannot take this project any further without your help.  Alex ArkhangelskiyAvid rider and founder of Brake Free. After receiving his bachelor's degree in Business and Entrepreneurship, he set out on a mission to develop products that satisfy his two passions: product development and motorcycling.Ian DunnProfessional Industrial Designer with 10 years in the powersports industry as a motorcycle designer, working for major OEMs across Europe and the US. Ian's been riding almost 20 years.Johan BootAn experienced and skilled engineer specializing in electro-mechanical system design, mechanical engineering, robotics and sensors. He has developed our custom sensor fusion algorithm which is the brains behind our platform.Henry LiThe newest member of our team. Henry is a brilliant mechanical engineer with years of experience in designing cool products that have to work in very tough conditions. His experience in concept development, simulation, plastics design for both rapid prototyping and injection molding, testing, and proof of concept implementation is invaluable to our team and will undoubtedly help deliver Brake Free to all of our amazing backers. Did we mention he also loves to ride?!Dave HaddenAlthough his academic training was in Electronic Engineering, Dave is basically an inventor with a more natural affinity for mechanical engineering and a variety of manufacturing processes. In his 40+ entrepreneurial career he has 10 patents, 3 patents pending and over 100 products under his belt.We are committed to delivering on our promises and bringing you a great product, and we won't settle for anything less.We realize that some of you may have been burned in the past with a previous crowdfunding campaign that was highly successful that promised the ultimate motorcycle helmet...However, we are committed to rebuilding your trust and faith in motopreneurs with Brake Free.We realize that taking a product from the prototype stage through manufacturing will present many challenges. We have done our best to anticipate and account for many of them in our timeline and budget. And while there may be some unforeseen complications throughout our journey, we promise to let you, our backers, know first and be transparent. Click HERE to view our press kit How much does it weigh?Brake Free weighs 170 grams (6 ounces).For easy comparison, it weighs a little less than an iPhone 7+.How does it connect to my motorcycle?It doesn't. We use sensors inside the unit along with our special algorithms that allow Brake Free to detect all types of braking; normal braking (applying front brake and/or rear brake) and engine braking.Isn't this a huge safety issue?The Brake Free unit attaches to the helmet using a universal clip mount. The clip mount uses a 3M VHB adhesive (much like GoPro mounts) to attach to the helmet. It is designed to break away from the helmet in case of an accident. It won't cause torsional damage to your head and neck. You are much safer with it than without it.How long does the battery last?Short answer, 8-10 hours on average. Long answer, it depends on the type of riding you're doing and the mode you select.How long does it take to charge?Brake Free takes 2 hours for a full charge.Can I charge it on the go?Yes. If you have a power bank or any other power source that can charge a device using USB cable, you can charge Brake Free while you ride.Can I use it with multiple bikes?Yes! Brake Free is completely wireless. It does not have any connection to your motorcycle. So use it on as many bikes as you want.How do I know it fits my helmet?The Brake Free unit is designed to fit all helmet shapes with horizontal or vertical feature lines. If the unit does not fit on your helmet let us know and we will come up with a custom mount solution.What type of helmets will it fit on?The Brake Free unit fits helmet sizes XS to XXL, matte or gloss finish, full face or half helmets. We have attached the prototype unit to road race helmets, street helmets, touring helmets, adventure helmets, modular helmets, and more.How Do I install it on my helmet?Brake Free requires a clear spot of about 6 inches by 3 inches on the back of your helmet.First time installation:
Take a second to plan where you'd like to mount brake free on the back of your helmet
Clean the selected spot with an alcohol swab for better mount adhesion
Attach the universal clip mount to Brake Free backplate (slips into female receptor slot on the back plate of Brake Free)
Peal off the adhesive backing on the back of the universal clip mount
Carefully align Brake Free to the selected spot (center it on the back of the helmet)
Press Brake Free against the selected spot on the helmet for at least 30 seconds
Done!
Will it fit if I have a Bluetooth module on my helmet?Majority of Bluetooth headsets mount to the side of the helmet. Brake Free mounts to the back of the helmet. You should be able to add both products to your helmet without any issues.How do I switch it from one helmet to another?The easiest way is to order an extra helmet mount(s) and install one on each of the helmets you plan to you with Brake Free. Brake Free is designed for easy removal and installation. You can do this with one hand (without taking your gloves off)!How can I tell how much battery charge is left?When the unit powers on it will indicate the battery status. We are currently using the center LED panels to do that.3 blinks = full battery, 2 blinks = 2/3 battery, 1 blink = 1/3 battery.How can I tell it’s working?When the unit powers up, it indicates the battery level. If the unit is in sleep mode, simply picking up the helmet will wake it up. You will see lights flashing as it wakes us. If picking it up or a quick shake did not wake it up, simply press the power button.Will it make noise on my helmet?No. The shape was designed to work harmoniously with the natural air flow around a helmet. You won't even notice it's there.Can I ride with it in the rain?We are aiming to get Brake Free IP64 certified, which means you can ride with it in the rain.Can I clean it?Yes. Use a dry or slightly damp cloth to clean the unit. We recommend using microfiber towels to prevent scratching the surface.Is it legal?In the United States there are no regulations preventing use of lights on helmets. Brake Free uses red LEDs that adhere to all DOT vehicle requirements.How bright is it?It is the brightest helmet accessory on the market by far. It is brighter than most motorcycle brake lights.Can I swap batteries?The Brake Free unit is sealed. At this time our design prevents user access to the battery.Will my friends think I look awesome?Yes! Totally.Can I wear it while riding in a group?Yes! As a matter of fact, it will improve your safety as a group. Riding in tight formation with other members' bike noise can make engine braking even harder to detect. The Brake Free unit will generally detect deceleration quicker than the naked eye and alert the riders behind, giving them an extra split second to react to you.How is it different from other helmet mounted lights?We are the only truly wireless helmet accessory. Brake Free is completely autonomous. It uses sensors and our algorithm to detect braking. Other units require a transmitter to be spliced into the wiring harness, causing potential electrical problems in the future. We also use lights that are thinner and brighter than anything out there.What kind of light source does it use? E.g., LED? We are using 4 custom shaped LED panels. There are 100 LEDs in total. These LEDs have a wide viewing angle of 120 degrees.What color is the light?The lens is red and so are the LEDs that are being used. These lights are so bright that they typically over-saturate the sensor on most cameras, making them look orange.How bright is the light relative to other brake lights, both OEM and auxiliary (both incandescent and LED)?Brake Free is brighter than most OEM brake lights. There are motorcycles coming out now with really bright brake lights, but they are still out of the line of sight of car drivers. The helmet lends itself as the perfect place to add more visibility.If it uses an adhesive, does it damage the helmet (or leave a residue) when removed?We are working with a 3M chemist to make sure we use an adhesive that will not damage your helmet when it is removed.Can I claim multiple perks?Yes, if you'd like to claim multiple perks, please make a new contribution for each perk.Can I get a refund after the campaign has ended?The money raised here on Indiegogo will go into product development, purchasing of materials, and manufacturing to deliver Brake Free to you. Refunds will only be issued if we can not deliver the final product after exploring all possible options. We will always be transparent and keep you updated on all developments.Will the product vary from the design above? While we have the preliminary design and prototypes built, we may still make some minor improvements. We love hearing from our supporters and if you have any suggestions we will be more than happy to consider it.",77.0,1,"1 Campaign

<h1> The Trap &amp; Cartridge</h1>
<p>The Garbage Can Fly Trap allows users to discretely catch and eliminate flies from kitchens, homes and outdoor areas. Flies, already attracted to food waste in your garbage, walk into the trap (installed in the lid of your garbage can) and are caught in the disposable paper cartridge (under the garbage can lid). The disposable cartridge is lined with fly paper which prevents the fly's escape. The trap doesn’t require chemical attractants, the use of unsightly fly paper strips, or chasing flies with a swatter. The disposable cartridge can then be released directly into your garbage bag via a quick release button on top of the trap allowing for hands-free disposal. The Garbage Can Fly Trap captures fruit flies too!  Patent Pending</p>

<h1>How It Works</h1>
<p>Flies are naturally attracted to the smell of garbage in your garbage can. Flies, being attracted to the scent, seek the easiest route to gain access. We have designed the Garbage Can Fly Trap to let them think they have found it.  They enter on the exterior of the trap under the quick release button and follow their ""nose"" to the disposable cartridge below.  The cartridge contains fly paper which prevents their escape.  When you are ready to throw away the trap, simply push the quick release button to release the disposable cartridge directly in to the trash.  Then snap on a new cartridge and you are ready to go!</p>

<span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-size: 24px; line-height: 30px;""><b>The Basic Concept </b></span><br/>
</h4>
<div>
<b>Do you prefer to ""do it yourself""?</b> Many people do. What If I told you that you could build your own electric car? Other than a few mechanics, most would call me ""nuts"". Yet, I will say it again ""You do not need to be a mechanic to build a car"" and this is true. Every day our children are already doing so, though with vehicles of a smaller scale. The facts are simple. Most <a href=""http://rchobbytech.lightspeedwebstore.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">radio controlled</a> (RC) cars and trucks, powered by battery packs and electric motors, are more complex than the average EV. It is true. An EV utilizes no technologies which cannot be found in an RC. <b>The main issue is that nobody has yet taken the steps to put it all into one package. Our kits will do just this while also offering </b><b style=""font-weight: bold;"">""plug and play"" simplicity.</b> We will also include a step by step video, so if you get stuck, we are there with you. Companies like <a href=""http://www.speedwaymotors.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Speedway Motors</a> almost do it, by offering <a href=""http://www.speedwaymotors.com/Shop/T-Bucket-Kit-Car-Assembly/15.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Vintage Hot Rod Replica Kits</a>. However, being offered only with combustion engine options, the skills and knowledge of a mechanic, are once again a major factor. <b>Our EV kits will ""break the mold"" and empower you to <i>truly</i> do it yourself. Screw drivers, wrenches and a voltmeter are the only tools you will need. <br/><br/>Estimated retail pricing as low as $20K for entry level kits (complete) which can always be upgraded later, and race ready beginning as low as $40K. <br/></b><p></p>

<div>First you will be able to choose from our list of options. <b>A personalized kit will be packaged by us. It will include all of the parts needed to build a complete electric car.</b> Step by step written instructions, a real time build video, an optional tool kit and on call tech support, will ensure that you can do it yourself. And if not, or if you are just to busy for the <b>40 hour estimated build time</b>, you can create a new job. We can arrange a list of ""junior builders"" in your area, who are quailified and ready to build (or help). Below is a ""brief"" summary of options we plan to offer. It is written in depth for those who ""need"" to know, while the componants and key points are in bold type for those who like it simple. If we have left anything out which you wish to know, ask and we will answer. No secrets kept and any parts we build will not be patented.  </div>

</div></div>","We will not be carried by a flashy ad campaign. The animation and artistic images are for conceptual use only. However, we do have:
A Concept, a Prototype, a Plan and a Team. We are ready if you are. 


The Basic Concept 


Do you prefer to ""do it yourself""? Many people do. What If I told you that you could build your own electric car? Other than a few mechanics, most would call me ""nuts"". Yet, I will say it again ""You do not need to be a mechanic to build a car"" and this is true. Every day our children are already doing so, though with vehicles of a smaller scale. The facts are simple. Most radio controlled (RC) cars and trucks, powered by battery packs and electric motors, are more complex than the average EV. It is true. An EV utilizes no technologies which cannot be found in an RC. The main issue is that nobody has yet taken the steps to put it all into one package. Our kits will do just this while also offering ""plug and play"" simplicity. We will also include a step by step video, so if you get stuck, we are there with you. Companies like Speedway Motors almost do it, by offering Vintage Hot Rod Replica Kits. However, being offered only with combustion engine options, the skills and knowledge of a mechanic, are once again a major factor. Our EV kits will ""break the mold"" and empower you to truly do it yourself. Screw drivers, wrenches and a voltmeter are the only tools you will need. Estimated retail pricing as low as $20K for entry level kits (complete) which can always be upgraded later, and race ready beginning as low as $40K. 



Components of an EV Replica Kit: 

First you will be able to choose from our list of options. A personalized kit will be packaged by us. It will include all of the parts needed to build a complete electric car. Step by step written instructions, a real time build video, an optional tool kit and on call tech support, will ensure that you can do it yourself. And if not, or if you are just to busy for the 40 hour estimated build time, you can create a new job. We can arrange a list of ""junior builders"" in your area, who are quailified and ready to build (or help). Below is a ""brief"" summary of options we plan to offer. It is written in depth for those who ""need"" to know, while the componants and key points are in bold type for those who like it simple. If we have left anything out which you wish to know, ask and we will answer. No secrets kept and any parts we build will not be patented.  


The Shell (our first goal will make the molds)








Choose a fiber glass shell (to fit your budget) or go with our race ready carbon fiber shell. Each will be reinforced with kevler at the stress points with integrated framing and predrilled mounting plates. Exterior and interior trim options will be available (as well as trimless for the minimalist builders). Being that each shell will be made to order, custom alterations will also be available upon request. Windshields to be delivered pre-installed while window pre-installation is optional. Custom convertible options also available. Our ""mold master"" Antonio, with his professional fabrication skills and experience, will ensure the quality of our shells. His  most recent collaboration with Ford and Addictive Dessert Designs, was seen at the 2014 SEMA show. (Carbon Z600 shown below for reference only, not ours)    




Also, if the first generation is a success (Gen 1), a micro truck replica body will follow. The Gen 2 shell will be fully interchangable with Gen 1 kits, with a matching wheelbase and bolt pattern. An original design (our own and not a replica) will be introduced if and when a 3rd generation is reached. 



The Chassis 



The chassis' are to be built from gusseted steel tube framing for strength (shown without gussets, mid build). Easy to access, nuts and bolts will enable quick intsallation and removal. Choose from separated front and rear subframes, or the rolling chassis option which utilizes a one piece frame. Alterations will be avilable upon request. For Gen 2 we plan to release our lifted crawler frame. This frame will fit our Gen 2 body as well as the Gen 1 . 

Suspension 


Suspension options will allow you to select your desired ride height. Fixed or adjustable options will be available. Independant rear suspension and budget friendly leaf spring options will be available. 



The Motor            



Motors are to be offered in many sizes. Choose from AC or DC drive, ranging in power from 60-200HP 

Transmission options will include a 5 speed manual (w/clutch) or a 3 speed automatic (with optimized shift points to match your specific system and driving style).  

The Axles


To handle the extra torque which can be produced by an electric motor, all kits will include custom built axles (400HP rated from DriveShaftShop.com). However, don't be scared, as the motor's torque limit is adjustable for safety. If you want it ""unleashed"", it will be there waiting for you. RWD (rear wheel drive) and AWD (all wheel drive) models will be available. AWD kits will also include a custom driveshaft.







Steering will be offered in US Standard (left hand steering) as well as JDM or EURO style (right hand steering). 


The Speed Controller


Speed controller options will determine your overall performance limits. All speed controllers are adjustable (amp and ramp) so you can either feel the power or get the range (or anywhere between). Up to 200HP (1000A controllers only) or up to 200mile per charge with any controller when paired with our largest battery pack. The base model DC speed controller shown above. 

The Battery Pack   






Battery packs are to be offered in several sizes, which will determine your range between charges. All packs offered will utilize Lithium Iron Phosphate technology (LifePO4), chosen for safety, enviromental impact and performance. One of our single cells is pictured above, yet we do have options from several different manufacturers. As of now, our battery prices cannot be beat. 

The Main Power Cables




Cables and lugs will all be 4/0 guage. With reduced resistance comes more power and less heat. Available either pre-wired or you can cut and crimp your own. 


12V Wiring and Fuse box are to be prewired and color coded for an easy install (all fuses also included). DC/DC converter also included (provides 12V output from the high voltage battery pack) and a dedicated 12V battery is optional. 


The Battery Charger                   
Battery chargers are to be offered in both onboard and outboard models. Most onboard chargers will give a full charge in 3 hours or less, and are built into the car. While outboard chargers can reduce charge time to less than an hour, they are kept outside the car (like a gas pump). Many plug option are available, charge at home, at work or at a charging station.



Battery Management System (BMS) & Touchscreen Display






A BMS will be included with every kit. This is the computer which controls and monitors the charging and discharging of your battery pack to avoid damage and to ensure longevity. It also enables driver to monitor real time power consumption and fuel capacity. This enables you to adjust your driving style to attain an increased range per charge. The touchscreen display enables coded access for advanced programming of all parameters. 


LED lighting (headlights too) will be offered. Not only to keep up with technology but also to conserve power.   

Wheels and Tires will be offered in multiple styles with 3 sizes to choose from. 



Seats and interior While specifics are yet to be determined. We will include optional Woodgrain, Carbon Fiber or Aluminum inserts. Leather seats, dash and doorskins will also be available.

Available Upgrades will evolve and so will your car. All 2nd Generation parts will fit 1st generation kits. So you won't get stuck in the ""old"" as we move forward. 


Custom Decals 


Decals and wraps will be available to let your new fans know who's car it is, or  to endorse your business. Select from our graphics or create your own. Racing stripes, two-tone wraps and #s also available. All body wraps will be done with 3M Envision wrap products. The worlds first Non-PVC wraps. They are more versatile, durable and eco friendly than any alternatives available. 


Individual Parts will also be available for order. So if you only need our replica shell for your Suzuki Samarai frame, we got you covered. We will build it to bolt right on!


               



Comments and input are and always will be encouraged (questions too). Your ideas will help our product evolve. 

 
The Birth and Growth of a Concept: The story of an Obsession.... 

Inititially it was a personal mission. Several years ago while still waiting for the ""big guys"" to present a decent EV, I decided to take it into my own hands. With help, I was going to build my own. Yet if we were going to build it, I needed  Something worth keeping. I began searching. It was not long before I got a call from long time friend. ""I found your car"" he told me with confidence. Trusting his taste and judgement, I drove over to his shop right away (proved to be well worth the 200 miles round trip).
I could not have been more pleased. My friend Forest, had found ""the"" car. 
        I had never seen one before, but I was in love. A Japanese, 1972 Honda Niii 360. It was RHD and never released in the US. A perfect candidate for an electric transplant. Though I felt bad about gutting a rare vintage import, it had to be done. 

As we moved forward on the project, the world of blogs began to confirm that our dream was also shared by others. Within days after posting the project on a friend's website, ""the public"" found it and began to respond. From blog to blog, attention and comments began coming in all directions. Our project was turning heads, (though  mistaken for a 1969 because of it's rarity). Our project was referenced on websites such as Jalopnik, Ridelust, Auto Green Magazine and Clunkbucket. Ridelust's Dustin Driver, chose to run it again in his Top 10 favorites for 2010. From the articles (see links above), a few quotes really stood out. This inspired us to go further: 



""If the rear-wheel drive, electric Honda N360 isn't the anti-fail, we do not know what is"" - Sam Smith 


CLUNKBUCKET""Some folks actually go so far as to get the pieces. Far fewer fabricate the pieces into something that works"" - Mike Bumbeck 
 


   ""Not even the fantastic fever dreams of a madman could conjure this....truly an amazing piece of work....One of my all time favorites""  -Dustin Driver




   ""Back in October at the Tokyo Motor Show, Honda unveiled an electric vehicle concept....inspired by the tiny N360....While the EV-N may or may not provide a upcoming car....a little custome car shop in Santa Rosa, CA has been working on the real thing""  -



Just as the comments and discussions began, we watched Jalopnik's column climb past 10,000 views. With input, our inspirations grew. Your dreams soon became the goal. If for myself, why not for others? Yet with expectation, comes responsibility. After shifting our focus, the project soon went underground. While kept hidden from the public, it was not to be referenced again... Until now. After 4 years of silence, this is what we have done: 



Initial Process is Complete: Building a Prototype


We began with a whole car. A Japanese, RHD Honda Niii 360. Similar to the N600, which was available in the US, yet with a smaller engine. Originally, it weighed in at 1180lbs and was powered by a 34hp motorcycle engine. This is a brief summary.





We removed everything which would no longer be needed. (Cody handled the rear with a smile)





 Custom wheel wells were built from sheet steel (to fit the new wheels).




Wheel wells and structural reinforcement were installed in the rear.

We selected a prime location for the electric motor and race prepped tranny.  



With the front wheel wells installed, the custom strut towers were built.


Our custom front subframe (and no engine), would provide an ideal location and have enough support for main battery pack. 

The rear strut towers and motor mounts were then designed, built and installed. 



Then came the rear subframe... 




 ...with custom rear control arms and modified spindles. 



The motor, transmission and adjustable rear suspension were installed,




as well as adjustable front suspension. 




Everything was coming together as if meant to be. 

 

Once again the car was holding it's own weight. It was ""Re-framed"" and ready.



After the custom steering and brakes were complete, and some neccesary body work to repair some ""40 years of funk"". 





A new life approached...
Now that it could finally roll, steer and stop, we moved onto the final stages of the build. Day by day the ""to do"" list got shorter. From the electronics to the custom axles, it all came together perfectly. 

The prototype was complete and ready for road testing in August 2014.


Where are we now?


I have mine, and I love it. It can be plugged in anywhere, and can drive up to 150 miles per charge with it's current battery pack. When I do not need the range, I can turn up the power and tighten my belt. Green, clean, quiet and quick. 


Now let's make one for you. We are more than half way there. Though it has taken years to come to fruition, the prototype has finally hit the road. After several months of road testing we have decided take the next step. However, we cannot go any further on our own. We have the team and all of the resources to begin the replication process (other than the funding). With your help it will happen.


If Initial Goal of $50K is Reached:

We will be able to fund the casting process for the body. This will enable future production of the body shells, as well as at least one carbon fiber copy. This will be marketed alone (as just a shell) and will be cast to fit previously exsisting frames (Classic Mini and Susuki Samarai) with minimal alteration (we can do this by hand for now). Potentially being a way to fund the steps towards total reproduction (made to order). A solid first step.


Stretches:
$100K: The ability to reproduce, yet the sale of the first car produced would be necessary to cover the funding for the next step. Still progress.
$120K: Rather than selling the first one, we will begin a marketing and education tour ( schools, hobby and car shows). We will be ready for orders. The marketing team and advertising can wait (and will need to). 
Above $120K: It will take some penny pinching, yet we will be able to make it work.  Though we will have no room for paid ad campaigns or a fancy website, the kits will be available. We will just need to promote them by ourselve (and you). Still a wonderful thing.


Full-Stretch: if our ""full stretch"" goal of $150K goal is reached
1.  All perks will be produced and/or shipped. 


2. The body molds will be built. This will enable shells to be produced to order.
3. All current custom metal parts will be transferred to STL files (digital plans) to enable CNC reproduction (computer controlled cutting, bending and welding). This will greatly reduce production time and labor required, which will greatly reduce the final cost to the consumer. Other interior panels will be transferred as well, to enable production in wood, metal or composite materials.
4. At least one full carbon fiber electric kit car will be completed, titled and registered. It will be a ""performance model"" ready for the marketing tour. 
5. We will aquire a marketing and media team. A catalogue and website will be created. 

6. We will be ready and able to produce our first kits upon demand. One order at a time, yet production none the less. Demand will determine and/or fund further expansion of our production abilities. The sky is the limit.


*7. Offered to prior contributors only. Limited pre-orders will begin within 14 days after our 150K goal is surpassed (to ensure production). Pre-orders will be taken on a first come first serve basis. Summer 2015 delivery to be available for the first 3 orders (those placed befor April).  Estimated kit prices are as follows: 


Base Model Kits: beginning as low as $20K, 

Performance Model Kits: beginning at $30K

Track Ready Kits: beginning a $40K (wheely bars included, no joke!). 
Partial Funding: if our goal is not reached

$1 or more: No matter what we will honor the promised perks. Even if out of pocket. 
Less than $50,000: We will need to move on to aquiring investors to reach our projected budget. Not ideal, yet still a step closer to beginning the replication process. Enough for us to push on, and continue trying. Support without funding: The Power of WordsThank you for reading, that itself is a large contribution. Your attention is priceless. For those who wish to show support in a way other than funding. It is as simple as talking. If you like it, tell people about it. Share the link. The power is the word. 
Until then, we will continue ""dreaming""...",40.0,0,"1 Campaign

When you are counting on your hazard flasher you may be left abandoned sometimes. Depending on the impact, this device simply will no longer work as the blinkers are destroyed mechanically in most cases. Moreover, <strong>more than 70% of crashed vehicles</strong> come to a standstill crosswise to the direction of traffic so even a working hazard flasher will almost not be visible to other vehicles.</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://media.giphy.com/media/xUA7aKP02GSpQqqKfm/giphy.gif"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>In addition, experience has shown that especially on motorways breakdown triangles are run over by other road users in no time and as they are set up on the ground they are poorly visible only. Terrible accident reports of the last few years show that serious sequential accidents happen time and again costing the lives of innocent bystanders who had not been hurt in the accident in the first place. This is because following road users did not recognise clearly an accident scene.</p><h3><strong>Especially on motorways minutes may decide between life and death.</strong></h3><p> </p><div style=""text-align: center;""><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://player.vimeo.com/video/222118681?portrait=0""></iframe></div></div><div style=""text-align: center;""> </div><p>Our objective was to invent a novel, easy-to-use warning light for everybody incorporating state-of-the-art technology. “Warning light 4.0” so to speak. In fact,<strong> IWARN®</strong> is not only the world’s strongest and most advanced mobile warning light but a complete rescue system, as well for we integrated also state-of-the-art GPS and GSM. Owing to the use of 21 heavy-duty LEDs together with special ancillary lenses<strong> IWARN®</strong> is visible for kilometres. Depending on the situation, the user can choose among different flashes (emergency signal for mountainous regions, SOS, flashing, etc.) and continuous light. Moreover, its unique cruciform structure (similar to a railroad crossing sign) allows creating directional arrows (flashing to the left/right) in order to reroute traffic this way. </p><div style=""text-align: center;""><p style=""text-align: left;"">Apart from reliable optical warning for the prevention of sequential accidents it is essential to get help as fast as possible.

At one push of a button the operator will release a complete chain of rescue measures.</p></div><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://media.giphy.com/media/xUPGcCCq9yEOQ7hijS/giphy.gif"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>Every <strong>IWARN®</strong> has a built-in highly sensitive GPS receiver with a positional accuracy of approx. 1.5 meters. This GPS module is complemented by an extra strong GSM module which is appropriate for all national and international networks and which registers always in the network having the best reception at the moment. So, the risk to be in an area with no reception and to be unable to make a call is almost excluded for persons seeking help. The user can choose from 2 different emergency calls:  </p><p><u><strong>Emergency call for roadside assistance:</strong></u> such a call is made to report a breakdown (no accident, no injured persons) to the <strong>IWARN®</strong> alarm centre, e.g. when a car is standing on a breakdown lane on a motorway. This call will be forwarded to the headquarters of motorway operators for their information, for example. </p><p><u><strong>Emergency call after an accident:</strong></u> this call allows signalling an accident. The<strong> IWARN®</strong> alarm centre forwards the call to the responsible rescue organisation and will send help immediately. <strong>IWARN®</strong> will establish connections automatically to avoid that persons involved in an accident may not remember the right number in their state of shock.</p><div style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://media.giphy.com/media/l0Iy0RAQTtmlLlQas/giphy.gif"" src="""" style=""""/></div><div style=""text-align: center;""> </div><div style=""text-align: center;""> </div><div style=""text-align: center;""> </div><p style=""text-align: center;""><strong><i><u><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1497804052/fktbma7xyluzktvl4fwc.png"" src="""" style=""""/></u></i></strong></p><p><i>""Cars keep getting safer and safer. And yet, accidents occur. </i></p><p><i>Even if an accident is a close shave sometimes, you may soon be exposed to a potential life-threatening situation immediately afterwards on account of possible sequential accidents especially on dual carriageways and motorways.

When you are counting on your hazard flasher you may be left abandoned sometimes. Depending on the impact, this device simply will no longer work as the blinkers are destroyed mechanically in most cases. Moreover, more than 70% of crashed vehicles come to a standstill crosswise to the direction of traffic so even a working hazard flasher will almost not be visible to other vehicles.In addition, experience has shown that especially on motorways breakdown triangles are run over by other road users in no time and as they are set up on the ground they are poorly visible only. Terrible accident reports of the last few years show that serious sequential accidents happen time and again costing the lives of innocent bystanders who had not been hurt in the accident in the first place. This is because following road users did not recognise clearly an accident scene.Especially on motorways minutes may decide between life and death.  Our objective was to invent a novel, easy-to-use warning light for everybody incorporating state-of-the-art technology. “Warning light 4.0” so to speak. In fact, IWARN® is not only the world’s strongest and most advanced mobile warning light but a complete rescue system, as well for we integrated also state-of-the-art GPS and GSM. Owing to the use of 21 heavy-duty LEDs together with special ancillary lenses IWARN® is visible for kilometres. Depending on the situation, the user can choose among different flashes (emergency signal for mountainous regions, SOS, flashing, etc.) and continuous light. Moreover, its unique cruciform structure (similar to a railroad crossing sign) allows creating directional arrows (flashing to the left/right) in order to reroute traffic this way. Apart from reliable optical warning for the prevention of sequential accidents it is essential to get help as fast as possible. Shocked victims of an accident frequently are not able to give an exact description to rescuers where to find them. In such cases, IWARN® is a reliable tool. At one push of a button the operator will release a complete chain of rescue measures.Every IWARN® has a built-in highly sensitive GPS receiver with a positional accuracy of approx. 1.5 meters. This GPS module is complemented by an extra strong GSM module which is appropriate for all national and international networks and which registers always in the network having the best reception at the moment. So, the risk to be in an area with no reception and to be unable to make a call is almost excluded for persons seeking help. The user can choose from 2 different emergency calls:  Emergency call for roadside assistance: such a call is made to report a breakdown (no accident, no injured persons) to the IWARN® alarm centre, e.g. when a car is standing on a breakdown lane on a motorway. This call will be forwarded to the headquarters of motorway operators for their information, for example. Emergency call after an accident: this call allows signalling an accident. The IWARN® alarm centre forwards the call to the responsible rescue organisation and will send help immediately. IWARN® will establish connections automatically to avoid that persons involved in an accident may not remember the right number in their state of shock.   ""Cars keep getting safer and safer. And yet, accidents occur. Even if an accident is a close shave sometimes, you may soon be exposed to a potential life-threatening situation immediately afterwards on account of possible sequential accidents especially on dual carriageways and motorways. In this dangerously narrow time window it is vital that the accident situation is well recognizable and can be spotted fast.  For many years, I have been volunteering as ambulance man and time and again I noticed that a more than 50-year old safety system, viz. a breakdown triangle, meets these requirements only poorly and that this system is no longer up to date. So, it was my objective to invent a modern and novel rescue instrument and to set new standards by creating state-of-the-art technology. Today, after thousands of hours of work and designing more than 40 prototypes this goal has been accomplished. IWARN® is the most advanced warning light in the world and was developed to protect not only you and your loved ones but also following road users in the critical seconds and minutes after an accident and to ensure fast aid.""  Thomas K. Stelzl, IWARN® Inventor         To enable various applications, IWARN® comes with an integrated adapter ball allowing quick and safe connection to different holder systems for use at work or during your leisure time. The ultramodern magnetic base for the installation of IWARN® on the car top is standard equipment. It allows mounting it safely even in wet conditions or when it is snowing. It can withstand speeds of more than 150 km/h and comes with a scratch-preventing surface for the protection of your car paint.Place your IWARN® on the car top using the magnetic base and align it. If the vehicle is badly damaged, you can mount IWARN® on the vehicle also in any other position provided that it faces the oncoming traffic. IWARN® even clings in wet conditions and with snow and does not  scratch the car paint.   Owing to its state-of-the-art integrated computer control, operation requires only a minimum of 3 buttons: ON/OFF BUTTON – to turn on and off the entire system / when turning it on, “Flash Mode” (maximum luminance) will be activated automatically for protection FUNCTION BUTTON – to control the various blinking signals CALL BUTTON – to make emergency calls using the installed GSM module .  

 
 
Choose from 7 different light modes and 2 different luminous power settings (City Mode and Overland Mode).Flashing Pattern:  ""DOUBLE FLASH"" / DAY / 60 % ""CITY MODE"" ( with strong sunlight / movie recording with sun-filter ): Flashing Pattern: ""DOUBLE FLASH"" /  NIGHT / 60 % ""CITY-MODE"" ( movie recording with special-filter - the luminance is to high for the camera optics ):  Flashing Pattern: ""FLASHING ARROW TO THE LEFT"" /  DAY / 60 % ""CITY MODE"" ( with strong sunlight / movie recording with sun-filter ): Flashing Pattern: ""FAST FLASHING"" / DAY / 60 % ""CITY MODE"" ( with strong sunlight / movie recording with sun-filter ):  Flashing Pattern: ""CONTINUOUS LIGHT"" / DAY / 60 % ""CITY MODE"" ( with strong sunlight / movie recording with sun-filter ): Flashing Pattern:  ""NIGHT - MIXED"" / 60 % ""CITY-MODE"" ( movie recording with special-filter - the luminance is to high for the camera optics ): Flashing Pattern: "" HEDGING A GASOLINE TRANSPORTER ON A GAS STATION""    Due to the use of altogether 21 individual state-of-the-art LED bulbs each with a high-precision lens, light distribution at close range and from a dis-tance is ultrabright, homogenous and straight to the point. To avoid dazz-ling of road users in cities it is possible to switch over to “city mode” providing for a reduction of luminance to 60%. The installed GSM mobile telephone system with antenna booster ensures that the position and the emergency call can be transmitted instantly and independently of other mobile phones. IWARN® uses a stand-alone GSM module which has its own antenna booster and works with all GSM networks (GSM 850 / 900 / in 1800 / 1900 MHz and WCDMA 850 / 900 / 1900 / 2100 MHz) used worldwide. It is suitable for 3G and 4G (LTE) and will also work automatically in the future in a 5G network.  After pressing the ON/OFF button, IWARN® will search automatically and within a few seconds the GSM network having the best reception at the moment – no matter whether you are on a highway, in a town, on the sea or in a desert.A particularly robust SIM chip of the Austrian market leader ""A1"" is incorporated in every IWARN®. ""A1"" is part of TELEKOM AUSTRIA. TELEKOM AUSTRIA was founded in 1887 and has to date more than 25 million customers. The specialised department “A1 Digital” focussing on IoT, the “Internet of Things”, ensures that IWARN® can always rely on state-of-the-art communication technology enabling ultrafast onward transfer of your IWARN® emergency call. For example, an alarm from the United States to Austria needs less than 1 second. More information:  https://www.telekomaustria.com The installed stand-alone GPS determines the respective position with an accuracy of +/- 1.5 meters. Despite this exactness recognition takes only about 30 seconds. This system works with all 4 satellite networks: GPS (USA), Galileo (EUROPA), GLONASS (Russia) and BeiDou (China). Moreover, IWARN® is also equipped with the GPS variant “A-GPS”. This ""assisted GPS"" links with the mobile phone network and determines automatically the position via the mobile phone mast used by the GSM in case it is not possible to connect to one of the satellite networks in the sky. We cooperate worldwide with commercial operators of emergency call centres of the police, ambulance services or leading automobile associations which are headquartered in the respective region. This ensures also that there are no language barriers and that the best rescue resources are used.The IWARN® emergency call centre is on duty 24/7, 365 days a year and is in direct contact permanently with the control centres of ambulance services, police, fire brigade, mountain rescue services, automobile associations, railway companies and motorway operators. The nearest rescue forces will be called to send you help. Now, the emergency call centre sends an acknowledgement signal to your IWARN®. Your IWARN® will put out a light signal to confirm the receipt of this message. So, you can be sure that your call was successful and that help is on its way.  From the very beginning, IWARN® has been designed for a maximum of mobile applications. Every time you are parking your car to go hiking, for example, or climbing in the mountains, mountainbiking, paragliding or making a ski tour, do not forget to bring your IWARN®. If you find yourself in an emergency situation, IWARN® will be your reliable lifesaver also off-road.  Owing to its extremely strong light IWARN® is recognised even from wide distances. This is ensured not only by the built-in emergency signal for mountainous regions but also by the two rechargeable heavy-duty batteries which ensure that IWARN® will be flashing in permanent operation for up to 3 days. When switching over IWARN® to continuous light you can use IWARN® as a very far reaching flashlight. Irrespective of the light signals, the built-in autonomous GSM transmitter and receiver as well as the integrated highly sensitive GPS system ensure that you can make a fully-automatic emergency call by indicating your exact position. So, the rescue helicopter will get your exact coordinates and when approaching the scene they will recognise your light signals from the air already for kilometers.IWARN® comes with a special lifting lug that allows attaching it to your clothes or backpack using a carabine. Owing to its high quality in compliance with military standard MIL-STD-G850 it is vibration-resistant and insensitive to shocks and air pressure differences. Not to mention that IWARN® according to IP67 is water-proof and dust-tight.  As a standard feature, IWARN® allows pointing arrows to the left or to the right. When turning IWARN® by 90 degrees they are pointing up or down. With this signal, it is possible to show rescue helicopter pilots already from a great distance whether or not it is possible to land (arrow up: “DO NOT LAND – DANGER!” / arrow down: “LANDING POSSIBLE!”). Every time you are parking your car to watersports to exercise,  do not forget  to bring your IWARN®.   If you find yourself in an emergency situation, IWARN® will be your reliable lifesaver on rivers, lakes and seas . ​The coast guard will get your exact coordinates and when approaching the scene they will recognise your light signals already for kilometres. ​ If your car has been stolen with IWARN® inside you can activate IWARN® via the installed GSM module by a simple call. You will receive then regular text messages from your activated IWARN® indicating the respective GPS positions. This will allow you to track your vehicle and to inform the police about the current position.   You have full access to the IWARN® - emergency call system in the following 84 countries:ALBANIA .

Generation PROTOTYPE 2nd. GENERATION    An accident is not child’s play. When you are in an emergency situation there is no room for errors. From the very beginning it was clear to us that IWARN® has to meet very special requirements. In order to cope with them reliably, we teamed up with various leading Styrian companies and pooled their know-how and production capacities in the form of a micro-cluster based in the West-Styrian town of Deutschlandsberg. All production-related processes are taken care of by ""SVI"". This is where the complete assembling of IWARN® is done and this is also from where IWARN® is exported worldwide. Short distances between the individual partners guarantee maximum flexibility and control. For example, the entire casing is produced by the Stainz-based company ""Hiebler Kunststoffe"" which is just 14 kilometres away from Deutschlandsberg. WELCOME TO THE PRODUCTION-LINE OF IWARN®: With an R&D share of more than 4%, Styria – the “green heart of Austria” – ranks among Europe’s leading regions. Styria and its capital city of Graz are innovation centres in the Alps-Adriatic region. Five universities with more than 40,000 students, an internationally renowned system of universities of applied sciences and a great number of research centres make Styria the technology lab of Austria.STYRIA - THIS IS THE DNA OF IWARN®:         We're a serious austrian start-up with a growing full-time team and a production ready working prototype.We've finalized designs and teamed up with various leading Styrian companies and pooled their know-how and production capacities in the form of a micro-cluster. It's safe to say that we've reduced many of the risks typical of a hardware start-up. We will be working with austrian manufacturers who have years of experience delivering excellent products in tremendous quantities.However, as with any newly manufactured product, it's possible for unexpected events (component delays and unexpected shortage) to impact the actual production time frame.Our commitment to all of you, dear IWARN® customers, is that we will make every effort to deliver you an amazing product on time to safe you and your family.Thank you for your trust!",68.0,16,"1 Campaign

<br/><div>Conceived as a true piece of design, <b>Bike Safe by Vadolibero</b> is a first in the market. It solves three issues at once: it's the <b>first wall mount lock that holds any kind of bicycle perfectly straight on the wall</b>. At home, in the office, in the garage or... outdoors! It’s beautiful, with its sleek lines it fits any style of apartment or ambience. It’s resistant: engineered to offer a secure locking system, either the thief uses a sledge hammer to remove it from your wall or an electric saw to cut the reinforced stainless steel layers and junctions. And they both are quite noisy activities... <b>Bike Safe </b><b>by Vadolibero</b> is the most advanced bike wall mount available on the market.<b><br/><br/></b>

<b>TALKING ABOUT YOUR EXPENSIVE WHEELS...</b><br/> Bike Safe is the only wall 
mount that aims to beat bike crime in the home, securing the bicycle 
most precious part: the  frame. And that's an absolute first in the 
market! In these first days of the Indiegogo campaign, some people 
pointed out that the expensive wheels could still be stolen... Well, 
here is an easy (and still stylish) solution: use common braided steel 
double loop cables. And if you own an expensive seat post, you can use 
the cable to block that, too!<br/><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1469206417/Whell_Lock_nrzy4k.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<br/>* base width: 17 cm
<br/>* min/max depth: 40,6 - 50 cm
<br/>* weight: 4 kg
<br/><br/><h3>The materials</h3>- <b>Stainless steel 304</b>: widely used for its exceptional forming 
and welding characteristics, it has a higher corrosion resistance than 
regular steel to a wide range of atmospheric environments and many 
corrosive media. For Bike Safe we chose a sophisticated satin finish.<br/>- <b>Technogel™️</b>: a unique “soft solid” material, that joins 
together the 3D deformation of a fluid and the memory shape of a solid. 
It’s a completely non-toxic and stable polyurethane substance (made 
without using oils or plasticizers), used in a wide range of 
applications.<br/><br/>
</div>
<h3>* Mounting &amp; security</h3>Last but not least, <b>Bike Safe is very easy to mount on the wall</b>: we provide <b>4 security anchors</b> (size M6x60mm, together with special allen key and bit) and the targeting mask, you will only need to use your drill. As far as <b>the anchorage</b> is concerned, we've tested Bike Safe on <b>brick walls, reinforced concrete and drywalls</b>:
 it works with them all. In the box, you'll find the anchors suitable 
for the first two, while if you want to hang it on a drywall, you'll 
need to get the ones that fit best its thickness.<br/><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1469030191/IMG_2595.2_gq7in9.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<h3>Risks and challenges<br/>
</h3>
<p>We've been working for 3 years marketing the products of the Ride Home collection by Vadolibero, learning how to move a prototype to a ready to use product for the market. The Bike Safe has been prototyped and tested by retailers and friends. Your investment will go towards production and shipping. We'll be making the Bike Safe in manufacturing facilities in Brianza, the design district in Northern Italy. We are ready with the whole process. We only need now to reach sufficient quantities to offer the best price with the maximum quality.  However, if we had to pick a risk factor in making this product, it would be dealing with Italian indulgence on deadlines... But we are familiar with this by now, so we counted in advance possible delays and took some precautions with the suppliers! We are confident in the stated timeline for delivery and we promise to stay in touch to keep you well informed!<br/><br/></p>
<h3>FAQ<br/>
</h3>
<b>* Can I hang Bike Safe on any type of wall?</b><b><br/></b>We've tested Bike Safe on brick walls, reinforced concrete and drywalls: the anchorage works with them all! In the box you'll find the anchors suitable for the first two, as far as drywall is concerned you'll need to provide the proper ones. The anchorage resistance is guaranteed, what we cannot foresee is the quality of the wall...</div>
<div>

</div>","THE SMARTEST WALL MOUNT EVER.
Conceived as a true piece of design, Bike Safe by Vadolibero is a first in the market. It solves three issues at once: it's the first wall mount lock that holds any kind of bicycle perfectly straight on the wall. At home, in the office, in the garage or... outdoors! It’s beautiful, with its sleek lines it fits any style of apartment or ambience. It’s resistant: engineered to offer a secure locking system, either the thief uses a sledge hammer to remove it from your wall or an electric saw to cut the reinforced stainless steel layers and junctions. And they both are quite noisy activities... Bike Safe by Vadolibero is the most advanced bike wall mount available on the market.



* Designed in Italy
Bike Safe has been conceived with essential, fluid 
lines, emphasised by a sleek satin finish. But you 
don't have to be tricked by the pureness of its shape: its structure 
comes out of 18 different AISI 304 stainless steel components, carefully engineered, and 
carefully lathed and welded by skilled hands. Maybe you'll change your bicycle, Bike Safe will stay with you forever!


INTRODUCING: BIKE SAFE UNIQUENESS




* The tilting base holds any bike straight


Yes, the base that holds your bicycle can compensate the inclination of sloping frames: you can adjust it and hang any kind of bike straight on the wall.



* The tube-shaped bracket is telescopic...


You can customise its depth according to the handlebar: you are free to use Bike Safe with an essential road-bike and with a massive mountain bike, too.



...and it fits them all
Road bike narrow handlebars, of course...


... and the widest mountain bike handlebars, too.







* The anti picking steel lock

The bespoke steel lock is provided with an anti picking radial pins tumbler cylinder (that makes over 250 different combinations) and it carries individual tubular keys (each Bike Safe has its own, you get 3 sets), that you use only to unlock it: it locks automatically, with a click.







* A Technogel™️ pad comes with it

Bike Safe is equipped with a Technogel™️ pad to be stuck on the base, in order to avoid scratches and sliding.


* Indoors and outdoors



Bike Safe is made of top quality satin stainless steel 304, an alloy with a higher corrosion resistance to atmospheric agents than regular steel. You can use it outdoors, on the balcony or in your condo's public courtyard.










* Convenient for maintenanceIt's true: Bike Safe makes it 
very convenient to do a bit of maintenance. While your bike is safely 
parked on it, you can clean it and fix it. 

TALKING ABOUT YOUR EXPENSIVE WHEELS... Bike Safe is the only wall 
mount that aims to beat bike crime in the home, securing the bicycle 
most precious part: the  frame. And that's an absolute first in the 
market! In these first days of the Indiegogo campaign, some people 
pointed out that the expensive wheels could still be stolen... Well, 
here is an easy (and still stylish) solution: use common braided steel 
double loop cables. And if you own an expensive seat post, you can use 
the cable to block that, too!


IN THE BOX


Here in Vadolibero
we want to take seriously all details, the product packing, too. This is how your Bike Safe will
be delivered to your home. 



OUR PERKSHere is the range of the different perks, at the most affordable price you'll ever see, tailored on different needs: it depends on the number of people (and bikes) you want to share Bike Safe with! Plus, you will be the first to wear our Vadolibero hat and t-shirt: they have both a special 
""made in Milano"" twist, in terms of materials and fit, featuring the truest message of our brand: ""I go free"", this is the meaning of Vadolibero in Italian. Try them on!



VADOLIBERO T-SHIRT - 100% organic cotton,  urban fit, L and XL sizes for men; M and L sizes for women. Full black with the logo printed in white.





VADOLIBERO HAT - 5 panels design, 100% polyester front panel and 
mesh rear panels, snapback size

* weight: 4 kg
The materials- Stainless steel 304: widely used for its exceptional forming 
and welding characteristics, it has a higher corrosion resistance than 
regular steel to a wide range of atmospheric environments and many 
corrosive media. For Bike Safe we chose a sophisticated satin finish.- Technogel™️: a unique “soft solid” material, that joins 
together the 3D deformation of a fluid and the memory shape of a solid. 
It’s a completely non-toxic and stable polyurethane substance (made 
without using oils or plasticizers), used in a wide range of 
applications.

* Mounting & securityLast but not least, Bike Safe is very easy to mount on the wall: we provide 4 security anchors (size M6x60mm, together with special allen key and bit) and the targeting mask, you will only need to use your drill. As far as the anchorage is concerned, we've tested Bike Safe on brick walls, reinforced concrete and drywalls:
 it works with them all. In the box, you'll find the anchors suitable 
for the first two, while if you want to hang it on a drywall, you'll 
need to get the ones that fit best its thickness.
*Assembly instruction















Bike Safe accessories


To fit in the most sophisticated surroundings, Bike Safe is equipped with a luxurious wardrobe: made of the finest leather, the same used by made in Italy top design brands, it includes a soft hand-sewed pad, a key holder equipped with a solid carabiner, and a wheel strap. The kit is available in two variants: a dark turtle dove brown and subtle natural leather shade.

Risks and challenges

We've been working for 3 years marketing the products of the Ride Home collection by Vadolibero, learning how to move a prototype to a ready to use product for the market. The Bike Safe has been prototyped and tested by retailers and friends. Your investment will go towards production and shipping. We'll be making the Bike Safe in manufacturing facilities in Brianza, the design district in Northern Italy. We are ready with the whole process. We only need now to reach sufficient quantities to offer the best price with the maximum quality.  However, if we had to pick a risk factor in making this product, it would be dealing with Italian indulgence on deadlines... But we are familiar with this by now, so we counted in advance possible delays and took some precautions with the suppliers! We are confident in the stated timeline for delivery and we promise to stay in touch to keep you well informed!

<p>The challenge was to design an efficient boat with same level features as their big brothers. To do that, we started designing and building this fantastic mini boat from scratch. Considering the success of JimBoats 6.5, we'd like to think that this first challenge is successful !</p>
<p>We are proud to receive hundreds of messages and congratulations from all over the world !</p>
<p>It's now time to share our pleasure with you, and give you the opportunity to enjoy this little ""jewel"" with your kids!</p>

<h3><font color=""steelblue""><i>""Motorboat &amp; Yachting Magazine</i>"" 6.5's presentation:</font></h3>

<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1513873232/soeugyb4fmejp3n7bfw5.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>The latter you’ll be relieved to hear. What you’re looking at here is being touted as the world’s first electric and very eco-friendly mini boat – "" the <strong>Jimboats 6.5</strong>"".</p>
<h3><font color=""steelblue"">Who came up with it and why?</font></h3>
<p>Denis Jimenez is a French designer and boat builder. Married with two sons, it was discovering that his five-year-old grandson was passionate about boating that inspired Denis to build the <strong>JimBoats 6.5</strong> for him.</p>
<h3><font color=""steelblue"">That’s remarkable. How big is it?</font></h3>
<p>It’s just 6.5ft long – that’s exactly 2m. That’s a full half metre less than the beam of a Sea Ray 190 sportsboat, for example.</p>
<h3><font color=""steelblue"">Astonishing. So it would fit in the back of my pick-up?</font></h3>
<p>Absolutely! In fact, there is a promotional shot of it in the bed of a double cab.</p>
<h3><font color=""steelblue"">What makes it go?</font></h3>
<p>A 55lb thrust electric motor spins a 3 blades prop that is concealed within a tunnel, safe from dangling legs or swimmers.</p>
<h3><font color=""steelblue"">How fast is it?</font></h3>
<p>The builder reckons it’ll do about 5.5 knots, controlled by a five-step throttle (limitable) that also offers a single-speed reverse.</p>
<h3><font color=""steelblue"">And how long will it run for?</font></h3>
<p>About four hours on a full charge.</p>
<h3><font color=""steelblue"">Is it just for kids, or can grownups have a play?</font></h3>
<p>It’s aimed predominantly at children, but small adults (up to 5ft 6in and 155lbs) can have a go.</p>
<p><a href=""http://www.mediafire.com/view/?r88rgura8ln5jpe"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><img alt=""Simple, Free Image and File Hosting at MediaFire"" border=""0"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.mediafire.com/convkey/51e4/r88rgura8ln5jpe6g.jpg"" src=""""/></a></p>
<p> </p>
<h3><font color=""steelblue"">So where can I buy one and how much are they?</font></h3>
<p>At the moment only a few exist. Denis is currently seeking crowdfunding investors with the intention of putting the boat into series build. If he succeeds in getting the necessary funding (never a given in the boating world), he expects the finished product to cost between $3,500 and $4,000.</p>

</div></div>","The challenge was to design an efficient boat with same level features as their big brothers. To do that, we started designing and building this fantastic mini boat from scratch. Considering the success of JimBoats 6.5, we'd like to think that this first challenge is successful !
We are proud to receive hundreds of messages and congratulations from all over the world !
It's now time to share our pleasure with you, and give you the opportunity to enjoy this little ""jewel"" with your kids!
Many thanks again for your warm support !
 
 
Because ""others"" talk about it so much better...
 
""Motorboat & Yachting Magazine"" 6.5's presentation:
Is that a large child or an extraordinarily small boat?

The latter you’ll be relieved to hear. What you’re looking at here is being touted as the world’s first electric and very eco-friendly mini boat – "" the Jimboats 6.5"".
Who came up with it and why?
Denis Jimenez is a French designer and boat builder. Married with two sons, it was discovering that his five-year-old grandson was passionate about boating that inspired Denis to build the JimBoats 6.5 for him.
That’s remarkable. How big is it?
It’s just 6.5ft long – that’s exactly 2m. That’s a full half metre less than the beam of a Sea Ray 190 sportsboat, for example.
Astonishing. So it would fit in the back of my pick-up?
Absolutely! In fact, there is a promotional shot of it in the bed of a double cab.
What makes it go?
A 55lb thrust electric motor spins a 3 blades prop that is concealed within a tunnel, safe from dangling legs or swimmers.
How fast is it?
The builder reckons it’ll do about 5.5 knots, controlled by a five-step throttle (limitable) that also offers a single-speed reverse.
And how long will it run for?
About four hours on a full charge.
Is it just for kids, or can grownups have a play?
It’s aimed predominantly at children, but small adults (up to 5ft 6in and 155lbs) can have a go.

 
So where can I buy one and how much are they?
At the moment only a few exist. Denis is currently seeking crowdfunding investors with the intention of putting the boat into series build. If he succeeds in getting the necessary funding (never a given in the boating world), he expects the finished product to cost between $3,500 and $4,000.

Yes. JimBoats 6.5  is delivered complete and ready to use.
6. How long will JimBoats 6.5 run for?
Approximately 4 hours at full speed depending on the weight of the crew. It could be 6 hours or more at low speed !
7. What about the battery?
Our goal is not to earn money by selling batteries or to force you to buy our batteries. This is the reason why we decided to use ""Marine grade Bluetop"" batteries from Optima. You can buy these batteries everywhere in the world!
8. How long does it take to fully charge the battery?
For a JimBoats 6.5  with standard ""D34M""- 55Ah battery, approximately 5~6 hours with the specific ""Optima battery charger"" or 7~9 hours and with a ""classic"" battery charger for cars, trucks etc...
9. What is the maximum size to ride a JimBoats 6.5 mini boat ?
We recommend under 170cm (5'6"") for the best riding experience.
10. What is the maximum weight to ride a JimBoats 6.5 mini boat ?

12. I want to be a distributor or retailer, where do I start?
We are open to distributors and retailers worldwide once our initial crowdfunding campaign ends.

The urban mobility revolution is here. Featuring the longest mileage from Segway-Ninebot, robust tires, and a body made for all terrains, yet still offered at the most attractive price, the Ninebot KickScooter MAX is here to spark a change. The MAX is ideal for all kinds of riders, terrains, and journeys.
 

Press kit is available for download here
Most electric scooters face the problem of limited mileage and battery life. The Ninebot KickScooter MAX changes this with a battery capacity of 551Wh that almost triples the mileage on the Ninebot KickScooter ES2. With a MAX range of 40 miles, you can easily ride 162 laps around a standard running track in a single charge, or complete a full marathon PLUS another half marathon. Go green by commuting to work on your MAX and recharge it only once a week.
Riding on rough roads can be challenging for electric scooter users. We understand that and want to make your journey more comfortable. Drawing inspiration from bicycle designs, we developed 10-inch tubeless pneumatic tires with the shock-absorption to make your ride smoother and more stable, even on rough surfaces or speed bumps.
                
With revolutionary upgrades to the propulsion power, you can now enjoy greater freedom and convenience when you cruise around on your MAX. The high torque motor gives the MAX a top speed of up to 15.5-18.6mph on level ground. The 350W-700W of power provides the MAX with sustainable propulsion on all kinds of road conditions.
Say goodbye to having a spinning wheel when your electric scooter is going up a steep slope, MAX can climb slopes around 20%, allowing it to go uphill easily. Rear-wheel drive offers you a better solution to acceleration, stability, and brake. 
     The MAX comes with a one-step folding system that makes it the ultimate electric scooter for people who are always on the go.  The built-in charger lets you recharge it easily when you’re on the go without having to carry along a bulky charging device. You just need to bring along a pocketable cord similar to a phone charging cable. The new charger is more efficient than before. The MAX can be fully charged in 6 hours, two times faster than any previous electric scooters.
                      

The MAX has an aviation-grade aluminum alloy frame that gives it a strong body and also has the carrying capacity of  220 lbs or 100 kg.
We designed the MAX with the enterprise scooter-sharing market in mind. The improved structure along with other feature updates such as resistance rating of IPX5 for the whole body (IPX7 water resistance to its core components) and various durability upgrades ensure that the MAX will be your faithful, long-serving companion.
One major concern for scooter riding is to have a flat tire. With the self-healing tire feature, when the tires’ outer layers are punctured, the sealant within the tire fills the holes automatically. The MAX tire can withstand multiple punctures (less than 6mm in diameter) without leaks, so you won't experience the nightmare of replacing tires.  
Our MAX received huge support from backers all over the world. We decided to add the new feature of self-healing tire as our way to say ’Thank You ‘. 

 


Lock controls: you can also lock your MAX with a single swipe to the right.
Scooter status: displays information about your MAX such as remaining mileage, speeds
Riding modes: Select from 3 different modes for different scenarios

         ‘ECO’ is the economic model with a maximum speed of 10km/h (6.2 mph)         ‘D’ is the standard drive mode with a maximum speed of 20km/h (12.4 mph)         ‘S’ is the sport mode with a maximum speed up to 25-30km/h (15.5-18.6 mph)

Overall, MAX is the perfect choice for mobility, it allows you to move from point A to point B while enjoying the time you spent. You won't be tired even with 10 miles daily commute or a short trip, and no need to worry about the range issue. Ride on and explore your city and countryside in a new way!

Why E-scooter transportation is not just a flashy trend, but a sustainable lifestyle?

Less energy consumption: Statistics shows electric scooter holding a great advantage over energy consumption, comparing to other vehicles. ​


Cost-effective: You can save a lot of money if you opt for electric scooters over gas or electric vehicles.


Cost of purchase:  MAX priced at around 1% of the electric car, one of the most affordable choices to go green.

With its edge on energy consumption, cost of use and price, we believe in our combat with global warming, the electric scooter may offer us the best chance to win regarding transport energy.

Reduces congestion and pollution 

City congestion and pollution cost urban dwellers not only wasted time and money but the overall quality of life. The electric scooter has been proven to substantially reduce congestion in most urban areas. 
Greener solution for cities. And burns more calories than a bus, light rail or car riding!

By switching to electric scooter riding, urban areas can save a lot of space otherwise used for parking.  These areas can be reutilized to help solve the increased housing demand and provide green areas for a better community.
The more healthy way to transport                 
On matter what you heard about the electric scooter, you will feel more energetic and happy when you riding on it. It burns more calories than taking a bus or driving yourself.",58.0,0,"10 Campaigns

It’s a global community that respects creativity over competition and perseverance over perfection. Way beyond a sport, skaters share a spirit. </p><p>So we thought: <strong>What if your skateboard could express all the shades of your signature style, even when it’s standing still? </strong>  </p><p>Sure, you’ve got the classic stickers and Sharpies, but those can fall flat on durability and pop. And sure, you can completely dismantle your board to swap one deck for another, but quality replacement decks don’t come cheap; and putting your ride back together is hardly an easy feat. Even for an expert, it’s a quarter of an hour you could otherwise spend shredding:</p><div>

It’s a global community that respects creativity over competition and perseverance over perfection. Way beyond a sport, skaters share a spirit. So we thought: What if your skateboard could express all the shades of your signature style, even when it’s standing still?   Sure, you’ve got the classic stickers and Sharpies, but those can fall flat on durability and pop. And sure, you can completely dismantle your board to swap one deck for another, but quality replacement decks don’t come cheap; and putting your ride back together is hardly an easy feat. Even for an expert, it’s a quarter of an hour you could otherwise spend shredding:

 
The WarDrobe Patent: Anatomy of InnovationAs a collective of artists, entrepreneurs, and champions of personal flavor, we wanted to make skaters a board that reflects the same freedom of creativity you feel when you cruise—from your mood of the day, to a favorite character or sports team to your favorite social cause. So instead of creating a collection of decks, we created strong and flexible skins that snap onto the sturdy decks of our proprietary WarDrobe Motherboard.We knew that our technology had to be fool proof and fast. If kids couldn’t relate to our intuitive design as easily AND seamlessly as they handle a smartphone, we were going back to the drawing board. And most importantly, we knew that skaters didn’t just want an awesome accessory…they demanded a legit foundation that even the most seasoned pros would be proud to ride.7 years, 10 prototypes, and endless test runs later, our team of engineers, pro skate icons, and amazingly talented artists have helped us bring our idea from drawing board to reality. We cannot be more proud or more excited to share the 1st generation of WarDrobe skateboards with you. The patented WarDrobe Interchangeable Faceplate Skateboard System (IFSS) is a first-of-its-kind skateboard kit that allows you to switch up the style of your board in minutes, with no complicated diagrams.
Premium Structure. Personal Style. For seasoned pros, first-timers, and all our friends in between, every WarDrobe Motherboard is a smooth-riding machine crafted with hardware from the industry’s most well-respected brands.  From bearings to trucks, the WarDrobe crew knows what skaters demand from their boards.Our commitment to you is a fresh skateboard experience that delivers an unprecedented level of professional functionality and personal flavor.  When we took our final prototype to the streets, this is what a few of our new fans had to say:

How It Works: Got Hands? You’re Golden.The WarDrobe Interchangeable Faceplate Skateboard System required exactly two tools and about 1 minute.

Watch this demo video of our friends in action: Learn More About The War*Drobe Mission First Generation Faceplates What are the funds for? (I'm glad you asked)WarDrobe is looking to make a more cost effective skateboard for consumers in our next production run. We need to raise funds to help find different components that will help scale the business and lower the cost for the end user without significantly compromising quality and performance.

<p>  I’m Jesse Morgan, </p>
<p>I was motivated to invent the <strong><i>EXTRACTOR</i></strong> due to my own serious accident 10 years ago. I was hit head-on by a drunk driver, rolled my car and was trapped upside down as my car caught fire.  A family driving by stopped, broke my side window and cut my seatbelt to get me out … they are my heroes … they saved my life. My accident and others like it I’ve heard over the years led me to invent a multi-purpose, easy access device, that can save lives in these situations.</p>

<p align=""center""><strong><i>You Don’t Need it ‘Till You Do … Then It’s a LIFE SAVING Tool!</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><u>What We Need</u></strong><strong>:</strong></p>
<p>We are now moving aggressively to transition from our successful “Proof of Concept” Prototype to our first production run of 5,000 units.  We need $35,000 to accomplish this critical phase of bringing the <strong><i>EXTRACTOR</i></strong> to market. </p>
<p><strong><u>What You Get</u></strong><strong>:</strong></p>
<p>We’ve created an attractive range of “Perks” associated with various donation or investment levels for this campaign. With the exception of our lowest level, each one features the EXTRACTOR  tool in varying quantities, so you will get the safety and protection my invention provides.  With the higher level packages, several tools are provided so you can share the “Gift of Life” among your loved ones and others that could benefit from our vehicle safety tool.</p>
<p><strong><u>The Impact</u></strong><strong>:</strong></p>
<p>There are over 255 million vehicles on the road in the US … over 1.2 Billion worldwide. In 2015, there were over 6 million car accidents each year, with 27% of those resulting in injury and 6% resulting in a fatality.  Not ONE of us ever thinks we’ll get in a car accident, let alone a serious one involving a rollover or other trapped situation. But, they happen all too often and when they do, you will have only a matter of seconds to act to save your life or the life of someone you love. Stats show that you are likely to witness 2-3 serious accidents in your lifetime. The <strong><i>EXTRACTOR</i></strong> is designed to be out-of-sight but always within easy and secure reach, ready to spring into action when your need arises.</p>
<p><strong><u>Risks and Challenges</u></strong><strong>:</strong></p>
<p>Most of the risks and challenges have already been overcome through testing and extensive design review during our very successful Prototype development phase.</p>
<ul>
<li>Funding (amount &amp; continuity)<ul><li>A risk common to many startups. We are working several parallel channels to acquire adequate start-up funds for immediate and 6-12 month funding. This is to ensure necessary early product development,  production, and proper cash flow until sales are sufficient to sustain on-going operations and growth.</li></ul>
</li>
<li>Overseas manufacturing and shipping … potential delays and added expense<ul><li>Using high quality but lower cost manufacturing in China is attractive from a cost perspective BUT can be challenging and somewhat risky without experience and proper management. We have retained a US expert in the selection and management of Chinese manufacturers. Using this expert, we have made our “source selection” of the best choice for our needs, and this consultant has already traveled to meet and coordinate with them several times to work key production issues such as mold development, materials selection, scheduling, etc.</li></ul>
</li>
<li>Market penetration given the range and maturity of existing competitors:<ul>
<li>The market for vehicle “EXTRACTOR” tools is by no means new and includes several competitors. We have done extensive research into our competition to ensure that we have a unique and attractive product that is priced to compete. We offer several KEY discriminating features not provided by ANY other competitor:<ul>
<li>
<strong>Sun Visor Mounting</strong> for quick, secure and easy access, even when trapped by your seatbelt upside down. Every other competing device is mounted or stored OUT OF REACH!</li>
<li>
<strong>Carbon Tungsten Tip</strong> for our glass breaker. Others without this quality have proven to fail when tested.</li>
<li>
<strong>Super Sharp Belt Cutter w/Longer Access Glide </strong>to ensure easier use during stressful and time urgent application.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Added features  augment basic functions (ice scraper edge for snow &amp; ice, hex bit 1/4 to 1/2 inch heads, ruler) that make our tool very competitive.</li>

<p style=""text-align: center;""><br/></p>
<h1 style=""text-align: center;"">BACKGROUND</h1>
<br/>The
MelonBoard was designed to be easy to use, lightweight, portable and have enough
range to take you anywhere. The board weighs in at less than 13 pounds
competing with the top 3 brands on the market. The motor gives enough power to
take you <b>18 miles per hour and take you 18 miles per charge.</b> Everything is controlled
through a radio frequency remote that allows you to control acceleration and braking<br/><p style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px;""><br/></p>
<p style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px;""><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Whether you are going to class, work, running errands or go to the beach, small distances have always been a problem. Not only do you build up a sweat when you take your bicycle those 10 kilometers to work, you also have to find a place to lock it. At MelonBoard we though it had to be a better, more affordable solution. There are a lot of different electric skateboards on the market, but they are either <b>$1000</b> or more. We wanted to make an affordable solution to the short distance problem and the high price on electric longboards. Our early backers will get the board for  <b>$499</b>  making it the best priced electric longboard on the market. </span><br/></p>
<br/><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">We have been working on making the board perfect over the last 2 years and have finally made a model that suits every rider. The time engineering and designing the Melonboard have been an amazing and fun adventure, and we can not wait until it gets out on the market. All this is now a reality because of the world class team I put together. I have done most of the part myself, but there are times where you have to let professionals do the work. There have been a lot of people helping me on the way to this point, and thanks to them, the Melonboard dream will come true.

<br/></b><p>MelonBoard has a 9 layer high quality Canadian Maple deck. It is known to be flexible and strong. We have chosen the most durable grip tapes to withstand everyday use. Our motor is compact, durable and strong. We have chosen a simple, yet highly durable belt design following the ""Keep it simple stupid"". The motor has almost 2 horsepowers making it really strong and can take you up a 15 degree at 10 miles per hour. Both the deck, trucks, battery case, belt, and motor have a matt casual design where our light green wheels make a huge color contrast. The history behind this was that electric longboard in Norway was not totally legal on public roads so I tried to make it not noticeable. <br/><br/></p>

<br/>
<p>
</p>
<p><b>Can I ride the
Melonboard in the rain?<br/></b>
No! It is not safe to ride a longboard in the rain. It is very slippery and the water may damage the electronics. All the electronics are hidden under a cover
underneath the deck. Water damage is not covered by the warranty! The cover is
not waterproof or dust proof. We recommend driving the Melonboard in the same
weather conditions as  you would for a normal longboard.<br/>
<br/><b>
What is the riders weight limit on the board?<br/></b>
The riders weight limit is 100 kg.<br/>
 </p>
<p><b>Can I push it like a
normal board?<br/></b>
Yes of course. You will experience a small drag because of the drivetrain connected to the rear wheel.  Other than that you can cruise like normal longboard.<br/>
 <br/></p>
<p><b>Is the battery
switchable?<br/></b>
Yes, but with right tools. Be carefull when removing the battery case, wires to the motor are still attached. <br/><br/><b>How do i get a new battery?<br/></b>From our website.<br/>
 </p>
<p><b>How do I control the
board?<br/></b>You controll the Melonboard with a radio frequency remote controller allowing you
to control acceleration and braking.<br/>
 </p>
<p><b>Can I ride the
Melonboard up very steep hills?<br/></b>
Yes of course, but no steeper than 15 %.<br/><br/><b>Can I brake going downhill?</b><br/>No, the motor may get overheated. For the riders safety we highly recommend not to go down hill. The motor is fixed with the wheels. Turn OFF the Melonboard and ride it as a normal longboard.</p>
<p>
<br/><b>
Are there places where I can try a Melonboard before buying one?<br/></b>
The Melonboard Team will post through our Facebook page promotion tours all
around USA and Europe. We are trying to put Melonboards in local skateshops where people can try before purchasing. <br/>
 </p>
<p><b>What will be the
retail price?<br/></b>
The MelonBoard will be retailed for a maximum price of $799<br/>
 </p>

indiegogo campaign, we will prioritize world wide shipping as number 1.<br/>-This does not include Alaska or Hawaii.<br/>
 </p>
<p><b>What is the
warranty?<br/></b>
The warranty is 90 days against manufacturing defects.<br/>
 </p>
<p><b>Where can I get
replacement parts?<br/></b>Replacement parts are easily purchased off our website.<br/>

Stretch Goals




MelonBoard is a highly portable transportation device that has an amazing range, top speed and power.

BACKGROUND
The
MelonBoard was designed to be easy to use, lightweight, portable and have enough
range to take you anywhere. The board weighs in at less than 13 pounds
competing with the top 3 brands on the market. The motor gives enough power to
take you 18 miles per hour and take you 18 miles per charge. Everything is controlled
through a radio frequency remote that allows you to control acceleration and braking
Whether you are going to class, work, running errands or go to the beach, small distances have always been a problem. Not only do you build up a sweat when you take your bicycle those 10 kilometers to work, you also have to find a place to lock it. At MelonBoard we though it had to be a better, more affordable solution. There are a lot of different electric skateboards on the market, but they are either $1000 or more. We wanted to make an affordable solution to the short distance problem and the high price on electric longboards. Our early backers will get the board for  $499  making it the best priced electric longboard on the market. 
We have been working on making the board perfect over the last 2 years and have finally made a model that suits every rider. The time engineering and designing the Melonboard have been an amazing and fun adventure, and we can not wait until it gets out on the market. All this is now a reality because of the world class team I put together. I have done most of the part myself, but there are times where you have to let professionals do the work. There have been a lot of people helping me on the way to this point, and thanks to them, the Melonboard dream will come true. With a lot of support from family and friends, I built the MelonBoard to be simple to use, breathtaking design and mind blowing to ride.              Melonboard hoodie: $40                                         Melonboard T-shirt: $25

Radical Illumination for the Bold & Inspired: Epic LEDs is dedicated to creating easy-to-install and use stand-alone LED strip light kits for bicycles, motorcycles, scooters and more. Our kits feature 12V Lithium power for brighter longer lasting lighting impact. Our rechargeable battery pack comes with a water resistant zipper case and integrates into the LED strip lights system with quick-connect connectors. Epic LED kits come in a variety of colors including RGB variable colors.

Background Story
 My name is Christopher Wiggins and I have devoted most of my career to designing and developing consumer products in the sporting goods and light electric vehicle space. I recently founded Epic LEDs as a pilot project to help support our other primary business Glide Cruisers, USA. In 2010, I founded Glide which designs and manufacturers a premium line of electric-drive stand-up cycles: 



Although we have seen some success, We have been doing everything we can to grow this company on a bootstrap budget! Earlier this year, we started engineering on a new budget model series (SR line) that will help grow our business and the Glide brand! And we are excited about it: 



However, these models will not have ""built-in"" lighting like our first model series and thus I felt the need for stand-alone light accessories. So earlier this year I created Epic LEDs to help accessorize the new models for Glide, but also found that nobody in the field had done a self-powered 12V LED lighting kit for bikes, motorcycles or scooters. The key was that I needed a compact rechargeable 12V battery that could easily be attached to a bike or motorcycle in addition to quick-connect LED strip features in an easy to install light kit. 







End result - after working with a number of key suppliers, I have devised a great series of LED light kits that will be perfect for Glide and I think a fun and functional solution for bicycle, motorcycle and scooter enthusiasts! Here's a few highlights:

Rechargeable 12V Lithium Battery produces super bright and vibrant light Modular kit with quick-connect lights have glue strips and are easy to install Water resistant Zipper Case for Battery Velcro's to bike frame
Lots of fun colors to choose from Including RGB Variable colors. 















So this campaign, if successful will help launch our new series of LED light kits and also support the growth and success of Glide with our highly anticipated new line of products for 2016! 
Thank you for reading this far! If intrigued - please continue on. 

What We Need & What You Get

You can choose any of our flights which are all at flat fares (so you always know what you'll pay), typically 20 to 50€ lower than the market, at the last minute (up to 7 days before departure). There again, no research, no booking. You will get your tickets in 2 mins. The Unlimited Pass: Coming in 2019Here again, the principle is very simple. It's an unlimited pass for last-minute flights! You pay a monthly subscription to fly as much as you want! THE REWARDS“Today you are you, that is truer than true.  There is no one alive who is youer than you.”Notes:1 €10:  Thank you!  Your contribution keeps us rolling.  We’ll sign you up for our exclusive deals, travel news, and our cool city Adventure Plans.  Expect to see departures from London, Barcelona, Madrid, Berlin, Amsterdam soon in 2018 and we’ll let you know when they’re live.  Also be the first to get alerted when we extend our offerings (city alerts, last-min hotels, upgrades)2 €50:  Club membership.  1-year membership (flights not included) to the FlyScribe portal where you can choose from a list of destinations, all at flat fares, typically €20-€50 lower than market prices. No additional monthly payment.  For those outside our current/next cities:  sign up now and your membership will continue from now until a year after we launch your city!  Note:  outside the Indiegogo campaign we will be offering this at €10/mo, so now is your chance to save €70 by paying upfront and supporting us!3 €90:  Club membership for TWO. Bring a friend! 1-year membership (flights not included) FOR TWO to the FlyScribe club. Yes, it can be a different friend each time. No additional monthly payment. Want to take off next weekend? Don't bother searching. You always know what you'll pay.

Vous obtiendrez vos billets en 2min.  Le Pass Illimité: Courant 2019.La encore le principe est très simple. C’est un pass navigo, mais pour les vols à la dernière minute !

Actuellement, nous proposons des vols au départ de Paris, mais nous déploierons de nouvelles villes en 2018.  Attendez-vous à voir Londres, Barcelone, Madrid, Berlin, Amsterdam durant la seconde partie de 2018.€50 : 1 an d'abonnement (vols non inclus) au portail FlyScribe où vous pouvez choisir parmi une liste de destinations, toutes à des tarifs forfaitaires, généralement entre 20 et 50€ de moins que les prix du marché. Aucun paiement mensuel supplémentaire.  Pour ceux qui sont à l'extérieur de nos villes actuelles et futures : inscrivez-vous maintenant et votre adhésion se poursuivra jusqu'à un an après le lancement de votre ville ! Note : en dehors de la campagne Indiegogo, nous vous offrirons ce service à 10€/mois, vous avez donc maintenant la possibilité d'économiser 70€ en payant d'avance et en nous soutenant !€90:  1 an d'abonnement pour DEUX. Amenez un ami ! Adhésion d'un an (vols non inclus) POUR DEUX au club FlyScribe. Oui, il peut s'agir d'un ami différent à chaque fois. Tu veux partir le week-end prochain ? Ne vous donnez pas la peine de chercher.

Le Mystery Flight est là !0€ : Vous pouvez encore aider !  Partagez la campagne et participez à notre concours pour un prix cool (surprise !).  Plus vous partagez, plus vous obtenez de chance de gagner. CE DONT ON A BESOINNous avons besoin d'aide et de temps pour développer toutes nos idées. Nous sommes complètement investis dans le projet et tout l’argent que nous récoltons est investi dans l'entreprise - son succès est notre seul préoccupation.  Voici en détail ce que nous ferons de l’argent:Timeline Pour le moment nous offrons des départs de Paris pour l’Europe. Nous planifions l’ouverture d’autre villes durant l’été 2018.Pour ceux d’entre vous qui contribueront à hauteur de 50€, votre abonnement d’un an commencera au moment où nous ouvrirons dans votre ville. JUSQU'ICI...Nous avons démarré l’aventure FlyScribe en Septembre 2017 et depuis, nous ne nous arrêtons plus !  Nous avons envoyé notre premier FlyScriber à Porto pour un week end et avons près de 400 personnes sur notre mailing list. Nous parcourons les plus grandes compétitions de startup du monde pour présenter notre projet. Nous avons été finalistes aux MBA Odyssey à New York et au EU Startup Summit à Barcelone, la plus grosse compétition européenne. Nous pitchons dans diverses compétitions à Paris et nous avons même eu la chance de remporter le concours Mentor Day à Tenerife dédié aux startups du tourisme.Du côté des compagnies aériennes, nous avons obtenu notre premier ""Oui"" et nous avons déjà commencé à offrir leurs vols. Un acteur mondial majeur est également intéressé pour travailler avec nous et nous a demandé une version exclusive de notre service. Nous sommes toujours en discussion sur ce point, mais nous nourrissons de grands espoirs pour construire quelque chose d’énorme !Nous avons également eu la chance d’intégrer Station F, le plus grand campus de startup en Europe. QUI SOMMES NOUS ?Nous sommes un groupe de “travel junkies” qui ont pour mission de “secouer” l’industrie aérienne. Récemment diplômés du MBA d’HEC Paris et d’INSEAD, nous n’en pouvions plus de nos métiers dans de grosses boîtes et nous avons décidé de lancer un business dans une industrie qui à grandement besoin de changement. Nous avons maintenant besoin de votre aide pour y arriver !Nous voulons construire quelque chose d'amusant, un peu fou et, espérons-le, qui fera bouger les lignes. Nous débordons d'idées et d’énergie, et n’avons pas peur de tester nos idées parfois farfelus !Cette industrie a besoin d'une transformation majeure. Secouons les chose et apportons transparence, flexibilité et simplicité. Ensemble, nous pouvons y arriver ! A PROPOS DES FONDATEURSL’un de nous fait de la plongée sous-marine de nuit, l’autre est passionné d’art martiaux, le troisième adore Wikipedia. A nous trois nous avons voyagé dans dans plus de 100 pays. Nous parlons en GIF, apprécions les films de Will Ferrell/Jim Carrey, et aimons perturber les choses. NOTRE IMPACTNotre objectif n'est pas de lever un peu de capitaux et de faire ce projet tranquillement dans notre coin.Notre mentalité est la suivante : Soit nous construisons le prochain AirBnB, soit nous faisons autre chose.Mais comme Rome ne s’est pas construite en un jour, et encore moins toute seule, nous avons besoin de vous.SI nous pouvons compter sur votre soutien, cela représentera une force qui nous aidera énormément lors de nos négociations avec les compagnies aériennes. RISQUES ET CHALLENGESLe succès de cette entreprise (tel que nous envisageons actuellement) repose sur des partenariats avec les compagnies aériennes. À ce jour, toutes les compagnies aériennes auxquelles nous avons parlé ont manifesté un grand intérêt. L’une d’elles nous a même demandé une exclusivité ! Cependant, la bureaucratie fait obstacle. Cette lenteur du processus décisionnel est un risque pour nous et augmente nos coûts. Le temps reste de l’argent, et c’est aujourd’hui notre seul resources.Alors comment faire pour accélérer le processus ? Les compagnies aériennes sont comme tous les business, elles sont attirées par l'appât du gain. Si nous sommes en mesure de leur montrer une forte demande de votre part, la chaîne de décision avancera plus vite. POUR FINIRVous voulez aider, mais vous ne pouvez pas ou n'avez pas envie d'apporter une contribution financière ? Aidez-nous en partageant le lien de la campagne sur votre facebook ou linkedin ! Chaque geste compte !Si vous avez pris le temps de lire jusqu'ici, sachez que cela nous touche et que nous vous remercions chaleureusement. Avant toute chose, notre but est de vivre une aventure entrepreneuriale excitante et nous sommes heureux de pouvoir compter sur le moindre soutien.N’hésitez pas à nous contacter, nous serons ravis d'entendre vos commentaires et d'entrer en contact avec vous tous. Un grand Merci !",29.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Staying Gold</h3>
<p>I've adopted the phrase ""Stay Gold"" as a reminder to myself that life is full of Gold moments. To me, Staying Gold is about finding or creating these gold moments in life. Stay Gold Karaoke is a boutique karaoke experience in a van. It is a unique way to experience gold moments full of music, friends and microphones, as well as a reminder to look for the gold in your everyday life.</p>
<p>The business has investors, but the renovation costs are higher than initially anticipated.  Any gold you contribute to this campaign will go towards the costs of renovations to the 15-passenger Ford Transit, into a 70s style karaoke lounge on wheels.  With your help, we will be able to finish all the renovations and be rolling on the road by August. </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>To pay for the remaining renovations we need more funding. This campaign is for $10,000, which will cover a majority of the remaining renovation costs, while private investments will cover the rest. Whatever funds are raised through this campaign will go towards the renovation costs. </p>
<p>Your contributions come with Stay Gold perks! The perks include being a part of this unique and exciting business, through adding tunes to the Stay Gold Top 40 Playlist, VIP membership, discounts and more! </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Your contributions to Stay Gold Karaoke will make this dream a reality. The world can use a little more joy right now, and Stay Gold Karaoke will bring just that. This unique and positive experience will be rolling around the streets of Los Angeles full of all kinds of passengers. Besides the regular karaoke lovers and party celebrations, Stay Gold Karaoke is committed to giving elderly populations this unique experience during the day.</p>

<p>Starting a business is always a risk. Obstacles have already presented themselves several times over in this journey.

<p>I'm known as someone who ""makes things happen"".  I take risks and look at obstacles with thoughtful, extensive, and careful evaluation. Stay Gold Karaoke is one of those things I can't not do (I apologize for the double negative), so it's happening. </p>

<p>If you love being outdoors and love to bike, the RBIKE is for you. This revolutionary new line of electric bicycles enables you to ride faster, farther and quieter, and can adapt to all kinds of conditions.</p>
<p>I’ve been cycling all my life and have been frustrated at the lack of a reliable, affordably-priced electric bicycle. So I assembled a team of engineers and designers to develop a top-of-line ebike that doesn't cost a fortune.</p>
<p>It’s finally here: the Rbike.

<p>Everyone enjoys a nice bicycle ride but sometimes the hilly trails are just too demanding. You can use the motor when riding up a hill or when you get tired. If you feel like pedaling a traditional bicycle, you can turn off the motor and ride without any mechanical assistance.  <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""> </span></p>

<p>RBIKE enables riders of all ages and abilities to enjoy cycling. It’s fun for the whole family.

</div></div></div>","Introducing the high-performance RBIKE100 km (62 miles) on a single charge!Faster, farther, quieter and more fun in all kinds of conditions  Available for delivery anywhere in the world 
If you love being outdoors and love to bike, the RBIKE is for you. This revolutionary new line of electric bicycles enables you to ride faster, farther and quieter, and can adapt to all kinds of conditions.
I’ve been cycling all my life and have been frustrated at the lack of a reliable, affordably-priced electric bicycle. So I assembled a team of engineers and designers to develop a top-of-line ebike that doesn't cost a fortune.
It’s finally here: the Rbike. Prices start at just $599 USD.
Everyone enjoys a nice bicycle ride but sometimes the hilly trails are just too demanding. You can use the motor when riding up a hill or when you get tired. If you feel like pedaling a traditional bicycle, you can turn off the motor and ride without any mechanical assistance.   
Use it for your daily commute. Utilize RBIKE’s motorized capability on the way to work so you don’t show up all sweaty, then ride in manual mode on the way home to get some exercise.
RBIKE enables riders of all ages and abilities to enjoy cycling. It’s fun for the whole family. Anyone who likes riding, sports, exercising and being close to nature will enjoy riding the RBIKE. You do not need a special permit or license to operate it. Our electric bicycle is great for serious cyclists and casual riders. It can be used for several types of riding:

Road Bikes: Light weight, Speed, Ergonomic

Mountain Bikes: Rigid Frame, High Performance Suspension and Tires

Cross Country: Comfortable (on Long tours)



One of the keys is our specially designed frame in order to vastly improve the overall stability of the bike. It has a unique bending part that reduces direct shock to the frame and allows riders to feel confident even on bumpy mountain road.
Rbike is equipped with a 9Ah rechargeable lithium battery, which has reached ranges over 100km on a single charge with pedal assist.You also can charge your mobile phones on the USB port specially made for the Rbike. This makes your busy life manageable and you don't have to worry about running out of battery during long tours. We provide a multi-use USB cable for easy connecting both iPhone and Android devices. The battery can be removed from the bike for indoor recharging.We made 2 versions of Rbike to adapt for different riding needs. The main difference of R6 and R6X is the drive motor. If you live in a really hilly area and you wish to have a lot of torque and power to go quickly on hills, R6X would be for you. The 48V 750W motor allows to attain Federal regulated top speed of 20mph with little pedaling effort. 

Alexander Brincker is the lead of our design team. As Technical Director for international bicycles of Ferrari, Lamborghini and Jeep, Alex has a wealth of experience and many cutting-edge ideas.   With the RBIKE, he has combined the features of a mountain bike, road bike and city bike, enabling cyclists to ride anywhere and do it further, faster and in a most comfortable way.   
All the Rbikes were and will be finished in Komda Industrial (SZ). Komda was founded in 1988, the factory with a total constructed area of 45,000 m2 is well equipped with the most up-to-date facilities and softwares and has grown into one of the most important manufacturing bases for a number of renowned brands in medium & high end bicycles and E-bikes.

What I discovered was the cost of carsharing was too high for me to drive these cars regularly and when I needed a vehicle it was sometimes hard to find. My average monthly bill was around $600 (between 3 of the 4 operators in Vancouver). While it was fun to drive around in a Mercedes, it wasn't cheap! At the same time, costs of owning my own car are also on the rise. Check out this link from AAA (<a href=""http://newsroom.aaa.com/auto/your-driving-costs/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://newsroom.aaa.com/auto/your-driving-costs/</a>). </p><p>When I suggested to my wife Liina that there has to be a better more affordable way to carshare, she suggested we should do something about it. We set out to create an affordable carshare to entice more people to give up their car and at the same time bring the cost of a trip down so that it won't hurt your wallet. What we found was by putting advertising on the cars we could bring the cost down and even pay everyone to drive. </p><h3><strong>We are going to build our fleet from the ground up and need your support</strong></h3><p>All of your contributions will go to purchasing vehicles and equipment. We have 3 plans to choose from;</p><ul>
<li>Gold plan - $89 a month includes your first 2 hours FREE PER TRIP and subsequent hours are $6.99 per hour.</li>
<li>Silver plan - $49 a month includes your first hour FREE PER TRIP and subsequent hours are $6.99 per hour.</li>
<li>Bronze Plan - Pay-as-you-go $6.99 per hour or as little as .25 cents a minute.</li>
</ul><p>If you choose the monthly plans, you can earn stars for every paid hour you drive and for every 30 minute portion of unused free time after driving 20 km (each star is valued at $0.25). You can use the stars to offset the cost of your driving expenses or towards the purchase of gift cards, promo items and ""advertiser"" products. Imagine driving for free or even getting paid!</p><h3><strong>Traffic congestion and automobile pollution will be a thing of the past</strong></h3><p>And we believe Vancouver will be the epicentre of this phenomenon. Currently, Vancouver is ranked #2 greenest city in North America on (<a href=""https://www.worldatlas.com/articles/the-greenest-cities-in-north-america.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.worldatlas.com/articles/the-greenes...</a>). With your help we will advance to #1. Our goal is to start with small cars and build a fleet of hybrid vehicles. Once the electric infrastructure is more complete and electric vehicles increase their range a bit more, we intend to operate electric vehicles only. Our long term goal is to connect our vehicles around the country (like one big carshare) and eventually around the world. This means you could pick up your car in Vancouver and drop it in Calgary and vice versa.  We are constantly looking to partner with transit providers, municipalities, governments and large companies to make it even easier for you to give up your car or at least leave it at home. The way we see it, our Gold Plan is better than a bus pass!</p><h3><strong>You might be thinking what happens in the event of an accident?</strong></h3><p>Your only responsibility in an at fault accident is to pay the deductible (just like if you owned the car). You have the option of buying deductible insurance which will pay the deductible in the event you need it. Your credit card company may also pay this but it is your responsibility to make sure they do.</p><h3><strong>The Competition</strong></h3><p>Below is a market comparison between Quikride and the 4 carshare operators in Vancouver. The first 2 (Evo and Car2go) are floating fleet models just like Quikride where you can pick up and drop off vehicles in their respective home zones. The second 2 (Zipcar and Modo) are station to station models where you pick up and drop off at the same location.</p><p>Take a look at our Quikride vs Evo comparison; if you get into an accident with an Evo car, you are on the hook for the $1000 deductible.

With more than 20 years of experience under our belts, we started to develop HEXAGON in 2014 due to the high rate of road accident induced cycling injuries.<br/> </p><p>Bottom line: we wanted to find a way to increase the safety of cyclists. So, our team thought a lot about solutions for biker safety. After a lot of thought and research, we found a key feature many cycling devices were missing: a rear view camera. Our team collectively decided a rear-view camera would give cyclists more visibility, and therefor confidence on city and road rides. The ability to see behind you was something no other device had done.</p><p> </p><p>From a team of cycling enthusiasts, we hope to change the way your ride for the better.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1489505104/k2hjfvyaunbasd1nkjjh.png"" src=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1489505123/mfi1oqrvwkkquhfzlriy.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1489505134/fcnk1kxcifb71cqnzbit.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>   </p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1489188926/udutsdvgaxdts3klnqfb.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1489514788/qsubljozfwi2czzraeq9.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: center;""> </p><p><strong>What is the difference between the HEXAGON and HEXAGON Light? </strong><br/><br/>The main difference between HEXAGON and HEXAGON Light is HEXAGON is equipped with turn signals.  <br/><br/>The second difference is that the HEXAGON Light doesn’t come with the wireless remote control. Without the wireless remote, you will not be able to take photos during movement and manage the switching on/off the camera. However, HEXAGON Light can be navigated by the HEXAGON app.<br/><br/>The third difference is HEXAGON allows you to add two additional batteries to increase operation time. HEXAGON Light does not allow this.</p><p> </p><p><strong>What’s the quality of HEXAGON and HEXAGON Light’s camera and video footage?</strong><br/><br/>Both models of HEXAGON have a full HD camera with a quality of 1920x1080 or 1080x720 (you set your preferred quality in the camera settings. For smartphone display footage is shown at 640x480 and for live streaming footage is 432x230.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Is it possible to take photos while I’m riding with HEXAGON and HEXAGON Light’s rear-view camera? If so, how do I take still photos?</strong><br/><br/>You can take still photos with HEXAGON, however you cannot with HEXAGON Light.</p><p>HEXAGON’s wireless remote has a special button that allows you to capture high-resolution photos. If you take a photo while you’re live streaming your high-quality photo will be posted to social networks!</p><p> </p><p><strong>What quality are the photos taken with the HEXAGON / HEXAGON Light rear-view camera?</strong> <br/><br/>The quality of photos are 5MP.</p><p> </p><p><strong>I saw you can record straight to an SD card. How long can I record my ride to a 32GB SD card and how does it work?</strong><br/><br/>The maximum file size is 32GB and it will be sufficient for about 3 hours of continuous video recording. This approximately corresponds to the time of operation of the base battery pack.<br/><br/>With increasing operating time, the camera with the same SD card, such as used during a long bike tour, the oldest video files are automatically deleted and new ones are recorded on their place (in a circle), as in a car video recorder.<br/><br/>Approximately 10 minutes before the exhaustion of the working space on the SD card, the system will warn you about this and you can either replace the card and save all videos on your computer, or suspend the camera operation, or allow the system to delete the oldest files and continue recording video files at the vacant place.</p><p> </p><p><strong>How can I copy video files to my computer?</strong><br/><br/>There are three ways to upload your HEXAGON video footage:</p><p> </p><p style=""margin-left:.5in;"">1) Physically transfer the SD card from HEXAGON into your computer and copy the video files to your desktop or laptop</p><p style=""margin-left:.5in;"">2) Connect the HEXAGON micro-USB connector to your desktop or laptop using the cable provided.</p><p style=""margin-left:.5in;"">3) Connect HEXAGON to a computer via a Wi-Fi network.</p><p style=""margin-left:.5in;""> </p><p>In the latter two cases, Hexagon is connected to a computer as an external disk.<br/> </p><p><strong>Are HEXAGON and HEXAGON Light’s traffic signals visible on a bright sunny day? And how far will my lights be visible?</strong><br/><br/>Yes, they are! The motion, turn, and emergency signals are perfectly visible even on a sunny day from a distance of more than 100 meters.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Will the motion signal still be visible if a car has its brights on or if the sun is setting?</strong><br/><br/>HEXAGON's remote control has a smart sensor that control the brightness of HEXAGON’s lights. They continuously monitor the natural illumination of the environment and the brightness of the oncoming traffic. Correspondingly, in a bright counter current flow light, it immediately and proportionally increases the brightness of the corresponding light-emitting diodes.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Can I change Motion light to steady light? In Germany a blinking light is not allowed.</strong></p><p>Yes, you can change and customize the the Motion light function in the ""Settings"" section of HEXAGON's mobile app.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Will the bright light from HEXAGON’s turn signal and stop signal not illuminate the camera and effect my footage?</strong><br/><br/>Nope! HEXAGON is specifically designed for simultaneous and independent operation of the camera and the signals.</p><p> </p><p><strong>How long does the battery last for HEXAGON, HEXAGON Light, and the wireless remote?</strong><br/><br/>You can charge HEXAGON and HEXAGON Light’s batteries through the device’s micro-USB socket by connecting a 5V/1A power supply unit via the supplied micro-USB/USB cable.</p><p>On a full charge, HEXAGON and HEXAGON Light’s will last 3 hours with the camera operating or 12 hours without the camera operating.</p><p>HEXAGON’s remote is powered by a CR2032 battery. A CR2032 battery typically lasts one year.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Is the battery in Hexagon's remote replaceable? </strong></p><p>Yes, HEXAGON’s Remote Control has on the board most commonly used battery CR2032 that can be simply and easily replaced as necessary.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Is the battery in Hexagon replaceable? </strong></p><p>Initially installed rechargeable 18650 batteries (2 pieces) in HEXAGON and HEXAGON Light are not replaceable by ordinary user, but qualified personnel can easily replace it. At the same time, two additional batteries in HEXAGON can be simply and easily installed or replaced as necessary.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Can I extend the operating time of Hexagon/Hexagon Light after a single charge?</strong><br/><br/>You can 2-fold increase the operating time of Hexagon by purchasing and installing 2 additional Hexagon batteries of the 18650 form factor (of the recommended by us types and manufacturers). In this case, the charging time for 4 batteries will be 2-fold increased.<br/><br/>It is impossible to increase the capacity of the battery for the Hexagon Light version.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Can I use my HEXAGON and HEXAGON Light as a Power Bank? </strong><br/><br/>Yes, you can use HEXAGON and HEXAGON Light as a Power Bank!  Using a standard USB cable, you can charge your smartphone or other gadgets when at a halt. Simply detach HEXAGON from its mount and connect your gadget to HEXAGON or HEXAGON Light.</p><p> </p><p><strong>How easy is it to detach HEXAGON and HEXAGON Light?</strong></p><p>Both models can be easily removed with one hand.</p><p> </p><p><strong>What if my HEXAGON / HEXAGON Light stops functioning in the middle of my ride? </strong><br/><br/>First of all, when battery’s charge will be less than 25% from full charge value, you will be informed by special beep sound and message in your Smartphone screen. And you can decide to switch rear camera OFF. In this case, leaving battery’s charge will be able to supply signal lights more than 3 hours of continuous operation.</p><p> </p><p><strong>How do I know, especially in absence of a Smartphone, when the battery charge ends up?</strong><br/><br/>The device will beep!</p><p> </p><p><strong>How will I know if I left my turn or alarm signals enabled?</strong><br/><br/>The device will also beep in these cases.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Will Hexagon use my phone's data if it can't connect to WiFi?</strong></p><p>Yes, HEXAGON and HEXAGON Light will operate using your phone’s data network if permitted.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Is there a mobile app? What are its functions? </strong></p><p>Yes, you can download HEXAGON mobile app for iOS (5 and above) and Android (4 and above). Here are main functions of mobile app:<br/> </p><ul>
<li>Rear View Camera Footage Viewing</li>
<li>Tracking and Navigation</li>
<li>Fitness parameters monitoring</li>
<li>Alert message sending or aborting</li>
<li>Parental control (speed/location/crash or SOS signal)</li>
<li>Social media and other settings</li>
</ul><p> </p><p><strong>Does HEXAGON / HEXAGON Light track me? Where does this data go? </strong></p><p>The HEXAGON mobile app sends your location data to the HEXAGON server and displays the parameters and trajectory of your movement on the map on the screen of your Smartphone.<br/><br/>If you have installed HEXAGON on the bike of your child and if you installed the HEXAGON mobile app, you can set up Parental Control functions on his/her Smartphone and on yours. After this is done, you can track the driving style, the trajectory, and motion parameters of your child on your Smartphone.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Can I connect to other cyclists who are using the HEXAGON app?</strong><br/><br/>Only if an emergency happens. If it is needed, you can press special button on the wireless remote and your SOS message will be sent to appropriate phones, i.e. other cyclists from your Smartphone.<br/><br/>Additionally, you can receive the SOS message from other cyclist if your phone number was entered in appropriate setup menu in his HEXAGON mobile app.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Can I use HEXAGON / HEXAGON Light without my Smartphone?</strong><br/><br/>Yes, you can. In this case, you can use two functions of HEXAGON: switch on and off turn indicators or alarm (parking lights) using buttons of Remote Control, mounted on the handlebars of your bike, and make video recording with the rear view camera on the SD card of HEXAGON by pressing the REC button on a device (you need to set in advance the SD-card into the appropriate slot of devise). In addition, stop and motion signals are working automatically in HEXAGON.<br/><br/>Even if you do not have Remote Control, or it does not work, switched HEXAGON will automatically work out the stop and motion signals and can lead the video recording from the rear view camera with turned on REC button. In addition, in the absence of a Smartphone, we are recommending you to turn off Wi-Fi button on the HEXAGON, to conserve its battery.</p><p> </p><p><strong>I saw HEXAGON has different “modes.” How do HEXAGON's different modes work exactly (i.e. city or highway)?</strong></p><p>By using its own telemetry’s data from embedded gyroscope and accelerometer, HEXAGON clearly controls the Stop and Moving signal lights automatically regardless of the type of track (i.e. city, country or highway).</p><p> </p><p><strong>What is photocell data? I see Hexagon uses this to decide the brightness of my traffic signals. </strong></p><p>Photodiode installed on the front of Remote Control generate the photocell data. The micro controller of Remote Control is in watchdog mode and when photocell data will exceed/downgrade the threshold level, micro controller will wake up and send appropriate telemetry to HEXAGON to increase/decrease the brightness of traffic signals.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Does HEXAGON's motion signal automatically turn on as soon as my bike starts moving? </strong></p><p>HEXAGON’s Moving signal is working permanently. But when you are braking, the Stop signal turns on for 3 seconds. Hereupon the Stop signal turns off and the Moving signal turns on again.</p><p> </p><p><strong>For the Motion Signal, how does HEXAGON know I'm moving? </strong></p><p>HEXAGON knows you’re moving on the base its own telemetry data from embedded gyroscope and accelerometer.</p><p> </p><p><strong>How does HEXAGON / HEXAGON Light mount to my bike? </strong></p><p>HEXAGON and HEXAGON Light both attach to your bike with a complimentary mount-to- frame. The mount is designed so you can easily remove and install HEXAGON!</p><p> </p><p><strong>Will HEXAGON / HEXAGON Light damage my bike?</strong> </p><p>Nope – not at all! Fastening to the frame is so simple and designed so mindfully that there’s no way to damage your bike’s frame.</p><p> </p><p><strong>What is the warranty for HEXAGON and HEXAGON Light?</strong></p><p>We provide a one (1) year limited warranty.</p><p> </p><p><strong>What's your return policy?</strong> </p><p>At observance of operating conditions of HEXAGON, in the case of its failure, you need to send it to our US office with all the other components of the kit (Remote Control, mount, etc.) and we will send you exchange within 2 weeks provided that HEXAGON and other components have no mechanical damages.

With more than 20 years of experience under our belts, we started to develop HEXAGON in 2014 due to the high rate of road accident induced cycling injuries. Bottom line: we wanted to find a way to increase the safety of cyclists. So, our team thought a lot about solutions for biker safety. After a lot of thought and research, we found a key feature many cycling devices were missing: a rear view camera. Our team collectively decided a rear-view camera would give cyclists more visibility, and therefor confidence on city and road rides. The ability to see behind you was something no other device had done. From a team of cycling enthusiasts, we hope to change the way your ride for the better.    What is the difference between the HEXAGON and HEXAGON Light? The main difference between HEXAGON and HEXAGON Light is HEXAGON is equipped with turn signals.  The second difference is that the HEXAGON Light doesn’t come with the wireless remote control. Without the wireless remote, you will not be able to take photos during movement and manage the switching on/off the camera. However, HEXAGON Light can be navigated by the HEXAGON app.The third difference is HEXAGON allows you to add two additional batteries to increase operation time. HEXAGON Light does not allow this. What’s the quality of HEXAGON and HEXAGON Light’s camera and video footage?Both models of HEXAGON have a full HD camera with a quality of 1920x1080 or 1080x720 (you set your preferred quality in the camera settings. For smartphone display footage is shown at 640x480 and for live streaming footage is 432x230. Is it possible to take photos while I’m riding with HEXAGON and HEXAGON Light’s rear-view camera? If so, how do I take still photos?You can take still photos with HEXAGON, however you cannot with HEXAGON Light.HEXAGON’s wireless remote has a special button that allows you to capture high-resolution photos. If you take a photo while you’re live streaming your high-quality photo will be posted to social networks! What quality are the photos taken with the HEXAGON / HEXAGON Light rear-view camera? The quality of photos are 5MP. I saw you can record straight to an SD card. How long can I record my ride to a 32GB SD card and how does it work?The maximum file size is 32GB and it will be sufficient for about 3 hours of continuous video recording. This approximately corresponds to the time of operation of the base battery pack.With increasing operating time, the camera with the same SD card, such as used during a long bike tour, the oldest video files are automatically deleted and new ones are recorded on their place (in a circle), as in a car video recorder.Approximately 10 minutes before the exhaustion of the working space on the SD card, the system will warn you about this and you can either replace the card and save all videos on your computer, or suspend the camera operation, or allow the system to delete the oldest files and continue recording video files at the vacant place. How can I copy video files to my computer?There are three ways to upload your HEXAGON video footage: 1) Physically transfer the SD card from HEXAGON into your computer and copy the video files to your desktop or laptop2) Connect the HEXAGON micro-USB connector to your desktop or laptop using the cable provided.3) Connect HEXAGON to a computer via a Wi-Fi network. In the latter two cases, Hexagon is connected to a computer as an external disk. Are HEXAGON and HEXAGON Light’s traffic signals visible on a bright sunny day? And how far will my lights be visible?Yes, they are! The motion, turn, and emergency signals are perfectly visible even on a sunny day from a distance of more than 100 meters. Will the motion signal still be visible if a car has its brights on or if the sun is setting?HEXAGON's remote control has a smart sensor that control the brightness of HEXAGON’s lights. They continuously monitor the natural illumination of the environment and the brightness of the oncoming traffic. Correspondingly, in a bright counter current flow light, it immediately and proportionally increases the brightness of the corresponding light-emitting diodes. Can I change Motion light to steady light? In Germany a blinking light is not allowed.Yes, you can change and customize the the Motion light function in the ""Settings"" section of HEXAGON's mobile app. Will the bright light from HEXAGON’s turn signal and stop signal not illuminate the camera and effect my footage?Nope! HEXAGON is specifically designed for simultaneous and independent operation of the camera and the signals. How long does the battery last for HEXAGON, HEXAGON Light, and the wireless remote?You can charge HEXAGON and HEXAGON Light’s batteries through the device’s micro-USB socket by connecting a 5V/1A power supply unit via the supplied micro-USB/USB cable.On a full charge, HEXAGON and HEXAGON Light’s will last 3 hours with the camera operating or 12 hours without the camera operating.HEXAGON’s remote is powered by a CR2032 battery. A CR2032 battery typically lasts one year. Is the battery in Hexagon's remote replaceable? Yes, HEXAGON’s Remote Control has on the board most commonly used battery CR2032 that can be simply and easily replaced as necessary. Is the battery in Hexagon replaceable? Initially installed rechargeable 18650 batteries (2 pieces) in HEXAGON and HEXAGON Light are not replaceable by ordinary user, but qualified personnel can easily replace it. At the same time, two additional batteries in HEXAGON can be simply and easily installed or replaced as necessary. Can I extend the operating time of Hexagon/Hexagon Light after a single charge?You can 2-fold increase the operating time of Hexagon by purchasing and installing 2 additional Hexagon batteries of the 18650 form factor (of the recommended by us types and manufacturers). In this case, the charging time for 4 batteries will be 2-fold increased.It is impossible to increase the capacity of the battery for the Hexagon Light version. Can I use my HEXAGON and HEXAGON Light as a Power Bank? Yes, you can use HEXAGON and HEXAGON Light as a Power Bank!  Using a standard USB cable, you can charge your smartphone or other gadgets when at a halt. Simply detach HEXAGON from its mount and connect your gadget to HEXAGON or HEXAGON Light. How easy is it to detach HEXAGON and HEXAGON Light?Both models can be easily removed with one hand. What if my HEXAGON / HEXAGON Light stops functioning in the middle of my ride? First of all, when battery’s charge will be less than 25% from full charge value, you will be informed by special beep sound and message in your Smartphone screen. And you can decide to switch rear camera OFF. In this case, leaving battery’s charge will be able to supply signal lights more than 3 hours of continuous operation. How do I know, especially in absence of a Smartphone, when the battery charge ends up?The device will beep! How will I know if I left my turn or alarm signals enabled?The device will also beep in these cases. Will Hexagon use my phone's data if it can't connect to WiFi?Yes, HEXAGON and HEXAGON Light will operate using your phone’s data network if permitted. Is there a mobile app?

Rear View Camera Footage Viewing
Tracking and Navigation
Fitness parameters monitoring
Alert message sending or aborting

Social media and other settings
 Does HEXAGON / HEXAGON Light track me? Where does this data go? The HEXAGON mobile app sends your location data to the HEXAGON server and displays the parameters and trajectory of your movement on the map on the screen of your Smartphone.If you have installed HEXAGON on the bike of your child and if you installed the HEXAGON mobile app, you can set up Parental Control functions on his/her Smartphone and on yours. After this is done, you can track the driving style, the trajectory, and motion parameters of your child on your Smartphone. Can I connect to other cyclists who are using the HEXAGON app?Only if an emergency happens. If it is needed, you can press special button on the wireless remote and your SOS message will be sent to appropriate phones, i.e. other cyclists from your Smartphone.Additionally, you can receive the SOS message from other cyclist if your phone number was entered in appropriate setup menu in his HEXAGON mobile app. Can I use HEXAGON / HEXAGON Light without my Smartphone?Yes, you can. In this case, you can use two functions of HEXAGON: switch on and off turn indicators or alarm (parking lights) using buttons of Remote Control, mounted on the handlebars of your bike, and make video recording with the rear view camera on the SD card of HEXAGON by pressing the REC button on a device (you need to set in advance the SD-card into the appropriate slot of devise). In addition, stop and motion signals are working automatically in HEXAGON.Even if you do not have Remote Control, or it does not work, switched HEXAGON will automatically work out the stop and motion signals and can lead the video recording from the rear view camera with turned on REC button. In addition, in the absence of a Smartphone, we are recommending you to turn off Wi-Fi button on the HEXAGON, to conserve its battery. I saw HEXAGON has different “modes.” How do HEXAGON's different modes work exactly (i.e. city or highway)?By using its own telemetry’s data from embedded gyroscope and accelerometer, HEXAGON clearly controls the Stop and Moving signal lights automatically regardless of the type of track (i.e. city, country or highway). What is photocell data? I see Hexagon uses this to decide the brightness of my traffic signals. Photodiode installed on the front of Remote Control generate the photocell data. The micro controller of Remote Control is in watchdog mode and when photocell data will exceed/downgrade the threshold level, micro controller will wake up and send appropriate telemetry to HEXAGON to increase/decrease the brightness of traffic signals. Does HEXAGON's motion signal automatically turn on as soon as my bike starts moving? HEXAGON’s Moving signal is working permanently. But when you are braking, the Stop signal turns on for 3 seconds. Hereupon the Stop signal turns off and the Moving signal turns on again. For the Motion Signal, how does HEXAGON know I'm moving? HEXAGON knows you’re moving on the base its own telemetry data from embedded gyroscope and accelerometer. How does HEXAGON / HEXAGON Light mount to my bike? HEXAGON and HEXAGON Light both attach to your bike with a complimentary mount-to- frame. The mount is designed so you can easily remove and install HEXAGON! Will HEXAGON / HEXAGON Light damage my bike? Nope – not at all!

<h3>We Want to Save Lives by Reducing <i>Intextication</i>
</h3>
<p>If you’re brave enough to venture out on the road, you know how many people text and drive on a regular basis. Sometimes, it’s just annoying, when a driver waiting at a light is too busy texting to notice when the light turns green. Other times, it can be deadly. </p>
<blockquote><p>In fact, <b>distracted driving is now the number one cause of fatal crashes</b> in many places; even causing more deaths than drinking and driving.</p></blockquote>
<p><b>Everybody knows texting and driving is bad, but 49% of people under age 35 still do it, and according to a 2012 Ad Council study, 78% of teens and young adults admit to having read an SMS message while driving.</b></p>
<p>Governments all over the world have brought in distracted driving laws to combat the issue, and in most places, they’ve done little to curb the problem. In fact, RCMP Corporal Chris Little was quoted as saying that after 3 years of distracted driving legislation in his home province of Alberta, it’s actually getting worse…</p>
<p><b>Legislation enacted to combat distracted driving in jurisdictions around the world has often proven ineffective at lowering the rates of death and injury.</b> It’s simply too easy to hide your phone while texting and the police can’t be everywhere at once.</p>
<blockquote><p><b>Textattle is a FREE Android application currently under development that helps to provide an added incentive to hang up and drive; the wrath of your mom.</b></p></blockquote>
<p>Here’s how it works. Textattle uses two technologies that are already built into your phone; text messaging and GPS, to tattle on drivers who text at speed.</p>
<p>So, when a driver sends a text to their friend while driving on the highway, their mom, or someone else who loves them, gets a message too. <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; font-style: italic; background-color: initial;""><b>No one wants big brother telling them what to do, but we’re hoping that people will still listen to their mom.</b></span></p>

Legislation enacted to combat distracted driving in jurisdictions around the world has often proven ineffective at lowering the rates of death and injury. It’s simply too easy to hide your phone while texting and the police can’t be everywhere at once.
Textattle is a FREE Android application currently under development that helps to provide an added incentive to hang up and drive; the wrath of your mom.
Here’s how it works. Textattle uses two technologies that are already built into your phone; text messaging and GPS, to tattle on drivers who text at speed.
So, when a driver sends a text to their friend while driving on the highway, their mom, or someone else who loves them, gets a message too. No one wants big brother telling them what to do, but we’re hoping that people will still listen to their mom.

<p style=""text-align: center;"">You would be able to tell the true difference once to get it in your hands!</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">This elaborate procedure with doubled weld seams has two advantages:</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">First, it improves the firmness of the weld seams and minimizes the load peaks on the tube welds through energy flow and on the other hand, it helps the frame to a better and more organic look due to the smooth and hardly noticeable welds.</p>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>The Internal Cables</strong></h3>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">The internally routed cables are not only protected inside of the frame from the dirt, sweat and road grime but also give the bike an organised appearance for your style. This involves several more manufacturing steps but we were more than willing to do it for you! </p>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Detachable battery</h3>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">What is good about Mono? Our <strong>patented</strong> half-hidden-in-the-frame and detachable battery!</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">The battery pack nicely falls down along with the down tube so when you want to charge it, you can easily take the battery out! You can simply knock the key in, detach the battery in one second.  For re-attachment just tuck the battery in to the place where it was! There will be 2 keys given out to you to start with. If you happen to lose the key, contact us for another key set!</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Mono battery harmonizes with the down tube and at the same time, it allows easy access so that you can take it with you anywhere to recharge.</p>

</div><h2 style=""text-align: center;""> </h2><h2 style=""text-align: center;""> </h2><h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3><p> </p><p><strong>Q: What is ""RECON""?</strong></p><p>A: Many of you guys may have heard or seen us at different trade show over the world. Recon HI-TECH is the name of our ebike company that has been upon running for 4 years. We came to create Mono series which superior others design-wise and functionality-wise after several years of developing all kinds of models from city ebikes to eMTBs. </p><p> </p><p><strong>Q: How is ""Mono"" crafted?</strong></p><p>A: Our design team in conjunction with our engineers created RECON's own frame that you can't find anywhere else. This is how we came across with the name of ""Mono"" which implies its ""uniqueness"". Along with Mono, we wanted you to be ""the one"" who follows the simple and modern life style. </p><p>At the top of this design, we found a way to put a battery that can be be easily detachable for your convenience.</p><p> We added both of PAS (Pedal Assist System) AND a throttle, so that you can choose whichever to fulfill your needs.  We market-tested our Mono series locally in Korea and upgraded with the features that overseas users might prefer, such as a LCD indicator in mileage. With your support, we would be able to precede the final production phase for you! </p><p> </p><p><strong>Q: What are the differences among Mono 20, Mono 26 and Mono 20 FAT?</strong></p><p>A: Firstly, they differ in the size of the wheel. The number indicates its wheel size in inches.</p><p>Our Mono 20 is designed for everyone to easily hope on. Anyone taller than 5.15 ft would have no trouble riding our Mono 20.</p><p>Mono 26 is for everyone but might be preferred who are taller than 5.75 foot because it frame is designed to be higher than Mono 20.</p><p>Mono 20 FAT is for everyone who are more sporty, riding Mono in slippery, snowy and sandy environment.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Q: Is the brake system safe?</strong></p><p>A: For riders safety, Mono series is built with a disc brake system which differs from the rim brakes. While rim brakes get easily heated up, cause the tires to wear and become weak on the wet surfaces, the disc brakes can endure the tougher riding conditions and after the long term use, you can simply replace the disc brake rotors rather than having to change the whole set.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Q: What are PAS and throttle functions?</strong></p><p>A: There are two distinctive electric functions. One called PAS; pedal assist system, the other a throttle.</p><p>If you want to ride Mono just like normal bicycles, you can do so with the PAS level 0 while still being able to check the current speed, distance traveled, battery gauge, integrated lights and etc.</p><p>For PAS system, you will be getting extra help from the motor WHILE pedaling by clicking the up and down buttons near the left handle bar grip. There are 6 different levels from 0 to 5.  0 being just like normal bicycles with no help from the motor at all. Higher the level gets, stronger the power you will be getting.</p><p>Throttle, is something you would want to use when you want to cruise without pedaling and ride it like a motorbike. Just twist the thumb throttle near the right side of the handle bar.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Q: How is the effective exercise possible with Mono?</strong></p><p>A: To start with, you can ride Mono just like a non-ebike for exercising while being able to check the current speed, distance traveled and whenever you are frustrated, you can get help from the motor and ride further distance at steady exercise level for effective aerobic exercise. Aerobic exercise, as you might have already know, burns up calories which can in turn help you shed excess weight and be healthier! </p><p>I guarantee, you will go outside, ride Mono and utilize it more often in your everyday life for your transportation and health because you have less stress about having to do a hard out leg work.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Q: How does the battery get recharged? Does it self-recharge?</strong></p><p>A: Mono battery is half hidden in the frame. You can simply detach it in a matter of a second and plug it on the wall to recharge it. It does not provide any self-recharging function because it is just not cost-effective to have it integrated and it only causes the resistance back to itself which will again takes more energy to push further.</p><h3> </h3><p><strong>Q: How long does it take to fully recharge the battery?</strong></p><p>A: For Mono 20 and Mono 26, it takes approximately 4 hours. For Mono FAT, approximately 4.5~5 hours. With our fast charger, it will only take around 2.5 hours to fully recharge!</p><p> </p><p><strong>Q: How long is the battery lifespan?</strong></p><p>A: Normally, the lithium ion battery lifespan will be decreased to around 80% after 800 cycles.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Q: The battery is exposed to the outside. Does it come with water-resistance features?</strong></p><p>A: Yes. It is half hidden, meaning it is also half-exposed for the ease of detachment and recharging. It would be OK to ride on rainy days, but it is recommended to make sure you wipe the wet surface with dry towel for storage after the use.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Q: Would it be possible to purchase a spare battery?</strong></p><p>A: Yes. Of course! You can get ""a spare battery perk"" for yourself. If you need another pack after the campaign, you would always be able get it from us directly and you will need to as Mono batteries are specialized for Mono only. I recommend getting it NOW to save your money and shipping costs!</p><p> </p><p><strong>Q: What would be the range (distance covered with a single charge)?</strong></p><p>A: In PAS level 1 with pedaling, it can cover the estimated range of 50 miles (80km) and when throttle is in use (full electric), the estimated range is 15.5 MPH (25km). The range may be differ depending on the geography of riding, weight of the rider and other factors.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Q: How fast is it?</strong></p><p>A: In PAS(pedal assist system) mode with Mono 20 and Mono 26 (8.8Ah batteries) , you can reach the maximum speed of 21.7MPH (35KMH) and in throttle mode, 12.5MPH (20KMH). However, there will be the speed limit programmed to meet the regulations of 20 MPH (32KMH). You can reprogram it to follow your country regulations. </p><p>Mono FAT (10.4Ah battery) can reach the maximum speed of 27.9MPH (45KMH) in PAS mode and 18.5MPH (30KMH) when throttle is in use. So, please check if Mono FAT with 500W is allowed in your regions before backing us!</p><p> </p><p><strong>Q: What can I do when battery goes flat while riding?</strong></p><p>A: Do not panic. You can simply ride it like regular bicycles by pedaling or find a power supplier to recharge your battery. Alternately, you can get a perk for a spare battery which is only 6 pounds (2.8kg) approximately. Then you will be ready to boost for another round in one second!</p><p> </p><p><strong>Q: Is it safe to use?</strong></p><p>A: Yes. There is BMS circuit that controls the battery and prevents it from the over-current and over-voltage for your safety. If there is something wrong electronically, there will be an error code appearing on the LCD screen in 2 digits number.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Q: How to read error codes?</strong></p><p>A: The errors codes are the key for the communication and identifying the problems caused electronically. Please follow the chart to figure out what is an issue.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1489538758/qafumux4z7y05k0yypdj.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p> </p><p><strong>Q: What happens if the campaign does not reach the goal?</strong></p><p>A: Don't worry! We will still keep the promise and send you the perks to your door!</p><p> </p><p><strong>Q: How does the perk come to my door?</strong></p><p>A: Everything will come in one box. There will be a mini tooling set for you to get your bike ready for a ride as well as the instructions on how to screw to pedals, handle bar and the front wheel for the completion!</p><p> </p><p><strong>Q: What about the part for replacements?</strong></p><p>A: You can always get all the components from us. However, apart from the battery and the key set, the parts are standard so you can get it from the local bike shop for repair, upgrades and customization. </p><p> </p><p><strong>Q: What is the maximum load?</strong></p><p>A: The Maximum load is approximately 265 pounds. It is made of aluminium alloy which is the most widely used material for bike frame and well known for its strength and safety.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Q: Do I need a license to ride MONO?</strong></p><p>A: Yes for US and no for EU.

Constructing the blueprint after 3D rendering simulation.



Smooth Welding
Mono used smooth welding procedure for the most visible parts for sharper look!
You would be able to tell the true difference once to get it in your hands!
This elaborate procedure with doubled weld seams has two advantages:
First, it improves the firmness of the weld seams and minimizes the load peaks on the tube welds through energy flow and on the other hand, it helps the frame to a better and more organic look due to the smooth and hardly noticeable welds.

The Internal Cables
The internally routed cables are not only protected inside of the frame from the dirt, sweat and road grime but also give the bike an organised appearance for your style. This involves several more manufacturing steps but we were more than willing to do it for you! 



INTEGRATED front and back lights

Be smart and have the lights integrated! They keep you safe during the night ride and make your bike looking nice and neat during the day. You can avoid having the bulky head and rear lights being attached on the frame, too! Just press the 'PAS level up' button longer for switching on and off! How simple!


Detachable battery
What is good about Mono? Our patented half-hidden-in-the-frame and detachable battery!
The battery pack nicely falls down along with the down tube so when you want to charge it, you can easily take the battery out! You can simply knock the key in, detach the battery in one second.  For re-attachment just tuck the battery in to the place where it was! There will be 2 keys given out to you to start with. If you happen to lose the key, contact us for another key set!
Mono battery harmonizes with the down tube and at the same time, it allows easy access so that you can take it with you anywhere to recharge.
There is a little button on the battery pack for you to press and see the battery gauge. So you will be able to constantly check how much is left to go without turning the screen on each time.



Let's have a closer look at the difference between tires.
In the video, you can our Mono 20 FAT(left) and Mono 20(right).
Mono 20 has 20""x1.75 KENDA tires for convenient city riding and Mono 20 FAT is equipped with 20""x4.0 CST tires for the steady riding in tougher conditions. eg slippery, snowy and etc.
Please NOTE : Mono FAT in the video has KENDA tires but the actual product delivered to you will be the one from CST. Mono 26 has 20""x1.75 KENDA tires.


 

LCD screen
LCD indicates the battery gauge, current speed (You can set in MPH or KMH), the PAS levels (from 0-5), whether the integrated lights are on or off and the total distance traveled. It also tell you the error code when something goes wrong and this can be the communication key between you and our engineers! eg. error code : 22 - throttle problem and etc.
 

Please note : the basic LCD set is provided as the above.
 

Adjustable to YOU
Our Mono series is adjustable. You can not only adjust the height of the seat but also the height of the handle! Each ring is about 0.4 inch (1cm) and there are 4~6 rings depending on the models to take out. It is not difficult to do it at home but if you do not have any tools, just visit your nearest bike shop for help!

MONO 20 Front Suspension
Our Mono 20 is even more special.  It has a front suspension which absorbs physical shocks applied the front wheel for easier riding on uphills, rough surfaces and pebbles.

  Frequently Asked Questions Q: What is ""RECON""?A: Many of you guys may have heard or seen us at different trade show over the world. Recon HI-TECH is the name of our ebike company that has been upon running for 4 years. We came to create Mono series which superior others design-wise and functionality-wise after several years of developing all kinds of models from city ebikes to eMTBs.  Q: How is ""Mono"" crafted?A: Our design team in conjunction with our engineers created RECON's own frame that you can't find anywhere else. This is how we came across with the name of ""Mono"" which implies its ""uniqueness"". Along with Mono, we wanted you to be ""the one"" who follows the simple and modern life style. At the top of this design, we found a way to put a battery that can be be easily detachable for your convenience. We added both of PAS (Pedal Assist System) AND a throttle, so that you can choose whichever to fulfill your needs.  We market-tested our Mono series locally in Korea and upgraded with the features that overseas users might prefer, such as a LCD indicator in mileage. With your support, we would be able to precede the final production phase for you!  Q: What are the differences among Mono 20, Mono 26 and Mono 20 FAT?A: Firstly, they differ in the size of the wheel. The number indicates its wheel size in inches.Our Mono 20 is designed for everyone to easily hope on. Anyone taller than 5.15 ft would have no trouble riding our Mono 20.Mono 26 is for everyone but might be preferred who are taller than 5.75 foot because it frame is designed to be higher than Mono 20.Mono 20 FAT is for everyone who are more sporty, riding Mono in slippery, snowy and sandy environment. Q: Is the brake system safe?A: For riders safety, Mono series is built with a disc brake system which differs from the rim brakes. While rim brakes get easily heated up, cause the tires to wear and become weak on the wet surfaces, the disc brakes can endure the tougher riding conditions and after the long term use, you can simply replace the disc brake rotors rather than having to change the whole set. Q: What are PAS and throttle functions?A: There are two distinctive electric functions. One called PAS; pedal assist system, the other a throttle.If you want to ride Mono just like normal bicycles, you can do so with the PAS level 0 while still being able to check the current speed, distance traveled, battery gauge, integrated lights and etc.For PAS system, you will be getting extra help from the motor WHILE pedaling by clicking the up and down buttons near the left handle bar grip. There are 6 different levels from 0 to 5.  0 being just like normal bicycles with no help from the motor at all. Higher the level gets, stronger the power you will be getting.Throttle, is something you would want to use when you want to cruise without pedaling and ride it like a motorbike. Just twist the thumb throttle near the right side of the handle bar. Q: How is the effective exercise possible with Mono?A: To start with, you can ride Mono just like a non-ebike for exercising while being able to check the current speed, distance traveled and whenever you are frustrated, you can get help from the motor and ride further distance at steady exercise level for effective aerobic exercise. Aerobic exercise, as you might have already know, burns up calories which can in turn help you shed excess weight and be healthier! I guarantee, you will go outside, ride Mono and utilize it more often in your everyday life for your transportation and health because you have less stress about having to do a hard out leg work. Q: How does the battery get recharged? Does it self-recharge?A: Mono battery is half hidden in the frame. You can simply detach it in a matter of a second and plug it on the wall to recharge it. It does not provide any self-recharging function because it is just not cost-effective to have it integrated and it only causes the resistance back to itself which will again takes more energy to push further. Q: How long does it take to fully recharge the battery?A: For Mono 20 and Mono 26, it takes approximately 4 hours. For Mono FAT, approximately 4.5~5 hours. With our fast charger, it will only take around 2.5 hours to fully recharge! Q: How long is the battery lifespan?A: Normally, the lithium ion battery lifespan will be decreased to around 80% after 800 cycles. Q: The battery is exposed to the outside. Does it come with water-resistance features?A: Yes. It is half hidden, meaning it is also half-exposed for the ease of detachment and recharging. It would be OK to ride on rainy days, but it is recommended to make sure you wipe the wet surface with dry towel for storage after the use. Q: Would it be possible to purchase a spare battery?A: Yes. Of course! You can get ""a spare battery perk"" for yourself. If you need another pack after the campaign, you would always be able get it from us directly and you will need to as Mono batteries are specialized for Mono only. I recommend getting it NOW to save your money and shipping costs! Q: What would be the range (distance covered with a single charge)?A: In PAS level 1 with pedaling, it can cover the estimated range of 50 miles (80km) and when throttle is in use (full electric), the estimated range is 15.5 MPH (25km). The range may be differ depending on the geography of riding, weight of the rider and other factors. Q: How fast is it?A: In PAS(pedal assist system) mode with Mono 20 and Mono 26 (8.8Ah batteries) , you can reach the maximum speed of 21.7MPH (35KMH) and in throttle mode, 12.5MPH (20KMH). However, there will be the speed limit programmed to meet the regulations of 20 MPH (32KMH). You can reprogram it to follow your country regulations. Mono FAT (10.4Ah battery) can reach the maximum speed of 27.9MPH (45KMH) in PAS mode and 18.5MPH (30KMH) when throttle is in use. So, please check if Mono FAT with 500W is allowed in your regions before backing us! Q: What can I do when battery goes flat while riding?A: Do not panic. You can simply ride it like regular bicycles by pedaling or find a power supplier to recharge your battery. Alternately, you can get a perk for a spare battery which is only 6 pounds (2.8kg) approximately. Then you will be ready to boost for another round in one second! Q: Is it safe to use?A: Yes. There is BMS circuit that controls the battery and prevents it from the over-current and over-voltage for your safety. If there is something wrong electronically, there will be an error code appearing on the LCD screen in 2 digits number. Q: How to read error codes?A: The errors codes are the key for the communication and identifying the problems caused electronically. Please follow the chart to figure out what is an issue. Q: What happens if the campaign does not reach the goal?A: Don't worry! We will still keep the promise and send you the perks to your door! Q: How does the perk come to my door?A: Everything will come in one box. There will be a mini tooling set for you to get your bike ready for a ride as well as the instructions on how to screw to pedals, handle bar and the front wheel for the completion! Q: What about the part for replacements?A: You can always get all the components from us. However, apart from the battery and the key set, the parts are standard so you can get it from the local bike shop for repair, upgrades and customization.  Q: What is the maximum load?A: The Maximum load is approximately 265 pounds. It is made of aluminium alloy which is the most widely used material for bike frame and well known for its strength and safety. Q: Do I need a license to ride MONO?A: Yes for US and no for EU. Our Mono 20 an Mono 26 are equipped with 350W following the US regulations and Mono 20 FAT with 500W for some regions. You can check the regulations according to your state at here.  This is the reason why we do not delivery the perks to Europe countries but to US, Canada, Korea and China. Our Mono series has the capacity of riding at the maximum speed given at the above chart but will have the limits set up to 20mph (32km/h) which is adjustable with reprogramming.  Q: I live in Europe and want Mono series. What do I do?A: RECON is working in conjunction with SPINE from Italy for launching Mono 20 and Mono 26 with SPINE's application technology in several months. Please contact info@spinebike.com for more information. Q: Who is responsible for TAX, DUTY and VAT?A: It is 0% in US and Korea. Please check with your customs and government or contact us. Q: How to contact us?A: You can either email us to iris@reconbike.com or call +1-213.295.3330 / +82-70-4261-7553.",51.0,4,"1 Campaign

<blockquote><b>That's all the mechanical parts, 20kw power-30kg weight</b></blockquote>
<br/>
<p><b>Last and most important factor though is weight, as in city driving speeds specially weight dictates the amount of energy an object needs to cover distances.</b></p>
<p><b>That’s something that needs attention as long as modern cars tend to go heavier and heavier and that is also the reason we looked for the lightest candidates.</b></p>
<p><b>We need to stay in budget and build a car that has the weight of a custom-made carbon monocoque project worthing hundreds thousands of dollars.</b></p>
<p><b>To do that we know we have to sacrifice our aerodynamic drag and just use an old light donor car removing as much weight as possible under budget.</b></p>
<p><b>We calculate that in city driving,slow speeds will counterbalace for the raised drag and save as from building a whole new body for the project.</b></p>
<p><b>At last we decided to use a VW beetle,a very simple and light donor car that can accomodate enough solar cells for the project!</b></p>
<p><b>That way we dont have to put much effort,sources and time to build a custom lightweight  body.</b></p>
<p><b>This little car using aftermarket parts and exotic materials can get lighter than 450 kg fully converted and has all the potential to be a classy ultra-tech solar car that works great for our project.</b></p>

<h2>Risks and challenges</h2>

Its time to demonstrate that oil-free and grid-free transportation is here and looks good!






It's simple.

You park it around the block and it charges from the solar array, enough to take you to work and around town everyday.
If you need to drive an extra distance, you have you an extra power reserve,but now you have to top it up in small doses the folowing days.
Its all calculated that you don't ever have to plug it on grid.
That's the target.
That way you are energy sufficient.
Now you can drive your daily route all year long with no ''fuel''.
Propably you can't take big trips yet, but for now, town commuting is free.
It's possible.
Five years back it was unreachable.
Two years back it was furiously expensive.
Now we can make it happen!
We can do it.
The key factor is efficiency.
Only the top-end materials and technologies matched together can give the wanted result.

We will use record breaking sollar cells of 24.5% efficiency that are already available on the market!
We will match them with titanate-lithium cells that offer unbelievable charging-discharging and kw/kg rates
We will drive the vehicle with 97-98% efficiency motor-controller compo.


We are ready to share our passion!



A whole new aspect of self-sufficient vehicles that need nothing but a parking space to get you to work every day.




Even the small daily range of 50km  should not be underestimated as it will prove in real-time that energy-free transportation can happen.


After all, most of us drive smaller distances than that to go to work and around town every day.
But why bother building a Solar Electric car?
Firstly because we love electric vehicles.
From bicycles to small trikes and light aircrafts and cars we are constantly building projects like that for fun.
Our expertise and working field is on power electronics and batteries we have an engineer in the group and a carbon fiber laminator as well!
A bunch of tech-lovers that put everything on the table and push theirselfes to find new possible answers.
What motivates as, is the fact that scientific and technological resources are finally ready  to trigger a revolution in transportation.
Modern cars are well built for their purpose, but urban and city traffic makes them bulky and expensive to use when compared to public transportation.
In the era of electric formula cars and publicly available technology we decided that we can be part of those to explore and overcome every obstacle on the way to energy sufficient solar vehicles.




How will we do that?
We targeted to use an electric configuration that reaches the highest efficiencies on the market to get the most out of the battery bank.
Most of the parts on the project are available on the market and match perfect with new battery chemistries to deliver power to weight ratios suitable even for ultralight aircrafts.
We want to prove that even a very small budget can make revolutionary difference in everyday life.

All that paired with
extremely well balanced perfomance specs that mean calculated acceleration
forces and high regenerative braking get the project literally ahead.



That's all the mechanical parts, 20kw power-30kg weight

Last and most important factor though is weight, as in city driving speeds specially weight dictates the amount of energy an object needs to cover distances.
That’s something that needs attention as long as modern cars tend to go heavier and heavier and that is also the reason we looked for the lightest candidates.
We need to stay in budget and build a car that has the weight of a custom-made carbon monocoque project worthing hundreds thousands of dollars.
To do that we know we have to sacrifice our aerodynamic drag and just use an old light donor car removing as much weight as possible under budget.
We calculate that in city driving,slow speeds will counterbalace for the raised drag and save as from building a whole new body for the project.
At last we decided to use a VW beetle,a very simple and light donor car that can accomodate enough solar cells for the project!
That way we dont have to put much effort,sources and time to build a custom lightweight  body.
This little car using aftermarket parts and exotic materials can get lighter than 450 kg fully converted and has all the potential to be a classy ultra-tech solar car that works great for our project.




Finally
what makes the project unique is the solar array.






It sounds easy to build a light electric car top it with sollar cells and drive around.

That's not the case.
Until new materials arrived, it was simple to calculate that a car should be ridiculously big and wide to match its needs for energy and be sufficient.
Only in the last year, record breaking cells came to market for public use,cells that almost double the energy per square meter!





We purchased and tested maxeon c60 cells wich are flexible and can be put on the panels of the car.

We know we can do it, just by watching Solar Impulse travelling the world with the same solar cells batteries and motor type!





  




Risks and challenges
Our target goal is to build a daily driving vehicle that covers its energy needs on solar energy. We set the value of 50km as our first threshold based on available technology today,our funds and also on estimated daily needs, as we calculated that a big part of daily transportation needs are covered for most of the people with less than 50 km range.
We are targeting for a vehicle usefull even for cloudy days or some bigger distances. 
Cloudy days can give enough solar energy for a part of the range but the battery bank will be enough for more than 200km distance. 
That way the user will not have to worry at all about weather changes or some bigger trips as long ,daily needs are in the 50km range.
So if you cover daily,for instance 40km,you can each saturday have a 110km trip and have it all charged up until the next saturday or have 200km trip each 15 days etc.
All our calculations based on our experience in smaller electric vehicles and solar energy knowledge ,makes us confident that even if unknown to that pioneering project variants get in the way,that will only affect the final range of the vehicle to a small point.
The fact that a small funded,normal looking classic car would be able to travel distances and cover daily transportation needs in a big city producing its own energy from the sun,for us already looks a big success.
Our planning to this point concludes all numbers data,parts pricing and assets and we are confident that the project will be exactly what we are waiting for.Full of experiences and our first step to this new level of technological revolution",17.0,0,"1 Campaign

In engine tests we discovered that:</p><ul>
<li>Fuel economy performance increased by 6-8% in a car with 130K+ miles while increasing in-cylinder compression.</li>
<li>As the nice round cylinders wear in your engine, they become more elliptical which decreases engine performance. TriboTEX forms a film on the worn parts of the cylinder making it rounder and increasing compression. Essentially the engine repairs itself as the coating goes to work. </li>
<li>Engine noise drops dramatically. On idle your engine noise will be so low, your neighbors may not even hear your car in the morning :-) and your mechanic will hear your injectors as the dominant source of a noise.</li>
<li>Easily adds 3%+ more power under your hood without disassembly.</li>
<li>Your engine will run cooler which increases the life of gaskets, seals, and bearing surfaces.</li>

Without giving your car a second thought, you drive off...Halfway to work the ""Check Engine"" light blinks on and a thick cloud of smoke billows out of your tail pipe into traffic.You're now living through an invisible, multi-billion dollar problem faced by drivers worldwide. A problem that big oil companies want you to ignore...Average gas mileage for new passenger cars has stagnated around 22 MPG for the last 20 years. Traditional engines only deliver a 30% tank-to-wheel efficiency at best.Cars are generally discarded after 153,000  miles (NHTSA) due to the stress and heat caused by friction inside the engine, which leads to lost compression and efficiency. Engines wear out quickly and cost thousands to repair when something eventually breaks.Millions of cars end up in landfills every year as they wear out and become too costly to maintain. Toxic heavy metals, oils, and other chemicals end up in our storm drains and water supplies when once loved cars end up as waste.Solution TriboTEX stands at the forefront of a huge revolution in tiny nanoparticles. We’ll show you how TriboTEX can improve your engine in 15 minutes, but first let’s look at the technology behind it...It’s like the ceramic protective coatings used in some high-performance engines, but it reduces friction 10X BETTER than engine oil alone. In engine tests we discovered that:
Fuel economy performance increased by 6-8% in a car with 130K+ miles while increasing in-cylinder compression.
As the nice round cylinders wear in your engine, they become more elliptical which decreases engine performance. TriboTEX forms a film on the worn parts of the cylinder making it rounder and increasing compression. Essentially the engine repairs itself as the coating goes to work. 
Engine noise drops dramatically. On idle your engine noise will be so low, your neighbors may not even hear your car in the morning :-) and your mechanic will hear your injectors as the dominant source of a noise.
Easily adds 3%+ more power under your hood without disassembly.
Your engine will run cooler which increases the life of gaskets, seals, and bearing surfaces.
What TriboTEX doesn’t do is just as important. TriboTEX won’t... 
Ruin your catalytic converter on newer cars like other oil additives (ZDDP) 
Pollute the environment because all TriboTEX ingredients are environmentally friendly 
Leave you wondering “if it’s working”. You’ll feel & hear it as soon as 15 minutes after application, due to the coating affecting the journal bearings. The performance boost will come later when your cylinders get coated.
We’ve been awarded over $1,000,000 in grants from the National Science Foundation and other agencies to conduct research and make our material in large production quantities. Now we need you to bring TriboTEX to life in your vehicle.We're ready to reveal TriboTEX to YOU, our first customers! 
Take your car out for a drive to warm the engine up. You want to make sure your engine is warm before applying TriboTEX.
Open your oil filler cap and squeeze all 20 ml of the proprietary nanomaterial into your engine or oil tank. Idle the engine for 15 minutes to allow the engine oil to mix with TriboTEX. After putting another 500 miles on your car (about 2 full tanks), your gas mileage will experience the full effect of TriboTEX at work.Apply another coating of TriboTEX AFTER driving another 40,000 miles. Yes, it lasts that long! One syringe is enough to treat 3-8 quarts of oil. Just add extra applications if your car or truck takes more oil. What We’ve Achieved Up To NowBy backing our campaign, you will be one of the first people in the world to experience how nanotechnology is changing the way people drive. TriboTEX has been in hundreds of lab tests and in live on-the-road tests with dozens of our friends' cars.

</ul><p> </p><p> </p></div>","The Audio Control Alert System (ACS) is an emergency siren detector for automobile use that is designed to control the media audio and alert occupants of approaching emergency vehicles for safety measures upon detection.  Focusing on providing greater situational awareness when it matters most,  the ACS alerts the driver to take prompt actions (yield, slow down, pull over, etc.) which are crucial to collision prevention.  Implementation is based on utilizing a modern microprocessor to perform audio processing to filter specific sequence of tones and frequencies of surrounding sound.  A perfect solution to be implemented onto the onboard computer of new generational automobiles equipped with ANC or as a standalone embedded system.Accidents involving emergency vehicles such as fire trucks, ambulances, and police cars are a substantial problem in the United States.  Vehicle fatality rates for emergency responders are estimated to be up to 4.8 times higher than the national average. Most emergency vehicle accidents occur at intersection. Because emergency vehicles are typically traveling at higher speeds in urgent situations, the accidents often result in severe injury or death to occupants of the emergency vehicle or the passenger vehicle involved.Below are some statistics regarding emergency vehicle accidents illustrating how large the problem is in the U.S.Ambulance Accidents in the U.S.The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) released a report in April of 2014 that provides an overview of the number of ambulance accidents in the United States. The agency studied the number of ambulance accidents over a 20 year period from 1992-2011.Below are some of the key findings from the report:
Over the 20 year period, there were an estimated 4,500 accidents involving ambulances each year.
35% of accidents resulted in injury or fatality to at least 1 occupant of a vehicle involved.
An average of 29 fatal ambulance accidents produced 33 fatalities each year.
On average, 2,600 people are injured in 1,500 ambulance accidents each year.
Of those killed in an ambulance accident, 63% were occupants of a passenger vehicle, 21% were passengers in the ambulance, and 4% were the ambulance driver.
Firetruck Accidents in the U.S.According to data from the NHTSA and the United States Fire Administration (USFA), firetruck accidents are the second leading cause of on-the-job deaths for firefighters.Below are some key findings from an analysis of NHTSA data on firetruck accidents from 2000-2009:
Over that 10 year period, there were roughly 31,600 accidents involving fire vehicles.
Rollovers account for 66% of all fatal firetruck accidents.
Police Car Accidents in the U.S.Using data from 1994-2002, researchers from the University of Washington performed an analysis of the number of fatalities each year that occur during police pursuits.Below are some of their key findings:
Each year there are approximately 300 fatalities in the U.S. that occur during police pursuits.
Just over 30% of the fatalities occurred to people who were not involved in the pursuit.
Emergency responders perform an honorable and important job, but they still have a duty to respond to emergencies as safely as possible. Accidents involving emergency vehicles occur far too often in our country and many, if not most, of them are avoidable.  Imagine if you or a love one got injured or killed in an accident with an ambulance, firetruck, police car, or other emergency vehicle that could have been prevented if such device was implemented to alert you ahead of time.TBAProlific Circuits, specializes in embedded system designs and development.

<p><b>Who are the masterminds behind Troja Bike? </b></p>
<p>In 2012, brothers Marek and Adrian Rauko began to explore their idea of ​​developing their own GPS tracking system. </p>
<p>Adrian was active as a private investigator for many years. Let down by unreliable locating devices, he decided to take matters into his own hands and to finally develop a device that met his specific needs. </p>
<p>Marek, a trained electrical engineer and IT manager, embraced the idea and joined his brother in the development of the new device.

<p>Introducing the world’s first
tri-suspension bike, the TECHNOTREON ALPHA. 
We proudly claim that there does not exist a bike to match its stability
or comfort anywhere close to its offered price. 
And to add another exquisite feature, we made it theft-resistant so that
you experience the freedom of riding into unchartered territories your way. It
has a revolutionary in-frame lighting system which makes it practically
impossible to steal your headlights and sabotage your night riding safety.  Every person on Earth is unique or this is
what we like to believe. So why can’t his objects of such importance be as
unique as him/her. Unfortunately we cannot do anything about your phone or your
car but what we could do is offer you the ability to reinvent your bike….your
way. Technotreon Alpha boasts of LIMITLESS customization.  Your Alpha can be made to reflect you in
every way possible. Custom paint job, unique name printing, customized decals,
favorite automotive inspired vinyls or special bike type transformation
customization. You name it. If you can imagine it, we can do it. There is nothing
we can’t display on your very own unique Alpha. Experience bike riding in a way
you never really did.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1459209295/cikoxschhcf4uhl7yicw.jpg"" src="""" style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;""/><br/></p>
<h3></h3>
<p>The patented design of Technotreon Alpha is definitely the most unique in the world. For all intents and purposes the design consists of two individual unique components, the wheel tri-suspension and the in-frame suspension.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1459209516/ouahihysu2gvucbrnwbw.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<h1>                     WHEELS</h1>
<p></p>
<p> Its revolutionary wheels are the next level of technology since the invention of the ‘hub less wheels’ in the 1980s. A single wheel consists of three shock absorbers positioned at such an angle that they preserve and conserve momentum, increase propulsive efficiency and effectively act as the WORLD’s most advanced suspension system not just in the biking industry but in the entire transportation technology. There is no explanation required about the benefits of this tech in offroading in any kind of terrain (we tend to include grass, mud, sand, gravel, dunes and semi flood in our definition!) but little did we at Technotreon anticipate that they work exceptionally good even in urban commuting and cruising at high speeds. The angle formed by the suspension system makes the wheels very efficient during high speeds and hence increase stability and comfort which is seldom found in retail bikes and only exist in custom racing cycles. Hence we are proud to present an all-terrain biking experience.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1459209880/cqdq8o3oziwygfqbldbe.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<h1>                      FRAME</h1>
<p></p>
<p>This feature of the Technotreon Alpha is particularly awesome, simply because it takes frame suspension to a whole new level. It would be a gross understatement to say that this is a better frame suspension than any other bike has to offer in the entire world.  What it actually does is convert not just your rear wheel into a shock absorber but transforms the entire lower length of your bike into a retracting compressing spring. And when added with our patent pending wheels, this effectively transforms your Technotreon Alpha into a rolling cushion. The shock absorber is located vertically in the center and with its axle uniquely positioned over the front fork, makes the bike an invincible suspension vehicle which is way apart from what the biking industry has ever seen.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1459210174/n0lb3vuoflvgnjwwwsuf.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<h1>                     DESIGN</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Every person has the right to stand out. The Technotreon Alpha cannot help you in your job but it can definitely make you look different while riding. It has been designed in such a way that it tends to stand apart. We increased the length of the frame by 15% as compared to standard bikes and decreased the height by 10% to improve its aerodynamic capabilities and thereby increase its speed and decrease your effort. Also it is adaptable to any electric bike module just in case you want to motorize your beloved Alpha. And this does not end here, there are a lot of bike thieves these days and we know how painful it is to lose such a beloved possession. That is why we designed it to be ANTI-THEFT. Yes, you are a fantastic reader and you read it right! Having a theft-resistant bike is a bare necessity during such times. And your beloved beauty will have all of the adequate features to keep conspiring thieves at bay. It will have custom wheel bolts with supplied attachment so that only you could access the wheels. The rest of the bike is design welded and custom fitted to serve you for years to come without ever being stolen.<br/></p>

<p></p>
<p></p>
<h1>                  BIKE SIZE</h1>
<p></p>
<p>We want you to be as comfortable as possible during your leisure time or your commute. This means that your bike should be a perfect fit for you. Due to the unique frame design of our Technotreon Alpha we could cater to heights beginning from 135cm (53”) to 195cm (78”) which is by far one of the best height ranges any bike has to offer. </p>

<p></p>
<h1>       ELECTRONIC LIGHTING</h1>
<p>Technotreon Alpha has the best
lighting system ever. Not only because it is powered by a massive 2.5 Ampere
battery which could go on for weeks with standard night usage or because it has
USB ports located under its seat and optional ports on the handle bar but
because it’s the only real anti-theft light in the market.  We absolutely guarantee the safety of your
headlights. Technotreon Alpha has first-of-its-kind IN-FRAME lighting
technology which basically means that the lights are permanently welded in your
bike and cannot be stolen. With most of the wiring through the frame, the only
way to steal its lights is by slicing the handlebar itself with an angle
grinder. (The thief is in for a lot of work!). The headlight can be tuned for
urban or cross country night riding at the push of a button.  Also your Alpha has specifically designed LED
turn signals with the most comfortable triggers ever. Each side trigger is
located on the respective side of the handlebar which is the first time a bike is
utilizing this obvious feature. This drastically improves accessibility and shortens
the reaction time ultimately leading to upgraded safety.</p>

<h1>            APP DEVELOPMENT</h1>
</div>
<div>Along
with the numerous features of the Technotreon Alpha, we also cater to the
thirst of Techies and fitness freaks with in-development app. We have a
dedicated professional software developing team working to make your ride as
easy and interactive as web browsing! The app is expected to offer your ride
stats such as speed, time and distance while also recording further stats such
as calories burned with respect to the selected gear ratio and the distance
travelled. We have been analyzing the market and the customer preference for a
long time and hope to offer you nothing but the best.  We also aim to offer all the social networking
necessities required in this technological era along with the ability to share
your ratings and rankings set on the unique Technotreon segments. We are also
thinking on the lines on backer accessibility and aiming to make replacements
and free upgrades just a finger swipe away all through the app. Any kind of
review and consumer complaint could be filed right there on the app itself.
That apart, we are aware that software development is tedious and can take
longer than expected. But fear not, since we are as tough as the problems! We
ready to tackle any unforeseen problem head on. But at the end we rely on our
backers and funders for support and patience if we run into difficulties and
delays for we know it is you who matters to us most at the end of the day.<br/>

<p><b>                                 Bike Type Transformation Customization</b></p>
<p>Technotreon Alpha
offers a feature which no other bike in the world does, Type Customization. We
found that the need of every individual is different and there exists no bike
to satisfy them all. So we did what we aim to here at Technotreon, reinvent. We
came up with a unique bike transformation program. You could choose your bike
type, your way. We customize the bike to fit your exact standards and intended
purpose. Following is a list of detailed types of bikes we offer in this
particular arena</p>
<ul>
<li>Road Bicycles are designed for
     traveling at speed on paved roads.</li>
<li>Touring Bicycles are designed for bike touring and long journeys. They
     tend to be comfortable, durable and have cargo capabilities.</li>
<li>Commuter bikes are designed specifically for commuting
     over short or long distances. It typically features derailleur gearing, thin
     wheels, fenders, and storage area. A well-equipped commuter bike typically
     features front and rear lights for use in the early morning or late
     evening hours encountered at the start or end of a business day</li>
<li> <i>Hybrid bicycles </i>are a compromise between the mountain and racing style bicycles which are featured to have a light frame, medium gauge wheels, and derailleur gearing, and feature straight or curved-back,<i>touring </i>handlebars for more upright riding.</li>
<li>City Bikes are optimized for the
     rough-and-tumble of urban commuting. It usually feature mountain
     bike-sized (26-inch) wheels, a more upright seating position, and wide
     heavy belted tires designed to shrug off road hazards. They also feature
     full fendors, suspension system and lighting for all night riding.</li>
<li>Comfort bikes are equipped with derailleur rather than the
     inefficient hub gearing. They typically have a modified mountain bike
     frame with a tall head tube to provide an upright riding position, 26-inch
     wheels, and semi-slick tires. Comfort bikes typically incorporate such
     features as front suspension forks, seat post suspension with wide plush
     saddles with a comfortable handle bar.</li>
<li>Mountain bicycles (also called All Terrain
     Bicycle) are designed for off-road cycling. All mountain bicycles feature
     sturdy, highly durable frames and wheels, and wide-gauge treaded tires for
     stability in unpredictable terrain. Mountain bicycles feature a dedicated
     suspension systems and mechanical disc brakes with multi gearing
     ability.</li>
<li>Cruiser Bicycles re heavy framed bicycles designed for comfort,
     with curved back handlebars, padded seats, and balloon tires. They are also called beach
     bikes or boulevardiers and are designed for comfortable travel. A cruiser
     is single-speed with coaster brakes, we also offer cruisers that range up to
     seven speeds. Aluminum frames have been used in Cruiser type construction,
     lowering weight. </li>
<li>Track Bikes, intended for indoor or
     outdoor cycle tracks or velodromes are exceptionally simple compared with road bikes.
     They have a single gear ratio, a fixed drivetrain (i.e. no freewheel),
     usually no brakes, and are minimally adorned with other components that
     would otherwise be typical for a racing bicycle.</li>
</ul>
<p>We
also offer a range of tire thickness in the Full Customization Package tailored
to your specific needs and intended usage.</p>
<p><b>                                                           Color Options</b></p>

<br/>
<p></p>
<p><b>                                            Drop Down Handle Bar Upgrade</b></p>
<p>Drop-bar handlebars are
lightweight &amp; aerodynamically designed to reduce air resistance. They are a
viable option if you want to go faster or are more concerned with efficiently
transferring your energy into making the bike move forward. They also allow for
a greater number of riding and hand positions than standard flat-bars which
allows you to be in a comparatively relaxed position with negligible strain
over hands, wrists and shoulders. This increased versatility comes with the
tradeoff of being slightly less efficient (from an aerodynamic standpoint) than
the typical drop-bar road bike.</p>

We absolutely guarantee that we would deliver every single reward than you paid for with your hard-earned money.

Steve Jobs
Introducing the world’s first
tri-suspension bike, the TECHNOTREON ALPHA. 
We proudly claim that there does not exist a bike to match its stability
or comfort anywhere close to its offered price. 
And to add another exquisite feature, we made it theft-resistant so that
you experience the freedom of riding into unchartered territories your way. It
has a revolutionary in-frame lighting system which makes it practically
impossible to steal your headlights and sabotage your night riding safety.  Every person on Earth is unique or this is
what we like to believe. So why can’t his objects of such importance be as
unique as him/her. Unfortunately we cannot do anything about your phone or your
car but what we could do is offer you the ability to reinvent your bike….your
way. Technotreon Alpha boasts of LIMITLESS customization.  Your Alpha can be made to reflect you in
every way possible. Custom paint job, unique name printing, customized decals,
favorite automotive inspired vinyls or special bike type transformation
customization. You name it. If you can imagine it, we can do it. There is nothing
we can’t display on your very own unique Alpha. Experience bike riding in a way
you never really did.


The patented design of Technotreon Alpha is definitely the most unique in the world. For all intents and purposes the design consists of two individual unique components, the wheel tri-suspension and the in-frame suspension.


                     WHEELS

 Its revolutionary wheels are the next level of technology since the invention of the ‘hub less wheels’ in the 1980s. A single wheel consists of three shock absorbers positioned at such an angle that they preserve and conserve momentum, increase propulsive efficiency and effectively act as the WORLD’s most advanced suspension system not just in the biking industry but in the entire transportation technology. There is no explanation required about the benefits of this tech in offroading in any kind of terrain (we tend to include grass, mud, sand, gravel, dunes and semi flood in our definition!) but little did we at Technotreon anticipate that they work exceptionally good even in urban commuting and cruising at high speeds. The angle formed by the suspension system makes the wheels very efficient during high speeds and hence increase stability and comfort which is seldom found in retail bikes and only exist in custom racing cycles. Hence we are proud to present an all-terrain biking experience.


                      FRAME

This feature of the Technotreon Alpha is particularly awesome, simply because it takes frame suspension to a whole new level. It would be a gross understatement to say that this is a better frame suspension than any other bike has to offer in the entire world.  What it actually does is convert not just your rear wheel into a shock absorber but transforms the entire lower length of your bike into a retracting compressing spring. And when added with our patent pending wheels, this effectively transforms your Technotreon Alpha into a rolling cushion. The shock absorber is located vertically in the center and with its axle uniquely positioned over the front fork, makes the bike an invincible suspension vehicle which is way apart from what the biking industry has ever seen.


                     DESIGN

Every person has the right to stand out. The Technotreon Alpha cannot help you in your job but it can definitely make you look different while riding. It has been designed in such a way that it tends to stand apart. We increased the length of the frame by 15% as compared to standard bikes and decreased the height by 10% to improve its aerodynamic capabilities and thereby increase its speed and decrease your effort. Also it is adaptable to any electric bike module just in case you want to motorize your beloved Alpha. And this does not end here, there are a lot of bike thieves these days and we know how painful it is to lose such a beloved possession. That is why we designed it to be ANTI-THEFT. Yes, you are a fantastic reader and you read it right! Having a theft-resistant bike is a bare necessity during such times. And your beloved beauty will have all of the adequate features to keep conspiring thieves at bay. It will have custom wheel bolts with supplied attachment so that only you could access the wheels. The rest of the bike is design welded and custom fitted to serve you for years to come without ever being stolen.




                  BIKE SIZE

We want you to be as comfortable as possible during your leisure time or your commute. This means that your bike should be a perfect fit for you. Due to the unique frame design of our Technotreon Alpha we could cater to heights beginning from 135cm (53”) to 195cm (78”) which is by far one of the best height ranges any bike has to offer. 





       ELECTRONIC LIGHTING
Technotreon Alpha has the best
lighting system ever. Not only because it is powered by a massive 2.5 Ampere
battery which could go on for weeks with standard night usage or because it has
USB ports located under its seat and optional ports on the handle bar but
because it’s the only real anti-theft light in the market.  We absolutely guarantee the safety of your
headlights. Technotreon Alpha has first-of-its-kind IN-FRAME lighting
technology which basically means that the lights are permanently welded in your
bike and cannot be stolen. With most of the wiring through the frame, the only
way to steal its lights is by slicing the handlebar itself with an angle
grinder. (The thief is in for a lot of work!). The headlight can be tuned for
urban or cross country night riding at the push of a button.  Also your Alpha has specifically designed LED
turn signals with the most comfortable triggers ever. Each side trigger is
located on the respective side of the handlebar which is the first time a bike is
utilizing this obvious feature. This drastically improves accessibility and shortens
the reaction time ultimately leading to upgraded safety.

            APP DEVELOPMENT

Along
with the numerous features of the Technotreon Alpha, we also cater to the
thirst of Techies and fitness freaks with in-development app. We have a
dedicated professional software developing team working to make your ride as
easy and interactive as web browsing! The app is expected to offer your ride
stats such as speed, time and distance while also recording further stats such
as calories burned with respect to the selected gear ratio and the distance
travelled. We have been analyzing the market and the customer preference for a
long time and hope to offer you nothing but the best.  We also aim to offer all the social networking
necessities required in this technological era along with the ability to share
your ratings and rankings set on the unique Technotreon segments. We are also
thinking on the lines on backer accessibility and aiming to make replacements
and free upgrades just a finger swipe away all through the app. Any kind of
review and consumer complaint could be filed right there on the app itself.
That apart, we are aware that software development is tedious and can take
longer than expected. But fear not, since we are as tough as the problems! We
ready to tackle any unforeseen problem head on. But at the end we rely on our
backers and funders for support and patience if we run into difficulties and
delays for we know it is you who matters to us most at the end of the day.

             CUSTOMIZATION





                                 Bike Type Transformation Customization
Technotreon Alpha
offers a feature which no other bike in the world does, Type Customization. We
found that the need of every individual is different and there exists no bike
to satisfy them all. So we did what we aim to here at Technotreon, reinvent. We
came up with a unique bike transformation program. You could choose your bike
type, your way. We customize the bike to fit your exact standards and intended
purpose. Following is a list of detailed types of bikes we offer in this
particular arena

Road Bicycles are designed for
     traveling at speed on paved roads.
Touring Bicycles are designed for bike touring and long journeys. They
     tend to be comfortable, durable and have cargo capabilities.
Commuter bikes are designed specifically for commuting
     over short or long distances. It typically features derailleur gearing, thin
     wheels, fenders, and storage area. A well-equipped commuter bike typically
     features front and rear lights for use in the early morning or late
     evening hours encountered at the start or end of a business day
 Hybrid bicycles are a compromise between the mountain and racing style bicycles which are featured to have a light frame, medium gauge wheels, and derailleur gearing, and feature straight or curved-back,touring handlebars for more upright riding.
City Bikes are optimized for the
     rough-and-tumble of urban commuting. It usually feature mountain
     bike-sized (26-inch) wheels, a more upright seating position, and wide
     heavy belted tires designed to shrug off road hazards. They also feature
     full fendors, suspension system and lighting for all night riding.
Comfort bikes are equipped with derailleur rather than the
     inefficient hub gearing. They typically have a modified mountain bike
     frame with a tall head tube to provide an upright riding position, 26-inch
     wheels, and semi-slick tires. Comfort bikes typically incorporate such
     features as front suspension forks, seat post suspension with wide plush
     saddles with a comfortable handle bar.
Mountain bicycles (also called All Terrain
     Bicycle) are designed for off-road cycling. All mountain bicycles feature
     sturdy, highly durable frames and wheels, and wide-gauge treaded tires for
     stability in unpredictable terrain. Mountain bicycles feature a dedicated
     suspension systems and mechanical disc brakes with multi gearing
     ability.
Cruiser Bicycles re heavy framed bicycles designed for comfort,
     with curved back handlebars, padded seats, and balloon tires. They are also called beach
     bikes or boulevardiers and are designed for comfortable travel. A cruiser
     is single-speed with coaster brakes, we also offer cruisers that range up to
     seven speeds. Aluminum frames have been used in Cruiser type construction,
     lowering weight. 
Track Bikes, intended for indoor or
     outdoor cycle tracks or velodromes are exceptionally simple compared with road bikes.
     They have a single gear ratio, a fixed drivetrain (i.e. no freewheel),
     usually no brakes, and are minimally adorned with other components that
     would otherwise be typical for a racing bicycle.

We
also offer a range of tire thickness in the Full Customization Package tailored
to your specific needs and intended usage.
                                                           Color Options
Standard color
options include the Royale Red-Black, Pearl Sky Blue-Black and Full Matte Black
These can be
customized and a custom paint job option can be selected in the  Customization packages to include the color choice required.





                                              Basic/Premium Customization
In the Basic
customization package the Technotreon Alpha can be modified to include unique
name printing on the body frame and a decal style from over 10 alternatives.
These customizations will be confirmed via Email after the campaign. 
The Premium
Customization Package offers everything that you could humanly dream of. It
comes along with the BIKE TYPE CUSTOMIZATION TRANSFORMATION to suit your
specific needs. It also includes a custom paint job along with your own color
demands for specific components, Name printing, customized decals and not to
forget your favorite automotive inspired vinyls. Need a particular logo on your
beloved Alpha…You got it. Want a specific color to suit your riding likes…fear
not. If you can imagine it, we can do it!




                                            Drop Down Handle Bar Upgrade
Drop-bar handlebars are
lightweight & aerodynamically designed to reduce air resistance. They are a
viable option if you want to go faster or are more concerned with efficiently
transferring your energy into making the bike move forward. They also allow for
a greater number of riding and hand positions than standard flat-bars which
allows you to be in a comparatively relaxed position with negligible strain
over hands, wrists and shoulders. This increased versatility comes with the
tradeoff of being slightly less efficient (from an aerodynamic standpoint) than
the typical drop-bar road bike.

even a TECHNOTREON ALPHA(s). When your friends have contributed an equivalent
to the amount shown below you will be rewarded. And yes, even now we stay true

<h3>EverCharge Range Extender</h3>
<h3>The Team</h3>
<p>I have a management background dealing with engineers and IT professionals. Over the course of 8 months I've consulted with many different Engineers and designers. My team and I have put in over 1,100 hours in building an electric car from the ground up. We took a stock 99 VW Golf and made it 100% electric.</p>
<p>What you are looking to help fund is groundbreaking. There is no other product like it on the market. This product has SUCCESSFULLY passed all the tests and we have a WORKING PROTOTYPE.  Imagine being able to say you were a part of making electric cars part of normal driving culture. </p>
<p>-Weight: About 48+- pounds</p>
<p>-Output: 440 Wh to a maximum potential of up to 35,520.074 Wh for the next phase prototype</p>
<p>-In comparison</p>
<p>-Nissan Leaf EV has a 660 pound battery at 21,000 Wh</p>
<p>-Tesla P90 has a 90,000 Wh battery 1,200 pounds</p>
<p>-Each device can link together adding more electricity for an even longer driving range</p>
<p>-Device is able to connect to any electric vehicle</p>
<p>-Entire unit can fit in about a 15” x 15” box</p>
<p>-It can work with all types of batteries found in an EV.</p>
<p>- It does not impact performance. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Breakdown of the funding.</p>
<ul>
<li>I'm looking for $77k to get the product ready for licensing.<ul>
<li>$20k will go to obtain a PCT patent which will give us protection globally</li>
<li>Remainder of the funds will go towards bringing the product to market</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Main focus is getting the PCT patent done. Any funds will first go to that.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Put aside the lowering levels of gas around the world. Put aside the environmental factors. If you only focus on this being a huge contributor to getting the electric car into the main stream, I'd say that's big enough. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>As with anything groundbreaking, technology is a factor. Currently the technology does exist to make this happen. It's just a matter of sourcing the right equipment from the right vendors and then modifying it to work as I need it. Everything that has been built and tested was bought off the shelves and modified. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>You may not be able to financially contribute. You can still help. Please spread the word. Pass the link along and tell your friends. Good thoughts and prayers are also very much needed. Helping the world get off fossil fuel is not a small task but one that's finally achievable. </p>
<p>If you're thinking of going for The BIG PAPA perk but want to have assurance that the prototype works. I'll gladly make you this deal. Your attorney or mine, can draft papers stating that your funds will go into an escrow account. You and your team can run the prototype through all the tests you want, in the course of 48 hours. If the device doesn't successfully PASS any of the statements I made in this proposal, you'll not only get 100% of your money back but I'll give you 5% of any money this invention ever makes. Your funds will only be released to me upon succesfully passing the tests.  That's how sure I am of my invention. </p>

My team and I have put in over 1,100 hours in building an electric car from the ground up. We took a stock 99 VW Golf and made it 100% electric.
What you are looking to help fund is groundbreaking. There is no other product like it on the market. This product has SUCCESSFULLY passed all the tests and we have a WORKING PROTOTYPE.  Imagine being able to say you were a part of making electric cars part of normal driving culture. 
-Weight: About 48+- pounds
-Output: 440 Wh to a maximum potential of up to 35,520.074 Wh for the next phase prototype
-In comparison
-Nissan Leaf EV has a 660 pound battery at 21,000 Wh
-Tesla P90 has a 90,000 Wh battery 1,200 pounds
-Each device can link together adding more electricity for an even longer driving range
-Device is able to connect to any electric vehicle
-Entire unit can fit in about a 15” x 15” box
-It can work with all types of batteries found in an EV.
- It does not impact performance. 

What We Need & What You Get
Breakdown of the funding.

I'm looking for $77k to get the product ready for licensing.
$20k will go to obtain a PCT patent which will give us protection globally
Remainder of the funds will go towards bringing the product to market


Main focus is getting the PCT patent done. Any funds will first go to that.


The Impact
Put aside the lowering levels of gas around the world. Put aside the environmental factors. If you only focus on this being a huge contributor to getting the electric car into the main stream, I'd say that's big enough. 

Risks & Challenges
As with anything groundbreaking, technology is a factor. Currently the technology does exist to make this happen. It's just a matter of sourcing the right equipment from the right vendors and then modifying it to work as I need it. Everything that has been built and tested was bought off the shelves and modified. 

Other Ways You Can Help
You may not be able to financially contribute. You can still help. Please spread the word. Pass the link along and tell your friends. Good thoughts and prayers are also very much needed. Helping the world get off fossil fuel is not a small task but one that's finally achievable. 
If you're thinking of going for The BIG PAPA perk but want to have assurance that the prototype works. I'll gladly make you this deal. Your attorney or mine, can draft papers stating that your funds will go into an escrow account. You and your team can run the prototype through all the tests you want, in the course of 48 hours. If the device doesn't successfully PASS any of the statements I made in this proposal, you'll not only get 100% of your money back but I'll give you 5% of any money this invention ever makes. Your funds will only be released to me upon succesfully passing the tests.  That's how sure I am of my invention. 
Now. Who's ready to invest in the future?",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Why we're passionate about this</h3>
<p>EcoBike is a start-up company that wants to shake up the bike-sharing industry in a number of ways. Two of the most precious commodities in life is our health and time, and we want to help you with both!</p>
<p>The majority of students that travel to university from their halls or accommodation primarily walk, due to the cost of other transport options or simply, it is the most convenient. When I was a student, I had to walk over 45 minutes to get to university from my flat, and that is a lot of time wasted. Just think, one and a half hours a day simply getting to lectures and back - I could do so much more in that time. What if we could reduce that time to 30 minutes, without breaking the bank?</p>
<p>Well, that's exactly what we plan to do.  People are becoming aware that transport options are limited in most towns and cities, and whilst universities and local authorities are trying to do something which is sustainable and environmentally-friendly, it simply isn't always cost-effective. One example of a bike-sharing scheme in the U.K, which costs the tax-payer, for one bike docking station and 10 bikes, costs £10,000! That is a ridiculous sum of money due to bureaucracy and many other issues that come with publicly-funded schemes. Most of these systems are heavily subsidised by either business through sponsorship, local authorities, central government and charities. We can provide a stationless system for much less, meaning we can pass these savings onto the user.</p>
<p>In the U.K, we cycle a very small amount (4% average of the U.K population). I'd like to change this, and bring us inline with our European neighbours. How can this be done? Simple - provide truly affordable, convenient transport with added benefits via our app. </p>You'll not only get a new, fast, affordable and environmentally free transport option to get around your town, city or university, but you'll also help to plant new forests, contribute to cleaning our nations fantastic yet rubbish ridden beaches, reduce pollution, reduce congestion, increase health and fitness or even donate to a general fund for EcoBike to donate to our partners. EcoBike will have a network of bikes around your area to allow you to get from A to B with ease. <p> </p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>In 2017, we understand that transparency is key for backers and that’s why we’re upfront about our costs. So here’s a breakdown of what we have worked out to be the total cost of this project. We want to run a small crowdfunding project for our MVP (minimal viable product) - which means we're able to provide the app, a few bikes to test and trial with users and our admin service at the most basic level. We want to show that our way is better than all others in this market - with the help of you! </p>
<p>1. <strong>App development</strong> - <strong>£6,000</strong></p>
<p>2. <strong>IndieGoGo Fees</strong> - <strong>£800</strong></p>
<p>3. <strong>5 bikes including locks</strong> for demonstrating our bikes around the U.K - <strong>£1,000</strong></p>
<p>4. <strong>Marketing budget</strong> - to spread the word of EcoBike - <strong>£1,500</strong></p>
<p>5. <strong>Buffer money</strong> for unforeseen expenses - <strong>£700</strong></p>
<p>6. Staff costs - <strong>£0</strong> - We're doing this all without pay, because we believe in this company so much, so <strong>ZERO</strong> of the money we raise will go directly to us. </p>
<p><strong>What happens if we over-fund?</strong></p>
<p>We'd be absolutely thrilled if we over-funded, as we could do so much more with the money. Any money we get over our £10,000 target, we'll use that to make a better app, add improved features, purchase more bikes to showcase in the U.K and visit universities, towns and cities to spread the word about EcoBike. Simply put, the extra money would speed up our plans and bring us to launching much quicker! So every little helps.</p>
<p><strong>So what are the perks of this app?</strong></p>
<p>It couldn't be simpler to use the app. We've designed it so that you can find a bike in the user's vicinity, with icons clearly showing where the bikes are. You can tap on the bike you want, and reserve it for up to 10 minutes, giving you time to walk to the bike's location as well as ensuring that you have a ride home. Once the user finds the bike, they scan the QR code - wait a few seconds and ta daaa, the Smart Lock will unlock and off they go. Simple right?</p>
<p>Bikes will be conveniently located around university halls and the campus - so that at any time, a user will be within a 100m radius of a bike. Convenience, affordability and user-driven experiences are what EcoBike is founded on.</p>
<p><strong>Key Perks of the App</strong></p>
<p>Some of the most interesting perks of the app are the following:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Tracks calories / miles / co2 saved / money donated to charity</strong></li>
<li><strong>Allows users to connect with friends so - friend leaderboards show stats</strong></li>
<li>
<strong>Membership fees for </strong><strong>monthly / yearly</strong><strong> access or pay per use - flexible + affordable use</strong>
</li>
<li><strong>Social-media focussed - interactive experience with friends, family and peers</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Our goal is just enough for us to get this off the ground - £10,000 - but with your help, that money will mean that we will be able to ask investors for extra funding to make EcoBike a reality.  </p>
<p>We want you, the backers, to feel a part of this project every step of the way. We know that people who support campaigns on IndieGoGo like to feel part of something special. That's why we're making you, 100% apart of this journey. We'll be adding ways for you to get involved, such as events around the U.K, naming our bicycles for certain areas and even choosing the colours of our bikes. We want lots of feedback to make you all feel one of the team, and above all, a successful launch. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>What will your contribution mean?</p>
<p>It will mean <strong>a lot</strong>! Not only will it get this project funded, we also would love feedback on the project along with your opinions to shape and mould this new venture in the way that you, the users want, rather than what we think you want. </p>
<p>Your contribution will likely mean in the future, we'll be collectively donating £1000's to good causes. You will be a giver in many different ways, you will become part of our team, helping us to protect the UK's air, water, forests and bees plus supporting other charities which aren't all about the environment. You will be an essential cog in the EcoBike by allowing us to promote clean living, healthy lifestyles and create a cycling revolution which will benefit the whole of the UK, not just economically, but personally for people, their health, their wellbeing and much more. </p>
<p>We will update you every day via our YouTube posts or Blog posts, where we'll show you information about meetings with manufacturers and designers, we'll talk about the ins and outs of the business to provide you with the utmost transparent project you'll back. We want you to trust us to deliver on our promises. </p>
<p>We aim to have within 1 year, 1000 bikes on the ground with over 1,000,000 individual hires and 10 million miles ridden, which will result in over ££££ donated to charity, millions of co2 being saved, millions of hours saved for our riders, £1000's saved from switching to a low-cost transport option and most likely, a fitter group of people.</p>
<p><strong>Be a backer</strong>, and make this happen. We have big goals - this is just the beginning. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Our initial work has led us to the current point we're at. We have the bikes ready to be made, with our bike designed, we have a factory ready, we have the app developer ready to go, we have the locking mechanism and GPS tracking system ready, we have found potential offices in London, we have spoken with shipping companies for the bikes. There isn't too much that will go wrong, but we all know anything in life can go wrong.</p>
<p>We are prepared for any issue that may come up - be it production, the rewards our backers will receive or the final hurdles of getting the bikes on the ground for users to hire. </p>

WHAT STARTED THIS JOURNEY  
I was in my 1970 VW bus making a colossal mess trying to eat while balancing my ""to-go meal ""precariously on my lap.  As I was contorting myself around the steering wheel, I said ""this is ridiculous, there has to be a solution for this!"" 
 So, I went to work, and after numerous prototypes  - much more difficult than I imagined - The Wheel Tray was born.  Soon, others were asking  ""do you have one for my car""? Now creating a universal fitting Wheel Tray that works on the majority of cars in the world that have different sized steering wheels, mounted at different angles, was a complex challenge.So, what I'm offering on Indie is the solution to that problem. It is the result of many months of work, over a year of development and patent. I think you'll you love it like we do! This (below) is the original VW bus prototype that started this product line!!  

We need your support!! 


Help us make this happen ! We are currently hand-making, a limited number of Wheel Trays but we have to manufacture these at scale because it's impossible to do them all by hand. 

The number of pre-orders we receive will determine our production goals and pricing. 

We also want to hire more people  including single parents, veterans, seniors, homeless and a few special needs individuals like my family business did years before. My family  was awarded Small Company of the Year 7-times by Dunn & Bradstreet.  

Contributors will get a new Made in the USA product  that will grow jobs, help the environment including increasing the market for recycled materials.  

I would love to see Indie peeps blow the roof off this so we can make a difference.

Our 5k goal will help us increase inhouse production and help us partner with  manufacturer. 

Funds raised over 10k expands our Innovation Lab  allowing us to release a number of new products both related and unrelated to The Wheel Tray.Sneak peak of a new innovation coming soon (below)! Any guesses? 


Full funding allows us to start our unique hiring plan for making our sustainably produced, custom Wheel Tray .These will be signed by the person who made them, so you know your purchase made a difference in someone's life.  That signature might be from a vet, a single mom/dad, a special needs person or it might be from me!  

If you know a company  that would like to partner, brand, private label or advertise, let us know.  Below, is one of the early cloth/foam backed prototypes but we changed materials because it was harder to clean in the age of Corona virus. Note the number of fasteners needed to hold the industrial grade elastic backing in place.

Wheel Tray adds a little more fun, enjoyment and convenience in your life, while making your car more useful.

<h3><b>WHAT'S THE SOLUTION?...<br/></b></h3>
<p><b>Many say, carbon free, electric cars.</b></p>

<p>Experts agree that if electric vehicles become widely adopted many 
power companies will have to <b>burn coal</b>, or <b>use nuclear power</b>, to meet 
the electrical needs of these vehicles, <b>Which might not be green at all.</b></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>This excerpt from a UC Berkley study states clearly the challenge: 
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><b>“A super charging Tesla coming online would “feel” to the electric grid as 
if 120 houses came online for half an hour, or like an entire 
neighborhood popping up in the middle of a city.”</b>

</div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p> </p>
<p>The risks associated with 
this project are essentially the same as you would find taking any 
ambitious technological project to production.  We worked hard to 
minimize risk in all aspects of the project.</p>
<p>• <b>Reliability</b>: Some projects fail because their products are 
not reliable or rugged enough for consumer use.  We have Solid works (CAD) models, and Mat Labs, and the coast-to-coast drive will completely prove our technology concept.<br/></p>
<p>• <b>Sourcing</b>: A risk that many hardware projects face is that of
 discontinued items. Our team has experience with production management, and the majority of our parts will be custom made for us.  We’ve learned the value of reliable 
sources and secondary suppliers for key items and embrace that 
philosophy in all NEX systems.</p>
<p>• <b>Safety</b>: Particularly with electric vehicles, it is important
 to have redundant systems.  We only use quality electronics and 
assembly practices, and all of our NEX vehicles will have redundant safety systems
built-in.</p>
<p>• <b>Scalability</b>: Another area many projects fail is inability to
 meet higher-than-anticipated demand.  Our suppliers can handle larger 
orders, but once our technology is proven through this campaign, companies from around the world will be licensing and building based on our patented design. We will not have to build NEX systems for a billion vehicles.<br/></p>We have an aggressive execution plan, and are ready to face the challenges ahead.<br/><br/>

Understanding power requirement of electric vehicles.<br/>The
 average vehicle running on a battery needs about 30 kWh of electricity to power the vehicle for 
100 miles.  (30 kilowatts of power per hour.)<br/><br/>For example, the 
EPA rating for the Nissan LEAF is exactly 
30 kWh per 100 miles.  A Tesla Model S 60 is rated at a combined 35 kWh 
per 100 miles,
 and uses a little more energy since it’s heavier and more powerful than
 a LEAF, while the Chevy Spark EV has a combined consumption rating of 
28 kWh per 100 miles. A box truck, or heavy pickup, might need double or
 triple that amount of electricity to travel 100 miles, and that assumes
 no hills.<br/><br/> At a supply rate of 3 kW, it would take 3 to 7 hours to charge the batteries in the average car.

Dilemma: A situation in which a difficult choice has to be made between two or more alternatives, especially equally undesirable ones. We Want A Robust Economy...
We Want A Healthy, Viable Planet:
But, We Can't Have a Robust Economy Without Transportation.
The Emissions From Cars & Trucks Is Changing Our Planet.
Unless
 you've been living under a rock you know our environment is under 
extreme stress from car & truck emissions... AND WE NEED TO DO SOMETHING!
* There are 253 million cars & trucks on American roads.* There is in excess of 1 Billion cars & trucks worldwide.*  These vehicles emit over 40 Billion tons of EXTRA carbon dioxide into our air each year. YES,""40 BILLIONS TONS 
PER YEAR.""Motor vehicles are responsible for nearly one half
of smog-forming volatile organic compounds
(VOCs), more than half of the nitrogen oxide (NOx)
emissions, and about half of the toxic air pollutant
emissions. Motor vehicles,
including non-road vehicles, now account for 75 percent
of carbon monoxide emissions WORLDWIDE.These toxins are destroying the earths ozone layer.
We want our kids to inherit a prosperous world, which we can only deliver to them through a growing economy,... but we also DON'T want our kids to have to wear SPF 150 sunscreen, because the ozone layer has been destroyed, due to that same economic activity.OUR DILEMMA... 
WHICH DO WE PREFER TO DO WITHOUT... HEALTHY PLANET, OR BOOMING ECONOMY?

Al Gore talked about this dilemma, a few years back... but had no, balanced, political & economic solution to our dilemma, because In a free country people get to make choices.
Free people have a right to drive a car or truck of their choice, HOWEVER, chose to drive that truck 15,000 miles per year, and it emits about  18,000 pounds of CO2 into the air. Choose the  average car and it emits about 11,000 pounds of CO2!Vehicle by Vehicle, It Adds Up To 40 Billion Tons of CO2 Per Year And We All Play A Part.

Governments are pushing the mini-electric car concept, but consumers, especially American consumers, want big powerful cars, and so the auto industry keeps making them.
So, government tries to force new regulations...


But, BIG AUTO Continually Pushes Back...(Excerpt) - Wall Street Journal Article: ""... Car companies are laying the groundwork to seek some relief when the targets come up for review by regulators in 2017, executives said at the North American International Auto Show in Detroit...""

WHAT'S THE SOLUTION?...
Many say, carbon free, electric cars.
The reality is, there is no ZERO carbon footprint. The mass adoption of electric cars, that need to pull power from our electric grid, might make the situation worse.

Experts agree that if electric vehicles become widely adopted many 
power companies will have to burn coal, or use nuclear power, to meet 
the electrical needs of these vehicles, Which might not be green at all.


This excerpt from a UC Berkley study states clearly the challenge: 



“A super charging Tesla coming online would “feel” to the electric grid as 
if 120 houses came online for half an hour, or like an entire 
neighborhood popping up in the middle of a city.”



That’s one Tesla, now, imagine 1 million Tesla’s.
Coal plants are the nation’s TOP source of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, the primary cause of global warming. In 2011, utility coal plants in the United States emitted a total of 1.7 billion tons of CO21.  A typical coal plant generates 3.5 million tons of CO2 per year2. 
""Do we want to burn 3x the amount of coal to power electric cars?"" 
NO!






Let’s Face It, Our Dilemma Won't Be Solved Using Current Thinking & Technology.  







Current engines are only 23% efficient & dump about 19 lbs of CO2 into the air for every gallon of gas they burn.  
Current Hybrids use these old engine designs, which only generate about 3kW of electricity - TO LITTLE TO HELP HYBRIDS REALLY COMPETE WITH PURE ELECTRIC CARS, IN TERMS OF EMISSIONS 

The Dilemma Can Only Be Solved Through A Business Driven Solution Acceptable To The Green Generation. 

'Business Driven' Means:
 We must offer consumers vehicles of the size and power they desire, so they will purchase them: To Drive Our Economy & Become Part Of The Solution.


'Acceptable to the Green Generation' Means: Those  vehicles need to be electric, or a vastly improved hybrid, with a minimal carbon footprint: Saving Our Environment. 
THE TECHNOLOGY REQUIRED TO MEET THE GOALS OF BOTH IS A SUPER-CHARGER, AS ENVISIONED BY TESLA, BUT ONE THAT'S SMALL ENOUGH TO FIT IN THE VEHICLE & RUNS ON JUST A SIP OF GASOLINE.


WOLVERTONBAILEY HAS INVENTED THAT ENGINE SYSTEM... 








 The NEX Engine System is a Level 2 | 3 Charger (Super-Charger.) The enormous electrical power provided by the NEX engine system will offer needed flexibility for a manufacturer wanting to build vehicles with drive power and  outstanding mileage - to reduce CO2 emissions.


In our vision the NEX engine's
 exclusive role will be to recharge the battery -  effectively creating, an electric vehicle with its own charging system, that runs on a sip of gasoline.  NEX Technology by the Numbers: 

The average NEX vehicle would emit about 1000 lbs of CO2 each year -vs- current levels of 11,000 pounds. A reduction of  around 10,000 pounds of CO2, per vehicle, per year.


 A Nex vehicle has 1200% more available electric power, then current hybrids of the same size.
A NEX vehicle will have 200-300% better MPGe.

This Could Translates into a 34 Billion Ton Reduction In CO2 Emissions A Year: 
""Shouldn't We Make This Happen?""
The NEX Engine System solves many of the problems keeping industry from beating the dilemma, by making available 1200% more electric power than today's hybrid engine systems. It's enough power to even power light trucks.   The NEX Engine Sytems is Comprised of 4 Important Modules:

Current hybrid engines produce about 3kW of continuous power. The NEX system produces 1200% more, or 36Kw from the same size engine.
 Remember, every gallon of gas burned emits about 19lbs of CO2 into the 
atmosphere, so the longer a vehicle can run on batteries the better for our environment. 

 

WHAT WE NEED YOUR HELP WITH:


WE NEED TO:- Push our technology into the popular consciousness.
- Tap into & leverage the enthusiasm of millions of consumers who want cleaner motive power.- Become visible to major competitors - on OUR terms.- Getting NEX Technology noticed around the world.- Getting maximum 'free media' coverage.

We plan to accomplish the above goals by driving two NEX vehicles coast-to-coast.



Drive One NEX Car and One
NEX Truck 2980 miles, from our offices in Santa Rosa, CA. to a
location, to be chosen, in New York, NY,  to demonstrates a 200+ MPGe for the car, and 57+ MPGe for the
truck.  Our demonstration truck is an Isuzu model box truck and the demonstration car will be a Factory Five 818 S kit car. We have chosen these models because each has already been made electric. NEX system integration will give each vehicle its own power supply, since the wheel motors and the majority of the electrical system is already in place. This saves both time and money, on the integration.




Don't You Need More Money?
Yes, this is a $1,500,000 project, to integrate the engines into the vehicles and drive them across country. Bringing
 an electric vehicle to production has high up-front costs. This campaign is only a
 part of a much larger fundraising effort, which includes company funds, new investor funds, and The NEX Vehicle Coast-to-Coast Drive Sponsorship Campaign.  
Together, these funding efforts will provide the means for us to 
deliver our technology to the public. But your support is a very 
important part of the whole!  
Even, If
 we don't reach the goals of this campaign, all the money you contribute
 will go into the larger pool of money, and we will get the car and 
truck integrated with our NEX system, and we will complete the 
coast-to-coast drive. Afterwards, we will begin the process of getting our technology into the market & begin eliminating BILLIONS OF 
ADDITIONAL TONS OF CO2 FROM OUR AIR, while offering consumers powerful, fun to drive, electric vehicles.
Please support us, & share our campaign with your friends, through social media, and any other way you can think of.




How Will Funds Be Used?



The funds from this campaign will be used to fund the coast-to-coast drive and related development cost, to showcase
the superiority of NEX technology. 








 PROJECT COST INCLUDE:

- Technical Specialist & Consultants- Purchasing the Vehicles-  System Integration Cost- Drive Expenses- Event ExpensesYour Reward For Helping Us
We're building cars and trucks, and of course we can't give one to 
each of our contributors. (However, we are running a sweepstakes to give
 away the Factory Five 818s NEX car, as a part of our promotional
 campaign for the coast-to-coast drive, and you are welcome to enter, 
just email to request the link. Entry is free.)
The #1 Reasons to Contribute to This Campaign:
 Is because you are as concerned about our planet as we are, and you want to see NEX technology in the marketplace. Together we can demand automakers produce better vehicles, with  smaller carbon footprints, and create millions of new jobs around the world, as each country pushes to replace their old fleets with NEX engine system vehicles.   The NEX engine system 
is an extraordinary advancement to come from a startup company, and 
we're hoping you will add your name to our success. Together, we can 
reduce the impact of transportation systems on the environment, and build stronger economies around the world.Thank You For Your Support!

The company developed its initial models of the charging system’s prime mover, the Counterpoise engine - which powers our Hybridyne electric generator, in conjunction with Cal Poly University, and received its first Patent (US 9,074,527, B2) in July of 2015. 
Additional patents are pending on it’s advanced battery charging systems - including a patent application for a multi-spark device which improves the combustion timing and process in any type of spark ignition engine, including rotary engines. Our multi-spark technology is incorporated into our NEX engine system, but will also be developed as a stand-alone product, as it can be retrofitted into existing spark ignition engines for a 20%-30% efficiency improvement. Multi-spark technology will be a huge help to truck fleets seeking to improve efficiency in engine performance.

  Risks & Challenges  
The risks associated with 
this project are essentially the same as you would find taking any 
ambitious technological project to production.  We worked hard to 
minimize risk in all aspects of the project.
• Reliability: Some projects fail because their products are 
not reliable or rugged enough for consumer use.  We have Solid works (CAD) models, and Mat Labs, and the coast-to-coast drive will completely prove our technology concept.
• Sourcing: A risk that many hardware projects face is that of
 discontinued items. Our team has experience with production management, and the majority of our parts will be custom made for us.  We’ve learned the value of reliable 
sources and secondary suppliers for key items and embrace that 
philosophy in all NEX systems.
• Safety: Particularly with electric vehicles, it is important
 to have redundant systems.  We only use quality electronics and 
assembly practices, and all of our NEX vehicles will have redundant safety systems
built-in.
• Scalability: Another area many projects fail is inability to
 meet higher-than-anticipated demand.  Our suppliers can handle larger 
orders, but once our technology is proven through this campaign, companies from around the world will be licensing and building based on our patented design. We will not have to build NEX systems for a billion vehicles.We have an aggressive execution plan, and are ready to face the challenges ahead.
  Other Ways You Can Help Some people just don't have the money to contribute, and we understand that, clearly.
 But that doesn't mean you can't help:  Get the word out to your friends to check us out, and make some noise about the NEX coast-to-coast drive campaign. Share, Share, Share! Please use the Indiegogo share tools to spread the word!
@ $18 we need 8333 people to support us to reach our goal.
@ $47 we need 3191 people to support us to reach our goal.

If, each of our friends ask five to ten of their friends to support us, we can do it!
   Thank you for your time and support, and we'll see you in New York.FAQ:How much more power does the NEX engine produce, than a regular hybrid engine?
Current hybrid engines produce about 3kW of continuous power. The NEX
 system produces 1200% more, or 36Kw from the same size engine.
 Remember, every gallon of gas burned emits about 19lbs of CO2 into the 
atmosphere, so the longer a vehicle can run on batteries the better for our environment.How much pollution does a vehicle produce?
 How much power does an electric vehicle require?
Understanding power requirement of electric vehicles.The
 average vehicle running on a battery needs about 30 kWh of electricity to power the vehicle for 
100 miles.  (30 kilowatts of power per hour.)For example, the 
EPA rating for the Nissan LEAF is exactly 
30 kWh per 100 miles.  A Tesla Model S 60 is rated at a combined 35 kWh 
per 100 miles,
 and uses a little more energy since it’s heavier and more powerful than
 a LEAF, while the Chevy Spark EV has a combined consumption rating of 
28 kWh per 100 miles. A box truck, or heavy pickup, might need double or
 triple that amount of electricity to travel 100 miles, and that assumes
 no hills. At a supply rate of 3 kW, it would take 3 to 7 hours to charge the batteries in the average car. (Useless for drive-time applications)Note the chart below.",29.0,0,"1 Campaign

</p>
<p>My name is Tatiana Cuadra Bermúdez, and I am a law student and passionate scout leader
belonging to the Association of Guides and Scouts of Costa Rica. I appeal to you for your help in order to
accomplish my dream to be a volunteer for a year at Nocrich Scout Center. <br/></p>
<p><b>Why do I want to be a volunteer there? </b><br/></p>
<p>Nocrich Scout Centre is the only scout centre in Romania. Located in a remote village, it brings the children and young people there a new view on their possibilities, and a helping hand in their personal development. Working with volunteers from across the world, it helps the children with school work, teaches them foreign languages, integrates children from poor families and Roma minorities, and offers them a safe and attractive environment form them to learn and play. The pottery workshop at Nocrich is the only such workshop in the area, and teaches the children free of charge the art of pottery. <br/></p>
<p><b>How does your contribution help? </b></p>
<p>Your money will help me fly to Nocrich and stay there for a year. Most volunteers are short-term ones, and that is why it is very important to have people that stay for longer periods of time and ensure the continuity of the process and the training of the new arrivals, together with activities around the year for the children. Therefore your money are not buying only a plane ticket: they are buying better futures for children that don't have any other people to turn to, and a strong team-player for the Nocrich Scout Centre staff. <br/></p>
<br/>
</div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>To be able to go to Nocrich, I need to raise a minimum of 1200 USD on top of the 900 USD I already managed to raise together with my family and friends. The money I need are for the airfare and visa:</p>
<p>- visa cost 150 USD</p>
<p>- round trip to Mexico 400 USD for visa purposes<br/></p>
<p>- round trip to Romania 1500 USD</p>
<p>- one year health insurance 150 USD.<br/></p>
<p>Once in Nocrich, the Scout Centre will cover my accommodation and meals for the duration of my voluntary service. <br/></p>

How am I going to do that in Romania? In my one year as a volunteer there I will work with children and young people from remote villages and Roma communities, helping them in their personal and social development, doing after-school activities with them, teaching them Spanish and English, playing with them and try to guide them towards a better future. I will do that together with four other long-term volunteers: 2 from Portugal and 2 from the Czech Republic. <br/><br/>Apart from working with the children, I want to get involved in the development of the scout centre. I believe I can bring a positive contribution to the promotion of the centre, attracting new volunteers and running the activities and projects there. <br/><br/>I have a lot of experience in working with children and young people, being a scout leader in Costa Rica for the past three years.

First of all I need a Visa, which I can only take from the embassy in Mexico. That adds another 500 USD to the 1500 USD of the round trip fare from Costa Rica to Romania... <br/></p>
<p>Fortunately my friends from the Romanian Scouts are doing their best to facilitate the Visa process and my scout friends in Mexico are willing to help me while I'm there. <br/></p>

<p>Sie stehen mitten im Leben, und da macht es einen entscheidenden
Unterschied, wie gut Sie stehen. Stellen Sie sich vor, Sie stehen und gehen auf
einem Trampolin. Ein Gefühl des Schwebens erfasst Sie. Und genau so ist es,
wenn Sie in den aergo<sup>®</sup> steigen und zu gehen beginnen. Dann sind Sie
so frei, wie sich Ihre Füße fühlen.</p>
<p><em><strong>„Freiheit beim Stehen, Gehen und
Arbeiten“</strong></em></p>
<p>aergo<sup>®</sup> ist ein neuer, revolutionärer Damenschuh basierend auf
einem schwebenden Fußbett. Sie können sich den Schuh wie ein Minitrampolin in
Fußform vorstellen. Sie stehen in einem Stück Textil, welches sich zu 100%
Ihrer Fußsohle anpasst. </p>

<p><b>* </b><b>Woher kommt der
aergo<sup>®</sup>?</b></p>
<p>Der aergo<sup>®
</sup>ist ein österreichisches Produkt
und wurde in Gmunden, Oberösterreich erfunden, mit verschiedenen regionalen Partnern
entwickelt, designt und wird auch hier in der Region produziert. Der aergo<sup>®
</sup>ist ein regionaler, patentierter
Schuh – nicht aus Fernost - sondern „<b>Made
in Austria</b>“. Wichtig ist uns in unserem Projekt, die Wertschöpfungskette
regional zu nützen und Vorort Arbeitsplätze zu schaffen und abzusichern.</p>
<p><b>* </b><b>Aus welchem Material
besteht der aergo<sup>®</sup>?</b></p>
<p>Der aergo<sup>®
</sup>wird aus hochwertigen Kunststoffen
hergestellt und ist waschbar. Dementsprechend ist der aergo<sup>®</sup> auch
<b>vegan</b>. Selbstverständlich ist die Sohle rutschfest. Die Kunststoffe sind am Ende der Schuhlebenszeit auch recycelbar. Der Schuh besteht aus 2 Komponenten:
Die Schuhsohle mit Schaft und dem schwebenden Fußbett.</p>
<p><b>*</b><b> Gibt es eine Garantie auf
den aergo<sup>®</sup>?</b></p>
<p>Ja, wir
geben <b>1 Jahr Garantie</b>.</p>
<p><b>*</b><b> Kann ich aergo<sup>®</sup>
auch ohne Kreditkarte oder PayPal unterstützen?</b></p>
<p>Ja! Sie
können unter Angabe Ihres Namens, Ihrer e-Mail-Adresse und ggf. Ihrer Wunschprämie

English

Version: The Shoe Revolutionaergo®
is a new revolutionary ladies shoe based on a floating foot bed/inner sole. You
can liken the shoe to a mini trampoline for your foot. Imagine you are standing
on a piece of textile which adjusts completely to the shape of your foot. Together with
Prof. Dr. Andreas Schrempf from the Upper Austrian University of Applied
Science, Medical Science in Linz, Austria it was analysed and proven that the
ankle joints, knees, hips and spine are all supported and relieved by the
floating foot bed. The
knitted foot bed / innersole is permeable to air and offers a good microclimate
to your feet. The shoe is washable and recyclable.

The
sole is made of thermoplastic Polyurethane with excellent abrasion results for
a good and secure floor adhesion.
Made
in Austria.
The Team
The aergo®
project was created by Julia Stoehr and her vision was for a shoe that
relieved pressure when standing for long periods. Together with her partner
Andreas Baatz and a team of specialists the aergo® was developed.
Julia is the
project leader with her economic and project management background. Her
previous occupations and experiences in plastic processing, sporting industry
including general and athletic shoes, and the aircraft interiors industry
enables her to put together this exciting project.
Andreas is
an aeronautical engineer and is responsible for the technical and serial
implementation and quality management.
We
focused on innovative technology in conjunction with progressive comfort and
high quality materials and processing. The result is our aergo®
slip-on shoe for more well-being and relief in everyday life.
The patented shoe technology was developed in conjunction with orthopaedists,
shoe experts, scientists and designers in Austria. 
Last fall the
aergo®  project won the 2nd
place in the Upper Austrian Innovation Competition for 2014 in the category
small-medium sized enterprises.
What do we want to achieve with
the campaign?
Our aim is to finance
the manufacture of 500 pairs of shoes to seek greater market appraisal.
To create an extensive
awareness of this new innovative health shoe and its benefits. (To win friends
and influence people)
For this
we need Euro 20,000.
We
have put together different “perks” or incentives for your engagement. See the pictures in the German section which are self-explanatory . Please also book the shipping cost additionally
to your perks / incentives on international shipping outside Austria.
The
pair aergo® has a special early bird price of Euro 89 during this
campaign, normally costs Euro 119.
If
we do not reach the funding target we will produce a smaller amount of shoes. 
For
additional questions please send a message or comment. You can also reach us by
email: aergo@enaergy.com.
How do we proceed?
The first
feedback from our aergo® shoe customers has been extremely positive and
encouraging, so that when we are successful we will work on the shoe sizes 35,
41 and 42. If the business continues to grow men’s and children’s shoes will be
developed. Also there is a potential for different other types of models, like
closed shoes.
Possible Risks & Challenges
During the
past 5 years we have already faced different obstacles in the project aergo®
which we have overcome. The new product developed and tested with the
supporting team of the Transfer Centre for Plastics Technology in Wels, has
produced a potential for optimising what has been discovered in the process.
Important
is that we have a functioning and comfortable aergo® shoe as result.

How you can support this campaign?
We
kindly ask for everyone’s support. Everybody can support aergo® by
talking about it, by recommending, by becoming a fan on Indiegogo or in the
social media like Facebook, LinkedIn, Xing, etc. and by sharing it or
recommending it personally. The more people know about aergo® and
its team and talk about it the more successful we will be with aergo®. The best help is to buy one of our perks and support our campaign.
We
highly appreciate your support and want to thank you for your engagement and
help for making our health shoe aergo® come true.",22.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>TRW Active -TRW-2, 1x11 Speed Drivetrain</h3>
<p>TRW Active was started by Taber West and Ron Whitling in Los Alamos, NM, the Atomic City. Some of the greatest scientific discoveries in history were made here, so what better place to develop state of the art bicycle components? We are a couple of engineers who love bikes and design components, and we both managed bike shops when we were younger. We decided that there was significant room for improvement in the components currently available and we wanted to do something about it. We set out to develop a complete mountain bike drivetrain, and that is what we are bringing to market now.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1542563405/gj5kgsn6o04m5oacqlhj.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>The TRW-2  components have now been in testing, in real world conditions, in the mountains of New Mexico, Colorado, Utah, and Georgia, for the last 2 years. We have made multiple revisions based on this testing, and rider feedback, and now have the final configuration in production.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1542563613/fedikbuqr1wfofphs4ag.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>The goal of TRW is to bring high quality bicycle components to the world at affordable prices and we stand by the quality of those components. We will use this campaign to expand production, and our R&amp;D capabilities, so that we can continue to  bring new products to market.</p>

<p>This drivetrain will work on new bikes, as well as most existing mountain and commuter bikes. So, whether you are building up a new trail or enduro bike to shred the mountain, or upgrading your existing ride to 1x to give it new life, this drivetrain will get the job done. We are confident you will enjoy these components from your first ride aboard them, and we back them up with a 2 year warranty against defects as well as a low cost crash replacement program. We want you out riding on our components and we want you to tell others about them as well.</p>

<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>We are looking to raise $60,000, or more, from this campaign. This funding will allow us to kick off our continuous production line instead of batch production. Neither of us will be taking a paycheck from this company until we are turning a profit. Instead the funds go to raw materials, tooling, production, assembly, packaging, shipping, and logistics. We will continue to reinvest in TRW Active until production is sustainable on its own. Both of us currently have jobs, so that frees up TRW to expand and grow. One day we hope that we are both doing this as our only job.</p>
<h3><strong>What You Get</strong></h3>
<p>For your support and investment in our company’s future you will receive a high quality complete groupset, or individual components to ride on and enjoy, as well as early notification and special pricing on any new components we produce. Don’t worry, we already have more goodies in testing now, and some really cool things on the drawing board.</p>

<h3>The Cut N Go Seat Belt Cutter</h3>
<p>The Cut N Go safety tool is the ONLY emergency seat belt cutter that is locked on, self-enclosed, mechanically guided and child proof.</p>

<p>Wearing your seat belt improves survival rates when you are involved in any car accident. Unfortunately, many people also fear being trapped inside of their vehicles if and when an accident does happen.</p>
<p>In some cases, seatbelts can jam or become stuck while involved in an accident. This creates a serious life-threatening situation that most people are NOT prepared for!</p>
<p>The Cut N Go solves this problem, allowing you to quickly escape a jammed seatbelt. This device can also be used to break your window once the belt is cut, letting you escape. Unlike other tools that are hard to find or use when you need them, The Cut N Go is always ready to go!</p>

This is safer and more effective than using your hand, elbow, shoe, or anything else we've heard people try to use in these dire situations.   Designed to be a complete awareness kit, The Cut N Go includes stickers that notify the user exactly where to strike the window and lets first responders know that you are CutNGo Equipped. The Inside window sticker helps the occupants of the vehicle identify exactly where to break the window, which is very helpful in a stressful situation. Get home to your loved ones safe and sound.        How do you know it will be there in time of an accident?   The CutNGo is made to lock on your belt forever until used. Made out of Super tough nylon, and self-enclosed to protect the blade and the window breaking carbide tip. Is The Cut N Go safe around children?    Yes, the CutNGo is childproof - at no time can your child access the blade even after being used, since it is designed to be a self-enclosed device. How does it cut the seat belt better than other devices?    It is attached to the seat belt and it prevents the curling in the cutting operation. What else can the Cut N Go do?    It can break your car window to help you escape quickly and safely, rather than having to break the window with your hand, elbow, shoe, etc. How easily does it break the car window?    The tip has engineered and tested to break the window with minimal effort. Will fluctuating temperatures affect the device?    Super-tough nylon has been specified in order to meet the most extreme temperature variations. How do I know I will be able to use this in an accident if I'm dazed or confused?    The CutNGo is designed for easy and quick use - just lift the lever and pull. Also, the window sticker is included so you will see exactly where to strike your window and how to get out in a moment's notice. What if I want to take The Cut N Go off my seat belt?    The CutNGo is designed to remain on the seatbelt. We made it that way so when you need it, it's guaranteed to be there. If you choose to take the CutNGo off your seatbelt, this is not recommended, but certainly better than not having this safety device in a life-threatening situation. Will the airbag deployment affect your device?    The recommended placement of the CutNGo is above the buckle. This makes CutNGo easily accessible and the super tough nylon material is very durable. How will people know if I have The Cut N Go in my car?    CutNGo comes with an orange safety sticker so, in case of an emergency, passengers will see where to strike the window. Also, any good samaritans or first responders that come upon your accident will see the sticker from the outside, so they can help you escape if you are unconscious, injured, or incapacitated. How many times can The Cut N Go be used?    CutNGo is a safety device intended for single use. After use, go to the CutNGo.com to tell your story and include a picture - if you do, we will send you a new CutNGo absolutely free!",32.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Lymousine was developed to address the big issue of poor vehicle/driver utilization rates with existing TNCs deployments like Uber &amp; Lyft.  The founder of Zyleck in his Doctoral program research in the field of on demand transportation and autonomous vehicle potential usage in the ride sharing space, personally carried out, in the Atlanta market, over 1,250 rides on both Uber’s &amp; Lyft’s platforms and made some very interesting discoveries.</p>
<ol>
<li>The results from his research carried out on the data shows that the average loaded trip miles by a vehicle/driver was 8.87 miles, while the average unloaded trip mile was 4.21 miles. The conclusion from this was that a vehicle/driver unloaded miles per trip relative to loaded miles per trip was approximately 47.46%. That is, for every 8.87 miles driven with a passenger the vehicle/driver traveled 4.21 miles without a passenger. Additionally, the analysis showed that the average ride time of a loaded trip was 18.51 minutes, while the average wait time for the next ride was 23.66 minutes. The conclusion drawn was that on average, in a vehicle’s/driver’s work shift, the vehicle/driver spent more time waiting for the next ride than spent giving a rider a ride.</li>
<li>These two results combined and highlighted in his research meant that that the vehicle/driver utilization rates, measured in loaded miles relative to unloaded miles and trip time relative to wait time, were approximately 52% and 44% respectively. These poor utilization rates revelation led Mr. Treasure to conclude that there were significant improvement potentials to be had in the TNC model for vehicle/driver utilization rates and led him to develop his patent pending solution.</li>
</ol>
<h3>How Bad is it now for the Vehicle/Driver working for Uber &amp; Lyft?</h3>
<p>How does Mr. Treasure’s results translate to driver earnings with existing TNCs? He was able to use the data to develop a multilinear regression model to determine, for example, if one was interested in finding the average day’s revenue for 150 loaded miles travelled with 300 minutes of trip time for that day, a driver would earn $133.30. However, from the calculated utilization rates, it would have meant that the vehicle/driver would have amassed for the day another 138 unloaded miles and 398 minutes of wait time. <strong>Looked at in another context, this would have meant that the vehicle/driver would have had an 11 hour and 38 minutes’ work day, doing more than 288 miles of driving for the day, which would translate to less than 12/hr. in gross revenue and approximately $0.46/mile.</strong> These poor results would in part explain why drivers are grossly unhappy with their earnings, majority just work a few hours per week and why Uber &amp; Lyft are unprofitable.</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<ul>
<li>We are looking to raise $250,000. This money will help us with our go to market. However, more important than the actual funds we will raise, we are looking for your support to help create the network effect we will need to be successful.</li>

<li>We are planning to launch city by city using a unique approach in this industry. We are going to use a city franchise model.</li>
<li>Using the municipal definition of a city/town and with the requirement that the city/town must have a minimum of a 10,000 population, we are going to allow an individual/consortium/company to purchase a franchise license for the city.</li>
<li>A Lymousine Franchisee, will be guaranteed a minimum 5% commission on gross ride revenue for all rides originating from that city/town for the duration of the license. More importantly, over a 3 year period of the license we will be guaranteeing that the franchisee earn a minimum of 2.20 times the amount paid for the license. </li>
<li>As a contributor you will be given free rides on the Lymousine network! Additionally, as a rider, for every 1 road mile completed on the Lymousine Network, you will be rewarded with 5 frequent flyer air miles, redeemable on the airline of your choice (subject to conditions).</li>
<li>Your contribution here will go directly towards our go to market campaign whether or not we reach our campaign fund raising goal.</li>
</ul>
</div><h3>The Impact</h3><p>Uber and Lyft have taken an approach to the on demand transportation market that does not equitably benefit, from a monetary perspective, all the stakeholders as it should.

<p>Transport Network companies are poised for success if they get a good impetus to overcome the inertia in creating a network effect.

<li>While it may be noble to think of Lymousine as the ""David"" facing the ""Goliaths"" of Uber and Lyft, Lymousine is not about that.

<h3>Why we think Lymousine is going to succeed</h3>
<p>Lymousine cost structure is significantly lower than Uber's or Lyft and our operational approach is different.</p>
<ol>
<li>Lymousine plan to bring a more efficient structure to the TNC market. Improving the utilization rates of vehicles/drivers, making use of more full time driver participants and keeping the total driver pool levels at controlled limits within each market, will allow Lymousine to make more money per hour, spend less on recruiting drivers to replenish depleting pools, because drivers will be making much more than minimum wage and thus will be incentivized to stay within the Lymousine network and work longer shifts.</li>
<li>Lymousine is not funded by Venture Capitalist money, this means that we are not mandated to provide 10X+ multiples on a return on investment. Lymousine seeks normal profit margins between 15 - 30%.</li>
<li>Lymousine is not developing or plan to develop AVs. That is the function of OEMs, like Ford, GM, BMW, Mercedes, etc.,. Therefore, Lymousine does not have to expend R&amp;D dollars of the magnitude necessary to become an OEM.</li>
<li>Lymousine market strategy is pegged against a franchise model. Therefore, some operational functions will be shifted to franchisees, thus lowering overall customer acquisition cost.</li>
<li>Lymousine is not so much into creating the market for ride sharing, Uber &amp; Lyft have done and is doing that. Lymousine's mission is about bringing a different approach to the market with improve efficiencies and a more equitable revenue distribution to drivers.</li>

Lymousine was developed to address the big issue of poor vehicle/driver utilization rates with existing TNCs deployments like Uber & Lyft.  The founder of Zyleck in his Doctoral program research in the field of on demand transportation and autonomous vehicle potential usage in the ride sharing space, personally carried out, in the Atlanta market, over 1,250 rides on both Uber’s & Lyft’s platforms and made some very interesting discoveries.

The results from his research carried out on the data shows that the average loaded trip miles by a vehicle/driver was 8.87 miles, while the average unloaded trip mile was 4.21 miles. The conclusion from this was that a vehicle/driver unloaded miles per trip relative to loaded miles per trip was approximately 47.46%. That is, for every 8.87 miles driven with a passenger the vehicle/driver traveled 4.21 miles without a passenger. Additionally, the analysis showed that the average ride time of a loaded trip was 18.51 minutes, while the average wait time for the next ride was 23.66 minutes. The conclusion drawn was that on average, in a vehicle’s/driver’s work shift, the vehicle/driver spent more time waiting for the next ride than spent giving a rider a ride.
These two results combined and highlighted in his research meant that that the vehicle/driver utilization rates, measured in loaded miles relative to unloaded miles and trip time relative to wait time, were approximately 52% and 44% respectively. These poor utilization rates revelation led Mr. Treasure to conclude that there were significant improvement potentials to be had in the TNC model for vehicle/driver utilization rates and led him to develop his patent pending solution.

How Bad is it now for the Vehicle/Driver working for Uber & Lyft?
How does Mr. Treasure’s results translate to driver earnings with existing TNCs? He was able to use the data to develop a multilinear regression model to determine, for example, if one was interested in finding the average day’s revenue for 150 loaded miles travelled with 300 minutes of trip time for that day, a driver would earn $133.30. However, from the calculated utilization rates, it would have meant that the vehicle/driver would have amassed for the day another 138 unloaded miles and 398 minutes of wait time. Looked at in another context, this would have meant that the vehicle/driver would have had an 11 hour and 38 minutes’ work day, doing more than 288 miles of driving for the day, which would translate to less than 12/hr. in gross revenue and approximately $0.46/mile. These poor results would in part explain why drivers are grossly unhappy with their earnings, majority just work a few hours per week and why Uber & Lyft are unprofitable.
Figures 1-5 explain pictorially what's described above.






What We Need & What You Get

We are looking to raise $250,000. This money will help us with our go to market. However, more important than the actual funds we will raise, we are looking for your support to help create the network effect we will need to be successful.

We are planning to launch city by city using a unique approach in this industry. We are going to use a city franchise model.
Using the municipal definition of a city/town and with the requirement that the city/town must have a minimum of a 10,000 population, we are going to allow an individual/consortium/company to purchase a franchise license for the city.
A Lymousine Franchisee, will be guaranteed a minimum 5% commission on gross ride revenue for all rides originating from that city/town for the duration of the license. More importantly, over a 3 year period of the license we will be guaranteeing that the franchisee earn a minimum of 2.20 times the amount paid for the license. 
As a contributor you will be given free rides on the Lymousine network! Additionally, as a rider, for every 1 road mile completed on the Lymousine Network, you will be rewarded with 5 frequent flyer air miles, redeemable on the airline of your choice (subject to conditions).
Your contribution here will go directly towards our go to market campaign whether or not we reach our campaign fund raising goal.

The ImpactUber and Lyft have taken an approach to the on demand transportation market that does not equitably benefit, from a monetary perspective, all the stakeholders as it should. Additionally, Uber's & Lyft's long term view of the market is that eventually drivers will and must be replaced with autonomous vehicles (AVs). While we share the view that AVs are the future of transportation, we believe that those that help build the network should continue to benefit at all times.
With your help, we can help to bring another approach to the market as a counter balance to Uber & Lyft, who essentially operate off the same business model.
Lymousine's approach to the market is different in that both riders and drivers are prescheduled, but without taking away the flexibility from the rider and the driver of when or where to be picked up in the case of the rider or in the case of the driver when to start and stop driving. Additionally, Lymousine gives the driver more flexibility in determining start and end locations of work windows.

In simple terms, it's necessary to overcome the chicken and egg situation of which comes first. Lymousine's chicken and egg situation is that of having enough riders to support drivers and enough drivers to support riders. The risk Lymousine faces is that of overcoming this network effect need to create both sides of the market.

To overcome this network effect hurdle, we need your help and the power of social media.
It is this reality of finding a solution to overcoming the creation of this network effect why we are here seeking your help, monetarily and virally spreading the word.
While it may be noble to think of Lymousine as the ""David"" facing the ""Goliaths"" of Uber and Lyft, Lymousine is not about that.

the next steps in the research and development.


To
achieve this goal, we started this campaign to
inform you.


You
can donate now!



Here are some more
informations for you.


We
want free energy for all people and to renew the planet.


Free
energy has the following characteristics:




Free
	energy is clean, does not produce emissions, is environmentally
	friendly and renewable. Free energy is available in unlimited
	quantities.


Free
	energy will become cheap and everyone can use it at no charge. It
	will supersede energy monopolies.


Free
	energy will be / is available locally. High-voltage lines and gas
	stations will not be needed anymore. All energy will be wireless.


Free
	energy is safe and no longer poses a risk to the earth. All
	processes are public and understandable for everyone.


Using
	free energy means it will no longer be necessary to produce energy
	by destroying natural elements. We think it is time to build the
	space energy converter based on the main features by Dr. Nikola
	Tesla.


This
	change brings us more money in every household.


That
	means, that parents will have more time for the kids. Thereby the
	family awareness strengthened again.


Also
	the poverty will be reduced and the life will be re liveable.


The
	realization of this project brings for all people worldwide a
	positive life change.


The
Association Blue Opal can do it





What
will you give us? 



It
is very easy. You can give us the possibility to complete the
research and development.
You can help that all people get the opportunity to use free energy


You
can donate and help now!


What
will you get?


After
we successfully completed the research you can get your lifetime free
energy, after you buy the converter.
Please
close your eyes and think how it can be, not one cent more for gas,
petrol, oil or electricity to pay in your life. Your
children, grandchildren and our nature will thank you.


Risks
& Challenges
Risks?
What
can happen in the worst case?


It
is difficult to describe. Why? We can not see into the future!What
could happen?We are held by a natural disaster of the work. Or a
world war breaks out. Or governments forbid us to build the
converter. Or the scientists will not make it. 

In
the worst case, we will realize with the occupied money our other
environmental projects.


Challenges?
Together,
we can save the planet! We will make the space energy converter and
free energy reality.
At
this moment we do not need more nuclear power plants,
substations, wind turbines and also oil platforms.











You will receive a certificate if you buy the perk R&D!

Other
Ways You Can Help


If
you can't donate money at this time, believe me when I say I
understand the circumstance, but there are other ways you can help.
The
word-of-mouth advertising is still so important, and social media
makes that so much easier! Tell anyone who will listen how awesome
space energy converter and free energy will be and how they can help
bring it to life.


Financial
support is not the only way to help us. Spreading a word about our
campaign would help a lot:


→
Tweet and post as much as
you can! 

→
Use the Indiegogo share
tools! 



We
can make “Free Energy for ALL People” happen. 

Let's
create something greater together! 





If
you want to support us, we would appreciate your help.

Dear readers, dear friends,if not all the 
words are perfectly chosen in English, it is because, that English is 
not my native language and you can not be perfect everywhere. But I know 100% about the technical relationships around the Space Energy Converter.I will build him!

Many greetings Michael Head of Development Association Blue Opal

As
with any project, large and small, there’s always risks challenges
involved. 



Risks
of perks offered:
This
facility is unfortunately associated with risks and therefore not
suitable for all investors. A final designation of all risks and
determining their likelihood it is not possible at the moment.
A
detailed description of the risks of this investment is, that from
whatever reasons, the space energy converter can not be operated .
(Legal approval is denied us. World war breaks out, earthquakes,
natural disasters, death of scientist, or if it turns out,that this

<h3>Durable construction material </h3>
<p>Safety and durability starts with the selection of the material! </p>
<p>Bamboo, really?!<br/>Having bamboo as the main ingredient in a bike might seem odd at first glance, but this hidden gem of material has amazing properties unknown to many of us!</p>
<p>When it comes to flexibility and toughness bamboo beats most tree-based timber.<br/>Skateboards out of bamboo demonstrate that impressively in being hardly breakable compared to boards out of tree-based timber.<br/>Because of these fantastic properties bamboo became our natural choice. We developed the material together with an experienced skateboard producer and developed our frames over a long time to use the maximum of its potential.<br/>In fact the properties are so good in bamboo that producers within extreme sports have been starting to use it to withstand the most gruesome conditions. Bamboo boards work great as construction material in skateboards, ski, surf boards boats and other sport articles – in other words bamboo boards are predestined to build bikes.</p>
<p>Bamboo is a fibre material that is significantly less brittle than aluminium, and much more impact-resistant than carbon fibre. The material fatigue of bamboo under load is very low compared with metals. Bamboo has a unique function of absorbing chocks and is extremely hard to crack!</p>
<p>In order to increase the Norrcycle bike’s durability, we learned from boat builders how to protect the surfaces of our bikes and glue the parts in a long-lasting way.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1579879469/ycqquh4eoluxq6vj4unl.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Safety and durability of the bike </h3>
<p>The Norrcycle bikes have been in use and tested for almost 2 years under all kind of Nordic weather conditions and are certified according ISO 4210.</p>
<p>The German certification provider EFBE is a great specialist in testing and certifying bikes for safety and durability. The bike has been tested on a test stand that simulates 10 years average use under urban conditions. The frame has not shown any signs of weakness after that. In fact, EFBE was very satisfied with the result as they mentioned.  </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1579970286/njmirkaau8jmaszatbaj.jpg"" src=""""/>    <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1579970294/du2fthxkdcquhsjtws3x.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>We are using the experience of boat builders and skateboard producers to glue and protect our bikes against weather and other forces. We developed durable bikes, and bamboo is a great basis.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Sustainability of bamboo  </h3>
<p>While using a bike in itself is a fantastic solution for the environment, why stop there? Bamboo is the fastest growing plant and absorbs the most carbon per square meter in one year – it can grow over 90 cm a day! Norrcycle frames are made out of “materialized CO2” stored in our frames instead of emitting it during production.</p>
<p>Our bikes are durable, last for a long time and avoid the use of conventional materials that have a high carbon footprint. </p>
<p>Norrcycle bikes are glued with a solvent free high-performance adhesive developed in the boat industry, which contains a high amount of plant-based ingredients.</p>
<p>This bike is made by nature for the nature!</p>

</div></div>","Bike of the future 
Norrcycle Elliott might be the most unique and sustainable bike there is!
Norrcycle Elliott is:
Durable Our bike is incredibly durable due to our magic ingredient bamboo that lets uscreate a bike that is ​light, stiff and flexible, all at the same time!

Tested for 2 years under Nordic weather conditions. 
Certified according to ISO 4210 to guarantee you durability and safety. 
Quality tested at EFBE institute

Why we use bamboo instead of other tree wood:


 

 
SustainableWhile using the bike in itself is a fantastic solution for the environment, why stop there?

Addition to bamboo being a natural material it also houses CO2 in the actual frame!
Bamboo can grow up to 1 meter a day which makes it sustainable to produce.
This bike is made by nature for the nature!

 
Riding experienceThis bike is light and stiffness is on par with a good aluminum bike! But what bamboo has that other bike material doesn't is flexibility! 

Bamboo has a unique function of absorbing chocks and is extremely hard to crack!
Light and stiff like any other bike!
Looks dope!This bike sticks out in the masses with style!

 

 
We have 3 options to choose from!
The difference inte the 3 options lies in the different components. So choose the specifics that suits your needs!Psst! Every option have an earlybird version limited to 10 bikes.Ends with ""li"" 
Options:
Ba/Bali- 9 gear shifting - Hydraulic disc brakes 

Bi/Bili- Sturmey Archer S2- Leather handle and saddle- Clean frame without cables 
Bo/Boli- Deore 10 gear rear derailleur- Leather handle and saddle- Shimano Deore disc brake
 
If you have any questions don't hesitate to contact us at: info@norrcycle.com
 
 
As individual as your fingerprint 
While materials like aluminum or steel can be perfectly duplicated they will also lose their perfection and attraction over time.The unique character of natural materials like bamboo, wood or natural fabrics at the other hand just gets stronger with time. 
You will never find a 100% copy. Like every person, each Norrcycle has its own fingerprint by nature.

 
Design your Norrcycle 
for just 50€ you can brand your bike to make it 100% unique!
Its that simple

Until we start building your frame you can change the branding. 



 
Durable construction material 
Safety and durability starts with the selection of the material! 
Bamboo, really?!Having bamboo as the main ingredient in a bike might seem odd at first glance, but this hidden gem of material has amazing properties unknown to many of us!
When it comes to flexibility and toughness bamboo beats most tree-based timber.Skateboards out of bamboo demonstrate that impressively in being hardly breakable compared to boards out of tree-based timber.Because of these fantastic properties bamboo became our natural choice. We developed the material together with an experienced skateboard producer and developed our frames over a long time to use the maximum of its potential.In fact the properties are so good in bamboo that producers within extreme sports have been starting to use it to withstand the most gruesome conditions. Bamboo boards work great as construction material in skateboards, ski, surf boards boats and other sport articles – in other words bamboo boards are predestined to build bikes.
Bamboo is a fibre material that is significantly less brittle than aluminium, and much more impact-resistant than carbon fibre. The material fatigue of bamboo under load is very low compared with metals. Bamboo has a unique function of absorbing chocks and is extremely hard to crack!
In order to increase the Norrcycle bike’s durability, we learned from boat builders how to protect the surfaces of our bikes and glue the parts in a long-lasting way.


 
Safety and durability of the bike 
The Norrcycle bikes have been in use and tested for almost 2 years under all kind of Nordic weather conditions and are certified according ISO 4210.
The German certification provider EFBE is a great specialist in testing and certifying bikes for safety and durability. The bike has been tested on a test stand that simulates 10 years average use under urban conditions. The frame has not shown any signs of weakness after that. In fact, EFBE was very satisfied with the result as they mentioned.  
    
We are using the experience of boat builders and skateboard producers to glue and protect our bikes against weather and other forces. We developed durable bikes, and bamboo is a great basis.
 
Sustainability of bamboo  
While using a bike in itself is a fantastic solution for the environment, why stop there? Bamboo is the fastest growing plant and absorbs the most carbon per square meter in one year – it can grow over 90 cm a day! Norrcycle frames are made out of “materialized CO2” stored in our frames instead of emitting it during production.
Our bikes are durable, last for a long time and avoid the use of conventional materials that have a high carbon footprint. 
Norrcycle bikes are glued with a solvent free high-performance adhesive developed in the boat industry, which contains a high amount of plant-based ingredients.
This bike is made by nature for the nature!

What We Need & What You Get! 

You will get your bike! If we don`t reach our goal, we produce the ordered bikes in smaller numbers. 
We need 50.000 € to produce the bikes and order material for production in the future. 


 
The Impact
We developed the bikes and are ready for production. We have material for 100 bikes on stock in Sweden and Germany. Now we wait for your orders to proceed further.

 
Risks & Challenges
We have tested and certified the prototypes according to CE (ISO 4210) and prepared the production.  We can offer a safe and durable product. Our challenge is follow-up orders and to get new material for this in time to speed up our development. 
We have successfully managed the challenge to transfer the production from a prototype stadium into a serial production scenario. During this process we optimized the production to reach serial quality while becoming more efficient.

<p>There is nothing quite as compelling as having to pay your own way through college.  I still remember working full time and taking classes whenever I could.  The university didn't have an evening program for Mechanical Engineering, so I sometimes took classes at lunchtime on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays.  I would drive to within 1.5 miles of the building, put on running shoes, and run to and from class (I gave up my Tuesday and Thursday lunch hours to make up for travel time).  I remember thinking how great it would be to have something in the trunk of my car that I could use to get to and from class and then have time to eat lunch twice a week.  Well, many years later I found myself solving this problem for others with our Origami folding bikes.  Now, its time to take the next step and bring a properly-engineered folding e-bike into the fray.  </p>

OUR PROJECT AND THE CHALLENGES
FACED:-
This year we are taking up a bigger challenge by participating in the SAE SUPRA
INDIA 2015. We wish to take this challenge on to a global platform by also
participating in the Formula SAE ITALY 2015. 
This new task poses a
significant challenge to us in terms of design and the costs associated with
it.
1. 
A
600cc Honda CBR engine is a monumental step-up from the 300cc Briggs and
Stratton engine.
2. 
Carbon
fiber A-Arms will help further reduce 12 kilos. 
3. 
We
are also the first team from India to use a turbocharger.
Also taking part in both
these events is advantageous because:
· 
The
same vehicle is permitted to be used for both events.
· 
Any
issue in design or performance in the former event can be adjusted or improved
before the latter event, which being more prestigious can enhance our exposure
and reputation further.
USE OF FUNDS:
We are wholly self-funded
and hence any form of contribution is useful.
All contributions go
towards the project.
The most benefitting
areas include:
· 
Carbon
fiber Impact Attenuator design
· 
Turbocharger
· 
Expenses
involving logistics of the car to-and-from Italy.
THE IMPACT
Participation in these
events is very beneficial to our educational progress and will also open more
doors towards further advancement in our vehicle’s design.We deeply apologize for not being able to give back to the

<b>What is Autogear ?</b><br/>CambioAuto=AutoGear(TM) is our electonic low to high speed system.<br/>Instead of an automatic gear or a mechanical &gt;20 gearbox we adopt a variable speed technique taken from the indoor track races. You can adjust the desired high speed by personalize the chain to Your everyday needs.<br/> This way You will have an automated electronic speed due to the tensioner + engine combination. Over this You can change top speed and speed spurt accelleration during the ride using the front gear.

<b>Does this Bike provide regenerative energy ?</b><br/>In the meaning of recharge the batteries while breaking, the answer is No! <br/>Regen break charges the battery a low amount wasting energy in heat, so You will have an hot motor, hot cables and hot batteries reducing overall efficency.<br/>In the meaning of reduce the battery energy consumption, the answer is Yes! <br/>When You think to reduce speed the motor will use the potential energy of speed and downhill to contrast the airflow force by reducing or cutting power from batteries. Isn't that cute?</li>

warranty?</strong><br/>Yes! We use high quality components and our bikes come with a One Year Warranty. If  any parts break or are defective they will be covered under this warranty. We will ship replacement parts free of charge in this case. Note this does not include rider damage, like hitting a tree going balls out downhill on the Freerider.</p><p><strong>How do I get replacement parts?</strong><br/>We'll be opening an online store where you can purchase components, accessories and even bikes in the near future. </p><p><strong>Where can Nirvana e-bikes be serviced?</strong><br/>Nirvana e-bikes are designed to be very simple, and are just like a normal bike. Any reputable bike shop will have the tools to work on our bikes and make any changes if needed. We will provide documentation and/or video of possible replacement processes to ensure quality work.</p><p><strong>What colors are available?</strong><br/>Matte green and Matte black.</p><p><strong>How do you charge the battery and how long does it take?</strong><br/>The battery can be charged either on or off the bike. If you live in an apartment building you don’t need to lug it up all those stairs to charge it.. It takes around 4/5 hours to charge.</p><p><strong>Will the charger work with 120V and 220V outlets around the world?</strong><br/>Yes, the charger is rated 100-240V and uses the same power cable that desktop computers use. Works in every country. </p><p><strong>Can you charge the bike by pedaling to increase range?</strong><br/>No, such a system defies the laws of physics and would decrease the overall range of the bike rather than increase it. Because the efficiency of dynamos and motors is only in the 80-90% range, such a system could only convert ~80% of the energy you put into pedaling into motion.

We use high quality components and our bikes come with a One Year Warranty. If  any parts break or are defective they will be covered under this warranty. We will ship replacement parts free of charge in this case. Note this does not include rider damage, like hitting a tree going balls out downhill on the Freerider.How do I get replacement parts?We'll be opening an online store where you can purchase components, accessories and even bikes in the near future. Where can Nirvana e-bikes be serviced?Nirvana e-bikes are designed to be very simple, and are just like a normal bike. Any reputable bike shop will have the tools to work on our bikes and make any changes if needed. We will provide documentation and/or video of possible replacement processes to ensure quality work.What colors are available?Matte green and Matte black.How do you charge the battery and how long does it take?The battery can be charged either on or off the bike. If you live in an apartment building you don’t need to lug it up all those stairs to charge it.. It takes around 4/5 hours to charge.Will the charger work with 120V and 220V outlets around the world?Yes, the charger is rated 100-240V and uses the same power cable that desktop computers use. Works in every country. Can you charge the bike by pedaling to increase range?No, such a system defies the laws of physics and would decrease the overall range of the bike rather than increase it. Because the efficiency of dynamos and motors is only in the 80-90% range, such a system could only convert ~80% of the energy you put into pedaling into motion. On the other hand, if you simply used this energy to propel the bike, you can put almost 100% of that energy into motion.Why on the Freerider model is the motor in the crank rather than in the rear hub like most electric bikes?A mid drive motor system is incredibly efficient.

</p>
<p></p>
<h3>Why are we doing this?</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Everybody is aware of the effects of
	transport in cities but not all of us experience the issues caused by water based transport. Smelly exhaust gas and particle emissions
	from polluting engines are causing <b>serious health issues</b> and
	contributing hugely to <b>global warming</b>, which ultimately results in
	dramatic natural disasters. Noise, pollution and vibration from
	operating boats shake the foundations of nearby buildings, destroy peace and
	relaxation, drive away wildlife.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Our <b>oil dependency</b> has serious global
	consequences. It causes conflicts and crisis with its unstable
	prices and unsustainable supply, let alone major environmental and
	safety problems at oil fields, oil refineries and during
	transportation. <span style=""background-color: initial;"">Every year there are several incidents where oil
spillages destroy beaches, marshlands, fragile aquatic ecosystems;
harming animals; causing deaths, injuries and economic damages.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Whilst ‘clean &amp;
	green’ technology is now making good progress in the automotive
	industry, such a revolution has still lagged far behind in the marine
	world. <i>“The industry has been caught by a circular argument.
	There’s been nothing that the customers can buy off the shelf –
	so they won't ask for it. At the same time, the big manufacturers
	are not offering greener solutions as there’s no queue of
	customers. The risk for manufacturers to offer such products is
	high. And frankly, there seems no need for them to change because
	their business works as is.”</i> explains our founder, Dr Dennis
	Doerffel. We want to<b> break through this vicious cycle that prevents
	the revolution of 'clean &amp; green' technologies</b>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Why? <span style=""background-color: initial;"">Because someone should… and we can. </span><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Our partner in Venice states: <i>“Cleaner technologies should be well established
by now. It is really overdue.”</i></span></p>
<h3>What are we doing?<br/>
</h3>
<p></p>
<p>REAPsystems
are creating a <b>clean drop-in hybrid diesel electric engine</b> that can
be installed by any boat builder and fitted into all existing boats.
At this stage, we are starting with a Venice water taxi to demonstrate the technology. We
believe that this solution can address all the current challenges.</p>
<p></p>
<h4></h4>
<h3>How does it work?</h3>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>This hybrid
system uses the latest diesel engine technology paired with a
<b>high-power, compact and efficient</b> electric motor &amp; inverter as well as a
modern lithium-ion battery and advanced system control unit.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>This is a
<b>parallel hybrid configuration</b>, where both units – the diesel and
the electric - are connected to a conventional sterndrive. In the
city, the engine can be 'clutched out' to allow pure electric drive.
Here, at low speed and where it matters most, we will benefit from
all the advantages of the electric motor: no noise, no pollution, no
vibrations, no fuel consumption. During medium to high speed, the
diesel engine automatically and smoothly takes over. During diesel
operation, the electric motor works as a generator, recharging the
batteries and pushing the engine into a more efficient engine
loading. During fast transients of the diesel engine, the electric
motor may also assist in order to reduce exhaust emissions.</p>
<p></p>

<p><i>This photo

<h3>How does it help?</h3>
<div>
<p>Apart from the <b>environmental benefits</b>
mentioned above, we estimate an <b>average fuel saving of at least 50%</b>
if compared with current diesel engine boats. This is thanks to the
ultra efficient electric motor and clever control system.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The electric motor is <b>very responsive</b>, it
can operate down to zero rpm and change smoothly from forward to
reverse rotation. This gives the driver <b>impressive manoeuvrability</b> –
much better than what can be achieved with existing diesel engines.
It will allow a more controlled and safe operation in the confined
spaces of Venetian canals - all without gear changes.</p>
<p>As a <b>drop-in and compact
</b>solution the hybrid electric drive-train <b>can be installed into existing diesel boats by any boat builder</b> either as a replacement or
as an add-on to an existing diesel engine. There is virtually <b>no
compromise on passenger or cargo carrying capabilities</b>.</p>
<p>The diesel engine only
runs when high output is required. This is what they are designed
for. No need for long, inefficient and damaging idle operation. In
short, it will run less and better, <b>increasing engine life</b>, <b>reducing
emissions</b> and <b>minimising maintenance</b>. In fact, we believe that the
biggest saving for the operator will be in their cost of maintenance.
This is one of the points that we want to prove with the
demonstration in Venice.</p>
<p>The hybrid system
comprises two systems in one. Hence, the operator will benefit from
<b>high reliability and peace of mind backup</b>. If there is an issue with
the diesel system, it will be possible to get home with the electric
system or if there is any issue with the electric system then the
conventional and proven diesel system can be used.</p>

<h3>Why not pure electric?</h3>
<p></p>
<p>There has
been an unsuccessful project in Venice with a taxi boat and since
then, authorities are not keen on pure electrics. They fear they
would need a fleet of rescue vessels to tow stranded boats with empty
batteries. If the boat was pure electric, a single run to the airport
and back would require a battery capacity of 150 kWh. Such a large
battery is very costly. Additionally, they would need a network of
fast charging stations in order to support the 20 other runs to the
airport on the same day... So, in this case, one innovation (pure
electric boats) is not possible without the other (fast recharging
stations), making it hard to get off the ground.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>We agree
that ultimately, <b>if we want to be fully sustainable, we cannot rely
on oil at all</b>. We will have to run our boats either on renewable
liquid fuels (e.g. ethanol) or on compressed gas or with high energy
density battery systems and a network of recharging stations or using
human power or wind.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>However,
these technologies are currently not feasible for the marketplace (I
am happy to discuss this one...). We don't want to wait for the “big
decision” nobody wants to make. <b>We want to start making changes now
instead of waiting for the “big idea”</b>.  The marine industry is
very risk averse and resistant to change. So, any change in the
marine industry is difficult - continuous improvement has a better
chance. It is better to make a small change now that can reach many
instead of aiming for the big change that will take another 15 years.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Our hybrid
technology will get everyone started and thinking. <b>The infrastructure
for our technology is fully developed and the acceptance is high</b>. A
typical engine in a Venice water taxi has a short life and after
that it can be replaced with the next technological step. It is just
important that <b>we get MANY people interested in sustainability NOW</b>.
Our informative display and control system will change the drivers
perception and raise awareness. 
</p>
<p>If you are
interested in more technical or philosophical discussions, please see
our perks. We have a few on offer that will allow you to meet our
team, see the technology in operation or discuss on the phone. Any
input welcome!</p>

<h3>Why Venice?</h3>

<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1464112049/Venice_grand_canal_mgdpi1.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><i>The Grand Canal in Venice, Italy.</i></p>
<p></p>
<p><u><b></b></u></p>
<p>
<u><b>Big
Impact:</b></u></p>
<p>Venice,
a unique and irreplaceable UNESCO World Heritage City has 550 water
taxis and buses serving its tourist industry of 32 million visitors a
year, plus approximately 20,000 engine-driven private boats
circulating in the Venice lagoon for recreational purposes. Therefore Venice suffers from <b>alarming levels of air and noise pollution, as
well as the vibration of these engines</b>, all of which dramatically
effect the canal water, priceless city architecture and human health. <span style=""background-color: initial;"">With
REAPsystems' drop-in hybrid electric solution, the city, its
residents and visitors will benefit from clean air, clean water and a
quieter environment; its taxi operators will enjoy lower fuel
consumption, operating costs and overall cost of ownership plus
greater reliability and longer life without sacrificing performance;
drivers and their passengers will also enjoy the comfort of a hybrid
taxi boat with minimum noise, vibration and emissions.</span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>A
'drop-in' Hybrid-drive system for easy installation in Venice's
existing water taxis means that <b>the current fleet can be quickly and
easily converted by any boat builder to provide cleaner, greener
transport</b>.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><u><b>Great
Proving Ground:</b></u></p>
<p>One
of the reasons for the slow uptake of clean hybrid technologies in
the marine market is the high reliance on the reliability of the
engine. Also, the cost of training staff world-wide for maintenance,
repairs and operation for any new technology is significant. Venice
represents a tough testing ground to prove the reliability and
longevity of our hybrid solution. A standard 9 metre water taxi typically has a <b>long, hard 20 hour day</b>. There are <b>many boats in a
very confined area, which means that the cost for training
maintenance staff can be limited</b>.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><u><b>Very
Suitable Scenario for Hybrid Technologies:</b></u></p>
<p>Hybrid
engines don't make sense for every scenario. Our parallel hybrid
engine is most suitable for <b>varying operations that require low speed
or idle periods for extended lengths of time as well as high-speed
operation for some time</b>. Venice needs both: quiet, low vibration, low
emission and good manoeuvrability at low speed inside the canals of
the city as well as fast taxi runs with several people on board to
the airport.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><u><b>Setting
the Standard - Great Timing:</b></u></p>
<p>The
timing is perfect to <b>influence the new regulation on boat emissions about to be imposed by Venice authorities</b>. The
local authorities are currently working on new legislation concerning
pollution from water-borne traffic. We hope that with our
Hybrid-drive demonstrator operating in the lagoon, proving its
environmental benefits, together with our partner in Venice, we can
influence the legislation to favour the uptake of this green
technology and set the standards. 
</p>
<p></p>
<h3></h3>
<h3>What are our aims?</h3>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Our
short-term aim is to develop <b>a hybrid electric taxi-boat prototype</b>
that will be demonstrated and endurance tested in Venice this year,
then to influence the new regulation on vehicle emissions to be
imposed by the local authority.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Following
this, we will get the hybrid engine into<b> production and roll-it out
to Venice and other places</b>. Then, we will develop variants of this
technology. So that we can cover <b>a wide range of applications and
crafts</b>. In order to achieve this, we will work with our partners and
with existing manufacturers of engines. Other applications include
work-boats such as wind farm support vessels, patrol craft, small
passenger ferries and fishing boats, survey vessels and private
tenders.</p>

<h3>Why do we need your help?</h3>
<p>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>Banks would
never finance such a risky investment. Even for investors, the risk
is too high for the potential gain. The margins for manufacturers in
the marine market are relatively low compared with the risk and
investment of innovation. </p>
<p><b>So far we
have been putting our own money into the project.  However, we are a
small business and without your help we cannot afford to focus on
Project Venice and put the required resources in</b>. We need your

now - it is overdue!</p>
<p>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>We want to
involve the public - get people interested and excited about this
technology and demonstrate how it can help our environment and health
as well as reducing our oil dependency. “<i>Our crowdfunding campaign
is a complete reversal of the usual commercial approach. We involve
the public on our journey. This way we can kickstart the hybrid
revolution together.</i>” says our founder, Dr Doerffel.</p>

Clean Hybrid Engines for Boats




Greener cars are
finally arriving. Now it's time to kickstart the revolution on water.
We are developing a clean and green hybrid electric engine, which
can be dropped into existing boats.



Let's clean
up our marine environment. Water cities like the Venice Lagoon are crowded with thousands of boats using polluting diesel engines.  We
will prove the technology and its reliability to the public in this
UNESCO protected heritage site. The benefits are clear: no noise, no
pollution, no vibrations when operating in the city. Our
demonstration with the water taxi will inform the local authorities,
so they can tighten their regulations. Thus, the reduced maintenance
cost and the halved fuel consumption will convince operators to
switch to these green engines. Once proven in Venice, we will roll-out this technology globally. The time for change is now.


Your investment will directly accelerate
the development of the next generation marine power systems. We
believe in a high quality of life for everyone and we are constantly
in pursuit of a better way. Help fund a sustainable future.

A report by That's Solent TV about Project Venice in April 2016. It then featured in a BBC programme of the best of local TV.



Why are we doing this?


Everybody is aware of the effects of
	transport in cities but not all of us experience the issues caused by water based transport. Smelly exhaust gas and particle emissions
	from polluting engines are causing serious health issues and
	contributing hugely to global warming, which ultimately results in
	dramatic natural disasters. Noise, pollution and vibration from
	operating boats shake the foundations of nearby buildings, destroy peace and
	relaxation, drive away wildlife.




Our oil dependency has serious global
	consequences. It causes conflicts and crisis with its unstable
	prices and unsustainable supply, let alone major environmental and
	safety problems at oil fields, oil refineries and during
	transportation. Every year there are several incidents where oil
spillages destroy beaches, marshlands, fragile aquatic ecosystems;
harming animals; causing deaths, injuries and economic damages.


Whilst ‘clean &
	green’ technology is now making good progress in the automotive
	industry, such a revolution has still lagged far behind in the marine
	world. “The industry has been caught by a circular argument.
	There’s been nothing that the customers can buy off the shelf –
	so they won't ask for it. At the same time, the big manufacturers
	are not offering greener solutions as there’s no queue of
	customers. The risk for manufacturers to offer such products is
	high. And frankly, there seems no need for them to change because
	their business works as is.” explains our founder, Dr Dennis
	Doerffel. We want to break through this vicious cycle that prevents
	the revolution of 'clean & green' technologies.


Why? Because someone should… and we can. Our partner in Venice states: “Cleaner technologies should be well established
by now. It is really overdue.”
What are we doing?


REAPsystems
are creating a clean drop-in hybrid diesel electric engine that can
be installed by any boat builder and fitted into all existing boats.
At this stage, we are starting with a Venice water taxi to demonstrate the technology. We
believe that this solution can address all the current challenges.


How does it work?



This hybrid
system uses the latest diesel engine technology paired with a
high-power, compact and efficient electric motor & inverter as well as a
modern lithium-ion battery and advanced system control unit.


This is a
parallel hybrid configuration, where both units – the diesel and
the electric - are connected to a conventional sterndrive. In the
city, the engine can be 'clutched out' to allow pure electric drive.
Here, at low speed and where it matters most, we will benefit from
all the advantages of the electric motor: no noise, no pollution, no
vibrations, no fuel consumption. During medium to high speed, the
diesel engine automatically and smoothly takes over. During diesel
operation, the electric motor works as a generator, recharging the
batteries and pushing the engine into a more efficient engine
loading. During fast transients of the diesel engine, the electric
motor may also assist in order to reduce exhaust emissions.


This photo
shows our founder, Dr Dennis Doerffel with the diesel engine and the
high power electric motor. This size of electric motor could power a whole pilot boat at more than 6 knots, which demonstrates the high power density and efficiency of electric machines.



Rendered images of the hybrid diesel electric engine to be installed in our original Venice water taxi.
How does it help?

Apart from the environmental benefits
mentioned above, we estimate an average fuel saving of at least 50%
if compared with current diesel engine boats. This is thanks to the
ultra efficient electric motor and clever control system.


The electric motor is very responsive, it
can operate down to zero rpm and change smoothly from forward to
reverse rotation. This gives the driver impressive manoeuvrability –
much better than what can be achieved with existing diesel engines.
It will allow a more controlled and safe operation in the confined
spaces of Venetian canals - all without gear changes.
As a drop-in and compact
solution the hybrid electric drive-train can be installed into existing diesel boats by any boat builder either as a replacement or
as an add-on to an existing diesel engine. There is virtually no
compromise on passenger or cargo carrying capabilities.
The diesel engine only
runs when high output is required. This is what they are designed
for. No need for long, inefficient and damaging idle operation. In
short, it will run less and better, increasing engine life, reducing
emissions and minimising maintenance. In fact, we believe that the
biggest saving for the operator will be in their cost of maintenance.
This is one of the points that we want to prove with the
demonstration in Venice.
The hybrid system
comprises two systems in one. Hence, the operator will benefit from
high reliability and peace of mind backup. If there is an issue with
the diesel system, it will be possible to get home with the electric
system or if there is any issue with the electric system then the
conventional and proven diesel system can be used.







Why not pure electric?

There has
been an unsuccessful project in Venice with a taxi boat and since
then, authorities are not keen on pure electrics. They fear they
would need a fleet of rescue vessels to tow stranded boats with empty
batteries. If the boat was pure electric, a single run to the airport
and back would require a battery capacity of 150 kWh. Such a large
battery is very costly. Additionally, they would need a network of
fast charging stations in order to support the 20 other runs to the
airport on the same day... So, in this case, one innovation (pure
electric boats) is not possible without the other (fast recharging
stations), making it hard to get off the ground.


We agree
that ultimately, if we want to be fully sustainable, we cannot rely
on oil at all. We will have to run our boats either on renewable
liquid fuels (e.g. ethanol) or on compressed gas or with high energy
density battery systems and a network of recharging stations or using
human power or wind.


However,
these technologies are currently not feasible for the marketplace (I
am happy to discuss this one...). We don't want to wait for the “big
decision” nobody wants to make. We want to start making changes now
instead of waiting for the “big idea”.  The marine industry is
very risk averse and resistant to change. So, any change in the
marine industry is difficult - continuous improvement has a better
chance. It is better to make a small change now that can reach many
instead of aiming for the big change that will take another 15 years.


Our hybrid
technology will get everyone started and thinking. The infrastructure
for our technology is fully developed and the acceptance is high. A
typical engine in a Venice water taxi has a short life and after
that it can be replaced with the next technological step. It is just
important that we get MANY people interested in sustainability NOW.
Our informative display and control system will change the drivers
perception and raise awareness. 

If you are
interested in more technical or philosophical discussions, please see
our perks. We have a few on offer that will allow you to meet our
team, see the technology in operation or discuss on the phone. Any
input welcome!


Why Venice?




The Grand Canal in Venice, Italy.



Big
Impact:
Venice,
a unique and irreplaceable UNESCO World Heritage City has 550 water
taxis and buses serving its tourist industry of 32 million visitors a
year, plus approximately 20,000 engine-driven private boats
circulating in the Venice lagoon for recreational purposes. Therefore Venice suffers from alarming levels of air and noise pollution, as
well as the vibration of these engines, all of which dramatically
effect the canal water, priceless city architecture and human health. With
REAPsystems' drop-in hybrid electric solution, the city, its
residents and visitors will benefit from clean air, clean water and a
quieter environment; its taxi operators will enjoy lower fuel
consumption, operating costs and overall cost of ownership plus
greater reliability and longer life without sacrificing performance;
drivers and their passengers will also enjoy the comfort of a hybrid
taxi boat with minimum noise, vibration and emissions.



A
'drop-in' Hybrid-drive system for easy installation in Venice's
existing water taxis means that the current fleet can be quickly and
easily converted by any boat builder to provide cleaner, greener
transport.


Great
Proving Ground:
One
of the reasons for the slow uptake of clean hybrid technologies in
the marine market is the high reliance on the reliability of the
engine. Also, the cost of training staff world-wide for maintenance,
repairs and operation for any new technology is significant. Venice
represents a tough testing ground to prove the reliability and
longevity of our hybrid solution. A standard 9 metre water taxi typically has a long, hard 20 hour day. There are many boats in a
very confined area, which means that the cost for training
maintenance staff can be limited.


Very
Suitable Scenario for Hybrid Technologies:
Hybrid
engines don't make sense for every scenario. Our parallel hybrid
engine is most suitable for varying operations that require low speed
or idle periods for extended lengths of time as well as high-speed
operation for some time. Venice needs both: quiet, low vibration, low
emission and good manoeuvrability at low speed inside the canals of
the city as well as fast taxi runs with several people on board to
the airport.


Setting
the Standard - Great Timing:
The
timing is perfect to influence the new regulation on boat emissions about to be imposed by Venice authorities. The
local authorities are currently working on new legislation concerning
pollution from water-borne traffic. We hope that with our
Hybrid-drive demonstrator operating in the lagoon, proving its
environmental benefits, together with our partner in Venice, we can
influence the legislation to favour the uptake of this green
technology and set the standards. 



What are our aims?




Our
short-term aim is to develop a hybrid electric taxi-boat prototype
that will be demonstrated and endurance tested in Venice this year,
then to influence the new regulation on vehicle emissions to be
imposed by the local authority.


Following
this, we will get the hybrid engine into production and roll-it out
to Venice and other places. Then, we will develop variants of this
technology. So that we can cover a wide range of applications and
crafts. In order to achieve this, we will work with our partners and
with existing manufacturers of engines. Other applications include
work-boats such as wind farm support vessels, patrol craft, small
passenger ferries and fishing boats, survey vessels and private
tenders.

Why do we need your help?



Banks would
never finance such a risky investment. Even for investors, the risk
is too high for the potential gain. The margins for manufacturers in
the marine market are relatively low compared with the risk and
investment of innovation. 
So far we
have been putting our own money into the project.  However, we are a
small business and without your help we cannot afford to focus on
Project Venice and put the required resources in. We need your
support to boost this project. We want to kickstart this technology
now - it is overdue!



We want to
involve the public - get people interested and excited about this
technology and demonstrate how it can help our environment and health
as well as reducing our oil dependency. “Our crowdfunding campaign
is a complete reversal of the usual commercial approach. We involve
the public on our journey. This way we can kickstart the hybrid
revolution together.” says our founder, Dr Doerffel.




Of course,
we do not expect your support for nothing. We have great rewards (“perks” just doesn't sound right here) for you!
Please share
this with as many people as possible. That would be of great
help. Thank you so much!

Designed from the Ground Up
 
We set out to design & create the world's lightest weight multipurpose electric & solar-powered tricycle, made from lightweight fiberglass & aluminum, which also recharges as it moves, for a maximum range of 120 km per charge. A key factor was designing & building the extremely durable lightweight reinforced aluminum (6061-T6) chassis that weighs under = 31 Kg and a reinforced fiberglass body with carbon fiber ribs that weighs under = 23 kg. As even the lightest steel is typically 2.5 times heavier than aluminum. That’s our secret weapon along with the other innovative design concepts in the VEGAN Electric Self-Charging Solar Tricycle.It typically has a range of 90 to 95km on one charge (on batteries alone, without solar assistance and self-charging), but with self-charging and solar, we increased the range to 120 km +, and can carry a fully charged battery to be swapped to double the range to over 240 km.It is the lowest weight multipurpose tricycle ever designed; with a high strength threshold and a lowered production cost which results in better efficiency & of course, affordability. It is roomier and can also carry up to 4 passengers depending on their size, and the back seats can also be folded away to make way for a large loading space, it can basically be converted into a minicab.Operates on 100% solar power or electricity from the national electricity grid & self-charges as it moves. We use a simplistic cost-effective design & materials to come up with a stylish looking aerodynamic, high-efficiency vehicle with a minimum unit cost of only $1400 when we manufacture the windows, frame & body in bulk, but currently, it costs $3,393.70 to make. Once we fabricate our windows & cast the fiberglass body, our cost goes down almost 49%, to $1401,  Tricycles will be available to backers for that price, only through Indiegogo. After that, the price will be no less than $3500 per tricycle, which is still an unbelievable bargain.Its simplistic engineering design is low maintenance due to having a minimalized drive train as the hub motor is directly attached to the rear wheel. Producing an average speed of 30 km/h & an amazing top speed of 70 km/h -- by increased acceleration through our own designed internal gear hub -- and of course has zero carbon emissions.It is also easier to drive due to its dual front tires & there is no need for licenses or registration in most municipalities. Competitors use a one-piece body, that is made of heavy material that directly affects efficiency, and they are not solar & self-charging, but ours is.Equipped with a built-in GPS tracking system & has high-end safety features, including a 12V AC outlet for your gadgets such as Bluetooth speakers & charging your phone.Has a fully concealed cabin for protection from all the external elements, so you can get out & enjoy a ride in any weather.  Why Back the Vegan

 •    Let’s face it, we all like safety, comfort, performance & affordability; with The VEGAN Tricycle, you have all four in one exciting package.•    We came up with the lowest weight multipurpose tricycle ever designed; for better performance which has a higher strength threshold & a lower production cost and weight, •    Is solar panel equipped & self-charges as it moves•    Emits zero carbon emissions. •    Operates on either solar power or electricity from the national electricity grid & self-charges.•    A high-efficiency vehicle with a minimum unit cost of only $1400 to produce—the price of an average mountain bike -- once we reach our funding goal.•    120 km range per charge, with swappable battery, doubling the range to 240 km•    Total weight without extra battery, only 120 km.•    Payload 300 kg.•    Stylish Looks & Aerodynamic Shape•    Built-in GPS Tracking System•    Internal 12V outlet for Bluetooth speakers & charging phones.•    Easier to drive due to its dual front tires.•    No need for licenses or registration in most municipalities.•    High-end safety features.•    Comfortable, Safe, Affordable & Fast We designed the VEGAN Hybrid Electric Self-Charging Solar Tricycle to be the game-changer that it is.  Why is Our Production Cost So Low? Because we will be producing it in the heart of the different manufacturing hubs in Pakistan, where fabricated components of the originals are of superior quality, notoriously cheap & easy to make. It is a logistics nightmare that not many people can pull off, but we have done our due diligence research & already know the producers of a lot of similar components & mechanical spare parts. If we chose, we could have opted to use ""All"" original components but the production cost of the tricycle would be significantly higher. We are not just trying to make a functioning reliable vehicle & profits, but are trying to revolutionize the market by producing a just as high quality -- if not better, tricycle, at a stupendously reduced cost, and once our prototype is finished, have our doors crashing down with pre-orders.  Who We Are We are an honest bunch of visionaries; a mechatronics engineer & two vocational technicians & an educator, who are completely transparent in that we only have the completed conceptual designs so far. We have been working on tricycles for years & specialize in the fields of mechatronics, fiberglass & aluminum fabrication. We just need to build a few functioning prototypes to show the world what a game-changer this is.All manufacturing will take place in Pakistan where raw materials are of the highest quality & very affordable, and select workmanship is more than excellent.  Our Mission  A vegan tricycle in every home, every shop & 100's more in every bustling city & suburb.Manufacturing as many tricycles as possible, hence getting the manufacturing price down as low as we can get it, so everyone can enjoy a Vegan tricycle. We aim to bring the cost down an extra $450 by mass-producing its components. Our Immediate Goal - Stage 1.0Build Our First Working Prototype for $3,393.70 Our main cost now is for the fabrication of the windows, casting, molding & die of the stylish fiberglass body. After we have that, we are good to go, as all other components like our lightweight frame are fabricated in our workshop & the rest can be bought from the local market or select online shops.Our immediate goal is to get the first prototype built, then build five (5) subsequent fully functioning tricycles at a cost of just $1400 each, which equals $7000, plus we need $2000 for logistics, then continue to CrowdFund for “GUARANTEED PRE- ORDER DELIVERIES.”$3,393.70 (prototype) + $5,600 (5 subsequent tricyles) + $2,000 (logistics) = USD $12,393.70 (Our Funding Goal)If we hit our funding goal for this campaign then the first 5 backers who donate $1400 will automatically be contacted to make shipping arrangements for shipping their new tricycle by Feb. 2021.We Know its Ridiculously Cheap & There Probably Are Some SkepticsSo let us break it down for you: The cost of our first prototype is as follows:

 Our Stretch Goal - Stage 1.2To produce 50 VEGAN Tricycles at a cost of $45,000 by getting the price down even further, to $900, as low as it can get, and continue to keep the Vegan tricycle, the world's best value tricycle, selling at only USD$3,500, outside of Indiegogo.We will also invest in more R&D & improving future models, such as adding the option of having an AC, etc. We are not opting for this the first time around as we are specifically concentrating on range, weight & battery life as well as price, in order to break all records. Technical Specs for Us Geeks & Pics of Our Components Solar Panel  BatteryBattery Specs

BLDC Electric HUB Motor & Controller
   
We use a HUB motor that is assembled on the rear tire and will directly control movement, so there is no need for a transmission.
The tire transmits power to the alternator by a chain and sprocket system directly, directly recharging the battery.
We will use our own designed modified generic Shimano-like 5 speed internal hub to control the speed, increasing it from 55  km/h to 70 km/h. We have tested it on similar weight tricycles & have reached this speed succesfully.
  We didn't mess much with the controller as it has proven to work well. Alternator & Sprocket This idea has already been implemented but with our combination of low weight & high capacity battery, we are able to extend the life of each charge by roughly 25%. With our recharging technology we have increased the range by 42%. Suspension

Get ready to drive like the wind.As shown in the graph below, the Ninebot Gokart PRO has a maximum acceleration of 1.02 G, which is almost 1.5 times higher than the previous Ninebot Gokart.The Gokart PRO outperforms a 150cc gas-powered go-kart on tracks with its acceleration.The Gokart PRO is equipped with two wheel hub motors producing 4,800W maximum engine power output and 96Nm maximum torque. This allows the Ninebot Gokart PRO to sprint from 0 to 23 mph within seconds.The Segway-Ninebot app allows you to pre-program your drifting experience depending on your own style or the site condition since the two wheel hub motors are connected separately to each rear tire.Therefore, the Drifting Assistant System can control two motors to provide different power outputs for each rear tire as it drifts, helping the driver to adjust the drifting dynamic in any circumstance. So you can drift like a pro in no time.Get ready to experience go-karting like never before with power oversteer drifting. The rear tires lose traction when turning, resulting in a faster speed cut-corner and dynamic drift. Suitable for both beginners and professionals. Gokart PRO features a remarkable mechanical braking effect  take drifting to the next level. Lifting the handbrake while turning is another way to achieve drifting.Additionally, in the unlikely event that the electric brake fails, the handbrake can be used to stop the vehicle quickly.Don’t forget to release the handbrake otherwise, the Gokart PRO will stop instead of a smooth drift.The cutting-edge TPE rear tires bring users the most exciting drifting experience ever. The controllable rear-end and high-speed cornering make it easier to show off drifting techniques like a professional racer.The Gokart PRO has an RR design; the rear engine and the rear-wheel-drive are set up like supercars. The weight distribution is designed with 40% front and 60% rear. The Gokart PRO comes with a high-strength steel frame that can carry a payload of up to 220 lbs and reduces chassis flex during high-performance driving. The front end of the Gokart features three layers of TPE impact protection to increase the safety of the rider and the whole body is IP54 water-resistant. Additional features such as TPE sides, aerodynamic rear wing, and metal pedals are included to up your Go-karting game.Triple Front ProtectionInner layer: Steel frame can protect the body to maintain the shape.Middle layer: High polymer material can effectively absorb the energy from high collision impacts.Outer layer: TPE front lip can reduce the damage during a collision.Four 8W high-power speakers on the Gokart PRO simulate engine sounds of single-cylinder, two-cylinder, V8, or V12 engines to create a more immersive Go karting experience. The speaker can also be used as a normal Bluetooth speaker to play the rider’s choice of music.Suitable for beginners and professionals, everyone can enjoy the ride.The Segway Ninebot app allows you to control four driving modes, adjust the drifting assistant level, control the light effect, and much more.Select the mode you prefer for safety or energy saving.You can turn on/off the Drifting Assistant System via the Segway Ninebot App. You can also set the drifting assistant level from the control panel after you turn it on, which can be moved from -20 to + 100.●When the number is neutral, there is no power output difference between the inner rear wheel and outer rear wheel. (In this situation, it is recommended to turn off the vehicle.)●When the number is negative, it is suitable for slippery site conditions. and reduces oversteer.●When the number is positive, it is easier to perform drifting and it can boost the oversteer.The Gokart PRO battery is a powerhouse, clocking in with a capacity of 432 Wh, featuring 4 air-ducts and 15.5 miles of range.With 15% hill grade ascent capability, it allows riders to climb the hills with ease. Additionally, the automatic holding system can prevent slipping when the Gokart PRO is parked on a slope.Double tap on the brake pedal to switch into the reverse gear and to drive backward. The Gokart PRO is designed with an adjustable frame and steering wheel to fit riders between 4’5” to 6’3”. The high-strength frame can carry 220 lbs of maximum payload and its high torsional stiffness effectively withstands impacts from the road.Recommend Age: 14+The Ninebot Gokart PRO is collapsible to fit into most vehicle trunks, allowing you to take it wherever you want to go.The Gokart PRO has a power unit that's from our newest Ninebot self-balancing transporter.Segway-Ninebot is a global leader in the field of intelligent short-distance transportation and service robots.

What is different between model V and model C ?
The weight, height, construction materials and battery technology are the areas of difference between the YikeBike models. The lower seat height model V is constructed of hydroformed aluminium and composite reinforced polymers, every bike includes the standard 2 wheel and additional 3 wheel configuration. The model C is our prestigious premium product, with the latest Lithium-Ion battery technology and high-tech Carbon-fiber construction materials on the wheel, frame and steering components. There are only a few model C’s available.





What are the performance figures ?
The Yikebike will fully charge in 90 minutes and has a top speed of 14.3mph (23 kmh). The model V has a range of 8.7 miles (14km), and model C 12.4 miles (20 km). The additional regenerative braking system optimizes the battery performance.





Do I need a helmet ?
Your personal safety is our highest concern, and while your local regulations may not require you to wear a helmet we do recommend you do so. YikeBike has provided you with anti-skid braking and permanent lighting for additional safety.





Can I lock my YikeBike ?
Our lightweight construction and rapid folding means that you can eliminate the risk of theft by taking the YikeBike wherever you go.





Why 3 wheels ?
The 3 wheel assembly has been specifically designed and is only available for the model V. The lower height seat and 3 wheels makes it easy for a first-time rider to get going. This configuration comes standard with every model V and is not compatible with any other version of the YikeBike.





Changing from 3 to 2 wheels ?
The model V can be changed from the compact folding 2 wheel standard bike to the 3 wheel option using the simple instructions and tools that are included with your YikeBike. Changing the entire rear leg will only take you a few minutes. The YikeBike recommended maximum weight limit remains at 220lbs/100kg for both the 2 and 3 wheel versions.

</p><p>We are a team of
young Romanian volunteers, of various professions (students,
architects, software engineers, historians, lawyers, truck drivers,
etc.), backed by local authorities and British <span>railway
</span>enthusiasts. We are gathering since
2008 in our spare time to work and have fun on our railway.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1430730631/gkigtulgal2o5v8dedmc.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/>
<p>Our main objective
is to preserve and gradually restore the 73km long narrow gauge railway which
linked Sibiu  (European Capital of Culture in 2007) to the town of
Agnita in Transylvania, Romania. The railway was built between 1895
and 1910, abandoned in 2001 by the state railway company and has
since fallen prey to nature and thefts. Our endeavour requires
maintenance works such as track clearance of trees and shrubs,
replacing worn sleepers, maintenance of bridges, maintenance and
restoration of railway buildings, spraying herbicide, restoration of
rolling stock and dealing with locals.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1430731014/begrg4t3ayuysug6z755.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>So far we succeeded
to restore several railway buildings, clear the tracks and replace
missing parts, build a carriage shed and restore the body of a
passenger carriage. We also organized the railway’s centenary
celebrations in 2010 by organizing a steam weekend and since then we
are offering tourist rides with our self-made cyclo
and moto-draisines.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1430730994/rlvtrz5ekn9ldzdew63s.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Apart from working, we
also know how to have fun. We go on trips (railway related of
course), we share knowledge with volunteers of foreign railway
organizations, we’re putting together photo exhibitions, raise
signatures for our cause, organize contests amongst children and have
even staged a flash mob. All in order to improve ourselves and raise
the profile of our project.</p>
<p><b>What we plan to do?</b></p>
<p>In the weekend of
26-27 September 2015 we plan to celebrate the Days of Mocănița
(nickname given to narrow gauge railways and trains in Romania) by
running a steam train on 7km of track between the stations of
Cornățel and Hosman.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1430730696/yqsbfd81bvbrzo4zkkro.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/>
<p>Although we are
already running our draisines on this section of track, in order to
sustain the weight of a real train it needs quite a bit of work –
several hundred worn sleepers to be replaced, missing bolts and
plates to be put back, two metal bridges need attention, a level
crossing needs rebuilding and ballast needs to be added to the
trackbed. Renting and transporting a steam locomotive, building
unloading ramps and organizing the event are additional costs to the
above. The railway is listed as a historical monument and the works
mentioned will contribute to its restoration.</p>
<p><b>The Impact</b></p>
<p>The event is to be
first in a series which will take place annually and will bring an
immediate benefit to the <span>local</span>
communities and increase involvement of authorities. On the long
term, it will contribute to the restoration of our railway and help
the development of tourism along the Hârtibaciu
valley. The works done during this project will allow the event to be
repeated o<span>ver
the following years while enabling the volunteers to focus on other
tasks, such as restoring rolling stock and extending the length

</p><br/></div>","Who are we?
We are a team of
young Romanian volunteers, of various professions (students,
architects, software engineers, historians, lawyers, truck drivers,
etc.), backed by local authorities and British railway
enthusiasts. We are gathering since
2008 in our spare time to work and have fun on our railway.
Our main objective
is to preserve and gradually restore the 73km long narrow gauge railway which
linked Sibiu  (European Capital of Culture in 2007) to the town of
Agnita in Transylvania, Romania. The railway was built between 1895
and 1910, abandoned in 2001 by the state railway company and has
since fallen prey to nature and thefts. Our endeavour requires
maintenance works such as track clearance of trees and shrubs,
replacing worn sleepers, maintenance of bridges, maintenance and
restoration of railway buildings, spraying herbicide, restoration of
rolling stock and dealing with locals.
So far we succeeded
to restore several railway buildings, clear the tracks and replace
missing parts, build a carriage shed and restore the body of a
passenger carriage. We also organized the railway’s centenary
celebrations in 2010 by organizing a steam weekend and since then we
are offering tourist rides with our self-made cyclo
and moto-draisines.
Apart from working, we
also know how to have fun. We go on trips (railway related of
course), we share knowledge with volunteers of foreign railway
organizations, we’re putting together photo exhibitions, raise
signatures for our cause, organize contests amongst children and have
even staged a flash mob. All in order to improve ourselves and raise
the profile of our project.
What we plan to do?
In the weekend of
26-27 September 2015 we plan to celebrate the Days of Mocănița
(nickname given to narrow gauge railways and trains in Romania) by
running a steam train on 7km of track between the stations of
Cornățel and Hosman.
Although we are
already running our draisines on this section of track, in order to
sustain the weight of a real train it needs quite a bit of work –
several hundred worn sleepers to be replaced, missing bolts and
plates to be put back, two metal bridges need attention, a level
crossing needs rebuilding and ballast needs to be added to the
trackbed. Renting and transporting a steam locomotive, building
unloading ramps and organizing the event are additional costs to the
above. The railway is listed as a historical monument and the works
mentioned will contribute to its restoration.
The Impact
The event is to be
first in a series which will take place annually and will bring an
immediate benefit to the local
communities and increase involvement of authorities. On the long
term, it will contribute to the restoration of our railway and help
the development of tourism along the Hârtibaciu
valley. The works done during this project will allow the event to be
repeated over
the following years while enabling the volunteers to focus on other
tasks, such as restoring rolling stock and extending the length
of usable track.

All funds raised during
this campaign will be directed towards acquiring new sleepers, track
fittings, ballast, hiring a contractor to rebuild the level
crossing, renting and transporting the steam locomotive and organizing the event.Thank you for your help

</h3><h2> </h2><h2>The SolarBuggy project</h2><p>We are a team of students at Bochum University of Applied Sciences who strive to engineer a buggy which is capable of driving across a sand desert powered by solar energy only. We have already converted a regular buggy into a SolarBuggy called “Open World” and driven across Tanami Road in Australia in 2015, now we dream bigger and better! </p><p>At our university interdisciplinary projects concerning SolarCars have a history of 18 years. We strive to make this world a better one, building vehicles that rely on the sun instead of fuel. In doing so, we show the potential of solar energy, particularly the use of portable energy. This makes it viable for everyone on this planet and it is getting more viable all the time, as cells get better as well. This campaign is aimed at the heart of this project. We need huge solar arrays, because without them, our extraordinary and pioneering project won't be as extraordinary anymore.</p><p>We are planning to build a SolarBuggy every two years in order to get better and better. Currently, we are working on the 2nd project ""Froggee"", engineering a buggy, with which we plan to drive across the Simpson Desert in Australia and set a new Guinness World Record. </p><p>This record is for the fastest time to cross the Simpson Desert by solar-powered land vehicle, following the french line.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1493121621/ytsbq1snbnnyj0sddqsp.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>We have already started working on the 3rd cycle buggy, provisional title PHOENIX. We constantly profit from the experience and knowledge already gained from ""Open World"".</p><p>So what exactly is a SolarBuggy? </p><p>First of all, it does not have a combustion engine but electrical motors instead. What makes it solar is that these motors are powered by solar cells which enable this Buggy to drive without stopping at a charging station. We don't produce any exhaust and therefore don't put a strain on the environment. We can simply stop and charge wherever we are by unfolding our solar array. This energy is of course stored in batteries, so clouds, tunnels and the like pose no problems. We also have cells on the roof to extend our range and hence the time we can drive. </p><p style=""text-align: center;""><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1493121876/mgmbq9uaarzhvoemuysk.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><i>SolarBuggy ""Open World"" in Monaco at Formula E, on Texel and at a quarry</i></p><p>For both of our upcoming projects, 2nd and 3rd cycle, we need solar arrays. We are planning to build one set, which can be used for both buggies as the modules are not fixed, but interchangeable.</p><p>As they are one of the most costly aspects of building a SolarBuggy, this campaign is aimed at financing those arrays. So in turn you are not just helping to realise one project, but keeping it going and realising two projects. </p><p>What you have seen and heard in the video above is of course, as we are developing the project, not final and things can still change. We have, for example, managed to reduce our array size from 30sqm to almost 25 sqm.</p><h3>Our solar array</h3><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1493121995/q7ws74ptrrzgwcctx87a.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><i>Foldable solar modules</i></p><p>To understand what you are financing, here’s an explanation of what a solar array is and how we plan to implement ours. </p><p>To reach our goal of being able to charge our batteries in the desert in 3 hours, we will need approximately 25 sqm of solar cells. This means that we will build two big modules which are foldable and therefore fit inside the buggy. We also have about 2-2.5 sqm of panels on the roof to extend our range. </p><p>The solar roof will be fixed on each buggy, but the big array can be reused. Our plan is to design a resistant array for the 2nd cycle ""Froggee"", take them to Australia and then use them again in the 3rd cycle for PHOENIX. </p><p>An array consists of solar cells which are connected to strings (or panels), and those are then again connected to form a module. These modules form the array.</p><p>This means that in the first step, the cells are soldered to strings, then these strings have to be laminated in several steps. Furthermore, we need to interconnect these strings and implement them in the foldable construction to complete the array. This is quite a costly undertaking, so we are hoping for your support.</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://bosolarcar.de/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/GIF_Array.gif"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><i>Here you can see how a module will be folded for transport</i></p><h3>SolarBuggy ""Froggee""</h3><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1493122088/a7xxhjdci6inbepcuzqs.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><i>SolarBuggy<i> "" </i></i><i>Froggee""</i><i><i> on</i> a little test run at the workshop</i></p><p>In this 2nd cycle ""Froggee"" we are working closely with Eric Vigouroux (Eric Vigouroux Racing- EVR), whom you might know from the Dakar Rally.

I’ve been doing off-road racing for almost 20 years across the most beautiful deserts in the world, but always with petrol powered race cars. I love racing, but I love nature even better, this is why, at the age of 50, I’ve decided to stop my carreer as a rally driver to start a new challenge: designing and building a clean off-road electric vehicle. My dream is to one day be able to go back in the desert with a totally different approach and maybe invent a new way ofracing, where speed won’t be the main goal. Being able to go further by managing energy resources, doing a good navigation, having a good strategy, reading the terrain so the vehicle can progress with less energy is the way for me to do off-road competition in the future.</p><p>After I did a lot of research on the internet, I discovered some very interesting articles about Bochum University of Applied Sciences’ achievements in the field of solar electric vehicles. This is why I met with Auktora in October 2014, I wanted to share my vision with the solar team and see if they were willing to work with me in order to make dream happened. 2 years later, Froggee was born. It is actually the lightest and the most performing off-road electric buggy in the world. When the students of Bochum University of Applied Sciences contacted me with the idea to turn my EVR buggy into a solar vehicle with the goal to set a new record in the desert of Simpson in Australia, I said yes immediately (and not only because we will follow the French line). This is exactly what I want to do for the upcoming year, use my off-road skills to promote sustainable energy and electromobility by taking part take part in this kind of challenges. Having a chance to work with young engineers who will design and build tomorrow’s vehicles is a great opportunity for me. I’m very happy to bring my experience in this project and, together with the students, show the world that today we can go pretty much anywhere with an off-road buggy, only using sustainable energy. I also like the idea of proving to myself that it’s never too late to change for better.""</p><p>While this Buggy is already electrical, neither is it yet fit for a desert, nor was it supposed to be street legal, which it will have to be for our purpose.</p><p>So there is still a lot to be done on the mechanics and the electrics.

 The SolarBuggy projectWe are a team of students at Bochum University of Applied Sciences who strive to engineer a buggy which is capable of driving across a sand desert powered by solar energy only. We have already converted a regular buggy into a SolarBuggy called “Open World” and driven across Tanami Road in Australia in 2015, now we dream bigger and better! At our university interdisciplinary projects concerning SolarCars have a history of 18 years. We strive to make this world a better one, building vehicles that rely on the sun instead of fuel. In doing so, we show the potential of solar energy, particularly the use of portable energy. This makes it viable for everyone on this planet and it is getting more viable all the time, as cells get better as well. This campaign is aimed at the heart of this project. We need huge solar arrays, because without them, our extraordinary and pioneering project won't be as extraordinary anymore.We are planning to build a SolarBuggy every two years in order to get better and better. Currently, we are working on the 2nd project ""Froggee"", engineering a buggy, with which we plan to drive across the Simpson Desert in Australia and set a new Guinness World Record. This record is for the fastest time to cross the Simpson Desert by solar-powered land vehicle, following the french line.We have already started working on the 3rd cycle buggy, provisional title PHOENIX. We constantly profit from the experience and knowledge already gained from ""Open World"".So what exactly is a SolarBuggy? First of all, it does not have a combustion engine but electrical motors instead. What makes it solar is that these motors are powered by solar cells which enable this Buggy to drive without stopping at a charging station. We don't produce any exhaust and therefore don't put a strain on the environment. We can simply stop and charge wherever we are by unfolding our solar array. This energy is of course stored in batteries, so clouds, tunnels and the like pose no problems. We also have cells on the roof to extend our range and hence the time we can drive. SolarBuggy ""Open World"" in Monaco at Formula E, on Texel and at a quarryFor both of our upcoming projects, 2nd and 3rd cycle, we need solar arrays. We are planning to build one set, which can be used for both buggies as the modules are not fixed, but interchangeable.As they are one of the most costly aspects of building a SolarBuggy, this campaign is aimed at financing those arrays. So in turn you are not just helping to realise one project, but keeping it going and realising two projects. What you have seen and heard in the video above is of course, as we are developing the project, not final and things can still change. We have, for example, managed to reduce our array size from 30sqm to almost 25 sqm.Our solar arrayFoldable solar modulesTo understand what you are financing, here’s an explanation of what a solar array is and how we plan to implement ours. To reach our goal of being able to charge our batteries in the desert in 3 hours, we will need approximately 25 sqm of solar cells. This means that we will build two big modules which are foldable and therefore fit inside the buggy. We also have about 2-2.5 sqm of panels on the roof to extend our range. The solar roof will be fixed on each buggy, but the big array can be reused. Our plan is to design a resistant array for the 2nd cycle ""Froggee"", take them to Australia and then use them again in the 3rd cycle for PHOENIX. An array consists of solar cells which are connected to strings (or panels), and those are then again connected to form a module. These modules form the array.This means that in the first step, the cells are soldered to strings, then these strings have to be laminated in several steps. Furthermore, we need to interconnect these strings and implement them in the foldable construction to complete the array. This is quite a costly undertaking, so we are hoping for your support.Here you can see how a module will be folded for transportSolarBuggy ""Froggee""SolarBuggy "" Froggee"" on a little test run at the workshopIn this 2nd cycle ""Froggee"" we are working closely with Eric Vigouroux (Eric Vigouroux Racing- EVR), whom you might know from the Dakar Rally. He came into contact with us through Auktora, a company founded by former members of the SolarCar that still works closely together with us.We wanted to give him a chance to introduce himself and tell his view on our project:Eric Vigouroux""As you know, I’m a former professional rally-raid driver. I’ve been doing off-road racing for almost 20 years across the most beautiful deserts in the world, but always with petrol powered race cars. I love racing, but I love nature even better, this is why, at the age of 50, I’ve decided to stop my carreer as a rally driver to start a new challenge: designing and building a clean off-road electric vehicle. My dream is to one day be able to go back in the desert with a totally different approach and maybe invent a new way ofracing, where speed won’t be the main goal. Being able to go further by managing energy resources, doing a good navigation, having a good strategy, reading the terrain so the vehicle can progress with less energy is the way for me to do off-road competition in the future.After I did a lot of research on the internet, I discovered some very interesting articles about Bochum University of Applied Sciences’ achievements in the field of solar electric vehicles. This is why I met with Auktora in October 2014, I wanted to share my vision with the solar team and see if they were willing to work with me in order to make dream happened. 2 years later, Froggee was born. It is actually the lightest and the most performing off-road electric buggy in the world. When the students of Bochum University of Applied Sciences contacted me with the idea to turn my EVR buggy into a solar vehicle with the goal to set a new record in the desert of Simpson in Australia, I said yes immediately (and not only because we will follow the French line). This is exactly what I want to do for the upcoming year, use my off-road skills to promote sustainable energy and electromobility by taking part take part in this kind of challenges. Having a chance to work with young engineers who will design and build tomorrow’s vehicles is a great opportunity for me. I’m very happy to bring my experience in this project and, together with the students, show the world that today we can go pretty much anywhere with an off-road buggy, only using sustainable energy. I also like the idea of proving to myself that it’s never too late to change for better.""While this Buggy is already electrical, neither is it yet fit for a desert, nor was it supposed to be street legal, which it will have to be for our purpose.So there is still a lot to be done on the mechanics and the electrics. And of course the solar array is also still missing, which we hope you can help us with! The new SolarBuggy PHOENIXThe first design stepsAt the same time as working on the new SolarBuggy, we have already started developing the SolarBuggy PHOENIX (3rd generation). Project PHOENIX’s main aim is to build a vehicle that is perfectly suited to the conditions in an off-road environment. This also means that we build this vehicle from scratch, as the modification of a vehicle always means having to compromise. As conception and development of a new vehicle take a lot of time, we decided to start work early and lay the cornerstone for this ambitious project. It is going to have all-wheel drive, powered via two electrical motors, one for each axle. For an optimal distribution of weight, the traction battery will be located in the centre of the vehicle. The batteries will be fully charged within three hours via the solar generator. To be able to easily manoeuver through difficult terrain and even sand dunes, chassis clearance will be 350mm and motor capacity will be 226 kW peak.Your help is crucialFor the realisation of the project, solar cells are crucial to power the buggy with clean, sustainable energy. This makes the vehicles independent from charging stations and, being an off-roader, also independent from infrastructure in general, therefore leading the way to an autonomous and clean future. Not only do the SolarCar projects of Bochum University of Applied Sciences bring forth innovative ideas, but also help students to a practical and mostly self-governed education additional to their regular courses. Here, skills, teamworking abilities and experience are gained which could never be learned in an auditorium.With your support, we want to make this world a greener one!Charging the SolarBuggy in Darwin, AustraliaOur historySolar electromobility at Bochum University of Applied Sciences can look back at several years of experience. We started off building SolarCars, which are road cars powered by solar energy. In late 2012 the SolarBuggy project, originating from beforehand mentioned SolarCar project, was initialized by the donation of a usual buggy. The SolarBuggy project is being led by a management comprised of students. The students of the team are from different majors like electrical engineering, mechanical engineering, mechatronics and engineering management. In August 2015, the first SolarBuggy ""Open World"" was shipped to Australia. In November 2015 the team successfully travelled across an 829 km-track through the Tanami Desert in 8 days. They challenged sand and dust only with the help of solar energy. It is the first solar based vehicle worldwide that accomplished an off-road track like that.We are also regularly at events like the European Solar Challenge in Belgium.Our ""old"" SolarBuggy on Tanami Road in AustraliaWho we areWe are a team of 25 students from different disciplines, such as electrical engineering, mechatronics, engineering management, facilities engineering management, electromobility and mechanical engineering in bachelor and masters courses. Project management             Marc Blüge                 Sebastian Efkes  Marc is a postgraduate in electromobility and Sebastian in mechatronics.

Which is why we rely so much on your support. With this project we hope to show the world that solar mobility is not just a crazy idea, but it can actually power a vehicle, which can reach even the most remote places.We also know that delays in production and shipment can pose a risk, but we're working on it every day, because we really want to make it.We know we can do it, because we have already done it once before! FAQ What happens with my donation and how will it be handled?Your contribution will be used for materials and parts for the buggy only.How else can I support the project?We will be happy if you tell your family and friends about the project. Additionally, you can share our page on facebook, like and share our youtube videos and spread the word.Why do we have a flexible crowdfunding goal?We aim for 10000€ to be able to build the heart of our buggy, the solar array. Further, we have many other costs in our project and the solar array is just one part of the buggy. That’s why we need any support we can get!What do I get for my money and how do I profit from my investment?Rewards:Of course we only list your name as a supporter on our website if you agree.

we are very grateful to share this with the world.  This campaign is run by an international team collaborating within Richard's Architecture-Design (R A+D), an interdisciplinary architecture and design consultation firm.  We are creating this campaign to raise funds for the North American launch of R A+D 's  development of the MINILOOP in North America.  R A+D has been in operation for 10 years, working with private, commercial, and government sectors in countries around the world on the leading edge of eco-design.  R A+D leader and Principal, Richard Moreta has over 30 years of experience in innovative design and architecture. MINILOOP is an internationally awarded system, winning awards at the Moscow Urban Forum 2017, and the Well-Tech Smart Cities Awards in Milan, Italy in 2017.  MINILOOP is  one of the newest products in the pipeline for development at R A+D, which brings great innovation, sustainability, and renewable energy to our cities worldwide.  MINILOOP is a Vertical Master Plan Transit System, originally designed by Professor and Architect Richard Moreta Castillo, R A+D's founder and owner. It is designed to be a free transit method for commuters, with the options of renting a bike or e-bike, as well as a platform for taxis and delivery services.  The revenue brought in through digital advertisements along MINILOOP will pay for its running and maintenance, as once built, MINILOOP is a completely self-sustaining system energetically with its own renewable energy supply.  Additionally, selling power back to the local grid is another one of MINILOOP's revenue streams, which are explained below.  We have set a goal of $150,000 USD raised for this campaign, which means only 6,000 people have to donate $25 or more for us to reach our goal!  Anything raised in excess if our goal will be greatly appreciated, and utilized responsibly to fulfill our team goals and milestones, as well as provide perks for contributors. Having contributors support us through this crowdfunding campaign will allow for R A+D's developments in North America for MINILOOP, firstly in Silicon Valley and San Francisco Bay Area, as well as the Greater Denver Area. The MINILOOP prototype will be created in facilities in the Greater Denver Area, and will be open for showing first to municipalities, partners and investors, and then to the public. MINILOOP's prototype will be built through conventional and 3D printing construction, using sustainable building materials, making it immensely cost effective and very easy to mass produce quickly.    We at R A+D are here to create innovations for the betterment of humanity and our environment.  Our team comes from all over the planet including the United States, Italy, Bangladesh, Singapore, Germany, Dominican Republic, and more.  Our United States Team will be spearheading and managing the first MINILOOP project and beginning the foundation of MINILOOP's own company, MINILOOP

 First I would like to extend my sincere gratitude to all collaborators from around the world: ISRAEL, US, UK, CHINA, JAPAN, INDIA, GERMANY, ROMANIA and MYANMAR.I myself am a visual artist, a painter and a designer with an interest towards functionality.As a background my father is a master mechanic and electrician, my mother a medic, my grandfather a carpenter and my grandmother a tailor.Since childhood I have reconstructed cars and built many electric vehicles, small cars, boats and airplanes, but nothing for production purposes.   Qlio Velo is the first Safe & Comfortable Pedal Assisted - Self Charging Velomobile in the world.The idea came because there is nothing of this kind in the world, to recharge on the go. I wanted something simple yet comfortable, safe and environmentally friendly. More than that, to be able to fix or replace the components anywhere in the world with very little knowledge of mechanics or electrical engineering. Almost all of the components are off-the-shelf products.This project started 7 years ago and although I already had some mechanical and electrical knowledge, I went back to school to expand my vision.  At the beginning I wanted to built only one model for myself, but the more I talked about it, my friends and family pushed me into creating a production model.Velomobile, why not?Most of the velomobiles on the market are for hobbyists and are mainly man oriented. I wanted something that everyone can enjoy, big or small, young and old.It is built this way so that even my mother, sister or girlfriend to ride in safety and comfort. For many years I have tried to promote different pedal powered vehicles to my mother, but she always pointed out the lack of safety. Qlio Velo is dedicated to both parents and children around the world. It might not be the world's fastest velomobile but it is the safest.Qlio Velo is manufactured using all existing parts to keep production costs low, while ensuring quality.

<h3>OUR Story</h3>
<p>•<span> 
</span>My
name is Dan Wolfe. I have always been an avid biker. I love to spend as much
time as possible on the mountain trails with my biking buddies and when the
trails are snowed in we load our camping gear and travel to other locations where the trails are still
open or we ride the roads as well. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1447198937/rbwyzyvvckefgaso4jyf.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

</span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;background-color: initial;"">We
also are truck lovers and we haul our bikes and all our gear in our pickup
trucks. Over the years we have bought about every variation of truck bed bike
rack on the market, but all of them had numerous problems that we didn't like
to deal with. The wheel removal and clamping and strapping, etc. etc. were
robbing us of precious biking time and causing many other aggravations like
shifting bikes, damage to the truck or the bikes or both. Almost all of the
other racks we tried obstructed cargo space and had to be removed when not
hauling bikes then reinstalled next time. We didn't like having our expensive bikes back in the dust and grit and spray off the road from the trucks wheels. The bikes themselves were in
 the way of loading our camping and other gear. </span><br/></p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;""><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">• So we invented a rack that did away with all of these problems. It became very popular and in demand in our local area. But it was built for only 26 inch mountain bikes and many people wanted a rack that would fit their 29ers or road bikes. Now FAT bikes are cool, but the original ""FastRack"" just didn't work for all of these </span>popular sizes so we reinvented the FastRack.<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> </span></span></p>

</span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;background-color: initial;"">We
have now solved ALL of these problems with the new KURUK Bike Rack. It clamps
in place up on the truck bed side walls just behind the pickup's back window. </span></p>

<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;background-color: initial;"">• It doesn't obstruct bed space so it never needs to be removed in order to load
other gear in the bed. Bikes can be loaded instantly whether other cargo is in
the bed or not. Up to 6 bikes will ride securely on top of the load. No wheel removal,
or clamping, or strapping, or shifting bikes. More bikes can be loaded in less
space. The <b>KURUK rack</b> accepts ALL sizes of bikes and instantly adjusts to
various wheel sizes and grips them like a Chinese hand cuff. If the tire goes flat it still holds tight.</span><br/></p>

<p>•  When we started building our own racks
for our own use in our garages they were pretty crude, but they worked well and
we kept improving on them. Then other bikers started noticing them and asking
us if we could make one for their trucks as well. Before long they became very
popular in the local biking community then we got a website and started getting
orders from all over the country. We continued to make major improvements and
then applied for and got a patent. Now we are ready to make it a real business
and start serving the general biking population. We are determined to keep it
American and create some great jobs here at home. You can be a part of this

<p></p></div>","The Problem

Do you or
someone you know ever haul your bikes in your pickup truck? How do you load
your bikes? How do you secure the bikes? How many bikes can you haul? How about
other gear - do you have to unload other stuff to load the bikes?  

Does your rack have to be removed when not in use? Do your bikes have to ride on a rack behind the vehicle in the spray and dust and grit off the road?



When the bikes are loaded is there any room left to load your camping gear?
Do your bikes bounce around and get tangled and beat each other up and scratch the truck?

Do you have to unload all the bikes to open the tailgate for loading other gear?

How much time does it take to load and unload?

Hauling bikes in your pickup truck poses lots of problems.
The Solution
The KURUK Bike Rack for Pickup Trucks solves all of the problems associated with loading bikes and gear in a pickup.




The KURUK wheel holder instantly adjusts to any bike tire size and clamps it in like a Chinese handcuff. Even if the tire goes flat the KURUK rack synchs up tight.

A fully loaded truck bed is NO PROBLEM for the KURUK rack. Bikes are loaded on top of the load and you can still pull a trailer.

The bikes are up out of the road spray and dust. You still have full access to open the tailgate.

Up to 6 bike capacity on a standard size truck and you can still close the tailgate of a short bed truck even with big bikes.

The KURUK rack loves FAT or SKINNY tires.
OUR Story
• 
My
name is Dan Wolfe. I have always been an avid biker. I love to spend as much
time as possible on the mountain trails with my biking buddies and when the
trails are snowed in we load our camping gear and travel to other locations where the trails are still
open or we ride the roads as well. 


• 
We
also are truck lovers and we haul our bikes and all our gear in our pickup
trucks. Over the years we have bought about every variation of truck bed bike
rack on the market, but all of them had numerous problems that we didn't like
to deal with. The wheel removal and clamping and strapping, etc. etc. were
robbing us of precious biking time and causing many other aggravations like
shifting bikes, damage to the truck or the bikes or both. Almost all of the
other racks we tried obstructed cargo space and had to be removed when not
hauling bikes then reinstalled next time. We didn't like having our expensive bikes back in the dust and grit and spray off the road from the trucks wheels. The bikes themselves were in
 the way of loading our camping and other gear. 
• So we invented a rack that did away with all of these problems. It became very popular and in demand in our local area. But it was built for only 26 inch mountain bikes and many people wanted a rack that would fit their 29ers or road bikes. Now FAT bikes are cool, but the original ""FastRack"" just didn't work for all of these popular sizes so we reinvented the FastRack. 


• 
We
have now solved ALL of these problems with the new KURUK Bike Rack. It clamps
in place up on the truck bed side walls just behind the pickup's back window. 

• It doesn't obstruct bed space so it never needs to be removed in order to load
other gear in the bed. Bikes can be loaded instantly whether other cargo is in
the bed or not. Up to 6 bikes will ride securely on top of the load. No wheel removal,
or clamping, or strapping, or shifting bikes. More bikes can be loaded in less
space. The KURUK rack accepts ALL sizes of bikes and instantly adjusts to
various wheel sizes and grips them like a Chinese hand cuff. If the tire goes flat it still holds tight.



• 2 million bikers in the US haul their bikes in their trucks. We have
done the research and proven that the KURUK rack has large market appeal, but
the tooling up and manufacturing of the KURUK Rack is an expensive project. We
are just regular guys with regular jobs and don't have the cash to make it
happen without your help.

Pickup trucks are meant to
haul things yet hauling our bikes in our truck beds has been a pain in the

Our primary goal was getting these bikes to a price-point that competed with even non electric bikes.  Even with all the trials we faced during our<a

Your Wait is Over.

Ever since the launch of Stark Drive and for those that went on to read our Master Plan, our launch of Stark Drive Torque has been on their minds and our inbox.  After many prototypes, hard work, and unrelenting dedication from our team we are officially ready to launch the NEXT GENERATION of Stark Drive with the most powerful motors and longest range to date.  It's our pleasure to bring this to all of you and get performance never seen at this level of affordability.
 
Meet the Founder of Stark Drive Oscar StarkCurrently living in Stockholm, Sweden, Oscar created Stark Drive in 2016 out of his own frustrations in getting an affordable electric bike in the capital of Scandinavia.  In a goal of democratizing, affordable electric transport his team set out to create an ultra affordable e-bike that was portable to fit in tight spaces.  Our primary goal was getting these bikes to a price-point that competed with even non electric bikes.  Even with all the trials we faced during our initial campaign, we persevered and shipped thousands of bikes worldwide.  Then we went on to introduce the first mass produced electric bike you could take with you on a plane for even less than the cost of Stark Drive.  Oscar is relentless in his tenatious drive to innovate and bring the latest electric bike advancements to everyone at a price they can afford.   This time we are bringing you two bikesStark Drive Torque: catered for any regions that have restrictions on the maximum watts that your electric bike may be restricted to at 250WANDStark Drive Torque Max: a fat tire version which is meant to go full-on with the maximum amount of power legally allowed in regions such as the USA at 750W*.  (*upgradable to 1000w).Either way, Stark Drive Torque is much more than an upgrade to the original Stark Drive it's a paradigm shift away from the delightfully antiquated and ubiquitous hub motor driven electric bikes to the future standard torque based mid motor drives which are more efficient, provide more torque, and are more responsive than any hub motor based electric bikes.  Let us Introduce: STARK DRIVE TORQUE. And of course: STARK DRIVE TORQUE MAX Stark Drive Torque will be available in our standard Matte Black and Matte White while Stark Drive Torque Max will be available in Matte Black, Matte White and Neon Orange.Stark Drive Torque has been designed completely from the ground up including the frame as no such frame existed that could accommodate our specially selected BAFANG mid motor drives used on Stark Drive Torque.  While many companies take existing open mould frames and simply customize the components on the bike, as we have in our first campaign, we knew that we had to think outside the box in order to get Mid-Motor based Torque Drive technology on the streets.Which Stark Drive Torque is RIGHT for you?No matter what you're looking for, there is a perfect Stark Drive Torque For you!What about Dimensions?STARK DRIVE TORQUE STARK DRIVE TORQUE MAXOur entirely new Stark Drive Torque has a much more powerful motor with up to 750W of power.  We have also upgraded the power system with up to a 48V Battery that has also been redesigned from the ground up to include a high power 10W USB output allowing you to take the battery with you and use it as a power station wherever your rides may take you.  Even our base model Stark Drive Torque includes a motor that outputs 80Nm of torque which is comparable to 750W Hub motors and totally legal in the EU and Australia.  Torque Max includes the Bafang Ultra Max motor at up to 1000W outputting a jaw-dropping 160Nm of torque.  We've have included the best Shimano 8-speed gearing with easy to use 'rapidfire' shifters.  We are also using the latestcomputer displays available from our Supplier Bafang with backlighting standard.  There is also the option to upgrade Stark Drive Torque to a new SMART backlit FULL COLOR LCD display.  for only $99 USD (199 USD Value).  Light sensing technology to automatically turn your front and rear lights on based on the lighting conditions is standard across the board. All Stark Drive units always include the most state of the art metal foldable pedals to help Stark Drive Torque Fit in the tightest of spaces.Due to the sheer power of Stark Drive Torque, we have upgraded the brakes across the lineup to provide you with more stopping power at the drop of a dime.  We also decided that the only way that we could ensure complete customizability for your ride, we needed to forgo spring based suspension for the state of the art Air Suspension technology with 9 levels of suspension at the turn of a lever as well as the ability to adjust the amount of air in the suspension providing you an unlimited number of suspension options.In term of Securing Stark Drive Torque, we decided that the best way to go was Fingerprint Recognition Technology letting you unlock Stark Drives power system with your finger and the ability to register hundreds of fingerprints so that you can share Stark Drive Torque with the family and your lucky friends.  Stark Drive Torque will also have the option to forgo a fingerprint and instead use NFC to unlock.  Stark Drive Torque will also include wireless charging so you don't have to worry about carrying around and managing any USB cables to keep your Qi enabled mobile phone topped up no matter how long your ride.Stark Drive Torque is exclusively using Bafang as our motor supplier with two motors of choice being the M400 and M620M400M620
