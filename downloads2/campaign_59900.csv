<p><em><strong>Help End the Pain…</strong></em></p>
<h1>Lichen Sclerosus Hurts in Many Ways</h1>
<h2>Announcing a formal study of new method to treat Lichen Sclerosus.</h2> <p>Hello,</p>
<p>If a woman breaks her arm, then her friends come visit and offer comfort. </p>
<p>If a woman suffers with painful sex, then she does not talk to her friends--often she does not even talk with her lover or physician!  Unfortunately, if she suffers with pain because of lichen sclerosus, even if she talks with her physician, she may not find healing.  </p>
<p><b><i>So, if she suffers with painful sex from Lichen Sclerosus, she suffers alone...often for years with often permanent unwanted changes to her vagina.</i></b></p>
<p>The pain from both physical dis-ease and from social problems can cause her so much ""severe distress"" that it can seriously interfere with her life (JAMA 1999).</p>
<p>As the inventor of <a href=""http://oshot.info"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the O-Shot (R) procedure</a>, I've talked with over 4,000 women about their sexual problems...and unfortunately, <b>this is an area of research that has been underfunded for many reasons.  </b></p>
<p>We <a href=""http://www.oshot.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/openaccess.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">just published this research about ways to use the woman's own blood-derived growth factors to heal sexual pain (click here).</a>  That project (which cost about $50,000) was completely funded out of the pockets of the authors because not one company would help fund the research--even the companies that make the lab equipment we used to do the procedure.  </p>
<p><b><i>There' so much stigma around sexual medicine that companies fear it will hurt their reputation to be involved.</i></b></p>
<p><b><i>Thankfully, the p<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">reliminary results done by us and others shows that the same technology we've used for the O-Shot (R) procedure can be used to treat lichen sclerosus in women who have been resistant to treatment and so have suffered for years.</span></i></b></p>
<p>Unfortunately, since there is no drug involved (we use platelets centrifuged from the woman's own blood), there is no huge budget from a drug company to fund our research.</p>
<p>Dr. Andrew Goldstein will be leading a research project to find a better treatment for resistant lichen sclerosus.  The following links explain the research project. <b><i>Please consider helping fund the project.  No drug company will help, and there is no government funding.  </i></b></p>

Lichen Sclerosus Hurts in Many Ways
Announcing a formal study of new method to treat Lichen Sclerosus. Hello,
If a woman breaks her arm, then her friends come visit and offer comfort. 
If a woman suffers with painful sex, then she does not talk to her friends--often she does not even talk with her lover or physician!  Unfortunately, if she suffers with pain because of lichen sclerosus, even if she talks with her physician, she may not find healing.  
So, if she suffers with painful sex from Lichen Sclerosus, she suffers alone...often for years with often permanent unwanted changes to her vagina.
The pain from both physical dis-ease and from social problems can cause her so much ""severe distress"" that it can seriously interfere with her life (JAMA 1999).
As the inventor of the O-Shot (R) procedure, I've talked with over 4,000 women about their sexual problems...and unfortunately, this is an area of research that has been underfunded for many reasons.  
We just published this research about ways to use the woman's own blood-derived growth factors to heal sexual pain (click here).  That project (which cost about $50,000) was completely funded out of the pockets of the authors because not one company would help fund the research--even the companies that make the lab equipment we used to do the procedure.  
There' so much stigma around sexual medicine that companies fear it will hurt their reputation to be involved.
Thankfully, the preliminary results done by us and others shows that the same technology we've used for the O-Shot (R) procedure can be used to treat lichen sclerosus in women who have been resistant to treatment and so have suffered for years.
Unfortunately, since there is no drug involved (we use platelets centrifuged from the woman's own blood), there is no huge budget from a drug company to fund our research.
Dr. Andrew Goldstein will be leading a research project to find a better treatment for resistant lichen sclerosus.  The following links explain the research project. Please consider helping fund the project.  No drug company will help, and there is no government funding.  
Please help Dr. Goldstein find the answer.

The World-Wide Impact
 Dr. Goldstein has successfully completed multiple studies in the area of vulvodynia. We will get this research done to the benefit of millions of women worldwide and to the benefit of their families.

  Risks & Challenges Though the preliminary evidence shows this could be a cure for many women for whom there is no cure (and some of them go on to develop squamous cell carcinoma as part of the disease), we have no guarantee that the treatment will cure all women.  
Still, even if it cures 30-50 percent of women who previously had no way to find relief, that would be a huge breakthrough.
Other Ways You Can Help

<p>Our relationship started through a Facebook poke in February of 2012 and we finally met in Brazil in April and, as he lives in Toronto and we didn't want to be apart I came to visit him, but we didn't have the means to buy health travel insurance for this period and also as I have always been in excellent health, I didn't expect anything to happen in such a short time.</p>
<p>On December 15 of 2012, we got married at City Hall in Toronto and started organizing ourselves for the application to change my status in Canada before January 20, when my current visit permission expires and, be able to continue our lives together and happy.</p>
<p>To our surprise, on January 1, 2013 at 1:30pm I started feeling a strong pain in my lower abdominal area. I thought it was from bad food, but after two hours in huge pain and almost losing consciousness, I perceived there was something more serious. We tried to use Aspirin to kill the pain but that didn't work. I started to vomit and pass out. As the health is most important I went to the Emergency Ward of Toronto General Hospital. There they told me about how much it would cost for me for not having health insurance.</p>
<p>After my assessment and some additional testing I was informed I would need emergency surgery to take out my appendix and that I had only a few hours to do it before it would explode and become a much worse situation. That meant I couldn't go to Brazil to do the surgery there for free as a Brazilian.</p>
<p>Then, considering I wanted to live, we did the surgery. The procedure went without complication and my recovery is going very well and quickly.</p>
<p>If I had access to the health Insurance of Ontario, all the procedures would have been covered at no extra cost, including the days at the hospital. But, in my case, I was charged for each day ($3500/day) plus cost of all the exams and also the surgical procedure itself (Doctors fees, anesthesia, etc.).</p>
<p>I arrived at the hospital on Tuesday in the afternoon and left on Thursday in the afternoon.</p>
<p>My visa doesn't allow me to work, then, my husband, who is a freelance musician, is the only responsible for the expenses and, now we don't have any possibility to pay this entire bill.</p>
<p>We have yet to receive the bills from the hospital and separate bills from the doctors. We expect the total medical bill to be about CA$ 25.000,00, money I have never seen in front of me.</p>
<p>That's why I'm here asking for help. I'm shy and sorry but I don't know what to do to help my husband and continue being happy with him here.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hello, my name is Rhonda. Life can change in the blink of an eye as was proved to me a few weeks ago when my daddy, my hero, was diagnosed with Congestive Heart Failure.  I am starting this campaign in an effort to help my daddy raise money to help cover the medical expenses he has incurred and will incur as part of his treatment for Congestive Heart Failure (CHF). My dad is only 46 so if he gets the care he needs chances are in his favor for making a great comeback. Unfortunatly daddy has no insurance and with only 20% of his heart working, he is unable to work. He cannot get medical assistance unless he receives his disability which will likely take months and purchasing insurance is highly expensive. Your dontations will help my daddy relieve some of the stress these medical expenses are causing and also will help him be able to continue to receive the care he needs for a full recovery. Doctors expect he will need heart surgery and a pacemaker by Februray if his heart is strong enough for him to undergo the surgery at that time.

Hello, my name is Rhonda. Life can change in the blink of an eye as was proved to me a few weeks ago when my daddy, my hero, was diagnosed with Congestive Heart Failure.  I am starting this campaign in an effort to help my daddy raise money to help cover the medical expenses he has incurred and will incur as part of his treatment for Congestive Heart Failure (CHF). My dad is only 46 so if he gets the care he needs chances are in his favor for making a great comeback. Unfortunatly daddy has no insurance and with only 20% of his heart working, he is unable to work. He cannot get medical assistance unless he receives his disability which will likely take months and purchasing insurance is highly expensive. Your dontations will help my daddy relieve some of the stress these medical expenses are causing and also will help him be able to continue to receive the care he needs for a full recovery. Doctors expect he will need heart surgery and a pacemaker by Februray if his heart is strong enough for him to undergo the surgery at that time. He will continue to need medications to build up his heart, control his blood pressure, and keep fluid retention at bay until he is able to receive the surgery he needs.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
</div>
<div>Imagine waking up one day and suddenly you can't say more than 1-2 words to speak. You can think in sentences, but when you speak--only ""um"" or ""I"" comes out. Maybe nothing comes out. Maybe you speak normally--at least you think you do--what other people hear is gibberish. Maybe you keep repeating the same thing over and over again, such as ""deedle deedle"" with different intonation, thinking you are communicating. What is wrong with everyone else that they can't understand you?</div>
<div> </div>
<div>You can no longer read books or magazine. You can't read your email. You may find that you can recognize that there are written words there, you may recognize a few of them, but you have no idea what it says. You can't use the computer. The keyboard looks very strange to you.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>One side of your body may not work now. You can feel sensation, but you can't move your leg or your arm. One side of your face may droop, making it harder to eat and to speak clearly. You can't balance, hold a pen in your hand, or dress yourself. You can't balance to go to the bathroom by yourself.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>You realize people are talking to you--asking you questions or telling you to do things--but why can you only understand a few words of it? How are you supposed to respond? The whole word suddenly speaks a language you don't understand. They speak it quickly and without gestures, so it's confusing and upsetting. </div>
<div> </div>
<h3>
<strong>What is going on?</strong> </h3>
<div>You have aphasia.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>
<a href=""http://www.theaphasiacenter.com/2012/01/what-is-aphasia/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Aphasia</a> is a disorder that can occur when someone has a stroke or head injury. Aphasia can happen to any age, race, nationality, or socioeconomic class, and it has devastating effects on those it touches. The person can no longer read, write, speak effectively or understand everything said to them. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>But you can get better. There are intensive aphasia programs that can help you and your loved ones learn to communicate better. Too bad insurance doesn't cover it and you can't afford it.</div>
<div>
<p>The Aphasia Center provides<a href=""http://www.theaphasiacenter.com/what-is-intensive-aphasia-treatment/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""> intensive treatment</a> to persons affected by aphasia. We are a small company doing big things, and it's expensive to provide this service. We want to help each family that comes here as much as we can in the time given, but we don't have backing from any hospital or university to help offset costs. For 25 hours each week, we provide hope, encouragement, support, education, and major changes to persons with aphasia. We want to make an impact on each life here, but we can't afford to give away the treatment. </p>
<div>By contirbuting to our campaign today,  you will help to provide scholarships to people who have no funds for treatment. Insurance doesn't cover this treatment, even though there are over 25 years of research supporting it. These are people who may be able to return to work with a little help and training, or people who are retired but can't talk on the phone, email, write, read, or speak well enough to socialize in the community or with their friends.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Someone told me a long time ago that trying to raise money for aphasia would be a waste of time. The idea was that ""no one cares about old people with aphasia"". I know that this isn't true, and aphasia doesn't just happen to ""old people"". I know that lots of people care.</div>

</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need contributions to pay for scholarships for people with aphasia who need intensive treatment. Once you've lost your job, you dont have insurance--you don't have income. Eventually you end up with Medicare, but it doesn't cover much treatment. Unless you have a large savings account, you're just watching TV for the rest of your life.</p>
<p>What if you just needed a little boost to get back to work and to your life? How do you find the money? What if your child has aphasia?</p>
<p>We plan to use this money to help us provide scholarships and to spread it around to families with aphasia as much as possible. What that means is that instead of ten families getting full scholarships, our goal is to use these funds to give as many people as possible some support. While families will still have to commit to funding some portion of their treatment, we can provide that crucial funding to get them treatment.</p>
<p>We have a big committment to what we're doing and how we're doing it. </p>
<p>We are working for the families who need intensive treatment and who desperately need our help. </p>

It was a five year long battle, that we never thought would happen to us. The series of doctors, running to and from appointments, to exams and treatments left all of us physically exhausted for years. The random hospital stays, when a cold, turned into pneumonia, meant another several weeks of overdrive. We pitched in, and we juggled the best we could, trying to keep everything else non-cancer related running smoothly. The emotional toll, filled with misguided hope that radiation, chemotherapy, or a lobectomy (a surgical procedure performed to remove one of the lobes of the lungs),  would save my dad, changed all who loved him. Lung cancer is a disgusting and degrading disease, that stole pieces of my dad every day, little by little, until there was nothing left. I do not wish this on anyone. Possibly if Vapor was available, my father may have been able to quit smoking as easily as I did. <br/><br/><b>The Problem</b></p><p>I am not alone in this, according to the World Health Organization July 2013:</p><p></p><ul>
<li>Tobacco kills up to half of its users.</li>
<li>Tobacco kills nearly 6 million people each year.

Unless urgent action is taken, the annual death toll could rise to more than eight million by 2030.</li>
<li>Nearly 80% of the world's one billion smokers live in low- and middle-income countries.</li>

The K10 Vapor CouncilFuture . . . Charitable Organization 501c3I am calling on other concerned people in the Vaping Community to join me in the formation of The K10 Vapor Council.For those of you who have never started a 501c3 I will briefly outline the process. First we must establish a group of volunteers who want to aid in the establishment of this council. We will use Google Hangouts to have a monthly video meeting. 1) Create Constitution and By Laws 2) Incorporate 3) One year of Meeting Minutes (annual, monthly, weekly, we decide) 4) Apply for 501c3 status 5) Celebrate the new 501c3 Charitable Organization (I have done this before. The process is easy when you know the steps.)The Board Of Directors7 officers & voting members, plus 3 alternates, for a total of 10 people.Board Member OfficersPresident, Vice President, Treasurer (Corporate), Treasurer (Membership), Secretary (Corresponding), Secretary (Recording), Parliamentarian, Board Member 1 Retailer, Board Member 2 Supplier Manufacturer or Distributor, Board Member 3 Community Member  This group will create the Constitution and By Laws for this corporation, and are signing on for a two year commitment to work with The Vapor Council from Constitution & Incorporation until 501c3 designation.Mission Statement: The Vapor Council is an independent organization of people, committed to fighting for fair Vapor regulations and legislation. We agree in a cooperative approach between, manufacturers, distributors, retailers and users, to create a safe and respectful vaping community.  5% of All Sales from Grandpa's Vapor Store will directly support the Vapor Council.The Vapor Council, like all good organizations, will be a place to grow and evolve with its members.

<p>Turn your smartphone into a tool that tracks tree disease outbreaks and deliver forest health data to scientists and forest managers around the world.</p>
<p><strong>Why TreeTaggr</strong></p>
<p>Forests cover one-third of the total land area on our planet. Yet millions of hectares of native forests are under threat each year by a host of new stresses induced by climate change, including a growing number of pests, diseases, pollutants. Certain species such as the once-dominant chestnut and elm have been virtually wiped out by invasive disease.</p>
<p>So the fight is on to save the eastern hemlock, ash, and the suddenly vulnerable conifer stands from both native and non-native pests and diseases. And with the TreeTaggr app you can join the fight!</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“There is no more pressing need than the need to preserve our trees, for our earth, and ourselves.  Any way we can help gather information on the health of trees must be embraced. TreeTaggr is a much needed tool for researchers and citizens who, together, are fighting to save our forest trees.” – Lori Knowles, Health Law Institute, Canada</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Developed by the Institute of Forest Biotechnology, the TreeTaggr app uses the camera and geolocation functions on a smartphone to ‘tag’ unhealthy trees in a healthy forest, or, alternatively, healthy trees in an unhealthy stand.  This app is the first tool that would leverage the availability and connectivity of smartphones for forest health data collection. It would allow a user to walk into a forest, photograph a tree, add details about the tree, and send the information to a geographic database.  The user can then note the tree type, if the tree appears diseased or healthy, and add other observations.</p>
<p>The app would incorporate a game aspect to further encourage people to explore forests and notice tree health. Points will be given to the user as he or she identifies and explores more forests. (Points for exploring – how great is that!)</p>
<p>Our goals for this phone app are two-fold: 1) to get the public interested and engaged in gathering forest health information for analysis, and 2) generate forest health trend information that can help curtail disease spread in forests. Anyone interested in promoting healthy forests – such as foresters, hikers, conservationists, citizen scientists, educators, and anyone else with a smartphone who cares about trees are all potential users.</p>
<p><strong>The TreeTaggr App:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Automatic detection of the user’s location when making a report.</li>
<li>Ability for the user to enter information about the tree affected by disease or a parasite.</li>
<li>Attach photographs that will help the scientists evaluate the tree’s health.</li>
<li>Upload the collected information to a geolocation database.</li>
<li>Display leaderboard information so users can play while making reports.</li>
</ul><blockquote>
<p><em> “From a certain perspective TreeTaggr is simple. It is basically a ‘crowd sourced’ data collection tool for tracking the spread of tree disease within and across forests.  But TreeTaggr is also a harbinger for something much bigger. TreeTaggr portends a new way of thinking about scientific research and a new way of thinking about volunteerism.” – Neil Hepburn, PwC, Canada</em></p>

<li>Database designed and built – Microsoft Azure with Geolocation</li>
<li>Web-driven API – Communication conduit between database, website, and phone</li>
<li>Android phone application scoped in detail</li>
</ul><p>We have a fully scoped software development proposal that includes all the details and features we have spent the last year brainstorming. This will give us a full-featured beta version of TreeTaggr in hand. We have been fortunate to have some really amazing pro-bono help to get us to this point (We know a guy). With the beta version complete, we will have a product ready to be used, tested and expanded to other smartphone platforms. We can begin gathering ‘tags,’ get feedback from beta-testers, and add finishing touches to the app. Any funds raised beyond the $20,000 goal will be used to develop the user interface for the website, and expand the app to additional phone platforms such as iOS and Windows.</p>
<p>Because The Institute of Forest Biotechnology is a non-profit 501-c-3 organization, the majority of your donation (89% in fact) is tax-deductible.</p>
<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<p>Your smartphone has all the tools necessary to help improve forest health. The TreeTaggr platform has been built from the ground up to give you, your friends, family, colleagues, and anyone else with a smartphone and a passion for forests the ability to create robust, actionable, scientific research.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em> “Treetaggr is a great way to engage not only citizen scientists, but everyone else who uses our forests and wants to keep them healthy for generations to come. This tool will help people understand the threats to our forests on a real-time and local scale, while at the same time getting better regional scale information to forest managers.” – Michael Rodemeyer, University of Virginia, USA</em></p>

<h2><strong>Short Summary</strong></h2>
<p>In 2009 I had never heard of the Medical Biomagnetic Pair Therapy, but it came into my life and literally CURED me of a chronic digestive problem overnight that had been bothering me for years. I immediately knew I had found my mission in life!</p>
<p>This year in October I celebrated my 7th year as a Biomagnetic Specialist helping thousands of people overcome pain and suffering. This great healing journey pushed me to write books, and I just finalized my 6th and most revolutionary book which teaches people like you how to use magnets at home, because the fact is that the world needs it, and gaining access to a therapist like me is virtually impossible for the billions of people on earth. </p>
<p>The wonderful people currently using my system are reporting more mental clarity, easier time solving problems, overall sense of optimism, energized, pain relief and more. One gentleman even told me he avoided an Emergency Room visit when after a 10 minute magnet application the abdominal pain disappeared; all of this without harmful side effects or risk of injury.</p>
<h2>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h2>
<p>We are at the production stage and making the minimum order to get magnets delivered costs $4,753 due to the engineering of special molds</p>
<p>Our perks allow you to also get access to the great benefits of our Biomagnetic System</p>
<p>Every little bit of your donations go into the development and marketing of our system.</p>
<h2>The Impact</h2>
<p>When you contribute on our Election Day Magnetic Blitz day, you are also voting for Biomagnetism, and helping to make our world a better place:</p>
<p>We are providing safe and natural pain relief solutions that can't possibly harm you or poison you</p>
<p>Many testimonials are pouring in, but I'm greatly impressed that someone was able to avoid an emergency room visit using this system</p>
<p>We miss 100% of the shots we don't take, so why not give these magnets a try?</p>
<h2>Risks &amp; Challenges</h2>
<p>There are zero risks and challenges.  Pioneering Biomagnetism is my life and every moment of my life is dedicated to making sure everybody on earth experiences this science. </p>
<p>Since 2009 I have helped thousands overcome pain and suffering and have written several books </p>
<p>This system is the most revolutionary of them all because it teaches, in layman's terms, a very simple and effective approach</p>

</div></div>","We are a team of cross-cultural people who have responded to the basic need of having to ingeniously provide comfort and safety to people in public  and private spaces when people cough or sneeze and may potentially spread germs or infections that cause diseases and various sicknesses when the respiratory outputs from them coughing or sneezing suspends in the air for people to inhale or when it drops on surfaces that that further transmit diseases.

 
The prevalence of diseases in time past through respiratory infections have accounted for epidemics and pandemics that have caused losses of loved ones and incapacitation of many with huge lost resources and economic disability for people globally.
A review of an MIT research

 
Preliminary data of respiratory diseases that the implementation of the SneezeBox can prevent is revealed below :


Our campaign is one for which we seek your participation on the global front so that we can habitually prevent the spread of sicknesses through the use of the SneezeBox in a way that reduces the incidences of infections that cost people lives and resources.


 
SneezeBox structural features :

As a game changer...

 


 We understand that there are other seeming materials that people  use but these are very ineffective.




 
 



 
 


 

  
                                                 



 


 



 

                                                   

 

 



This campaign is very important to us because it will give us the required resources to get our product to where it can be seen and more orders can be made by most groups of people who want to prevent prevalence of Pandemics/Epidemics or Sicknesses that make family members feel unwell or loose their lives.

 
Our solution is cheap effective, Eco-friendly, Foldable, portable and fashionable
 




 
            


                                           


 





 
Contributions will first help us get you to use our product for which we know you will be delighted to make direct orders afterwards. The will then translate to our product being able to make it to very important markets and regions where the Winter season may bring sicknesses.
These regions will find the SneezeBox useful as the prevalence of hospital visits will be prevented and loss of lives will be averted, especially with speculations that the COVID-19 pandemic may return. Your contributions will ensure the product is available for us to respond accordingly to respiratory infections in a way that we are not held down any longer again and people will never have to deal with the loss of their loved ones to diseases that the SneezeBox can prevent.

<p>This isn't one of those KickStarter campaigns that asks for $20,000 and then ends up raising $100,000.

Unlike KickStarter, any and all money given towards Boos for Gideon will go directly to mom and dad - even if the goal isn't met.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My goal is to raise enough money for mom and Gideon to be able to have 4 sessions with the lactation specialist at $130 a pop. $5, $10, $20, $500, $2,000 - whatever you have in your heart and/or wallet and/or bra and/or socks and/or mattress will be much appreciated!</p>

At $130 a session, I am trying to raise enough money for 4 consultant sessions. If Gideon catches on quicker than that, let me assure you there is no shortage of things that mom and dad could use the extra money for as first-time parents.

If you're paying attention, you must have realized that $130 * 4 is not equal to $600. You sir, are correct. Indiegogo takes between 4%-9% and credit card transactions tack on an additional 3%, so I figured those fees into the fundraising goal.

You Can Help
This isn't one of those KickStarter campaigns that asks for $20,000 and then ends up raising $100,000. Boobs for Gideon might not even make it's $520 goal - but don't let that stop you from giving! Unlike KickStarter, any and all money given towards Boos for Gideon will go directly to mom and dad - even if the goal isn't met.

My goal is to raise enough money for mom and Gideon to be able to have 4 sessions with the lactation specialist at $130 a pop. $5, $10, $20, $500, $2,000 - whatever you have in your heart and/or wallet and/or bra and/or socks and/or mattress will be much appreciated!

Do it for Gideon.

We received many emails and phone calls from people wanting to visit our facility even months after the gym had already closed! There are still many people interested in learning parkour. The demand is there but most people shied away when they finally heard the news about our gym.

Being on Team Freedom provided us with professional opportunities such as stunt work for movies, commercials and live performances, as well as teaching classes, workshops and holding jams (giant training sessions) with the local parkour community.Unfortunately, the gym closed because of a leasing issue, leaving the community damaged and without a home to unite all of the Michigan parkour/freerunning communities. We received many emails and phone calls from people wanting to visit our facility even months after the gym had already closed! There are still many people interested in learning parkour. The demand is there but most people shied away when they finally heard the news about our gym. Many people feel uncomfortable trying to learn in an outdoor environment. We have followed the fiery passion that is inside of us all and our team has risen from the ashes of our old gym to feed the flame that is burning deep in our hearts. We have never given up on each other. Our goals have never been set aside. Teaching outdoor classes can be dangerous in certain conditions, such as rain, extreme heat or in the winter cold.  Regardless of all the things we have had to overcome, we kept our promise to provide the public with the most professional parkour and freerunning training in Michigan. We experienced a REBIRTH and became PHOENIX!

</p><p><b>Introduction</b></p>
<p>
</p><p>
Hey Guys! My name is
Eric (user “RP Iron Man” on the RepRap forums) and I have been actively involved in the RepRap community for over a year. Before I became involved in entrepreneurial work, I worked at a staging company where I did Carpentry, Welding, CAD Design, CAM, CNC Programming, and Industrial CNC Operation. I also did significant Project Management on $8000 projects for real world clients with tight deadlines. Eventually I quite this job and started to focus on turning my RepRap hobby into a business. I took an immediate interest in hot end design as I saw the need for many improvements. </p>
<p>
</p><p>
As our 3D printing community
continues to explore new boundaries, exciting high-temperature
plastics like Polycarbonate and Nylon are becoming widely available.
As a result, RepRappers are replacing their old PEEK insulated
J-Heads with new all-metal hot ends that are capable of printing at
these high-temperatures. With a plethora of new hot end designs, all-metal hot ends are
becoming the ubiquitous all-in-one solution for RepRap 3D printers
around the world. 
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
Despite these recent
innovations, I have noticed that the new all-metal hot ends have the
same static design features of a fixed ""melt-zone"",
""transition-zone"", and thermistor position. While these new
designs satisfy the need for reliable high-temperature extrusion,
they seem to ignore the fact that users may require different hot end
parameters for their specific needs or simply for experimentation. 
</p>
<p>
</p><p>It
didn't seem like anyone else had solved this problem yet so I decided
that I would take on this project. Finally, after months of
designing, three generations of prototypes, and hundreds of hours of
printing, the Prometheus Hot End was born!</p><p></p><p></p><p><br/></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><b></b></p><h4><b></b></h4><p>
</p><p><b>Modular
Design</b></p>
<p>
</p><p>The
modular design of the Prometheus Hot End consists of three custom
designed and precision CNC-machined components: the Aluminium Heat
Sink, the Aluminium Heater Block, and the 1-Piece Stainless Steel
Nozzle. Every component of the Prometheus Hot End was carefully
engineered for optimum performance.</p><p></p><p></p><p><br/></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><h4><b>Aluminium
Heat Sink</b></h4><p><b></b></p><p><b><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/410759/files/20140304141749-IMG_1410.JPG?1393971469"" src="""" style=""""/></b></p><p></p><p></p><p>The
Aluminium Heat Sink is
precision CNC-machined and polished for a beautiful surface finish.
Aluminium was chosen as the material for the heat sink due to its
high thermal conductivity and high machinability. The heat sink
incorporates a standard groove mount design for compatibility with
standard extruder bodies. Fins
are turned into the heat sink to maximize cooling and symmetrical
faces are milled on each side to allow a 25mm cooling fan to be
mounted directly to the heat sink. This design feature eliminates the
plastic fan duct, decreases mass, and increases cooling efficiency. 
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The
heat sink is also threaded from top to bottom to allow the 1-Piece
Stainless Steel Nozzle to be threaded into the heat sink and fastened
at the bottom with an aluminium hex nut. A
PTFE tube is inserted from the top and meets
with the nozzle
in the threaded portion of the heat sink to facilitate a low friction
filament path into the nozzle.

</p>
<p>
</p><p>*Note:
This PTFE tube is inserted in the “cold-zone”
of the hot end in the actively-cooled
heat sink so it is NOT
subjected to high temperatures.</p><p><br/></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><h4><b>Aluminium
Heater Block</b></h4><p><b><b></b><b></b><b></b><b></b></b></p><p><b><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/410766/files/20140304142026-IMG_1419.JPG?1393971626"" src="""" style=""""/></b></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>The
Aluminium Heater Block is
precision CNC-machined and polished for a beautiful surface finish.
Aluminium was also chosen
as the material for the heater
block due to its high thermal
conductivity and high machinability. The
Aluminium Heater Block is simply designed with a 5.5mm
hole for the heater, two thermistor mounting holes, an
M6 thread, and a
top-to-bottom threaded hole for the 1-Piece
Stainless Steel Nozzle. The
nozzle
is threaded through the top and secured with an aluminium hex nut.
Additional aluminium hex nuts
can be fastened against the
heater block to customize the
“melt-zone” length. 
</p><p></p><p>The
heater is a 12V 30W through-hole resistor heater and
the thermistor is a Semitec
100K glass bead thermistor which measures up to 300C. The heater
block features an additional thermistor hole which
is useful if you want to add
a second “redundant” thermistor for added reliability. Note that
the heater block pictured above has been slightly revised according
to the technical drawings below so both thermistor holes are sized to
fit the Semitec 100K glass
bead thermistor. 
</p>
<p></p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/469491/files/20140329133102-Aluminium_Heater_Block_V1__5mm_.jpg?1396125062"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>I
have recently made some slight adjustments to the heater block in
order to improve a few details of the design. I think the most
important improvement is that
the thermistor will no longer
be secured to the heater
block by Kapton Tape.
Wrapping Kapton Tape around
the heater block is a messy, unreliable, and unattractive way to
secure the thermistor so I really wanted to do away with this
approach. 
</p>
<p>
</p><p>While
discussing this with a few people on the forum, Brian
(RepRap user “bstott”) suggested this method to secure the
thermistor leads. As
illustrated in the technical drawing above, a
cap
screw with a small OD washer
secures the thermistor leads
and eliminates the possibility of the thermistor falling out. This is
a significant improvement to both the reliability of the thermistor
and the aesthetic appeal of the hot end. The
M6 threaded hole also allows for a future upgrade to standard M6
threaded thermocouples. All
hot end perks will ship with this improved heater block design.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><br/></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><h4><b>1-Piece
Stainless Steel Nozzle</b></h4><p><b></b></p><p><b><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/410770/files/20140304142133-IMG_1430.JPG?1393971693"" src="""" style=""""/></b></p><p></p><p>The
1-Piece
Stainless Steel Nozzle is
precision CNC-machined and
polished for a beautiful surface finish. Stainless
Steel was chosen as the material for the 1-piece nozzle due to its
low thermal conductivity, low
thermal expansion, and high
strength. This design
replaces the standard nozzle and heat break combination in most
all-metal hot end designs with a 1-piece nozzle that eliminates
all internal
""melt-zone"" junctions. 
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Internal
""melt-zone"" junctions are
the leading cause of leaks and clogs in conventional hot end designs.
Molten plastic can leak through the junction or can get stuck in the
junction, decompose, and the
charred
remains
can then flow down and clog the nozzle orifice. I
have experienced these problems even with the best hot end designs.
With my 1-piece nozzle/heat-break design I have completely eliminated
all internal “melt-zone” junctions and thus eliminated the
possibility of ""melt-zone"" related leaking or clogging.
With several hundred hours of
printing and not a single leak or clog, the empirical results speak
for themselves.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In
addition to the 1-piece design, I was meticulous about custom
burnishing the internal
pathway of the nozzle to avoid
the possibility of the filament jamming. Filament jamming is
the most significant problem
associated with
all-metal hot ends. While hot
end “clogging” relates to the obstruction of the nozzle orifice,
hot end “jamming” is associated with the forces involved in
filament extrusion. In order to extrude filament successfully, the
applied force of the extruder drive must be greater than the opposing
force of friction.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Friction
occurs most prominently in the “transition-zone” of the hot end
where the plastic is changing from solid, to rubbery, to liquid. The
plastic remains solid in the ""cold-zone"" until it is heated above its Glass
Transition Temperature (Tg) in the ""transition-zone"" at which point it is ""rubbery"" until it is heated
above its Melting Temperature (Tm) and turns to liquid in the ""melt-zone"". In
its “rubbery” state at temperatures between Tg and Tm, the
plastic turns soft and expands to form
a plug in the “transition-zone”.
This plug of soft rubbery plastic
is the most significant source of friction in the hot end and
is the leading cause of hot end jams. 
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The
standard J-Head hot end design features
a low friction PTFE
liner that extends the full
length of the “transition-zone”
and greatly reduces
the friction caused by this
plug. However,
all-metal hot ends do not have a PTFE lined “transition-zone” so
friction becomes a significant issue especially when
printing PLA. To overcome
this problem I custom
burnished
the full length of the
internal bore
of the nozzle. The burnishing
procedure polishes
the internal pathway of the
nozzle to a near mirror
finish ensuring that it is
smooth enough to eliminate
jamming.</p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/410791/files/20140304142647-IMG_1424.JPG?1393972007"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><b><br/></b></p><h4><b>Customizing
the “Melt-Zone”, “Transition-Zone”, and Thermistor Position</b></h4>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
Introducing the
""melt-zone"" length, ""transition-zone"" length, and
thermistor position as fully customizable variables is what makes the
Prometheus Hot End truly unique. The ""melt-zone"" and
""transition-zone"" length are two of the most significant
design features of a hot end which govern the extrusion behavior
while the position of the thermistor greatly influences the thermal
control of the ""melt-zone"". In conventional hot ends these
design features remain fixed and are optimized for a specific need,
which allows for very little flexibility and experimentation. The
Prometheus Hot End was designed specifically as a flexible platform
that would enable RepRap users to experiment with the effects of
different ""melt-zone"", ""transition-zone"", and
thermistor configurations on the extrusion behavior. 
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
The Prometheus Hot End
was purposely designed so that these three parameters could be
adjusted as easily as possible. The “melt-zone” can be lengthened
simply by threading additional aluminium hex nuts against the heater
block. As a result, the position of the thermistor in the “melt-zone”
is user-customizable based on how you position the heater block and
additional hex nuts on the nozzle. The “transition-zone” is
easily set by increasing the distance between the heat sink and the
heater block. 
</p>

of a Customizable Design</b></p>
<p>
</p><p>
The ""melt-zone""
length, “transition-zone"" length, and thermistor position are
three key parameters that govern hot end performance so enabling
user-customization of these features has some important implications.
While this customizable hot end design allows for some interesting
experimentation, it also allows each user to customize the
performance of the hot end according to their specific needs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
<b>The
</b><b>“transition-zone""</b>: Enabling a customizable
“transition-zone"" length allows the user to set a very short
(2mm-3mm) “transition-zone"" to increase the reliability and
extrusion response of the hot end. The length of the
“transition-zone"" governs the length of the soft rubbery
“transition-zone"" plug which is the most significant source of
friction in the hot end and is the leading cause of hot end jams.
This plug also increases hysteresis (slower extrusion response time)
when extruding at very low flow rates. Configuring a short
“transition-zone"" decreases the length of this plug and
therefore increases reliability and extrusion response of the hot
end.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
<b>The </b><b>“</b><b>melt-zone</b><b>""</b>:
Having a user-customizable ""melt-zone"" is arguably the most
significant advantage of this customizable design since the
requirements for ""melt-zone"" length vary considerably
between applications. The length of the ""melt-zone""
determines the volume of molten plastic in the hot end and therefore
is responsible for the amount of “ooze”, extrusion response,
retraction response, and maximum feed rate of the hot end. A shorter
""melt-zone"" means less molten plastic in the hot end and
results in less “ooze”, faster extrusion response, and more
effective retractions at the expense of a lower maximum feed rate. A
longer ""melt-zone"" means more molten plastic in the hot end
and results in a higher maximum feed rate at the expense of more
“ooze”, slower extrusion response, and less effective
retractions. Consequently, a short ""melt-zone"" would be
ideal for printing detailed objects at lower extrusion rates, while a
longer ""melt-zone"" would be the better configuration for
high speed printing.</p>
<p>
</p><p><b>The
</b><b>t</b><b>hermistor
</b><b>position</b>:
Customizing
the position of the thermistor in the ""melt-zone""
is
also a useful feature of this flexible hot end design. The
thermistor position determines the accuracy of the temperature
reading and the thermal response of the hot end. Generally,
there are a few causes of heat loss in the ""melt-zone"":
heat loss due to thermal radiation of the aluminium parts, heat loss
through the “transition-zone”
to the actively cooled “cold-zone”,
heat used to melt the plastic entering the ""melt-zone"",
and
heat transferred to the extruded plastic at the nozzle tip. Most of
the heat is dissipated at the top of the ""melt-zone""
so it is a good idea to configure the thermistor
position at the top of the
""melt-zone""
to ensure that the temperature is sustained especially at high feed
rates. However, if you are printing very detailed items at low feed
rates and you are more concerned with very accurate temperature
readings at the nozzle tip you may want to configure the thermistor
position at the bottom of the
""melt-zone"".
In either case, the
entire ""melt-zone""
is aluminium (highly thermally conductive) so the thermal hysteresis
within the ""melt-zone""
is not much of an issue at all.

</p><p><b>Performance
Expectations</b></p>
<p>
</p><p>
Throughout my testing, the Prometheus Hot End has performed very
reliability and has demonstrated admirable precision in the prints
that it has produced. However, note that my testing results may not
reflect the performance of this hot end in every possible 3D printer
configuration considering the differences in each printer setup. 
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
While I am confident
that this hot end will meet all of your expectations I would like to
remind everyone that this new design (like most all-metal hot ends)
is still considered “experimental” so at this point I cannot yet
guarantee any performance standard.</p>

</p><h4><b></b></h4><p><b>Risks</b></p>
<p>
</p><p>
There are always risks
associated with scaling a product from prototype to mass production.
In order to minimize these risks, I have split the production plan
into two stages: Early Bird production and standard production. The
Early Bird production run will commence soon after the campaign
begins and will be completed before the standard production starts.
In the unlikely case that there is a defect in product quality it
will be detected in the Early Bird production stage. This minimizes
the risk and allows me enough time to make corrections in the event
that something does go wrong. This precautionary measure will help
support the success of this project under any circumstances.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To
ensure that I can effectively carry out this project, I have
dedicated a lot of time to
finding reliable suppliers. I have assured the quality of all of the
products and I have selected backup suppliers as an
additional precautionary
measure. I have worked with my suppliers
for a long time and we have a very good relationship. I am confident
that the quality of the parts will be top-notch. In
addition, my suppliers have a very large manufacturing facility so
scaling up production to meet increased demand should not be an
issue.</p><p><br/></p>

</p><p><b>Fulfillment</b></p>
<p>
</p><p>Design
engineering, prototyping, and testing are just the first few stages
of the project. The perk fulfillment is as important as any stage of
the project and requires just as much forethought. The
project timeline I listed above should give me more than enough time
to fulfill the perks. I deliberately exaggerated the shipping date in
case I encounter any delays with production. Based on my planning, I
firmly believe that I will be able to meet the dates on the
fulfillment timeline. However,
note that there is always a possibility that the perks will be
shipped later than the assigned date.

This
new hot end design allows RepRap users to experiment with all aspects
of thermoplastic extrusion. Its actively cooled all-metal
construction is very durable and can easily withstand the high
temperatures required for extruding thermoplastics like Nylon and
Polycarbonate, while its unique modular design enables the user to
customize the ""melt-zone"" length, “transition-zone""
length, and thermistor position according to their needs. 


This
compact, reliable, and precise hot end is the all-in-one solution for
your 3D printer!

*Select
your perk on the right and help make the Prometheus Hot End a
reality!TestingTo ensure reliable precise performance the Prometheus Hot End has been tested extensively. Prometheus has printed successfully for hundreds of hours in PLA, ABS, Polycarbonate, and Nylon on several Prusa I2 printers without any leaks, clogs, or jams. All testing was done with a 16mm “melt-zone” length and 2-3mm “transition-zone” length.I have tested the Prometheus Hot End with various high stress printing scenarios without any issues: I have printed PLA at very low extrusion rates for long periods of time; I have printed Polycarbonate at 300C above a 140C heat bed in an enclosed print chamber; I have tested rapid successive retractions and 10+ hour long prints. I have also tested the Prometheus Hot End with the lowest quality PLA on the market. I had an old roll of neon green ESUN PLA that had been left in an uncontrolled environment throughout a very hot and humid summer in Toronto. It was wavy and swollen yet I still managed to print a decent looking Yoda head and Bhudda bust at 100 microns without any issues!In addition to its admirable reliability, Prometheus has demonstrated great precision in the prints that it produces. I have managed to print down to 50 microns on my wobbly Prusa I2 printers! Most of my test objects were printed at 100 microns with amazing results that easily match objects I printed with my E3D hot end. YouTube: On my YouTube Channel you can watch several videos of the Prometheus Hot End printing PLA, ABS, Polycarbonate, and Nylon 618. Below you can watch a short video of Prometheus printing a Zig-Zag Vase in Nylon 618 at 200 microns (sorry for the poor audio quality):Flickr: On my Flickr Photostream you can view over 300 pictures of objects that Prometheus has printed. The pictures below are a few examples of objects I have printed with Prometheus.*Keep in mind that ALL of these objects were printed on my wobbly old Prusa I2 printers. If I can get these results on my old printers, just imagine how well Prometheus will perform on a rigid Prusa I3, Mendel 90, or Solidoodle!


Introduction


Hey Guys! My name is
Eric (user “RP Iron Man” on the RepRap forums) and I have been actively involved in the RepRap community for over a year. Before I became involved in entrepreneurial work, I worked at a staging company where I did Carpentry, Welding, CAD Design, CAM, CNC Programming, and Industrial CNC Operation. I also did significant Project Management on $8000 projects for real world clients with tight deadlines. Eventually I quite this job and started to focus on turning my RepRap hobby into a business. I took an immediate interest in hot end design as I saw the need for many improvements. 


As our 3D printing community
continues to explore new boundaries, exciting high-temperature
plastics like Polycarbonate and Nylon are becoming widely available.
As a result, RepRappers are replacing their old PEEK insulated
J-Heads with new all-metal hot ends that are capable of printing at
these high-temperatures. With a plethora of new hot end designs, all-metal hot ends are
becoming the ubiquitous all-in-one solution for RepRap 3D printers
around the world. 



Despite these recent
innovations, I have noticed that the new all-metal hot ends have the
same static design features of a fixed ""melt-zone"",
""transition-zone"", and thermistor position. While these new
designs satisfy the need for reliable high-temperature extrusion,
they seem to ignore the fact that users may require different hot end
parameters for their specific needs or simply for experimentation. 


It
didn't seem like anyone else had solved this problem yet so I decided
that I would take on this project. Finally, after months of
designing, three generations of prototypes, and hundreds of hours of
printing, the Prometheus Hot End was born!



Modular
Design

The
modular design of the Prometheus Hot End consists of three custom
designed and precision CNC-machined components: the Aluminium Heat
Sink, the Aluminium Heater Block, and the 1-Piece Stainless Steel
Nozzle. Every component of the Prometheus Hot End was carefully
engineered for optimum performance.


Aluminium
Heat SinkThe
Aluminium Heat Sink is
precision CNC-machined and polished for a beautiful surface finish.
Aluminium was chosen as the material for the heat sink due to its
high thermal conductivity and high machinability. The heat sink
incorporates a standard groove mount design for compatibility with
standard extruder bodies. Fins
are turned into the heat sink to maximize cooling and symmetrical
faces are milled on each side to allow a 25mm cooling fan to be
mounted directly to the heat sink. This design feature eliminates the
plastic fan duct, decreases mass, and increases cooling efficiency. 


The
heat sink is also threaded from top to bottom to allow the 1-Piece
Stainless Steel Nozzle to be threaded into the heat sink and fastened
at the bottom with an aluminium hex nut. A
PTFE tube is inserted from the top and meets
with the nozzle
in the threaded portion of the heat sink to facilitate a low friction
filament path into the nozzle.



*Note:
This PTFE tube is inserted in the “cold-zone”
of the hot end in the actively-cooled
heat sink so it is NOT
subjected to high temperatures.


Aluminium
Heater BlockThe
Aluminium Heater Block is
precision CNC-machined and polished for a beautiful surface finish.
Aluminium was also chosen
as the material for the heater
block due to its high thermal
conductivity and high machinability. The
Aluminium Heater Block is simply designed with a 5.5mm
hole for the heater, two thermistor mounting holes, an
M6 thread, and a
top-to-bottom threaded hole for the 1-Piece
Stainless Steel Nozzle. The
nozzle
is threaded through the top and secured with an aluminium hex nut.
Additional aluminium hex nuts
can be fastened against the
heater block to customize the
“melt-zone” length. 
The
heater is a 12V 30W through-hole resistor heater and
the thermistor is a Semitec
100K glass bead thermistor which measures up to 300C. The heater
block features an additional thermistor hole which
is useful if you want to add
a second “redundant” thermistor for added reliability. Note that
the heater block pictured above has been slightly revised according
to the technical drawings below so both thermistor holes are sized to
fit the Semitec 100K glass
bead thermistor. 

I
have recently made some slight adjustments to the heater block in
order to improve a few details of the design. I think the most
important improvement is that
the thermistor will no longer
be secured to the heater
block by Kapton Tape.
Wrapping Kapton Tape around
the heater block is a messy, unreliable, and unattractive way to
secure the thermistor so I really wanted to do away with this
approach. 


While
discussing this with a few people on the forum, Brian
(RepRap user “bstott”) suggested this method to secure the
thermistor leads. As
illustrated in the technical drawing above, a
cap
screw with a small OD washer
secures the thermistor leads
and eliminates the possibility of the thermistor falling out. This is
a significant improvement to both the reliability of the thermistor
and the aesthetic appeal of the hot end. The
M6 threaded hole also allows for a future upgrade to standard M6
threaded thermocouples. All
hot end perks will ship with this improved heater block design.


1-Piece
Stainless Steel NozzleThe
1-Piece
Stainless Steel Nozzle is
precision CNC-machined and
polished for a beautiful surface finish. Stainless
Steel was chosen as the material for the 1-piece nozzle due to its
low thermal conductivity, low
thermal expansion, and high
strength. This design
replaces the standard nozzle and heat break combination in most
all-metal hot end designs with a 1-piece nozzle that eliminates
all internal
""melt-zone"" junctions. 


Internal
""melt-zone"" junctions are
the leading cause of leaks and clogs in conventional hot end designs.
Molten plastic can leak through the junction or can get stuck in the
junction, decompose, and the
charred
remains
can then flow down and clog the nozzle orifice. I
have experienced these problems even with the best hot end designs.
With my 1-piece nozzle/heat-break design I have completely eliminated
all internal “melt-zone” junctions and thus eliminated the
possibility of ""melt-zone"" related leaking or clogging.
With several hundred hours of
printing and not a single leak or clog, the empirical results speak
for themselves.

In
addition to the 1-piece design, I was meticulous about custom
burnishing the internal
pathway of the nozzle to avoid
the possibility of the filament jamming. Filament jamming is
the most significant problem
associated with
all-metal hot ends. While hot
end “clogging” relates to the obstruction of the nozzle orifice,
hot end “jamming” is associated with the forces involved in
filament extrusion. In order to extrude filament successfully, the
applied force of the extruder drive must be greater than the opposing
force of friction.

Friction
occurs most prominently in the “transition-zone” of the hot end
where the plastic is changing from solid, to rubbery, to liquid. The
plastic remains solid in the ""cold-zone"" until it is heated above its Glass
Transition Temperature (Tg) in the ""transition-zone"" at which point it is ""rubbery"" until it is heated
above its Melting Temperature (Tm) and turns to liquid in the ""melt-zone"". In
its “rubbery” state at temperatures between Tg and Tm, the
plastic turns soft and expands to form
a plug in the “transition-zone”.
This plug of soft rubbery plastic
is the most significant source of friction in the hot end and
is the leading cause of hot end jams. 


The
standard J-Head hot end design features
a low friction PTFE
liner that extends the full
length of the “transition-zone”
and greatly reduces
the friction caused by this
plug. However,
all-metal hot ends do not have a PTFE lined “transition-zone” so
friction becomes a significant issue especially when
printing PLA. To overcome
this problem I custom
burnished
the full length of the
internal bore
of the nozzle. The burnishing
procedure polishes
the internal pathway of the
nozzle to a near mirror
finish ensuring that it is
smooth enough to eliminate
jamming.Customizing
the “Melt-Zone”, “Transition-Zone”, and Thermistor Position




Introducing the
""melt-zone"" length, ""transition-zone"" length, and
thermistor position as fully customizable variables is what makes the
Prometheus Hot End truly unique. The ""melt-zone"" and
""transition-zone"" length are two of the most significant
design features of a hot end which govern the extrusion behavior
while the position of the thermistor greatly influences the thermal
control of the ""melt-zone"". In conventional hot ends these
design features remain fixed and are optimized for a specific need,
which allows for very little flexibility and experimentation. The
Prometheus Hot End was designed specifically as a flexible platform
that would enable RepRap users to experiment with the effects of
different ""melt-zone"", ""transition-zone"", and
thermistor configurations on the extrusion behavior. 



The Prometheus Hot End
was purposely designed so that these three parameters could be
adjusted as easily as possible. The “melt-zone” can be lengthened
simply by threading additional aluminium hex nuts against the heater
block. As a result, the position of the thermistor in the “melt-zone”
is user-customizable based on how you position the heater block and
additional hex nuts on the nozzle. The “transition-zone” is
easily set by increasing the distance between the heat sink and the
heater block. 



The pictures below
illustrate various ""melt-zone"", ""transition-zone"",
and thermistor configurations that are possible with the Prometheus
Hot End.CZ = ""Cold-Zone"" Length
TZ = ""Transition-Zone""

MZ = ""Melt-Zone"" Length
TP = Thermistor PositionAdvantages
of a Customizable Design


The ""melt-zone""
length, “transition-zone"" length, and thermistor position are
three key parameters that govern hot end performance so enabling
user-customization of these features has some important implications.
While this customizable hot end design allows for some interesting
experimentation, it also allows each user to customize the
performance of the hot end according to their specific needs.


The
“transition-zone"": Enabling a customizable
“transition-zone"" length allows the user to set a very short
(2mm-3mm) “transition-zone"" to increase the reliability and
extrusion response of the hot end. The length of the
“transition-zone"" governs the length of the soft rubbery
“transition-zone"" plug which is the most significant source of
friction in the hot end and is the leading cause of hot end jams.
This plug also increases hysteresis (slower extrusion response time)
when extruding at very low flow rates. Configuring a short
“transition-zone"" decreases the length of this plug and
therefore increases reliability and extrusion response of the hot
end.


The “melt-zone"":
Having a user-customizable ""melt-zone"" is arguably the most
significant advantage of this customizable design since the
requirements for ""melt-zone"" length vary considerably
between applications. The length of the ""melt-zone""
determines the volume of molten plastic in the hot end and therefore
is responsible for the amount of “ooze”, extrusion response,
retraction response, and maximum feed rate of the hot end. A shorter
""melt-zone"" means less molten plastic in the hot end and
results in less “ooze”, faster extrusion response, and more
effective retractions at the expense of a lower maximum feed rate. A
longer ""melt-zone"" means more molten plastic in the hot end
and results in a higher maximum feed rate at the expense of more
“ooze”, slower extrusion response, and less effective
retractions. Consequently, a short ""melt-zone"" would be
ideal for printing detailed objects at lower extrusion rates, while a
longer ""melt-zone"" would be the better configuration for
high speed printing.

The
thermistor
position:
Customizing
the position of the thermistor in the ""melt-zone""
is
also a useful feature of this flexible hot end design. The
thermistor position determines the accuracy of the temperature
reading and the thermal response of the hot end. Generally,
there are a few causes of heat loss in the ""melt-zone"":
heat loss due to thermal radiation of the aluminium parts, heat loss
through the “transition-zone”
to the actively cooled “cold-zone”,
heat used to melt the plastic entering the ""melt-zone"",
and
heat transferred to the extruded plastic at the nozzle tip. Most of
the heat is dissipated at the top of the ""melt-zone""
so it is a good idea to configure the thermistor
position at the top of the
""melt-zone""
to ensure that the temperature is sustained especially at high feed
rates. However, if you are printing very detailed items at low feed
rates and you are more concerned with very accurate temperature
readings at the nozzle tip you may want to configure the thermistor
position at the bottom of the
""melt-zone"".
In either case, the
entire ""melt-zone""
is aluminium (highly thermally conductive) so the thermal hysteresis
within the ""melt-zone""
is not much of an issue at all. 

Performance
Expectations


Throughout my testing, the Prometheus Hot End has performed very
reliability and has demonstrated admirable precision in the prints
that it has produced. However, note that my testing results may not
reflect the performance of this hot end in every possible 3D printer
configuration considering the differences in each printer setup. 



While I am confident
that this hot end will meet all of your expectations I would like to
remind everyone that this new design (like most all-metal hot ends)
is still considered “experimental” so at this point I cannot yet
guarantee any performance standard.





Open-Source
Design

Of
course, I could not have created the Prometheus Hot End without the
help the RepRap community. Browsing
the RepRap wiki, reading RepRap forum threads, and
discussing various hot end designs with other forum members
has
taught me so much about the intricacies of hot end engineering.

I
hope that I can help refuel innovation within RepRap by making the
technical drawings of the Prometheus Hot End available to everyone. I
am releasing the Prometheus Hot End design under the Creative
Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License
(CC BY-NC-SA 3.0). The drawings are
available here on
my Flickr Photostream so
feel free to check them out!Recently
we have also been having some detailed discussions about the design
features of this hot end on the RepRap Fourms so if you are
interested in reading into this you can check out this thread.


Why
Indiegogo?

In
order to mass produce the Prometheus Hot End at
a reasonable price, there are
Minimum Order Quantities (MOQ)
that must be met.
I can make small orders with
my own savings but in order
to have the components mass
produced efficiently I need to
meet the MOQ of my suppliers. Soon
after this campaign begins, I am going to make
the initial Early Bird order
from my suppliers for the Prometheus Early
Bird kits
to ensure that I can have the
Early Bird
kits shipped out on time. Your
support will help me meet (and hopefully far
surpass!) the
requirements to begin mass
production. Your help
will also fund
my future
developments. I have many projects that I have on hold and your
support will help bring these future projects to life!


Perks


Once the Campaign is
complete all contributors will be listed in a thank you post on my
website for supporting this project! My website should be up in a few weeks.
This is will give you a general idea of what is included
in the Prometheus Hot End kit perks:
Both the
1.75mm and 3mm Prometheus Hot End perks ship with a 0.4mm
nozzle orifice. I hope to start testing different nozzle orifice
sizes once this campaign in complete.
Please note that the
Prometheus Hot End is currently designed for direct drive
extruders and I don't have an integrated bowden version available
yet. However, you can easily design a plastic bowden coupling adapter
to use Prometheus with your bowden extruder. Weighing just 30g, the
Prometheus Hot End is ideal for high speed printing on a bowden 3d
printer!

Help
support this project by selecting the perk
that you want. Worldwide
shipping is included in the
price of each perk and
if you select a Groove Mount Plate as
an add-on it will ship with
your Prometheus (1.75mm or 3mm) perk.

The
Prometheus Early Bird
perks are priced lower
and ship earlier
than the standard perks. If you want to get
your Prometheus Hot End early
be sure to select this perk. The
quantity
of Early Bird
perks available is
limited so don't wait! 


Note
that the standard perks will be shipped in the order they are
received so be sure to order earlier to receive your perk sooner.
Once this campaign is finished the Prometheus Hot End kits will be
available at a slightly higher price on
my website. I
encourage everyone to take advantage of the discounted prices offered
in this campaign!The payment method is PayPal, which is of course a very safe way to pay!



Timeline

April
2014 ----------

- Launch Indiegogo campaign.- Make first order for Early Bird perks from suppliers.

May
2014 ----------
- Early Bird production in progress.

June
2014 ----------- Campaign ends.- Make second order for standard perks from suppliers.- Ship all Early Bird perks.

July
2014 ----------- Standard production in progress.- Ship all standard perks in the order they are received.


Risks


There are always risks
associated with scaling a product from prototype to mass production.
In order to minimize these risks, I have split the production plan
into two stages: Early Bird production and standard production. The
Early Bird production run will commence soon after the campaign
begins and will be completed before the standard production starts.
In the unlikely case that there is a defect in product quality it
will be detected in the Early Bird production stage. This minimizes
the risk and allows me enough time to make corrections in the event
that something does go wrong. This precautionary measure will help
support the success of this project under any circumstances.

To
ensure that I can effectively carry out this project, I have
dedicated a lot of time to
finding reliable suppliers. I have assured the quality of all of the
products and I have selected backup suppliers as an
additional precautionary
measure. I have worked with my suppliers
for a long time and we have a very good relationship. I am confident
that the quality of the parts will be top-notch. In
addition, my suppliers have a very large manufacturing facility so
scaling up production to meet increased demand should not be an
issue.


Fulfillment

Design
engineering, prototyping, and testing are just the first few stages
of the project. The perk fulfillment is as important as any stage of
the project and requires just as much forethought. The
project timeline I listed above should give me more than enough time
to fulfill the perks. I deliberately exaggerated the shipping date in
case I encounter any delays with production. Based on my planning, I
firmly believe that I will be able to meet the dates on the
fulfillment timeline. However,
note that there is always a possibility that the perks will be
shipped later than the assigned date. 



I will be sure to keep
you informed with regular updates from the start of the campaign to
perk delivery!


Other
Ways You Can Help


Even if you can't afford
to fund my project you can still help! Tell all of your 3D printer buddies about the new Prometheus Hot End and get the word out! Use
the Indiegogo share tools and do anything you can to increase
publicity. Unfortunately, I am not much of a marketing guy and I
don't have many resources for marketing this project so every little
bit of publicity will help make this project a reality.

Thank
you
so much for your support!

Happy
printing :)",15.0,1,"1 Campaign

<h3><strong>Who am I?</strong></h3>
<p>My name is Candice and I am 32 years old. I started practicing yoga approximately six years ago as a way to improve flexibility and help with back pain caused by scoliosis.  I also started training in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu two years ago.  Both Yoga and Jiu-Jitsu have changed my life by giving me inner strength and confidence, and inspiring  me to be the best version of myself. Over the last six years, yoga, and now Jiu-Jitsu, have continued to transform my life, and now I want to help others reach their dreams by finding their own<strong> inner warrior.</strong></p>
<p>I want to help others reach their goals, find focus and stamina in life, and build confidence. Along with beginner and intermediate yoga, I will also teach yoga for Jiu-Jitsu, yoga for kids, senior yoga, prenatal yoga, community yoga, and private instruction to help others attain their personal goals.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>Details</strong></h3>
<p>The teacher training course will cover:</p>
<ul>
<li>Advanced study of asana (proper alignment, benefits and potential risks)</li>
<li>Principles of anatomy</li>
<li>Science and art of sequencing</li>
<li>Hands-on adjustments</li>
<li>How to observe bodies</li>
<li>Informed use of props to improve or modify a posture</li>
<li>Cultivating your voice</li>
<li>Confidence-building through practice teaching</li>
<li>Yoga history and philosophy</li>
<li>Sanskrit names of postures</li>
<li>The Business of Yoga</li>

Hence, we can grow these Ayurvedic medicinal plants indoors, effectively.No Genetically Modified Seeds are used in this projectWhat is hydroponics?Growing of plants in a soil less medium, or an aquatic based environment. Hydroponic growing uses mineral nutrient solutions to feed the plants in water, without soil.No Genetically Modified Seeds are used in this projectThe Problem:We have been disconnected from the ancient knowledge of treating ailments naturally, wherein only herbs and their by-products are used which pose absolutely no side effects. Instead, we opt for chemical alternatives that come with several repercussions tagged along. We believe that rebuilding this connection is vital in addressing the seemingly endless list of concerns in our health. From deforestation to the ever- growing population and the exponential inflation in diseases rate, the choices we make have affects on us individually, and also on Mother Nature cumulatively, which in turn influences the ecosystem negatively.Why iGROW-ElixiR?:Majority of today's population around the world are thriving on ""Highly processed food"" which are comprised of no nutritional value. This has negative impact on our body's immune system. We lose the ability to fight diseases naturally and depend on synthetic drugs.  Our Mission:iGROW-ElixiR is about cherishing ancient knowledge of medicinal plants and imbibing modern technology.  Our mission is to grow maximum number of such plants around us and reap utmost benefits from them. iGROW-ElixiR Kit:iGROW-ElixiR grow system Features & Specification:20-plants cups4 X Grow LED lightsDeodoriser cartridge NFT modular vertical setupHDPE modular enclosure with self-lockIntel Quark Processor2' L X 2' W X 5' H4 Nylon caster wheels15 lbs (When Empty)7.5 litres- water storageBluetooth 4.2 CommunicationTransparent Acrylic cover-4 sides50 watts- power consumption (Full load)11 lbs clay pebbles4 litres- Nutrition cartridgeMedi Plug: Medi Plug Currently Tested & Sold:1.

<p>We started this project because essential oils have changed our lives in some situations, they are very<b> efficient natural well-being solutions</b> and we wondered why so many people didn’t use them.</p>
<p>The reason wasn’t hard to find : over the hundreds of people we interviewed, most of them had actually tried diffusers in the past, before leaving them after an average of 3 uses, because it was too messy &amp; time consuming!</p>

</div>","Lumiere is the smartest essential oil diffuser for well-being at home. 
[FR] Découvrez le projet en français
Press
Even though we are a young startup, some awesome magazines and blog have already spotted us !











Aromatherapy & Our Inspiration
Aromatherapy has natural virtues for well-being; relaxing, energizing, purifying, helping focus, setting a right sleeping atmosphere, or even aphrodisiac, and a lot more.
We started this project because essential oils have changed our lives in some situations, they are very efficient natural well-being solutions and we wondered why so many people didn’t use them.
The reason wasn’t hard to find : over the hundreds of people we interviewed, most of them had actually tried diffusers in the past, before leaving them after an average of 3 uses, because it was too messy & time consuming!
The Product
We created Lumiere so you don't have to remember or use your precious time to take care of the diffuser.





•  Magnify your home with sight & scentsLumiere diffuser and capsules are made with high quality materials and, thanks to its elegant design, will integrate any environment. We worked with renowned French nose to create the finest blends with 100% natural essential oils. •  Be pampered by your smart well-being companion 




Lumiere takes care of you all day long, automatically


Thanks to the built-in intelligence in the smartphone application, Lumiere will understand exactly when a diffusion will be appreciated.So you can wake up with more energy every morning, when your diffuser triggers with the ringing of your alarm clock, or always finding your home with a relaxing atmosphere as you get back from work.

 • Control, change & program your home's atmosphere in a single tap
Even though we automate some useful diffusion, you can turn Lumiere on or off when you want with a single tap on your mobile app. The 4 capsules that you've chosen are detected and displayed on your screen.



Start spreading in a single tap


 •  Enjoy the best essential oils and the best of them with the safest technology



Changing an oil has never been so fast & easy!


We have invented a whole new way of plugging essential oil, and even just scent in a diffuser, it now takes less than a second to set or change a capsule;  it requires no cleaning, no heating, and it's absolutely silent !





Today, two patents have been filed on the diffuser and the capsule.
The App
Lumiere comes with a user-friendly application, available & free for iOS and Android users :






Why Lumiere is better for aromatherapy?
We are using the most efficient & innovative diffusion technology for our diffuser. 
There is a lot of ways to use essential oils and spread them in the air, but we’ve chosen to use a piezo diffusion, here is why:


First of all, it’s a cold diffusion: all the properties of the oils are kept intact for the most efficient aromatherapy benefits.
We’re spreading oils only, there is no water in the whole system. That means once again that the diffusion will be more efficient and it can spread the oils in larger rooms, because water diffusion creates mixed drops with essential oil & water, the drops are heavier and therefore fall within a short range of the diffuser.
Piezo diffusion is totally silent.









Eco-friendliness







Capsules & Refilling
Our capsule range or your own essential oil ? You have the choice ! 
Because we created Lumiere to make everything simpler, we have prepared a range of 10 benefit capsules with our expert partners in Paris. They are 100% natural & organic !
We also know you might like to use your own oils & blends, that you might have a favorite brand that’s making miracles for you. And that’s fine, that’s why we give the possibility to get Lumiere empty capsules, that you can fill & refill yourself !
When you pledge for one diffuser or more, here is the choice you’ll have for your capsules:

</div></div>","Follow 15 sailors as they escort ""Tyler the Monkey"" around the world in support of Tyler Puetz and his fight with cancer.
Tyler Puetz from Regina, Saskatchewan, Canada was diagnosed with a cancerous brain tumor in Sept 2012.  He is currently receiving treatment in Saskatoon with the support of family and friends.
To support Tyler in his battle with cancer, a team of 15 sailors who are currently training to sail around the world in 2013 have joined together and will carry our mascot ""Tyler the Monkey"" around the world.  This race around the world will take almost 12 months to complete and cover 40,000 miles.

The key points of the mission: 

Two Stuffed Monkeys have been donated and will serve as mascots for supporting Tyler.

One Monkey will stay with Tyler as he goes through his treatments and recovery.
The other “Sailing” Monkey will be given to the team of 15 sailors that will escort him around the world and eventually get back to Tyler after the end of the race.
The “Sailing” Monkey will join Heather Reid at the start of Leg 1 in the UK and she will deliver the Monkey to Rio where it will be given to another crew member which will carry it on to Cape Town, then Australia, New Zealand, Singapore, China, San Francisco, Panama, New York, Nova Scotia, Ireland, the Netherlands and back to UK.

Please follow us for updates on the race, our Sailing Monkey, and give your support to Tyler Puetz.
 
We have created this fundraising campaign which will be used to support Tyler and his family to assist with any on going expenses. Please share Tylers story to others.
 
We have also setup a Facebook Page ""SailingAroundtheWorldforTyler"" which will includes Updates on Tylers medical condition and track ""Tyler the Monkey"" as he travels around the world.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p><strong>VegCo Flagship Market</strong></p>
<p>We have chosen to develop the flagship VegCo Market in Phoenix because it is our home and the community is underserved. Currently vegans, vegetarians and flexitarians (meat reducers) in this market must travel to multiple locations weekly to find the foods they want. Several items simply aren't available to the community either because they are not affordable or because they are not stocked in the local grocery stores. Based on a 2011 Vegetarian Resource Group Survey, there are estimated to be over 100,000 vegetarians and vegans within the Phoenix city limits. Our survey of  hundreds of local households has revealed a real desire for a local market that offers super fresh, environmentally conscious foods in a single, convenient location.</p>
<p>This first market will serve as the blueprint for the VegCo model. Based on this market's success, the VegCo concept will be developed in other communities nationally and internationally. Each VegCo Market will adhere to the principles described above, but will be unique and tailored to meet the needs of the community they serve. </p>

<p class=""p1""><strong>DEATHS FROM CHOLERA OUTBREAKS</strong></p>
<p class=""p1"">Every year, over 5 million people suffer from Cholera and over 120,000 of them die from this treatable disease. In Haiti alone, almost 10,000 people have died since the 2010 earthquake and more are dying every day. Our project is to save as many of these people from needlessly dying from Cholera. Why do people die from Cholera when a few saline solution IV bags and antibiotic are all that's needed to prevent death from dehydration? The total cost to treat someone suffering from Cholera can be as little as $20.</p>
<p class=""p2""> </p>
<p class=""p1""><strong>WHY SO MANY DEATHS?</strong></p>
<p class=""p1"">Current IV bags cost only a couple of dollars, but the weight and bulk of pre-filled IV bags makes it costly to ship. Each 1 liter saline IV bags weigh about 2.3 lbs. (38 oz.). In disaster relief efforts, doctors and workers must physically carry supplies to remote areas by foot or on motorcycles thereby limiting the amount of pre-filled fluid bags that they can take with them. Often most NGOs don't bother shipping IV bags to disaster area due to the cost of shipping.</p>
<p class=""p1"">In a nutshell, it's too expensive and inconvenient for the current IV saline bags to reach those who need them the most.</p>
<p> </p>
<center><img alt=""IV Bag"" class=""hoverZoomLink lazy"" data-src=""http://www.fosmomed.com/Graphics/ivbag.jpg"" id=""exifviewer-img-5"" src="""" style="""" title=""IV Bag""/></center>
<p class=""p1""><strong>WHAT WE ARE DOING</strong></p>
<p class=""p1"">Our mission is to eliminate unnecessary deaths due to Cholera. Cholera is a treatable disease striking areas across the globe where clean water is unattainable, where natural disasters have hit hardest and where supplies are limited. We have developed Maji™, an intravenous (IV) saline bag solution that can be shipped without water and filled at the site of care with any available water source creating a sterile saline solution for the treatment of Cholera patients.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>INTRODUCING Maji™</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<center><img alt=""Maji prototype"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.fosmomed.com/Graphics/majinew.png"" id=""exifviewer-img-6"" src="""" style="""" title=""Maji""/></center>
<center></center>
<p class=""p1"">Maji™ is a standard 0.9% saline solution IV bag that is shipped dry and filled with any local water source to create a sterile solution at the site of care. Maji uses intelligent technology called Forward Osmosis (FO) to create sterile solution for use on patients. Each Maji bag weighs about 2 oz. and is shipped virtually flat. </p>
<p class=""p1"">Forward Osmosis is a proven technology which mimics how membranes in nature work, including the human body. The FO membrane draws the water molecules from any water source utilizing ultrafiltration to achieve clean, sterile water. When combined with salt, the clean, sterile water becomes a saline solution suitable for IV and injection applications for patients.</p>
<p class=""p1"">The technology associated with FO is already being manufactured for water purification and extreme drinking water applications. At Fosmo Med, we are bringing this revolutionary FO technology to medical applications in an effort to achieve positive social impact.</p>
<p class=""p1""> </p>
<p><strong>WHAT WE WILL DO WITH THE FUNDS RAISED</strong></p>
<p>The funds we raise through Indiegogo will enable us to produce a large number of Maji™ FO bags, perform critical biological tests and help us prepare for testing needed for FDA submission. We already have several organizations, including Jordan International Aid, ready to test Maji™ FO bags in Haiti and other places around the world affected by Cholera when the bags are available.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, we cannot give Maji™ bags out to the donors as we do have to follow government and medical regulations. However, you can make a huge difference and also participate in helping to save the lives of those affected by Cholera. For larger donations, we will donate Maji™ bags in your name to those who need them through the doctors and workers who are on the front lines in the treatment of Cholera patients. The more you donate, the more bags we can provide for free to these men and women fighting to save lives. </p>
<p>If we do not reach our goal of at least $50,000, we will continue to seek other sources for funding so we can continue our project. Each dollar counts because the more we collect, the more Maji™ FO bags we can produce and test and the faster we can provide these bags to Cholera stricken patients around the world. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>WHY ARE WE DOING THIS PROJECT ON INDIEGOGO?</strong></p>
<p>Why? Simple: we want to help save lives; specifically, we want to eliminate unnecessary deaths from Cholera. We believe that social medical problems, like Cholera, require social action to provide the best solutions. We are confident that we can make a significant difference in the treatment of Cholera and change the current trend of unnecessary deaths.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>OTHER WAYS YOU CAN HELP</strong></p>
<p>If you are interested in helping out with the worldwide Cholera epidemic, please contribute to NGOs, such as <a href=""http://www.jordaninternationalaid.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Jordan International Aid</a>, The American Red Cross, Doctors without Borders or any number of hundreds of disaster relief groups throughout the world.

DEATHS FROM CHOLERA OUTBREAKS
Every year, over 5 million people suffer from Cholera and over 120,000 of them die from this treatable disease. In Haiti alone, almost 10,000 people have died since the 2010 earthquake and more are dying every day. Our project is to save as many of these people from needlessly dying from Cholera. Why do people die from Cholera when a few saline solution IV bags and antibiotic are all that's needed to prevent death from dehydration? The total cost to treat someone suffering from Cholera can be as little as $20.
 
WHY SO MANY DEATHS?
Current IV bags cost only a couple of dollars, but the weight and bulk of pre-filled IV bags makes it costly to ship. Each 1 liter saline IV bags weigh about 2.3 lbs. (38 oz.). In disaster relief efforts, doctors and workers must physically carry supplies to remote areas by foot or on motorcycles thereby limiting the amount of pre-filled fluid bags that they can take with them. Often most NGOs don't bother shipping IV bags to disaster area due to the cost of shipping.
In a nutshell, it's too expensive and inconvenient for the current IV saline bags to reach those who need them the most.
 

WHAT WE ARE DOING
Our mission is to eliminate unnecessary deaths due to Cholera. Cholera is a treatable disease striking areas across the globe where clean water is unattainable, where natural disasters have hit hardest and where supplies are limited. We have developed Maji™, an intravenous (IV) saline bag solution that can be shipped without water and filled at the site of care with any available water source creating a sterile saline solution for the treatment of Cholera patients.
 
INTRODUCING Maji™
 


Maji™ is a standard 0.9% saline solution IV bag that is shipped dry and filled with any local water source to create a sterile solution at the site of care. Maji uses intelligent technology called Forward Osmosis (FO) to create sterile solution for use on patients. Each Maji bag weighs about 2 oz. and is shipped virtually flat. 
Forward Osmosis is a proven technology which mimics how membranes in nature work, including the human body. The FO membrane draws the water molecules from any water source utilizing ultrafiltration to achieve clean, sterile water. When combined with salt, the clean, sterile water becomes a saline solution suitable for IV and injection applications for patients.
The technology associated with FO is already being manufactured for water purification and extreme drinking water applications. At Fosmo Med, we are bringing this revolutionary FO technology to medical applications in an effort to achieve positive social impact.
 
WHAT WE WILL DO WITH THE FUNDS RAISED
The funds we raise through Indiegogo will enable us to produce a large number of Maji™ FO bags, perform critical biological tests and help us prepare for testing needed for FDA submission. We already have several organizations, including Jordan International Aid, ready to test Maji™ FO bags in Haiti and other places around the world affected by Cholera when the bags are available.
Unfortunately, we cannot give Maji™ bags out to the donors as we do have to follow government and medical regulations. However, you can make a huge difference and also participate in helping to save the lives of those affected by Cholera. For larger donations, we will donate Maji™ bags in your name to those who need them through the doctors and workers who are on the front lines in the treatment of Cholera patients. The more you donate, the more bags we can provide for free to these men and women fighting to save lives. 
If we do not reach our goal of at least $50,000, we will continue to seek other sources for funding so we can continue our project.

<h2><strong>Here is a little bit about EB this is what Raymond Suffers From.</strong></h2>
<h2><strong>E<span style=""font-size: small;"">pidermolysis Bullosa is a group of genetic disorders that cause babies to be born with extremely fragile skin layers both externally and internally.

<p><strong><em>Care about the health and wellness of low-income women of color?</em> </strong></p>
<p>Please help us reach our $10,000 goal by May 31! The funds will fully support the fall class (there are currently 35 women in the spring class!) and will allow us the time and space to seek grant fundung.</p>
<p> <strong>100 Women Who Care</strong> is a campaign to fund <strong>Take Back the Trail (<a href=""http://www.takebackthetrail.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.takebackthetrail.com</a>)</strong>, a project started by UT professor Terri Givens with the money she inherited, sadly, from losing both of her paretns to cardiovascular disease.</p>
<p><strong>Take Back the Trail's mission is to expose women of color in East Austin to the tools they need to improve their health, allowing them to take back their hearts, health and communities. Our 8-week, evidence based program incorporates physical activity, nutrition education, and facilitated group discussions that focus on how participants can identify barriers and establish and maintain a healthier lifestyle.</strong><strong> </strong></p>
<p>We’ve all read about racial and ethnic health disparities and the disproportionate impact that heart disease, stroke, cancer, diabetes and high blood pressure have on minorities. A few telling statistics:</p>
<ul>
<li>African Americans have the highest rates of obesity at 44.1%, followed by Mexican Americans at 39.3%.</li>
<li>Compared to whites, diagnosed diabetes rates are 66% higher among Latinos and 77% higher among African Americans.</li>
<li>Infants born to African American women are 1.5 to 3 times more likely to die than those born to women of other races/ethnicities, regardless of income and education level.</li>
</ul>
<p>The causes are a complex mix of community, individual, cultural, and environmental factors. The solutions are complex, too, but we know they must include targeted community-based interventions like <strong>Take Back the Trail (TBTT)</strong>, a local initiative created by athlete, mom, UT professor, and community activist Terri Givens.</p>
<p>Terri started the project with inheritance money after losing several family members to heart disease and stroke. She has funded TBTT entirely out of pocket to date, including two pilot programs in 2012 (both of which yielded valuable data that demonstrate this program WORKS!) and the currently running spring 2013 program, which has more than 30 women participating. Participants from the pilot programs have come back to serve as volunteer mentors, proof that women can make sustainable changes to their health and well-being and inspire others to do the same.</p>
<p>So who else actually cares about East Side women and their health? Can Austin sustain TBTT for the long-haul? <em>We think so!</em> That’s why today we are launching the <strong>100 Women Who Care </strong>campaign. <strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">The goal is to get 100 women to contribute just $100 each for the $10,000 TBTT needs to finish 2013. </span></strong> TBTT recently went under the Southwest Key nonprofit umbrella, so all donations are now tax-deductible. The money raised by <strong>100 Women Who Care </strong>by May 31, the end of the campaign, will allow TBTT some breathing room to focus on completing the spring program and aggressively seeking grant funding for the future.</p>
<p><strong>Will you join us in contributing just $100 to sustain this life-changing program?</strong></p>

I meet new people all of the time!"" This is different. This picture was taken on a Friday night. At approximately 1:15 on Wednesday before, I received the amazing news that I had been approved to donate a kidney to Dennis, a man with failing kidneys and non-hodgkins lymphoma. Wait...it gets better! I was visiting my mom and sister in Broken Arrow (which is also where Dennis lives and approximately 90 miles from my home). No one knew I was going there as it was a spur of the moment decision. We were going to a late dinner at Louie's; a place where we had never eaten together before. I had been telliing my mom about my recent approval for donation, my nerves, the basics involving the procedure, and my need for God to confirm my decision. I knew that He was in the midst of things, but did not know if I was clearly hearing Him. On my drive over, I prayed, asking God for some sort of confirmation. So there we sat at Louie's. Fifteen minutes into our time there, I looked to my left and in walked Dennis. I knew it was him because I had seen him on Facebook. His smile and his face, and the chills that took over my body, all told me that this was what I needed. THIS was my confirmation! What were the odds that I would be a match for him? We aren't related and I'm much smaller than him. Who knew that I would ever donate an organ? I've never been put under anesthesia...and I'm scared to death of needles! Who knew that we would be in THAT restaurant on THAT night? I went to shake his hand, and he denied my handhsake. Instead I received the greatest hug. Ok God, I get it! </div>
<div> </div>
<div> </div>
<div>So June is the month for Operation Kidney Jump. I like to think of my kidney puting on a parahchute and jumping into his body. What? Don't judge! I may actually see that when I'm all drugged up. ""GERONIMOOOOOOOOO!"" Sorry. I had to. :) You may think I'm crazy, but I promise I'm not. You see for me, the surgery doesn't come with much financial impact. I will shed some tears, and will no doubt experience some aches and pains, but my bank account will go largely untouched. Dennis and his family will foot my bill and his. They will walk away with medical debt as well as the uncertainty of what the future holds for them. He has cancer. My kidney will help him with one health hurdle, but I can't give enough of me to take away his cancer. What CAN I do to do more? I want to do MORE! I want to cover his bills. I want to relieve him of that monetary stress and enable him to go forward with his family with one less worry. You can join me in making that happen!</div>
<p> </p>
<p>I don't know where you are financially speaking, and I know there aren't many of us that can pay outrageous medical bills. I DO know that every bit can help Dennis and his family. No money will go to me and my love for shoes and makeup. No money will send my kids to Disneyworld. It will go to something that matters; something that will have a lasting impact on a family's future for generations to come. Because of your support, they will live more! Life is about living and loving one another, so lets show some love to Dennis! </p>

His smile and his face, and the chills that took over my body, all told me that this was what I needed. THIS was my confirmation! What were the odds that I would be a match for him? We aren't related and I'm much smaller than him. Who knew that I would ever donate an organ? I've never been put under anesthesia...and I'm scared to death of needles! Who knew that we would be in THAT restaurant on THAT night? I went to shake his hand, and he denied my handhsake. Instead I received the greatest hug. Ok God, I get it! 
 
 
So June is the month for Operation Kidney Jump. I like to think of my kidney puting on a parahchute and jumping into his body. What? Don't judge! I may actually see that when I'm all drugged up. ""GERONIMOOOOOOOOO!"" Sorry. I had to. :) You may think I'm crazy, but I promise I'm not. You see for me, the surgery doesn't come with much financial impact. I will shed some tears, and will no doubt experience some aches and pains, but my bank account will go largely untouched. Dennis and his family will foot my bill and his. They will walk away with medical debt as well as the uncertainty of what the future holds for them. He has cancer. My kidney will help him with one health hurdle, but I can't give enough of me to take away his cancer. What CAN I do to do more? I want to do MORE! I want to cover his bills. I want to relieve him of that monetary stress and enable him to go forward with his family with one less worry. You can join me in making that happen!
 
I don't know where you are financially speaking, and I know there aren't many of us that can pay outrageous medical bills. I DO know that every bit can help Dennis and his family. No money will go to me and my love for shoes and makeup. No money will send my kids to Disneyworld. It will go to something that matters; something that will have a lasting impact on a family's future for generations to come. Because of your support, they will live more! Life is about living and loving one another, so lets show some love to Dennis!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>I have faith in my fellow man.  I believe that there are enough kind-hearted people out there who will want to help this wonderful human being - I just need to make them aware of the disaster that is about to befall her.  If you can't donate, can you please help spread the word?</p>

<p>My best friend, Suzanne, was diagnosed with colon cancer last year. She almost died and had to have extensive surgery, including a colostomy.  She has had to undergo endless testing and treatment since then and now needs another operation. She has no family.  She has not been able to work because she is so ill and she now has nowhere to turn. She has depleted her savings during this long illness paying medical bills and expenses and now she is about to lose her small apartment.  She desperately needs help to pay her rent &amp; utilities and to buy food for the next three months so she can make it through another surgery. To accomplish this, she needs $6,500 as the surgery recovery will require a wound vac and lots of healing time. I would appreciate any help you could provide for her and I pray you can help her where I cannot. God bless you and thank you for reading this campaign.  I know my friend:  she is the most generous person I have ever met.  She has given so much of herself to helping others.  She works on non-profit projects, such as getting clean water to people who need it.  Now it is she that needs the help of others - a strange position for her to be in because she is usually the one doing the helping.  Please help my friend make it through this next operation so she can hopefully beat this cancer and get back to the business of doing what she loves the most:  helping other people. </p></div>","FINAL UPDATE:

<p>I am Jodie and I am currently studying psychology with the hopes of becoming a clinical psychologist in order to help those suffering from mental illness.</p>
<p>This campaign is very important as part of the funds raised will go towards a project to help tsunami sufferers and those suffering from mental illness. This campaign is extremely important to me as I am extremely passionate about helping those suffering from mental illness as it is something personal to me. Any contributions will help those in Sri Lanka who are suffering from mental illness.</p>
<p> I need £1,500, with £750 going towards the project £550 will go towards flights, £38 for a visa £50 for travel insurance and the rest spending money.</p>
<p>Having personally suffered from mental illness I can relate to and really help those who are suffering, so this is a worthy cause and something I am extremely passionate about doing.</p>
<p>This project is run by SL volunteers. SL volunteers are a community of international and local volunteers, sharing skills and time to contribute to community development in Sri Lanka. SL Volunteers is a growing organisation that is led by students and graduates.</p>
<p>This project is run in partnership with Samutthàna. Samutthàna are the King’s College London resource centre for trauma, displacement and mental health. Samutthàna was established with the help of a grant from CAFOD by volunteers from the UK-Sri Lanka Trauma Group, the Institute of Psychiatry, King’s College London and the South London and Mauldsey NHS Trust. The main aim of Samutthana is to train and support organisations and individuals to respond to the psychosocial needs of trauma sufferers i.e. tsunami survivors and those who have experienced civil-conflict in Sri Lanka.</p>
<p>I currently work part time as a support worker helping those suffering from mental illness and have excelled in doing so, thus have the experience to help those in Sri Lanka.</p>
<p>I have also volunteered within my community with a charity singing group called Funrazers, in which we successfully raised funds for many worthy causes.</p>
<p>So, for five weeks I will be working alongside clinical professionals in order to help and support those suffering from mental illness. This is an extremely worthy cause so any donation would be extremely appreciated.</p>

0,"<div class=""routerContentStory-storyBody"" data-v-1df7bf5a=""""><p>Hello Everyone,<br/><br/> My name is Dylan Bracken and this is the beginning of my campaign to raise the funds for my much needed top surgery. Although I hope you take the time to read this in completion, I’m going to break it down into sections so that you can find the information you care about the most.<br/><br/><strong>About me:</strong><br/><br/> I currently live in Saint Louis, Missouri. Before moving here a year ago, I lived in Kentucky while<br/> attending the wonderful school of Berea College. There I double majored in Asian Studies as well as Women and Gender Studies. I’m excited about returning to school when that opportunity arises but I currently can’t afford that.</p>
<p>I was born and raised in Taiwan and lived there until I moved to Kentucky at the age of 19. My parents are Pentecostal missionaries in Taiwan and have been there for 30+ years. I love them dearly and although we are now estranged and my beliefs differ from theirs, I completely support their work because I know they are trying to do what is good and true in their minds. That is what I am trying to do as well. Every day, I do my best to live honestly. That simply means genuinely caring about the world around me and doing what I can to lend a hand. In a sense, I haven’t given up the calling to be a missionary that my family instilled in me. I’ve simply broadened the scope to make the love and compassion I express more inclusive and available to all, including myself.<br/><br/> One of the biggest steps towards living a genuine life has been accepting me for who I truly am; transgendered. Basically the body I was born with has never matched with my gender identity. It took a while, but over the summer of 2010 I realized and accepted that I was not just a masculine woman but in fact a man. I’ve never looked back and I couldn’t be happier. I’ve legally changed my name to Dylan Avery Bracken and I began hormone replacement therapy (testosterone injections) on April 3rd of this year. I finally feel like I'm seeing myself for the first time in the mirror (insert song from Mulan here) and as of a couple of months ago, due to changes from testosterone, I pass as male almost all the time.<br/><br/><strong>This Campaign:</strong><br/><br/> If I pass as male almost all the time, why do I need surgery? That is an excellent question for those of you wondering. There are three main reasons.  The first is for my physical health. One of the keys to passing has been binding my chest to hide the fact that I have breasts of a noticeable size. I have been binding for over two years now. Even though I've learned how to breathe properly, the constant constriction (it is much like a corset for the upper torso) is now consistently causing me a great deal of back pain. Some days it is almost unbearable. So physically, it is vital that I get this surgery soon. The second reason is for my emotional health.  Having a contoured, male looking chest is the missing link to the healthy body image I want so badly.  Sure, I wouldn’t mind having a more muscular body but that simply comes down to hard work and dedication. Hitting the gym won’t make my boobs go away.  That last reason is practical. In the state of Missouri, in order for my sex to be legally changed, I must have some type of surgery. I'm looking into federal ways around that law, but it's important for me to be recognized legally as the man I am.</p>
<p><strong>The Money:</strong></p>
<p>I have two wonderful jobs. The first is at Shameless Grounds, a coffee shop with a mission to “provide diverse populations access to a non-judgmental, sex-positive, radically-inclusive gathering place.” It has become my second home. My other job is at MacroSun International, a fair trade business that brings artwork from Southeast Asian communities to Saint Louis. I am financially completely on my own and am still struggling to pay off debt from school and my immigration to the USA. I love my jobs and they help me pay my bills, but I can by no means afford this surgery on my own.<br/><br/> The surgery I am raising $7,000 for is a double incision/bilateral mastectomy.  I've done a lot of research and talked to other men who have had this surgery from different doctors and the budget is always the same.  The costs directly connected to the procedure come to a total of $6,000. The other $1,000 will be used to cover the cost of travel, recovery, and my bills while I cannot work immediately following surgery.  My roommate, Kelly, has agreed to help me document where every dollar donated goes. She works for the city of Saint Louis’ Homeless Services Department and park of her job is to review how housing providers allocate the funds they receive. After the surgery, I will publish the record so that everyone can see the results of their generosity.</p>
<p>I've included some perks because perks are fun. Feel free to redeem something with your donation. If there is something you believe I have to offer that is not listed, message me and we can work out something specific. If you can donate more than the listed amount, it is greatly appreciated. All of the costs assoiciated with the perks will come out of my own pocket and not be deducted from any donations. I wanted to offer more but with my financial situation, I had to keep them reasonable. </p>

Whether you prefer ice or heat, the recovery cuff does both, and all fully integrated within the gradient compression cuff. PATENT PENDING  Cuff Measurements
Riixo was founded with one goal: To help people be better. Improve sport recovery and performance.Reduce pain after injury & prevent it from happening again.    No seams: Stronger design & equal gradient compressionThe seamless design means there are no weaknesses in the cuff. No pockets, pouches or straps that can rip or tear. This also ensures the compression remains constant - use after use.   Custom insulated caseEach cuff comes in a custom designed, insulated, hard shell case which helps keep the cuffs frozen for up to 5 hours.   YOU FOCUS ON YOUR PERFORMANCE, WE’LL FOCUS ON YOUR RECOVERY

  Improve your performance by speeding up your recovery. Reduce muscle soreness and lactic acid build-up so you can consistently train and compete at your highest level.Train – Recover – Perform  What the Riixo Recovery Cuff can do  CompareWe are Riixo, and we want to challenge outdated and overpriced recovery equipment.  Recovery equipment should not be elitist, it must be for everyone. Let’s start the revolution. We want to make high-performance recovery products affordable, easy to use and supported by evidence and we will start with the Recovery Cuff.     Cuff Temperature DataExtend the use of the cuff with the double insulated case   Features & Awards  Fitted design for gradient compression
 Freezes in 2 hours and stays frozen for up to 5 hours  Heats in the microwave in 15 seconds    Founder's Story.Riixo was founded by Cameron Johnston in 2017 on his return from peace keeping operations with the United Nations working as a physiotherapist. A former professional rugby player, turned physiotherapist, he has two degrees; Sport Science BSc (Hons) and Physiotherapy BSc (Hons).  In 2007 Cameron fractured his spine whilst playing rugby. After a year of rehabilitation, he dedicated the next 10 years working to help people who found themselves in a similar position. He has seen, first hand, the impact an injury can have on someone through his time in the UK health services, with professional sports teams, and most prominently during his seven years in the British Army.  Whilst on operations with the United Nations, in South Sudan, his frustrations grew at the substandard equipment available for recovery. With the primary focus being on the high-end manufacturer he routinely saw equipment with a direct dependency on electricity, water and ice as well as a large price tag.  Cameron returned with one goal in mind, to show the world how it should be done and how it could be done. Recovery from sport and injury is not just for the elite.
3 IN 1
The Riixo recovery cuff can provide heat or ice fully integrated into a cuff that provides calculated gradient compression to the muscles.  
Cool Box Each recovery cuff comes with a custom designed insulated box. This box keeps the cuff cool for up to 5 hours, allowing you to use it on the go.  Antibacterial Fibre Made with fibres ionised with silver particles to prevent the growth of bacteria.  
Easy To Use Freeze the whole cuff in a domestic freezer or heat in the microwave. 
Built To Last. Complete unit, no pockets, pouches or straps so there is nothing to rip or tear. What else is in the box Wash Bag. Designed for the easy cleaning and care of the cuff.  Slip SleeveTo help you to quickly pull on the compression cuff. This thoughtful extra was developed after feedback from athlete use.   ExtrasIce Ball. An innovative mobility tool that combines the benefits of cryotherapy and massage for a great new form of recovery. Simply place the Ice Ball in the freezer for two hours to allow up to six hours of uniquely chilled, free-rolling, recovery massage. Its compact size allows you to conveniently target muscle soreness, knots and joint pain.RRP £24Indiegogo Price £18 -25%  Product development""I had the idea for the recovery cuff whilst deployed on operations, in Central Africa, with the United Nations. I was working as a physiotherapist providing injury rehabilitation in a field hospital on the edge of the desert. ""I have spent three years manufacturing and testing different materials and designs to come up with the perfect solution.  A compression cuff that can be frozen or heated up without the use of a direct electricity source or the need for ice or water.""I have been involved in every step of the design and testing process. Utilising detailed feedback from demanding athletes, clinicians and patients all over the world. ""Everyone involved is excited about the recovery cuff. It has the potential to revolutionise how people recover from sporting exertions and manage injuries at home.""   In Production  Production is underway for the first 200 cuffs.

<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">DRACOs (Double-stranded RNA Activated Caspase Oligomerizers) are broad-spectrum antiviral candidates developed by Dr. Todd Rider. They have proved safe and effective in treating ALL 18 viruses against which Dr. Rider has tested them in proof-of-concept work. Two different types of H1N1 influenza (flu), four types of rhinovirus (the common cold), two adenoviruses, dengue hemorrhagic fever, and others were among the 18 viruses that DRACOs have successfully treated in human and animal cells and in mice.</span><br/>

<h4>We are now raising funds to test and optimize DRACOs against the herpesvirus family, which contains many major clinical viruses such as Herpes Simplex Virus 1 (HSV-1), Herpes Simplex Virus 2 (HSV-2), Cytomegalovirus (CMV), Varicella Zoster Virus (VZV, chickenpox and shingles virus), Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV), and Kaposi's Sarcoma Herpesvirus (KSHV). Depending on funds, we also hope to test and optimize DRACOs against the family of retroviruses, which includes Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) and Human T-Lymphotropic Virus (HTLV). In principle, the DRACO approach should be effective against virtually all known viruses, or potentially even against new viruses that may appear.</h4>

<div>Currently, DRACOs are in the Valley of Death--the financial and experimental gap between the previously funded National Institutes of Health (NIH) proof of concept experiments and the threshold for convincing major pharmaceutical companies to advance DRACOs toward human trials. This campaign has been set up to raise the funding necessary to bridge that gap. With your assistance, we hope to raise enough funding to test and optimize DRACOs against clinically relevant viruses in human cells. If successful, the results of those experiments should persuade pharmaceutical companies and other major sponsors to commit their own resources to advance DRACOs through large-scale animal trials and hopefully human trials. Without your assistance, DRACOs may never progress further, and their potential to revolutionize the treatment of viral infections may remain unfulfilled.<br/>

DRACOs (Double-stranded RNA Activated Caspase Oligomerizers) are broad-spectrum antiviral candidates developed by Dr. Todd Rider. They have proved safe and effective in treating ALL 18 viruses against which Dr. Rider has tested them in proof-of-concept work. Two different types of H1N1 influenza (flu), four types of rhinovirus (the common cold), two adenoviruses, dengue hemorrhagic fever, and others were among the 18 viruses that DRACOs have successfully treated in human and animal cells and in mice.



Check out the published results in the peer-reviewed journal PLOS ONE.



We are now raising funds to test and optimize DRACOs against the herpesvirus family, which contains many major clinical viruses such as Herpes Simplex Virus 1 (HSV-1), Herpes Simplex Virus 2 (HSV-2), Cytomegalovirus (CMV), Varicella Zoster Virus (VZV, chickenpox and shingles virus), Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV), and Kaposi's Sarcoma Herpesvirus (KSHV). Depending on funds, we also hope to test and optimize DRACOs against the family of retroviruses, which includes Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) and Human T-Lymphotropic Virus (HTLV). In principle, the DRACO approach should be effective against virtually all known viruses, or potentially even against new viruses that may appear.

Dr. Rider’s DRACO approach and results have been called “visionary” by the White House (National Bioeconomy Blueprint, April 2012, p. 9), named one of the best inventions of the year by Time magazine (November 28, 2011, pp. 58, 78), and featured on the BBC Horizons TV program (2013).


Dr. Todd Rider invented DRACOs (Double-stranded RNA Activated Caspase Oligomerizers) at MIT. DRACOs are novel broad-spectrum antiviral drugs that have the potential to revolutionize the treatment and prevention of virtually ALL viral diseases. So far, DRACOs have successfully treated 18 viruses in laboratory tests. DRACOs have proved effective against rhinovirus (the common cold), H1N1 influenza (flu), dengue hemorrhagic fever virus, and more.
With more research, DRACOs may be able to Treat ALL VIRUSES and:




 

A DRACO has already proved effective against rhinoviruses (common cold) and H1N1 Influenza (Swine Flu) in mice and human cell tests!


(i.e; Ebola, Avian Influenza (bird flu), SARS, MERS, etc.)



End the suffering and save the lives of those with incurable viruses (i.e; HIV/ Aids, HSV (cold sores and genital herpes), herpes zoster virus (chickenpox/shingles), HTLV, HPV, etc...)





However, research on DRACOs has entered the well-known “Valley of Death”(Source: NY Times), in which a lack of funding prevents DRACOs, and many other promising new drugs, from advancing toward human clinical trials. 
DRACOs may end suffering and save the lives of those struggling with any number of viruses. The development of antibiotics revolutionized the treatment and prevention of bacterial infections in the mid-20th century. 
With your help, we can bypass the Valley of Death and revolutionize the Treatment of Viral Disease. 












By the process of efficiently eliminating only virus-infected cells, DRACOs may be able to permanently cure viral infections that can currently only be controlled.










When tested in human and animal cells, DRACOs have been nontoxic and effective against 18 different viruses, including rhinovirus (the common cold) and dengue hemorrhagic fever (see table below that outlines 15/18 of the viruses. The additional 3 viruses were coronaviruses).


For more information on the results of previous DRACO experiments, see the article published in PLOS ONE.
Still looking for more explanation? Check out this great video!










The ultimate goal is to develop DRACOs as a cure for virtually all viruses. But in order for that to happen, we'll need the following:
Lab Space


UMass Lowell is an option that is available for us.
Equipment




Continued Research and Progression of Trials





All money goes to 501(c)(3) non-profit, SENS Research Foundation, and so all donations are Tax-Deductible.





Currently, DRACOs are in the Valley of Death--the financial and experimental gap between the previously funded National Institutes of Health (NIH) proof of concept experiments and the threshold for convincing major pharmaceutical companies to advance DRACOs toward human trials. This campaign has been set up to raise the funding necessary to bridge that gap. With your assistance, we hope to raise enough funding to test and optimize DRACOs against clinically relevant viruses in human cells. If successful, the results of those experiments should persuade pharmaceutical companies and other major sponsors to commit their own resources to advance DRACOs through large-scale animal trials and hopefully human trials. Without your assistance, DRACOs may never progress further, and their potential to revolutionize the treatment of viral infections may remain unfulfilled.

85% of your donation, less the $0.30 credit card fee on each transaction and overhead costs, will go directly to DRACOs research!

<h3>About Me &amp; Bone Kush</h3>
<p>Hi, my name is Jody Held! I'm a Massage Therapist of 27 years. I live in Florida and visit the pool a lot with my friends! Honestly, I originally invented this product for myself because I didn't want to lean on my hands or arms when tanning. I'm very protective of them and taking care of them is really important to me because of my profession.</p>
<p>I searched for a product like this on the web because a rolled towel or pillow were not cutting it and would slip around too much. When I couldn't find a solution to this problem, I designed a prototype and made one of my own! Since then I have shared this product everywhere I go and everyone just loves it. In fact, the more people that I share it with, the more uses we discover for it too.<br/><br/>This campaign is important to me because I will be able to get the first run of Bone Kush manufactured and distributed to all those people who actually NEED it, at the poolside and everywhere else too.<br/> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>My target for this crowdfunding campaign is $15000. Here’s what we need those funds for and where they will be going…</p>
<p>Firstly, there is an upfront cost of $2800 for tooling &amp; CAD. This creates the manufacturing mould for the product to be mass produced. $9200 will go towards the actual cost of manufacturing and packaging the product in bulk. Then there is a $1000 shipping cost to have the completed and packaged products delivered to a central location where they will be distributed out from.</p>
<p>Lastly, I am not the most tech savvy person. $2000 will fund the ongoing cost of a web master’s support with the technical elements and marketing for this campaign and for Bone Kush. This will enable me to reach more people and in turn the target set for this campaign.</p>
<p>Whether the final target is met or not the funds from this campaign will still go towards the manufacturing, packaging and distribution of Bone Kush.<br/> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Your contribution will mean the world to me because it will help me to finally get this project into the market place. Inventing is my passion and I have other inventions waiting to bust out! Bone Kush is just the first of many that I want to bring to the market and the public. Your contribution to this campaign will also be supporting a female inventor with a patent. This is a really big deal because females hold less than 7% of patents in the USA!<br/> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The biggest obstacle Bone Kush has faced up to this point has been getting the physical product mass manufactured so that I could begin to sell it. My determination to get my product to market and find a solution means that I have successfully found a manufacturer to help me to bring Bone Kush to life! Once this first run of manufacturing is completed and with your support in this campaign, I can begin to show and sell Bone Kush to businesses and at trade shows.</p>
<p>Whatever challenges or obstacles arise, I know am a strong independent woman with an inventor's will to survive and thrive. I continue to grow, learn and immerse myself into the inventor's world, which is a whole new planet for me. It's super fun and frustrating with all the ups and downs of a roller coaster! Yet I keep getting in line for the ride, over and over again. It is not in my nature to give up.</p>
<p>""Find the path or make the path"" - that's my motto.<br/> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you aren't able to contribute to this campaign financially or this product is not for you, you can still support me and Bone Kush. Please use the share tools on this page to help spread the word about Bone Kush to others who might benefit from this product. You could purchase a Bone Kush as a gift for a family member or friend who does have a use for one. Thank you for your support, it means the world to me!</p>

I know what it takes to make not only the 1st step, but the 2nd, on through the next few weeks that prove to be the breaking point as not much results are seen during this time and eventually to the promiseland. My social media &amp; before - after pics speak for themselves. </p>
<p>I love helping people. I know I can help everyone who reaches out to me. I was once just a normal person, normal body, just doing ok. I wanted more and I took the steps needed and now here I am. This is my life, this is what I do. Anyone who knows me can tell you I live in the Gym LOL.</p>
<p>Contributions are the key to this people helping system. I already do as much as I can IN-PERSON and ONLINE as a Personal Trainer. A facility geared towards a rehabish outlook on the addiction to bad habits, food choices and excuses would allow the residents the environment, staff and tools it takes to learn how to do it themselves so once released back into their world they: </p>
<p>1. Look Good </p>
<p>2. Feel Good </p>
<p>3. Have the knowledge to keep it going </p>
<p>4. Can spread the word to their loved ones. </p>
<p>5. May always return for refresher courses via online, app or in person.</p>

<p>People are better than banks!!! Lets do this together!!! Getting a loan is not easy</p>
<p>We would want to purchase an acre of land, build a full gym with inside and outside features to the excercise &amp; workout worlds available and a residential facility capable of 1 week to 6 month stays. Enough down payment money to get it started is enough, if we exceed our goal and have the ability to buy cash, that is even better. We would also be building the facility to be Solar powered and "" Off The Grid "" !!! Yeah! You know what that means? We care about getting our planet in shape too!!!</p>
<p>1. Acre of land ( two acres would be even better, ie track, olympic swimming pool, crossfit outdoors, obstacle course, hike &amp; bike trail, Commercial land can cost over a million an acre in South Florida. </p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">2. Building a facility from ground up - $? </span></p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">3. Gym equipment - $ buy or lease? </span></p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Everything depends upon the contributions here whether we can buy or lease and the difference between them both is huge. This is my dream and it will come true, the fundraising part is a learning experience for me right now, if you have any suggestions feel free to let us know.  </span></p>
<p>I live the gym life, I live for helping people get in shape and feeling better about themselves by reaching their fitness goals. I know this is a for sure winner, imagine husbands or wives leaving for "" The Army "" and coming back from bootcamp, only its the Fitness Army !!! You feel me? They come back and can spread the lifestyle, become coaches and mentors alike. </p>
<p>If we do not reach our goal, we are still here everyday doing this, it is our passion it is our lifestyle and we want to make it available to everyone who reaches out for it. We would want to still open a gym by leasing a building, leasing equipment if it is withing reach with what we raise. We will keep trying until we accomplish this !!!<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">The monies would be put to good use via online sponsorships to needy individuals and help The Linda Durbesson Brand become a heavy hitter in the fitness world to be able to continue providing excellent correspondence in person or online. We are creating a clothing line as well and any ideas that make sense will be put to the test. If we do not open the gym and you contribute a large amount and would want a refund just contact us and we will work that out with you no problem.</span></p>
</div> <div> <h3>LD Fit : The Rehab Gym</h3>
<div>Your contributions will provide the facility for people wanting to learn how to live their life as a dedicated fitness person, from the time they wake up, to the time they go to sleep and everything that goes along with it. Its one thing to read a book, or watch a video, talk to someone, but to live alongside them, for a week, a month, 6 months.... on the job training is the best knowledge. I would bet this system would franchise out in the near future. </div>
<div>Look at my story, from being an average young French lady, to a fitness guru. It was a long journey and continues to be, but ask anyone who has accomplished the same feats, it is well worth it. Not knowing where and how to start is what can stop you from ever setting forth on that journey. </div>

</div></div>","LD FIT : The Gym I am Linda Durbesson, Personal Trainer, Fitness Model & soon to be Competitor.
I have a bachelors degree in Physical Fitness and more to the point, I live the lifestyle required to transform your body from an average « Joan or Joe to a Goddess or God"". I know what it takes to make not only the 1st step, but the 2nd, on through the next few weeks that prove to be the breaking point as not much results are seen during this time and eventually to the promiseland. My social media & before - after pics speak for themselves. 
I love helping people. I know I can help everyone who reaches out to me. I was once just a normal person, normal body, just doing ok. I wanted more and I took the steps needed and now here I am. This is my life, this is what I do. Anyone who knows me can tell you I live in the Gym LOL.
Contributions are the key to this people helping system. I already do as much as I can IN-PERSON and ONLINE as a Personal Trainer. A facility geared towards a rehabish outlook on the addiction to bad habits, food choices and excuses would allow the residents the environment, staff and tools it takes to learn how to do it themselves so once released back into their world they: 
1. Look Good 
2. Feel Good 
3. Have the knowledge to keep it going 
4. Can spread the word to their loved ones. 
5. May always return for refresher courses via online, app or in person.
   $300k is what we need to get this started LD FIT : The Gym - Building A Dream From The Ground Up
People are better than banks!!! Lets do this together!!! Getting a loan is not easy
We would want to purchase an acre of land, build a full gym with inside and outside features to the excercise & workout worlds available and a residential facility capable of 1 week to 6 month stays. Enough down payment money to get it started is enough, if we exceed our goal and have the ability to buy cash, that is even better. We would also be building the facility to be Solar powered and "" Off The Grid "" !!! Yeah! You know what that means? We care about getting our planet in shape too!!!
1. Acre of land ( two acres would be even better, ie track, olympic swimming pool, crossfit outdoors, obstacle course, hike & bike trail, Commercial land can cost over a million an acre in South Florida. 
2. Building a facility from ground up - $? 
3. Gym equipment - $ buy or lease? 
Everything depends upon the contributions here whether we can buy or lease and the difference between them both is huge. This is my dream and it will come true, the fundraising part is a learning experience for me right now, if you have any suggestions feel free to let us know.  
I live the gym life, I live for helping people get in shape and feeling better about themselves by reaching their fitness goals. I know this is a for sure winner, imagine husbands or wives leaving for "" The Army "" and coming back from bootcamp, only its the Fitness Army !!! You feel me? They come back and can spread the lifestyle, become coaches and mentors alike. 
If we do not reach our goal, we are still here everyday doing this, it is our passion it is our lifestyle and we want to make it available to everyone who reaches out for it. We would want to still open a gym by leasing a building, leasing equipment if it is withing reach with what we raise. We will keep trying until we accomplish this !!!The monies would be put to good use via online sponsorships to needy individuals and help The Linda Durbesson Brand become a heavy hitter in the fitness world to be able to continue providing excellent correspondence in person or online. We are creating a clothing line as well and any ideas that make sense will be put to the test. If we do not open the gym and you contribute a large amount and would want a refund just contact us and we will work that out with you no problem.
  LD Fit : The Rehab Gym
Your contributions will provide the facility for people wanting to learn how to live their life as a dedicated fitness person, from the time they wake up, to the time they go to sleep and everything that goes along with it. Its one thing to read a book, or watch a video, talk to someone, but to live alongside them, for a week, a month, 6 months.... on the job training is the best knowledge. I would bet this system would franchise out in the near future. 
Look at my story, from being an average young French lady, to a fitness guru. It was a long journey and continues to be, but ask anyone who has accomplished the same feats, it is well worth it. Not knowing where and how to start is what can stop you from ever setting forth on that journey. 
If you are a contributor, make it known to us and we will provide you with an accommodating package to use for whomever you see fit. Don’t just donate money, follow me on my social medias and watch the progress we make. Let's do this!

All In with LD FITSet Your Mind & Goals!  It’s The Best Decision You Will Ever Make! Start Today & Help The Movement
  Together we cannot fail. A team of knowledgeable Trainers, who live the lifestyle, not just have the job title, will not accept defeat. They will make everyone coming through our doors a winner. We hold ourselves to high standards of dedication to our clients, residents and followers. We treat our business like we do our bodies, and that is something you can see without a doubt. You cannot photoshop a real person.

<h3><span style=""line-height: 26px;""><i>I think we can.</i></span></h3><p><span style=""font-weight: normal; line-height: 26px;"">     Let's help the Sadelain Lab at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center hire a cancer researcher focused on Wilms tumor.

It is thought that if we can successfully target this cell, we can improve the success of front-line treatments, and reduce the rates of relapsed disease.</span></p>
<div><b>My Story:</b></div>
<div>     I am the parent of a stage IV, diffuse anaplastic, Wilms tumor survivor, Miss Stellablue Woods, age 7. Stellablue was diagnosed at the age of 4, and has been through more medical procedures than most people will experience in a lifetime. Stellablue has a rare version of Wilms Tumor, and her prognosis is not so great. In early 2013, Stellablue went through a stem cell transplant in an attempt to finally cure her of the disease. It became a goal of mine to find and promote new and more promising research and treatment options for Stellablue and the other 500+ kids diagnosed with Wilms tumor every year. The present-day treatments for anaplastic Wilms were falling woefully short of actually saving kids like Stellablue. I saw that new research, new medicines, and new therapeutic strategies were needed in order to provide more promising treatment options for Stella and other kiddos like her.</div>
<div>     In the process of researching Wilms tumor, I discovered a 2013 paper which showed that the cancer stem cell for Wilms tumor was marked by CD56, and that this cell was likely responsible for disease progression and relapse after treatment. In the year or so that followed, I lobbied the Children's Oncology Group, the National Cancer Institute, and a drug company, in support of a phase I clinical trial for a CD56-targeting monoclonal antibody drug conjugate against Wilms tumor and several other childhood CD56-expressing cancers.</div>
<div>     In the process of advocating for this drug and clinical trial, I was introduced to Dr. Michel Sadelain's work with CD56-targeting CAR T-cells, a potent immunotherapeutic technique which also effectively targets CD56. I have shared with Dr. Sadelain my hopes for CD56 and Wilms tumor, and he has agreed that targeting CD56 may have promising implications for the disease. He also notes that while his lab is working on CD56-targeting CAR T-cells, they do not have a researcher focused on <i>Wilms tumor</i> within the lab. If we could find a way to fund a Wilms Fellow at the Sadelain Lab at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, it would certainly speed research directly related to the disease. Dr. Sadelain has proposed a budget of about $100,000 to hire a Wilms researcher. This person (a doctoral fellow) would work in his lab and would apply this research directly to Wilms tumor.</div><div><b>How to Help:</b></div>
<div>     Currently, there are at least  1,000 of us Wilms tumor families out there, and if we (plus our network of friends) could each donate $100 or $25 or even $1 towards research that may one day save our own (or a loved one's) child we would be able to support this important research. Let's STEP UP where big-government and big-pharma have failed, and show them that it is indeed possible to fund rare childhood cancers!</div>
<div><b>Financial Transparency:</b></div><div>
<b>     </b>So where exactly will the money go? If we successfully raise $100,000, I will give the money to the Sadelain Lab at Memorial Sloan Kettering so they can hire a Wilms Fellow to study how their CD56-targeting CAR T-cells would work against Wilms tumor. This researcher would focus on looking at how the lab's research would be directly applicable to Wilms patients. Our hope is that this researcher would successfully use an immunotherapeutic technique to train the body's T-cells to target CD56, thereby eliminating the cancer stem cell for Wilms tumor. If we can target and eliminate this cell from Wilms tumor, we will likely see more successful front-line treatments, and reduced rates of relapsed disease.</div>
<div>     And what happens if we fail to meet our $100,000 goal? Even if we fall short, we can still directly support research relevant to Wilms Tumor. While we might not be able to fund a full-time Wilms researcher, even small donations can support research labs in various ways. This is a Wilms Tumor fundraiser, so  whether we reach our funding goal, fall short, or (hopefully) surpass it, 100% of the proceeds from this campaign will be donated to research related to Wilms tumor. I will provide a detailed account on this website, my facebook page, and by email, of how this money is ultimately spent to all donors, as well as provide updates to the Wilms tumor community on the status of this research.<br/>

Please share this campaign with your entire network.

<p>How does it work? You will get an easy @ home test kit, containing safety lancets and blood sample cards, to sample a drop of blood on a regular basis. You record your lifestyle habits.

<i>A biochemical fingerprint</i><br/><p><br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Technically speaking your biochemical fingerprint is a so-called <i>mass spectrum</i>. It reflects the proportion and quantity of over 1000 compounds in your blood and is therefore a snapshot of your metabolism. You cannot compare such a mass spectrum with a blood count. It does not fulfil the requirements of clinical diagnostics. Your metabolism does allow you to see changes of single compounds and compound groups, like vitamins or amino acids. </p>
<p><br/></p>
</div>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>In a small scientific study we found that lifestyle changes, typical habits and routines resulted in characteristic and reproducible changes in the metabolism and its biochemical fingerprint. With this project we want to understand these dynamics in a larger group. The more people join, the better. It will allow us to understand why people react differently and in a different pace to changes. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>In the first phase of the project, we will start with the recognition of metabolic patterns. We will also develop the Kenkodo app.  All participants will get access to their results. Finally, they will be the first to benefit from the final Kenkodo Kit that will be ready in December. </p>

<p>We will send you a Kenkodo @home Kit. On a regular basis you will sample a drop of blood by pricking your fingertip. This procedure is very reliable and completely harmless. The sample frequency and duration – weekly, daily, even a couple of times a day is possible – depends on the goals you want to achieve. Kenkodo will help you to define the optimal time points based on those goals.</p>
<p></p>

<br/><br/><h4><b>You monitor your lifestyle habits</b></h4>
<p>You will get an app for your smart phone. Here you can record you lifestyle habits, your mood and life events. Do you already have an activity tracker, a smart or sports watch? That’s great! You will have the opportunity to integrate the data and relevant data from other apps into the Kenkodo app.</p>

<h4><b>We show you the impact of your lifestyle habits</b></h4>
<p>One to two days after we have received your samples, your result will be available in your Kenkodo App. The App will show you on which days your fingerprints were very similar or very different. It will also show you the fingerprints matched to the recorded lifestyle habits. This combined information can help you identify those habits that lead you to the ideal fingerprint!</p>

<br/><br/><p>First, pick the perk you prefer; participate 1, 2 or 3 months. Then you start with your challenge of choice in the Beta Phase. Depending on the challenge you pick, you sample on a daily or a weekly basis, between 10 to 20 samples in total. We will provide you with a complete kit, including a time schedule. The Kit contains safety lancets, blood spot cards, a bullet proof manual and return envelopes. You will simultaneously receive a secret PIN which lets you anonymously register your kit online. We will send the packages mid April; our Kenkodo App will be available starting early May and then you can start sampling and tracking your lifestyle habits!</p>

<p>Are you a biohacker or interested in quantified self? We will offer you the possibility to download your raw data. With this data you can do your own analysis. The data will contain several hundred of metabolites. Please note that these data points are relative concentrations compared to your starting time point. With this information you can determine the rise and fall of some metabolites. Comparing this to other absolute data is not directly possible. </p>

<p>Over time, we will be able to deliver you a growing amount of information. After the completion of the Beta Phase we will carefully analyze all information. By doing so, we will find patterns and to date unknown correlations. It is our goal to find the pattern of that week in which you felt particularly well. Once you know the pattern, you can also track back/look back at the matching lifestyle habits and repeat it! At the same time, we will work on an App for you smartphone (for IOS and Android). It will enable you to integrate Kenkodo seamlessly into your daily routine. We will also make sure that the App can connect to other Tracking and Health Apps.</p>

<h3>The Tech Section</h3>
<p><br/></p>
<p>This section is dedicated to all you tech people, biohackers and quantified self experts, who really want to have a more in-depth-understanding of our metabolomics technology and the potential of quantifiying your metabolism.<br/></p>

<h4><b style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">This is what we do with your samples</b></h4>
<p></p>
<p>After we have received your samples, our lab-team directly cuts out the dried blood spots and starts the extraction. In this procedure, the blood spots are extracted chemically in such a way, that only the low molecular compounds are kept, while all other parts of the blood like DNA or proteins are dismissed. This ensures, that we only measure the parts we are particularly interested in, without anything else interfering and spoiling the results. </p>

<p><span>The measurement itself is carried out by mass-spectrometry. Metabolites can be distinguished by their mass. A mass-spectrometer is like a scale which weighs the different metabolites and counts their presence in the sample. What we call a metabolic fingerprint is in fact a continuous curve, which comprises the distribution  of specific masses in a particular sample:</span></p>

<i>A biochemical fingerprint</i><p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h4><br/></h4>Each of the lines you can see in this fingerprint correspond to a particular compound, and the higher the lines (peaks) are, the more abundant the compound is. A fingerprint as it is recorded by our machine (qTOF) contains far more than 1000 of those peaks.<p></p>

<p></p>
<p>After we measured your samples you will have access to the these raw data. You will also get a navigator to explore these data. Are you interested in your Vitamin D levels? Our tool will help you to navigate through the data.</p>
<p>What if you are not interested in all these raw data, but just want easy to read results? That’s fine too: the tool can also show you just those values you are interested in.</p>

<h4><b style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">The Kenkodo Evolution</b></h4>
<p></p>
<p>Kenkodo gives you the opportunity to have a very detailed look into the compounds you are interested in. We will assist you identifying them. What to look for depends on the wellness goals you have set up. As Kenkodo grows and develops, we will be more and more able to recognize fingerprints as a holistic statement of your well-being.</p>
<p><b style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""><br/></b></p>
<h4><b style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Sampling once per week is enough - for the long-term effects</b></h4>
<p>We believe that taking one drop of blood per week is enough. Of course your metabolome changes right after a double shot espresso. However, these are the short-term effects which can be considered as noise. The same kind of noise, when you listen to your favorite song on the radio instead of your perfectly sounding iPod ;) Kenkodo uncovers the long-term effects of your lifestyle from this noise.To achieve that, its important to sample under the same conditions (e.g. monday morning after getting up). Our data analysis approach will then be able to distinguish noise and unmask the long-term symphony of your bloods fingerprint.</p>

<h4><b style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Influence Tomorrow’s Health Today, with Kenkodo!</b></h4>If you want to understand the long term effect of your lifestyle on your body, then it is enough to sample once per week at a preset time. But, if for some particular reasons you would like to understand the direct effects of a daily lifestyle change, then you should sample more often. We however believe that Kenkodo will become an effective tool if you keep track of your metabolism for a longer time. <br/><p></p>

<h4>
</h4>
<h4><br/></h4>
<h4>Is Kenkodo also available in my country? </h4>
<p>Yes, from Germany we ship to all countries. If you order from outside Germany, just add the €7 Perk for one-way international shipping. Of course, if, for some reason, we cannot ship to your country, we will give you a full refund.</p>
<h4><br/></h4>
<h4>What is metabolomics?</h4>
<p>The metabolic profile is the sum of all small molecules, known as metabolites, that circulate in your body. It includes sugars, amino acids, vitamins and much more. In one single drop of blood we can see all metabolites. A drop of blood provides a snapshot of your physiological state.  Looking at metabolites gives answers to questions like: how does my body process the food I just ate? How stressed or exhausted am I? Do I accumulate environmental pollutants? Am I at risk to get a disease?</p>
<p>The metabolic profile is your personal fingerprint telling you where you come from and where you heading to on the biochemical level.</p>
<p>Metabolomics is the technology which measures metabolic profiles. The origins of measuring metabolites in complex samples has existed for decades. Today, we are able to measure all of these compounds quickly and accurately.</p>
<h3><br/></h3>
<h4>What influences my metabolomics?</h4>
<h3></h3>
<p>A large range of different parameters can influence metabolic profiles, both genetic as well as environmental parameters. These parameters include gender, ancestry, age, allergies, diseases, family history of disease, blood marker and blood group, medication, diet and supplements (pro-/prebiotics), mood, fertility, pregnancy, stress, sport, meditation, sleep, environmental effects (like weather).</p>
<br/><h4><b>What will the results look like?</b></h4>
<p>The app will visualize the similarities and differences of your biochemical fingerprints. Are you interested in understanding lifestyle habits that correlate with your fingerprints? Kenkodo will show you the connections! Kenkodo will become more reliable if you use it regularly. Kenkodo will provide predictions related to your body and mind performance.</p>
<p>Technically seen is your biochemical fingerprint a so-called mass spectrum. It reflects the proportion and quantity of over 1000 compounds in your blood and is therefore a snapshot of your metabolism. You cannot compare such a mass spectrum with a blood count. It does not fulfill the requirements of clinical diagnostics. However, it allows you to see changes of single compounds and compound groups, like vitamins or amino acids. Besides that, you can relate them with your lifestyle habits. The Kenkodo app will navigate you smoothly through all the information. It will give you suggestions why some compounds are of particular importance, and will warn you for misinterpretations. If you want you can also download your raw data. Because you are the CEO of your data.</p>
<br/><h4>Is Kenkodo different from a complete blood count (CBC)?</h4>
<p>A complete blood count, like requested by your general practitioner, is a small yet highly accurate report for a few, distinct markers in your blood.</p>
<p>These include metabolites like glucose but also non-metabolic components and factors like ions, proteins or cell types, indicating very specific health conditions. Since our technology tracks more than 1000 metabolites you can rather think of it as of a highly personalized fingerprint. It specifically answers many questions regarding your wellness and your general constitution.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h4>Is Kenkodo a medical device?</h4>
<p>No. Kenkodo is neither a medical product, nor does it fulfill the requirements to be a diagnostic test or tool. In its current form, Kenkodo helps you to keep track of your well-being.</p>
<p>However, we do understand the potential of our product. Kenkodo will evolve over time and will provide more features. Get in touch if you have specific ideas and wishes!</p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold; line-height: 24px; background-color: initial;""><br/></span></p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold; line-height: 24px; background-color: initial;"">Does Kenkodo replace my General Practitioner?</span></p>
<p>Kenkodo can not substitute any medical testing or diagnosis, such as a complete blood count. Please continue to consult your general practitioner as usually.</p>
<h4><br/></h4>
<h4>Can you guarantee that my personal data will be safe?</h4>
<p>The data privacy model that we have developed for Kenkodo builds fundamentally on the principle that nobody except you is in full control of your data. Always!</p>
<p>Our ultimate goal is to connect your individual lifestyle to your metabolism. To provide the best results for you, you need to keep a diary of your lifestyle habits. You may want to answer questions like: What did you eat? How much did you exercise? How did you feel? You should also add data from your wearables. However, you provide only the information you want to track.</p>
<p>We are taking all actions to ensure that using our service is as safe as online banking or accessing your business emails. This includes entirely encrypted communication, database encryption and European location of our servers. The Kenkodo app does not ask you for your name or address. Instead you just enter an anonymous code you receive together with your kit. Whenever we work with your samples, your metabolic profiles or your lifestyle data we can only see your code, but we never see who you are and since we do not know which code we sent to who, it is impossible to draw a connection to you.</p>
<h4><br/></h4>
<h4>Will you use my data for other purposes?</h4>
<p>We will never use your private data for any other purpose or sell your personal information to other parties. You will never take part in a third-party study, nor will your health insurance, your general practitioner, your employer or a social media contact have access to your data without your explicit consent. Your data is yours!</p>
<br/><h4>I love the idea, but what if I am afraid of pricking myself?</h4>
<p>We could tell you that, doing it properly, pricking your finger does not hurt at all. But if you really prefer not to, you could simply support us by spreading the word about Kenkodo, or by supporting us financially (see Contribution on the top right of this campaign page). You could also order a kit for someone else who would be happy to have one.</p>

<br/><p>Egal für welches Paket Du Dich entschieden hast, Du startest in unserer Entwicklungsphase mit einer Herausforderung, 'Challenge', Deiner Wahl. Je nach Challenge nimmst Du über einen Zeitraum von einigen Tagen bis zu mehreren Wochen teil. Wir erstellen Dir ein an die Challenge angepasstes Komplettpaket inklusive Zeitplan. Das Testset beinhaltet mehrere Sicherheitslanzetten, die Bluttropfenkarten, eine genaue Anleitung, sowie einen oder mehrere Briefumschläge. Gleichzeitig erhältst Du von uns eine geheime PIN, mit der Du Dein Testset registrieren kannst. Wir versenden die Pakete Mitte April. Anfang Mai ist die Beta-Version der Kenkodo App verfügbar. Dann kannst Du  mit der Probenahme und der Aufzeichnung Deiner Lebensgewohnheiten beginnen. Schon während der Entwicklungsphase erhältst Du alle Ergebnisse und Daten.</p>
<p>Nach Abschluss der Entwicklungsphase geben wir Kenkodo den letzten Feinschliff. Ab Januar werden wir die ersten fertigen Kenkodo Paketen auf den Markt bringen. Du -als Mitentwickler- erhältst Dein bestelltes Paket schon im Dezember. Die Kits sind mit 1, 2 oder 3 Monaten bezeichnet, was 4, 8 oder 12 Proben entspricht. Natürlich darfst Du selber festlegen, in welchen Intervallen Du Dich messen möchtest.</p>

</h4>
<h4>Was ist Metabolomics?</h4>
<p>Ein metabolisches Profil ist die Gesamtheit aller kleinen Moleküle, Metabolite, die in Deinem Blut zirkulieren. Dazu gehören verschiedene Zucker, Aminosäuren, Vitamine und viele mehr. In einem einzigen Bluttropfen können wir alle Metabolite analysieren. Dieser Tropfen ist ein Abbild Deines Lebensstils. Wenn wir uns diese Metabolite anschauen, können wir zum Beispiel folgende Fragen beantworten: Wie verarbeitet mein Körper mein Essen? Wie gestresst oder ausgepowert bin ich? Reichern sich Umweltgifte in meinem Körper an? Habe ich ein erhöhtes Krankheitsrisiko?</p>
<p>Das metabolische Profil ist Dein Fingerabdruck, der Dir sagt, woher Du metabolisch kommst und wohin sich Dein Stoffwechsel bewegt.</p>
<p>Die Technologie hinter dieser Analyse heißt: Metabolomics.</p>
<p>Die Technologie und Anwendung wird bereits seit einiger Zeit in der Wissenschaft benutzt. Heute sind wir in der Lage alle Metabolite schnell und robust zu messen und Dir diese Technologie zugänglich zu machen.</p>
<h4>Was beeinflußt meinen Stoffwechsel?</h4>
<p>Viele Faktoren beeinflussen Deinen Stoffwechsel. Dies sind zum einen Deine genetischen Faktoren und zum anderen alle Umwelteinflüsse. Faktoren und Einflüsse können zum Beispiel das Geschlecht, deine Vorfahren, dein Alter, Allergien, Krankheiten, Blutgruppe, Medikamente, Ernährung, Nahrungsergänzung, Stimmung, Schwangerschaft, Stress, Sport, Meditation, Schlaf und Umweltfaktoren wie das Wetter sein.</p>
<h4>Wie kann ich mir die Ergebnisse vorstellen?</h4>
<p>In der App werden die Ähnlichkeiten und Unterschiede der Stoffwechsel-Fingerabdrücke verschiedener Proben sehr klar und verständlich dargestellt. Dich interessieren Lebensgewohnheiten, die diese Ähnlichkeiten oder Unterschiede herbeigeführt haben? Kenkodo zeigt Dir Zusammenhänge auf! Je länger Du Kenkodo nutzt, umso zuverlässiger wirst Du Vorhersagen treffen können, die Deine körperliche und geistige Leistungsfähigkeit betreffen.</p>
<p>Technisch gesehen ist Dein biochemischer Fingerabdruck ein sogenanntes Massenspektrum. Es gibt die Mengenverhältnisse von über 1000 Substanzen in Deinem Blut wieder und ist somit eine Momentaufnahme Deines Stoffwechsels. Ein solches Massenspektrum darfst Du nicht mit einem Blutbild verwechseln. Es erfüllt nicht die Anforderungen an eine klinische Diagnostik. Aber es lässt zu, dass Du Dir die relativen Änderungen einzelner Substanzen und Substanzgruppen, z.B. von  Vitaminen oder Aminosäuren anzeigen lassen kannst. Außerdem kannst Du diese mit Deinen Lebensgewohnheiten abgleichen. Damit Du Dich in diesen Daten nicht verlierst, wird Dich die Kenkodo App sicher hindurch navigieren. Sie wird Dir Hinweise geben warum manche Substanzen besonders wichtig sind und Dich vor Fehlinterpretationen warnen.</p>
<p>Und wenn Du möchtest, kannst Du Dir auch die reinen Massenspektren als Rohdaten herunterladen. Schließlich gehören Deine Daten Dir.</p>
<h4>Wie unterscheidet sich Kenkodo von einem Blutbild?</h4>
<p>Ein Blutbild, wie es ein Hausarzt in Auftrag gibt, ist ein kleiner, aber sehr genauer Bericht über wenige, bekannte Blutmarker.</p>
<p>Das Blutbild beinhaltet Metabolite wie Glukose, aber auch andere nicht-metabolische Komponenten und Faktoren wie Eisen, Proteine oder Zelltypen. Diese Marker ermöglichen es Deinem Arzt, eine sehr genaue Diagnose zu erstellen.</p>
<p>Unsere Technologie analysiert über 1000 Metabolite. Ihre Zusammensetzung ergibt einen sehr persönlichen Fingerabdruck, der allerdings nicht ohne weiteres mit der Präzision eines ärztlichen Tests gemessen werden kann.</p>
<br/><h4>Ist Kenkodo ein Medizinprodukt?</h4>
<p>Nein. Kenkodo ist weder ein Medizinprodukt noch erfüllt es die Anforderungen an diagnostische Verfahren. In seiner heutigen Form hilft Dir Kenkodo, mehr Informationen über deinen Lebensstil zu erhalten.</p>
<p>Wir sehen jedoch das Potenzial von Kenkodo. Mit der Zeit werden wir zusammen mit unseren Kenkosiasten Kenkodo weiterentwickeln. Wenn Du Ideen dazu hast oder Wünsche, schick’ uns eine Nachricht!</p>
<br/><h4>Erspart Kenkodo mir den Gang zum Arzt?</h4>
<p>Kenkodo ist kein Ersatz für einen medizinischen Test oder eine Diagnose, wie zum Beispiel ein Blutbild.</p>
<p>Solltest Du gesundheitliche Probleme haben oder spezifische Fragen zu den Ergebnissen, konsultiere bitte weiterhin den Arzt Deines Vertrauens.</p>
<h4>Könnt Ihr die Sicherheit meiner Daten garantieren?</h4>
<p>Das Datenschutzmodell, das wir für Kenkodo entwickelt haben, basiert im Wesentlichen auf dem Prinzip, dass niemand außer Dir die Kontrolle über Deine Daten hat. Immer!</p>
<p>Unser oberstes Ziel ist es, Deinen individuellen Lebensstil und den Stoffwechsel miteinander zu verbinden. Um die besten Ergebnisse für Dich zu erzielen, solltest Du ein Tagebuch über Deine Lebensgewohnheiten führen. Du hast die Möglichkeit, Fragen zu beantworten, wie: Was habe ich gegessen? Wie viel Sport habe ich gemacht? Wie fühle ich mich? Du kannst auch Daten von Deinem Wearable hinzufügen. Es liegt jedoch an Dir, welche Daten Du uns zur Verfügung stellen willst.</p>
<p>Wir ergreifen alle Maßnahmen, um sicherzustellen, dass die Nutzung von Kenkodo so sicher wie möglich ist. So wie beim Online-Banking oder beim Zugriff auf Deine E-Mails. Dazu gehört eine verschlüsselte Kommunikation, Datenbank-verschlüsselung und ein europäischer Serverstandort. Die Kenkodo App wird Dich nicht nach Deinem Namen fragen. Stattdessen gibst Du einfach einen anonymen Code ein, den Du zusammen mit Deinem Kit erhältst. Immer, wenn wir mit Deinen Proben, mit Deinen metabolischen Profilen oder Deinen Lebensstilinformationen arbeiten, können wir Deinen Code sehen. Wir sehen nicht, wer dahinter steckt. Damit ist es unmöglich, auf Deine Identität zu schließen.</p>
<br/><br/><h4>Verwendet Ihr meine Daten auch für andere Untersuchungen?</h4>
<p>Wir werden Deine privaten Daten für keine anderen Untersuchungen nutzen oder diese Daten an andere verkaufen. Wir werden Deine Daten weder in einem anderen Zusammenhang verwenden, noch  würden wir Deine Daten mit Deinem Arzt, Deinem Arbeitgeber oder Deiner Krankenversicherung ohne Dein ausdrückliches Einverständnis teilen.</p>Deine Daten gehören Dir!<h4>Ich finde Kenkodo super, aber ich kann mir nicht in den Finger stechen.</h4>
<p>Wir könnten Dich überzeugen, dass in den Finger stechen gar nicht so weh tut und mit unserem Kit ganz einfach ist. Falls wir Dich nicht überzeugen können, dann unterstütze uns, indem Du möglichst vielen von Kenkodo erzählst. Oder Du spendest uns einen Betrag Deiner Wahl, um Kenkodo noch schneller weiterzuentwickeln und zu einem Erfolg zu machen. Oder Du bestellst ein Kit für eine Person, von der Du weißt, dass Sie sich darüber freuen würde. Die Möglichkeit findest Du rechts oben über den Perks.</p>
<h4><b>Ist Kenkodo in meinem Land verfügbar?</b></h4>
<p>Ja, wir versenden in alle Länder.<br/>Bitte wähle noch den 7€ Perk für internationale Versandkosten zu Deiner Bestellung. Falls wir aus welchen Gründen auch immer nicht in Dein Land versenden können, erstatten wir Dir den vollen Betrag.</p>

The campaign ended on the 31st of March. 
 The Kenkodo Beta Phase has started!  www.kenko.do





Learn more about your well-being and health status with the Kenkodo Metabolism Body Tracker. Support scientific progress, develop this tool with us, and be one of the first to use it!
Lifestyle habits have long term effects on our physical constitution, but changes in the metabolism can be measured immediately. Kenkodo recognizes those metabolic patterns that match with your goals: stress reduction, weight loss, staying healthy, or boosting your endurance. Kenkodo identifies those lifestyle habits that let you reach these goals in a reliable way.
The future of preventive healthcare starts  here!






How does it work? You will get an easy @ home test kit, containing safety lancets and blood sample cards, to sample a drop of blood on a regular basis. You record your lifestyle habits. We measure your blood and match your biochemical fingerprints with your lifestyle habits. The Kenkodo app will visualize your biochemical fingerprints related to lifestyle habits, like your hours of sleep. 

         This is what the future Kenkodo mobile app could look like.



The Kenkodo app will navigate you smoothly through all the information. It will give you suggestions why some compounds are of particular importance and will warn you for misinterpretations. If you want you can also download your raw data, because you are the CEO of your own data!



A biochemical fingerprint

Technically speaking your biochemical fingerprint is a so-called mass spectrum. It reflects the proportion and quantity of over 1000 compounds in your blood and is therefore a snapshot of your metabolism. You cannot compare such a mass spectrum with a blood count. It does not fulfil the requirements of clinical diagnostics. Your metabolism does allow you to see changes of single compounds and compound groups, like vitamins or amino acids. 




In a small scientific study we found that lifestyle changes, typical habits and routines resulted in characteristic and reproducible changes in the metabolism and its biochemical fingerprint. With this project we want to understand these dynamics in a larger group. The more people join, the better. It will allow us to understand why people react differently and in a different pace to changes. 

In the first phase of the project, we will start with the recognition of metabolic patterns. We will also develop the Kenkodo app.  All participants will get access to their results. Finally, they will be the first to benefit from the final Kenkodo Kit that will be ready in December. 
















Would you like to try something new? Like eating vegetarian for a week? Double your running distance, or simply just lie-in longer? In the first phase of the project we will offer you challenges like these. And we are happy to hear your ideas. Based on the challenge you set, you will get a Beta-Kit with 10-20 samples. We will analyze the effects on your metabolism.
After the completion of the Beta Phase, you will get the monthly package of choice (see Perks) of the final Kenkodo Kit.







We believe that Kenkodo will change the way we listen to our body. On the long term, it will revolutionize our knowledge about health.

Do you want to recognize the lifestyle habits that are good for you? Support scientific progress and develop Kenkodo with us - your way to a healthier life.

Please keep on reading if you want to know more about the project, technical stuff and quantified self! We have also included a Frequently Asked Questions section. For anything else you can leave a comment or email us!



You take a sample
We will send you a Kenkodo @home Kit. On a regular basis you will sample a drop of blood by pricking your fingertip. This procedure is very reliable and completely harmless. The sample frequency and duration – weekly, daily, even a couple of times a day is possible – depends on the goals you want to achieve. Kenkodo will help you to define the optimal time points based on those goals.


You monitor your lifestyle habits
You will get an app for your smart phone. Here you can record you lifestyle habits, your mood and life events. Do you already have an activity tracker, a smart or sports watch? That’s great! You will have the opportunity to integrate the data and relevant data from other apps into the Kenkodo app.

We analyze your metabolism
You can mail us your samples hassle-free per post. In our lab we will measure the chemical composition of your blood samples.

We show you the impact of your lifestyle habits
One to two days after we have received your samples, your result will be available in your Kenkodo App. The App will show you on which days your fingerprints were very similar or very different. It will also show you the fingerprints matched to the recorded lifestyle habits. This combined information can help you identify those habits that lead you to the ideal fingerprint!






First, pick the perk you prefer; participate 1, 2 or 3 months. Then you start with your challenge of choice in the Beta Phase. Depending on the challenge you pick, you sample on a daily or a weekly basis, between 10 to 20 samples in total. We will provide you with a complete kit, including a time schedule. The Kit contains safety lancets, blood spot cards, a bullet proof manual and return envelopes. You will simultaneously receive a secret PIN which lets you anonymously register your kit online. We will send the packages mid April; our Kenkodo App will be available starting early May and then you can start sampling and tracking your lifestyle habits!



Are you a biohacker or interested in quantified self? We will offer you the possibility to download your raw data. With this data you can do your own analysis. The data will contain several hundred of metabolites. Please note that these data points are relative concentrations compared to your starting time point. With this information you can determine the rise and fall of some metabolites. Comparing this to other absolute data is not directly possible. 




Over time, we will be able to deliver you a growing amount of information. After the completion of the Beta Phase we will carefully analyze all information. By doing so, we will find patterns and to date unknown correlations. It is our goal to find the pattern of that week in which you felt particularly well. Once you know the pattern, you can also track back/look back at the matching lifestyle habits and repeat it! At the same time, we will work on an App for you smartphone (for IOS and Android). It will enable you to integrate Kenkodo seamlessly into your daily routine. We will also make sure that the App can connect to other Tracking and Health Apps.

The Tech Section

This section is dedicated to all you tech people, biohackers and quantified self experts, who really want to have a more in-depth-understanding of our metabolomics technology and the potential of quantifiying your metabolism.

This is what we do with your samples

After we have received your samples, our lab-team directly cuts out the dried blood spots and starts the extraction. In this procedure, the blood spots are extracted chemically in such a way, that only the low molecular compounds are kept, while all other parts of the blood like DNA or proteins are dismissed. This ensures, that we only measure the parts we are particularly interested in, without anything else interfering and spoiling the results. 



This is how we measure 



The measurement itself is carried out by mass-spectrometry. Metabolites can be distinguished by their mass. A mass-spectrometer is like a scale which weighs the different metabolites and counts their presence in the sample. What we call a metabolic fingerprint is in fact a continuous curve, which comprises the distribution  of specific masses in a particular sample:





A biochemical fingerprint


Each of the lines you can see in this fingerprint correspond to a particular compound, and the higher the lines (peaks) are, the more abundant the compound is. A fingerprint as it is recorded by our machine (qTOF) contains far more than 1000 of those peaks.

What you will get

After we measured your samples you will have access to the these raw data. You will also get a navigator to explore these data. Are you interested in your Vitamin D levels? Our tool will help you to navigate through the data.
What if you are not interested in all these raw data, but just want easy to read results? That’s fine too: the tool can also show you just those values you are interested in.

The Kenkodo Evolution

Kenkodo gives you the opportunity to have a very detailed look into the compounds you are interested in. We will assist you identifying them. What to look for depends on the wellness goals you have set up. As Kenkodo grows and develops, we will be more and more able to recognize fingerprints as a holistic statement of your well-being.

Sampling once per week is enough - for the long-term effects
We believe that taking one drop of blood per week is enough. Of course your metabolome changes right after a double shot espresso. However, these are the short-term effects which can be considered as noise. The same kind of noise, when you listen to your favorite song on the radio instead of your perfectly sounding iPod ;) Kenkodo uncovers the long-term effects of your lifestyle from this noise.To achieve that, its important to sample under the same conditions (e.g. monday morning after getting up). Our data analysis approach will then be able to distinguish noise and unmask the long-term symphony of your bloods fingerprint.

Influence Tomorrow’s Health Today, with Kenkodo!If you want to understand the long term effect of your lifestyle on your body, then it is enough to sample once per week at a preset time. But, if for some particular reasons you would like to understand the direct effects of a daily lifestyle change, then you should sample more often. We however believe that Kenkodo will become an effective tool if you keep track of your metabolism for a longer time.

Is Kenkodo also available in my country? 
Yes, from Germany we ship to all countries. If you order from outside Germany, just add the €7 Perk for one-way international shipping. Of course, if, for some reason, we cannot ship to your country, we will give you a full refund.

What is metabolomics?
The metabolic profile is the sum of all small molecules, known as metabolites, that circulate in your body. It includes sugars, amino acids, vitamins and much more. In one single drop of blood we can see all metabolites. A drop of blood provides a snapshot of your physiological state.  Looking at metabolites gives answers to questions like: how does my body process the food I just ate? How stressed or exhausted am I? Do I accumulate environmental pollutants? Am I at risk to get a disease?
The metabolic profile is your personal fingerprint telling you where you come from and where you heading to on the biochemical level.
Metabolomics is the technology which measures metabolic profiles. The origins of measuring metabolites in complex samples has existed for decades. Today, we are able to measure all of these compounds quickly and accurately.

What influences my metabolomics?

A large range of different parameters can influence metabolic profiles, both genetic as well as environmental parameters. These parameters include gender, ancestry, age, allergies, diseases, family history of disease, blood marker and blood group, medication, diet and supplements (pro-/prebiotics), mood, fertility, pregnancy, stress, sport, meditation, sleep, environmental effects (like weather).
What will the results look like?
The app will visualize the similarities and differences of your biochemical fingerprints. Are you interested in understanding lifestyle habits that correlate with your fingerprints? Kenkodo will show you the connections! Kenkodo will become more reliable if you use it regularly. Kenkodo will provide predictions related to your body and mind performance.
Technically seen is your biochemical fingerprint a so-called mass spectrum. It reflects the proportion and quantity of over 1000 compounds in your blood and is therefore a snapshot of your metabolism. You cannot compare such a mass spectrum with a blood count. It does not fulfill the requirements of clinical diagnostics. However, it allows you to see changes of single compounds and compound groups, like vitamins or amino acids. Besides that, you can relate them with your lifestyle habits. The Kenkodo app will navigate you smoothly through all the information. It will give you suggestions why some compounds are of particular importance, and will warn you for misinterpretations. If you want you can also download your raw data. Because you are the CEO of your data.
Is Kenkodo different from a complete blood count (CBC)?
A complete blood count, like requested by your general practitioner, is a small yet highly accurate report for a few, distinct markers in your blood.
These include metabolites like glucose but also non-metabolic components and factors like ions, proteins or cell types, indicating very specific health conditions. Since our technology tracks more than 1000 metabolites you can rather think of it as of a highly personalized fingerprint. It specifically answers many questions regarding your wellness and your general constitution.

Is Kenkodo a medical device?
No. Kenkodo is neither a medical product, nor does it fulfill the requirements to be a diagnostic test or tool. In its current form, Kenkodo helps you to keep track of your well-being.
However, we do understand the potential of our product. Kenkodo will evolve over time and will provide more features. Get in touch if you have specific ideas and wishes!

Does Kenkodo replace my General Practitioner?
Kenkodo can not substitute any medical testing or diagnosis, such as a complete blood count. Please continue to consult your general practitioner as usually.

Can you guarantee that my personal data will be safe?
The data privacy model that we have developed for Kenkodo builds fundamentally on the principle that nobody except you is in full control of your data. Always!
Our ultimate goal is to connect your individual lifestyle to your metabolism. To provide the best results for you, you need to keep a diary of your lifestyle habits. You may want to answer questions like: What did you eat? How much did you exercise? How did you feel? You should also add data from your wearables. However, you provide only the information you want to track.
We are taking all actions to ensure that using our service is as safe as online banking or accessing your business emails. This includes entirely encrypted communication, database encryption and European location of our servers. The Kenkodo app does not ask you for your name or address. Instead you just enter an anonymous code you receive together with your kit. Whenever we work with your samples, your metabolic profiles or your lifestyle data we can only see your code, but we never see who you are and since we do not know which code we sent to who, it is impossible to draw a connection to you.

Will you use my data for other purposes?
We will never use your private data for any other purpose or sell your personal information to other parties. You will never take part in a third-party study, nor will your health insurance, your general practitioner, your employer or a social media contact have access to your data without your explicit consent. Your data is yours!
I love the idea, but what if I am afraid of pricking myself?
We could tell you that, doing it properly, pricking your finger does not hurt at all. But if you really prefer not to, you could simply support us by spreading the word about Kenkodo, or by supporting us financially (see Contribution on the top right of this campaign page). You could also order a kit for someone else who would be happy to have one.

Gleichzeitig erhältst Du von uns eine geheime PIN, mit der Du Dein Testset registrieren kannst. Wir versenden die Pakete Mitte April. Anfang Mai ist die Beta-Version der Kenkodo App verfügbar. Dann kannst Du  mit der Probenahme und der Aufzeichnung Deiner Lebensgewohnheiten beginnen. Schon während der Entwicklungsphase erhältst Du alle Ergebnisse und Daten.
Nach Abschluss der Entwicklungsphase geben wir Kenkodo den letzten Feinschliff. Ab Januar werden wir die ersten fertigen Kenkodo Paketen auf den Markt bringen. Du -als Mitentwickler- erhältst Dein bestelltes Paket schon im Dezember. Die Kits sind mit 1, 2 oder 3 Monaten bezeichnet, was 4, 8 oder 12 Proben entspricht. Natürlich darfst Du selber festlegen, in welchen Intervallen Du Dich messen möchtest.

Bist Du ein Biohacker oder interessierst Du Dich für Quantified Self? Wir bieten Dir selbstverständlich den Download Deiner Rohdaten an. Damit kannst Du Deine eigene Auswertung machen. Der Datensatz wird mehrere hundert Stoffwechselprodukte enthalten. Bitte beachte, dass unsere Daten relative Konzentrationen zu Deinem Anfangszeitpunkt sind. Du kannst damit einen Anstieg oder Abfall von bestimmten Stoffwechselprodukten bestimmen. Der Vergleich mit absoluten Konzentrationen ist nicht direkt möglich. 


Über die Zeit können wir Dir immer mehr Informationen liefern. Nach dem Ende der Entwicklungsphase werden wir alle Informationen genau analysieren. Dabei werden wir Muster und bis jetzt unbekannte Zusammenhänge finden. Unser Ziel ist es, für Dich das Muster einer großartigen Woche zu erkennen und Dir damit die Möglichkeit zu geben, diesen Zustand durch eine bewusste Lebensweise zu wiederholen.
Gleichzeitig werden wir an einer App für Dein Smartphone (iOS und Android) arbeiten. Damit kannst Du Kenkodo nahtlos in Deinen Tagesablauf integrieren. Ebenso werden wir auch an einer Verbindung der App mit anderen Tracking- oder Gesundheitsapps arbeiten.

Was ist Metabolomics?
Ein metabolisches Profil ist die Gesamtheit aller kleinen Moleküle, Metabolite, die in Deinem Blut zirkulieren. Dazu gehören verschiedene Zucker, Aminosäuren, Vitamine und viele mehr. In einem einzigen Bluttropfen können wir alle Metabolite analysieren. Dieser Tropfen ist ein Abbild Deines Lebensstils. Wenn wir uns diese Metabolite anschauen, können wir zum Beispiel folgende Fragen beantworten: Wie verarbeitet mein Körper mein Essen? Wie gestresst oder ausgepowert bin ich? Reichern sich Umweltgifte in meinem Körper an? Habe ich ein erhöhtes Krankheitsrisiko?
Das metabolische Profil ist Dein Fingerabdruck, der Dir sagt, woher Du metabolisch kommst und wohin sich Dein Stoffwechsel bewegt.
Die Technologie hinter dieser Analyse heißt: Metabolomics.
Die Technologie und Anwendung wird bereits seit einiger Zeit in der Wissenschaft benutzt. Heute sind wir in der Lage alle Metabolite schnell und robust zu messen und Dir diese Technologie zugänglich zu machen.
Was beeinflußt meinen Stoffwechsel?
Viele Faktoren beeinflussen Deinen Stoffwechsel. Dies sind zum einen Deine genetischen Faktoren und zum anderen alle Umwelteinflüsse. Faktoren und Einflüsse können zum Beispiel das Geschlecht, deine Vorfahren, dein Alter, Allergien, Krankheiten, Blutgruppe, Medikamente, Ernährung, Nahrungsergänzung, Stimmung, Schwangerschaft, Stress, Sport, Meditation, Schlaf und Umweltfaktoren wie das Wetter sein.
Wie kann ich mir die Ergebnisse vorstellen?
In der App werden die Ähnlichkeiten und Unterschiede der Stoffwechsel-Fingerabdrücke verschiedener Proben sehr klar und verständlich dargestellt. Dich interessieren Lebensgewohnheiten, die diese Ähnlichkeiten oder Unterschiede herbeigeführt haben? Kenkodo zeigt Dir Zusammenhänge auf! Je länger Du Kenkodo nutzt, umso zuverlässiger wirst Du Vorhersagen treffen können, die Deine körperliche und geistige Leistungsfähigkeit betreffen.
Technisch gesehen ist Dein biochemischer Fingerabdruck ein sogenanntes Massenspektrum. Es gibt die Mengenverhältnisse von über 1000 Substanzen in Deinem Blut wieder und ist somit eine Momentaufnahme Deines Stoffwechsels. Ein solches Massenspektrum darfst Du nicht mit einem Blutbild verwechseln. Es erfüllt nicht die Anforderungen an eine klinische Diagnostik. Aber es lässt zu, dass Du Dir die relativen Änderungen einzelner Substanzen und Substanzgruppen, z.B. von  Vitaminen oder Aminosäuren anzeigen lassen kannst. Außerdem kannst Du diese mit Deinen Lebensgewohnheiten abgleichen. Damit Du Dich in diesen Daten nicht verlierst, wird Dich die Kenkodo App sicher hindurch navigieren. Sie wird Dir Hinweise geben warum manche Substanzen besonders wichtig sind und Dich vor Fehlinterpretationen warnen.
Und wenn Du möchtest, kannst Du Dir auch die reinen Massenspektren als Rohdaten herunterladen. Schließlich gehören Deine Daten Dir.
Wie unterscheidet sich Kenkodo von einem Blutbild?
Ein Blutbild, wie es ein Hausarzt in Auftrag gibt, ist ein kleiner, aber sehr genauer Bericht über wenige, bekannte Blutmarker.
Das Blutbild beinhaltet Metabolite wie Glukose, aber auch andere nicht-metabolische Komponenten und Faktoren wie Eisen, Proteine oder Zelltypen. Diese Marker ermöglichen es Deinem Arzt, eine sehr genaue Diagnose zu erstellen.
Unsere Technologie analysiert über 1000 Metabolite. Ihre Zusammensetzung ergibt einen sehr persönlichen Fingerabdruck, der allerdings nicht ohne weiteres mit der Präzision eines ärztlichen Tests gemessen werden kann.
Ist Kenkodo ein Medizinprodukt?
Nein. Kenkodo ist weder ein Medizinprodukt noch erfüllt es die Anforderungen an diagnostische Verfahren. In seiner heutigen Form hilft Dir Kenkodo, mehr Informationen über deinen Lebensstil zu erhalten.
Wir sehen jedoch das Potenzial von Kenkodo. Mit der Zeit werden wir zusammen mit unseren Kenkosiasten Kenkodo weiterentwickeln. Wenn Du Ideen dazu hast oder Wünsche, schick’ uns eine Nachricht!
Erspart Kenkodo mir den Gang zum Arzt?
Kenkodo ist kein Ersatz für einen medizinischen Test oder eine Diagnose, wie zum Beispiel ein Blutbild.
Solltest Du gesundheitliche Probleme haben oder spezifische Fragen zu den Ergebnissen, konsultiere bitte weiterhin den Arzt Deines Vertrauens.
Könnt Ihr die Sicherheit meiner Daten garantieren?
Das Datenschutzmodell, das wir für Kenkodo entwickelt haben, basiert im Wesentlichen auf dem Prinzip, dass niemand außer Dir die Kontrolle über Deine Daten hat. Immer!
Unser oberstes Ziel ist es, Deinen individuellen Lebensstil und den Stoffwechsel miteinander zu verbinden. Um die besten Ergebnisse für Dich zu erzielen, solltest Du ein Tagebuch über Deine Lebensgewohnheiten führen. Du hast die Möglichkeit, Fragen zu beantworten, wie: Was habe ich gegessen? Wie viel Sport habe ich gemacht? Wie fühle ich mich? Du kannst auch Daten von Deinem Wearable hinzufügen. Es liegt jedoch an Dir, welche Daten Du uns zur Verfügung stellen willst.
Wir ergreifen alle Maßnahmen, um sicherzustellen, dass die Nutzung von Kenkodo so sicher wie möglich ist. So wie beim Online-Banking oder beim Zugriff auf Deine E-Mails. Dazu gehört eine verschlüsselte Kommunikation, Datenbank-verschlüsselung und ein europäischer Serverstandort. Die Kenkodo App wird Dich nicht nach Deinem Namen fragen. Stattdessen gibst Du einfach einen anonymen Code ein, den Du zusammen mit Deinem Kit erhältst. Immer, wenn wir mit Deinen Proben, mit Deinen metabolischen Profilen oder Deinen Lebensstilinformationen arbeiten, können wir Deinen Code sehen. Wir sehen nicht, wer dahinter steckt. Damit ist es unmöglich, auf Deine Identität zu schließen.
Verwendet Ihr meine Daten auch für andere Untersuchungen?
Wir werden Deine privaten Daten für keine anderen Untersuchungen nutzen oder diese Daten an andere verkaufen. Wir werden Deine Daten weder in einem anderen Zusammenhang verwenden, noch  würden wir Deine Daten mit Deinem Arzt, Deinem Arbeitgeber oder Deiner Krankenversicherung ohne Dein ausdrückliches Einverständnis teilen.Deine Daten gehören Dir!Ich finde Kenkodo super, aber ich kann mir nicht in den Finger stechen.
Wir könnten Dich überzeugen, dass in den Finger stechen gar nicht so weh tut und mit unserem Kit ganz einfach ist. Falls wir Dich nicht überzeugen können, dann unterstütze uns, indem Du möglichst vielen von Kenkodo erzählst. Oder Du spendest uns einen Betrag Deiner Wahl, um Kenkodo noch schneller weiterzuentwickeln und zu einem Erfolg zu machen. Oder Du bestellst ein Kit für eine Person, von der Du weißt, dass Sie sich darüber freuen würde. Die Möglichkeit findest Du rechts oben über den Perks.
Ist Kenkodo in meinem Land verfügbar?
Ja, wir versenden in alle Länder.Bitte wähle noch den 7€ Perk für internationale Versandkosten zu Deiner Bestellung. Falls wir aus welchen Gründen auch immer nicht in Dein Land versenden können, erstatten wir Dir den vollen Betrag.

simple,
multi-gauge design made from flexible rubber with a barrel for the

holes.</p><p><b>The Evolution of the Base</b><br/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/272143/files/20131220183625-EvolvingAttachment-cropped.JPG?1387593385"" src="""" style=""width: 464px; height: 232px;""/></p>  <br/>This attachment device then evolved from rough
to finished, from holes to slots for the zip ties, from deep to shallow

holographic material to give the brightest iridescence on small, curved petals.
I soon added colorful swirls since most every child (and adult) likes rainbow colors.
More recently, petal width was reduced for lower wind resistance, less noise and
more stability at higher speeds, and fluorescent yellow was added for enhanced visibility. The
diamond-patterned “circle” at the tips changed to fluorescent yellow retroreflective, like
traffic signs, to reflect motorists’ headlights and harmonize with the overall newly
fluorescent design. </p>

<h3>UPDATE  7/25/12:</h3>
<p>Good news: the treatments are working! I'm not nearly so nauseous anymore, and my doctors and I have developed a REALLY solid treatment plan.</p>
<p>Bad news: they cost over $700, and I'll probably need them once every three weeks over a period of 6 months. That's over $4200 out of pocket. We've made $1640 so far -<strong> let's call $4200 an unofficial goal</strong> for the 5 remaining days. Please help spread the word - every cent helps so much!</p>
<h3>What's this all about?</h3>
<p>Angela, 24, has been volunteering with kids with disabilities literally since she was born; Angela has a passion for advocacy, improving the societal implications for anyone who is other than ""normal"". She went to college early and graduated from the University of Pittsburgh in 2009. Angela plans to get a graduate degree in sociology, establish a community theatre accessible to people with disabilites, and adopt a child with a disability.</p>
<p>The only obstacle to Angela's plans is her health. In the summer of 2007, at the age of 19, Angela began suffering from a difficult-to-treat digestive disorder. Dealing with this has derailed her life, putting her future on hold as she struggles to cope with the ever increasing costs of health care. </p>
<p><strong>If you were nauseous all the time, h</strong><strong>ow much could <em>you</em> accomplish?</strong></p>
<p>If you know Angela, then you know at least a bit about her experiences with her health, and health care, over the past five years.  If you don't know Angela, read on for a taste of her journey.</p>
<p>Angela started having digestive problems in the summer of 2007. A few months later she had symptoms every time she ate, and quickly lost a third of her body weight.  She was terrified of food and of how her body felt, and there didn't seem to be any end in sight. Angela had to quit her job and take a leave of absence from college. She planned her days around walking up her stairs once, but quite often she couldn't even get out of bed.</p>
<p>UPMC doctors performed extensive bloodwork and invasive tests, but couldn't diagnose Angela's problem. We finally found a doctor near Pittsburgh who knew what was wrong, but he couldn't fix her. We widened our search, finally finding a great doctor in Delaware. After Angela's health improved enough for her to graduate we moved across Pennsylvania to Philadelphia, uprooting our lives, changing career paths and putting off grad school, so that Angela's health could keep improving.</p>
<p>Having found effective treatments to manage her symptoms, life became more stable, and Angela felt great on our wedding day. Unfortunately, this was short-lived.  The doctor helping Angela was denied malpractice insurance...for NEVER being sued.  (Don't worry, it doesn't make sense to anyone else either.) Her next doctor helped Angela resume an active lifestyle for the first time in years. She works from home so she can worry less about unexpected symptom flares.</p>
<p>In the past few months, Angela's most recent doctors schedule prevented her receiving regular treatments, so her health suffered. The doctor then started his own practice that does not accept insurance. <strong>At this point, NO doctors near us that can help Angela accept insurance.</strong> On our healthcare plan, we must pay $5,000  per year on out-of-network treatment, after which we'll be partially reimbursed. Due to this, combined with a recent cut to Zac's pay, we cannot afford the treatment Angela needs to be healthy.</p>
<p>We're now treating Angela's healthcare as an investment. Angela just started seeing a doctor who, rather than continually masking her symptoms, may be able to cure her permanently. <strong>However, Angela needs regular treatment, and we flat-out cannot afford it.</strong> We're trying to work additional hours, pursuing additional jobs and cutting all possible expenses, but we're still several hundred dollars in the red.</p>
<p>We've been independent and self-sufficient for years, so it takes a lot for us to ask for help. This was not undertaken on a whim. We talked at length about our options, and decided that this was what made the most sense.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We can't adequately describe the impact that this would have on Angela's life.  To be truly healthy, for the first time in years...  That would be incredible.  As many of you know, you don't feel like yourself when you're sick - let alone when you're sick for 5+ years.  Thank you for even considering helping us, your support, your thoughts, and for reading this far!</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>All money raised will go directly to funding Angela's healthcare. $500 will fund for Angela's healthcare costs for one month - she needs testing, treatment, and supplements. If more is raised, Angela can be treated more regularly, and will achieve health even more quickly.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE 7/11/12: WE HIT OUR GOAL!!<br/></strong>Angela needs sustained treatment, so additional funds will go towards her medical expenses in the future. Thanks so much for your overwhelming support so far! We have until July 30 - let's see how much of her treatment we can fund!!</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My mom is a wonderful lady, 17 years ago when my father passed away he left no insurance and she's been working hard ever since, 6 years after my dad passed to take care of me,until I was an adult and now I want to help return the favor.</p>
<p>Last February her retina detached, and she had to have surgery, she had the surgery, and went to work less than a week later when doctors told her she needed to take 2 weeks off (she said she couldn't afford to take off). My sister and I did what we could to help, and she got through it. </p>
<p>In September It happened again, this time she took a month off, and I took 2 weeks off to travel to Michigan to Visit and Help where I could. I just recieved a phone call this morning that on Monday morning, she will have to have a third surgery because it detached again.</p>
<p>This means another month off from a job that already works her very little and changes her schedule daily, some days she gets called in the morning to tell her she isn't needed after all.</p>
<p>I know this third time will be a big struggle for her to pay her bills and for the medications and other things she will need paid after surgery, especially since she has already missed a month in September and was trying to play catch up still. I would do anything for my mom, unfortunately I can't afford to give her all the help she needs, anything would be much appreciated, and will go for bills and everyday needs as well as any costs she incurs above (ie: medications, extra bandages etc) that insurance doesn't cover.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need :</h3>
<p>I am trying to reach a minimum of 5,000. This would help her get caught up from the previous month she had to take off as well as help pay for anything she might need along the way in her recovery (ie: medications, extra bandages etc)</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>It would help this wonderful woman I am proud to call my mother through this difficult time. She could relax and recover knowing that she didn't have to worry about anything until she was able to go back to work again. In September she was so stressed about missing work that she couldn't focus on just relaxing and healing.I don't want her to go through that again.</p>

<div><span style=""font-family: Arial; font-size: small;"">Written by:  Jillian K. Welch<br/>In April  of 2010, my niece, Leisha, was diagnosed with Stage 3C breast cancer at 34 years  old.<br/>In the summer of 2010, I visited Leisha and her husband, Deo, at the  Pluta Cancer Center when she was in the early days of receiving  chemotherapy.  I had an appointment with an acupuncturist at the time on  the second floor.  I had asked Leisha ahead of time if it was okay to stop  by since I would be in the building.  I never want to intrude on anyone's  privacy unless I am given the go-ahead.<br/>I had not seen Leisha for a  while.  I was nervous about seeing her, but I checked in at the desk on the  first floor, and walked into a bright, window-filled room, with nicely painted  walls and pictures, and proceeded to look for her and Deo.  And then I saw  her sitting in a comfy chair hooked up to an IV, and she and Deo were quietly  playing cards on one of those handy hospital tables that can be raised up and  down, and moved around easily because of the wheels on the bottom.  Other  patients sat nearby as each underwent their own treatments.  People were  quietly talking with nurses and doctors.  Leisha wore a pink head  wrap.  Her flowing light brown hair had been donated to ""Locks of Love,""  before the chemo started.  Her sea-blue eyes looked more beautiful than  ever, and the familiar dimples in her cheeks formed as she smiled when she saw  me.  It was still Leisha.  It was Leisha battling cancer.  But it  was still Leisha, who smiles when the whole world is collapsing around her, who  smiles when she is being wronged or bullied.  It was still Leisha.  I  fought back the tears as I sat down to join them in a game of cards.  ""I  don't know how to play this game,"" I announced.  ""Don't worry, we'll teach  you,"" she said reassuringly.<br/>And here we are two years later.  It  has been a continuous battle with very little rest.  Several surgeries,  infections, ED visits,  hospitalizations, treatments, a daily regimen of  medications, and numerous follow-up appointments have been part of the job she  took on to be here for her twin boys.  Leisha's family, friends, and  community, and people she doesn't know have rallied around her.  And  recently there was a Nationwide Contest through ReMax Realty where she came in  second place to win $10,000.  Not only has she been dealing with the  medical issues from breast cancer, but the financial burden of trying to keep  their home, and the cost of daily living expenses.  But from losing this  Contest, two fundraising sites have been established on ""Indiegogo"". To the two  women who set up the sites, and who don't personally know Leisha, I want to tell  them thank you so much.  They have chosen a worthy cause.  The pain  and suffering Leisha has undergone, and the mental anguish of not knowing how  long she would be here for her family cannot be measured by a test or a  questionnaire.  But her gratitude can be seen in her actions and from her  heart.  The outpouring of support she has received from the community has been steady and loyal.  Since the Contest her community has grown to  include people from all over the world.<br/>And even though I have forgotten  the name of that new card game you taught me and how to play it, I have learned  something far more important from the past two years.  Goodness and  generosity can be found in the most difficult of times.<br/>With love and  support from your family.  Your Nanna would be so very proud of  you.<br/>Auntie Jillian</span></div>

WelchIn April  of 2010, my niece, Leisha, was diagnosed with Stage 3C breast cancer at 34 years  old.In the summer of 2010, I visited Leisha and her husband, Deo, at the  Pluta Cancer Center when she was in the early days of receiving  chemotherapy.  I had an appointment with an acupuncturist at the time on  the second floor.  I had asked Leisha ahead of time if it was okay to stop  by since I would be in the building.  I never want to intrude on anyone's  privacy unless I am given the go-ahead.I had not seen Leisha for a  while.  I was nervous about seeing her, but I checked in at the desk on the  first floor, and walked into a bright, window-filled room, with nicely painted  walls and pictures, and proceeded to look for her and Deo.  And then I saw  her sitting in a comfy chair hooked up to an IV, and she and Deo were quietly  playing cards on one of those handy hospital tables that can be raised up and  down, and moved around easily because of the wheels on the bottom.  Other  patients sat nearby as each underwent their own treatments.  People were  quietly talking with nurses and doctors.  Leisha wore a pink head  wrap.  Her flowing light brown hair had been donated to ""Locks of Love,""  before the chemo started.  Her sea-blue eyes looked more beautiful than  ever, and the familiar dimples in her cheeks formed as she smiled when she saw  me.  It was still Leisha.  It was Leisha battling cancer.  But it  was still Leisha, who smiles when the whole world is collapsing around her, who  smiles when she is being wronged or bullied.  It was still Leisha.  I  fought back the tears as I sat down to join them in a game of cards.  ""I  don't know how to play this game,"" I announced.  ""Don't worry, we'll teach  you,"" she said reassuringly.And here we are two years later.  It  has been a continuous battle with very little rest.  Several surgeries,  infections, ED visits,  hospitalizations, treatments, a daily regimen of  medications, and numerous follow-up appointments have been part of the job she  took on to be here for her twin boys.  Leisha's family, friends, and  community, and people she doesn't know have rallied around her.  And  recently there was a Nationwide Contest through ReMax Realty where she came in  second place to win $10,000.  Not only has she been dealing with the  medical issues from breast cancer, but the financial burden of trying to keep  their home, and the cost of daily living expenses.  But from losing this  Contest, two fundraising sites have been established on ""Indiegogo"". To the two  women who set up the sites, and who don't personally know Leisha, I want to tell  them thank you so much.  They have chosen a worthy cause.  The pain  and suffering Leisha has undergone, and the mental anguish of not knowing how  long she would be here for her family cannot be measured by a test or a  questionnaire.  But her gratitude can be seen in her actions and from her  heart.  The outpouring of support she has received from the community has been steady and loyal.  Since the Contest her community has grown to  include people from all over the world.And even though I have forgotten  the name of that new card game you taught me and how to play it, I have learned  something far more important from the past two years.  Goodness and  generosity can be found in the most difficult of times.With love and  support from your family.  Your Nanna would be so very proud of  you.Auntie Jillian",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>After was diagnosed at age 35, i dedicated my life to this project and now I need you. I had a fairly large invasive breast cancer, and it made me realize how little support is actually offered to people once they are diagnosed with cancer, and how lucky I was to be healthy again. A year later I started You Can Thrive!</p>
<p>I'm sure you realize that from reading the stories here everyone needs money for more medical costs.. how about some RELIEF from the side effects?</p>
<p>Almost all money raised for cancer goes to fund medical costs, medical testing or drug testing. Almost NONE of it goes to help PEOPLE with CANCER.</p>
<p>So I started working in 2005 to create real integrative resources for the women who come behind me to prevent and alleviate suffering. </p>
<p>I need your help. 10% of our clients are stage 4, and many others at earlier stages of this disease who need your assistance.  Your money will not help ONE person but MANY people with cancer. We have worked with hundreds of women in NYC to support them through treatment with access to free integrative services like Acupuncture, massage, reflexology, aromatherapy, nutritional counseling, patient advocacy and exercise/meditation. Please know that when you give every single dollar helps them directly to gain access to RELIEF. We are a volunteer grassroots effort and so I ask you to join me. Your money will not go to the medical system, it will support a person with cancer. Are you Pink for People? We are!!</p>
<div>I have recruited a community that gives their time and talents to help people with cancer through providing services that give relief from syptoms from cancer and it's related treatments. Through telling my story have opened a new HUGE center and we need support from YOU. Would you help me continue to make it happen for others?</div>
<p>This is true care, by and for the people. </p>
<p>Myself and many others here in NYC have dedicated their lives and hearts to helping those women going through breast cancer with direct services when they need it most and can afford it least. Things that help them get through treatment and Thrive!</p>
<p>The entire community donates towards this cause, (manhours, donated space, etc), because the ENTIRE COMMUNITY gives of themselves, we are able to keep the doors open for the cost of just 20,000 per year!!! Your gift will help a person with cancer immediately. Big or small just be a part of this. </p>
<p>Help us and our committed volunteers to make a PERMANENT change in the face of aftercare for those diagnosed with cancer.</p>
<p>A new movement in charity: $$ directly effects someone going through cancer every dollar!! PERIOD. </p>
<p>Our little service dog Fonzie works so hard, and he wants to thank you too!</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hello, my name is Elliott Johnson. I am a 5’11”, 128lb 15yr old sophmore who loves to play golf. I work hard everyday trying to improve my game and win more tournaments. I am a scratch golfer and I intend to play collegiate golf after high school.<br/><br/>I recently won a junior golf tournament and have been offered and accepted a $20,000 partial (50%) scholarship to attend the Hank Haney International Junior Golf Academy (IJGA) here in Hilton Head, SC. That leaves $20,000 remaining that must be paid. The academy believes that I have a lot of talent and potential as a golfer. My parents told me that one of the IJGA coach’s commented that “Once Elliott realizes how good he is, he will be unstoppable!” This scholarship is a chance of a lifetime for me.<br/><br/>Here are some facts about my golfing and schooling:</p>
<ul>
<li><span>I took all honors classes in the 9th grade and earned a 4.0 GPA (on a 5.0 GPA scale).</span></li>
<li><span>I played in 6 major tournaments (IJGT, Hurricane, &amp; PJGT) since Dec 2011 with the following 1st round positions:</span></li>
<ul>
<li><span>Three times I led the tournament after day 1.</span></li>
<li><span>One time I was tied for the lead after day 1.</span></li>
<li><span>And, once I was only one stroke behind the lead.</span></li>
</ul>
<li><span>Of these 6 major tournaments, I had a 2nd place finish and a first place finish. </span></li>
<li><span>My current USGA Handicap Index = 0.7 (based on 19 recent rounds)</span></li>
<li><span>My parents and teachers tell me that I am intelligent, respectful, and a well mannered kid.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><br/>The academy’s motto is “Champions are trained, not born”. With your help, I will be able to take advantage of this opportunity to receive world class training that will aid me in reaching my highest potential.  <br/><br/>My parents have paid the $2,500 down payment to get me into the academy; however, we need to raise the remaining funds so that I can complete the entire 2012-13 year. My mom &amp; dad are both taking on extra part time work, but we still need your help...<br/><br/>My goal during this golf season is to show the academy that I am worthy of a full scholarship for my Junior year. With a few more wins under my belt this coming year, I believe I can prove myself worthy of that full scholarship. I intend to train hard, stay focused, and never give up until I reach my goal.</p>

<h3>The teacher program is the KRI Level One Certification program in Kundalini Yoga. Graduates become instructors and learn the fundamental principles &amp; practices of Kundalini yoga. This specific form of yoga strengthens the sympathetic nervous system providing recovery from addiction and assists in psychological regeneration from trauma. It is a wonderful addition to the community as a preventive health practice because each pose targets specific organs, helps prevent osteoporosis, among other diseases associated with ageing and stress.</h3>
<p>I am a 9 year student of advanced yoga and former performing acrobat. I have had the privilege to study privately with a former student, Salvador Broch, of the original Kundalini Yoga teacher in America, Yogi Bajan who introduced it in LA in 1986. After practicing all different types of yoga, I have found Kundalini supersedes the rest and it is becoming a big hit in studios nationwide. My dream is to be able to share the wonderful health benefits of this specific type of yoga as therapy for the community. Yoga teachers and fellow students have all encouraged me to pursue a teacher certification as my dedication has brought my practice level to a point where I can really benefit others. I have taught yoga privately to friends and they are always asking for more! I have taught gymnastics and stand up paddling boarding and my years of waitressing has given me the ability to engage all walks of life with a great positive enthusiastic attitude. I have read countless books on health and nutrition and sold it for a living. What can I say? I’m a flower child .</p>
<p>Yoga benefits all ages. It helps lower stress, prevents illnesses, and permeates beyond the studio to create a more harmonious community as people are more calm and positive in their day to day interactions. The benefits of yoga are exponential including a more graceful ageing, less injuries from increased flexibility, as well as improved circulation and nervous system functioning from the breathing exercises. For me this is a no-brainer! People of all ages benefit from yoga, it increases the ability to focus and cognition.</p>
<p> Your small contribution will not only allow me to fulfill my dream, it will benefit the overall health of the community in a major way. Those that I teach will be inspired to tell their friends and families and so on…the snowball benefit will ensue!</p>
<p><strong>What I Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<p>Let me break it down for you in detail I need $<strong>3,500</strong> for the Kundalini Teacher training certification from 7<sup>th</sup> Chakra Yoga in Huntington Beach, CA that starts September 14 and finishes June 9. It’s a 220 hour including additional yoga classes, practicum, and evaluation. One year membership in IKYTA and website listing is included in the course fee. I will become a certified instructor of Kundalini Yoga and be able to instruct students in yoga and meditation.  </p>
<ul>
<li>I appreciate your contribution! Here is what you get!</li>
</ul>
<p>I will give all contributors of $25 a free hour long in home yoga session if they live within driving distance. Everyone else will be emailed a video link to a full length yoga class taught by me they can practice at home and share with friends and family.</p>
<p>I will also provide 4 free yoga classes valid for one year for contributors of $100 in person or video format.</p>
<p>For all of you who can donate $5 you will be mailed a handwritten postcard with my deepest heartfelt gratitude!</p>
<ul>
<li>If I do not reach my entire goal, I will postpone the teacher training until 2013 and use the put the funds raised towards the certification.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>This project is valuable to me because as a yoga teacher I will be able to supplement my income with something beneficial to the community and myself instead of waitressing working in restaurants which I have been doing since I was 15 years old. I currently work 75 hours a week!

</ul></span></div>","The Basics.
The teacher program is the KRI Level One Certification program in Kundalini Yoga. Graduates become instructors and learn the fundamental principles & practices of Kundalini yoga. This specific form of yoga strengthens the sympathetic nervous system providing recovery from addiction and assists in psychological regeneration from trauma. It is a wonderful addition to the community as a preventive health practice because each pose targets specific organs, helps prevent osteoporosis, among other diseases associated with ageing and stress.
I am a 9 year student of advanced yoga and former performing acrobat. I have had the privilege to study privately with a former student, Salvador Broch, of the original Kundalini Yoga teacher in America, Yogi Bajan who introduced it in LA in 1986. After practicing all different types of yoga, I have found Kundalini supersedes the rest and it is becoming a big hit in studios nationwide. My dream is to be able to share the wonderful health benefits of this specific type of yoga as therapy for the community. Yoga teachers and fellow students have all encouraged me to pursue a teacher certification as my dedication has brought my practice level to a point where I can really benefit others. I have taught yoga privately to friends and they are always asking for more! I have taught gymnastics and stand up paddling boarding and my years of waitressing has given me the ability to engage all walks of life with a great positive enthusiastic attitude. I have read countless books on health and nutrition and sold it for a living. What can I say? I’m a flower child .
Yoga benefits all ages. It helps lower stress, prevents illnesses, and permeates beyond the studio to create a more harmonious community as people are more calm and positive in their day to day interactions. The benefits of yoga are exponential including a more graceful ageing, less injuries from increased flexibility, as well as improved circulation and nervous system functioning from the breathing exercises. For me this is a no-brainer! People of all ages benefit from yoga, it increases the ability to focus and cognition.
 Your small contribution will not only allow me to fulfill my dream, it will benefit the overall health of the community in a major way. Those that I teach will be inspired to tell their friends and families and so on…the snowball benefit will ensue!
What I Need & What You Get
Let me break it down for you in detail I need $3,500 for the Kundalini Teacher training certification from 7th Chakra Yoga in Huntington Beach, CA that starts September 14 and finishes June 9. It’s a 220 hour including additional yoga classes, practicum, and evaluation. One year membership in IKYTA and website listing is included in the course fee. I will become a certified instructor of Kundalini Yoga and be able to instruct students in yoga and meditation.  

I appreciate your contribution! Here is what you get!

I will give all contributors of $25 a free hour long in home yoga session if they live within driving distance. Everyone else will be emailed a video link to a full length yoga class taught by me they can practice at home and share with friends and family.
I will also provide 4 free yoga classes valid for one year for contributors of $100 in person or video format.
For all of you who can donate $5 you will be mailed a handwritten postcard with my deepest heartfelt gratitude!

If I do not reach my entire goal, I will postpone the teacher training until 2013 and use the put the funds raised towards the certification.

The Impact

This project is valuable to me because as a yoga teacher I will be able to supplement my income with something beneficial to the community and myself instead of waitressing working in restaurants which I have been doing since I was 15 years old. I currently work 75 hours a week! Those of you who know me can attest to my knowledge of health and passion for yoga as a contagious benefit for those struggling with their physical or spiritual progress. Beyond my personal goals, this project benefits the community by providing preventive health, promoting a healthy lifestyle, and more holistic habits.
I have worked for famous Health Guru Dr. Andrew Weil’s skyrocketing health food restaurant chain as well as two organic food stores where my passion and knowledge helped many people gain knowledge that dramatically changed their lives for the better. Whether it be a relationship that improved because they we able to reckognize and deal with their stress or an injury prevented because they are not stiff, there are so many positive applications to yoga.
I am dedicated to yoga and teaching people how much better they feel by keeping mobile and flexible. I have so much positive energy to give people, I just need you to help me help others.

A personal note from Noggin Sport:
 Over the past few days and weeks we have come to get to know a young man named Damon Janes and his family and friends. 
It’s amazing to me, what started out as a simple gesture of kindness has now
turned into a full-blown passion to pay it forward.
 After speaking to Damons family and
friends, I have come to know that Damon is someone who lived life to the
fullest and always gave  110% to the fullest meaning of the expression
 As the saying goes, the apple doesn’t
fall far from the tree, I have found this to be very true in this case from
speaking with his parents and friends. They have a passion for Damon and a
drive that is also 110%
 From riding to football, to helping
friends and making them smile and laugh. It seems to me that Damon did it to
the fullest and from the footage and messages I have seen and read its clear his
friends held him in highest regard. He was truly loved by the people around
him.
 110% is not just a number it’s a
commitment, a passion inside you that is contiguous. It seems that Damon was
that for sure.  In reading all of the letters of support its clear to me
that Damon was and will be remembered for being a go getter and person of
respect and a passion for life.  This is true of his parents, the apple
they raised was a golden one for sure.
 On a personal note this passed week has
inspired us to try and achieve more in life by contributing to try and make a
difference in young mans and his families life so that he not be
forgotten.

thoughts are with you, to Mark who seems to be to be the rock and foundation

..............................................................................................................................................
Noggin Sport is a company in Ontario Canada that is
looking to make a difference in sports and safety, in regards to concussion
awareness and CTE. The Noggin is a fully
tested piece of protective garment. Everyone knows someone who has had some form
of a concussion either from sports, a slip or a fall. They know firsthand the devastating effects
it can have on your body and mind.




 Every year millions of head injuries happen in sports. Millions of dollars are lost in pro athletics
salaries, regular salaries, as well as
medical expenses.





 More importantly the youth of today are at risk for more
head trauma. Games are faster, athletes
are bigger and equipment needs to catch up.



 
The Noggin`s goal is to make the Noggin a mandatory piece of
safety equipment in all contact sports that require helmets.



 
With your contribution, we can help provide an athlete with
more safety and awareness and help minimize the risk of concussions and long
term CTE.



 
Millions of athletes today play contact sports and think, ""I
will never get hurt"", and have a, ""I will live forever"" mentality. The fact is concussions and CTE’s are
becoming a major concern in the sporting world and medical community.



 
What Noggin requires and what you get in
return.
 
Noggin is seeking to raise $80,000 dollars to provide noggins to players in minor sports, globally. This money raised will help us provide players with better head
protection and additional research and development to find new and better ways to try and prevent concussion related injuries 

 
No donation is too small or too large. The plan is to make sure that for every
$40.00 generated Noggin will donate $5 directly to the Damon Janes Foundation and will either send you 1 Noggin skull cap  or donate it to a minor sports team of your choice. Most importantly we will be creating
awareness for CTE and concussions.


 
The money generated from this drive will go to the Damon Janes Foundation and  back into noggin
for more research and development. It
will also go into creating a partnership with much needed groups that are in
support of concussion research and CTE.


 
Many levels of donations are accepted. You also have the ability to be able to help
provide a full team or league with a minimum order of 600 Noggins. The Noggin company will put your company logo
and branding on each noggin bands for all players to see and use for the entire
year.


 
THE IMPACT
 
Noggin is fully aware that the prevention of concussions is
an on going fight. But we firmly believe
this product will help with the long term fight against head trauma and the
long term effect of CTE.  Many souls have
been lost to the fight of CTE.  Some
famous athletes have lost battles with CTE. 
Being able to provide the youth of today and the future stars with better
safety equipment should be the goal of every sporting good manufacturer.


 
With your donation and passing on this site information  to your friends, family, neighbours and co-workers,
 we can easily obtain the goal we
set.  Please also remember it does not
have to be just $ 80,000 raised.  The
goal is to try and provide as many noggins as possible to as many kids in the next 60 days. So please pass this on.



 
Together we can make a difference.  Change is hard, but those with vision can
accept and promote safety in sports. Lets join together to make a difference, no donation is too small, no
email will go unanswered.  Pass this on,
let’s lead the fight to protect and preserve the sports and athletes we love.",1.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>About Alfie's Life</h3>
<div>
<p>Alfie was born with several health problems including autistic characteristics, adrenogenital syndrome, borderline echolalia, and neurological impairment. He never let these hold him back, though. With the love and support of his mom, Cheryl, he grew to be a man who loved and cared for people like no other. His love for God was evident in everything he did in life. On March 22, 2013, at the age of 38, Alfie went into cardiac arrest and woke up in a world where he now has a brand new, perfect body.</p>
<p>Cheryl has been an amazing mother, pushing Alfie to be better and better, advocating for him in every area of his life, and making sure all of his medical needs were met even when health insurance wouldn't cover expenses. As a single mom, Cheryl has struggled for years to provide for Alfie and all of his needs. Cheryl is left with medical bills and now  funeral expenses.</p>
<p>Contributing to this campaign will help relieve Cheryl of a financial burden, enabling her to grieve for her son. Any money raised above Alfie's funeral expenses will go toward medical bills that have added up over the years. Please give to Alfie as he gave to us all through out his short, yet full life.</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Our Goal</h3>
<p>As Cheryl is left with immense grief, we want to help alleviate a small piece of her financial burdens. The goal was set low, but we would LOVE to see Cheryl's thousands of dollars of debt eliminated. This would help give her some peace as she grieves. </p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Alfie's biggest concern was always his mom. He wanted to make sure she was well provided for. We can now step in and make sure Cheryl is taken care of.</p>
<p> </p>

<p>Kansainvälisten tapahtumien järjestäminen on kallista puuhaa. Erityisesti ulkomaalaiste huippuottelijoiden Suomeen tuominen on iso menoerä tapahtumalle. Tämän kampanjan tarkoitus on minimoida taloudellista painetta tapahtuman järjestämisen suhteen. Tavoitteena on kerätä vähintään 10000 euroa, saadaksemme katettua suurin osan ottelijakuluista. Tämä ei kata koko illan kuluja mutta se riittää takeeksi siitä, että seuramme ei joudu konkurssiin. Samalla kampanja toimii hyvänä mittarina sille, onko tällaisille tapahtumille tilausta.</p>
<p>Mitä paremmin kampanja onnistuu, sitä enemmän meidän on mahdollista panostaa puitteisiin ja tehdä tapahtumasta vieläkin viihdyttävämpi. Osallistumalla tähän kamppanjaan annat äänesi tapahtuman ja Suomalaisen thainyrkkeilyn kehityksen puolesta. Ja vaikka kamppanja ei saavuttaisikaan tavoitettaan niin se järjestetään joka tapauksessa.</p>

Tarvitsemme sinun apuasi

Kansainvälisten tapahtumien järjestäminen on kallista puuhaa. Erityisesti ulkomaalaiste huippuottelijoiden Suomeen tuominen on iso menoerä tapahtumalle. Tämän kampanjan tarkoitus on minimoida taloudellista painetta tapahtuman järjestämisen suhteen. Tavoitteena on kerätä vähintään 10000 euroa, saadaksemme katettua suurin osan ottelijakuluista. Tämä ei kata koko illan kuluja mutta se riittää takeeksi siitä, että seuramme ei joudu konkurssiin. Samalla kampanja toimii hyvänä mittarina sille, onko tällaisille tapahtumille tilausta.
Mitä paremmin kampanja onnistuu, sitä enemmän meidän on mahdollista panostaa puitteisiin ja tehdä tapahtumasta vieläkin viihdyttävämpi. Osallistumalla tähän kamppanjaan annat äänesi tapahtuman ja Suomalaisen thainyrkkeilyn kehityksen puolesta. Ja vaikka kamppanja ei saavuttaisikaan tavoitettaan niin se järjestetään joka tapauksessa.
Miten voit auttaa

Helpoin tapaa tukea tapahtumaa on ostaa lippu joko itsellesi tai kaverillesi tämän kampanjan kautta. Rahansiirto tapahtuu luotettavasti PayPal-palvelun kautta. Sinulla ei tarvitse olla olemassa PayPal-tiliä voidaksesi maksaa. Riittää, että sinulla on luottokortti tai verkkomaksuominaisuudella varustettu Debit kortti kuten Visa-electron. Erilaiset vaihtoehdot osallistumiseen löytyvät sivun oikeasta reunasta. Kun tilaat jonkun tarjotuista vaihtoehdoista saat sähköpostitse tiedot tilauksen lunastamisesta. Kiitos!
Mikäli haluat tukea tapahtumaa mutta et pääse paikan päälle niin voit myös osallistua ostamalla tapahtuman erikoisjulisteen (julisteen esiversio kuvassa oikealla). Erikoisjulisteen hinta on 6 euroa ja sisältää postituskulut Suomeen. Julisteeseen tulee erottuva teksti ""Minä tuen thainyrkkeilyä"". Erikoisjulisteen saa tilattua vain tämän kamppanjan kautta.
Lisäksi voit auttaa jakamalla tietoa tästä kampanjasta eteenpäin! Facebook, Twitter, Google+, blogi tai vaikka omat kotisivusi ovat kaikki kelpo paikkoja tähän tarkoitukseen.
Treenamalla thainyrkkeilyä tuet Suomalaista thainyrkkeilyä ja pidät itsesi kunnossa. Suomen Thainyrkkeilyliiton sivuilta löydät itsellesi parhaiten sopivan seuran, jotka järjestävät thainyrkkeilyn peruskursseja ympäri vuoden.
Mitä jos?
Mitä jos suosikkiottelijasi ottelu peruuntuu vaikka loukkaantumisen takia? Entä jos ottelulistalla tulee muutoksia? Kamppailu-urheilussa sattuu ja tapahtuu emmekä voi taata, että ottelukortti pysyy muuttumattomana. Voimme kuitenkin vakuuttaa, että muutosten sattuessa teemme parhaamme pitääksemme ottelijaparit mielenkiintoisina. Se on meille elinehto koska haluamme järjestää vastaavia tapahtumia myös jatkossa!

Mikä ihmeen King of the Ring?
King of the Ring on Helsinkiläinen thainyrkkeilyseura joka toimii Kaapelitehtaalla Ruoholahdessa. Seura on voittoa tavoittelematon yhdistys. Seuran tehtävänä on opettaa thainyrkkeilyä ja tehdä lajia tunnetuksi Suomessa. 
King of the Ring perustettiin vuonna 2000 elävän thainyrkkeilylegendan ja moninkertaisen ammattilaisten maailmanmestarin Mr. Jomhod Kiatadisakin toimesta. Jomhod on kotoisin Thaimaasta ja asui yli 10 vuotta Suomessa opettaen thainyrkkeilyä.

Tapahtuman historia
King of the Ring järjesti ensimmäisen kansainvälisen thainyrkkeily -tapahtumansa jo vuonna 2001. Tapahtuma oli menestys. Seuraava Thaiboxing Night -tapahtuma järjestettiin heti seuraavana vuonna 2002. Nyt tauon jälkeen olemme valmiit herättämään Thaiboxing Night -thainyrkkeilytapahtumat jälleen henkiin. Ajat ovat muuttuneet mutta rakkaus lajiin on edelleen vahva!


Khop Khun Khrap - Kiitos!

<p>Youth Tennis Project provides custom tennis rackets to kids to use for free in our public courts. Our goal is to get 250,000 tennis rackets to kids. Every accumulation of $100.00 we will give a custom tennis racket to the kids. We will work alongside the USTA partners to distribute these rackets.</p>
<p>Over the past three decades, childhood obeseity rates in America have tripled and today, nearly one in three children in America are overweight or obese. The numbers are even higher in African American and Hispanic communities, where nearly 40% of childeren are overweight or obese.</p>
<p>Even though these numbers are grim, we can start making a change.</p>
<p>I've been involved in tennis for years and it frustrated me that we're not doing more to make tennis fun and attractive for kids.</p>
<p>So I developed a process to custom wrap tennis racket frames using liquid printing. It took trial and error, but when we got it right it was amazing. It looked so cool that I thought this is a chance for all kids to belong to a tennis club... the youth tennis project club!</p>
<p>There are thousands of municipal tennis courts all over the country that aren't being fully utilized. Funding for school sports programs continue to be cut leaving kids inactive.</p>
<p>Kids don't need a fancy tennis club they just need a racket to be part of a global tennis community. Kids just need a chance.</p>
<p>The cool custom rackets give the kids a spark to get them out to our parks and free tennis courts. Playing for free and belonging to a global tennis club.</p>
<p>Next we offer a recycling program on old unwanted rackets that we may refurbish these rackets or work with ITA to recycle your racket ecologically. This will reduce landfill and help our environment.</p>
<p>We have a GREAT team with a ton of talent to get this project accomplished. We are working in a limited space with homemade equipment built by our amazing engineer/artist. Our processing equipment has been constructed from old barrels, rice cookers, and shopping carts. The equipment needed is readily avalible from US companies to streamline the process. As you can see from the video we are able to create an amazing tennis racket, but we need to modernize.</p>
<p>The usage of funds will go to get equipment upgrades, tennis rackets, printable film, painting supplies and pay our talented artist. As you see we have a nominal start up amount but it will allow us to get started.</p>
<p>As you may have noticed kids are getting a raw deal in this country. The funding cuts in schools are running rampide. It is up to more fortunate indidviduals to look outside government and use our create ability to help kids in this country.</p>
<p>Together we can do our part. Thanks for your time. Nate, Trent, Marc, Charlie, Happy and of course the kids.</p></div>","Youth Tennis Project

<h2><strong>My Life Before<br/></strong></h2>
<p><strong>I started experiencing an increasing number of strange symptoms in 1996, while working as an elementary teacher on an Indian reservation in New Mexico.</strong>  I mistook the nymphal stage tick that bit me for a mysteriously-disappearing freckle, and the huge expanding rash on my calf for a spider-bite!  I knew nothing of Lyme disease at that time, and neither did the many doctors I saw about the bizarre symptoms that kept developing over the last 15 years. It started with chronic sinus problems and often-painful lymph nodes, then progressed to succumbing to every flu and cold that came along at school, then moved on to fainting, extra heartbeats and palpitations, unexplained ""anxiety attacks"" with shortness of breath and tightness in the chest, neuropathy, tinnitus, nausea, vertigo, depression, back pain, and dozens more symptoms--three pages of symptoms! </p>
<p> </p>
<h2>""Miss Diagnosed"" or ""Ms. Teree Illness"" (LOL)</h2>
<p>While suspicious that all these crazy symptoms were connected somehow, I could not prove it. I received numerous misdiagnoses and separate explanations for each sudden strange symptom, and many doctors just shrugged their shoulders!  Lyme Disease affects every system, organ, and tissue in the body, so is often misdiagnosed as M.S., ALS, Lupus, Fibromyalgia, Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, Sjogren's Syndrome, and many others illnesses.  <strong>Shortly after moving to North Carolina a few years ago the fatigue, pain, and new cardiac symptoms  finally became so disabling that I spent months researching each weird symptom of my ""mystery illness"" until I found a common denominator--and a photo of a Lyme rash just like my rash from years ago. It was only then that I was able to seek treatment with the appropriate specialist.</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<h2>I Need Your Help</h2>
<p>Left unchecked for so long, the bacteria that cause Lyme Disease are now firmly entrenched and in my brain as well, and will require years of treatment to bring under control.  <strong> While it is a relief to have a diagnosis at last, I can no longer afford the doctor visits and medicines nor health insurance to treat it; like many Lyme sufferers, I spent over $10,000 seeking diagnosis in the last 4 years, and am now broke, unable to work, and have already sold much of my furniture and belongings.  </strong>Without medication, my symptoms have gotten worse, and I am starting to have trouble walking, functioning, and am losing my hearing, in addition to developing more neurological symptoms, frequent migraines, and periods of mental disorganization.  I have had to move in with my parents, which is a burden to their very limited retirement finances, and they cannot afford to pay for my medical needs either.</p>
<h3>With the appropriate I.V. antibiotics I may speed recovery by years, but this is very expensive, over $1,000 a month for at least 8 months, plus the $700 cost of setting up the PICC line, monthly doctor visits, and regular monitoring.  If my fundraising goal is not met I can still resume doctor visits and oral antibiotics to halt the proliferation of the bacteria which will improve my symptoms, and in time reverse them.  Your contribution will make the difference between medical treatment and continued decline for me, and any amount will be greatly appreciated! </h3>

<h2>Dream Catcher Thank-You Perk</h2>
<p><strong>I have chosen to make dream catchers as my thank-you gifts because they are meant to encourage the good dreams, much as your help will bring back the hope needed for me to dream realistically of recovery from this horrible and debilitating illness.</strong>  The reality of returning to the classroom or to my work with the National Park Service or rejoining the volunteer fire department is not out of the realm of possibility, but the hope is fading with lack of medical treatment.</p>
<p>While dream catchers originally were made by Plains tribes,  I was taught how to make them by an Indian woman from Laguna Pueblo many years ago in New Mexico, and despite inflammation in my fingers I still enjoy the zen of making them.  I make them with metal hoops wrapped in leather strips, with intricate seed beadwork and feathers. </p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Walk in Beauty</h2>
<p>I want so much to be one of those optimistic patients who talk about their hopes and dreams for the future when they are well, and <strong>your help will get me onto the path of recovery so I might ""Walk in Beauty,"" a Navajo description of a healthy life.</strong> My hope is to force my illness into remission enough to work again.  My dream is to return to New Mexico as that is where home is.  <strong>I thank you for considering my cause, and for any contribution you choose to make.</strong></p>

<p>Hello, I am Vandi Frame-Arnold, Craig Maddy's Mom.  Craig is my only child and has been, from the moment he was born six weeks too soon, a handful but the cutest and best son a mother could wish to have.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Craig was a great kid growing up.  He really was the all American boy: into sports, bugs, creepy things, exploring swamps, riding his bike around, playing with his dog or collecting sticks to make into a creative variety of spears and swords.  He always had questions and was quite intellectually curious from a young age.  Ethics and being a good citizen were topics of especial interest to Craig, who has always held himself to the highest standards. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>An example of Craig's character which sums him up is his volunteering to stay an extra 6 weeks in Afghanistan so that another Marine could rush to his ailing father's side.  When Craig told me the news, he said he just couldn't bear the shame if he didn't stand up when asked.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Corporal Craig Scott Maddy, USMC was brutally attacked and shot in the head by persons unknown in the early hours of December 6, 2012 in the small town of Desert Hot Springs CA.  He was stationed in 29 Palms USMC Base after returning in October 2012 from deployment to Afghanistan, where he worked as a machine gunner and went on over 300 combat missions including heavy participation in Operation Jaws.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Craig has been described as the ""heart and soul"" of his company, the Suicide Charley's of the 1/7, and he personifies the term ""good Marine."" He is selfless, modest, driven and extremely goal oriented.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Craig's Dad (John) and Mom (Vandi) were told he would not survive the day after he was shot, but four weeks later he continues to defy the odds by improving steadily albeit very slowly as is typical with this type of traumatic brain injury.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Craig has always been a real go-getter and it was clear to all that he would excel at any path he chose; therefore his parents are determined to gather the funds necessary to ensure Craig receive the best possible recovery care to help him overcome what was termed a ""non recoverable wound.""  Craig will have many needs, first and foremost being a home to live in.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Craig's Mom loves him with all her heart and he is her only child. While she is quite willing, in fact honored, to care for Craig, she also is aging and won't live forever. So Craig will need funds enough to be cared for professionally if need be, for the rest of his life.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Everyone who knows Corporal Maddy thinks he will not only survive this horrific attack, but will make a full recovery. But it is always best to only hope for the best, but plan for the worst.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Therefore Craig Maddy's Dad and Mom humbly ask you to contribute financially as much as you can easily afford in order to help a young Marine injured by bad men for no reason.  He needs a home to live in and funds to support him.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Thank you so much for your generosity. May God's Blessing be upon you all!</p>

 are a yoga wear company founded by two knitwear designers and yoga 
lovers!! Living in New York City we were surrounded by black yoga pants 
in our classes (and on the street). We thought why are so many of us 
(yes we do it too!) wearing all black, petroleum (these things will be 
around way after we stop wearing them to class) and even see through 
pants! We realized we needed better options. We wanted colorful 
fashionable pants that would be great for yoga AND carry us into the 
rest of our day. We thought wouldn’t it be great to not only make 
amazing clothes but do it with yogic values to help our community. So we
 created Mudita Design. We have brought forth a collection that fits 
great, is made in an environmentally conscious way, gives back to the 
community, and has a unique flare! </p></span></span></span></h4>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Memcine is a small biotech company with a patent-pending technology that will enable patient-specific tumor therapy.  Our technology, known as Immunoplex, can be used to create individualized vaccines that are able to ramp up the immune response against a patient's tumor.  Imagine, a technology that, within hours, can be used to create a vaccine for anyone's tumor!  Our technology truly is personalized medicine.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Memcine was recently awarded up to $500,000 from the State of Iowa based on our scientific data and commercialization plan; however, we need matching funds to receive the money.  We estimate that a total of $500,000 will be needed to mature our research portfolio, allowing us to bring in strategic funding partners.  That's why our target is $250,000.  We will use this $250,000 and matching state funds for a total of $500K.  This money will allow us to add to our existing data package.  Just think, for every dollar you donate, its like donating 2!  The money will go to additional research and development of the technology.</p>
<p>Sadly we can't offer gadgets for your donations.  We have instead provided non-traditional perks in exchange for your donations.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Immunoplex technology is based on decades of research showing the benefits of antibody coated tumor cells in inducing an anti-tumor response.  Our technology was developed to streamline the process and universalize production of the antibody coated tumor cells from any patient.  This therapy has the promise of being effective, with the added bonus of having little to no side-effects.  Just think!  A cancer treatment that doesn't have debilitating side-effects and helps reduce tumor size and metastasis!  Your dollars will go toward non-animal mechanistic studies and stability assays required for new drugs and therapies submitted to the FDA.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Even if you don't want to or can't donate, pass the word along to others that may have an interest in our technology and the promise of patient-driven personalized tumor therapy.   We don't want to go down the path of tear-jerking... we all know how important this is.</p></span></span></span></span></div>","Short Summary

<p>CedarLight Grove, ADF
is an experiment in Urban Druidry located in Baltimore, MD which has grown and
flourished since its establishment in 1990 by our founder, Will Pierson. In 1996,
CLG procured its own, permanent sanctuary in northern Baltimore City to provide
a place of worship that serves the whole Pagan community. CLG continues to be
an active member of that community, running charity events and fundraisers
including (but not limited to!) cleaning up local neglected graveyards,
cleaning up local streams, raising money for Child’s Play, collecting goods for
natural disaster victims and the House of Ruth, even collecting money for the
Orpheus Pagan Chamber Choir. We’ve even been featured in the New York Times!: <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/31/garden/if-a-druid-rings-the-doorbell.html?smid=pl-share&amp;_r=0"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">If a Druid Rings a Doorbell</a>.</p>
<p>Alas, Pagan sanctuaries
require much painstaking love and care to keep them running! They do not run on
prayers and faith alone (though sometimes we try with a lot of incense…that
hasn’t worked yet…). This year alone we’ve taken on a huge project to remove lead
from the building (more information on that below). So, we need some help from
the community we bend over backwards to support! We’re running a fundraiser to
help recoop the costs of several maintenance projects we’ve held this year and
keep CedarLight Grove open to the public! AND you get a chance help plan our
Winter Solstice ritual too! ;)</p>
<p><b>Winter Solstice/Saturnalia/Topsy Turvy Fun for
You!</b></p>
<p>Every year for the
Winter Solstice, we hold an all-night vigil in which we stay up all night with
laughter and good cheer to make sure the sun rising again in the morning! This
year for our main rite, we will be celebrating Saturnalia style with a Topsy
Turvy rite meant to lift the spirit and petition the Kindred for “Joyful Prosperity
for the Folk of the Gods”! BUT, we need help planning!</p>
<p>So this is where YOU
come in! (Yes you, and you…also you waving your hand over there!) For our
fundraiser, we’ve come up with several goals of things we would like to for our
holiday! If we are able to collectively fundraise each of these goals, then
that we means YOU have helped us decide on how we’re going to celebrate our
Winter Solstice High Rite this year on Saturday, December 21<sup>st</sup>. </p>
<p>The decisions we need

<p>Additionally, for anyone who donates at least $100, they will receive

of photographs and original poetry by our very own artistic membership!</p>
<p>By the way, CedarLight Grove, ADF is a registered non-profit
charity, so any donations you make are tax deductible!</p>
<p><b>The Impact</b></p>
<p>Owning any kind of building
is fraught with perils and danger. Our membership valiantly battles against all
odds to keep things at CLG running! The age of the CedarLight Center, where we
hold all of our events, classes, and rites, requires frequent maintenance. The
building still has lead paint in certain parts of it, and as mentioned above, we
just recently under took a huge project to remove the lead paint from one of
our apartments upstairs that we rent out. The project has been a long time coming!
By removing the lead in that one part, we’ve helped make the building safer!</p>
<p>Just recently we also
had to have a new toilet and sink installed in our bathrooms, and had a brand
to new sump pump well dug out to save our Senior Druid and Building Manager
from having to bail out a basement flooded knee deep with buckets in the middle
of the night during a hurricane again! (Yes, they actually did that last year…)</p>
<p>That old phrase “blood,
sweat, and tears” is hugely appropriate to the work that our Witan and
membership put in to keep CedarLight Grove a part of the community, to run classes
and workshops, to run a monthly Reiki share, and to host other Pagan groups. We
have people who travel 2+ hours just to attend our rituals and some our high
rites see around 40-50 people in attendance (which is a lot if you’ve seen the
size of our parsonage!). We’ve succeeded in becoming an integral part of the
community, which we couldn’t have done without the dedication of these people.</p>
<p>Any money you are able
to donate will be an immense help to keep CedarLight Grove alive and thriving
as we continue to serve the Kindred and the community the best that we are
able. We love all of you, and hope that you will love us in return! Any little
bit helps, even if it’s only a couple dollars!</p>
<p><b>Other Ways You Can Help</b></p>
<p>If you can’t donate,
no sweat! We know how the economy is right now. You can help us in other ways.
Please share our campaign with your friends and family! Post about us on
Facebook, Twitter, or wherever else you can think of! There are links on this
very page you can use to save you some time.</p>
<p>And if you’re able,
feel free to join us on Saturday, December 21<sup>st</sup> for our Winter
Solstice Celebration! More details will be available soon on our website, <a href=""http://www.cedarlightgrove.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.cedarlightgrove.org</a> as

<h3>Why this appeals to you:<br/>
</h3>
<p>Our mission is to not only revolutionize how we see moods, but to create something we can <b>all</b> get behind. Tha Cure will be on the forefront of mood-based media solutions, as it will be aiming to be the first platform to define and fix a user's particular mood. We feel this will not only give our idea a greater chance of success, it will also ensure its sustainability. <br/></p>
<p>Tha Cure is designed to incorporate an array of moods ranging anywhere from feeling rejected to ecstatic. This means that whatever mood you are in, or want to be in, we have you covered. Similar to social media, Tha Cure will enable its users to publish a wide variety of relative and popular content from across the globe. However, our platform will provide its users with a <b>new</b> way of relating to the vast world of media - with mood-targeted content. Our intent with this was to engineer a change for how we both discover and enjoy media on a day-to-day basis. We aim to do this by more deeply relating the most popular forms of media to what drives our very thoughts and actions, our emotions.<br/></p>

<h3>Tha Vision:<br/>
</h3>
<p>Ideally our hope is to grow Tha Cure into a nationally, if not globally recognized non-profit. As mentioned, we wanted to create something <b>everyone</b> could not only benefit from, but also be involved with. Building this app will open countless opportunities to make a positive impact on disease, ultimately allowing us to donate truly significant amounts to research for a cure.<br/></p>
<p>Initially we will only be donating 10% of the proceeds to research organizations. As this will allow us to use the remaining revenue to grow the idea much faster, and conclusively ensure a lasting future for the concept. With mobile application profits capable of exceeding over<b> $47,000</b> per <b>DAY</b>, just imagine the impact we could make in only <b>one</b> year! (That's over <b>$16 MILLION dollars!</b>). But let's not get sidetracked here with what could be... let's focus on what we have - a fun and innovative idea.<br/></p>

<h3>What we want/need: <br/>
</h3>In order to incorporate the app's necessary features, we need to hire a team of skilled developers that will help design, create, build, and market this idea. In accordance, we have chosen to use a top-notch app development company: (<a href=""www.fueled.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.fueled.com</a>)<br/><br/>Our thought process behind this is to ensure every nook and cranny of our vision is magnificently brought to life. We wanted to be able to work closely with our idea as it develops, and to be there to shape it into something timeless. So after speaking with countless local app development companies, we concluded that Fuelded by far surpassed this standard. They make it their priority to work with their clients, and carefully develop their projects into world class applications. (The kind of apps that are featured in the top 100 in the App Store).<br/><br/>Sadly, this comes at a price... a pretty steep one might we add. ($200,000)  Anyway, we have chosen to set a more reasonable goal that will allow us to still create our vision. Our plan is to outsource the development of this app to companies located overseas (this will allow us to build it much cheaper). The only issue with this is, typically it's a bit more difficult to direct the development of an idea this complex over phone calls and emails. Doable, but a little more challenging. <br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/13308/files/20130815001657-2e0d9287ee729f492f37d4b70381e5e6_large.png?1376551017"" src="""" style=""width: 615.858px; height: 489px;""/></p>Either way, we are determined to make sure our vision is not only realized, but guaranteed to make a positive impact in accordance with our mission.

I'm the creator of the Power 20 Method, and my company is tiny but my solutions to health are big. My competitors are huge pharmaceutical companies with deep-pocketed, well marketed diet brands. Meanwhile, I work in a shared workspace for health-tech companies called Blueprint Health in NYC, and so far I have avoided all outside funding. <p></p>
<p>
</p><p>I’m building a new kind of health company - one that’s focused on prevention, not pill popping. </p>
<p>
</p><h2><b>It’s not easy, it’s not sexy, but it works.</b></h2>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">The Power 20 Method is a reasonable response to an unreasonable world. No single supplement or specific routine can solve all our health woes. If we want to be healthy, we have to address every aspect of our lives: how we sleep, what we eat, how we socialize, how we move, and even how we see ourselves.</span><br/></p><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""></span></p><h2>The Method is constantly being tested and improved on. </h2><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/274639/files/20131222141652-scale-1.jpg?1387750612"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">We spent the past year testing the Power 20 Method. We've learned that the benefits go beyond weight loss to include:</span></p><ul>
<li>Improved strength.</li>
<li>Better balance.</li>
<li>Better waist-to-hip ratio.</li>
<li>Improved alertness.</li>
<li>Better mood.</li>
<li>Fewer cravings.</li>
</ul><p></p>
<p>
</p><h2><b>Help me break through the noise. </b></h2>
<p>There’s a huge amount of misinformation out there about what makes us unhealthy and what is actually good for us. The Power 20 Method looks beyond fad diets, and relies on evidence we see in both labs and our own users. Though it's far easier to sell a pill than to improve a lifestyle, we've decided to take the harder path.</p><h2>Your contribution will fund the printing of the guides and the design of the packaging.</h2><p>Important parts of the project are already done.

Fat cells get larger when they're filled with triglycerides. Triglycerides are three units of glycerol bound together. When they're bound together, they are too big to escape from inside the fat cell. Only when they are unbound, or broken down into fatty acids, are these small enough to pass through the fat cell walls to be used for energy. Breaking down triglycerides is the key to shrinking fat cells, which is in turn the key to revealing that six pack or toning up that butt. <p><br/></p><h2>It works because it's truly holistic.</h2><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/277635/files/20131224170216-P20_Holistic_Graphic.png?1387933336"" src="""" style=""""/></p>There are no short cuts when it comes to a healthy lifestyle.

</div></div>","We can do this together. 
Hi, I’m Arshad. I'm the creator of the Power 20 Method, and my company is tiny but my solutions to health are big. My competitors are huge pharmaceutical companies with deep-pocketed, well marketed diet brands. Meanwhile, I work in a shared workspace for health-tech companies called Blueprint Health in NYC, and so far I have avoided all outside funding. 

I’m building a new kind of health company - one that’s focused on prevention, not pill popping. 

It’s not easy, it’s not sexy, but it works.
The Power 20 Method is a reasonable response to an unreasonable world. No single supplement or specific routine can solve all our health woes. If we want to be healthy, we have to address every aspect of our lives: how we sleep, what we eat, how we socialize, how we move, and even how we see ourselves.The Method is constantly being tested and improved on. We spent the past year testing the Power 20 Method. We've learned that the benefits go beyond weight loss to include:
Improved strength.
Better balance.
Better waist-to-hip ratio.
Improved alertness.
Better mood.
Fewer cravings.


Help me break through the noise. 
There’s a huge amount of misinformation out there about what makes us unhealthy and what is actually good for us. The Power 20 Method looks beyond fad diets, and relies on evidence we see in both labs and our own users. Though it's far easier to sell a pill than to improve a lifestyle, we've decided to take the harder path.Your contribution will fund the printing of the guides and the design of the packaging.Important parts of the project are already done. We've already launched the workout apps, have created all audio guides, and now we just need to fund the physical products.  It works because it lowers blood sugar and breaks down triglycerides. The Power 20 Method and diet is designed to reduce the size of your fat cells very quickly. Fat cells get larger when they're filled with triglycerides. Triglycerides are three units of glycerol bound together. When they're bound together, they are too big to escape from inside the fat cell. Only when they are unbound, or broken down into fatty acids, are these small enough to pass through the fat cell walls to be used for energy. Breaking down triglycerides is the key to shrinking fat cells, which is in turn the key to revealing that six pack or toning up that butt. It works because it's truly holistic.There are no short cuts when it comes to a healthy lifestyle. Different parts of your life are interrelated, which is why the Power 20 Method touches on so many aspects.

Diet. You'll get a comprehensive diet plan and green tea to have with breakfast. 

Exercise. You'll use the Power 20 workout apps, which are designed to improve your insulin response. 

Sleep. You'll get sleep hypnotherapy tracks that help you fall asleep faster and stay asleep through the night. 

Stress. You'll get guided meditation designed to help you adhere to the program and lower stress.

Social Support. You'll get the Social Support  as part of the Guide, so if you to the Power 20 Method with friends, you'll see better results. 
Doctors & health experts support this method. The reason we've received accolades from doctors and experts in diabetes is because we're offering a specific solution. When a doctor says to eat right and exercise, the Power 20 Method gives patients the precise instructions. For these reasons, we've been getting respect from the health and tech community.Other products I've built are popular and effective.The Power 20 Method is an extension of the very popular Power 20 Workout App. You can find the Power 20 app on Android and iOS devices. There are now over 100,000 users of the app, and we have multiple versions. I've spent my life looking for ways to improve life at work and at home.I started a company called MetroNaps 10 years ago because I saw that people were suffering from sleep deprivation at work. I saw napping at work as a logical solution. Today you can find MetroNaps EnergyPods at great companies like Google. That's me in a Pod.Support the Power 20 Method and I'll send you the guided meditation. This guide walks you through a 10-minute meditation that focuses on visualizing your day. You'll get this as part of most of the contributions. You'll also get the sleep aid. Sleep deprivation can seriously undermine any healthy regimen. That's why, with most contributions, you'll get the sleep aid sent to you as well.  It's a hypnotherapy track that's designed to quiet your mind so you can get to sleep.At the $39 level, we'll send you the entire kit. I'm relying on you to decide whether we bring this product to market. 
Our biggest challenge is the cost of the physical goods. We're using the campaign to bring down the cost of printing and redesigning our packaging so the kits can be safely shipped worldwide.
No matter how much is raised, we can fulfill every order right now, but with sub-optimal packaging.
You should get your Power 20 Method package within a month of the campaign's end.

<h1>More Resin Details</h1>
<p><b>Does the resin work on printers besides the Form1?</b></p>
<p>Yes, the resin will work in other printers, such as the 
B9, Muve3D, and others. However, we still need to settle on the 
appropriate print settings for other laser and projector based printers.
 We have developed other general-purpose resins that we have as a reward as well, which are more suited for most laser and DLP systems.</p>
<p><b>Is there a risk to my printer using your resin?</b></p>
<p>MadeSolid resin does not make contact with any functional parts of your 
printer other than the vat and the build platform. It is therefore highly unlikely that the resin will damage any other portion of your printer. During our testing, as well as the testing of beta users, there have been no adverse results from printing with MadeSolid resin. </p>
<p><b>Will it damage my vat?</b></p>
<p>There have been no adverse affects reported by any users 
of the resin damaging vats or build platforms. Our resin has a lower viscosity, so it is not as thick as resins you may be used to using. As a result, it is easier to clean, while creating less friction between your build 
platform and vat. However, all vats used in resin printing will need to be replaced according to the timeline provided to you by the printer manufacturer.</p>
<p><b>What colors are available?</b></p>
<p>Currently, Black, White, Blue, and Pink are available. We have printed in other colors, and those will be available soon. If you have a color that you would like to see, send an email to listening@madesolid.com. It's likely that we can make something happen if there is enough of a request. <br/></p>
<p><b>How do I choose a color for my resin?</b></p>
<p>You can select a different color for each liter you buy. For example, if you buy a pack of 3, you can choose 2 White Liters and 1 Blue Liter <b>or </b>1 Pink Lt.1 Black Lt. 1 White Lt. Just message us once you finish the checkout and let us know which combo of colors you want.<br/></p>
<p><b>What is the shelf life of the resin?</b></p>
<p>All resin has a shelf life. We estimate that your resin 
will be good as new for 6-months, after which the quality of the resin may start to diminish. Regardless of the amount of time it has been on 
the shelf, we suggest shaking the bottle of resin before use.</p>
<p><b>Do you have estimated delivery dates for the resin?
 
</b></p>
<p>We plan to ship 30 days from when the campaign finishes. Once
 we close the campaign it will take a little time to get the supplies, 
mix together the formula, and ship it.</p>

That is the core concept behind this project. But how will we accomplish this? Through a highly dynamic, educational, motivational and social website that does all the work for you so you can enjoy your health. Read on to get the details!<span class=""notranlsate"">
<h3 style=""color: #FF5500;"">Who Am I?</h3>
<p>Hello, my name is Eric Schmidt. I've had a serious love/hate relationship with exercise my entire adult life. I know how important it is, I know how much better I feel when I do it regularly, but I always get bored with it after a month or two and I stop.</p>
<p><strong>The stopping needs to stop.</strong></p>
<p>I started paying more attention to what my workout routine is like when I'm motivated and what is happening when my motivation stops. Then I talked to a number of friends and acquaintances and asked them the same questions I was asking myself.</p>
<p>Here's what I found to be the two key parts of a successful, long-term exercise 'program' for many people (including myself):</p>
<ul>
<li>Diversity</li>
<li>Motivation</li>
</ul>
<h3 style=""color: #FF5500;"">The Team</h3>
I found a group of amazingly talented individuals with varied, yet applicable, backgrounds to ensure this project is a great success. <br/><h1 style=""color: #FF5500;"">What We Need &amp; What You Get</h1>
<p>There are four main sections to this project that need funding:</p>
<ul>
<li>The main website</li>
<li>The mobile website</li>
<li>The apps for mobile devices, including tablets</li>
<li>The professional, educational and motivating how-to videos</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, I'm sure you'd like to know what's so special about this website and why you should help in it's creation.</p>
<h2 style=""color: #FF5500;"">What is This Website and Why is it Special?</h2>
<p>This is so much more than your typical health and fitness website, I could write a book about everything that will go into it and how helpful it will be. But there's not that much room so here's a breakdown of the key points. And if you have any questions about specific sections of the website and what is planned, please don't hesitate to ask, we'll be more than happy to go into more detail.</p>
<p><b>In a Nutshell</b></p>
<p><b>This cross-platform system is <i>highly personalized</i>, providing each user programs based on their own specific needs, abilities and goals!</b><br/></p>
<p><strong>Auto-Creation Tool</strong></p>
<p>The website will have a very robust auto workout creation tool. This tool will build a workout for you based on your input, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your gear</li>
<li>Your fitness level</li>
<li>Body parts you want to focus on</li>
<li>Workout style, such as plyometrics, bulking up, endurance, yoga, etc...</li>
</ul>
<p>This workout creation tool will adjust the intensity of workouts and individual exercises it gives you based on the input you gave from previous workouts. This tool will be extremely powerful and highly dynamic, this leads to solving the first problem I listed above, 'diversity'. Not only will this tool give you a workout for the day, but it can also create long-term programs that include rest days/weeks, increases in difficulty, etc...</p>
<p>You will never have to think about what workout to do, nor will you get bored as workouts won't repeat, each and every workout will be unique, unless you don't want them to be, it's entirely up to you.</p>
<p>This creation tool is very powerful and like nothing out there.</p>
<p><strong>Education</strong></p>
<p>There will be hundreds of individual exercises in the database. Because of this, odds are at some point, you will find yourself needing to do exercises you've never seen before or are not too familiar with. This means there needs to be a robust education section on the site.</p>
<p>The education section will contain a wide variety of information, including 100's of step-by-step videos on how to do the exercises on the site. These videos will be professionally made and taught by highly-trained individuals so they'll be fun to watch and trustworthy.</p>
<p><strong>User Profile</strong></p>
<p>The profile section will contain everything about you that you want to put into the system and the ability to share or not share various parts of it with the community.</p>
<p>This is also where you can track of everything related to your exercise routines, or as much or as little as you want. You can track your physical traits, such as weight, blood pressure, etc... and you can track all workouts you've completed, weight/reps/sets/etc... you did for them, and you'll be able to create graphs with your entire history or just parts of it.<br/></p>
<p><strong>The Social Platform</strong></p>
<p>Here, you will be able to engage with others to help solve the second problem listed above, 'motivation'.</p>
<p>Motivation is a huge problem for many people and finding people to work with towards similar goals or who like similar workouts can really help.</p>
<p>Not only will you be able to find others but you'll be able to build workouts and whole programs and share them with the community and the world. Maybe you create a fantastic workout program specifically designed for Spartan Races, you'll be able to build it and share it, even create and share your own workout videos.</p>
<p><strong>Corners</strong></p>
<p>There will be different sections of the website dedicated to different styles of exercise, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Yoga</li>
<li>Dynamic workouts similar to the styles of Crossfit and P90X</li>
<li>Endurance running</li>
<li>Power lifting</li>
<li>And more!<br/>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Each style will have it's own area on the site where people can connect with others, create workout routines to keep or share, have workout routines created by the system specifically for them, share their success and much, much more.</p>
<h2 style=""color: #FF5500;"">Costs</h2>
<p>Here is the funding needed to be sure we can pay for each of the sections:</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/8335/files/20130812153258-Project-Costs.jpg?1376346778"" src="""" style=""""/></p>The cost breakdown above will cover everything critical to this project. However, it's important to note that $20,000 probably won't allow us to make all the videos we want, nor will $25,000 let us deploy apps on all the mobile systems we'd like to, at least right away (we will still develop them eventually, however). All money above and beyond our goal will help improve the scope of the initial deployment and add more important educational videos.<br/><br/><p>What if, knock on wood, we don't reach our goal? Although this would certainly be terrible, we'll still be able to get either the website or the apps built, plus get started on the videos. Then we would work on financing the other aspect(s) of the project.</p>
<h1 style=""color: #FF5500;"">So, What do You Get for Contributing?</h1>
<p>We came up with some fun and useful perks at a wide variety of donation levels.</p>
<p><b>For the individual</b></p>
<p>In addition to producer credit on some of our videos, the perks range from a magnet to gym gear such as a jacket or gym bag. All the products will have our awesome logo (still in development) and the statement that you're a 'Founding Partner'! Once the funding process is complete, no more 'Founding Partner' logos will be made.<br/></p>
<p><b>For the business</b></p>
<p>If you're a business and would like to get some amazing niche-specific, health and fitness-related advertising, contributing to this project is a great way to do it. Not only will you get advertising credit on some of our videos via annotations (the higher the contribution, the more videos your business name will appear in), but you'll get targeted advertising credits on the website (again, the higher the contribution, the more credits). The advertising is CPM-based, i.e. pay-per-view, which means the more you donate, the more eye-balls you get your business in front of.</p>
<p>We have a solid marketing plan to get users to the site to make it grow quickly and rapidly, the more money we bring in, the more marketing strategies we can apply and the faster we can grow. We have great plans and very high expectations for this program. Feel free to contact us if you'd like some more information before donating.<br/></p>
<p><b>Important Note: </b>Advertising for adult and adult-related products, services and sites will not be accepted, nor will advertising for any site, product or service that promotes illegal activities. Please use common sense, if you're unsure whether or not you'll be allowed to advertise on the site, odds are you won't be.</p>
<p style=""color: #FF5500;""><b>Important Producer Credit Note:</b></p>
<p>We will place no more than 2 credits total per video, near the beginning of the video. If you have a specific video or style of video you want your credit placed in, we will be happy to accommodate. Because of the nature of advertising in the videos, we will place the credit in an annotation. You can see annotations in use on YouTube videos. They are the blocks of text or links that appear somewhere on the screen during a video (they are not the ads that slide up from the bottom of the video). Since embedded items in videos can't be changed once a video is uploaded, we will use annotations so we can make changes as needed.<br/></p>
<p>Please don't hesitate to contact us if you have any questions about the perks.</p>
<h1 style=""color: #FF5500;"">Referral Contest</h1>

That is the core concept behind this project. But how will we accomplish this? Through a highly dynamic, educational, motivational and social website that does all the work for you so you can enjoy your health. Read on to get the details!
Who Am I?
Hello, my name is Eric Schmidt. I've had a serious love/hate relationship with exercise my entire adult life. I know how important it is, I know how much better I feel when I do it regularly, but I always get bored with it after a month or two and I stop.
The stopping needs to stop.
I started paying more attention to what my workout routine is like when I'm motivated and what is happening when my motivation stops. Then I talked to a number of friends and acquaintances and asked them the same questions I was asking myself.
Here's what I found to be the two key parts of a successful, long-term exercise 'program' for many people (including myself):

Diversity
Motivation

The Team
I found a group of amazingly talented individuals with varied, yet applicable, backgrounds to ensure this project is a great success. What We Need & What You Get
There are four main sections to this project that need funding:

The main website
The mobile website
The apps for mobile devices, including tablets
The professional, educational and motivating how-to videos

Now, I'm sure you'd like to know what's so special about this website and why you should help in it's creation.
What is This Website and Why is it Special?
This is so much more than your typical health and fitness website, I could write a book about everything that will go into it and how helpful it will be. But there's not that much room so here's a breakdown of the key points. And if you have any questions about specific sections of the website and what is planned, please don't hesitate to ask, we'll be more than happy to go into more detail.
In a Nutshell
This cross-platform system is highly personalized, providing each user programs based on their own specific needs, abilities and goals!
Auto-Creation Tool
The website will have a very robust auto workout creation tool. This tool will build a workout for you based on your input, including:

Your gear
Your fitness level
Body parts you want to focus on
Workout style, such as plyometrics, bulking up, endurance, yoga, etc...

This workout creation tool will adjust the intensity of workouts and individual exercises it gives you based on the input you gave from previous workouts. This tool will be extremely powerful and highly dynamic, this leads to solving the first problem I listed above, 'diversity'. Not only will this tool give you a workout for the day, but it can also create long-term programs that include rest days/weeks, increases in difficulty, etc...
You will never have to think about what workout to do, nor will you get bored as workouts won't repeat, each and every workout will be unique, unless you don't want them to be, it's entirely up to you.
This creation tool is very powerful and like nothing out there.
Education
There will be hundreds of individual exercises in the database. Because of this, odds are at some point, you will find yourself needing to do exercises you've never seen before or are not too familiar with. This means there needs to be a robust education section on the site.
The education section will contain a wide variety of information, including 100's of step-by-step videos on how to do the exercises on the site. These videos will be professionally made and taught by highly-trained individuals so they'll be fun to watch and trustworthy.
User Profile
The profile section will contain everything about you that you want to put into the system and the ability to share or not share various parts of it with the community.
This is also where you can track of everything related to your exercise routines, or as much or as little as you want. You can track your physical traits, such as weight, blood pressure, etc... and you can track all workouts you've completed, weight/reps/sets/etc... you did for them, and you'll be able to create graphs with your entire history or just parts of it.
The Social Platform
Here, you will be able to engage with others to help solve the second problem listed above, 'motivation'.
Motivation is a huge problem for many people and finding people to work with towards similar goals or who like similar workouts can really help.
Not only will you be able to find others but you'll be able to build workouts and whole programs and share them with the community and the world. Maybe you create a fantastic workout program specifically designed for Spartan Races, you'll be able to build it and share it, even create and share your own workout videos.
Corners
There will be different sections of the website dedicated to different styles of exercise, such as:

Yoga
Dynamic workouts similar to the styles of Crossfit and P90X
Endurance running
Power lifting
And more!


Each style will have it's own area on the site where people can connect with others, create workout routines to keep or share, have workout routines created by the system specifically for them, share their success and much, much more.
Costs
Here is the funding needed to be sure we can pay for each of the sections:
The cost breakdown above will cover everything critical to this project. However, it's important to note that $20,000 probably won't allow us to make all the videos we want, nor will $25,000 let us deploy apps on all the mobile systems we'd like to, at least right away (we will still develop them eventually, however). All money above and beyond our goal will help improve the scope of the initial deployment and add more important educational videos.What if, knock on wood, we don't reach our goal? Although this would certainly be terrible, we'll still be able to get either the website or the apps built, plus get started on the videos. Then we would work on financing the other aspect(s) of the project.
So, What do You Get for Contributing?
We came up with some fun and useful perks at a wide variety of donation levels.
For the individual
In addition to producer credit on some of our videos, the perks range from a magnet to gym gear such as a jacket or gym bag. All the products will have our awesome logo (still in development) and the statement that you're a 'Founding Partner'! Once the funding process is complete, no more 'Founding Partner' logos will be made.
For the business
If you're a business and would like to get some amazing niche-specific, health and fitness-related advertising, contributing to this project is a great way to do it. Not only will you get advertising credit on some of our videos via annotations (the higher the contribution, the more videos your business name will appear in), but you'll get targeted advertising credits on the website (again, the higher the contribution, the more credits). The advertising is CPM-based, i.e. pay-per-view, which means the more you donate, the more eye-balls you get your business in front of.
We have a solid marketing plan to get users to the site to make it grow quickly and rapidly, the more money we bring in, the more marketing strategies we can apply and the faster we can grow. We have great plans and very high expectations for this program. Feel free to contact us if you'd like some more information before donating.
Important Note: Advertising for adult and adult-related products, services and sites will not be accepted, nor will advertising for any site, product or service that promotes illegal activities. Please use common sense, if you're unsure whether or not you'll be allowed to advertise on the site, odds are you won't be.
Important Producer Credit Note:
We will place no more than 2 credits total per video, near the beginning of the video. If you have a specific video or style of video you want your credit placed in, we will be happy to accommodate. Because of the nature of advertising in the videos, we will place the credit in an annotation. You can see annotations in use on YouTube videos. They are the blocks of text or links that appear somewhere on the screen during a video (they are not the ads that slide up from the bottom of the video). Since embedded items in videos can't be changed once a video is uploaded, we will use annotations so we can make changes as needed.
Please don't hesitate to contact us if you have any questions about the perks.
Referral Contest
We decided to add a referral contest, it's easy to take part and the more money raised by your referrals, the better loot you get!

There are two ways to take part:
Sign in to Indiegogo (create an account if you don't have one already) then use the 'Share' links on our campaign page just below the intro video. If you look at the links that are created, there is a number at the end, the link with look something like https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/495191/emal/3552162 where '3552162' will be replaced with a number unique to you.
After making a contribution, you'll get a share link like the one above that is unique to you. Simply share it on Facebook, Twitter, in an email, or anywhere you want.
We'll be able to use these unique links to determine any referrals you make!
Other Ways You Can Help
We know not everybody can contribute to the project and that's quite alright. The real key to our success will be getting the word out, so please, whether you contribute or not, share this campaign with your friends, family and the world. You will be helping get a fantastic service out to the world.
Thank you very much for your consideration and time, it is extremely appreciated.

<h2>A Conversation with America</h2>
<p>On August 24th I depart Palisades Beach State Park in Los Angeles to walk 8873 miles around the United States. I do this to challenge the discrimination against obese people and to empower myself and others to lose weight.</p>
<p>Last year 300,000 people died from obesity, even if the official death reason is not ""obesity"", there are many ways to die from being too big. Maybe one of the people who died was one of your loved ones, or maybe you struggle with your own weight. One thing is for sure, you know people, who like me, have struggled their entire lives with obesity, and it can be debilitating. <br/>I am one of those people whose health is negatively impacted by obesity, and this walk is my own empowerment as well as an effort to help others.</p>
<p>Obesity was recently declared an official illness, and evidence shows it is a complex condition.</p>
<p>$800 covers one month expenses for me while on the road. Briefly, the expenses are: Telephone, Health Insurance, Food and Camping fee's. Gear, clothes and shoes is additional, although for now, I have that covered.</p>
<p>Once I have raised my budget for the walk I will start to fund raise for obesity related charities.</p>
<p>I have sold my belongings as a way to fund the first 1 or 2 months of walk, after that I will rely on your contributions. I will continue to walk as long as I have funds, if I run out then I will either stop and work for a brief time or go home.</p>
<p>This walk will be an exciting adventure - and not just for me. You are welcome to join me for any part of the walk, hook up in with me in cities and towns across the country, join me on facebook or even host me for a night.</p>
<p>You can choose to get involved at any level you want. Whether spreading the word about my amazing walk, joining my on facebook or supporting my campaign with donations.</p>

<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1174773/files/20150126083009-tuekey_baster.jpg?1422289809"" src="""" style=""width: 206px; height: 206px;""/><b>THE DREADED TURKEY BASTER!</b><br/></p>
In their first attempt to conceive at home with a turkey baster, they quickly realized just how awful this ""experience"" was and that's when Stephanie became motivated to create something better for them.   After lots of brainstorming, prototyping and engineering, Stephanie had created The Semenette®.  The Semenette® is a unique, high quality ejaculating dildo that allows people to have intercourse and mimic an ejaculation.  From a functional standpoint, The Semenette® can also help: <br/><ul>
<li>Men with Erectile Dysfunction</li>
<li>Men with Disabilities</li>
<li>Transgender (FTM) Community<br/>
</li>
</ul>The best part of this new invention?  Because of The Semenette®, Stephanie and her wife were able to successfully conceive their daughter, Isabella.  You remember that hair club for men commercial from the 80's?  Well, Stephanie is also proud to say, ""I'm not only the President, I'm also a client!"" <br/><br/><p style="""">Once The Semenette® was on the market, there were so many people the toy was helping not only from a
 functional perspective but from a pleasure perspective as well and we knew we were really onto something.  Some of the communities that also support and endorse The Semenette® are:</p>
<ul>
<li>BDSM/Kink - (Think 50 Shades of Gray!)<br/>
</li>
<li>Pegging</li>
<li>Swingers</li>
<li>Adult Performers<br/>
</li>
<li>Single Women</li>
<li>Heterosexual Couples</li>
<li>Gay Men<br/>
</li>
</ul>
<p><b>                                             WHY WE NEED YOU!</b><br/>
</p>
<p>This campaign is so important to us because we REALLY want to continue 
to provide you with the highest quality in pleasure toys possible.  Your
 contribution will allow us to make The 
Semenette® V2, so we can continue to meet the needs of each of our 
customers.  It's not easy being a start up business, let alone being a 
business woman in a heavily male dominated industry.  Your contribution 
empowers women, entrepreneurs and not only that, it helps us continue to
 spread sex positivity, love, fun and pleasure to EVERYONE around the 
world. 
</p>
<p> As an innovator seeking to improve couples' sex lives from a functional AND fun standpoint, Stephanie and her team are always striving to provide customers with consistent improvements and options to meet their needs.  The desires of customers are always evolving and with your help we want to evolve our toys with them and bring you The Semenette V2! </p>

 and use a softer silicone to enhance the comfort and feel of the 
toy.  <br/><br/><p><b>            WHAT WILL YOUR CONTRIBUTIONS WILL BE USED FOR?</b><br/>We know everyone's money is valuable.  We want you to feel

doing with the funds raised: <br/></p>
<p>Molds, tooling and custom parts aren't
 cheap!  Ever heard of modular rack tooling?  We hadn't either until we 
invented The Semenette®!  $35K of the money raised from this campaign 
will go directly to manufacturing costs of V2, this includes prototypes and inventory.  Your contribution will help us make The Semenette in new colors and new sizes.  Additionally, we have decided to lower our campaign goal and will work on raising the 15K for new packaging for The Semenette® V2 to 
accommodate for the new toy at a later time!  Despite us wanting to look good, what is most important to us is making the new toy at the highest quality possible!<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> </span></p>

THE DREADED TURKEY BASTER!
In their first attempt to conceive at home with a turkey baster, they quickly realized just how awful this ""experience"" was and that's when Stephanie became motivated to create something better for them.   After lots of brainstorming, prototyping and engineering, Stephanie had created The Semenette®.  The Semenette® is a unique, high quality ejaculating dildo that allows people to have intercourse and mimic an ejaculation.  From a functional standpoint, The Semenette® can also help: 
Men with Erectile Dysfunction
Men with Disabilities
Transgender (FTM) Community

The best part of this new invention?  Because of The Semenette®, Stephanie and her wife were able to successfully conceive their daughter, Isabella.  You remember that hair club for men commercial from the 80's?  Well, Stephanie is also proud to say, ""I'm not only the President, I'm also a client!"" Once The Semenette® was on the market, there were so many people the toy was helping not only from a
 functional perspective but from a pleasure perspective as well and we knew we were really onto something.  Some of the communities that also support and endorse The Semenette® are:

BDSM/Kink - (Think 50 Shades of Gray!)

Pegging
Swingers
Adult Performers

Single Women
Heterosexual Couples
Gay Men


                                             WHY WE NEED YOU!

This campaign is so important to us because we REALLY want to continue 
to provide you with the highest quality in pleasure toys possible.  Your
 contribution will allow us to make The 
Semenette® V2, so we can continue to meet the needs of each of our 
customers.  It's not easy being a start up business, let alone being a 
business woman in a heavily male dominated industry.  Your contribution 
empowers women, entrepreneurs and not only that, it helps us continue to
 spread sex positivity, love, fun and pleasure to EVERYONE around the 
world. 

 As an innovator seeking to improve couples' sex lives from a functional AND fun standpoint, Stephanie and her team are always striving to provide customers with consistent improvements and options to meet their needs.  The desires of customers are always evolving and with your help we want to evolve our toys with them and bring you The Semenette V2! 

Here's what we currently haveUp to this point, we manufactured 500 units in 3 realistic colors, Vanilla, Cinnamon and Chocolate.  With your contribution, we will manufacture The 
Semenette® V2 in NEW non-realistic color options (tell us what color you want to see!), make 
different sizes of the toy, larger bulbs for squirting even more liquid,
 and use a softer silicone to enhance the comfort and feel of the 
toy.              WHAT WILL YOUR CONTRIBUTIONS WILL BE USED FOR?We know everyone's money is valuable.  We want you to feel
 comfortable supporting us and our campaign.  Here's what we plan on 
doing with the funds raised: 
Molds, tooling and custom parts aren't
 cheap!  Ever heard of modular rack tooling?  We hadn't either until we 
invented The Semenette®!  $35K of the money raised from this campaign 
will go directly to manufacturing costs of V2, this includes prototypes and inventory.  Your contribution will help us make The Semenette in new colors and new sizes.  Additionally, we have decided to lower our campaign goal and will work on raising the 15K for new packaging for The Semenette® V2 to 
accommodate for the new toy at a later time!  Despite us wanting to look good, what is most important to us is making the new toy at the highest quality possible! 

Here's a sneak peak at our new packaging!With this funding we
will produce V2 of The Semenette® and we will be able to continue to finalize a major distribution deal with  El Dorado, one of the leading adult sex toy distributors in the industry!  Please give us your feedback on which color and/or size 
Semenette® you want to see next!  The options we are deciding between are 
Black, Blue, Purple and Pink.  We value your opinion so let us know!

<h3>Who are we?<br/>
</h3>
<p>We're a group of friends, scattered all over the world, who are unable to offer a dear friend of ours a couch and a shoulder to cry on in her time of need. We're all broke students, and most of us are oceans away - so we're turning to you! good people of the internet, to help Daphne out.</p>
<p><b>Why does she need help?</b><br/><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""><br/>Daphne is a wonderful, talented twenty three year old who lives in Greece, with her adorable giant kitten Kida. Until now, she's been living in a small apartment and attending university but due to years of abuse by her family, she has been diagnosed with depression and is unable to continue her studies without aid. </span><br/></p>
<p>She can not afford to see any mental health professionals, though she desperately needs help. </p>
<p>Right on the heels of this, her family has been pushing her to move in with them, which will be devastating for her mental health, and as such are refusing to help her keep her apartment while she searches for work. We have created this campaign in order to help support Daphne while she finds work in a destitute economy, and so that she can start receiving much needed treatment as soon as possible.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We've worked out the general cost of living in Greece, paying her bills and rent, buying food and feeding her cat at a minimum of 400-500euro a month. We're hoping to make enough to keep her apartment paid for for a few months, and hopefully have enough left over to see a local therapist or counselor. </p>
<p>Your money will go directly to this - paying rent, utility bills, food costs, travel expenses and for medical help. All of this will help Daphne be in a better position to find work and apply for jobs, without the looming threat of losing her apartment or having her electricity shut off. <br/><br/>We've got some great perks for those who donate! </p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>
<span style=""letter-spacing: 0.06em;"">Other Ways You Can Help</span><br/>

<p>The economy right now is tough for everyone, so if you can't donate you can help immensely by spreading the word! Indiegogo provides several easy ways of sharing online.

We're a group of friends, scattered all over the world, who are unable to offer a dear friend of ours a couch and a shoulder to cry on in her time of need. We're all broke students, and most of us are oceans away - so we're turning to you! good people of the internet, to help Daphne out.
Why does she need help?Daphne is a wonderful, talented twenty three year old who lives in Greece, with her adorable giant kitten Kida. Until now, she's been living in a small apartment and attending university but due to years of abuse by her family, she has been diagnosed with depression and is unable to continue her studies without aid. 
She can not afford to see any mental health professionals, though she desperately needs help. 
Right on the heels of this, her family has been pushing her to move in with them, which will be devastating for her mental health, and as such are refusing to help her keep her apartment while she searches for work. We have created this campaign in order to help support Daphne while she finds work in a destitute economy, and so that she can start receiving much needed treatment as soon as possible.


What We Need & What You Get
We've worked out the general cost of living in Greece, paying her bills and rent, buying food and feeding her cat at a minimum of 400-500euro a month. We're hoping to make enough to keep her apartment paid for for a few months, and hopefully have enough left over to see a local therapist or counselor. 
Your money will go directly to this - paying rent, utility bills, food costs, travel expenses and for medical help. All of this will help Daphne be in a better position to find work and apply for jobs, without the looming threat of losing her apartment or having her electricity shut off. We've got some great perks for those who donate! 



Other Ways You Can Help

The economy right now is tough for everyone, so if you can't donate you can help immensely by spreading the word! Indiegogo provides several easy ways of sharing online. There's a tumblr post with these details HERE, and if you're active on that site, please reblog!

<p>WHAT HAPPENED</p>
<p>In April, 2015, Grove Instruments, Inc. of Worcester,
Massachusetts, suddenly went bankrupt for reasons that remain unclear to this day. Grove was developing a non-invasive blood
glucose monitor based on a near-infrared through-the-earlobe optical technique
called the optical bridge. Almost 20 people lost their jobs, but that is not
the worst: for decades, diabetes-sufferers have been pricking their fingers to
get a blood sample for blood glucose measurement, and now the leading hope, and
any hope, to get rid of those fingerpricks is suddenly in grave danger. </p>
<p>THE TECHNOLOGY</p>
<p>The technology has passed scientific scrutiny ten times, as
it has gained ten SBIR (Small Business Innovative Research) grants from the
NIH. Extensive clinical testing has been done over many years on over 300 diabetic
persons, and the results were the best ever just before the bankruptcy. Here, I can only tell about things that have been made public in the patents. There are many facets to the technology, here is one: - Measuring blood glucose directly by absorption is impossible, and increasing the resolution of the Analog/Digital converter does not help. However, if the rate of change of the signal is used as the signal instead of the signal itself, the resulting superresolution makes it possible to measure blood glucose when the blood content of the tissue is modulated.</p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1450751201/cotvblyun5bm3n84me8r.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p>I WAS THERE</p><div>
<p>I, Hannu Harjunmaa, PhD, was one of the two founders of

<br/>
<p>NEW START</p>
<p>I founded Valoa Technologies, Inc. in June, 2015, to
commercialize my new inventions not involving blood glucose measurement. However, if
Valoa is able to acquire the patents from the Grove estate, it will continue
the development of the non-invasive blood glucose monitor. If someone else
acquires the patents, there is no guarantee that the work will continue.</p>
<p>ARE WE ALONE?</p>
<p>Grove Instruments was not the only company developing a
non-invasive blood glucose monitor. We are aware of companies in Israel and the
UK and elsewhere having active development projects using different
technologies. But, during the last 25 years that I have been in this business, numerous
competitors have appeared and disappeared. Yet, someone will make it someday. </p>
<p>WHAT HAPPENS NEXT</p>
<p>The Trustee of the bankruptcy estate has ordered an auction
to be held on January 27, 2016. The assets to be sold are, most importantly,
the IP, or the US
and international patents. It is impossible to predict the amount of the winning
bid. That is the reason this campaign is a Flexible Funding campaign. Valoa
Technologies will go to the auction with whatever funds are raised in this
campaign, plus a buffer whose size, for obvious reasons, cannot be disclosed
here.</p>
<p>WHAT WE ARE TRYING TO DO</p>
<p>The goal of this campaign is to raise enough money to win
the auction. Commercialization of a blood glucose monitor is NOT the immediate goal,
although, if the campaign is a huge success, it might become possible, too.
Only by acquiring the patents can we keep alive the dream of a non-invasive
blood glucose monitor. There are many players in the field of blood glucose
testing who will be severely hurt by the introduction of a non-invasive device.
The companies that make test strips make billions of dollars each year on them
(Global Data estimates the strip market size to be $10.9B in 2017). It is
conceivable that a large company could participate in the auction, directly or
indirectly, only to acquire and then shelve the patents.</p>
<p>WHAT IF WE ARE SUCCESSFUL</p>
<p>If we are hugely successful, the product development may
continue immediately. It is more probable, though, that not enough funds are
raised to both win the auction and continue development. If that happens,
additional funding will be sought.</p>
<p>The world has at least 360 million diagnosed diabetics (and many more
undiagnosed). If one percent of them donate to this project an average of $10,
the money raised is $36M. That is enough to bring the non-invasive blood
glucose monitor to market. </p>
<p><b>DIABETES SUFFERERS OF THE WORLD: YOU WANT IT – YOU MAY
NOW HAVE IT!  WITH ENOUGH SUPPORT, THIS PROJECT MAY GROW FROM A RESCUE MISSION TO A LIFE-CHANGER FOR ALL THOSE WHO NOW HAVE TO PRICK THEIR FINGERS.</b></p>
<p>WHAT IF WE ARE NOT SUCCESSFUL</p>
<p>Valoa Technologies has under development a device useful for
persons with diabetes. It is a hand-held device that can be used to measure the
sugar content of beverages, such as wines, in unopened glass bottles. If Valoa does not win the
auction, the funds raised in this campaign will be used to commercialize this
product, the Valoa Brix:</p>

<p>RISKS AND CHALLENGES</p>
<p>Challenge #1 is the auction itself. There is no way to
predict how high a bid is needed to win it. It could be small, like $10k, if
nobody else is interested. If a big company is interested, it may drive the bid
to millions of dollars. All we can say now is that more funds is better.</p>
<p>Beyond the auction, challenge #2 is the development of the
device itself. Although its results are very promising, there is no guarantee
that it will get FDA approval. Another risk is that someone else gets to the
market first with a clearly superior product.</p>

<h3>Why We're Running</h3>
<p>In June, 2007 Pomona College graduate and former Pomona-Pitzer tennis player Erin Noble died tragically in a plane crash. Erin was an ebulliant and passionate teammate, friend, and member of our family who lived each day with vigor and appreciation for his opportunities. While each day without Erin is a tragedy, we are committed to challenging ourselves, reaching outside of our comfort zones, and seeking to become better people with each new day. Each fall, our team spends one Saturday morning conditioning on the beach off of Manhattan Beach Pier. This year, it seemed a fitting tribute to run in the Manhattan Beach 10k, as Erin loved running. Everyone will be wearing this year's team shirts that say, ""Be Noble"" reminding us to live life for the moment.</p>

<h2><strong>Thank you for showing your support and stopping by my Campaign.</strong></h2>
<p>     The long term goal is to start a foundation to raise money towards finding a cure for Multiple Sclerosis.</p>
<p>     To do this, my plan is to have several fundraising events a year i.e... BBQ Cook-off, Casino Nights, Musical events, with all proceeds used to benefit the fight for a cure of Multiple Sclerosis.</p>
<p>     The first event is going to be called 'DerekEbikes4Us'. The scope of this event consists of my (Derek Evans, a Multiple Sclerosis patient) riding an electric bike approximately 4200 miles across country from Key West to Seattle beginning February 2013. I plan to film interviews with all of the people I meet along the way and post it on the web site, have a daily video blog and just raise as much awareness about the cause as possible.   </p>
<p>      This campaign is designed to obtain the funding to get the first fundraising event off the ground. I intend to attract people that feel as strongly about finding a cure for Multiple Sclerosis and spreading awareness as I do and ask them to donate and be a large part of this dream.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>These are the items that are still needed to start the fundraising for the DerekEbikes4Us event.</p>
<ul>
<li>Web Site construction</li>
<li>Web Site Hosting</li>
<li>Dedicated phone line</li>
<li>P.O. Box</li>
<li>A 501c3 attorney, (tax deductible status).</li>
</ul><p>      The plan is to get started with everything the day the funds become available. The web site will be up within thirty days, which is also about as long as it will take for the attorney to attain the 501c3. The P.O.

<p>“Let food be the medicine and let medicine be the food.” - Hippocrates (father of medicine), 400 BC.</p>
<p>We all rely on our knowledge (or craving) to make the decisions on what we put in our mouth, and ultimately our decisions shape our body, mind and moods. There are many health problems that are directly related to the food we eat.</p>
<p>When we think of food, what come to our mind? Burger, Fries, Soda? Well we can’t blame ourselves. We are born in the world of fast food. Our choices of food are dictated by TV commercials.</p>
<p><img alt=""Banner"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/i5gjq7eix2x39qa/B2.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Researches shows that many specific foods can serve as powerful natural drugs like cancer fighting, cholesterol reducers, antibiotics, antidepressants, energy boosters, antioxidant, blood pressure lowering, and the list goes on. Food can thus be used as a miracle medicine to prevent and treat many diseases.</p>
<p>I always wondered why this is not taught in our schools. This would be a wonderful knowledge we can give to our kids. As a parent, I always wondered how to make my kids run to eat the fruits or salads on the table as they would run to the sound of the door bell of the Pizza delivery. This book strives at making the art of enjoying fruits and veggies in our everyday life.</p>
<p><img alt=""Persimmons"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/wzouuksb1izxu83/Persimmons.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Most important asset we all have is our health, and yet we hardly know what our body needs to stay healthy, to fight diseases and to prevent failure of our organs. What we need is an owner’s manual for our body.</p>
<p>Due to my personal quest, I gathered lot of information about specific benefits of the natural foods by going through many books, research journals and health articles. Lot of this information can help us in taking care of our illness, keeping our body and mind healthy. This project is all about presenting the major benefits of the natural foods in a very simple format, which we and our kids will take interest to learn and adopt healthy eating habits.</p>

“Let food be the medicine and let medicine be the food.” - Hippocrates (father of medicine), 400 BC.
We all rely on our knowledge (or craving) to make the decisions on what we put in our mouth, and ultimately our decisions shape our body, mind and moods. There are many health problems that are directly related to the food we eat.
When we think of food, what come to our mind? Burger, Fries, Soda? Well we can’t blame ourselves. We are born in the world of fast food. Our choices of food are dictated by TV commercials.

Researches shows that many specific foods can serve as powerful natural drugs like cancer fighting, cholesterol reducers, antibiotics, antidepressants, energy boosters, antioxidant, blood pressure lowering, and the list goes on. Food can thus be used as a miracle medicine to prevent and treat many diseases.
I always wondered why this is not taught in our schools. This would be a wonderful knowledge we can give to our kids. As a parent, I always wondered how to make my kids run to eat the fruits or salads on the table as they would run to the sound of the door bell of the Pizza delivery. This book strives at making the art of enjoying fruits and veggies in our everyday life.

Most important asset we all have is our health, and yet we hardly know what our body needs to stay healthy, to fight diseases and to prevent failure of our organs. What we need is an owner’s manual for our body.
Due to my personal quest, I gathered lot of information about specific benefits of the natural foods by going through many books, research journals and health articles. Lot of this information can help us in taking care of our illness, keeping our body and mind healthy. This project is all about presenting the major benefits of the natural foods in a very simple format, which we and our kids will take interest to learn and adopt healthy eating habits.

<h3>Doggies Helping Veterans</h3>
<p></p>Doggies Helping Veterans is a group of volunteers (and their dogs), led by Emmie the Superdog and her fiancé Snick the Dog, raising money to support Active Heroes in their effort to build and begin operating the Active Heroes Retreat. Emmie is the spokesdog for Active Heroes, and Snickers is a registered therapy dog with Pet Partners International (formerly Delta Society). Doggies Helping Veterans hopes to raise $100,000 of the total $1,000,000 needed for Phase One. The money raised will be used specifically for a dog park and trails and, eventually, to start a pet therapy program.<br/><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""><br/></span><p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Emmie and Snickers wanted to do something special to help fund the pet related programs at the Active Heroes Retreat. They thought that a doggie-only cross-country journey would be a unique and fun way to raise awareness and funds. Of course, dogs can't travel the country alone, so they convinced Snick's mom to coordinate a relay-type trip for some <b>stuffed Shiba stand-ins</b>.</p>

<h3>The Active Heroes Retreat</h3>
<p>Active Heroes is building a peaceful and tranquil retreat where military families will engage in team building activities and challenge courses. The Active Heroes Retreat will change the quality of life for veterans in many ways. Active Heroes will soon select the land and begin construction of an office, classrooms, sectioned camping sites and log cabins to house the families. Each month, the land will be used to give other military organizations a fun filled adventure getaway while allowing veterans to camp for free. Active Heroes will then work with therapists and social workers to organize classroom sessions to help curb the suicide rate of 22 veterans a day.<br/></p>

<p>Asante is a group of dedicated students that wish to further Bonyo’s Kenya Mission through service at the Mama Pilista Memorial Clinic in the village of Masara, Kenya. Our team of six will enthusiastically be serving the villagers through medicine, dentistry, pharmacy and public health back grounds. We will be traveling to Masara to serve for seven weeks. We will work while we are there to have the biggest impact that we can to improve the total welfare of the villagers. Our team of six all come from the philosophy that medical care is a human right, not a privilege. Many Kenyans will go their entire lives without ever seeing a physician and we wish to make sure all of those in Masara receive first class medical care. </p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://sphotos-a.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-frc3/379831_2744330574979_723248359_n.jpg"" src="""" style=""vertical-align: middle;""/></p>

<h2 dir=""ltr""><span>What We Will Do With Funds</span></h2>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>The purpose of this Indiegogo campaign is to bring in funds for our transportation to Ahero. The most expensive portion of this trip will be getting the six of us to Kenya. As of 3/5/2013 ticket prices broke down as such:</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Pittsburgh to Kisumu $1763 X 6 = <strong>$10,578</strong></span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><strong>Three tickets have been purchased.</strong></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Three tickets remain - our remaining need is <strong>$5,289</strong></span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span><strong>We have made this a short campaign because we want to avoid the rising cost of airline tickets the longer we wait to purchase them. </strong></span></p>
<p><strong id=""internal-source-marker_0.7431681489106268""><br/></strong>We currently have three of the six plane tickets purchased! This is an awesome start but we still have a lot of work to do, and we need your help!!!! The longer it takes us to raise funds for plane tickets, the more it is going to cost us, meaning the less money we can give back to BKM later for pharmaceuticals. The faster we can bring in funds, the greater the good we can do!</p>

<p dir=""ltr""><span>When Dr. Bonyo was a boy his sister died of pneumonia. Most of us are lucky enough to recognize this as a curable disease. This inspired Dr. Bonyo’s vow to one day become a physician, return to his village of Masara, Kenya, and provide proper medical care. Dr. Bonyo not only accomplished his oath of ensuring a public health system, but he also improved the quality of life by guaranteeing every child receives vaccinations, education through high school, and he even helped the villagers learn how to farm poultry.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>BKM serves a part of Kenya that is ravaged by HIV, TB, malaria and other curable diseases. Greater than 30% of the population is affected by HIV, making these patients even more susceptible to infection. Treatments that we have readily available are unfortunately not so easily attained for most of the villagers in Masara.  BKM works hard to try to provide the best possible care to those affected by HIV, and gain access to modern treatments for them. HIV was once designated as a disease of “undesirables”. This stigma is the furthest from the truth; many believe that HIV only affects homosexuals and injection-drug users, but the truth is, HIV affects more women than men in sub-Saharan Africa, and Kenya has no significant IV-drug problem. HIV in Kenya is spread primarily through heterosexual couples and by mother to child transmission.  77% of new infections are between heterosexual couples and 20,000 infants are born with HIV infection in Kenya every year. Without AZT medication mothers with HIV will pass the infection to their children, propagating another generation of victims. Education is not enough. </span><span>Proper medications must be available. Within the past month, BKM has secured government allotment of HIV medications to serve those scourged with HIV in Masara. </span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>The leading killer in Masara, Kenya continues to be malaria. Malaria is a treatable infection that is caused by a parasite that is transmitted by mosquito. DEET and other mosquito repellants are not readily available to those who are in Kenya. 25 million of 34 million Kenyans are at risk for malaria infection.  Malaria causes 20% of deaths among children in Kenya. BKM is working hard to provide mosquito nets to every family; however, the strain of malaria most common in Masara is a fairly resistant bug, requiring a stronger therapy of mefloquine, which is of course more expensive than previous treatment methods. Many other curable diseases take lives every day in Kenya. Through the Mama Pilista Memorial Clinic, BKM now has nurses and volunteer physicians living in the clinic 24/7.</span></p>
<p>The purpose of out seven week trip to Kenya is to provide world class care to the people of Masara through any means. Dr. Bonyo has been building BKM from the group up since 1996, and though a lot has been done a lot still remains to be finished. An investment in this mission is an investment in furthering BKM’s reach. BKM is not just dedicated to providing health care to Masara; it is dedicated to <em>passionately</em> improve the total welfare of every single villager.</p>

<p>Today take a step back and be thankful for all that you have. Every day millions of Kenyans go without a source of consistent food, clean water and medical care. Many Kenyans will go their entire life without ever seeing a physician. Bonyo's Kenya Mission seeks to bring an end to this one Kenyan at a time. Asante, is a group of dedicated individuals who will be traveling to Ahero, Kenya for two months working in the clinic and serving the community. Any monetary donations will go directly into funding our trip.<strong> Any funds raised above our goal will go to purchasing pharmaceuticals and medical supplies for The Clinic.</strong> Can’t give a monetary donation?

Asante is a group of dedicated students that wish to further Bonyo’s Kenya Mission through service at the Mama Pilista Memorial Clinic in the village of Masara, Kenya. Our team of six will enthusiastically be serving the villagers through medicine, dentistry, pharmacy and public health back grounds. We will be traveling to Masara to serve for seven weeks. We will work while we are there to have the biggest impact that we can to improve the total welfare of the villagers. Our team of six all come from the philosophy that medical care is a human right, not a privilege. Many Kenyans will go their entire lives without ever seeing a physician and we wish to make sure all of those in Masara receive first class medical care. 

Pictured above is one of our volunteers, William Wallace, and Dr. Bonyo during his first trip to The Clinic in 2011. 
What We Will Do With Funds
The purpose of this Indiegogo campaign is to bring in funds for our transportation to Ahero. The most expensive portion of this trip will be getting the six of us to Kenya. As of 3/5/2013 ticket prices broke down as such:
Pittsburgh to Kisumu $1763 X 6 = $10,578
Three tickets have been purchased.
Three tickets remain - our remaining need is $5,289
We have made this a short campaign because we want to avoid the rising cost of airline tickets the longer we wait to purchase them. 
We currently have three of the six plane tickets purchased! This is an awesome start but we still have a lot of work to do, and we need your help!!!! The longer it takes us to raise funds for plane tickets, the more it is going to cost us, meaning the less money we can give back to BKM later for pharmaceuticals. The faster we can bring in funds, the greater the good we can do!
 
Bonyo's Kenya Mission - 501(c)(3)


When Dr. Bonyo was a boy his sister died of pneumonia. Most of us are lucky enough to recognize this as a curable disease. This inspired Dr. Bonyo’s vow to one day become a physician, return to his village of Masara, Kenya, and provide proper medical care. Dr. Bonyo not only accomplished his oath of ensuring a public health system, but he also improved the quality of life by guaranteeing every child receives vaccinations, education through high school, and he even helped the villagers learn how to farm poultry.
BKM serves a part of Kenya that is ravaged by HIV, TB, malaria and other curable diseases. Greater than 30% of the population is affected by HIV, making these patients even more susceptible to infection. Treatments that we have readily available are unfortunately not so easily attained for most of the villagers in Masara.  BKM works hard to try to provide the best possible care to those affected by HIV, and gain access to modern treatments for them. HIV was once designated as a disease of “undesirables”. This stigma is the furthest from the truth; many believe that HIV only affects homosexuals and injection-drug users, but the truth is, HIV affects more women than men in sub-Saharan Africa, and Kenya has no significant IV-drug problem. HIV in Kenya is spread primarily through heterosexual couples and by mother to child transmission.  77% of new infections are between heterosexual couples and 20,000 infants are born with HIV infection in Kenya every year. Without AZT medication mothers with HIV will pass the infection to their children, propagating another generation of victims. Education is not enough. Proper medications must be available. Within the past month, BKM has secured government allotment of HIV medications to serve those scourged with HIV in Masara. 
The leading killer in Masara, Kenya continues to be malaria. Malaria is a treatable infection that is caused by a parasite that is transmitted by mosquito. DEET and other mosquito repellants are not readily available to those who are in Kenya. 25 million of 34 million Kenyans are at risk for malaria infection.  Malaria causes 20% of deaths among children in Kenya. BKM is working hard to provide mosquito nets to every family; however, the strain of malaria most common in Masara is a fairly resistant bug, requiring a stronger therapy of mefloquine, which is of course more expensive than previous treatment methods. Many other curable diseases take lives every day in Kenya. Through the Mama Pilista Memorial Clinic, BKM now has nurses and volunteer physicians living in the clinic 24/7.
The purpose of out seven week trip to Kenya is to provide world class care to the people of Masara through any means. Dr. Bonyo has been building BKM from the group up since 1996, and though a lot has been done a lot still remains to be finished. An investment in this mission is an investment in furthering BKM’s reach. BKM is not just dedicated to providing health care to Masara; it is dedicated to passionately improve the total welfare of every single villager.

They can be held in our bodies as sensations, behaviors, feelings, beliefs, images, postures, macro and micro movement patterns, craniosacral patterns. These capacities helped us survive and get to this point in our lives, <i>but they are often not the most useful ways to be fully in our present life. </i></p><p>Through this training I will be able to deepen my capacity to work together with clients (babies, children, families and adults), supporting them in learning new ways of being with others and themselves, and to re-pattern these response templates from early adverse imprinting, while being very respectful of the compensation patterns (adaptive survival mechanisms), and support these skills when they are needed. It is only from this place that we can effectively increase the options for our lives. We then come closer to our authentic self, our true nature, and truly appreciate the health in our systems. </p><p></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""326"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FR26UdcFqZ4g%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DR26UdcFqZ4g&amp;image=http%3A%2F%2Fi1.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FR26UdcFqZ4g%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube"" width=""580""></iframe></div><br/><p></p><p><b>What Are Some Known Causes Of Early Trauma?</b><br/></p><p>

<p>All of us have experienced early stress or trauma to one level or another. Unresolved early trauma can significantly interfere with our current daily life.

It is only from this place that we can effectively increase the options for our lives. We then come closer to our authentic self, our true nature, and truly appreciate the health in our systems. </p><p>The resourcing of babies, children, families and adults will help shift the consciousness of our world toward more functional behaviors in our communities. This can only be good for our planet and our communities.</p><p>I've launched one other crowd-funding campaign in the past. It was successful in that it brought me a contributor who paid for one of the $800 foundation modules; a prerequisite for attending these advanced trainings. I am eternally grateful to her. </p><p>I am truly grateful for your attention and interest, and hope you can find a way to support my dream. Thank you!</p><p><br/></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3><p>Maybe you just can’t contribute, but that doesn’t mean you can’t help!</p><ul>

Early experiences of moderate child abuse and neglect also colored my orientation to life. Despite this, I helped raise my siblings, put myself through college and a master’s degree, survived two date-rapes, domestic violence, divorce, and a traumatic brain injury, among other challenges. These beginnings led me to seek out psychotherapy which in turn opened the pathway to massage therapy, Biodynamic Craniosacral Therapy and integrative wellness. The Perinatal Trauma Resolution approach has given me, as an adult, experiences which have repaired and continue to repair an easily activated nervous system. By continuing training in this system I will be able to bring advanced skills to support resourcing, re-patterning and repair for babies, children, adults and families. My intention, through this Indiegogo Campaign, is to expand my support of others in overcoming obstacles and rebuilding health and well-being.The advanced trainings with Myrna Martin, are designed to provide the skills required to support babies, children and adults to heal from early adverse imprinting in the prenatal and early years. The advanced curriculum includes four day trainings on each of the following topics:
Couples Therapy from an Attachment Perspective
Prematurity
In-depth work with Infants
Group dynamics in Process Workshops with Adults
Adoption
Family Dynamics and Attachment Therapy with Preschoolers and Older Children
Sand and Art Play Therapy for Children and Adults in PPN.
Two days of each training will include the latest clinical, theoretical and research material related to the topic based in: 
Neuroscience
Embryology
Attachment Theory
Obstetrics and Gynecology
Somatic Therapy
Consciousness Studies

Psychotherapy

One day will be an opportunity for each participant to do a piece of their own personal  pre and perinatal work, with support. The fourth day will be in depth case consultation and integration.  Participants and teaching assistants will have an opportunity to bring material for the case consultations.Practitioners must know the journey from within themselves and in relationship to others to be able to provide the facilitation to babies, children, parents and other adults for their journey. The skills of quiet presence, compassion, empathy, tracking the autonomic nervous system, self-regulation, somatic and verbal communication, and contact between each other, and bridging connection between others in the family or group.This work comes from the perspective that all behaviors and human conditions are expressions of inherent health. We constantly ask the questions: Where is the health in the system? Where is the resource? about an individual, group or family. All of us come to this planet with a tremendous capacity to survive and adapt from the point of preconception, conception, implantation, discovery, birth and into our life.This ability to adapt to the environment we find ourselves in leads to the particular survival skills we each developed as creative responses to early adverse, stressful or traumatic experiences. They can be held in our bodies as sensations, behaviors, feelings, beliefs, images, postures, macro and micro movement patterns, craniosacral patterns. These capacities helped us survive and get to this point in our lives, but they are often not the most useful ways to be fully in our present life. Through this training I will be able to deepen my capacity to work together with clients (babies, children, families and adults), supporting them in learning new ways of being with others and themselves, and to re-pattern these response templates from early adverse imprinting, while being very respectful of the compensation patterns (adaptive survival mechanisms), and support these skills when they are needed. It is only from this place that we can effectively increase the options for our lives. We then come closer to our authentic self, our true nature, and truly appreciate the health in our systems. What Are Some Known Causes Of Early Trauma?
Most of us have experienced some level of stress or trauma in our early life. Some was medically necessary. The long-term impact is in proportion to the severity and length of the trauma as well as the level the trauma interferes with the child connecting with its parents. Any experience is less traumatic if accompanied by loving support and connection. Some known causes of early trauma are: 


Stressful or abusive relationship between parents during pregnancy or after birth
Maternal stress, fear or depression during pregnancy or infancy
Child was not wanted for some part of pregnancy
Unwelcoming or fearful feelings at discovery of pregnancy
Considered or attempted abortion
Biochemical stresses during pregnancy from nicotine, alcohol, pesticides, etc.
Twin lost during pregnancy including early pregnancy or during birth
Chemical induction of labor
Fetal monitors that are screwed into fetus’ skull
Premature birth
NICU experience with all accompanying medical interventions
Unusually long or unusually fast labor
Being stuck during labor
Cord tightly wrapped around the neck
Near death experience or deprivation of oxygen
Medical interventions such as C-section, forceps, vacuum extraction
Anesthesia which breaks the contact between mom and baby
Separation from the mother after birth or for extended periods during infancy
Painful medical interventions such as heal sticks, spinal taps, etc.
Maternal postpartum depression or strong anxiety
Being given up for adoption
Death in the family
Unresolved traumatic history in parents or ancestors, such as early abuse, loss of a parent, traumatic birth, or being given up for adoption
Hospitalization or surgery as an infant, including circumcision
Any particularly painful accident, injury or illness

What Are Common Signs In Adults Of Early Trauma?
All of us have experienced early stress or trauma to one level or another. Unresolved early trauma can significantly interfere with our current daily life. As more recent traumatic events occur, they begin to layer on top of our earliest imprinting. In fact, our ability to recover from traumatic events as older children and adults is dependent on our resilience or lack of it due to our earliest traumatic imprinting. Teens and adults can manifest any of the signs listed under children plus:

Difficulty in forming and maintaining a healthy primary relationship with a partner
Aggression manifested as acting out, destructive or criminal behavior
Excessive timidity in everyday life
Inappropriate flight or fight response to non-threatening circumstances
Difficulty mobilizing effectively in the face of real aggression or danger
Difficulty in setting healthy limits and boundaries, saying ‘no’ when appropriate
Merging inappropriately with others to one’s own detriment
Difficulty in responding empathetically to others
Confusion, difficulty making decisions
Self-destructive behaviors such as drug and alcohol abuse, physical mutilation, over or under eating
Excessive risk taking, dangerous driving, disregarding the safety of others
Forced sex or having unprotected sex when children are not wanted
Failing to take responsibility for one’s actions, blaming others
Difficulty setting appropriate goals and working toward them
Difficulty in foreseeing the consequences of one’s actions.
Consistent difficulty with some aspect of a task: intention, preparation, action, follow through or integration.
Difficulty holding a job or establishing oneself in a satisfying career
Inability to successfully establish oneself in the world as an independent adult
Difficulties in parenting, abusive or neglectful behavior towards children

Difficulty in establishing an effective support system of family, friends, teachers, mentors, and/or professionals
