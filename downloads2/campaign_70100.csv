</p><p><b>Short Summary</b>:</p>
<p>My name is Christopher Lynn and for the past 5 years I have
been the Inventory Control Manager at a manufacturing plant in Virginia Beach,
Virginia where a lot of our employees are Filipino.  So a few years ago I am talking to a coworker
and friend about going vacation somewhere in Asia.  I don't care where yet, just as long as it's
somewhere in Asia and his comment is that I should visit the Philippines.  Now at this time my geography is hazy and I
am just like ok, sure.  I know the
Philippine Islands are somewhere over there and that's about it.  So I go there for vacation alone and just
fell in love with the country.  The
culture, the beaches (I left my heart in Boracay), the people, just everything
about it was amazing to me.  I am also
happy to say that my girlfriend of 2 years is a Filapina.  I made up my mind back then that I wanted to
live there.  This campaign is my dream.  This will allow me to move to the Philippine
Islands and also to provide the locals with gainful employment.  If you have never met a Filipino, let me tell
you they are some of the nicest people you will ever meet and they have a
great deal of pride in their work and themselves.  Every contribution no matter how large or
small gets me closer to making this dream reality.</p>
<p><b>What I Need:</b></p>
<p>Essentially funding, my goal is to raise $175,000 to open
this factory.  In the event I don't raise
the full amount I will use whatever funds that were raised to springboard another campaign and as
show money for potential investors.  I am
working with an investment company to take on a partner and if I can present
$50,000, or $100,000 it will be much easier to convince the investor that they
want to join me in a partnership to establish this business. </p>
<p>The perks for contributors: 
Even just $1.00 adds up and I will list every contributor on a dedicated page of the website which will go live with the opening of the factory so their support will always be remembered.  My goal is to raise $175,000, of that $25,000
will be spent covering the perks for contributors.  The backpacks offered in the perks will be the first ones produced in the factory!  Now I am also offering a vacation for you and
1 guest for 6 days 5 nights.  I am prohibited from offering cash or airline tickets but once you arrive in
the Philippines I will provide a hotel room at the fabulous Hotel H2O.  Every time I stay in Manila, I stay at that
hotel.  Picture 1 wall of your hotel room
is devoted to an aquarium!  It is simply
amazing.  By day you will go to the Ocean
Park for some sun and relaxation.  How about a city
tour of Manila to introduce you to the culture of the Philippines?  Shopping is an experience in
itself, locally known as malling.  Come see the famous Mall of
Asia!  While you are here you will also
be treated to a tour of the ex US Navy Base in Subic Bay and get a tour of the
factory you helped to fund! This vacation will be given away to 1 lucky contributor once the factory is operational.  I will randomly choose 1 person from all campaigns combined to come see why I love the Philippine Islands. <br/></p>
<p>The remaining $150,000 is what I need to actually start up
this factory.  It covers lease,
utilities, furniture, sewing machines, fabric cutters, utilities.  Everything I can think of from my 5 years of
experience that I feel I need.  I have
$30,000 reserved as liquid capital for expenses I didn't foresee.  Anyone who has ever tried to open a business
will tell you that no matter how much research you do, there are always unforeseen
expenses.  Plan for success.</p>
<p><b>Challenges and Risk:</b></p>
<p>This is a business, and there is always risk in business.  I have a client/supplier in one.  They will provide me with raw materials cut
to their needs and then buy back the finished products after I have sewn
them.  It's nice to know where my income
is coming from but what happens if they go out of business?  They have been around since the 1980's so this is highly unlikely but still; I plan on breaking into the local and Asian
market before the end of the first year.  There is no shortage of sewing factories in
the Philippines, but I have an established product line that I can manufacture
locally with local materials that will be of superior design and
engineering.  </p>
<p><b>Other ways to Help:</b></p>
<p>Every dollar is 1 step closer to making this goal
happen.  If you can't help financially
then just share the link.  I am going to need people once this factory opens.  If you have a relative in Subic Bay area who is a skilled sewing machine operator or sewing machine mechanic I am going to need them.  If you have a contact who is a business investor I would like to send them my business plan.  Perhaps you have a contact that runs a business and would be interested in the products we will be sewing... or a supplier of thread.  Thread is the lifeblood of a sewing factory. <br/></p><p>My sincerest thank you to everyone:</p>

</p>
<p><b>PROGRAM RATIONALE</b></p>
<p>Various research papers, as well as observations from the group sessions implemented in the early research stages have identified
participant responses stating that the negativity and stigmas associated with
mental disorders lead to feelings of disempowerment, decreased self worth, mood,
and personal drive. Resulting in an overall lowered status of mental-health
and well-being. <br/>
</p>
<p>Participants credited positive coping strategies gained by
means of expressing their emotions artistically.<br/></p>
<p>Their indicated results report:<br/>- Stress and anxiety reduction<br/>- Sleep promotion<br/>- Improvement in mood<br/>
- Increased sense of community connection<br/>- General improvement in personal ""well being""</p>
<p>""For thousands of years, people have searched for the meaning and beauty of life in music, painting, poetry and other arts. Now scientists are finding that the arts can benefit both your mental and physical health."" -News In Health<br/>
</p>
<p>In a study concerning cancer patients in the hospital; literature reports that it ""increased patients' sense of control in the hospital, promoted wellness and the healthy aspects of patients' lives, reductions in pain and increases in immunity, decreases in anxiety, and reductions in psychological and physical symptoms. In several clinical studies examining the effects of music on healing and wellness, music has been found to be a form of relaxation and anxiety reduction."" -American Journal of Public Health</p>

LET US PAINT OUR STORIES TOGETHER!

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
BACKBONE JOURNEY 

TOGETHER WE ARE POSSIBLE!
My name is Krizia ""Canvas"" Carlos and I am an artist and a nurse. My main artistic medium is dance, while I surround myself with other art forms. I am deeply passionate about arts and mental health. Specializing in the mental health field through my work as nurse in hospital wards throughout the city, I have developed a unique understanding of mental health, which most artists do not have the privilege to experience. 
In conjunction to my front line work as a nurse, my experiences traveling and immersing myself in different cultures; I have developed a distinctive understanding of the complexity of human nature through the different stories and life experiences that individuals share. Using this inspiration, I created groups that incorporated artistic activities such as music, poetry, and dance as therapeutic approaches in my practice in the ward. Through these simple activities, I began to see creativity, life, & hope in patients through their voices and their art. Although these small artistic groups were started to simply address patient ""boredom"" in the unit, I began to see the development of fresh and effective coping strategies for individuals.
Using the ""Canvas"" as a metaphor; an environment birthed where people have a ""clean slate,"" a ""fresh start"" to explore positive means of self expression. Using the ""Canvas"" as a metaphor for LIFE we understand ourselves as creators of our own he[art]work, and that WE have the power to paint our canvases beautiful and inspiring.

THE MISSIONS FUNDAMENTAL 3 E's
EXPLORE - Everyone is beautifully created as unique
individuals. Exploring and addressing the needs of each individual with
relation to their unique needs, is important in achieving and maintaining
personal ""WELL-BEING.""

EDUCATE - Knowledge is important, but the application of WISDOM is key to success. Through the use of different artistic mediums tailored to each individual need, the aim is to educate individuals in creating VALUE for themselves through the exploration and understanding of their heARTwork. This is the ""spark"" of discovering in the leader lying within. 
EMPOWER - Human beings thrive through CONNECTION. You are
not alone! We are not alone! In conjunction with gaining value in ourselves, it
is important to share positivity and strength around us to continue to fuel us
in a sustainable manner. The aim is to build strong and positive support
networks that will allow us to thrive through genuine and meaningful
connections in our communities.



PROGRAM RATIONALE
Various research papers, as well as observations from the group sessions implemented in the early research stages have identified
participant responses stating that the negativity and stigmas associated with
mental disorders lead to feelings of disempowerment, decreased self worth, mood,
and personal drive. Resulting in an overall lowered status of mental-health
and well-being. 

Participants credited positive coping strategies gained by
means of expressing their emotions artistically.
Their indicated results report:- Stress and anxiety reduction- Sleep promotion- Improvement in mood
- Increased sense of community connection- General improvement in personal ""well being""
""For thousands of years, people have searched for the meaning and beauty of life in music, painting, poetry and other arts. Now scientists are finding that the arts can benefit both your mental and physical health."" -News In Health

In a study concerning cancer patients in the hospital; literature reports that it ""increased patients' sense of control in the hospital, promoted wellness and the healthy aspects of patients' lives, reductions in pain and increases in immunity, decreases in anxiety, and reductions in psychological and physical symptoms. In several clinical studies examining the effects of music on healing and wellness, music has been found to be a form of relaxation and anxiety reduction."" -American Journal of Public Health

</p><p><b>To Serve and Empower Los Angeles and Inglewood
Communities through Martial Arts.</b></p>
<p>For more than 20 years,
Hwarangdo West L.A. Academy has stood as the beacon and standard of martial
arts training.  Thousands have
traveled from near and far to train in HwaRangDo®, the Most Comprehensive
Martial Art System in the World. 
Now, we are expanding the martial arts training started in West Los
Angeles into South Los Angeles and Inglewood community and we need little help
from you!

</p><p><span>To start, I will briefly introduce myself and provide an
overview of the great work that the HwaRangDo® West L.A. Academy has done to
support its community. My name is Antonio D. Goodwin and I am the branch owner
and head instructor of HwaRangDo ® West L.A. Academy.  I am a California native and have lived in Los Angeles for
almost 20 years.  I began training in HwaRangDo ® in 2002 under the
intense tutelage of Grandmaster Taejoon Lee and I am currently a 2<sup>nd</sup>
Degree Black Sash. In 2012, Grandmaster Lee passed ownership of the West L.A. Academy
to me and I have worked feverishly since then to not only continue to teach and
empower my students, but I have made it my life’s mission to empower and uplift
my community. </span></p>
<p>Since taking ownership of the academy, I have reached out into
the community and have developed a strong working relationship with several
organizations across Los Angeles. We have worked with non-profit organizations
in the community such as <b>My Friend’s House</b>, <i>a non-profit organization that
helps to feed and clothe the homeless</i>, and <b>Manifest Your Destiny</b>,<i> a non-profit
organization founded by Hill Harper to help empower and educate at-risk youth</i>.  We have created alliances with
<b>NoMore.org</b> and the <b>“ItsOnUs”</b> campaign to raise awareness about Domestic
Violence and Abuse.  Personally, I
have been invited to speak at several schools regarding self-defense and
self-empowerment including Wildwood High School (West L.A.), Hamilton High
School (Los Angeles), Monroe Middle School (Inglewood), William Boroughs Middle
School (Los Angeles) and Frank D. Parent School (Inglewood).  Most recently, I was invited to be the
guest speaker at the Freedom School program at Camp David Gonzales, a juvenile probation
camp, encouraging the young men there to be empowered by both knowledge of the
world and knowledge of self. </p>
<p>To date, our Academy has hosted more than a hundred Self-Defense,
Women’s Self-Defense and Bully Prevention seminars and events throughout Los
Angeles and Inglewood.   The vast majority of these classes and seminars
were provided free of charge, as I feel it is important to serve, build and
empower our community regardless of economical status.  </p>
<p><span>In January 2015, our academy moved from the location it had been
at for more than 20 years to a new and improved, safer location. I undertook
several necessary renovations to make the property more comfortable and
suitable for students and parents, and to further our mission by utilizing a
space that is clean, bright and peaceful. There are plans to continue
renovations to make the space even more comfortable and welcoming to members of
the community.  </span></p>
<p>In addition, due to popular demand I have recently partnered with<b>
Zion Temple Community Church</b> in South Los Angeles teaching Women’s Self-Defense
classes every first Saturday of the month.  I have also partnered with <b>Faithful Central Bible Church</b> to teach
Women’s Self-Defense class as well as martial arts, which includes Bully Prevention,
Self-Defense, self-awareness and a code of ethics, to the youth of the
Inglewood community every Saturday morning. The HwaRangDo West L.A. Academy
will still host a Free Self-Defense class once a month in its West Los Angeles
location.</p>
<p>Families from all walks of life in and around South Los Angeles
and Inglewood have searched for an opportunity to learn self-defense and
martial arts. Community members desire to become empowered and gain meaningful
skills that they will be able to utilize to enhance many areas of their lives
including at school, at work and at home and we aim to provide just that.</p>
<p>HwaRangDo West L.A. Academy is looking to continue outreach
into our West L.A. and surrounding communities and <b>establish a long-term HwaRangDo®
program in Inglewood and Los Angeles.</b>   Enrollment for the monthly women’s self-defense class in
South Los Angeles has already doubled within two months and continues to grow.  In Inglewood, we are expecting 15-20 children
to register this summer for weekly martial arts instruction. As word spreads,
we expect that number to also double in the coming months when factoring in the
schoolmates and family members of these children who live in the surrounding
areas. </p>
<p>In the near future, we are also working with other community
organizations and members to start other needed programs in Inglewood such as
after-school programs and summer camps. 
By assisting me in building this program, and continuing to make
improvements to our main training center in West Los Angeles, you will directly
help impact our community’s ability to maximize their human potential as self
aware, accountable, responsible leaders.  We have already been able to
effectively reach and teach hundreds of men, women and children. Ultimately,
this will allow us to reach hundreds more and allow them a resource and positive
outlet to learn the martial arts way, empower them and build productive
community members and quality leaders in South Los Angeles, Inglewood and
throughout the Los Angeles County.</p>
<p><b><br/></b></p><p><b>What We Need &amp; What You Get</b></p>
<p>Our goal of  $30,000.00
will be used to help secure our West L.A. location and create a long-term training program and curriculum specifically
geared towards the women and school-aged children in the aforementioned areas.
 Examples of necessary supplies include new portable martial arts mats,
office supplies, heavy punching bags, speed bags, jump ropes, ab balls,
medicine balls, targets and most importantly uniforms for the kids!
 </p>
<p> The teachers, kids, and people in the community are very excited about this!
 This will be the first program of its kind fashioned especially for this
portion of the community as no martial arts training for children offered in
South Los Angeles and Inglewood is as comprehensive as what we teach within
HwaRangDo.   </p><p>Our perks include everything from vouchers from free classes, free private training or life coaching session with Inst. Antonio D. Goodwin and customize workout/training packages.<br/>
<br/>
</p>
<p><b><span>The Impact</span></b></p>
<p>Every dollar raised will
not be wasted.  The new training program is going to give children a
stronger foundation in a wonderful space where they can learn how to build
their potential as a martial artist, an individual and a community leader.
 What's unique about this program is that it is being built around the
needs and requests of South Los Angeles and Inglewood communities.  There
have been smaller martial arts programs in the area but nothing like what we
are proposing.  Through your contributions, these children and young
adults will be exposed to and be able to participate in leadership seminars,
tournaments, and most importantly they will be given the opportunity to help
assist, teach and serve throughout the community and at other schools.
 <b>Empowering our community, serving humanity</b>.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b><br/></b></p><p><b>Risks &amp; Challenges</b></p>
<p>The geographic location
will be my biggest challenge to overcome because it requires me to occasionally
branch out and away from our West L.A. home in order to bring this very
important service to a community that needs it. However, I have developed and prepared a strong support system, including assistant instructors, who will
be able to help me maintain the highest level of training at the West Los
Angeles location. </p>
<p>Because of my partnerships with Faithful Central Bible Church and
Zion Temple Community Church, as well as many other wonderful community organizations
and youth programs, I believe this expansion stands a strong chance for
success.  I have partnered with well-respected organizations, built a strong
reputation through my work with testimonials as proof, and have gone about it the
right way with the community members, whom I serve, in mind every step of the
way.</p>
<p><b>Other Ways You Can Help</b></p>
<p>Can't contribute monetarily? We understand, but you can still
help! Spread the word, share this on your social networks and let people know
you believe in this effort!</p>

organizations across Los Angeles. We have worked with non-profit organizations
in the community such as My Friend’s House, a non-profit organization that
helps to feed and clothe the homeless, and Manifest Your Destiny, a non-profit
organization founded by Hill Harper to help empower and educate at-risk youth.  We have created alliances with
NoMore.org and the “ItsOnUs” campaign to raise awareness about Domestic
Violence and Abuse.  Personally, I
have been invited to speak at several schools regarding self-defense and
self-empowerment including Wildwood High School (West L.A.), Hamilton High
School (Los Angeles), Monroe Middle School (Inglewood), William Boroughs Middle
School (Los Angeles) and Frank D. Parent School (Inglewood).  Most recently, I was invited to be the
guest speaker at the Freedom School program at Camp David Gonzales, a juvenile probation
camp, encouraging the young men there to be empowered by both knowledge of the
world and knowledge of self. 
To date, our Academy has hosted more than a hundred Self-Defense,
Women’s Self-Defense and Bully Prevention seminars and events throughout Los
Angeles and Inglewood.   The vast majority of these classes and seminars
were provided free of charge, as I feel it is important to serve, build and
empower our community regardless of economical status.  
In January 2015, our academy moved from the location it had been
at for more than 20 years to a new and improved, safer location. I undertook
several necessary renovations to make the property more comfortable and
suitable for students and parents, and to further our mission by utilizing a
space that is clean, bright and peaceful. There are plans to continue
renovations to make the space even more comfortable and welcoming to members of
the community.  
In addition, due to popular demand I have recently partnered with
Zion Temple Community Church in South Los Angeles teaching Women’s Self-Defense
classes every first Saturday of the month.  I have also partnered with Faithful Central Bible Church to teach
Women’s Self-Defense class as well as martial arts, which includes Bully Prevention,
Self-Defense, self-awareness and a code of ethics, to the youth of the
Inglewood community every Saturday morning. The HwaRangDo West L.A. Academy
will still host a Free Self-Defense class once a month in its West Los Angeles
location.
Families from all walks of life in and around South Los Angeles
and Inglewood have searched for an opportunity to learn self-defense and
martial arts. Community members desire to become empowered and gain meaningful
skills that they will be able to utilize to enhance many areas of their lives
including at school, at work and at home and we aim to provide just that.
HwaRangDo West L.A. Academy is looking to continue outreach
into our West L.A. and surrounding communities and establish a long-term HwaRangDo®
program in Inglewood and Los Angeles.   Enrollment for the monthly women’s self-defense class in
South Los Angeles has already doubled within two months and continues to grow.  In Inglewood, we are expecting 15-20 children
to register this summer for weekly martial arts instruction. As word spreads,
we expect that number to also double in the coming months when factoring in the
schoolmates and family members of these children who live in the surrounding
areas. 
In the near future, we are also working with other community
organizations and members to start other needed programs in Inglewood such as
after-school programs and summer camps. 
By assisting me in building this program, and continuing to make
improvements to our main training center in West Los Angeles, you will directly
help impact our community’s ability to maximize their human potential as self
aware, accountable, responsible leaders.  We have already been able to
effectively reach and teach hundreds of men, women and children. Ultimately,
this will allow us to reach hundreds more and allow them a resource and positive
outlet to learn the martial arts way, empower them and build productive
community members and quality leaders in South Los Angeles, Inglewood and
throughout the Los Angeles County.
What We Need & What You Get
Our goal of  $30,000.00
will be used to help secure our West L.A. location and create a long-term training program and curriculum specifically
geared towards the women and school-aged children in the aforementioned areas.
 Examples of necessary supplies include new portable martial arts mats,
office supplies, heavy punching bags, speed bags, jump ropes, ab balls,
medicine balls, targets and most importantly uniforms for the kids!
 
 The teachers, kids, and people in the community are very excited about this!
 This will be the first program of its kind fashioned especially for this
portion of the community as no martial arts training for children offered in
South Los Angeles and Inglewood is as comprehensive as what we teach within
HwaRangDo.   Our perks include everything from vouchers from free classes, free private training or life coaching session with Inst. Antonio D. Goodwin and customize workout/training packages.


The Impact
Every dollar raised will
not be wasted.  The new training program is going to give children a
stronger foundation in a wonderful space where they can learn how to build
their potential as a martial artist, an individual and a community leader.
 What's unique about this program is that it is being built around the
needs and requests of South Los Angeles and Inglewood communities.  There
have been smaller martial arts programs in the area but nothing like what we
are proposing.  Through your contributions, these children and young
adults will be exposed to and be able to participate in leadership seminars,
tournaments, and most importantly they will be given the opportunity to help
assist, teach and serve throughout the community and at other schools.
 Empowering our community, serving humanity.

Risks & Challenges
The geographic location
will be my biggest challenge to overcome because it requires me to occasionally
branch out and away from our West L.A. home in order to bring this very
important service to a community that needs it. However, I have developed and prepared a strong support system, including assistant instructors, who will
be able to help me maintain the highest level of training at the West Los
Angeles location. 
Because of my partnerships with Faithful Central Bible Church and
Zion Temple Community Church, as well as many other wonderful community organizations
and youth programs, I believe this expansion stands a strong chance for
success.  I have partnered with well-respected organizations, built a strong
reputation through my work with testimonials as proof, and have gone about it the
right way with the community members, whom I serve, in mind every step of the
way.

<p>The haylog is a patent
protected, simple product that is completely new to the heating fuel market.
Using a system of hay refining equipment and a highly efficient briquetting
machine, Bragdon Farm LLC is able to take locally sourced waste hay and produce
four-pound compressed haylogs for use in any wood burning appliance. </p>
<p>What is waste hay you
ask? It is hay which has lost its nutritional value due to wet weather or humid
conditions. The waste hay cannot be sold and used as feed hay which hurts the hay
farmer’s business as a typical harvest can yield 20%-25% waste hay. This is where
we come in, Bragdon Farm will buy this burdening product which will provide a
secondary income stream to farmers while having no effect on the livestock feed
market.</p>
<p><b>Why Burn Haylogs?</b></p>
<p>Haylogs are the
all-natural, clean burning, alternative heating fuel source with a minimal carbon
impact on our environment. No binders, waxes or oils are used, making them the
most natural log on the market. On top of the cleanliness of our product, the raw
material in our logs (pure hay) produces one of the lowest carbon footprints on
the market. As multiple hay crops are harvested each year, the carbon released
while burning a log will be recaptured by the next growing cycle - which could
be as quick as a couple of months.</p>
<p>If that is not enough,
you can rest assured that burning haylogs saves trees and preserves farmland. According
to the Maine Department of Agriculture, each haylog produced preserves 100 sq.
ft. of farmland. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Can I Burn Haylogs?</b></p>
<p>Do
you have a fireplace, fireplace insert, wood stove, wood boiler, fire pit,
chiminea or any other type of wood burning device? Then the answer is yes! The
haylog acts very similar to traditional firewood – and that’s how you can treat
them. The haylogs can be burned on their own or in conjunction with firewood.
Simply start a fire using a firestarter or kindling with the haylogs to enjoy
hours of heat!</p>
<p>With a moisture
content of 12% or less, the logs are drier than a typical stick of seasoned
firewood. The lower moisture content directly translates into higher heat
production (higher BTUs) than that of firewood. Preliminary tests have revealed
the haylogs produce between 8,000 – 8,500 BTUs compared to 6,000 – 6,500 BTUs
produced by seasoned common northeastern hardwood species. Furthermore our
haylogs produced a 65% longer burn rate than our test cordwood.</p>
<p>Not
only are these haylogs clean and convenient to burn, but they are also clean
and easy to purchase, carry and store away. The logs will be available for
purchase by the case or pallet through retail destinations or factory direct.</p>

</h4><h4>
<span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: initial;"">My Background</span><br/>
</h4>
<div>I was born and brought up in Uganda during my early years. The biggest influence during my formative years was my father, a World War 2 British Army veteran who spent his career installing water supply in some of the remotest and poorest areas of the country as a water engineer. His drive, kindness, charity, generosity and sheer humanitarianism in changing the lives of the poor and needy to whom he supplied water have defined my inner character and values in life. </div><div><br/></div>
<div>I have run a business in Ghana for 14 years, operating at times under the harshest climatic conditions, devoid of power and water in remote mining areas amongst communities and people where life itself is at a premium. My community of Gomoah Nanyano in the Central Region of Ghana is a poor fishing village where daily lives skirt the very edge of subsistence survival. Their plight has focused my desire to make a life changing impact for them and future generations to come.</div><div><br/></div>
<div>My mission with your help, is to bring about sustained solutions to not only power failures but also bring to an end, shortages in clean healthy water that continues to inflict cholera and dysentery on the people of Gomoah Nanyano.</div><div><br/></div>
<h4>
<span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: initial;"">The Campaign</span><br/>
</h4>
<div>Ghana as a whole has been gripped in a crisis of epidemic proportions over the past twelve months. ""Dumsor Dumsor"" (meaning on and off) electricity power outages last for 36 hours in a 48 hour cycle. This has become a daily reality and shows no sign of relenting given the deep rooted issues related to fundamental problems in the nation's electricity supply. Like the globally recognised diseases such as HIV AIDS and the deadly Ebola virus that have become synonymous with Africa, ""Dumsor"" has become a sinister silent killer in Ghana. </div><div><br/></div>

<div>The above is an image of fatal carnage caused by a chain reaction of a malfunctioning generator leading to a calamity resulting in 200 deaths in Accra, capital of Ghana.

<div>I want to raise funds in collaboration with the INDIEGOGO community for the construction of a solar power station and a water desalination plant. A few years ago I purchased a valuable piece of land overlooking the Atlantic Ocean for a commercial proposition, but this current crisis has affected my sentiment. I have decided instead to dedicate this land to solving the problem of power and water in Gomoah Nyanyano. This is my personal financial contribution to this project. The twin power and water stations will be known as ""NSUO-KANIA"" (meaning Water &amp; Light in the Akan language of Ghana). </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Your help in this ""seed"" pilot project could revolutionise the lives in this poor community. I want to start a revolution that rolls out to the rest of Ghana if not the entire continent of Africa. With YOUR help we can make this happen together. Successfully completing this project will empower me to prove to global NGO's and institutional funders such as the World Bank to give me the mandate to build bigger projects that will help to heal people's pain and make deaths from power outages and poor water a distant memory.</div>

The knock-on effects of using nature's power in the form of the Sun and the huge reserves of water held by the Atlantic Ocean will I believe offer inspiration and hope to the rest of the world's small communities that there is a better, cleaner, safer and reliable alternative form of energy and water. Your contribution together with my fulfilment of this project may well be the catalyst to empowering small communities to take control of their own destiny and solve problems that have haunted not only countries in Africa but the rest of the world as well. By supporting 'Nsuo-Kania', you will be making a statement to world that self-empowerment is better than doling out aid.</div>

</div></div>","Catastrophic power failures and poor water are 'SILENT KILLERS' in Ghana. Deaths in 2015 have reached epidemic levels. Help build a sustainable solar power and water desalination station, to bring reliable, inexpensive energy and clean water to thousands in need, on land we are providing.

My Background

I was born and brought up in Uganda during my early years. The biggest influence during my formative years was my father, a World War 2 British Army veteran who spent his career installing water supply in some of the remotest and poorest areas of the country as a water engineer. His drive, kindness, charity, generosity and sheer humanitarianism in changing the lives of the poor and needy to whom he supplied water have defined my inner character and values in life. 
I have run a business in Ghana for 14 years, operating at times under the harshest climatic conditions, devoid of power and water in remote mining areas amongst communities and people where life itself is at a premium. My community of Gomoah Nanyano in the Central Region of Ghana is a poor fishing village where daily lives skirt the very edge of subsistence survival. Their plight has focused my desire to make a life changing impact for them and future generations to come.
My mission with your help, is to bring about sustained solutions to not only power failures but also bring to an end, shortages in clean healthy water that continues to inflict cholera and dysentery on the people of Gomoah Nanyano.

The Campaign

Ghana as a whole has been gripped in a crisis of epidemic proportions over the past twelve months. ""Dumsor Dumsor"" (meaning on and off) electricity power outages last for 36 hours in a 48 hour cycle. This has become a daily reality and shows no sign of relenting given the deep rooted issues related to fundamental problems in the nation's electricity supply. Like the globally recognised diseases such as HIV AIDS and the deadly Ebola virus that have become synonymous with Africa, ""Dumsor"" has become a sinister silent killer in Ghana. 

DUMSOR CLAIMS 200+ LIVESTHE NEW STATESMAN	 05 JUNE 2015


The above is an image of fatal carnage caused by a chain reaction of a malfunctioning generator leading to a calamity resulting in 200 deaths in Accra, capital of Ghana. All due to a power outage. This is just one disaster documented in recent months. Deaths are occurring daily all over the nation with no sign abatement.
My community in Gomoah Nanyano has suffered its fair share of deep sorrow due in particular to power outages in clinics and maternity homes.

Why my Campaign is important to me


My campaign is of great importance to me as I have seen great suffering and hardship amongst the people of Gomoah Nanyano. I have witnessed deaths of newborn babies and a worker due to sudden power failures, the latter during routine surgery.



I am fighting for clean, reliable and sustainable energy in Ghana which is blessed with an average of 4.5 hours of daily sunshine. This makes solar power a realistic solution to this current crisis. Gomoah Nyanyano's position on the Atlantic Ocean gives credence to a clean water solution for the village community. I am determined, with your help, to implement a power and water solution that can change the people's lives for the better, so that ""Dumsor"" and unhealthy water can stop killing local people. 


I want to raise funds in collaboration with the INDIEGOGO community for the construction of a solar power station and a water desalination plant. A few years ago I purchased a valuable piece of land overlooking the Atlantic Ocean for a commercial proposition, but this current crisis has affected my sentiment. I have decided instead to dedicate this land to solving the problem of power and water in Gomoah Nyanyano. This is my personal financial contribution to this project. The twin power and water stations will be known as ""NSUO-KANIA"" (meaning Water & Light in the Akan language of Ghana). 

Your help in this ""seed"" pilot project could revolutionise the lives in this poor community. I want to start a revolution that rolls out to the rest of Ghana if not the entire continent of Africa. With YOUR help we can make this happen together. Successfully completing this project will empower me to prove to global NGO's and institutional funders such as the World Bank to give me the mandate to build bigger projects that will help to heal people's pain and make deaths from power outages and poor water a distant memory.


How much money is needed from you & how it will be spent



In order to construct a very basic solar power station that generates electricity together with a water desalination plant on my land at Gomoah Nyanyano, I have set a target of US$315,000. This would provide simple stations to cater for the essential power and water needs of a part of the community. 


To give you an idea, one acre of installation would cost approximately US$500,000 in the USA! (Based on a proportion of 5 acres producing 1 Megawatt of electricity enough to power 300 homes!). On the basis of this yardstick, I am trying to squeeze both the solar power station plus the water desalination plant within a budget of US$315,000.

The total area of my land is 7 acres. I propose to utilise one and a half acres initially based on a basic funding budget (this is currently the maximum area I am permitted to construct upon without further permits). One acre will be applied to building a solar panel power station consisting of:



A Target Power Output of 120 Kilowatts of A/C Electricity
This would create enough power for 20 houses, the community Health Clinic, Maternity Clinic, Local School and the Village Police Station



PROJECTED COST OF SOLAR POWER STATION: US$ 200,000

1. Purchase of 20 Pallets (26 Panels Per Pallet) of solar panels at US$6,500 a pallet: US$ 130,000
2. 55-400kW PVI central inverters, TOP
     BRAND, AC rated power: 55-400kW (depends on model), AC rated
     voltage: 400/320V (depends on model) , AC output:
     3-phases, Modular architecture: 55kW block units, Efficiency of
     up to 98% (-TL), IP20, LV isolation transformer
     included, Delivered pre-configured and pre-tested, Warranty: 5
     years producer warranty: US$ 15,000
3. Photovoltaic
Controllers, Storage Battery Cells, Cabling to Homes and Institutions as
stated: US$ 30,000
4. Installation Engineers x 2, Consultancy fee of Manufacturer, Local Labour, Transportation, Ghana Customs & Excise Prevention Levies, 24/7 On-Site Security, Building equipment, Local currency fluctuation tariff: US$25,000

PROJECTED COST OF WATER DESALINATION STATION: US$ 115,000

The remaining half an acre will be used to house the water desalination plant together with an appropriate water tower tank to retain clean water supply.
Construction of this will take place simultaneously with the solar power station. 



Desalination water station housing Reverse Osmosis salt water conversion and filtration system, inclusive of extraction pump and inward pipes: US$ 60,000
Desalinated water pump, piping to water tower tank, cost of erecting water tower tank (30,000 imperial gallon capacity), tank filtration system. labour, installation consultancy, 12 months maintenance contract: US$ 55,000



This current funding would create the above to fulfil the construction of this twin project. If your generosity helps me to surpass this monetary target, I will apply the extra funds as follows:



Apply for planning permission of a larger solar power station on the rest of my land, to roll out greater wattage of electricity for more homes.
To invest funds in underground water pipes to essential institutions such as the Health Clinic and Maternity Home plus provide hot water to the same via thermal solar panels so that hot water can be used for sanitation purposes.
To buy a sanitised water supply carrier tank vehicle (similar to a large Semi fuel tanker) to transport water to the village of Gomoah Nyanyano.


What happens to the funds raised if I fail to hit my target?


In the event that I fail to reach the financial target I have set, I will update my page here on INDIEGOGO with a revised plan involving a down sized solar power and desalination water station. I will do this so that I may re-present my case for more funding to try and attain my initial goal. I never give up, and I will keep fighting to change the lives of people in my community until I attain my goal!

The Impact


An accurate assessment of the impact of your contribution cannot be estimated or quantified at this embryonic stage of this project. I sincerely believe that your success in making  'Nsuo-Kania' a reality will create a positive impact in empowering a small community that could inspire future generations and be replicated in all communities in Ghana. Empowerment is the very essence of this project, because you will be empowering a small community and ""seeding"" a project that is a template for the provision of clean renewable energy and essential water in the whole of the continent of Africa.

By supporting 'Nsuo-Kania', you will be making a statement to world that self-empowerment is better than doling out aid.


Risks & Challenges


Undertaking a practical project in any country in Africa poses problems, challenges and risks. There are risks of security, harsh landscape, poor roads and underdeveloped infrastructure to name but a few.
For a foreigner (I am a British citizen) such a project would be a herculean task. All of the above issues would have to be surmounted plus the most essential attribute required to undertake any venture successfully in Africa is to have an intimate and working knowledge of local customs, cultures, regional dialects and credibility amongst government bodies, for example Ghana CEPS (Customs). Without a proven working knowledge and track record of all of the above it is nigh impossible for a foreigner to succeed in any African country. 
I know Ghana inside out. I have lived and worked in the country and in the mining sector of the Central Region of Ghana. I have been in my community for 14 years and understand the motivation, psyche and mindset of the various tribes of Ghana, and none more than the Fante tribe that makes up the majority of Gomoah Nyanyano.

tourist traps. 
And you can return the favour! 
 Sign up and be a tour guide yourself!
You
can also sign up as a guide in your area, and set a fee to help travelers enjoy
their visit to your area, each guide/local will be reviewed by the travelers,
so we can all have the best experiences.
The Impact
This
is a ground-breaking opportunity for singles, couples and families who travel
and want to meet local residents.  It’s important to create safe and open
connections for the global gay community. 
With
all the amazing ways that LGBTQ people
can connect, it will be a beautiful and magical world when Guide Me Away can help ensure that LGBTQ travelers are welcome everywhere
we go.  We will be stronger if we band together, help protect our fellow
travelers, connect our travel friends with other locals, and have fun being who
we are no matter where we go!
What We Need
Guide Me Away is almost ready to
launch.  And we’ll need to get the word
out, but that’s not going to be easy.  
Our
goal is to raise $25,000 or more.
We
want to encourage you to give any amount; there is NO AMOUNT TOO
SMALL!  Every little bit helps and gets us that much closer to our
goal!  This money goes toward:
Start-up
costs: design & branding, finishing the user interface, debugging the
website, insurance, and initial marketing expenses to get the word out.
Development
and maintenance: Outsourcing all the other things I can’t do alone. (The
platform that we are working on for over 7 month was built from scratch!)
Marketing!
While this site is going to have lots of Vancouver tours, I need to expand the
reach so that everyone will know about the website!

play with at the amusement park?  Or is a socialite with all the right
connections more your speed?  Make something up!  We won’t hold you

<p>Our objective
is to build<b> a community centre for villagers, and particularly women</b>, to use as
a space for <b>education and training, and for sharing of experiences.</b></p>
<p>In the
villages of Wayanad district, women are usually <b>financially dependent</b> on male
family members and are restricted to roles of caregiver and food gatherer. They
also do not venture into public spaces or socialise much outside close family
gatherings. Discrimination against women has further limited their access to
education and financial independence.</p>
<p>At Rasta our target group has been
women who have little or no access to education or who stopped studying due to
personal or social factors. Towards this
end we have already conducted for them <b>group farming projects and taught
them bamboo handicraft production, tailoring and designing clay ornaments</b>.</p>
<p>However, these women often do not
have a common meeting space to share their experiences. Also, the climate at Wayanad does not allow for regular
outdoor training activities. This is where a community centre building will
enable us to bring together all our activities under <b>one roof</b> and give these
women and villagers a space to<b> develop their skill</b>s.</p>
<p>At the
community centre we want to provide <b>training to women in vocational skills</b>,
which will help them augment their family income, be financially <b>independent</b>
and go on to <b>become confident members</b> of the community. We want to create a space where we
can train local women in skills that will improve their quality of life. They
will be able to generate income and also support each other in building skills in
leadership, resource managem<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">ent and entrepreneurship development.</span></p>
<p>For
this dream to become a reality we need your <b>help in completion of the building

contribution on your part will make a world of difference to our efforts. Once
the infrastructure is in place,<b> we can implement the projects </b>that we already

<p>Women
in the area have already expressed eagerness to join our courses. Not only will
they <b>directly benefit from

</div></div>","The Plan to Overthrow Dhaba Patriarchy...... by not just claiming public space, but owning it. The problem: As women and sexual minorities in Karachi, we are constantly suffocated in male-dominated public space, and our access to streets and spaces of leisure is limited due to cultural norms and threats of safety.Our pitch: We want to make a small dent in Karachi's male-dominated public space by setting up a dhaba (roadside tea-stall) within the next year -- a pocket of oxygen that is inclusive, safe and welcoming for women and minorities who just want to chill on the streets and have a (cheap) cup of chai.

About #GirlsAtDhabas
#girlsatdhabas is a community of women, feminists and activists who want to claim male-dominated spaces in our communities that are not traditionally ""supposed"" to be occupied by women and sexual minorities, or are considered inaccessible and hostile spaces for us.
 
After hanging out at dhabas having chai, chilling on sidewalks and engaging in similar 'scandalous' activities, we felt our own fears and cautions diminish, and a heightened sense of ease and ownership over our city. We began sharing our experiences with other women on social media through hashtags - #girlsatdhabas and #girslplayingstreetcricket - and hosted street cricket matches (typically unsual for women) in Karachi and Lahore. 
Receiving media coverage from Buzzfeed, BBC, NYTimes, and various Pakistani and Indian publications has helped us refine our mission and grow our initiative's visibility. 

#GirlsatDhabas in the press:

BuzzFeed: Here's why South Asian women are uploading photos of themselves at dhabas

BBC: How drinking tea became an act of female rebellion

NYTimes: Pakistani women use selfies to reclaim tea stalls (actually they're photos, NYT)

The Quint: Gender: Hang out with these girls at dhabas


#girlsatdhabas has received submissions and attention from across the subcontinent. We recently held a discussion about women & public space at a local university where ~150 students showed up. We recognize that the issue of women's access and visibility is close to many hearts, and now want to channel that energy into collective sustainable action.

                                        
                                        
Chai Chahiyay… Public mein janaab! / Claiming the str33ts
#DhabaForWomen is our dream for a safe and inclusive dhaba/tapri where women can just feel comfortable hanging out for long hours. Dhaba/chai culture in South Asia is male-dominated, and we want to encourage women to participate in it, and own it for themselves. 
            
We plan for this dhaba to serve as a resource base to run activities; host workshops, dialogues, and campaigns around gender and feminism; and facilitate women to come together and address issues of public space access and harassment. 

            
[#girlsatdhabas dialogue at Institute of Business Administration, Karachi on women in public space]


Our goal of $10,000 will go towards renting a dhaba space, getting it up and running in 3 months, initial maintenance costs and providing transport and security for all staff.

Stage 1: Setting up the #DhabaForWomen
Stage 2: Turning the dhaba into a space that runs regular activities, workshops, dialogues and campaigns about women + gender + public space
Stage 3: Expanding leisure activities that tend to be male-dominated, such as starting a motorcycling club*
Stage 4: Making it a base-camp for women's rights advocates and activists

Every contribution will be valuable. 
*women rarely drive bikes in Karachi, and when we ride as passengers, we typically sit sideways because it is considered taboo for us to spread our legs.

We are rapidly approaching a humanitarian crisis in the country, so I have decided to take action.</p><p>Fueled by the ever growing voices from Greece and the diaspora, the ""Opa! I Support Greece"" campaign aspires to write a new chapter in the epic journey that has become Greece. Having offered us over 4,500 years of History, Culture and Democracy, Our story doesn’t end here today in crisis or with a return to the status quo. Our story will attempt to unite the global community to chart a future worthy of our shared past.

<p style=""margin-bottom: 15.0pt;"">Greece has offered the world so much, and has a lot more to offer, but the average person in Greece is suffering now; with unemployment hovering around 50%, and a rapidly shrinking economy many families are at the point of having difficulty putting food on the table.

What remains after these costs, will go 100% towards food coupons from the national supermarket chain Sklavenitis, to those Greeks that are unemployed (verified by their unemployment card, or have demonstrated their need to any other charitable organization or the Greek Church) Each 50 euro coupon can sustain a family of four for about a week.<br/></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 15.0pt;""><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""><span style=""font-size: 26pt; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(26, 26, 26);"">Donate, help, get perks &amp; enjoy what Greece has to offer!</span></b></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 15.0pt;"">So go ahead, I challenge you to support Greece, and you can have fun in doing so, because you will receive a taste, a drink or a souvenir from Greece, or maybe even an actual stay in Greece that you can cherish, all the while knowing that your contributions are helping people in dire need!

</div>","Be part of our story
Hi there! My name is Alexi Faraco and I'm the organizer of the ""OPA! I support Greece"" campaign! As a Greek American businessman I have grown tired of sitting on the sidelines watching, while the situation in Greece continues to deteriorate. We are rapidly approaching a humanitarian crisis in the country, so I have decided to take action.Fueled by the ever growing voices from Greece and the diaspora, the ""Opa! I Support Greece"" campaign aspires to write a new chapter in the epic journey that has become Greece. Having offered us over 4,500 years of History, Culture and Democracy, Our story doesn’t end here today in crisis or with a return to the status quo. Our story will attempt to unite the global community to chart a future worthy of our shared past. Be part of our story.Austerity is destroying average
Greek’s standard of living
Greece has offered the world so much, and has a lot more to offer, but the average person in Greece is suffering now; with unemployment hovering around 50%, and a rapidly shrinking economy many families are at the point of having difficulty putting food on the table. While talk of billions and bailouts abounds, this means nothing to the average Greek; what they have to look forward to now is increased austerity, higher taxes and a greatly diminished standard of living.Let’s make a differenceThat’s why I have designed the ""OPA! I Support Greece"" campaign, to highlight a very few of the many wondrous products and services that come from Greece. We are offering a wide range of perks that will provide each generous donation at EVERY level with a maximum return for the money you donate. What is your goal, guys?Although we have set a very low and realistic goal of $100,000, we would really like to see this campaign raise $1 million in the month that it will run, so we can make a meaningful difference for the Greek people. If we are successful we will continue with more campaigns that will continue to showcase much more of what Greece has to offer, and being able to keep helping those in need!What about the perks? Who will they benefit?Almost all perks are from small Greek family operated businesses that can showcase their products, and services which will help them survive, stay in business and to keep their employees. In many cases they have supplied us with below market value prices, or donated their goods to help as much as they can as well. What remains after these costs, will go 100% towards food coupons from the national supermarket chain Sklavenitis, to those Greeks that are unemployed (verified by their unemployment card, or have demonstrated their need to any other charitable organization or the Greek Church) Each 50 euro coupon can sustain a family of four for about a week.Donate, help, get perks & enjoy what Greece has to offer!So go ahead, I challenge you to support Greece, and you can have fun in doing so, because you will receive a taste, a drink or a souvenir from Greece, or maybe even an actual stay in Greece that you can cherish, all the while knowing that your contributions are helping people in dire need! Every perk level is very competitive and you will be getting all natural, locally sourced products from small family farms and businesses, that will do a world of good for them and the Greek people and YOU will be making a DIFFERENCE! What else can I do? Spread the word for the “Gyro Eating Challenge”!At the very least you can accept our Gyro eating challenge! Eat a gyro for Greece and challenge those you know to support Greece by eating a gyro, and making a donation. We will upload ALL your videos here and on youtube, that you send us to: info@opaisupportgreece.com. We would like to see your videos come in from all corners of the world, no matter where you are! OPA! And Kali Orexei!Is there anything else I can do to help you guys?Yes, sure! We need you to spread the word around and become ambassadors of our vision and goal. Share our campaign on your social media, email it to your coworkers, friends and family, or whomever else you might think of!
Can you do that? This will be more than ok for us!Every contribution helps; even for a postcard from Greece, but if you cannot and can help in any other way I would like to hear from you, do you have an interesting idea or suggestion? Let me know!
You can email me for whatever you want at info@opaisupportgreece.com and tell me what you can do!

<p>At the University of Florida Honey Bee Research and Extension Lab (UF HBREL),
we are all about pushing the boundaries of knowledge in our field and making
scientific discovery accessible to the public. We believe that by backing this
project, you will be helping us do just that!</p>

My name is Tomas Bustamante. I have been working in
the UF honey bee lab for three years as a volunteer, lab technician and masters
student. In order to complete my masters thesis, I designed a series of
computer programs that our research team used to measure different physical
characteristics of honey bees from images quickly and easily. Now we want to
take those programs and integrate their features while adding significantly
more features. This will allow us to create a single, intuitive application
that can be used by professional researchers and citizen scientists alike.<p></p>
<p><i></i></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1440524377/xhtasugfbcvh9mzyufqa.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><i></i></p><p><i>""Measuring things in pictures?
That sounds like something that other programs already do.” </i>You are right - in a way. There are other,  pretty neat, general-purpose scientific
software packages, such as <a href=""http://imagej.net/ImageJ2"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span>ImageJ</span></a>, that
allow the user to measure the length, angles or other types of features in an
image. Our project draws much of its inspiration from programs such as that.
What distinguishes <i>MorphoMetric</i> from
other software options is that it will be designed to be accessible enough for
citizen scientists to use while also being robust enough for the
high-throughput data collection and management that professional research
demands.</p>
<p>Even though this effort is starting in
a honey bee lab, <i>MorphoMetric</i> has the
potential to help a lot of different people working with all types of organisms.
Somewhere, right now, there is an undergraduate student who needs to design a
good research project in order to graduate with honors, a beekeeper who needs
to do a research project to become a <a href=""http://entnemdept.ufl.edu/honeybee/extension/master_beekeeper.shtml"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span>master beekeeper</span></a>, and a hobbyist scientist who is wondering how
similar that population of beetles she collected while visiting her relatives
are to those in her back yard. There is also a high school science teacher who is
trying to teach his students the basics of insect anatomy and a scientist who
is trying to develop a method to monitor certain subspecies of invasive insects
(that was me!). <i>MorphoMetric</i> will be
useful to these types of individuals and even more! </p>
<i>Perhaps none of those people have the money for
a microscope. </i>However,
the hardware needed for microscopy has become so accessible <a href=""http://www.instructables.com/id/10-Smartphone-to-digital-microscope-conversion/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span>that anyone easily can make their
own microscope at home</span></a>. I
think that it is about time for the software to catch up.<div>
<br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1440524077/i2toj9lmvxibkn6dvyzc.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h3>Design Principals and Core Features</h3>
<p></p>
<p>The following design principals are
the ideals around which <i>MorphoMetric</i>
will be built. I also list a few example core features that will be a part of
the program.  </p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Versatile -</b> 
      The user will be able to
     measure the following parameters using the software: length, angles,
     percent pigmentation of a defined area, coordinate point, count data, area,
     curvature, perimeter, and more! The user will be able to customize his/her
     software for each project so that they do not have to waste time sifting
     through features they are not going to use. </li>
<li>
<b>Intuitive - </b>There are a lot of software packages used
     in research today that are not intuitive or easy to learn. This will not
     be the case for <i>MorphoMetric</i>. The
     software will be designed so that anyone, whether scientist or school
     student, can use it without fighting a steep learning curve.  Many tasks will feel natural with just
     one or two clicks and more complicated tasks will be accompanied by
     menu-wizards that guide new users. </li>
<li>
<b>Accessible - </b>A lot of software used in research is
     very difficult for new or non-professionals to use. <i>MorphoMetric</i> will be created with
     the citizen scientist in mind. This includes, among other things,
     making it work with a diverse set of image formats and exporting data in
     common, everyday file formats that do not require specialized software with
     which to work. <i>MorphoMetric</i> also
     will be accessible through the Honey Bee Research and Extension Lab
     website and written in Java so that it will be compatible with many
     different computer operating systems.</li>
</ul>
<div>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1440524739/miz91vltdvuw5cz7lnce.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Project-Orientated</b> - <i>MorphoMetric</i> will be structured in such a way that it helps researchers, whether professional or hobbyists, organize their projects. Each project will have its own data, settings, and design details so that people running multiple projects can manage them with ease.</li>
<li>
<b>Teamwork - </b>I had the pleasure of working with a great team of people during my time as a masters student. One challenge, however, was keeping the team organized as they collected data. <i>MorphoMetric</i> will internally organize the images that are being analyzed and by whom so that teammates are not getting in one another’s way or accidentally taking redundant measurements.</li>
<li>
<b style=""background-color: initial;"">Sharing - </b><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Sharing ideas, project designs and data is a big deal in the academic
world. </span><i style=""background-color: initial;"">MorphoMetric</i><span style=""background-color: initial;""> will make sharing
easy. It also will include options for storing data on externally accessible
database servers so that collaborators and teams can work together even across
long distances. Project templates also will let users share their entire
project design with others, letting them more easily follow along with, repeat
or add to their work.</span>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<h3>Miscellaneous Features</h3>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1444157120/fter29tln0h3kxlhudkz.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 24px; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 30px; background-color: initial;""></span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<b style=""font-weight: bold;"">Automatic
     Calibration - </b>Many of the newer microscope/camera systems save
     magnification and image resolution data with the images taken. <i>MorphoMetric</i> will be able to read
     this information on supported systems automatically and calibrate itself
     for taking the most precise measurements. This feature saved our team time
     and helped us avoid the potential for significant error with data
     accumulation in my research. Simple two-click manual calibration will remain
     available for individuals not using a new microscope/image capture system.
     </li>
<li>
<b style=""font-weight: bold;"">Automatic
     Sorting - </b>A common problem shared by many microscope/camera
     systems is that they save all of their images into a single folder,
     leaving you to sort through them manually and associate them with the
     correct specimens. <i>MorphoMetric</i>
     will have configurable auto-sorting that will let you sort your images
     with ease.</li>
<li>
<b style=""background-color: initial;"">Crowdsourcing Tools (Tentative) -</b><span style=""background-color: initial;""> Many researchers do not have the budgets or
lab space necessary to harbor the teams needed to complete large-scale
morphometric projects. </span><i style=""background-color: initial;"">MorphoMetric</i><span style=""background-color: initial;"">
will include tools that will let these researchers coordinate with the
communities that support them or even let citizen scientists within these
communities design their own projects to implement.</span>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 30px; background-color: initial;"">Time and Money</span><br/></p> <p><b></b></p>
<p><b>Costs - </b>Fortunately, we have many resources available for our use at the University
of Florida. We mainly lack sufficient funds to cover the labor costs associated
with developing the software. Our financial needs include costs for:</p>
<ul>
<li>designing
     and programming new features, </li>
<li>integrating
     features present in the prototype into the new design, </li>
<li>testing,
     modifying, and retesting to make sure the final product matches all of the
     design principals, and</li>
</ul>
<div><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1440524981/nhmvk9cx8l0x6ccmmjl2.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p></div>
<p><b></b></p>
<p><b>Timetable</b> - The project will last for <b>six months </b>if funded fully. I
include below a tentative project outline. Be sure to check back for updates to
the schedule.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Month
     1:</b> Planning and building the background software
     architecture. </li>
<li>
<b>Month
     2:</b> Most of the basic elements (different
     measurements types, handling images, saving data, basic user interface,
     etc.) will be programmed this month.  </li>
<li>
<b>Months
     3 and 4:</b> In the third and fourth months, we will
     finish developing the basic element, fix associated bugs, and work on
     developing the supporting features (database support, organizing teams,
     making project templates, etc.). </li>
<li>
<b>Months
     5 and 6:</b>  The final two months are all about
     polishing the final product. There will be additional bugs to fix, help
     documentation to create, etc.  </li>
</ul>
<div><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1440528937/crnjdqbtvceglbgmrqmz.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 605.911px; height: 410px;""/>
</p></div>
<p><b></b></p>
<p><b>Underfunding</b> - If we fail to reach our full funding goal, we will develop as much
of the software package as possible, but possibly omit some less necessary
features.  </p>
<p><b>Overfunding and Extra Time</b> - If the project
receives more funding than needed to develop the envisioned software, we will
add more features and work with a design team to increase the product’s
aesthetics. A version of <i>MorphoMetric</i>
will be released at or around the 6 month mark, and new versions will be made
available as new features are added with the extra funding. </p>

<p></p>
<p><i>MorphoMetric</i> is a
project that has the potential to help many different groups of people. Here
are some of the things it could facilitate: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Faster
     Research! </b>- The prototype for <i>MorphoMetric</i> was developed while conducting my thesis research.
     It was extremely useful for collecting all of the data in an accurate and
     timely manner. We believe that by focusing on the features that made the
     prototype fast and easy to use for my team, we can make a program that
     will help other research teams similarly! </li>
<li>
<b>Make
     Education</b> <b>Easy! </b>- As a student, I found that
     one of the most challenging things about doing science was learning the
     ins and outs of all of the different tools available to conduct research.
     We believe that by focusing on making new tools that are designed to be
     intuitive and easy to teach, we can give other students more time to learn
     the scientific concepts they really need to know without having to work
     against a technological learning curve. </li>
<li>
<b>Identifying
     and Monitoring Invasive Pests</b>- I have had the
     opportunity to work with the Florida Department of Agriculture and
     Consumer Services Apiary Inspection Team over the years, observing the
     techniques that they use to monitor for Africanized honey bees. Integrating
     <i>MorphoMetric</i> into their current
     system would cut down the time that it takes to identify and monitor these
     and possibly other invasive pests. </li>
<li>
<b>Citizen
     Science!</b> - Everyone at the UF HBREL is a huge
     advocate of citizen science projects.  One of our goals is to make MorphoMetric
     easy enough to use that anyone can pick it up and begin using it right
     away. </li>
<li>
<b>Save
     The Bees!</b> - While this project has the potential to
     benefit a lot of different people, we are still honey bee scientists at
     heart. We want to be able to continue our work studying honey bee
     populations, whether wild or domesticated, and we believe that having this
     tool will help us do that. Please help us save the bees!</li>
</ul>

<p><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 30px; background-color: initial;""></span></p>

<p></p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 30px; background-color: initial;"">Risk Assessment</span></p>
</div> <p></p>
<p>There are risks inherent to donating to any project. Here are some of the
ways that we will address the risks associated with this project:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Security</b> - Giving
     support to crowdfunded projects is a great way to help new ideas become
     reality, but we have all heard the horror stories of people running off
     with other people's money without attempting to complete their projects. That
     is not going to happen here. The funds received will be deposited directly
     into an account maintained for the UF HBREL by the UF Department of
     Entomology and Nematology. This means that no one other than the principal
     investigator can have access to the funds.</li>
<li>
<b>Accountability
     -</b> I believe it is important to be held
     accountable by people with greater experience and authority so that the
     project goals can be met.  I will be
     supervised by associate professor of entomology Dr. Jamie Ellis. Dr. Ellis
     has managed hundreds of research projects with many people in the past. </li>
<li>
<b>Experience</b> -
     The previous project on which I worked for my thesis requirements had a
     larger budget and more people working on it than will this project. The
     experienced I gained managing a large project makes me confident that I
     can see this project through to conclusion. </li>
<li>
<b>Technical
     Skills</b> - Keeping this project in-house instead of
     contracting with a software company will save on costs. My undergraduate and
     graduate training front load me with the technical experience needed to complete
     the project. </li>
<li>
<b>Release
     Date</b> - The goal is to complete the project 6 months
     after receiving the funding in full. We will keep everyone informed about
     the process as things develop.</li>
</ul>

<h3>More About Me</h3>
<p></p>
<p>I am currently a master's student in the HBREL at the University of
Florida. I grew up in Orlando and moved to Gainesville attend college. I have
always had a love for the natural world, and I developed a love of technology
as I grew older. I was not able to choose between the two for my formal
education, so I pursued and received my undergraduate degree in zoology with a
minor in computer science.  </p>
<p>I got involved with the UF HBREL as a volunteer after taking a beekeeping
course in the last semester of my undergraduate coursework. Following this, I
was hired as a lab technician and accepted as a graduate student in 2013. I
have been involved in some great extension programs at the lab, which, among
other things, have made me especially interested in making science more
accessible to the general public. I believe that making better and
easier-to-use technologies, such as <i>MorphoMetric</i>,
is one important way of accomplishing this goal. It also helps knowing that the
software will make it easier for scientists to progress in their own research
as well. </p>

<h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
<div>
<ol>
<li>
<b>What is
     <i>MorphoMetric</i> exactly?</b> <br/>
<i>MorphoMetric</i> is a computer
     program that can be used to take measurements of anatomical features
     imaged using a microscope. <br/><br/>
</li>
<li>
<b>Who is
     the intended user of <i>MorphoMetric</i>?</b><br/>
<i>MorphoMetric</i> is for science
     hobbyists, professional researchers, students, teachers and citizen
     scientists. Really, it is for just about anyone with an interest in doing
     science that requires them to take physical measurements. <br/><br/>
</li>
<li>
<b>Who are
     you?</b><br/>
     I am a student at the UF HBREL with a love for the biological sciences and technology. You can see my picture of me before I grew a beard on <a href=""http://entnemdept.ifas.ufl.edu/honeybee/people.shtml"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span>our website</span></a>. <br/><br/>
</li>
<li>
<b>Aren't you a honey bee lab? This isn't a project about honey bees. Why are you doing this?</b><br/>
     I have a passion for making science more accessible to everyone. Plus, after
     much consideration, our lab team thought that the software would be useful
     to other researchers trying to overcome some of the challenges we faced.
     That includes other researchers who are working with honey bees or just
     about any other type of organism! <br/><br/>
</li>
<li>
<b>I am
     sure your lab is conducting other bigger-budget projects. Why can't you
     pay for the project yourself?</b><br/>
     The way university labs work is that resources from grants or donations are
     allocated to a specific project and cannot be used to support other
     projects. There are some general-purpose resources that are an exception
     to this, because they are provided by the university itself, for example lab
     space, common-use computers, office space, chairs, etc. However, most
     things, such as money or labor, can only be used for the projects designated
     by the sponsor. This is good because it means that funding never goes to a
     project that it was not intended to support. However, it also means that
     we need to ask for more funding whenever we want to do a new project. <br/><br/>
</li>
<li>
<b>What is
     the deal with this prototype that you keep mentioning?</b><br/>
     I made a prototype of <i>MorphoMetric</i>
     in order to complete my research for my master's thesis in entomology. It
     is very simple and does not include half of the features that I envision including
     in the final version; but it exists. Here is a link to a short video of
     it. <br/><br/>
</li>
<li>
<b>Why are
     there pictures of insects all over this page?</b><br/>
     I thought that the campaign page could use some decoration to break up the
     wall of text. What better way to do this than with stunning examples of
     the beauty that we get to see using our microscope? <br/><br/>
</li>
<li>
<b>Did you
     really build a microscope out of your cell phone and stuff from the
     hardware store?</b><br/>
     Yeah! It is pretty cool. I keep it at my desk and play around with it
     every once in a while. There are so many common place things that are
     really awesome when you look at them up close.<br/><br/>
</li>
<li>
<b style=""background-color: initial;"">What if I have more questions or even suggestions?<br/></b><span style=""background-color: initial;"">You can email me directly at g4spar@ufl.edu with any questions, suggestions or
concerns. Please do not hesitate to email me about the project. Hearing from
you will help me make better decisions about the campaign and the project in
general.</span>

</div></div>","The Short StoryWe are making a free computer program to streamline the collection of measurements from images that could have applications in ecology research, citizen science, conservation, monitoring for invasive pests, and education. Please consider backing us so that we can create this very useful software.
The Full Story
At the University of Florida Honey Bee Research and Extension Lab (UF HBREL),
we are all about pushing the boundaries of knowledge in our field and making
scientific discovery accessible to the public. We believe that by backing this
project, you will be helping us do just that!

My name is Tomas Bustamante. I have been working in
the UF honey bee lab for three years as a volunteer, lab technician and masters
student. In order to complete my masters thesis, I designed a series of
computer programs that our research team used to measure different physical
characteristics of honey bees from images quickly and easily. Now we want to
take those programs and integrate their features while adding significantly
more features. This will allow us to create a single, intuitive application
that can be used by professional researchers and citizen scientists alike.
""Measuring things in pictures?
That sounds like something that other programs already do.” You are right - in a way. There are other,  pretty neat, general-purpose scientific
software packages, such as ImageJ, that
allow the user to measure the length, angles or other types of features in an
image. Our project draws much of its inspiration from programs such as that.
What distinguishes MorphoMetric from
other software options is that it will be designed to be accessible enough for
citizen scientists to use while also being robust enough for the
high-throughput data collection and management that professional research
demands.
Even though this effort is starting in
a honey bee lab, MorphoMetric has the
potential to help a lot of different people working with all types of organisms.
Somewhere, right now, there is an undergraduate student who needs to design a
good research project in order to graduate with honors, a beekeeper who needs
to do a research project to become a master beekeeper, and a hobbyist scientist who is wondering how
similar that population of beetles she collected while visiting her relatives
are to those in her back yard. There is also a high school science teacher who is
trying to teach his students the basics of insect anatomy and a scientist who
is trying to develop a method to monitor certain subspecies of invasive insects
(that was me!). MorphoMetric will be
useful to these types of individuals and even more! 
Perhaps none of those people have the money for
a microscope. However,
the hardware needed for microscopy has become so accessible that anyone easily can make their
own microscope at home. I
think that it is about time for the software to catch up.

Design Principals and Core Features

The following design principals are
the ideals around which MorphoMetric
will be built. I also list a few example core features that will be a part of
the program.  


Versatile - 
      The user will be able to
     measure the following parameters using the software: length, angles,
     percent pigmentation of a defined area, coordinate point, count data, area,
     curvature, perimeter, and more! The user will be able to customize his/her
     software for each project so that they do not have to waste time sifting
     through features they are not going to use. 

Intuitive - There are a lot of software packages used
     in research today that are not intuitive or easy to learn. This will not
     be the case for MorphoMetric. The
     software will be designed so that anyone, whether scientist or school
     student, can use it without fighting a steep learning curve.  Many tasks will feel natural with just
     one or two clicks and more complicated tasks will be accompanied by
     menu-wizards that guide new users. 

Accessible - A lot of software used in research is
     very difficult for new or non-professionals to use. MorphoMetric will be created with
     the citizen scientist in mind. This includes, among other things,
     making it work with a diverse set of image formats and exporting data in
     common, everyday file formats that do not require specialized software with
     which to work. MorphoMetric also
     will be accessible through the Honey Bee Research and Extension Lab
     website and written in Java so that it will be compatible with many
     different computer operating systems.






Project-Orientated - MorphoMetric will be structured in such a way that it helps researchers, whether professional or hobbyists, organize their projects. Each project will have its own data, settings, and design details so that people running multiple projects can manage them with ease.

Teamwork - I had the pleasure of working with a great team of people during my time as a masters student. One challenge, however, was keeping the team organized as they collected data. MorphoMetric will internally organize the images that are being analyzed and by whom so that teammates are not getting in one another’s way or accidentally taking redundant measurements.

Sharing - Sharing ideas, project designs and data is a big deal in the academic
world. MorphoMetric will make sharing
easy. It also will include options for storing data on externally accessible
database servers so that collaborators and teams can work together even across
long distances. Project templates also will let users share their entire
project design with others, letting them more easily follow along with, repeat
or add to their work.



Miscellaneous Features





Automatic
     Calibration - Many of the newer microscope/camera systems save
     magnification and image resolution data with the images taken. MorphoMetric will be able to read
     this information on supported systems automatically and calibrate itself
     for taking the most precise measurements. This feature saved our team time
     and helped us avoid the potential for significant error with data
     accumulation in my research. Simple two-click manual calibration will remain
     available for individuals not using a new microscope/image capture system.
     

Automatic
     Sorting - A common problem shared by many microscope/camera
     systems is that they save all of their images into a single folder,
     leaving you to sort through them manually and associate them with the
     correct specimens. MorphoMetric
     will have configurable auto-sorting that will let you sort your images
     with ease.

Crowdsourcing Tools (Tentative) - Many researchers do not have the budgets or
lab space necessary to harbor the teams needed to complete large-scale
morphometric projects. MorphoMetric
will include tools that will let these researchers coordinate with the
communities that support them or even let citizen scientists within these
communities design their own projects to implement.



Time and Money 
Costs - Fortunately, we have many resources available for our use at the University
of Florida. We mainly lack sufficient funds to cover the labor costs associated
with developing the software. Our financial needs include costs for:

designing
     and programming new features, 
integrating
     features present in the prototype into the new design, 
testing,
     modifying, and retesting to make sure the final product matches all of the
     design principals, and



Timetable - The project will last for six months if funded fully. I
include below a tentative project outline. Be sure to check back for updates to
the schedule.


Month
     1: Planning and building the background software
     architecture. 

Month
     2: Most of the basic elements (different
     measurements types, handling images, saving data, basic user interface,
     etc.) will be programmed this month.  

Months
     3 and 4: In the third and fourth months, we will
     finish developing the basic element, fix associated bugs, and work on
     developing the supporting features (database support, organizing teams,
     making project templates, etc.). 

Months
     5 and 6:  The final two months are all about
     polishing the final product. There will be additional bugs to fix, help
     documentation to create, etc.  




Underfunding - If we fail to reach our full funding goal, we will develop as much
of the software package as possible, but possibly omit some less necessary
features.  
Overfunding and Extra Time - If the project
receives more funding than needed to develop the envisioned software, we will
add more features and work with a design team to increase the product’s
aesthetics. A version of MorphoMetric
will be released at or around the 6 month mark, and new versions will be made
available as new features are added with the extra funding.

Impact



MorphoMetric is a
project that has the potential to help many different groups of people. Here
are some of the things it could facilitate: 


Faster
     Research! - The prototype for MorphoMetric was developed while conducting my thesis research.
     It was extremely useful for collecting all of the data in an accurate and
     timely manner. We believe that by focusing on the features that made the
     prototype fast and easy to use for my team, we can make a program that
     will help other research teams similarly! 

Make
     Education Easy! - As a student, I found that
     one of the most challenging things about doing science was learning the
     ins and outs of all of the different tools available to conduct research.
     We believe that by focusing on making new tools that are designed to be
     intuitive and easy to teach, we can give other students more time to learn
     the scientific concepts they really need to know without having to work
     against a technological learning curve. 

Identifying
     and Monitoring Invasive Pests- I have had the
     opportunity to work with the Florida Department of Agriculture and
     Consumer Services Apiary Inspection Team over the years, observing the
     techniques that they use to monitor for Africanized honey bees. Integrating
     MorphoMetric into their current
     system would cut down the time that it takes to identify and monitor these
     and possibly other invasive pests. 

Citizen
     Science! - Everyone at the UF HBREL is a huge
     advocate of citizen science projects.  One of our goals is to make MorphoMetric
     easy enough to use that anyone can pick it up and begin using it right
     away. 

Save
     The Bees! - While this project has the potential to
     benefit a lot of different people, we are still honey bee scientists at
     heart. We want to be able to continue our work studying honey bee
     populations, whether wild or domesticated, and we believe that having this
     tool will help us do that. Please help us save the bees!





Risk Assessment
 
There are risks inherent to donating to any project. Here are some of the
ways that we will address the risks associated with this project:


Security - Giving
     support to crowdfunded projects is a great way to help new ideas become
     reality, but we have all heard the horror stories of people running off
     with other people's money without attempting to complete their projects. That
     is not going to happen here. The funds received will be deposited directly
     into an account maintained for the UF HBREL by the UF Department of
     Entomology and Nematology. This means that no one other than the principal
     investigator can have access to the funds.

Accountability
     - I believe it is important to be held
     accountable by people with greater experience and authority so that the
     project goals can be met.  I will be
     supervised by associate professor of entomology Dr. Jamie Ellis. Dr. Ellis
     has managed hundreds of research projects with many people in the past. 

Experience -
     The previous project on which I worked for my thesis requirements had a
     larger budget and more people working on it than will this project. The
     experienced I gained managing a large project makes me confident that I
     can see this project through to conclusion. 

Technical
     Skills - Keeping this project in-house instead of
     contracting with a software company will save on costs. My undergraduate and
     graduate training front load me with the technical experience needed to complete
     the project. 

Release
     Date - The goal is to complete the project 6 months
     after receiving the funding in full. We will keep everyone informed about
     the process as things develop.





More About Me

I am currently a master's student in the HBREL at the University of
Florida. I grew up in Orlando and moved to Gainesville attend college. I have
always had a love for the natural world, and I developed a love of technology
as I grew older. I was not able to choose between the two for my formal
education, so I pursued and received my undergraduate degree in zoology with a
minor in computer science.  
I got involved with the UF HBREL as a volunteer after taking a beekeeping
course in the last semester of my undergraduate coursework. Following this, I
was hired as a lab technician and accepted as a graduate student in 2013. I
have been involved in some great extension programs at the lab, which, among
other things, have made me especially interested in making science more
accessible to the general public. I believe that making better and
easier-to-use technologies, such as MorphoMetric,
is one important way of accomplishing this goal. It also helps knowing that the
software will make it easier for scientists to progress in their own research
as well.

Frequently Asked Questions



What is
     MorphoMetric exactly? 
MorphoMetric is a computer
     program that can be used to take measurements of anatomical features
     imaged using a microscope. 


Who is
     the intended user of MorphoMetric?
MorphoMetric is for science
     hobbyists, professional researchers, students, teachers and citizen
     scientists. Really, it is for just about anyone with an interest in doing
     science that requires them to take physical measurements. 


Who are
     you?
     I am a student at the UF HBREL with a love for the biological sciences and technology. You can see my picture of me before I grew a beard on our website. 


Aren't you a honey bee lab? This isn't a project about honey bees. Why are you doing this?
     I have a passion for making science more accessible to everyone. Plus, after
     much consideration, our lab team thought that the software would be useful
     to other researchers trying to overcome some of the challenges we faced.
     That includes other researchers who are working with honey bees or just
     about any other type of organism! 


I am
     sure your lab is conducting other bigger-budget projects. Why can't you
     pay for the project yourself?
     The way university labs work is that resources from grants or donations are
     allocated to a specific project and cannot be used to support other
     projects. There are some general-purpose resources that are an exception
     to this, because they are provided by the university itself, for example lab
     space, common-use computers, office space, chairs, etc. However, most
     things, such as money or labor, can only be used for the projects designated
     by the sponsor. This is good because it means that funding never goes to a
     project that it was not intended to support. However, it also means that
     we need to ask for more funding whenever we want to do a new project. 


What is
     the deal with this prototype that you keep mentioning?
     I made a prototype of MorphoMetric
     in order to complete my research for my master's thesis in entomology. It
     is very simple and does not include half of the features that I envision including
     in the final version; but it exists. Here is a link to a short video of
     it. 


Why are
     there pictures of insects all over this page?
     I thought that the campaign page could use some decoration to break up the
     wall of text. What better way to do this than with stunning examples of
     the beauty that we get to see using our microscope? 


Did you
     really build a microscope out of your cell phone and stuff from the
     hardware store?
     Yeah! It is pretty cool. I keep it at my desk and play around with it
     every once in a while. There are so many common place things that are
     really awesome when you look at them up close.


What if I have more questions or even suggestions?You can email me directly at g4spar@ufl.edu with any questions, suggestions or
concerns. Please do not hesitate to email me about the project. Hearing from
you will help me make better decisions about the campaign and the project in
general.

<p>If this business were to succeed, not only would it help realise Christine's dream, but it would also be the first business of it's kind in her area.

We love supporting local industry and we would like to share our success with those who share our love for socks. </div>
<div>With your help, in November this year we will launch a new range of socks to be sold by individuals in townships.

that cake toppers have stood the test of time but they are a bit boring to say
the least. We're out to change that one “Amazing Cake Topper” at a time! Help
us establish this initiative to serve people in need of a solution for their
lackluster cakes. For a low cost gets an “Amazing Cake Topper” to an individual
and it can light up their birthday, holiday or baby shower.  Another added
benefit to the Amazing Cake Topper is it will create a memory that will last
forever if kept under appropriate conditions. So after the cake is gone and the
party is over, you will have this wonderful memory of your special event. 
When we plan parties we scrutinize over every last detail and often times it is
hard to make the cake stand out with spending a lot of money on a cake
designer.  Now you can have a professional cake at a fraction of the
price.  Empower us to make this vision a reality with a donation to this

<p>Did you know that 30% of desserts in the
US are decorated cakes and another 15% are regular cakes and 25% are
cheesecakes, pound cakes and ice cream cakes? That is a lot of cakes to be
topped.– This fact prompted us to dig deeper into a solution.  This is
where we started to envision “Amazing Cake Topper” and all the possible
benefits we could bring to people:</p>
<p>· A fun and exciting way to celebrate.</p>
<p>· A memory that will last forever if
kept under appropriate conditions.</p>
<p>· A way to brighten up a plain cake.</p>
<p>When reviewing these benefits, features
and much more, it inspired and assured us that this is a business. We feel if
executed properly we can reach a large market of people in need of an easier
way to make their cakes stand out.  Our features will make us incredibly
qualified to succeed in the industry.  This paired with attention to
detail and quality service will make us a key player if not leader in the
industry. Our mission is to take care of every funder, supporter and customer
with the upmost respect and care.  We feel this will be the key to our
growth.</p>

</div></div>","Our popular culture reinforces the idea
that cake toppers have stood the test of time but they are a bit boring to say
the least. We're out to change that one “Amazing Cake Topper” at a time! Help
us establish this initiative to serve people in need of a solution for their
lackluster cakes. For a low cost gets an “Amazing Cake Topper” to an individual

benefit to the Amazing Cake Topper is it will create a memory that will last
forever if kept under appropriate conditions. So after the cake is gone and the
party is over, you will have this wonderful memory of your special event. 
When we plan parties we scrutinize over every last detail and often times it is

designer.  Now you can have a professional cake at a fraction of the
price.  Empower us to make this vision a reality with a donation to this
project today!                
Did you know that 30% of desserts in the
US are decorated cakes and another 15% are regular cakes and 25% are
cheesecakes, pound cakes and ice cream cakes? That is a lot of cakes to be
topped.– This fact prompted us to dig deeper into a solution.  This is
where we started to envision “Amazing Cake Topper” and all the possible
benefits we could bring to people:

· A memory that will last forever if
kept under appropriate conditions.

and much more, it inspired and assured us that this is a business. We feel if
executed properly we can reach a large market of people in need of an easier
way to make their cakes stand out.  Our features will make us incredibly
qualified to succeed in the industry.  This paired with attention to
detail and quality service will make us a key player if not leader in the
industry. Our mission is to take care of every funder, supporter and customer

growth.

<p></p></div>","Our Innovative Solution!

Our
primary mission and principle enterprise is to give all business
owners (specifically, small to mid-size companies) a forum for
addressing negative reviews posted online via crowd-sourced, business
review and social networking sites! Such as, but not limited to:
Yelp, Angie’s List, Google Reviews and many others. Thereby, giving
the business owner an opportunity to rebut and express their side of
the story, using our proprietary video and text formats!> If you haven't already, please review our Above ""Introduction"" Video! > Then Watch Our ""Follow up Video"" Below! 

Why
is it important that our campaign gets funded?

2Sides2 is completely a start-up venture operating on a shoestring budget. In order for us to accomplish our initial goals, we need operating capital for a new website with a new integrated infrastructure design. Currently 2Sides2.com is ""only"" a freshman presentation website. 
Additionally, and just as importantly, we need marketing capital for presenting our innovative solution aggressively. These funds will be used for promoting our creative strategies which are specifically intended to maximize our exposure to our core audiences, the small business owner and the general buying public. 
These are paramount initiatives for us to bring forth our conception into the arena of an actual working 2Sides2 solution for achieving our ultimate goal, ""empowering all small business owner with an exciting and creative way to rebut negative reviews posted online!"" 


What
makes our project most unique? :)
This idea has never been broached before and is sorely needed for all business owners, but more specifically, the small to mid-size business owner!Strategy SummaryOur obtainable goal is to see 2sides2.com linked synonymously with all business social media networking review sites. We will accomplish this in a two fold process. First, by introducing 2sides2.com to business owners and then secondly, informing the general buying public about 2sides2.com. We will accomplish this by reaching out to both verticals through various print, radio, youtube presentations, press releases, cross country promotional tours and radio/tv marketing campaigns. 
Enthusiastically, 2sides2.com will be presented to potential reviewers as the “new” social media resource for gathering information about their local businesses, while establishing a “brand new” platform and tool for all business owners to rebut their negative reviews posted online. Simultaneously establishing a customer-centric experience for all those who encounter 2sides2.com!

</p>
<p>The
Museo Bicknell, one of the jewels in the crown of the Italian Riviera and its
deep-rooted culture, is in danger of becoming derelict because of lack of
funding. This museum and cultural centre, created by Clarence Bicknell over 100 years ago,  is of great interest to researchers, tourists and the local community. Please give generously to this campaign launched by the Bicknell
family and help save the museum from closure.</p>
<h3>Who we are<br/>
</h3> I'm Marcus Bicknell, Clarence Bicknell's great grand nephew. I have made it a mission to help secure the future of the Museo Bicknell and to celebrate the 2018 centenary of Clarence's death with new academic research, European-wide exhibitions, TV and a new biography. We have even created the Clarence Bicknell Association in France, Italy and the UK to support the cause ... <a href=""http://www.clarencebicknell.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.clarencebicknell.com</a><br/>While state and local funding in Italy reaches rock bottom, we'll give whatever support we can to the museum and its staff. You can contact me via ...<br/><a href=""mailto:info@clarencebicknell.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">info@clarencebicknell.com</a><br/><br/>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p></p>
<p>We need about €100,000 to secure the next two years of the museum during which the management will be able to put more secure public funding in place. Please give whatever you can; all monies will be paid to the museum without any deduction. We have not yet been able to define swag and other perks with the museum's management but you can be sure of a warm welcome when you visit the place and the gratitude that's due. Big donors will be given a choice of swag items.<br/></p>
<p></p>
<h3>Some history<br/>
</h3>The museum was founded by Clarence Bicknell himself, in
Bordighera in 1888 where he lived. The British settlers already had a library
in the 1870s and Clarence was keen to have space to display both those books,
his own books and his growing collection of plants and drawings. He was one of
the prime movers in raising the necessary finance and completing the building.
The neo-medieval design was most likely by an English architect, Clarence Tait.
The building has a rectangular plan and is preceded by a porch. Inside there is
a raised choir that makes it look like a church, but which was, an is, used as
a stage or podium for presentation of all kinds. The interior, which is used as
a reading room and auditorium, was one of the principal meeting places for the
British colony of Bordighera.<p></p>
<p>The Museo Bicknell is still a working library, home to
Clarence Bicknell’s library (including many botanical drawings), over 85,000
books, 3,000
magazines on the local area’s history, art and archaeology, 14,000
reproductions of rock engravings by Clarence and his collection of butterflies,
one of the best in Europe. There are also paintings by Pompeo Bordighera
Mariani (1857-1927), and ancient maps and manuscripts dating from the 13th to
the 20th century</p>
<p>His work was continued by his nephew Edward Berry, British
Vice-Consul who with his wife Margaret wrote an interesting guide of art
history in the area: The Western Gate of Italy. They were supported actively
by Prof. Nino Lamboglia, whose Historical &amp; Archaeological Society founded
in 1932 was generously supported by Margaret Berry. The Museo Bicknell was
later integrated into the Istituto Internazionale di Studi Liguri along with
their other museum in Genoa.</p>
<p>The fig tree <i>(Ficus macrophylla or magnolioïde)</i>
planted by Clarence at the gate is a more common sight in Australia and New Guinea where they are called
banyan trees. It has done so well in the climate of the Italian Riviera that it
is now 8.6 metres in circumference, about 21 metres high and has proliferated
wildly, destroying walls, the roadway and the gate itself. The wisteria on the
front of the museum has done just as well but has been trimmed enough over time
to be ornate and decorative.</p>
<p>Today the museum serves as a research centre and a community centre; art exhibitions, seminars and concerts help animate the place and raise funds. <br/></p>
<p></p>
<h3>The management<br/>
</h3>The staff of the museum, led by Prof. Daniela
Gandolfi,  are expert and passionate about Clarence and act as a centre
for research, conferences and further publications on the subjects dear to
Clarence’s heart. Two assistants can only be paid for a few hours a week so the opening hours of the museum are very limited.<br/><br/><p>Contact:

</div> <div> <h3>The financial needs<br/>
</h3>
<p><b>The Museo Bicknell... Marcus Bicknell in
conversation with Dott. Daniela Gandolfi, the Museum’s Director:</b></p>
<p>1) What does the Museo Bicknell do, and why is
it special?</p>
<p><span>The Museo</span> <span>Bicknell, with its park and its collections, is still one of the great tourist
attractions of the cultural and scientific town of Bordighera at the West end
of Liguria, Italy. It houses the library of
the International Institute of Ligurian Studies, one of the leading Italian specialist libraries, with over 113,000 volumes
and significant archival
collections. As part of its activities
we hold conferences, exhibitions, lectures, concerts, readings,
exhibitions of painting / sculpture, and illustration courses in botany.</span></p>
<p>2) Why
does the Museo Bicknell need money, and how much does it need, year by year
going forward ten years?</p>
<p><br/>
<span>- The Museo Bicknell
needs funding because of the economic crisis that has affected
Italy
in recent years. Public bodies have drastically reduced their contributions, in some cases as much as 100%. <br/>
- The Museo Bicknell
requires an annual subsidy of € 50,000 euros and therefore of the next 10
years, € 500,000 euros.</span></p>
<p>3) Why
do the people who funded it in the past not fund it so much any more, and who
are they exactly?</p>
<p><br/>
<span>The institutions do
not fund the museum because of
the severe economic crisis that
has hit Italy. The
organizations that financed the Museum are: Province
of Imperia, Prefecture of Imperia, Liguria Region, the Ministry of Heritage and Culture, City of Bordighera.</span></p>

</div><br/></div>","Short Summary 

The
Museo Bicknell, one of the jewels in the crown of the Italian Riviera and its
deep-rooted culture, is in danger of becoming derelict because of lack of
funding. This museum and cultural centre, created by Clarence Bicknell over 100 years ago,  is of great interest to researchers, tourists and the local community. Please give generously to this campaign launched by the Bicknell
family and help save the museum from closure.
Who we are
 I'm Marcus Bicknell, Clarence Bicknell's great grand nephew. I have made it a mission to help secure the future of the Museo Bicknell and to celebrate the 2018 centenary of Clarence's death with new academic research, European-wide exhibitions, TV and a new biography. We have even created the Clarence Bicknell Association in France, Italy and the UK to support the cause ... www.clarencebicknell.comWhile state and local funding in Italy reaches rock bottom, we'll give whatever support we can to the museum and its staff. You can contact me via ...info@clarencebicknell.com

What We Need & What You Get 
We need about €100,000 to secure the next two years of the museum during which the management will be able to put more secure public funding in place. Please give whatever you can; all monies will be paid to the museum without any deduction. We have not yet been able to define swag and other perks with the museum's management but you can be sure of a warm welcome when you visit the place and the gratitude that's due. Big donors will be given a choice of swag items.

Some history
The museum was founded by Clarence Bicknell himself, in
Bordighera in 1888 where he lived. The British settlers already had a library
in the 1870s and Clarence was keen to have space to display both those books,
his own books and his growing collection of plants and drawings. He was one of
the prime movers in raising the necessary finance and completing the building.
The neo-medieval design was most likely by an English architect, Clarence Tait.
The building has a rectangular plan and is preceded by a porch. Inside there is
a raised choir that makes it look like a church, but which was, an is, used as
a stage or podium for presentation of all kinds. The interior, which is used as
a reading room and auditorium, was one of the principal meeting places for the
British colony of Bordighera.
The Museo Bicknell is still a working library, home to
Clarence Bicknell’s library (including many botanical drawings), over 85,000
books, 3,000
magazines on the local area’s history, art and archaeology, 14,000
reproductions of rock engravings by Clarence and his collection of butterflies,
one of the best in Europe. There are also paintings by Pompeo Bordighera
Mariani (1857-1927), and ancient maps and manuscripts dating from the 13th to
the 20th century
His work was continued by his nephew Edward Berry, British
Vice-Consul who with his wife Margaret wrote an interesting guide of art
history in the area: The Western Gate of Italy. They were supported actively
by Prof. Nino Lamboglia, whose Historical & Archaeological Society founded
in 1932 was generously supported by Margaret Berry. The Museo Bicknell was
later integrated into the Istituto Internazionale di Studi Liguri along with
their other museum in Genoa.
The fig tree (Ficus macrophylla or magnolioïde)
planted by Clarence at the gate is a more common sight in Australia and New Guinea where they are called
banyan trees. It has done so well in the climate of the Italian Riviera that it
is now 8.6 metres in circumference, about 21 metres high and has proliferated
wildly, destroying walls, the roadway and the gate itself. The wisteria on the
front of the museum has done just as well but has been trimmed enough over time
to be ornate and decorative.
Today the museum serves as a research centre and a community centre; art exhibitions, seminars and concerts help animate the place and raise funds. 

The management
The staff of the museum, led by Prof. Daniela
Gandolfi,  are expert and passionate about Clarence and act as a centre
for research, conferences and further publications on the subjects dear to
Clarence’s heart. Two assistants can only be paid for a few hours a week so the opening hours of the museum are very limited.Contact:

  The financial needs

The Museo Bicknell... Marcus Bicknell in
conversation with Dott. Daniela Gandolfi, the Museum’s Director:
1) What does the Museo Bicknell do, and why is
it special?
The Museo Bicknell, with its park and its collections, is still one of the great tourist
attractions of the cultural and scientific town of Bordighera at the West end
of Liguria, Italy. It houses the library of
the International Institute of Ligurian Studies, one of the leading Italian specialist libraries, with over 113,000 volumes
and significant archival
collections. As part of its activities
we hold conferences, exhibitions, lectures, concerts, readings,
exhibitions of painting / sculpture, and illustration courses in botany.
2) Why
does the Museo Bicknell need money, and how much does it need, year by year
going forward ten years?

- The Museo Bicknell
needs funding because of the economic crisis that has affected
Italy
in recent years. Public bodies have drastically reduced their contributions, in some cases as much as 100%. 
- The Museo Bicknell
requires an annual subsidy of € 50,000 euros and therefore of the next 10
years, € 500,000 euros.
3) Why
do the people who funded it in the past not fund it so much any more, and who
are they exactly?

The institutions do
not fund the museum because of
the severe economic crisis that
has hit Italy. The
organizations that financed the Museum are: Province
of Imperia, Prefecture of Imperia, Liguria Region, the Ministry of Heritage and Culture, City of Bordighera.
4) What
is the relationship between the Museo Bicknell and the Istituto Internazionale
di Studi Liguri? What does the IISL do? Are there parts of the IISL in towns
other than Bordighera?

The Museum has been a part of the
International Institute of Ligurian Studies since 1947, based in the centre of Bordighera in
Lamboglia Nino Via
Romana 39 (Liguria,
Province of Imperia, Italy). 
The IISL is a cultural institute with the purpose of research and study into historical, archaeological and cultural
heritage, recognized by the Italian State and the
Region of Liguria. It handles a
variety of museums, archives and archaeological
areas in Ventimiglia,
Imperia, Diano Marina, Albenga, Finale
Ligure, Noli, Savona, Acqui Terme. It publishes specialist journals and monographs, organizes conferences, study days, exhibitions, specialized courses, seminars, excavations and
archaeological research and provides scientific advice to public
and private entities. 'The IISL
is divided into 13 sections scattered across Liguria
(10), Lazio (1)
and Piedmont (2).
5) What
is the status of permanent staff at the Museo Bicknell? How many people,
working how many hours a week, effecting what roles? 

- The staff of
the museum is made up of 1
Director, 2 individuals manning the Museum and the Library and one person responsible for business and IT. Because of the economic crisis the time that can be spent in the Museum (notably the salaries) has been reduced
by 50%. Currently the opening hours to the public are only
20 hours a week with
special openings when there are events.
6) What
are the roles of Daniela Gandolfi other than curator of the Museo
Bicknell?  What level of energy of proportion of her time would be taken
up at the Museo Bicknell rather than the IISL or her other roles?

- In addition to coordinating the activities of the Museum Bicknell , Dr.
Gandolfi runs the Executive Headquarters
of the International Institute of Ligurian Studies in Bordighera. She is currently
responsible for the Archaeological Museums of Ventimiglia, Diano Marina and
Albenga. She collaborates with various universities and Italian authorities.

In 2009 she was honoured by the President of the Republic Italiana the title of
Knight of the Order of Merit of the Republic .
7) Can
a person be found that Daniela trusts to animate the Museo Bicknell and
organise more regular exhibitions, seminars and visits? The value of the Museo
Bicknell can only be measured in its popularity as a site for scholars and
visitors. Is this principle agreed? Can further events be organised to animate
the fund-raising?

- The initiatives promoted by the Museo Bicknell , though very numerous and
varied , are not sufficient to fully use their heritage and its collections ;
its popularity can not be measured only as a place for scholars and visitors,
but with the fact that the Bicknell Museum is definitely a cultural heritage /

be very useful and necessary to organize other events by knowing the most Bicknell Museum
in Italy and in England , the
birthplace of its founder Clarence Bicknell ( 1842-1918 ) .
8) Who
are the decision-makers at the Museo Bicknell other than Daniela?
- The governing bodies of the Museum are represented by the President of the International Institute of Ligurian Studies (Cosimo Costa),
and by the Board of
Directors which is responsible for

<h3>Re-Launching Ras Kassa's</h3>
<p>Recently, the building that housed Ras Kassa's in Boulder, CO was purchased by Google and razed. For the last year, I have been cooking take-out meals from the Broker Inn in Boulder and have now found a place in Lafayette to reopen the restaurant. Would you be able to help us reopen?</p>
<p>I, Tsehay Hailu, opened Ras Kassa's Ethiopian restaurant in 1988 in Eldorado Springs, CO with 6 tables. In 1999, Ras Kassa's moved to 30th Street in Boulder to a much bigger restaurant. I am still the head cook for Ras Kassa's and received my Associate's degree in Culinary Arts from Front Range Community College. Now I have 28 years' experience in the restaurant business. I love to provide the people and the community I love with authentic Ethiopian cooking and an excellent cultural experience. I would like to request your support to bring Ras Kassa's back.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Our Goals and Your Perks</h3>
<p>Our goal is to raise $60,000 for capital, 6 months of operating expenses, and remodeling at the new space. Expenses in re-opening include kitchen equipment, an updated computer &amp; inventory system, rent, and a beer &amp; wine license. We will use our funds frugally to make the new space inviting and comfortable. However, we will prioritize setting up the kitchen. We estimate that after we re-open it will take 6 months until our customers have found us again and we are running as usual.</p>
<p>Choose a perk and make Ras-Kassa's re-opening happen. Then come see us at our new space to enjoy great Ethiopian food! There is little risk to you and even some savings available in the larger perks. You can redeem lunch or dinner perks at our take-out space too since we will continue to operate there also!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Your Support Brings Ethiopian Food Back to Boulder</h3>
<p>Ras Kassa's brought a unique cuisine to Boulder. Where will you get excellent Doro Wat and injera if not Ras Kassa's? Remember all those good times at Ras Kassa's? Let's keep it going! You know your sister-in-law who loves to go there when she's in town! Let's make sure you can enjoy dinner with her there during her next visit!</p>
<p>Ras Kassa's is a also stronghold for the Boulder African community. Let's keep this seat of African development in Boulder going!</p>

<h3>The Work Ahead and Your Input</h3>
<p>The restaurant business is hard but we have demonstrated that we can be a sustainable restaurant in this community. We have many, many loyal customers (we have 1,486 Facebook Friends) and we have new customers all the time. It has taken over a year in the competitive Boulder County real estate market to find the right spot - one that is central to our customers with the right size and the opportunity for growth.</p>
<p>One thing we are doing to make sure we have as many repeat customers as possible is to ask what you would like to see retained or hope to see changed in the new restaurant. Please email your ideas to me at RasKassasLafayette@gmail.com. </p>

<h3>Risks and challenges</h3><p>We are committed to this vision, we just need your support. From the 
beginning, Black Girl In Om has been led by visionaries with very few 
resources, but enormous hearts and passion. We have all been completing 
this work because we believe in it. None of us currently enjoy a steady 
paycheck or set salary. Furthermore, our amazing team of contributors 
has also been creating work that has touched the lives of hundreds of 
thousands of people of color out of the goodness of their hearts. With a
 successfully funded campaign, all of us will be even more encouraged, 
supported, and able to continue to cultivate the vision of Black Girl In
 Om for countless more women of color. If challenges arise, we will 
communicate them with you!</p>

 (BGIO), a lifestyle brand that promotes holistic wellness and inner 
beauty for women of color, is proud to announced our highly anticipated 
expansion. After a year of creating a space specifically designed to
 encourage self-care and self-love for communities of color in Chicago, 
we are eager to offer our vision to women of color all over the world. 
Through our online publication, a beautifully inviting social media 
presence and traveling assemblies, BGIO will establish a global 
community for an increasingly marginalized audience. “My 
story, the story of Black Girl In Om, is a relatively simple one that 
boils down to this: creating the change that I wanted to see for my own 
experience, and later realizing that change was what countless more 
women of color needed to see, and experience, as well.” – Lauren Ash, Black Girl In Om Founder and Creative Director One solid year in, and the growth, engagement and support of Black Girl In Om continue to astound.
 
This November marks our one-year anniversary. Since founding BGIO:
our online publication now sees 60,000 page views per month from 20,000 unique visitors. 
BGIO has facilitated wellness programs and guided more than 60 yoga and meditation sessions.
We have curated four holistic food and wellness gatherings, and held
 three wellness-oriented social gatherings, positively touching the 
lives of more than 250 women.

<li><em><em><em><em><strong>A normal trellis is bulky and flat, sometimes heavy, too.</strong></em></em></em></em></li>
<li>The MagicTreamer™ is surprisingly lightweight and small in the box. When assembled it becomes impressively large and voluminous to its 3-dimensional construction.</li>
<li><strong>Most known trellies get fixed by sticking the ends or some spikes into the soil and don´t even give reliable stand to themselves and the plant.</strong></li>
<li>The MagicTreamer™ lower part is constructed like a basket that sits in the ground completely. This improves the stability essentialy and stabilty grows with the growth of the plant.</li>
<li><strong>Standard trellises have a defined size and shape - their given one</strong></li>
<li>With the MagicTreamer™ models you decide on shape and size - by changing the placement of the rings you can build the Treamer the way you like and the way it fits your pot best. </li>
<li><strong>Bamboo sticks, plastic grids or metal frames mainly have a static function.</strong></li>
<li>The MagicTreamer™ itself is an eyecatcher, almost a sculpture. Besides that it is a trellis much more reliable and steady. Our model ""TomatoHome"" even provides some aspects of plant protection. It can be equipped with an umbrella to protect sensible plants from nasty weather. </li>

A normal trellis is bulky and flat, sometimes heavy, too.
The MagicTreamer™ is surprisingly lightweight and small in the box. When assembled it becomes impressively large and voluminous to its 3-dimensional construction.
Most known trellies get fixed by sticking the ends or some spikes into the soil and don´t even give reliable stand to themselves and the plant.
The MagicTreamer™ lower part is constructed like a basket that sits in the ground completely. This improves the stability essentialy and stabilty grows with the growth of the plant.
Standard trellises have a defined size and shape - their given one
With the MagicTreamer™ models you decide on shape and size - by changing the placement of the rings you can build the Treamer the way you like and the way it fits your pot best. 
Bamboo sticks, plastic grids or metal frames mainly have a static function.
The MagicTreamer™ itself is an eyecatcher, almost a sculpture. Besides that it is a trellis much more reliable and steady. Our model ""TomatoHome"" even provides some aspects of plant protection. It can be equipped with an umbrella to protect sensible plants from nasty weather. 
Here some overgrown examples (prototypes) :

About the campaign  
Norbert, a professional gardener, invented this
system when searching for a better solution to grow climbers on a trellis. 
After the idea was born the system was filed for
patent in Europe, USA and China. Together with Uwe, the younger brother, many
prototypes were built and many different kinds of steel tested.
Now wanting to place the system on the market a
company was founded:  U_N_limited.
(""U"" comes fom Uwe, ""N"" fom Norbert). The company now is a
""Limited"" (GmbH) and Uwe is CEO.
When having found the right typ of steel it turned
out that to get this the way wanted is a very costly matter. As a high quality
steel is wanted with dimensions and specifications defined there is no suitable
material ready on the market. The band needed has to be manufactured to
customers defaults. This only works in a realistic price segment when you order
tons of the material. It is the main obstacle to be overcome to get to serial
production. Other expenses are: Special tools and equipment for the factory are
needed. Packing: Heavy cardboard boxes have to be produced. Many minor things
have to be thought of and financed: Assembling material, screws, manuals,
mounting hook, .....
With your help we will be able to provide three
models of MagicTreamer™ the best possible way we can think of. Manufacturing
will be done in Europe. 
For your support you receive a 40% discount on the
RRP. (Limited to the first 100 units of each perk)
For the next orders you will get a discount of 30%
of the RRP.

So, don`t hesitate! Be one of the lucky owners of a brand new
MagicTreamer™ at a very special price.

  Risk

The risk is negligible. We got everything under
control:


The patent is filed.


The models offerd are tested and great. (Many
more models to come)


A supplier (Germany) for the steel with the
properties needed is waiting for our order.


The factory for production (Europe) is
preparing for start of production.

 Our team here is ready to start getting
production to start and organize delivery as soon as the first MagicTreamers™ come from production.
Our plan is to be able to start delivery by end of July. If we
don`t get the neccessary funds in time this may cause a delay. But just a
delay, nothing else!

<h3>Short Summary</h3> <p>As partners, Ed and Oona are starting up a stand up paddle (SUP) boarding tour business based in Dingle Harbour, Co. Kerry, Ireland, focusing on the wildlife in the area. Our aim is to develop a fast growing watersport into a fun tool for environmental education. By educating people in rural communities on wildlife and habitat conservation, we are enabling the preservation of these sensitive areas and the vast array of animals to be found there. </p>
<p>Ed Lacey BSc, environmental protection officer, teacher and qualified watersports instructor with 15 years of professional experience is passionate about the preservation and sustainability of these environmentally sensitive areas. </p>

<p>With a strong background in leadership roles, Oona loves the outdoors and is excited about the prospect of using her skills to promote environmental awareness and local history. </p>
<p>As a fully qualified SUP tour business, accredited by the Irish Surfing Association, we are ready to open for business except for the lack of equipment. Through your contribution to our campaign you will enable us to further the cause of Irish heritage, environmental education and preservation, fitness, and the great outdoors. </p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>We are looking for €13,500. This sum would purchase all of our necessary equipment.</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>10 Stand up paddle boards and associated accessories, paddles etc.</li>
<li>20 Wetsuits and boots (we must cater for all shapes and sizes)</li>
<li>Buoyancy aids</li>
<li>Trailer rental</li>
<li>Promotional documents</li>
<li>and all the small stuff, i.e. walkie talkies, first aid kit, binoculars, etc. </li>
</ul>
<div>As we are starting out small, operating from the back of a van and trailer, we only need a small amount of equipment to begin.  </div>
<div>We'd love to welcome all contributors to our campaign on a free SUP tour! Pre booking would be recommended, but we will do our best to accommodate everyone and anyone. We are also looking to print our logo on hoodies, t-shirts, and a variety of stickers which could be sent out upon request. We would love to meet anyone interested in helping us out, show you the sights of Dingle Town and maybe have a pint or go for a surf :-). </div>
<div>If, for some reason, we are unsuccessful in obtaining our goal amount we will use the funding we do obtain to purchase a skeleton set of equipment and then apply for an alternate source of funding later in the season to have the full operation up and running by July. </div>
<div>In a perfect world we will be fully operational by mid May, just in time for the summer tourist boom.  </div>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3>
<div>We feel that education through a fun experience will have a much longer lasting effect on the individual. While stand up paddle boarding offers wonderful exercise without over exerting oneself. </div>
<div>Stand up paddle boarding offers a unique opportunity to view wildlife in their natural habitat as SUP boarding creates almost no extraneous noise to frighten the animals away. It also allows for total emersion in the environment for the paddler with the freedom to jump in and directly interact with the water and wildlife. </div>
<div>We intend on implementing a discounted 'children's club' for the local community into our weekly schedule. The purpose of which would be to introduce kids to wildlife, conservation, and environmental education with the exciting safe medium of stand up paddle boarding, through which children can get first hand experience and lifelong learning. This strategy will be key in ensuring the protection of the environment of Dingle Harbour for the next generation. Environmental protection in concentrated small areas all over the world can add up to be much more effective than vague broad blanket solutions.  <br/>
</div>
<div>Although this is a new business venture for us, Ed has extensive knowledge of the Irish coastline and has experience in teaching, tour guiding and operating his own small business. Although Oona is new to the world of entrepreneurship, she has held management positions in a variety of areas including project management, hospitality, food service and theatre design.  </div>
<div>We are extremely excited about this endeavour and feel that it has great potential in the future. Given the opportunity, we feel that it could flourish, creating more jobs and spreading education in a rural community. We really think that this is going to work and is a worthy cause.   </div>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>Due to the nature of stand up paddle boarding and outdoor sports, we are somewhat dependant on Irish weather. We have plans in place to contend with wind, developing alternate tour routes and SUP boards with keels helping to keep the board gliding straight in heavier winds, but sadly heavy rain from time to time will halt operations. Damn Irish weather.....</p>
<p>As we are offering a different product than other watersports businesses in County Kerry, we have no direct competition. However, some operators may not see it that clearly. Our main plan in this regard is to be as diplomatic, friendly and straightforward as possible. We will very much be our own entity, not competing with prices or 'turf wars' and making Wild SUP Tours' differences very clear to our competitors.   </p>
<p>Our alternate source of funding, if Indiegogo proves unsuccessful, is a rural community stimulation grant. After speaking with the appropriate authorities, they seem interested and enthusiastic with our business plan but unfortunately the grant would only become available halfway through the tourist season. Meaning we wouldn't have equipment until mid July, essentially cutting our profits in half. </p>
<p>If we operate using a skeleton set of equipment for the first two months it would allow us to nail down our operation. So that when the busiest months of July and August hit, when we have our full set of equipment, we would be able to run more smoothly and at maximum capacity for the remaining time available.    </p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p>We fully understand that not all people will be able to make a monetary contribution. However, that is not the only way you can help. Word of mouth promotion will be one of our strongest forms of advertising, for both the campaign and the SUP tours themselves. </p>
<p>Don't forget to share this with friends and even strangers! Use Indiegogo's share tools, facebook, twitter, Instagram, email and good old fashioned face to face conversations. </p>

</div></div>","Who am I and what is this project about? I'm Joana :) and Azeitão (Portugal) is the place where I grew up. My job as a biologist led me to move to Lisboa (just 35 km north), then to Christchurch (New Zealand), back to Lisboa, and then to Lund (Sweden). I was happy living this ""scientific hop-on-hop-off"" life until the day I wasn't...on the other hand, renting my house in Lisboa as a B&B while I was away was thrilling but I regretted not being closer to visitors to make them feel (even more) at home! And every time I visited my home town during those nomad years, the idea of having a B&B here felt more and more like the right thing to do. 
I kept imagining how much people would love to walk around the town savouring the traditional pastries ""Tortas de Azeitão"" in every cafe,


riding a bike on a road between vineyards, 



running, walking, or cycling along the coastal roads,





sun bathing in the clear sands, paddling, kayaking, canoeing, or diving in the calm bays and blue (or maybe they're green!) waters of Arrabida's Marine Park,



wine and cheese tasting,



birdwatching and hiking in Arrábida's Natural park,



or just simply relaxing, enjoying the calm atmosphere of Azeitão, with family, friends, or on your own.
So here I am, back in Azeitão, owning a XVI-XVII century house ready to become the cosiest B&B in town! This house has the perfect location as you can easily walk anywhere (did I mention the original and most delicious ""Tortas"" are sold just 2 minutes across the street??), park your car on the street just opposite the main entrance, there are no buildings on the back covering the hilltop view. But it will require a major refurbishment to become the home I want to welcome you in during your vacation in this beautiful area. 

The Funding
 Let's make it happen!
Rebuilding the house will be costly so I need your help to get 100.000 € (or more) to tear down the old walls, remove all the garbage, built new and well-insulated walls, set a new and levelled floor, install safe and environment-friendly water and electrical systems, close the new house with energy-efficient windows, and top it up with a new roof and an amazing terrace. The original doors, shutters, water pipes, and hard wood from the floor will be kept and reused on bed headboards, shelves, towel racks, and to build the big table where we will all have brunch soon.
I know this is a great amount of money but that's exactly why I'm calling for your help - if you buy your stay now, I can get the house ready next summer. Even if the goal is not entirely reached, you will get your perk...although later than expected. 
Work will start in a few weeks, and because I want to be fully transparent on where your money will be used, I'll be constantly updating the progress of the reconstruction and upload photos and videos showing how far we've come to make it happen!

fitness program for women. At femPowered, we're talking back to the
fitness industry at large, building a network of fitness specialists
and connecting them with individuals for online training. Our goal is
to get women access to fitness training and accurate information about their health,
whether they live in a place where access is impossible or simply
hate going to the gym.</span><br/></p>
<p><b>My story, my concept</b></p>
<p>I've always been leery of the gym and all its trappings: beefy
dudes and mystery equipment—and I've heard my feelings echoed in
countless girlfriends over the years, but we just powered through,
not really thinking there could be another way. Then, I remembered: I
have a degree in dance, focused heavily on kineseology, i.e. movement
mechanics. Why not help out my friends in their living rooms with the
years of experience I've amassed on my own? It's from this idea that
my company has developed.</p>
<p>My concept is centered around two main concerns: making fitness
accessible to women in terms of ease of use (no equipment or generic
exercises) and feeling comfortable while exercising (no frantic
workout videos or creepy guys at the gym). With my unique perspective
on movement as a professional outside of the fitness industry at
large, I want to share my perspective with my clients and
trainers, the latter of which will be trained by me directly in my
movement style and philosophy.</p>
<p>The current model is simple: trainers meet regularly with their
clients over Skype to go through the client's current customized
exercise plan in real-time. Then, clients follow along with their
plans via our video library of exercises, found in our integrated
fitness software, on their own time. Clients can have as many
real-time Skype sessions as meets their needs and schedules, and,
using our messaging system, are in daily contact with their trainers
who monitor progress along the way. 
</p>
<p>On a larger scale, my aim is to diversify femPowered's scope to
extend beyond just fitness programs, addressing women's health as a
whole. Practically, this means expanding our network to
nutritionists, counselors and even doctors and nurses who can provide
online consultations in tandem with our fitness plans.</p><p><b>Our needs, your perks</b></p>
<p>I'm looking for 4000 USD to get our upfront needs met. This round
of funding will be used in several different ways. First off,
tech-wise, things need to run and integrate seamlessly in order for
our clients to get the most out of their online training. This means
the following:</p>
<p>Website development and maintenance—1000 USD</p>
<p>A computer (my net book isn't powerful enough for my needs)--1000
USD</p>
<p>Training software costs and maintenance—800 USD</p>
<p>Web cameras and high-speed internet connections for trainers—500
USD</p>
<p>App development and maintenance—500 USD 
</p>
<p>Filming and editing new videos—500 USD</p>
<p>We're also looking to advertise globally, as our business model
includes reaching women who don't otherwise have access to fitness.
This requires about 500 USD at this stage of our campaign. 
</p>
<p>Any extra money we raise will be put toward trainer education and
bonuses, expanding our software capabilities and additional videos.</p>
<p>When you invest your money into our
preliminary funding round, you can get varying levels of discounted
and free training from femPowered. Check out our perks buttons for more detailed info.</p>
<p>My long-term goal for femPowered is to create a network of women
working together to better themselves. This means a global
collaboration of women helping women, giving those without access to
accurate information or resources a chance to better themselves, and
your contribution will take us one step closer to that goal. 
</p>
<p><b style=""background-color: initial;"">Risks and Challenges</b><br/></p>
<p>This project has already seen several setbacks. Just creating the
video library alone was a Herculean task rife with technical and
human error. Without boring you with the details, let's just say we
learned a lot about what we should(n't) do next time. 
</p>
<p>In terms of future problems, I foresee our biggest hurdle to be
internet connection quality. Securing a good (or, lets be
honest—decent) internet connection is still often a challenge even
in the western world, so as we expand into areas with lower-quality
internet access, a good connection is likely to be a challenge. 
</p>
<p>To combat this problem, I will pay for my trainers to have a
high-speed internet connection and web cameras to ensure that we are
doing everything in our power to provide the best possible
connection. If the problem is coming from the client's connection, we
will steer the client toward a package with less Skype time, meeting
just once a month to check in, which could also be done over the
phone. Finally, our integrated fitness software allows for text
messaging within the program which my trainers will be encouraged to
use regularly to keep in touch with their current trainees.</p>
<p>A second challenge is one we're working through with our existing
clients already: scheduling. Clients often find themselves needing to
reschedule, sometimes in advance but often with little warning. We
have a cancellation policy in place based on which package the client
has purchased and our trainers will be well-versed in this policy. In
this way, we hope to minimize revenue loss through repeated
rescheduled sessions. Trainer cancellations are of course also
expected from time to time, but as we build our network larger, the
existence of other trainers allows for substitute trainers to step in
when these situations arise. All this said, we recognize the
importance of flexibility, as enforcing a strict, rigid policy at all
times is not in keeping with our philosophy, and our policy allows
for this kind of adaptability as needed. 
</p>
<p>So that's my campaign in a nutshell. If you can't or aren't ready to contribute
yet, we'd still love your help spreading the word about the campaign
and business in general. We've got a few clients and are getting
started hiring our first few trainers and nutrition consultants, so
if you're a trainer or looking to get fit or a nutritionist, we'd
love to hear from you. Also, please don't forget to use the Indiegogo
share tools and make some noise!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your
help!</p>

<span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Risiken &amp; Herausforderungen</span><br/>
</h3> <p> </p>
<p>Natürlich ist nicht alles so einfach, wie ich gedacht habe.
Die Welt der natürlichen Lebensmittelherstellung ist einfach noch ein Stück
weit <b>„heile Welt“ – ohne Hektik</b>, Stress, Druck und engem Zeitplan. Hier ticken
die Uhren oft viel langsamer, was bedeutet, dass der Aufbau der kompletten
GenussBoxX <b>deutlich mehr Zeit </b>in<b> Anspruch nimmt, als geplant</b>. Dadurch haben wir
im ersten Jahr sehr viel investieren müssen ohne parallel Einnahmen zu
regenerieren.  </p>
<p>Nun bin ich mit diesem Rhythmus vertraut und baue die
Partner zuverlässig im angemessenen Zeitrahmen auf. Eigentlich ist ja auch
genau das, was wir alle wollen: </p>
<blockquote>Zeit für Genuss, Zeit für gemeinsames Essen und
Zeit, um sich in Ruhe mit dem Thema Lebensmittelbeschaffung auseinander zu
setzen. Gönnen wir uns alle doch diese kostbare Zeit und lassen Fast Food und
Hektik einfach weg!</blockquote>
<p>All diese Punkte sind natürlich für die klassische
Businesswelt nicht wirklich verständlich. Die Banken können damit nicht viel
anfangen, deshalb brauche ich Dich zur Unterstützung, denn die Konkurrenz, die
nur das schnelle Geld will, schläft nicht.</p>
<p>Mir sind ein kurzfristiger Erfolg, schneller Wachstum und
ständig exponentiell steigende Umsätze und Gewinne nicht wichtig. <b>Mein Lebenstraum ist ein nachhaltiger
Aufbau der GenussBoxX, wo alle Seiten gewinnen: der Endverbraucher, der
Hersteller, die GenussBoxX und die Erde mit seinen Lebewesen. </b>Dafür stehe ich
jeden Tag mit dem guten Gewissen auf, die Welt ein Stückchen „besser“ gemacht
zu haben. Ich folge meinem Herzen und lasse mich nicht aufhalten. </p>

Wenn nun auch Du der Meinung bist, dass der Weg der
GenussBoxX der richtige Weg für uns alle ist, dann unterstütze mich jetzt mit
einem Geldbetrag Deiner Wahl. </div><div><br/></div><div>
<h3><b><i>Risks and challenges</i></b></h3>
<p><i>Of course, things are not as
easy as I thought they would be in the first place. The world of natural food
production is still a bit of an <b>“idyllic world” – without today’s hustle and
bustle</b>, stress, pressure, and narrow timeframes. Time moves at a different
pace, which means that building up the complete GenussBoxX <b>takes much more
time than planned</b>. That meant we had to invest a lot during our first year
without generating substantial income. </i></p>
<p><i>On the other hand, I have
got used to that rhythm, extending partnerships at a reasonable pace. That is
actually what we all want:</i></p>
<p><i>Time for indulgence, time for eating together, to
have the time to think about the important subject of how food is provided.
Thus, let’s all enjoy that precious time – and simply leave out fast food and
hectic life. </i></p>
<p><i>All these points are not
being understood by the classic world of business. And banks think in
completely different categories. That is why I need your support, as our
competitors – who only want to make a fast buck – never sleep. </i></p>
<p><i>For me, short-term success,
fast growth, and exponentially increasing turnovers and profits are not so
important. <b>The dream of my life is building up a sustainable structure for
GenussBoxX, making everybody winners: the consumers, the manufacturers,
GenussBoxX itself, and Planet Earth with all its creatures.</b> Thus, I get up
every morning with the good feeling of having made the world a bit of “a better
place”. I follow my heart, and nothing can stop me. </i></p>
<p><i>If you also think that
GenussBoxX is on the right track for all of us, please support me now with a
sum of your choice. </i></p>

<h3><br/></h3><h3>Zum Abschluss noch einige Worte zu unseren Werten</h3>
<section>
<div style=""padding-top: 5px;"">
<div>
<p style=""padding: 12px; margin-bottom: 8px; font-weight: 300; font-size: 15px; background-color: #fff; border-radius: 6px;"">
<strong>Werte</strong> sind heute in unserer modernen Gesellschaft ziemlich in den Hintergrund gerutscht und bei manchen Menschen sogar ganz verschwunden.
                          Auch die <strong>Unternehmenskultur</strong> in Deutschland lässt oft zu wünschen übrig. Eine Entwicklung, der wir entgegenstehen wollen. </p>
<p style=""padding: 12px; margin-bottom: 8px; font-weight: 300; font-size: 15px; background-color: #fff; border-radius: 6px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.genussboxx.de/img/Genussboxx%20am%20Tisch%20klein.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 245.94px; float: left; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; height: 157px;""/>
</p>
<p style=""padding: 12px; margin-bottom: 8px; font-weight: 300; font-size: 15px; background-color: #fff; border-radius: 6px;""><strong>Uns sind Werte sehr wichtig</strong>. Deshalb achten wir nicht nur bei uns selbst sondern auch - so gut es überhaupt geht - bei unseren Herstellern
                          auf eine <strong>gute Unternehmenskultur</strong> und dass dort die transportierten Werte gelebt werden. Doch von welchen Werten sprechen wir hier: </p>
<p style=""padding: 12px; margin-bottom: 8px; font-size: 15px; border-radius: 6px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);""><span style=""font-weight: 300; color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 15px; letter-spacing: 0px;"">Es geht darum, dass wir Eigenschaften erfüllen wie </span><b><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 15px; letter-spacing: 0px;"">Werthaltigkeit, wertvoll, Achtsamkeit mit Mensch, Tier und Natur leben, fair bleiben
                          gegenüber allen Beteiligten in der gesamten Kette und die Bewahrung von alten Traditionen, Herstellverfahren und Rezepten</span><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 15px; letter-spacing: 0px;"">. </span></b></p>
<p style=""padding: 12px; margin-bottom: 8px; font-weight: 300; font-size: 15px; background-color: #fff; border-radius: 6px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.genussboxx.de/img/Genussboxx%20im%20Freien%20klein.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 237.594px; float: right; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; height: 152px;""/>
                          Uns ist wichtig, dass der Hersteller gutes Geld verdient und nicht von Zweit- und Dritthändlern ausgenommen wird. Dass er eine <strong>reelle
                          Chance auf dem Internetmarkt</strong> hat und seine Produktion <strong>langfristig Erfolg</strong> hat. Es sollen auch durchaus Symbiosen zwischen den einzelnen
                          Herstellern entstehen, frei nach dem Motto: Gemeinsam sind wir stark! Überhaupt ist es eine wichtige Unternehmenskultur, die Vielfältigkeit
                          in gegenseitiger Unterstützung zu leben und nicht in Konkurrenz. </p>
<p style=""padding: 12px; margin-bottom: 8px; font-weight: 300; font-size: 15px; background-color: #fff; border-radius: 6px;"">Ein <strong>wichtiger Aspekt</strong> ist zudem die ""Rückführung"" der Menschen hin zum <strong>natürlichen Lebensmittel</strong>. Etwas Natürliches ist nicht unbegrenzt
                          haltbar, hat saisonale Zeiten, ist nicht immer das ganze Jahr verfügbar und schmeckt auch nicht immer gleich. Wer hier seine Geschmacksnerven
                          trainiert, wird langfristig ein <strong>richtiges Erleben beim Essen</strong> und Genießen haben, denn der Gaumen gewöhnt sich auch wieder an den <strong>natürlichen

<h2><b><i>Let me finish on a few words about our values</i></b></h2>
<p><i><b>Values</b> have somehow become history in parts of modern society, and for some
people, they have disappeared completely. <b>Corporate culture</b> in Germany also
often leaves a lot to be desired. That’s a development we want to counter. </i></p>
<p><i><b>Values are important for us.</b> Therefore, we not only take care of them on our
end, but we also – as far as possible – make sure that our suppliers cherish a <b>sound
corporate culture</b>, meaning that they live in the spirit of their food. But
which values do we actually mean?</i></p>
<p><i>Our aim is that we cherish things
such as <b>intrinsic value, attentiveness to humans, animals, and nature, fairness
against all involved in the entire chain of production and distribution,
clinging to traditions, manufacturing processes, and recipes. </b></i></p>
<p><i>It is important that the
manufacturer earn good money for great work, and not be exploited by
in-betweeners; that he get a <b>real chance at the internet market</b>,
providing <b>long-term success </b>with his production. That may also include
that individual manufacturers start kinds of cooperation – for only together,
we are strong! And generally speaking, it is an important element of corporate
culture to live the great variety in mutual support, instead of bitter
competition. </i></p>
<p><i>An <b>important aspect</b>
for us is also to “return” people to <b>natural food</b>. Of course, natural
food is not nonperishable, has its seasons, is not available throughout the
entire year, and does not always taste the same. Those who train their sense of
taste properly will – in the long run – make <b>eating a real joy</b>, as the
palate may also get reconditioned to the <b>natural taste</b> of organic and
unmodified food. </i></p>
<p><i>People should rejoice in
eating, cooking, and enjoying food! Therefore, we want to be <b>very
transparent</b> for our customers. Our customers should get the chance of
getting to know all <b>manufactories</b> during a <b>Genuss journey</b>. It
goes without saying that we attach great importance on complete declarations of
all ingredients. </i></p>
<p><i>The shops of our
manufacturers are also accessible via our GenussBoxX website, to enable our
customers to order further products directly from their favorite suppliers. We
don’t want to play hardball with contracts, but the <b>value of a handshake </b>and
an <b>oral agreement</b> has to come to life again, the way it was before the
new world of communication and legislation. That’s really an important value
for us. </i></p>
<p><b><i>Humaneness, mutual respect, and love among people will
be the future!</i></b></p>
<p><i><b>Thanks for your support. </b>Please select a sum and the respective perk for
you, and become part of the new movement in favor of regionally manufactured food
and delicacies. </i></p>

Kurzbeschreibung




Mache jedes Essen zu einem unvergesslichen Erlebnis. Komm an Bord für eine außergewöhnliche Bewegung! Jeder Bissen unserer regionalen Spezialitäten, wird Deine Art über gesunde Lebensmittel verändern. Regionale und nachhaltige Erzeugnisse für mehr Gesundheit und einen schöneren Lebensstil.
Make every
Meal to an unique pleasure - Jump

food. Regional and organic for an better health and lifestyle



Die GenussBoxX ist ein Onlineshop für regionale Lebensmittel
aus Deutschland und Österreich. Alle GenussBoxXen enthalten immer eine Auswahl
von Produkten des jeweiligen Herstellers aus seinem Bundesland. Sprich die
Länder sind in ihre Bundeslänger aufgeteilt, so dass Du eine große
Geschmacksvielfalt kennenlernen kannst. Je Bundesland gibt es einen Hersteller
pro Produktkategorie (z.B. Fruchtaufstriche, Wurstwaren usw.) Darüber hinaus
gibt es noch Sondergruppen der GenussBoxX wie „Süße Verführung“, „Spezialitäten“
und saisonale Angebote.
Es liegt mir sehr am Herzen, dass die Menschen problemlos
Zugang zu regionalen natürlichen Lebensmitteln haben und wir dadurch unsere
Zukunft und die unseres Planeten ein großes Stück weit verbessern können. 
Ich bin Linda Gärtner, komme aus der Gastronomie und
verwirkliche mit der GenussBoxX einen Netzwerkgedanken für die Zukunft. Kleine
Manufakturen und mittelständische Unternehmen können in der GenussBoxX ihre
grandiosen handwerklich und absolut natürlich hergestellten Lebensmittel und
Spezialitäten anbieten und der Endverbraucher kann die Hersteller bei uns problemlos finden.


Short description
GenussBoxX is an online shop
for marketing regionally produced food from Germany and Austria –
with the name containing the German word Genuss, literally meaning you
should enjoy the treats inside the boxes. Each GenussBoxX contains a selection
of products made by the respective manufacturer from his German or Austrian federal
state. That ensures you can enjoy a large variety of tastes. There
is one manufacturer per federal state and per product category (for instance fruit
spread, sausages and cold meat, etc.). Moreover, there are special
GenussBoxX groups such as “sweet temptation”, “delicacies”, and seasonal
offers. 
I am dedicated to ensure that people get easy access to regionally
produced natural food, so we can improve our future and that of
our planet quite substantially. 
My name is Linda Gärtner; I have my roots in the gastronomy business, and
with GenussBoxX, I am about to realize a networking idea for the future.
Small manufactories and midsize companies can offer their terrific artisanally
and naturally produced food and delicacies via GenussBoxX, making
it easy for consumers to find the manufacturers. 
(sorry, texts in the pictures only available in German - just contact me for details)


Outtakes des Videodrehs (a bisserl was zum Lachen - Something to laugh about)




Was du uns gibst & was du bekommst

What you give us & what you get




Ich habe mich entschieden, Dir für Deinen
Beitrag, wundervolle Lebens- und Genussmittel zu schenken.
Wähle einfach aus, was Dir gefällt. Jedes einzelne ist für sich etwas ganz leckeres.

I decided that in return for your contribution, I
will present you with wonderful luxury food and delicacies. 


Simply
select what you like most. Each and every gift is a very mouth-watering treat.






 



Für die GenussBoxX
benötige ich dringend neue Soft- und Hardware inkl. einem Vor-Ort-Mininetzwerk, damit
wir  jeder Zeit auf alle Bereiche für den
Shop und die Netzwerke zugreifen können. Hiermit wird auch gewährleistet, dass
wir auf den langen geschäftlichen Reisen im Zug und Bus arbeiten können, was wiederrum eine
schnellere Umsetzung der Kunden- und Partneranliegen gewährleistet. Investitionsfaktor
ca. 15.000,- Euro.


Ganz wichtig ist die
Entwicklung von einheitlichen Versandkartons mit Verpackungsmaterial auf
umweltfreundlicher Basis. Diese müssen im Voraus produziert, gelagert und zu
den Partnern gesendet werden. Kosten ca. 2.500,- Euro.


Ein wesentlicher
Faktor zur Bekanntmachung der GenussBoxX ist das Thema Marketingunterlagen, Textkorrektur und Printwerbung. Der Aufwand beträgt ca. 14.000,- Euro.


Um weitere Partner zu
gewinnen, damit du als Kunde auch bald die gesamte Geschmacksvielfalt aus
Deutschland und Österreich kennen lernen kannst, gehen wir viel auf Messen und Märkte.
Um die Reisekosten zu decken, benötige ich für 2016 ca. 4.000,- Euro.


Wir haben tolle
Anbieter, die leider keinen Versand anbieten. Hierfür muss ich die Lebensmittel
zuerst ankaufen, lagern und dann an Dich verschicken. Die Kosten für diese GenussBoxXen belaufen sich auf ca. 2.500,- Euro.


Für den Ausbau der
Werbeaktionen auf den Online-Media-Kanälen benötige ich im ersten Schritt ca. 9.000,- Euro. 



For GenussBoxX, I urgently need new soft- and hardware, including
an on-the-spot mini network, allowing us to access all parts of the shop and
the network at any time. That will make sure that we can even work while traveling
quite substantially by train or coach to visit our manufacturers. Thus, we can
much speedier take care of our customers’ and partners’ needs. Investment: about 15,000 euros.
Very important is also the development of standardized packaging units
based on environmentally friendly packaging material. They have to be produced
in advance, stocked, and shipped to our partners. Cost: about 2,500 euros.
An important factor for making GenussBoxX better known is everything
concerning marketing concepts, text editing, as well as advertising in print.
That will amount to about 14,000 euros.
To attract further partners, which help you soon to enjoy the great
diversity of tastes from Germany and Austria, we travel a lot to trade fairs
and markets. To cover travel expenses in 2016, I will need something like 4,000 euros.
We have amazing partners who unfortunately do not offer any shipping
services. That means I first have to buy the food, stock it, and then send it
to you. The cost for these GenussBoxXes will add up to around 2,500 euros.
For extending marketing campaigns at various online media channels, I
will need, for the first steps, some
9,000 euros.

Verwendung Deiner Gelder / What we will do with your money




Die Folgen Deiner Investition

Die GenussBoxX steht
für positive Veränderungen im Bereich natürlicher Lebensmittelherstellung, Verfügbarkeit
hochwertiger Lebensmittel für alle Menschen, Schonung der Umwelt, Förderung der
alternativen Landwirtschaft und den kleinen Manufakturen sowie das Vorleben von
Vertrauen und Gemeinschaft.
Schon heute arbeite
ich mit 14 tollen Partnern zusammen und es werden monatlich mehr. Es gibt sie
noch, die Menschen, die es ehrlich und gut meinen mit dem Endverbraucher und
natürlich mit der Erde. Sie arbeiten mit größter Anstrengung und mit ganz viel
Liebe an ihrem Traum, die Welt mit natürlichen und wertvollen regionalen Produkten
zu versorgen. Unsere Partner lieben das was sie tun und das schmeckt man! Durch
Deine Unterstützung kann ich Dir noch mehr Geschmacksvielfalt aus all unseren
Bundesländern und der Österreichischen Bundesländern bieten. 
Wir werden unser
Angebot regelmäßig den Jahreszeiten anpassen, immer wieder neue Ideen für Dich
kreieren und für viel Abwechslung sorgen. Aktuell findest Du auf der www.genussboxx.de Seite tolle Angebote auch für Veganer,
Menschen mit Glutenunverträglichkeit und Liebhaber der süßen Verführungen. Die
angebotenen Fleischprodukte kommen alle von artgerecht gehaltenen Tieren.


The effect of your investment
GenussBoxX
stands for a positive change in the field of natural food production,
availability of high-quality food for everyone, protection of the environment,
the promotion of alternative farming and small manufactories, as well as
exemplifying a life of trust and community. 
Today, I already cooperate with fourteen great
partners, and their number increases every month. Yes, they still exist:
honest people who have the consumer’s best interests at heart – and, of course,
the interests of Planet Earth. They spare no effort, and with lots of love,
they work at their dream of provide the world with their natural and valuable
regionally produced items. Our partners love to do what they do, and you
can taste that! Thanks to your contribution, I can offer you an even greater variety
of tastes from the sixteen federal states of Germany, as well as from the nine
federal states of Austria. 
We will keep adapting our offer to the seasons,
creating new ideas for you: thus, you will enjoy lots of variety.
Currently, our website at www.genussboxx.de offers lots of great things for vegetarians and vegans, people with
gluten intolerance, as well as those who love sweet temptations. The meat
products we offer all come from people who make a living from ethical
husbandry.

Risiken & Herausforderungen
  
Natürlich ist nicht alles so einfach, wie ich gedacht habe.
Die Welt der natürlichen Lebensmittelherstellung ist einfach noch ein Stück
weit „heile Welt“ – ohne Hektik, Stress, Druck und engem Zeitplan. Hier ticken
die Uhren oft viel langsamer, was bedeutet, dass der Aufbau der kompletten
GenussBoxX deutlich mehr Zeit in Anspruch nimmt, als geplant. Dadurch haben wir
im ersten Jahr sehr viel investieren müssen ohne parallel Einnahmen zu
regenerieren.  
Nun bin ich mit diesem Rhythmus vertraut und baue die
Partner zuverlässig im angemessenen Zeitrahmen auf. Eigentlich ist ja auch
genau das, was wir alle wollen: 
Zeit für Genuss, Zeit für gemeinsames Essen und
Zeit, um sich in Ruhe mit dem Thema Lebensmittelbeschaffung auseinander zu
setzen. Gönnen wir uns alle doch diese kostbare Zeit und lassen Fast Food und
Hektik einfach weg!
All diese Punkte sind natürlich für die klassische
Businesswelt nicht wirklich verständlich. Die Banken können damit nicht viel
anfangen, deshalb brauche ich Dich zur Unterstützung, denn die Konkurrenz, die
nur das schnelle Geld will, schläft nicht.
Mir sind ein kurzfristiger Erfolg, schneller Wachstum und
ständig exponentiell steigende Umsätze und Gewinne nicht wichtig. Mein Lebenstraum ist ein nachhaltiger
Aufbau der GenussBoxX, wo alle Seiten gewinnen: der Endverbraucher, der
Hersteller, die GenussBoxX und die Erde mit seinen Lebewesen. Dafür stehe ich
jeden Tag mit dem guten Gewissen auf, die Welt ein Stückchen „besser“ gemacht
zu haben. Ich folge meinem Herzen und lasse mich nicht aufhalten. 

Wenn nun auch Du der Meinung bist, dass der Weg der
GenussBoxX der richtige Weg für uns alle ist, dann unterstütze mich jetzt mit
einem Geldbetrag Deiner Wahl. 
Risks and challenges
Of course, things are not as
easy as I thought they would be in the first place. The world of natural food
production is still a bit of an “idyllic world” – without today’s hustle and
bustle, stress, pressure, and narrow timeframes. Time moves at a different
pace, which means that building up the complete GenussBoxX takes much more
time than planned. That meant we had to invest a lot during our first year
without generating substantial income. 
On the other hand, I have
got used to that rhythm, extending partnerships at a reasonable pace. That is
actually what we all want:
Time for indulgence, time for eating together, to
have the time to think about the important subject of how food is provided.
Thus, let’s all enjoy that precious time – and simply leave out fast food and
hectic life. 
All these points are not
being understood by the classic world of business. And banks think in
completely different categories. That is why I need your support, as our
competitors – who only want to make a fast buck – never sleep. 
For me, short-term success,
fast growth, and exponentially increasing turnovers and profits are not so
important. The dream of my life is building up a sustainable structure for
GenussBoxX, making everybody winners: the consumers, the manufacturers,
GenussBoxX itself, and Planet Earth with all its creatures. Thus, I get up
every morning with the good feeling of having made the world a bit of “a better
place”. I follow my heart, and nothing can stop me. 
If you also think that
GenussBoxX is on the right track for all of us, please support me now with a
sum of your choice.

Zum Abschluss noch einige Worte zu unseren Werten




Werte sind heute in unserer modernen Gesellschaft ziemlich in den Hintergrund gerutscht und bei manchen Menschen sogar ganz verschwunden.
                          Auch die Unternehmenskultur in Deutschland lässt oft zu wünschen übrig. Eine Entwicklung, der wir entgegenstehen wollen. 


Uns sind Werte sehr wichtig. Deshalb achten wir nicht nur bei uns selbst sondern auch - so gut es überhaupt geht - bei unseren Herstellern
                          auf eine gute Unternehmenskultur und dass dort die transportierten Werte gelebt werden. Doch von welchen Werten sprechen wir hier: 
Es geht darum, dass wir Eigenschaften erfüllen wie Werthaltigkeit, wertvoll, Achtsamkeit mit Mensch, Tier und Natur leben, fair bleiben
                          gegenüber allen Beteiligten in der gesamten Kette und die Bewahrung von alten Traditionen, Herstellverfahren und Rezepten. 

                          Uns ist wichtig, dass der Hersteller gutes Geld verdient und nicht von Zweit- und Dritthändlern ausgenommen wird. Dass er eine reelle
                          Chance auf dem Internetmarkt hat und seine Produktion langfristig Erfolg hat. Es sollen auch durchaus Symbiosen zwischen den einzelnen
                          Herstellern entstehen, frei nach dem Motto: Gemeinsam sind wir stark! Überhaupt ist es eine wichtige Unternehmenskultur, die Vielfältigkeit
                          in gegenseitiger Unterstützung zu leben und nicht in Konkurrenz. 
Ein wichtiger Aspekt ist zudem die ""Rückführung"" der Menschen hin zum natürlichen Lebensmittel. Etwas Natürliches ist nicht unbegrenzt
                          haltbar, hat saisonale Zeiten, ist nicht immer das ganze Jahr verfügbar und schmeckt auch nicht immer gleich. Wer hier seine Geschmacksnerven
                          trainiert, wird langfristig ein richtiges Erleben beim Essen und Genießen haben, denn der Gaumen gewöhnt sich auch wieder an den natürlichen
                          Geschmack von unbehandelten und unveränderten Lebensmitteln. 
Der Mensch soll wieder Freude am Essen, am Kochen und Genießen haben!
                          
                          
                          Wir wollen für den Endkunden transparent bleiben. Der Kunde soll die Möglichkeit bekommen, bei einer Genussreise alle Manufakturen kennen
                          zu lernen. Die komplette Deklaration aller Inhaltsstoffe ist für uns selbstverständlich. 
Die Shops der Hersteller sind auch über unsere
                          GenussBoxX Seite zugänglich, damit sich der Kunde gerne weitere Produkte bei seinem Lieblingsanbieter bestellen kann.
                          
                          Wir wollen nicht mit knallharten Verträgen arbeiten, denn der Wert eines Handschlags bzw. einer mündlichen Vereinbarung soll wieder so
                          gelebt werden, wie vor der Zeit der modernen Kommunikations- und Rechtswelt. Ein für uns ganz wichtiger Wert! 
Menschlichkeit, Respekt
                          und Liebe unter den Menschen ist die Zukunft!

Let me finish on a few words about our values
Values have somehow become history in parts of modern society, and for some
people, they have disappeared completely. Corporate culture in Germany also
often leaves a lot to be desired. That’s a development we want to counter. 
Values are important for us. Therefore, we not only take care of them on our
end, but we also – as far as possible – make sure that our suppliers cherish a sound
corporate culture, meaning that they live in the spirit of their food. But
which values do we actually mean?
Our aim is that we cherish things
such as intrinsic value, attentiveness to humans, animals, and nature, fairness
against all involved in the entire chain of production and distribution,
clinging to traditions, manufacturing processes, and recipes. 
It is important that the
manufacturer earn good money for great work, and not be exploited by
in-betweeners; that he get a real chance at the internet market,
providing long-term success with his production. That may also include
that individual manufacturers start kinds of cooperation – for only together,
we are strong! And generally speaking, it is an important element of corporate
culture to live the great variety in mutual support, instead of bitter
competition. 
An important aspect
for us is also to “return” people to natural food. Of course, natural
food is not nonperishable, has its seasons, is not available throughout the
entire year, and does not always taste the same. Those who train their sense of
taste properly will – in the long run – make eating a real joy, as the
palate may also get reconditioned to the natural taste of organic and
unmodified food. 
People should rejoice in
eating, cooking, and enjoying food! Therefore, we want to be very
transparent for our customers. Our customers should get the chance of
getting to know all manufactories during a Genuss journey. It
goes without saying that we attach great importance on complete declarations of
all ingredients. 
The shops of our
manufacturers are also accessible via our GenussBoxX website, to enable our
customers to order further products directly from their favorite suppliers. We
don’t want to play hardball with contracts, but the value of a handshake and
an oral agreement has to come to life again, the way it was before the
new world of communication and legislation. That’s really an important value
for us. 
Humaneness, mutual respect, and love among people will
be the future!
Thanks for your support. Please select a sum and the respective perk for
you, and become part of the new movement in favor of regionally manufactured food
and delicacies. 
MAKE IT HAPPEN - NOW

</div></div>","Tecnología y Productos de México (TECNOPROMEX) Por el Momento es una Estación de Trabajo que Consiste en Dos equipos de Cómputo Casi Obsoletos, el Internet que Uso es del Vecino y Mi Oficina es Una construcción con el Techo Fracturado a Punto de Caer, No tiene Cimientos y el Techo lo Sostengo con Vigas de Madera; Yo Represento a TECNOPROMEX mi Sueño es Constituirla como Empresa
Mi Misión Por el Momento es Estructurar a mi Comercializadora con Equipo y en un Entorno Más Seguro, por eso Pido tu Ayuda, no Deseo nada Regalado Quiero Ganarlo
Estoy Ubicado en Calle Nayarit 77 Colonia Ricardo Flores Magón de la Ciudad de Cuernavaca, Morelos, México; Para Atención al Cliente de Cualquier parte del Mundo; Nuestro Teléfono 0527773670761 Aunque Prefiero el Contacto por Correo Electrónico:   tecnopromex@gmail.com


Mi Nombre es Jaime Emeterio Salgado, Nací el 11 de Octubre de 1959, en Tenanguillo de las Cañas, del Estado de Guerrero, México; Soy Fundador de TECNOPROMEX  que Recuerda por el Mimento es una Estación de Trabajo muy Sencilla
QUE OBJETIVOS SE LOGRARÁN CON ESTA CAMPAÑA:
1.- OFICINA Y EQUIPO: Por el Momento es Muy Importante Tener una Oficina Segura y Adquirir Equipo más Avanzado y Rápido para Desarrollar Mis Planes de Trabajo Bajo Presión.

2.- DEBO COMERCIALIZAR PRODUCTOS DIGITALIZADOS DESCARGABLES QUE  AYUDAN A MEJORAR LA CALIDAD DE VIDA DE LAS PERSONAS: Uno de los Productos a Desplazar es el Digital, Producto Descargable en la PC del Cliente en Forma de Información Estos: Son Libros Electrónicos Manuales y Guías Especializadas, Softwares o Programas Informáticos, Cursos de Capacitación, Cursos de Idiomas, Tutoriales Audiovisuales, Tratamientos Naturales y Mucho Más, Editados en Español Con avanzadas Técnicas Autodidactas para Descargar en la Computadora del Cliente y Promover su Aplicación, Formación, Capacitación en Casa:


3.- DEBO COMERCIALIZAR PRODUCTOS FÍSICOS DE ALTA CALIDAD: Son Aparatos electrónicos, Cámaras Digitales, Cámaras de Vídeo, Relojes de Pulso y Decorativos, Computadoras, Laptops, Tables, Equipo Periférico de computación, Equipos de Audio y Video, Telefonía Celular, Suplementos Alimenticios, Suplementos Vitamínicos y Más...



4.- OBTENDRÉ INGRESOS DE LA HERRAMIENTA GOOGLE ADSENSE:  Es una Herramienta Sencilla de Implementar, Consiste en Permitir que Google coloque Tres anuncios Publicitarios en Tu Sitio Web y los Visitantes de tu Sitio Algunos Harán Clic en los Anuncios de Google; Por Cada Clic Google Te Pagará Algunos Centavos de Dólar; A esa Estrategia Google le nombra ""Pago por Clic""; Yo Desarrollé Muestreos y Testeos Determinando que de 250 mil Visitas se Generan unos 2000 Clics en los Anuncios de Google traducido en Dinero Serán unos 150 Dólares...


Mi Proyecto Consiste en Generar una Plataforma De Sitios Específicos con Alto Valor en su Contenido, No Son Tiendas Virtuales, Son Sitios que Atraen Como Imán a los Visitantes, Estos Sitios Deberán Recibir Después de 4 Años de Trabajo unos 3.5 Millones de Visitas Mensuales Generando Ingresos Superiores a los 1800 Dólares Cada Mes de Manera Recurrente.

5.- MI COMERCIALIZADORA LLAMADA TECNOPROMEX DEBE CRECER Y DESARROLLARSE HASTA CONSTITUIRSE EN UNA EMPRESA: Como Negocio Debo Crecer al Grado de Constituirme como Empresa; Depende Mucho de los Ingresos; En México Cuando las Utilidades Brutas de una Persona Física superan los 75oo Dólares Mensuales, las Autoridades Hacendarias Hacen Presión para Constituirse Como empresa, este Objetivo de Ser Empresa Podemos Lograrlo 4 Años Después de Recibir el Apoyo Financiero de Crowdfunding.
ORGANIGRAMA DE  TECNOPROMEX PRIMER AÑO DE TRABAJO

ORGANIGRAMA DE TECNOPROMEX SEGUNDO Y TERCER AÑO DE TRABAJO

ORGANIGRAMA DE TECNOPROMEX CONSTITUIDO COMO EMPRESA CUATRO AÑOS DESPUÉS DE RECIBIR EL FINANCIAMIENTO DE CROWDFUNDING INDIEGOGO;  SU NUEVA DENOMINACIÓN SERÁ: 
Tecnología y Productos de México S.A, de C.V.

Con tu Apoyo Financiero Planeo Constituirme como Empresa en 4 Años a Partir de la Inyección de Capital; Entonces Daré Trabajo a 33 Personas en México y 5 o Más Comisionistas Extranjeros...
PRETENDO RECAUDAR CON TU AYUDA 32000 DÓLARES O MÁS, SERÁN APLICADOS PARA:
1.- Compra de Equipos de Cómputo de Alta Capacidad
2.- Compra de Cámaras Digitales de Alta Resolución y Equipos de Telefonía Celular
3.- Compra de Equipo de Audio y Video de Alta Resolución para Grabación de Video Cursos, Conferencias y Tutoriales AudioVisuales
4.- Compra de Proyectores y Equipo Periférico para Presentaciones Profesionales
5.- Equipo y Mobiliario de Oficina
6.- Compra de Existencias para Comercializarlas
7.- Pago de Nóminas Mientras la Comercializadora Despega
8.- Pago de Gastos Corrientes Mensuales Mientras la Comercializadora Despega
9.- Pago de Hosting, Dominios y Gastos Publicitarios
10:- Pagos de Gastos Publicitarios Recurrentes Mientras la Comercializadora Despega
RIESGOS Y OBSTÁCULOS: Claro que Existen Riesgos Durante el Desarrollo de mIs Trabajos, por Fortuna este Emprendimiento no Está Pensado de la Noche a la Mañana, Está Pensado desde Hace Varios Años, con el Respaldo de Cientos de Testeos de Prueba y Error; Cada Paso, Cada Estrategia, Cada Técnica que se Pretende Aplicar está Cuidadosamente Calculada en un Entorno Operativo Optimizado para Producir Ingresos, a Corto, a Mediano y a Largo Plazo; Ante este escenario los Riesgos y Obstáculos Están Minimizados...

</div></div>","Hi my name is Connie Beneteau and I am the coordinator of the RetroFest and Rock-Around the Clock festival in Chatham-Kent for the past 4 years. RetroFest has been thrilling families for 15 years and this is our ""Sweet Sixteen"" so we would like to 'pump it up' and we need your help to do that.

RetroFest started with only a few cars back in 2001 and now we have over 600 classic vehicles and over 30,000 visitors who come from around the region (London, Windsor, Sarnia) for this 2 day event. 
We are now getting requests to bring in more rides, more cars, and more entertainment. 
This is why we decided to launch this campaign. RetroFest is a free event offered to the public. We are asking you to partner with us in making this year special.

In all these years RetroFest has become a Cultural Landmark. 





Friday

amusement rides, 
vendors, 
live entertainment in the park
OLG classic cruise night

Saturday

activities in the park

   What We Need & What You Get

The annual budget is $25,000. We covered till now the entertainment, marketing and set up costs and we just need to cover licenses, community and event planning.The unique perk:


The festival became a cultural landmark in Chatham-Kent and the region and we are proud to say that we are having a positive impact on the community:
is the first festival of the season that welcomes 'Spring'

there is a full generation that grew up with our festival
brings families together for the week-end
develops hobbies and passion for classic cars
promotes healthy activities and competitions
adds to the community flavour

create the environment for community connections

<p>Amid the overfamiliar landscape of grocers, coffee shops and historic churches of Durham, NC, stands an enigmatic structure… a <i>house of conjure, </i>bearing the perplexing name of <i>Thaumaturgy 777</i>. <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">It’s proprietor is </span><i style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Magus</i><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">, a musician, poet, occultist and </span><i style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Conjure Coach</i><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">. He works with select, private clients to create strategic, innovative solutions to a variety of problems, both magickal and mundane. </span></p>
<p>Steeped in two decades of practice with the tarot, astrology and ritual, Magus uses a diversity of methods to peer onto the astral plane to gather information, identify objectives and manifest those goals on the material. Standing in the gap between the witch doctor and the life coach, <i>working at the crossroads where Hoodoo, Pagan and Ceremonial Magick meet</i>, Magus helps intrepid individuals to a deep place of understanding, with a new set of skills from which to draw.</p>
<p>Magus is an initiate of <i>The Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn,</i> a graduate of Catherine Yronwode’s <i>Hoodoo Rootwork Correspondence Course</i> and he’s versed in various other Pagan practices of spell work and divination. As a life coach, he is educated through Robbins-Madanes Training.</p>
<p>Established in 2010, Thaumaturgy 777 is an exclusive supply house of occult goods, offering up the finest in custom <i>materia magica, </i>those requisite articles of ritual magick... candles, books, powders, incenses, herbs, oils and curios. </p>

</li> <li>You get to be a very special part of this radical overhaul and you'll get some really exciting, exclusive stuff for yourself at the same time! </li> <li>Logically, the first concerns are always rent, bills and inventory. Beyond that, the financial contributions will go to the items that are needed most, in a sensible order. </li>
<li>If the goal is surpassed, then all additional funds will go to the next project, which is a Pagan community center, called Heka House, named after Hekate, the Goddess of witchcraft and <i>heka</i>, a term that means magick and the liminal spaces, between the worlds.

The vision is to turn this space into a place where various groups can meet and those in need can receive whatever immediate assistance we might be able to provide or point in the direction of. This might be as simple as sharing a hot meal or giving someone a ride to a doctor or the Food Bank. </li> </ul> </div> <div> <h3><br/></h3>
<h3>The Impact</h3> <ul>
<li>This is a small business in the truest sense of the word. It's a chance for you to be a champion for the little guy, helping many to experience some real magick, devoid of Hollywood froufrou and sensational commercialism.

There have been really good times and some exceedingly stressful times, even where it looked like I wouldn't make it at all, no matter what I did. Yet, the rough weather has been harbored and the future looks quite bright, indeed. There are lots of new things opening up right around the shop, such as Cocoa Cinnamon, a very popular coffee shop and Gregoria's Cuban Steakhouse is a fabulous eatery, right across the street.

After almost a year in that little space, Thaumaturgy 777 was upgraded (through some generous mojo from Jupiter) to a 3,600 square foot house on Hillsborough Rd in Durham. The shop is currently only two of those rooms but now there is a dedicated Temple space where I do private ritual and workings for patrons, there is a lab where the incenses, teas, bath mixes, oils, etc are mixed and a private office where I meet with patrons for conjure coaching. Additionally, I live in the building and there is a very large conference room where large workshops and group rituals are held. </li> </ul> </div> <div> <h3><br/></h3>

<li>Indiegogo says I should honestly assess the risks of this, since people appreciate transparency. I know that's true. So, here it is. Honestly, I have done everything the hard way, from day one. Part of that is a lack of business training; I went into this blind and taught myself all of it. Part of it is a thick-headed stubbornness that is both a blessing and a curse. My Cancer sun and Virgo ascendent means that it has to be my way and really, that is the only reason the products are as good as they are and the services are as solid as they are. Yet, I realize that any strength becomes a weakness, when taken too far. Yet, I am constantly reading, studying, asking questions and petitioning my Deities for aid.

He helped them despite only having bread yeast and lacking proper equipment. He did his best to teach the women basic fundamentals of the process but had neither the time or equipment to finish things before his term of service ended, in addition to this the little wine that was produced turned out terrible given the sensitivity of wine.</span><br/></p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;""><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Since the end of his service in early 2014, he began graduate school in the United States but remained dedicated to finishing the project with the women. During his first semester in 2014, he developed the project further and created a proposal for a class assignment. He then reached out to a colleague and a
community development professional and also an experienced home-brewer who
specializes in fruit wine to join him in carrying out the project properly. </span></span></p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;""><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Upon verifying over the phone that the women still wanted to produce wine, the three have began organizing everything to go down Chimente this summer. The three will travel to Guatemala and carry out this wine project to teach the women of Flor de Maria how to make wine over the course of three weeks. They will also set the women up with proper equipment for making and </span>bottling<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> the wine. </span></span></p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;""><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Through this project, the women will work with a distributor to sell the wine throughout the country and are estimated to be able to produce up to 300 bottles of win a year. These sales will increase their hourly income from $1 to $3 for time spent on production.</span></span><br/></p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>We need a total of $5,000 in order to cover transportation, room, and board costs associated with the trip.</p>

<span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">The Impact</span><br/>
</h3> <p>This project is extraordinarily important for female empowerment and community development. The additional knowledge, skills, and money will allow them to be able to help bring themselves, their families, and their community out of poverty. Currently these women hold multiple jobs, support their families and households.

</div></div>","Short Summary Josh Greenman, a Returned Peace Corps Volunteer was requested by a Mayan women's cooperative while serving in Guatemala to educate and train them how to make wine using local elderberries. He helped them despite only having bread yeast and lacking proper equipment. He did his best to teach the women basic fundamentals of the process but had neither the time or equipment to finish things before his term of service ended, in addition to this the little wine that was produced turned out terrible given the sensitivity of wine.
Since the end of his service in early 2014, he began graduate school in the United States but remained dedicated to finishing the project with the women. During his first semester in 2014, he developed the project further and created a proposal for a class assignment. He then reached out to a colleague and a
community development professional and also an experienced home-brewer who
specializes in fruit wine to join him in carrying out the project properly. 
Upon verifying over the phone that the women still wanted to produce wine, the three have began organizing everything to go down Chimente this summer. The three will travel to Guatemala and carry out this wine project to teach the women of Flor de Maria how to make wine over the course of three weeks. They will also set the women up with proper equipment for making and bottling the wine. 
Through this project, the women will work with a distributor to sell the wine throughout the country and are estimated to be able to produce up to 300 bottles of win a year. These sales will increase their hourly income from $1 to $3 for time spent on production.   What We Need & What You Get We need a total of $5,000 in order to cover transportation, room, and board costs associated with the trip.

Transportation (Flight/Car) for 3 round trip airfare tickets from Chicago to Guatemala City and transportation within the country - $2,500
Room & Board for 3 to cover hotel, food, and incidentals for 21 days- $2,000
Equipment - $500
We pay 18% in fees charged by Indiegogo - $900 if we reach our target 
Funds will still go towards these items even if the target is not reached.

If the target is reached, additional funding will go towards our 2nd trip down in 6 months where we teach the women how to bottle. 

An example of equipment is:
Camden tablets (for prepping the wine for fermentation)
Corker
Bottles
Hydrometer
Phosphates
Thermometer
PH meter
Hydrometer
Scales
Carboys
etc.

  
The Impact
 This project is extraordinarily important for female empowerment and community development. The additional knowledge, skills, and money will allow them to be able to help bring themselves, their families, and their community out of poverty. Currently these women hold multiple jobs, support their families and households. Since 2007 they have been producing jams and shampoos that are sold across Guatemala but the value earned from these items only makes them $1/hr and they only work 12 hours a week because of family and other responsibilities. With the incorporation of wine to their products sold, it is estimated that their hourly income will raise to $3/hr.
This project is wonderful because these women are the ones with the drive to produce wine and once it is done, the women will be self sufficient to continue making wine on their own. This women WANT to make wine to improve their livelihoods but need our help to learn how to do this.
Risks & Challenges
 We face very little obstacles outside of financial costs with this project since it is small scale and nothing is harmful in the wine making process. What this means is that even if the women do mess up in the process, the wine won't hurt anyone but will instead just taste bad. This means they will need to perfect the art to be more successful.
Aside from money, main challenge faced in this project is yeast. Currently the only yeast that can be found in Guatemala is bread yeast which ferments much faster and has a less pleasant flavor compared to regular brewing yeasts. One way we will try to get around this is by arranging an import service with the local Missionary Relief Aid store. We will attempt to persuade the store to import proper yeast for the women to purchase as it is needed. Once the process takes off though, we hope to travel down again with additional equipment to allow the cooperative to grow their own yeast from what is brought down.

History of X-Dom



We began in 2011 and it’s been a challenge everyday, since that very first idea of setting up something different.Our Team is composed mainly by Engineers from Naples. Currently we are involved in many projects, in the fields of electronics, informatics and automation engineering… and we’re planning to move towards new business areas.Aeromechs core business consists in the implementation of high-tech systems for “energy management” strategies, applied to different technological fields, such as aeronautics and domotics. Particularly, we’re involved in European and National projects referred to this topic.X-Dom is the first product of Aeromechs.
The X-Dom leverages the existing electrical connection, so
there are not necessary on-site works or alteration or purchase appliances
adapted to operate the system, since X-Dom adopts a data transmission technique
that eliminates the need for additional cabling .

We have already formed a truly awesome team, but we will have to bring in more team members to realize this dream. In fact, we are actively looking for new members to join X-dom and hit the ground running! Check out our website for more information.

<br/>Inti Eco
Lodge is an alternative to conventional tourism in Peru. We invite people to come and spend their stay
in this special place of learning and self-development.

<p>The aim is to create a community based
on self-sufficiency, where everyone can live healthy, learn how to live
sustainably, entertain, relax, heal, develop projects and express creativity.</p>
<p><b>The center will be 100% Eco Friendly!    </b>         <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1322926/files/20150324151132-Capture_d_e_cran_2015-03-24_a__23.05.29.png?1427235092"" src="""" style=""width: 136.636px; height: 136px;""/> <br/></p>
<p>Inti
Eco Lodge will propose various activities in areas dedicated to embrace people,
such as yoga, meditation, dance, and massages.</p>
<p>Other
spaces will be devoted to creativity development like painting, sculpting and
different workshops to discover natural medicine, cooking, diets, gardening and
how to grow your own fruits, vegetables and medicinal plants. <br/></p>
<p>The Center will
provide a natural swimming pool and guests will be invited to go fishing with
the locals. <br/></p>

interested people to reach a certain spiritual level during their ceremonies
but also for their diet and meditation period.</p>
<p>The price of your stay at the Lodge will vary depending on your accommodation, activities and
budget. Though, it will be very flexible and approachable, our purpose being to
attract people and make the lodge accessible for all. </p>
<p><b>Different sleeping options will be available</b>: a dormitory (with beds or

<p><b>WHO WE ARE?</b></p>
<p></p>I am Anne, I
arrived in Peru 3 years ago when I was 25 years old. 

<p>Since childhood I was fascinated by South America and the
Amazon.So, after my studies of International Business
in Paris and International Tourism in Australia, I decided to
create my own travel agency in Peru oriented toward ecotourism.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1323191/files/20150324163515-Anne.JPG?1427240115"" src="""" style=""width: 574.495px; height: 303px;""/></p>
<br/>
<p>I took some
time out from working on my projects to travel to Iquitos in the Peruvian
Amazon. I wanted to learn more about Shamanism and medicinal plants in order to assess their
effectiveness to cure my depression. </p>
<p>I spent five weeks in the
jungle with a
Shaman learning plant medicine and ultimately, learning about myself.This healed me and set me on the
path I am on today.This experience inspired me to create a centre to help
people. </p>
<p>In
December 2013, I returned to France to meet my french friend Marion, who I met
while studying in Australia,
where she was graduating in Interior Architecture. She was soon attending the
Earthship Biotecture Academy Program in New Mexico. As I wanted to make my lodge eco
focused, it was a great opportunity for both of us to then work together. She
joined my project and we started to implement the Earthship construction
principles: solar &amp; wind electricity, contained sewage treatment,
built with natural &amp; recycled materials, water harvesting, food production. <br/></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>                  <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1323222/files/20150324164546-Capture_d_cran_2015-03-25___00.43.22.png?1427240746"" src="""" style=""width: 447.38px; height: 356px;""/></p>
<br/><b>Returning to
Peru, I bought a land in Iquitos to start The Inti Eco Lodge. So far we have been building and
developing the land with locals
and international volunteers. </b>
<p><b><br/></b></p>
<p><b>TOTALLY OFF THE GRID
CONSTRUCTION</b></p>
<p>Inti Eco
Lodge is made out of wood taken from the trees of the land, each one is
replaced immediately. </p>
<p>We use recycled materials found
in Iquitos and its surroundings. Rain water is treated and used repeatedly and
solar energy will provide electricity (photovoltaics). We will build a
greenhouse and outdoor space permaculture productive all year. We will set up
an evacuation system (sewage) that do not pollute the earth or the surrounding
rivers and allow watering outdoor planting fruits and vegetables.</p>
<p>             <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1344346/files/20150331203525-earthship_system.jpg?1427859325"" src="""" style=""width: 524.107px; height: 317px;""/></p>
<br/>
<p>Thus, the <b>""black water""</b>
of kitchen sinks (containing solids) will go directly to the septic tank where
it is treated and then feed the outdoor botanical cell. On the other hand,
<b>""grey water""</b> (water
used once) from shower and sink in the bathroom will fuel the growing of fruits
and vegetables from the greenhouse. </p>
<p><span>A natural pool</span> will <span>operate through a system of pumps and two pools, one for swimming and one purifying
the water by the mineralization of organic matter by aquatic plants.</span></p>
<p><b><br/></b></p>
<p><b>GREENHOUSE/
AQUAPONICS/ PERMACULTURE<br/></b><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1340511/files/20150330191548-Capture_d_e_cran_2015-03-31_a__04.15.03.png?1427768148"" src="""" style=""width: 392.592px; height: 271px;""/><b></b></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>We
will build a greenhouse suitable for equatorial climate of the Peruvian Amazon
that will produce fruits and vegetables and fish throughout the year. Its
construction will comply with the three principles of sustainable design:
</p>
<p><b>- Earthship,
100% sustainable self-sufficient housing.</b></p>
<b>
</b><p><b>-
Aquaponics, cultivation
of plants in ""symbiosis"" with fish farming .</b></p>
<b>
</b><p><b>- Passive
solar greenhouse, absorbing the sun to maximize heat and solar gain.</b></p>
<p>We will apply a
fundamental concept from Earthship: ""the grey water"" from showers and
sinks, once purified, will be reused watering our crops in the greenhouse. This
water recycling system allows not only to save resources, protect the
environment, but also to produce a healthy diet. After a few years, its
production will prove to be profitable both by the quality and by the variety
and will allow to be independent. <br/><br/></p>

<p><br/></p>
<p>With the help
and knowledge of neighboring communities we will
use the land for <b>permaculture and growth of medicinal plants</b>. 

</p>
<p><span>The compost</span> <span>we made allows the
fermentation of organic products
which is then incorporated to the soil
to enrich.</span></p>
<p><b><br/></b></p>
<p><b>PLANTS AND SHAMANISM</b></p>
<p>Indigenous Cultures of the Amazon have
developed an extraordinary knowledge about the healing properties of medicinal
plants, especially those for its purgative, healing and visionary effects were
called ""Master Plants"" such as Ayahuasca, Tobacco, Shiric Sanango,
Toë, Ajo Sacha, Oje, San Pedro… </p>
<p><b><i>The mystery is out of 80, 000 plant species in the Amazon
how the shamans discovered the medicinal use of these plant combinations. </i></b></p>
<p>It is their belief that if they fulfill
certain conditions of isolation and follow a prescribed diet these plants are able to ""teach"" them<span>  how to diagnose and cure illnesses, how to
perform other shamanic tasks (prophecy, telepathy, cleansing, healing) and how
to use medicinal plants, usually through melodies or icaros. <br/></span></p>
<p><span><br/></span></p>
<p><span></span></p>
<p>                                 <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1323257/files/20150324165926-Capture_d_cran_2015-03-25___00.56.01.png?1427241566"" src="""" style=""width: 335.939px; height: 251px;""/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p>Iquitos is one the most famous places
where you can find and make use of the shamanic plants with practitioners,
shamans or curanderos. The reasons
vary but there are some common themes. One is the need to reconnect with the
archaic past, a desire for continuity with the consciousness of ancient times.
There is also a desire to be more connected with nature, not as destructive to
the planet and reintroduce the sacred in their lives.</p>
<p>For people interested in ancestral use in
traditional rituals, guaranteeing cultural continuity and its therapeutic
virtues, at Inti Eco Lodge, we will offer ceremonies and diets with our
shamans/curanderos. <br/></p>

<p>We are building the center with the help of volunteers from all over the world. It's a great experience to gather
people from different backgrounds, ages and professions but
all sharing the same interest. Some have no knowledge about construction
but just the will to learn and others have experience and skills in
construction, architecture, biotecture or permaculture. There is no requirement

We want to think collectively and gather ideas in order to find the best
adapted and sustainable solutions.<span>  </span>
<p><b>Together</b><b>, </b><b>we can bring this project to life</b><b>! </b></p>

<p><b>RELATIONSHIP WITH NEIGHBORING
COMMUNITIES</b></p>
<p><b>The profits will
allow to improve the lodge and assist the neighboring communities, but will
also go to reforestation, NGOs and Peruvian tribes.<span>  </span></b></p>
<p>We currently exchange ideas with our communities on how to build in a
more sustainable way and how to live sustainably, to share
knowledge for the best.</p>

<p>We
also talk about teaching alternatives to the usual evacuation of water polluting
the land and the Amazon River by opting for composting toilets for example, or
how to contain, treat and distribute wastewater.</p>
<p><b>With these communities we share water and plantcare technics promoting mutual aid.
Providing work and food</b>, we mix our
communities because we have so much to learn from each other. We are not trying to invade their
land and industrialize them, instead, we want to reconnect with nature and all
it has to offer.</p>

<p><b>QUI SOMMES NOUS?</b></p>
<p>Je m'appelle Anne, je suis
arrivée au Pérou il y a 3 ans, quand j'avais 25 ans. Déjà toute petite j'étais
fascinée par l'Amérique Latine et l'Amazonie. Après mes études de commerce
international à Paris puis de tourisme international en Australie, j'ai décidé de créer ma propre
agence de tourisme orientée vers l'écotourisme, au Pérou.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1323194/files/20150324163622-Anne.JPG?1427240182"" src="""" style=""width: 566.911px; height: 299px;""/></p>
<br/>
<p>L’idée d’Inti Eco Lodge est
venue d’une expérience vécue à Iquitos en Amazonie péruvienne. Je m’y suis
rendu pour apprendre sur les plantes médicinales et le chamanisme afin de juger
de leur efficacité à soigner ma dépression. J’ai séjourné dans la jungle
pendant 5 semaines avec un chaman/curandero, à travailler sur des diètes et
certaines plantes. Cette expérience m’a guéri et m’a donné l’envie de créer un
centre pour aider les autres. </p>
<p>En Décembre 2013, je suis
rentrée en France où j'ai retrouvé mon amie française Marion. Je l’avais
rencontrée en Australie, dans notre université où elle étudiait l’architecture
d’intérieur. Elle partait pour le Nouveau Mexique suivre le programme
académique Earthship Biotecture. Comme je voulais que mon Lodge soit
écologique, c'était une très bonne opportunité pour nous deux de travailler
ensemble par la suite. </p>
<p>Elle a donc intégré mon
projet en mettant en application les principes de construction Earthship:
électricité solaire et éolienne, traitement des eaux usées, utilisation de
matériaux recyclés et naturels, récupération de l'eau, production alimentaire. <br/></p>
<p></p>
<p>                   <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1323232/files/20150324164916-Capture_d_cran_2015-03-25___00.43.22.png?1427240956"" src="""" style=""width: 425.17px; height: 339px;""/></p>
<br/>
<p>De retour au Pérou, j'ai
acheté un terrain à Iquitos pour lancer Inti Eco Lodge. </p>
<p><b>Nous avons commencé le
projet de construction en Novembre 2014 et depuis nous avons réalisé plusieurs
constructions et améliorons constamment l’état du terrain avec l’aide de locaux
et de bénévoles internationaux.</b></p>
<b>
</b><p><b><br/></b></p>
<p><b>CONSTRUCTION ECO RESPONSABLE</b></p>
<p>Inti
Eco Lodge sera construit avec les arbres de la forêt qui seront remplacés
immédiatement. Nous utilisons des matériaux recyclés trouvés à Iquitos et ses
environs. L'eau de pluie est traitée et utilisée à plusieurs reprises et
l'énergie solaire fournira l'électricité (photovoltaïque). </p>
<p>Une serre et un espace de permaculture seront
productifs toute l'année. Nous mettrons en place un système d'évacuation des
eaux usées (égouts) qui ne polluera ni la terre, ni les rivières environnantes,
et permettra l'arrosage d'une des plantations extérieures de fruits et légumes. <br/></p>
<p></p>
<p>          <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1344348/files/20150331203638-earthship_system.jpg?1427859398"" src="""" style=""width: 542.293px; height: 328px;""/></p>Ainsi, <b>""l'eau
noire""</b> des éviers de cuisine (contenant des matières solides) ira
directement à la fosse septique où elle sera traitée pour ensuite alimenter la
cellule botanique extérieure. 
<p>En revanche, <b>""l'eau grise""</b> des douches
et éviers de la salle de bain ira alimenter la culture de fruits et légumes de
la serre.</p>
<p>Une
piscine naturelle fonctionnera<span>  grâce à
un système de pompes et de deux bassins, un pour la baignade et l’autre qui se
chargera d’épurer l’eau par la minéralisation de la matière organique par les
plantes aquatiques. </span></p>

<p><b>SERRE/ AQUAPONIE/
PERMACULTURE <br/></b></p>

<br/>
<p>Nous allons construire une
serre adaptée au climat équatorial de l'Amazonie péruvienne qui produira des
fruits et légumes et du poisson tout au long de l'année. Sa construction
respectera les trois principes de conception durable: </p>
<p><b>- Earthship, habitation 100%
autosuffisante et durable.</b></p>
<b>
</b><p><b>- Aquaponie, culture de
végétaux en ""symbiose"" avec l'élevage de poissons.</b></p>
<b>
</b><p><b>- Serre solaire passive,
absorbant le soleil pour maximiser la chaleur et le gain solaire.</b></p>
<b>
</b><p>Nous appliquerons un concept fondamental de Earthship : ""l'eau
grise"" des douches et lavabos, une fois purifiée, resservira à l'arrosage
de nos cultures dans la serre.<br/>
Le système de recyclage des eaux permet, non seulement d’économiser des
ressources mais aussi de produire une alimentation plus saine tout en préservant
l’environnement.</p>
<p>Après quelques années, sa production s’avérera être bénéfique
tant par sa variété que par sa qualité et permettra aussi au lodge d’être plus indépendant.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1344327/files/20150331201310-grenhousefrancais.gif?1427857990"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/>
<p>Avec l'aide et la connaissance
des communautés voisines, nous utiliserons la terre et le compost pour la
<b>permaculture et la croissance des plantes médicinales</b>. </p>
<p><br/>
Le compost que nous avons fait permet la fermentation des produits organiques
qui est ensuite incorporé aux terres agricoles afin de les enrichir. </p>
<p><b><br/></b></p>
<p><b>PLANTES AND CHAMANISME</b></p>
<p>Les Cultures Indigènes de l'Amazonie ont développées une
connaissance extraordinaire des propriétés curatives des plantes médicinales,
en particulier pour ses effets purgatifs, de guérison et visionnaires. Ces
plantes sont appelées « Plantes Maîtresses » comme l'Ayahuasca, Tabac, Shiric
Sanango, Toë, Ajo Sacha, Oje, San Pedro ...</p>
<p><b><i>Le mystère est que sur 80 000 espèces de plantes en
Amazonie, comment les chamans ont-ils pu découvrir les combinaisons de
celles-ci pour une utilisation médicinale? </i></b></p>
<p>Ils croient que s'ils remplissent certaines conditions
d'isolement et suivent un régime alimentaire prescrit, ces plantes sont
capables de leur « enseigner » comment diagnostiquer et guérir les maladies,
comment effectuer d'autres tâches chamaniques (prophétie, télépathie, nettoyage
interne) et comment utiliser les plantes médicinales à travers des chants
appelés Icaros.</p>
<p></p>
<p>                                     <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1323259/files/20150324170028-Capture_d_cran_2015-03-25___00.56.01.png?1427241628"" src="""" style=""width: 326.629px; height: 244px;""/></p>
<br/>
<p>Iquitos est un des lieux les
plus célèbres où vous pouvez trouver et utiliser les plantes maîtresses avec
des chamans/curanderos. Les raisons varient, mais les thèmes sont souvent
communs. Cela va de la nécessité de renouer avec le passé archaïque, au désir
de continuité avec la conscience de l'Antiquité ou encore le désir d'être plus
connecté avec la nature et le monde spirituel.</p>
<p><br/>
Pour les personnes intéressées, nous proposons des cérémonies et des retraites
avec des chamanes à travers l’utilisation de plantes pour connaître et
transmettre leurs vertus thérapeutiques.</p>

eaux, polluant les terres et le fleuve Amazone, en optant par exemple pour des
toilettes sèches puis leur montrer comment endiguer, traiter et distribuer les

<p><b>SOBRE NOSOTROS</b></p>
<p>Soy Anne, llegué a Perú hace tres
años, cuando yo tenía 25 años. Desde que era muy joven siempre he estado
fascinada por América del Sur y de la Amazonía, así que después de mis estudios
de negocios internacionales en París y luego de turismo internacional en
Australia.llegué a Perú para iniciar mi propia
agencia de viajes con eco-tours.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1323199/files/20150324163722-Anne.JPG?1427240242"" src="""" style=""width: 561.223px; height: 296px;""/></p>
<br/><p> La idea de Inti Eco Lodge venía de una
experiencia en Iquitos, en la Amazonía peruana. Fui allí para aprender sobre
las plantas medicinales y el chamanismo para juzgar su eficacia para tratar mi
depresión. Yo estaba en la selva durante 5 semanas con un chamán / curandero, haciendo
dietas de plantas. Esta experiencia me hizo bien y me dieron ganas de crear un
centro para ayudar a otros. 
</p>
<p>En diciembre de 2013, volví a
Francia para encontrar a mi amiga Marion, una amiga de Australia. Ella me dijo
que iba a Nuevo México para ir a la Academia de Earthship y como yo quería
hacer mi Eco Lodge, pensé que sería genial si pudiéramos usar mi centro en uno
de sus proyectos.</p>
<p>Así que ella está en mi proyecto, en
la implementación de los principios de Earthship construcción: energía solar y
eólica, tratamiento de aguas residuales, el uso de materiales reciclados y
naturales, la captación de agua, la producción de alimentos.</p>
<p></p>
<p>                      <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1323233/files/20150324164957-Capture_d_cran_2015-03-25___00.43.22.png?1427240997"" src="""" style=""width: 430.338px; height: 343px;""/></p>
<br/>
<p>Regresé al Perú, y me compré un
terreno en Iquitos para lanzar Inti Eco Lodge. Empezamos el proyecto de
construcción en noviembre de 2014 y desde entonces, hemos hecho varios
edificios y tratamos de mejorar constantemente la condición del lugar con la
ayuda de voluntarios locales e internacionales.</p>
<p><b><br/></b></p>
<p><b>CONSTRUCCION ECO RESPONSABLE</b></p>
<p> Inti Eco Lodge se construirá
con los árboles del terreno y serán reemplazados inmediatamente. Utilizamos
materiales reciclados que se encuentran en Iquitos y sus alrededores. De hecho,
se tratará el agua de lluvia y utilizara en varias ocasiones, la energía solar
proporcionará la electricidad (fotovoltaica). </p>
<p>Un invernadero y un espacio para la
permacultura serán productivos durante todo el año. También vamos a poner en
marcha un sistema de eliminación de aguas residuales (alcantarillado), que no
contaminan ni la tierra, ni los ríos y que permitirá el riego de los huertos
como frutas y verduras. </p>
<p></p>
<p>            <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1344350/files/20150331203734-earthship_system.jpg?1427859454"" src="""" style=""width: 520.8px; height: 315px;""/></p>
<br/>
<p>Por lo tanto, el<b> ""agua negra""</b> de fregaderos
de cocina (que contiene los residuos sólidos) irá directamente a la fosa
séptica, donde será procesada para luego alimentar la célula botánica exterior. <br/></p>
<p>Por el contrario, el <b>""agua gris""</b> (usada una vez) de las duchas y
lavabos regará los huertos de frutas y verduras del invernadero.</p>
<p>La piscina natural funcionará
mediante un sistema de bombas y dos piscinas, una para nadar y uno que
purificar el agua para la mineralización de la materia orgánica de las plantas
acuáticas.</p>
<p><b><br/></b></p>
<p><b>INVERNADERO / AQUAPONICS / PERMACULTURE</b></p>
<p><b></b></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1340526/files/20150330191916-Capture_d_e_cran_2015-03-31_a__04.15.03.png?1427768356"" src="""" style=""width: 378.489px; height: 261px;""/></p>Vamos a construir un invernadero
conveniente para el clima ecuatorial de la Amazonía peruana que producirá
frutas y verduras y el pescado durante todo el año.

<p>Su construcción se cumplirá con los
tres principios de diseño sostenible:</p>
<p><b>- Earthship, vivienda sostenible
100% autosuficiente.</b></p>
<b>
</b><p><b>- Aquaponics, sistema simbiótico con
peces y plantas para cultivar alimentos.</b></p>
<b>
</b><p><b>- Invernadero solar pasivo,
absorbiendo el sol para maximizar la ganancia de calor solar.</b></p>
<p>Vamos a aplicar un concepto
fundamental de Earthship, las ""aguas grises"" de duchas y lavabos, una
vez purificadas, regara nuestros cultivos en invernaderos. El sistema de
reciclaje de agua permite no sólo ahorrar recursos, sino también para la
producción de alimentos más sanos y preservar el medio ambiente. Después de
unos años, su producción será beneficiosa tanto por su variedad como por su
calidad y será independiente. <br/></p>

<br/><p>Con la ayuda de las comunidades, vamos a utilizar
el suelo y fertilizante para la permacultura y el crecimiento de las plantas
medicinales. <br/>
El compuesto que nos permite que la fermentación de productos orgánicos se
incorpore en tierras agrícolas para enriquecerlas.</p>
<p><b><br/></b></p>
<p><b>PLANTAS Y SHAMANISMO</b></p>
<p>Culturas Indígenas han desarrollado
un extraordinario conocimiento sobre las propiedades curativas de las plantas
medicinales, especialmente las purgativas, la curación y efectos visionarios
fueron llamados ""plantas maestros"", como Ayahuasca, Tabaco, sanango
Shiric, dedo del pie, Ajo Sacha, Oje, San Pedro ...</p>
<p><b>El misterio es de 80, 000 especies
de plantas en la Amazonía como chamanes descubrieron el uso medicinal de estas
combinaciones de plantas. </b></p>
<p>Es su creencia, si cumplen ciertas
condiciones de aislamiento y siguen una dieta stricta, estas plantas son
capaces de ""enseñar"" a ellos para diagnosticar y curar enfermedades,
para realizar otras tareas chamánicas (profecía, la telepatía, la limpieza, la
curación) y cómo utilizar plantas medicinales, por lo general con melodías o
icaros.</p>
<p></p>

<br/><p> Iquitos es uno de los lugares más famosos donde se puede utilizar
plantas chamánicas con los profesionales, los chamanes o curanderos. Las
razones varían, pero hay algunos temas comunes. Una de ellas es la necesidad de
volver a conectar con el pasado antiguo, el deseo de continuar con el
conocimiento de la antigüedad o el deseo de estar más conectados con la
naturaleza y el mundo de los espíritus.</p>
<p>Para los interesados, ofrecemos
dietas y ceremonias con nuestros curanderos a través del uso de plantas para
entender y comunicar sus propiedades terapéuticas.</p>

Welcome
to Inti Eco Lodge Crowdfunding PHASE 1.




“We have the absolute certainty that it is possible to
find a peaceful country united around a new collaborative project focused on
the future, modernity, well-being and respect for each other, in close
cooperation with the rest of the world” said Nicolas Hulot, the French
journalist-reporter committed in protecting and raising public
awareness on the ecologic matters.  
In this project, we want to move forward and create
new sustainable life models adapted to our environment and resources.  We would like to reach a perfect match
between living in nature, be self sufficient, in an unusual habitat, while
revitalizing mind and body.
Inti
Eco Lodge is the first Lodge using Earthship Biotecture's concepts in Peru and
in The Amazon.


Through
this place, we share and sensibilize not only our guests but also local
communities and volunteers, around sustainable development, growing local and
healthy food, well being and spiritual opening. 
Our
main goal is to create a unique place of living and an authentic experience, in
a non-profit Center of well-being in the heart of the Peruvian Amazon.

THE PROJECT 

Inti Eco
Lodge is an alternative to conventional tourism in Peru. We invite people to come and spend their stay
in this special place of learning and self-development.

The aim is to create a community based
on self-sufficiency, where everyone can live healthy, learn how to live
sustainably, entertain, relax, heal, develop projects and express creativity.
The center will be 100% Eco Friendly!              
Inti
Eco Lodge will propose various activities in areas dedicated to embrace people,
such as yoga, meditation, dance, and massages.
Other
spaces will be devoted to creativity development like painting, sculpting and
different workshops to discover natural medicine, cooking, diets, gardening and
how to grow your own fruits, vegetables and medicinal plants. 
The Center will
provide a natural swimming pool and guests will be invited to go fishing with
the locals. 


The Maloca
(sacred place) will be dedicated to Shamanic ceremonies in order to allow
interested people to reach a certain spiritual level during their ceremonies
but also for their diet and meditation period.
The price of your stay at the Lodge will vary depending on your accommodation, activities and
budget. Though, it will be very flexible and approachable, our purpose being to
attract people and make the lodge accessible for all. 
Different sleeping options will be available: a dormitory (with beds or
hammock spots), basic bungalows (one queen size bed or twin beds with private
toilet and shared bathroom), superior bungalows (one queen bed or twin beds
with private toilet and bathroom) and luxury treehouses. 

                           

                            
We assure you
that we are going to make our experience one for all travellers, holiday makers
and soul searchers.As the Lodge is non profit the benefits will go towards NGO’s,
reforestation, animal welfare, Peruvian tribes, neighboring communities, the
employees and to improving and maintaining the lodge. 

WHO WE ARE?
I am Anne, I
arrived in Peru 3 years ago when I was 25 years old. 

Since childhood I was fascinated by South America and the
Amazon.So, after my studies of International Business
in Paris and International Tourism in Australia, I decided to
create my own travel agency in Peru oriented toward ecotourism.



I took some
time out from working on my projects to travel to Iquitos in the Peruvian
Amazon. I wanted to learn more about Shamanism and medicinal plants in order to assess their
effectiveness to cure my depression. 
I spent five weeks in the
jungle with a
Shaman learning plant medicine and ultimately, learning about myself.This healed me and set me on the
path I am on today.This experience inspired me to create a centre to help
people. 
In
December 2013, I returned to France to meet my french friend Marion, who I met
while studying in Australia,
where she was graduating in Interior Architecture. She was soon attending the
Earthship Biotecture Academy Program in New Mexico. As I wanted to make my lodge eco
focused, it was a great opportunity for both of us to then work together. She
joined my project and we started to implement the Earthship construction
principles: solar & wind electricity, contained sewage treatment,
built with natural & recycled materials, water harvesting, food production. 


                  
Returning to
Peru, I bought a land in Iquitos to start The Inti Eco Lodge. So far we have been building and
developing the land with locals
and international volunteers. 

TOTALLY OFF THE GRID
CONSTRUCTION
Inti Eco
Lodge is made out of wood taken from the trees of the land, each one is
replaced immediately. 
We use recycled materials found
in Iquitos and its surroundings. Rain water is treated and used repeatedly and
solar energy will provide electricity (photovoltaics). We will build a
greenhouse and outdoor space permaculture productive all year. We will set up
an evacuation system (sewage) that do not pollute the earth or the surrounding
rivers and allow watering outdoor planting fruits and vegetables.
             

Thus, the ""black water""
of kitchen sinks (containing solids) will go directly to the septic tank where
it is treated and then feed the outdoor botanical cell. On the other hand,
""grey water"" (water
used once) from shower and sink in the bathroom will fuel the growing of fruits
and vegetables from the greenhouse. 
A natural pool will operate through a system of pumps and two pools, one for swimming and one purifying
the water by the mineralization of organic matter by aquatic plants.

GREENHOUSE/
AQUAPONICS/ PERMACULTURE

We
will build a greenhouse suitable for equatorial climate of the Peruvian Amazon
that will produce fruits and vegetables and fish throughout the year. Its
construction will comply with the three principles of sustainable design:

- Earthship,
100% sustainable self-sufficient housing.

-
Aquaponics, cultivation
of plants in ""symbiosis"" with fish farming .

- Passive
solar greenhouse, absorbing the sun to maximize heat and solar gain.
We will apply a
fundamental concept from Earthship: ""the grey water"" from showers and
sinks, once purified, will be reused watering our crops in the greenhouse. This
water recycling system allows not only to save resources, protect the
environment, but also to produce a healthy diet. After a few years, its
production will prove to be profitable both by the quality and by the variety
and will allow to be independent. 


With the help
and knowledge of neighboring communities we will
use the land for permaculture and growth of medicinal plants. 


The compost we made allows the
fermentation of organic products
which is then incorporated to the soil
to enrich.

PLANTS AND SHAMANISM
Indigenous Cultures of the Amazon have
developed an extraordinary knowledge about the healing properties of medicinal
plants, especially those for its purgative, healing and visionary effects were
called ""Master Plants"" such as Ayahuasca, Tobacco, Shiric Sanango,
Toë, Ajo Sacha, Oje, San Pedro… 
The mystery is out of 80, 000 plant species in the Amazon
how the shamans discovered the medicinal use of these plant combinations. 
It is their belief that if they fulfill
certain conditions of isolation and follow a prescribed diet these plants are able to ""teach"" them  how to diagnose and cure illnesses, how to
perform other shamanic tasks (prophecy, telepathy, cleansing, healing) and how
to use medicinal plants, usually through melodies or icaros. 


                                 


Iquitos is one the most famous places
where you can find and make use of the shamanic plants with practitioners,
shamans or curanderos. The reasons
vary but there are some common themes. One is the need to reconnect with the
archaic past, a desire for continuity with the consciousness of ancient times.
There is also a desire to be more connected with nature, not as destructive to
the planet and reintroduce the sacred in their lives.
For people interested in ancestral use in
traditional rituals, guaranteeing cultural continuity and its therapeutic
virtues, at Inti Eco Lodge, we will offer ceremonies and diets with our
shamans/curanderos. 

                       

VOLUNTEERING AND
TOURISM
We are building the center with the help of volunteers from all over the world. It's a great experience to gather
people from different backgrounds, ages and professions but
all sharing the same interest. Some have no knowledge about construction
but just the will to learn and others have experience and skills in
construction, architecture, biotecture or permaculture. There is no requirement
to join us.

                     
                    
                      

We want to think collectively and gather ideas in order to find the best
adapted and sustainable solutions.  
Together, we can bring this project to life! 

RELATIONSHIP WITH NEIGHBORING
COMMUNITIES
The profits will
allow to improve the lodge and assist the neighboring communities, but will
also go to reforestation, NGOs and Peruvian tribes.  
We currently exchange ideas with our communities on how to build in a
more sustainable way and how to live sustainably, to share
knowledge for the best.

                        

We
also talk about teaching alternatives to the usual evacuation of water polluting
the land and the Amazon River by opting for composting toilets for example, or
how to contain, treat and distribute wastewater.
With these communities we share water and plantcare technics promoting mutual aid.
Providing work and food, we mix our
communities because we have so much to learn from each other. We are not trying to invade their
land and industrialize them, instead, we want to reconnect with nature and all
it has to offer.

En Français:
Bienvenue dans la Phase n°1 de notre campagne de
fonds Inti Eco Lodge!
“Nous avons l’absolue certitude qu’il est possible
de retrouver un pays apaisé et uni autour d’un nouveau projet collectif tourné
vers l’avenir, la modernité, le bien-être et le respect de l’autre, en
coopération étroite avec le reste du monde” affirme Nicolas Hulot le
journaliste-reporter français engagé dans la protection et sensibilisation du
public sur les questions écologiques.
À travers ce projet, nous voulons promouvoir et créer de
nouveaux modèles de vie durables adaptés à nos ressources et à notre
environnement. Nous aimerions atteindre une parfaite adéquation entre vivre en
pleine nature, dans un habitat inhabituel, être respectueux de l'environnement,
tout en revitalisant son corps et son esprit.
Inti
Eco Lodge sera le premier Lodge écologique à utiliser les concepts de Earthship
(habitations écologiques et autosuffisantes) au Pérou et en Amazonie.
Nous partageons et
sensibilisons nos seulement nos clients mais aussi nos communautés voisines et
nos volontaires autour du développement durable, de la culture de produits bio
et locaux, du bien être et de la spiritualité. 
Notre objectif principal est
de créer un lieu unique et une expérience authentique, dans un centre de
bien-être à but non lucratif au coeur de l'Amazonie péruvienne.

LE PROJET



Inti Eco Lodge est une
alternative au tourisme classique. Nous invitons les gens à venir passer leur
séjour dans cet endroit d'apprentissage et le développement de soi. 
L'objectif est de créer une
communauté basée sur l'autosuffisance, où chacun peut apprendre à vivre en bonne
santé, à vivre durablement, se divertir, se détendre, se guérir,
développer des projets et exprimer sa créativité.  
Le centre sera 100% Eco Friendly!                         
Inti
Eco Lodge proposera diverses activités dédiées au bien être et à
l'épanouissement de chacun telles que le yoga, la méditation, la danse et les
massages.
D'autres zones seront consacrées au développement de la créativité telles que la
peinture et sculpture, à des ateliers de découverte de la médecine naturelle,
de cuisine, de jardinage, ou comment cultiver vos propres fruits, légumes et
plantes médicinales. Le Centre sera pourvu d'une piscine naturelle et
les invités pourront pêcher avec les locaux. 

La
Maloca (lieu sacré) sera dédiée aux cérémonies chamaniques, aux diètes et à la
méditation afin de permettre aux personnes intéressées d'atteindre un certain
niveau spirituel.Les tarifs de votre séjour dépendront de
l'hébergement, des activités et du budget
de chacun, afin de rendre le lodge accessible à tous! 

Plusieurs options d’hébergement seront disponibles: un dortoir (avec des lits
et un espace pour hamac), des bungalows basiques (avec un lit double ou deux
lits jumeaux , des toilettes et une salle de bain public), ou supérieurs (toilettes
et salle de bain privée) et des cabanes luxueuses dans les arbres.

                            
                             
Nous
assurons une expérience unique pour tous les voyageurs, vacanciers ou personnes
en quête de soi.Le Lodge étant à but non
lucratif, les bénéfices seront versés à des ONG, à la reforestation, aux
communautés avoisinantes, aux employés, à la protection des tribus péruviennes
et à la faune et la flore.
Une partie des bénéfices
servira également à l'amélioration et l'entretien du lodge.

QUI SOMMES NOUS?
Je m'appelle Anne, je suis
arrivée au Pérou il y a 3 ans, quand j'avais 25 ans. Déjà toute petite j'étais
fascinée par l'Amérique Latine et l'Amazonie. Après mes études de commerce
international à Paris puis de tourisme international en Australie, j'ai décidé de créer ma propre
agence de tourisme orientée vers l'écotourisme, au Pérou.



L’idée d’Inti Eco Lodge est
venue d’une expérience vécue à Iquitos en Amazonie péruvienne. Je m’y suis
rendu pour apprendre sur les plantes médicinales et le chamanisme afin de juger
de leur efficacité à soigner ma dépression. J’ai séjourné dans la jungle
pendant 5 semaines avec un chaman/curandero, à travailler sur des diètes et
certaines plantes. Cette expérience m’a guéri et m’a donné l’envie de créer un
centre pour aider les autres. 
En Décembre 2013, je suis
rentrée en France où j'ai retrouvé mon amie française Marion. Je l’avais
rencontrée en Australie, dans notre université où elle étudiait l’architecture
d’intérieur. Elle partait pour le Nouveau Mexique suivre le programme
académique Earthship Biotecture. Comme je voulais que mon Lodge soit
écologique, c'était une très bonne opportunité pour nous deux de travailler
ensemble par la suite. 
Elle a donc intégré mon
projet en mettant en application les principes de construction Earthship:
électricité solaire et éolienne, traitement des eaux usées, utilisation de
matériaux recyclés et naturels, récupération de l'eau, production alimentaire. 

                   

De retour au Pérou, j'ai
acheté un terrain à Iquitos pour lancer Inti Eco Lodge. 
Nous avons commencé le
projet de construction en Novembre 2014 et depuis nous avons réalisé plusieurs
constructions et améliorons constamment l’état du terrain avec l’aide de locaux
et de bénévoles internationaux.


CONSTRUCTION ECO RESPONSABLE
Inti
Eco Lodge sera construit avec les arbres de la forêt qui seront remplacés
immédiatement. Nous utilisons des matériaux recyclés trouvés à Iquitos et ses
environs. L'eau de pluie est traitée et utilisée à plusieurs reprises et
l'énergie solaire fournira l'électricité (photovoltaïque). 
Une serre et un espace de permaculture seront
productifs toute l'année. Nous mettrons en place un système d'évacuation des
eaux usées (égouts) qui ne polluera ni la terre, ni les rivières environnantes,
et permettra l'arrosage d'une des plantations extérieures de fruits et légumes. 

          Ainsi, ""l'eau
noire"" des éviers de cuisine (contenant des matières solides) ira
directement à la fosse septique où elle sera traitée pour ensuite alimenter la
cellule botanique extérieure. 
En revanche, ""l'eau grise"" des douches
et éviers de la salle de bain ira alimenter la culture de fruits et légumes de
la serre.
Une
piscine naturelle fonctionnera  grâce à
un système de pompes et de deux bassins, un pour la baignade et l’autre qui se
chargera d’épurer l’eau par la minéralisation de la matière organique par les
plantes aquatiques. 

SERRE/ AQUAPONIE/
PERMACULTURE 




Nous allons construire une
serre adaptée au climat équatorial de l'Amazonie péruvienne qui produira des
fruits et légumes et du poisson tout au long de l'année. Sa construction
respectera les trois principes de conception durable: 
- Earthship, habitation 100%
autosuffisante et durable.

- Aquaponie, culture de
végétaux en ""symbiose"" avec l'élevage de poissons.

- Serre solaire passive,
absorbant le soleil pour maximiser la chaleur et le gain solaire.

Nous appliquerons un concept fondamental de Earthship : ""l'eau
grise"" des douches et lavabos, une fois purifiée, resservira à l'arrosage
de nos cultures dans la serre.
Le système de recyclage des eaux permet, non seulement d’économiser des
ressources mais aussi de produire une alimentation plus saine tout en préservant
l’environnement.
Après quelques années, sa production s’avérera être bénéfique
tant par sa variété que par sa qualité et permettra aussi au lodge d’être plus indépendant.



Avec l'aide et la connaissance
des communautés voisines, nous utiliserons la terre et le compost pour la
permaculture et la croissance des plantes médicinales. 

Le compost que nous avons fait permet la fermentation des produits organiques
qui est ensuite incorporé aux terres agricoles afin de les enrichir. 

PLANTES AND CHAMANISME
Les Cultures Indigènes de l'Amazonie ont développées une
connaissance extraordinaire des propriétés curatives des plantes médicinales,
en particulier pour ses effets purgatifs, de guérison et visionnaires. Ces
plantes sont appelées « Plantes Maîtresses » comme l'Ayahuasca, Tabac, Shiric
Sanango, Toë, Ajo Sacha, Oje, San Pedro ...
Le mystère est que sur 80 000 espèces de plantes en
Amazonie, comment les chamans ont-ils pu découvrir les combinaisons de
celles-ci pour une utilisation médicinale? 
Ils croient que s'ils remplissent certaines conditions
d'isolement et suivent un régime alimentaire prescrit, ces plantes sont
capables de leur « enseigner » comment diagnostiquer et guérir les maladies,
comment effectuer d'autres tâches chamaniques (prophétie, télépathie, nettoyage
interne) et comment utiliser les plantes médicinales à travers des chants
appelés Icaros.

                                     

Iquitos est un des lieux les
plus célèbres où vous pouvez trouver et utiliser les plantes maîtresses avec
des chamans/curanderos. Les raisons varient, mais les thèmes sont souvent
communs. Cela va de la nécessité de renouer avec le passé archaïque, au désir
de continuité avec la conscience de l'Antiquité ou encore le désir d'être plus
connecté avec la nature et le monde spirituel.

Pour les personnes intéressées, nous proposons des cérémonies et des retraites
avec des chamanes à travers l’utilisation de plantes pour connaître et
transmettre leurs vertus thérapeutiques.

                          

BENEVOLAT ET TOURISME 
Nous construisons le centre
avec l'aide de bénévoles du monde entier. Nous affirmons qu’en rassemblant des
personnes de différents horizons, âges et professions, mais partageant le même
intérêt, nous fait vivre à tous une expérience des plus enrichissantes. 
Certains bénévoles n'ont
aucune expérience en construction, mais simplement la volonté d'apprendre et
d’aider. D'autres ont les connaissances et compétences en terme de
construction, d'architecture, biotecture ou permaculture. 
Il n'y a pas de condition requise pour
se joindre à nous.

                       
                     
                       

Nous voulons réfléchir
collectivement et partager des idées afin de trouver les solutions les mieux
adaptées et durables et montrer l’exemple.
Ensemble nous pouvons donner vie à ce projet !

RAPPORTS AVEC LES COMMUNAUTES AVOISINANTES
Les bénéfices permettront
d'améliorer le lodge, d'aider les communautés voisines, et seront aussi réservés
à des programmes de reforestation, aux ONG et aux tribus péruviennes.
Nous échangeons déjà des
idées avec les locaux sur la façon de construire et de vivre de manière plus
durable, il s'agit d'un
partage de connaissance pour un meilleur vivre.

                   

Nous aimerions aussi les
sensibiliser sur les différentes alternatives à l'évacuation habituelle des
eaux, polluant les terres et le fleuve Amazone, en optant par exemple pour des
toilettes sèches puis leur montrer comment endiguer, traiter et distribuer les
eaux usées. 
Nous partageons l'eau et les
soins à base de plantes avec les communautés voisines afin de promouvoir
l'entraide. Nous fournissons du travail et de la nourriture. Ainsi nous
mélangeons nos communautés parce que nous avons beaucoup à apprendre les uns
des autres. Nous ne cherchons pas à envahir leurs terres et à les
industrialiser, nous voulons, au contraire, renouer avec la nature et avec tout
ce qu'elle a à offrir.

Bienvenidos a Inti Eco Lodge Crowdfunding Fase 1 !  



« Estamos absolutamente seguros
de que usted puede encontrar un país pacífico unido en torno de un nuevo
proyecto de colaboración para un futuro mejor, la modernidad, el bienestar y el
respeto por el otro, en estrecha cooperación con el mundo. Dijo » Nicolas
Hulot, el periodista-reportero Frances con el compromiso de proteger y mejorar
la conciencia pública sobre el medio ambiente.
A través de este proyecto, queremos
promover y crear nuevos modelos de vida sostenibles con nuestros recursos y
nuestro medio ambiente. Nos gustaría lograr una combinación perfecta de vivir
en la naturaleza, en un hábitat inusual, ser respetuosos con el medio ambiente,
y al mismo tiempo, revitalizar el cuerpo y la mente.
Inti Eco Lodge Eco Lodge será el
primero en utilizar los conceptos de Earthship (casas ecológicas y
autosostenibles) en Perú y en la Amazonia. 
Compartimos y educamos a nuestros
clientes, sino también con nuestras comunidades vecinas y voluntarios de todo
el mundo, la cultura, los productos ecológicos y locales, el bienestar y la
espiritualidad.
Nuestro principal objetivo es crear
una experiencia única y auténtica, en un centro del bienestar no lucrativo, en
el corazón de la Amazonía peruana.

EL PROYECTO



Inti Eco Lodge será una alternativa
al turismo convencional en Perú. Vamos a invitar a la gente a venir a pasar su
estadia en este lugar especial de aprendizaje y el desarrollo personal. 
El
objetivo es construir un centro de bienestar sin fines de lucro, para crear una
comunidad basada en la autosuficiencia, donde cada uno puede vivir una vida
saludable, aprender a vivir de manera sostenible, diversión, relax, sanar,
desarrollar proyectos y expresar su creatividad.  
                                                                                                
El centro será 100% Eco Friendly!


Inti Eco Lodge ofrecerá diversas
actividades dedicadas al bienestar y el desarrollo individual, como el yoga, la
meditación, la danza y el masaje. Otras áreas estarán dedicadas al desarrollo
de la creatividad, como la pintura y la escultura, talleres de descubrimiento
de la medicina natural, cocina, jardinería, o cómo hacer crecer sus propias
frutas, verduras y plantas medicinales.


El centro estará equipado con una
piscina natural y los huéspedes pueden disfrutar de la pesca con los lugareños.
La Casa Larga ""Maloca"" (lugar sagrado) estará dedicada a las
ceremonias chamánicas para permitir que las personas interesadas puedan llegar
a un cierto nivel espiritual, o durante períodos de dieta y meditación.

Las tarifas de su estadia dependerá
del alojamiento, actividades y de su presupuesto, para que o lodge sea accesible
a todos! 
Varias opciones de alojamiento están disponibles: un dormitorio (con
dos camas y un espacio para la hamaca), bungalows básicos (con cama doble o dos
camas individuales,un aseo y un baño público) o superior (aseo y cuarto de baño
privados ) y casas de lujo en el árbol.

                             

                             

Ofrecemos una experiencia única para
todos los viajeros, turistas o personas en busca de sí mismo.El Lodge es una organización sin
fines de lucro, los beneficios serán donados a organizaciones no
gubernamentales, la reforestación, las comunidades circundantes, empleados,
tribus peruanas de protección y la vida silvestre. Algunos de los beneficios
también se utilizarán para mejorar y mantener el Lodge.

SOBRE NOSOTROS
Soy Anne, llegué a Perú hace tres
años, cuando yo tenía 25 años. Desde que era muy joven siempre he estado
fascinada por América del Sur y de la Amazonía, así que después de mis estudios
de negocios internacionales en París y luego de turismo internacional en
Australia.llegué a Perú para iniciar mi propia
agencia de viajes con eco-tours.


 La idea de Inti Eco Lodge venía de una
experiencia en Iquitos, en la Amazonía peruana. Fui allí para aprender sobre
las plantas medicinales y el chamanismo para juzgar su eficacia para tratar mi
depresión. Yo estaba en la selva durante 5 semanas con un chamán / curandero, haciendo
dietas de plantas. Esta experiencia me hizo bien y me dieron ganas de crear un
centro para ayudar a otros. 

En diciembre de 2013, volví a
Francia para encontrar a mi amiga Marion, una amiga de Australia. Ella me dijo
que iba a Nuevo México para ir a la Academia de Earthship y como yo quería
hacer mi Eco Lodge, pensé que sería genial si pudiéramos usar mi centro en uno
de sus proyectos.
Así que ella está en mi proyecto, en
la implementación de los principios de Earthship construcción: energía solar y
eólica, tratamiento de aguas residuales, el uso de materiales reciclados y
naturales, la captación de agua, la producción de alimentos.

                      

Regresé al Perú, y me compré un
terreno en Iquitos para lanzar Inti Eco Lodge. Empezamos el proyecto de
construcción en noviembre de 2014 y desde entonces, hemos hecho varios
edificios y tratamos de mejorar constantemente la condición del lugar con la
ayuda de voluntarios locales e internacionales.

CONSTRUCCION ECO RESPONSABLE
 Inti Eco Lodge se construirá
con los árboles del terreno y serán reemplazados inmediatamente. Utilizamos
materiales reciclados que se encuentran en Iquitos y sus alrededores. De hecho,
se tratará el agua de lluvia y utilizara en varias ocasiones, la energía solar
proporcionará la electricidad (fotovoltaica). 
Un invernadero y un espacio para la
permacultura serán productivos durante todo el año. También vamos a poner en
marcha un sistema de eliminación de aguas residuales (alcantarillado), que no
contaminan ni la tierra, ni los ríos y que permitirá el riego de los huertos
como frutas y verduras. 

            

Por lo tanto, el ""agua negra"" de fregaderos
de cocina (que contiene los residuos sólidos) irá directamente a la fosa
séptica, donde será procesada para luego alimentar la célula botánica exterior. 
Por el contrario, el ""agua gris"" (usada una vez) de las duchas y
lavabos regará los huertos de frutas y verduras del invernadero.
La piscina natural funcionará
mediante un sistema de bombas y dos piscinas, una para nadar y uno que
purificar el agua para la mineralización de la materia orgánica de las plantas
acuáticas.

INVERNADERO / AQUAPONICS / PERMACULTURE

Vamos a construir un invernadero
conveniente para el clima ecuatorial de la Amazonía peruana que producirá
frutas y verduras y el pescado durante todo el año.

Su construcción se cumplirá con los
tres principios de diseño sostenible:
- Earthship, vivienda sostenible
100% autosuficiente.

- Aquaponics, sistema simbiótico con
peces y plantas para cultivar alimentos.

- Invernadero solar pasivo,
absorbiendo el sol para maximizar la ganancia de calor solar.
Vamos a aplicar un concepto
fundamental de Earthship, las ""aguas grises"" de duchas y lavabos, una
vez purificadas, regara nuestros cultivos en invernaderos. El sistema de
reciclaje de agua permite no sólo ahorrar recursos, sino también para la
producción de alimentos más sanos y preservar el medio ambiente. Después de
unos años, su producción será beneficiosa tanto por su variedad como por su
calidad y será independiente. 


Con la ayuda de las comunidades, vamos a utilizar
el suelo y fertilizante para la permacultura y el crecimiento de las plantas
medicinales. 
El compuesto que nos permite que la fermentación de productos orgánicos se
incorpore en tierras agrícolas para enriquecerlas.

PLANTAS Y SHAMANISMO
Culturas Indígenas han desarrollado
un extraordinario conocimiento sobre las propiedades curativas de las plantas
medicinales, especialmente las purgativas, la curación y efectos visionarios
fueron llamados ""plantas maestros"", como Ayahuasca, Tabaco, sanango
Shiric, dedo del pie, Ajo Sacha, Oje, San Pedro ...
El misterio es de 80, 000 especies
de plantas en la Amazonía como chamanes descubrieron el uso medicinal de estas
combinaciones de plantas. 
Es su creencia, si cumplen ciertas
condiciones de aislamiento y siguen una dieta stricta, estas plantas son
capaces de ""enseñar"" a ellos para diagnosticar y curar enfermedades,
para realizar otras tareas chamánicas (profecía, la telepatía, la limpieza, la
curación) y cómo utilizar plantas medicinales, por lo general con melodías o
icaros.

                                       
 Iquitos es uno de los lugares más famosos donde se puede utilizar
plantas chamánicas con los profesionales, los chamanes o curanderos. Las
razones varían, pero hay algunos temas comunes. Una de ellas es la necesidad de
volver a conectar con el pasado antiguo, el deseo de continuar con el
conocimiento de la antigüedad o el deseo de estar más conectados con la
naturaleza y el mundo de los espíritus.
Para los interesados, ofrecemos
dietas y ceremonias con nuestros curanderos a través del uso de plantas para
entender y comunicar sus propiedades terapéuticas.

                            

VOLUNTARIOS Y TURISMO
Estamos construyendo el centro con
la ayuda de voluntarios de todo el mundo. Es una gran experiencia para reunir a
personas de diferentes orígenes, edades y profesiones, pero todos comparten el
mismo interés. Algunos no tienen conocimiento en la construcción, pero tienen
la voluntad de aprender y otros tienen experiencia y habilidades en la
construcción, la arquitectura, Biotecture o permacultura. No hay ningún
requisito para unirse a nosotros. 

                    


                     

Queremos pensar colectivamente y
recoger ideas con el fin de encontrar las soluciones más adecuadas y
sostenibles para ser un ejemplo. 
Juntos, podemos traer vida a este proyecto!

RELACION CON LAS COMUNIDADES VECINAS
El dinero recaudado se mejorará la
casa de campo y sus comunidades, sino que también para la reforestación, las
ONG y las tribus peruanas.
Vamos a intercambiar ideas con
nuestras comunidades sobre cómo construir de una forma más sostenible y cómo
vivir de manera sostenible. No es sólo acerca de la reutilización de materiales
reciclados, el desarrollo sostenible del suelo y el crecimiento de nuestra propia
comida, pero sobre todo el intercambio de conocimientos. 

                     

Quisieramos intercambiar
y enseñar una alternativa para el drenaje de residuos contaminantes de la
tierra y el Amazonas, al igual que los sanitarios secos, por ejemplo, y la
manera de contenerlo, depuración y distribución de aguas residuales. 
Vamos a
compartir el agua y las plantas
medicinales con las comunidades vecinas y promover la ayuda mutua. Ofrecemos
trabajo y alimentos. Así queremos mezclar nuestras comunidades, porque tenemos
mucho que aprender unos de otros. No estamos tratando de invadir su tierra e
industrializar, queremos en cambio nos volver a conectar con la naturaleza y
todo lo que tiene para ofrecer.

<b>The Story</b></p><p>Enjoy the authentic feeling of driving a sports car
with a WENCKSTERN© HotRod:</p>
<span>•<span> <b>
</b></span></span><b>without air conditioning – but with more than enough
fresh air</b><br/><b><span>•<span> 
</span></span>without manual transmission – yet you'll still be the
first to start at the traffic light</b><br/><b><span>•<span> 
</span></span>without power steering – but with immediate feedback
thanks to the sports car steering wheel</b><br/><b><span>•<span> 
</span></span>without all-wheel drive – yet with rear-wheel drive
(even more fun!!!)</b><br/><b><span>•<span> 
</span></span>without a cd-player – yet the sound remains fantastic</b><br/>
<p></p>
<p>The direct steering mechanism resulting in immediate
feedback on road quality takes you right back to the good old times driving
go-carts. The modest weight of the WENCKSTERN© with roughly 150 kilograms is easy on the breaks.
Even though you're nearly seated on the ground and therefore basically
eye-to-eye with the dogs on the sidewalk, the general appearance of the
WENCKSTERN©
easily beats any bigger vehicle. You'll never lag behind due to a maximum speed
of 88 kilometers per hour!</p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1339843/files/20150330145540-hotrod10.png?1427752540"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>The WENCKSTERN© is basically equipped as a single-seater with a 170
ccm engine combined with a<span>  centrifugal
clutch and reverse gearing. The engine performance of 13,6 HP (10 KW) along
with the minimal overall weight of the vehicle ensures very good acceleration potential.
Its' “petite” size turns the HotRod into a real eye-catcher – once you've seen
it, you'll really want to try it out!</span></p><p><span>
</span></p><p>In careful and time-consuming manual labor, our HotRods are manufactured in the Wenckstern factory in Hamburg. The fact
that the HotRods and the concept of HOTROD CITYTOUR are property right-registered as well as approved for usage in public
traffic goes without saying.</p>
<p>You can find more information on our HotRods below...<br/></p>
<p>In Gran Canaria, we solely offer guided tours with HotRods labeled by WENCKSTERN©. Now we're looking to expand our armada by two
additional HotRods – and for that we need your help! Take the chance now with
one of our “Early Bird Perks” and support our idea!</p>
<p>We intend to offer several types of guided round trips
of various duration and length. Our longest tour intent as of yet takes the
participants to the Roque Nublo; the highest mountain of Gran Canaria.<span>  A stretch of around 100 kilometers can be
enjoyed during the five hour round trip in the HotRod. Driving straight through
the country, passing charming mountain villages far away from international tourism
with several stops along the way make this trip unforgettable.</span></p>
<p>In addition to earnings made by our HotRod rental
service, we earn money by selling of various merchandise, rental of unique
hotrod advertising spaces, by direct hotrod sale and after sales services. <br/></p>
<p>We're not the only ones
this far! There are currently multiple “HOTROD CITYTOURS” being offered in
Europe such as Berlin, Essen, Flensburg, Frankfurt, Hamburg, Coblenz, Constance, Munich,
Salzburg, Stuttgart and Mallorca. In the second quarter of 2015, further City
Tours will be launched in Bratislava, Duesseldorf, Goslar, Vienna and on
the isles of Gran Canaria, Ibiza and Sylt (source: Wenckstern). Wenckstern
grants each and every tour location territorial exclusivity. Alongside Gran
Canaria, we've also secured the rights for Fuerteventura, Lanzarote and
Tenerife.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1339808/files/20150330144230-hotrod_citytour_gran_canaria_indiegogo_4.JPG?1427751750"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Should we accumulate a total of more than 25.000 EUR, we will make use of our means by investing in even more new HotRods.<b><br/></b></p><p><b>Other Ways You Can Help</b></p>

<p><a href=""http://www.hotrods.es"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.hotrods.es</a></p></div>","The StoryEnjoy the authentic feeling of driving a sports car
with a WENCKSTERN© HotRod:
• 
without air conditioning – but with more than enough
fresh air• 
without manual transmission – yet you'll still be the
first to start at the traffic light• 
without power steering – but with immediate feedback
thanks to the sports car steering wheel• 
without all-wheel drive – yet with rear-wheel drive
(even more fun!!!)• 
without a cd-player – yet the sound remains fantastic

The direct steering mechanism resulting in immediate
feedback on road quality takes you right back to the good old times driving
go-carts. The modest weight of the WENCKSTERN© with roughly 150 kilograms is easy on the breaks.
Even though you're nearly seated on the ground and therefore basically
eye-to-eye with the dogs on the sidewalk, the general appearance of the
WENCKSTERN©
easily beats any bigger vehicle. You'll never lag behind due to a maximum speed
of 88 kilometers per hour!
The WENCKSTERN© is basically equipped as a single-seater with a 170
ccm engine combined with a  centrifugal
clutch and reverse gearing. The engine performance of 13,6 HP (10 KW) along
with the minimal overall weight of the vehicle ensures very good acceleration potential.
Its' “petite” size turns the HotRod into a real eye-catcher – once you've seen
it, you'll really want to try it out!
In careful and time-consuming manual labor, our HotRods are manufactured in the Wenckstern factory in Hamburg. The fact
that the HotRods and the concept of HOTROD CITYTOUR are property right-registered as well as approved for usage in public
traffic goes without saying.
You can find more information on our HotRods below...
In Gran Canaria, we solely offer guided tours with HotRods labeled by WENCKSTERN©. Now we're looking to expand our armada by two
additional HotRods – and for that we need your help! Take the chance now with
one of our “Early Bird Perks” and support our idea!
We intend to offer several types of guided round trips
of various duration and length. Our longest tour intent as of yet takes the
participants to the Roque Nublo; the highest mountain of Gran Canaria.  A stretch of around 100 kilometers can be
enjoyed during the five hour round trip in the HotRod. Driving straight through
the country, passing charming mountain villages far away from international tourism
with several stops along the way make this trip unforgettable.
In addition to earnings made by our HotRod rental
service, we earn money by selling of various merchandise, rental of unique
hotrod advertising spaces, by direct hotrod sale and after sales services. 
We're not the only ones
this far! There are currently multiple “HOTROD CITYTOURS” being offered in
Europe such as Berlin, Essen, Flensburg, Frankfurt, Hamburg, Coblenz, Constance, Munich,
Salzburg, Stuttgart and Mallorca. In the second quarter of 2015, further City
Tours will be launched in Bratislava, Duesseldorf, Goslar, Vienna and on
the isles of Gran Canaria, Ibiza and Sylt (source: Wenckstern). Wenckstern
grants each and every tour location territorial exclusivity. Alongside Gran
Canaria, we've also secured the rights for Fuerteventura, Lanzarote and
Tenerife.
Should we accumulate a total of more than 25.000 EUR, we will make use of our means by investing in even more new HotRods.Other Ways You Can Help

<p>USA Cares exists to help bear the burdens of service by providing post-9/11 military families with financial and advocacy support in their time of need.</p>
<h1>Our History</h1>
<p>USA Cares is committed to its mission to provide financial and advocacy assistance to post-9/11 active duty U.S. military service personnel, veterans and their families.  USA Cares was launched through a grassroots partnership between the management of WAVE-3 TV (NBC) in Louisville, Kentucky; Kroger Food Stores – Mid-South Division; and the Fort Knox Chapter of the Association of the United States Army.  The organization was dubbed Kentuckiana Cares with a goal to raise funds to help military families in financial crisis through the sale of “Support Our Troops” yard signs.  While $121,000 was raised, the need for assistance proved to be greater than the original initiative could meet.  However, we could not quit on our nation’s heroes or their families. In October 2003, a new 501(c)(3), national organization now known as USA Cares was created with a toll-free call center to process the increasing number of requests for assistance.</p>

We provide services to MaineCare participants, families experiencing financial hardship, refugees, immigrants, and more. Doulas-in-training are matched with experienced mentors who provide support through the course of their services. For example, we have worked with a woman who moved from Burundi while 8 months pregnant and living in a hotel room, and a family whose father was laid off, and their home went into foreclosure, all within 4 months before the baby was due.

</div></div>","Short Summary According to the UNESCAP statement in 2003, PWDs
population is mostly 7% of the total population in Sri lanka. AF believe this
more than is number of people live in the division due to war and internal
displacement and some of the family did not share to any sector due to the
respect of the family.And also social factors such as religious beliefs,
cultural attitudes and societal & family expectations are leads to the
neglect of these vulnerable people hampering the development of their God-given
potentials.
 Arumbugal 
Foundation (AF) was formed in 2012 to create job opportunities for handicapped. AF was launched a project Called ""Sea the Differences"" with 
the financial support of USAID in 2012 end. The main part of the project
 is to produce the handicrafts from natural/Waste material such as Sea 
shell, Coconut shell, Paper...etc and market it to locally and in the 
tourism sector.
Presently we have 50 employees (50% handicapped and 50% members poor family) in the existing production centre to producing the handicraft. The revenue will cover the operational cost and now we are continue the production with our own revenue since June 2014 with out any support from outside.

(Bosses creeps me out) But then My Fiance and I plus two other partners started a business ""The Residence Nilaveli"" a budget hotel and I am a proud member because I learned and I contributed in earning good reviews and making our guests happy.</p><p>Some how the some partners all what they cared about was the money to be banked to their accounts by the end of the month and not to care at all about this place. As for us (Me and My fiance) this is our little world. </p><p>And now we have got the opportunity to buy off the rest of the shares and we are struggling to find the money for that. Since we are in business we hardly comply with what banks need hence which is why it is hard to apply for a loan.</p><p>We need approximately about US$ 7,000 to buy the shares which in Sri Lankan Rupees 450,000/- per share.

(Bosses creeps me out) But then My Fiance and I plus two other partners started a business ""The Residence Nilaveli"" a budget hotel and I am a proud member because I learned and I contributed in earning good reviews and making our guests happy.Some how the some partners all what they cared about was the money to be banked to their accounts by the end of the month and not to care at all about this place. As for us (Me and My fiance) this is our little world. And now we have got the opportunity to buy off the rest of the shares and we are struggling to find the money for that. Since we are in business we hardly comply with what banks need hence which is why it is hard to apply for a loan.We need approximately about US$ 7,000 to buy the shares which in Sri Lankan Rupees 450,000/- per share. And the rest to make some upgrades and modifications. Each and every valuable person who contributes (depending on the contribution) gets to stay at The Residence Nilaveli for Free of Charge with Breakfast. ;) Even if we don't make the whole amount needed before the deadline we will still pay what ever we have collected to the partners so that at least that amount is reduced from the total cost.As you can see on Booking.com, Agoda and Trip Adviser I worked really hard for 7 months to bring up this place up to this standard, I learned how to cook delicious meals, I learned how to make and keep every one happy and positive because even though this is a business this is also my world, what I always dreamed of.

<p>While working in the restaurant and wine industry for over two decades, I realized that few wine enthusiasts know what goes into making a great wine. </p>
<p>So in 2007, I created a company that combines the excitement of wine blending, wine tasting, and wine education for small private parties to large corporate events. Our events help wine enthusiasts understand the artistry and science that goes into wine making, allowing them to appreciate the subtle distinctions of a wine; uncorking a new and fun wine tasting experience.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1443828173/eiqhuy9siunmskxe7fcz.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>The concept took off and people really enjoy the experience, especially when they get to take their own wine blend home. Now, I want to share this unique experience with wine enthusiasts around the world who can’t attend one of these events.</p>
<p><b>Not another boring bottle of wine:</b></p>
<p>Invited over to a dinner party? Don't arrive with another boring bottle of wine. Be the ""(wo)man of the hour"" and present your lovely host with a VinoBlends kit. And while the lemon-rosemary chicken is roasting, the cheese and spinach pockets are baking, tomato basil soup simmering, and the kids on their iPads, unbox the VinoBlends kit and get blending. Heck, adults deserve fun pre-dinner activities too. </p>

<p>Blending wine is the process of combining different wine varietals to create a composite that's better than any of the wines separately. The wines blended might be from different varieties, different regions, different wood—and non-wood-aging, different vintages, and even wines made from different fruit.</p>
<p><b>Did you know? Wine makers don't have to label their wine as a blend as long as 75% of the wine is from a single varietal.</b></p>

</div></div>","Unleash your inner vintner—Bring the behind-the-scenes experience and essence of Napa Valley into the comfort of your own home to create wine that is original and distinctly yours. No reservations, VIP access, or experience needed. Just you, a few friends, and your VINOBLENDS KIT.

While working in the restaurant and wine industry for over two decades, I realized that few wine enthusiasts know what goes into making a great wine. 
So in 2007, I created a company that combines the excitement of wine blending, wine tasting, and wine education for small private parties to large corporate events. Our events help wine enthusiasts understand the artistry and science that goes into wine making, allowing them to appreciate the subtle distinctions of a wine; uncorking a new and fun wine tasting experience.

The concept took off and people really enjoy the experience, especially when they get to take their own wine blend home. Now, I want to share this unique experience with wine enthusiasts around the world who can’t attend one of these events.
Not another boring bottle of wine:
Invited over to a dinner party? Don't arrive with another boring bottle of wine. Be the ""(wo)man of the hour"" and present your lovely host with a VinoBlends kit. And while the lemon-rosemary chicken is roasting, the cheese and spinach pockets are baking, tomato basil soup simmering, and the kids on their iPads, unbox the VinoBlends kit and get blending. Heck, adults deserve fun pre-dinner activities too. 

Blending wine is the process of combining different wine varietals to create a composite that's better than any of the wines separately. The wines blended might be from different varieties, different regions, different wood—and non-wood-aging, different vintages, and even wines made from different fruit.
Did you know? Wine makers don't have to label their wine as a blend as long as 75% of the wine is from a single varietal.

People love the experience of being a winemaker for the day, and VinoBlends delivers this experience in a beautifully packaged kit with everything you need to blend 100% varietals to discover the wine that you enjoy the most—just like the winemakers do at the wineries. 
Blending your own wine can be done in five fun and simple steps:

Each VinoBlends kit will include everything you need to be a winemaker for a day. Here's a sneak peak of the prototype.




*wine glasses not included
 Each kit will include the following items:

Three (3) 100% pure varietal wine sourced from an award-winning boutique Napa Valley winery (2013 vintage: Merlot, Cabernet Franc, and Cabernet Sauvignon)
One (1) empty wine bottle to bottle and serve your own custom blend
One (1) glass graduated cylinder to precisely measure your variations
One (1) glass beaker to precisely measure your favorite blend 
One (1) glass funnel to make sure you bottle each precious drop
One (1) placemat to map out the blending process
One (1) VinoBlends wine bottle opener
One (1) VinoBlends ballpoint pen
One (1) notepad to record your wine tasting journey and preferences
One (1) reusable cork to temporarily store your custom blend
How-to DVD to walk you through the wine blending steps
Introduction and tasting descriptors sheet of the three 100% varietals


We’ve put in a lot of time and resources over the past few months to get to this stage, and we need your help with the final push to get these kits to production and into your hands.

</h3><h3>Hope Car Wash of Dallas/Fort Worth</h3>
<p><b>Thank you for visiting our page. If you have
a moment, please give us some of your time and learn about Hope Car Wash!</b></p>
<p>My name is Alex Anderson and my wife and I
live in downtown Dallas. We have only been
residents of Dallas for a few months, but shortly after we arrived, we couldn’t help but notice the large homeless population in our city. </p>
<p>After several encounters, we came to the conclusion
that a large portion of these people have desires and goals that far-exceed receiving
spare change. Several of the people we have met are more excited to talk about
job opportunities than they are to receive donations. These are the people that we want on our team.</p>
<p>We want to combine the explosive
service-on-demand market with civil service. We want to make our community a
more positive place for people of all walks of life, but most importantly, we
want to change lives by providing new opportunities to people who haven't given
up on themselves or their goals.</p>
<p><b>Hope Car Wash</b> will allow these individuals,
who are able and willing to perform physical work, to improve their lives. We
will provide incentive based pay, work uniforms with complimentary laundry
service, and daily meals to individuals who want to work. Compensation will be a
direct reflection of productivity. This structure, along with <b>one property manager</b> (per site)
providing <b>direction</b> and <b>leadership</b>, will help to inspire these individuals to
improve their lifestyles. </p>
<h4><b>Structural Outline:</b></h4>
<ul>
<li><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">We
     will create partnerships with local commercial and residential properties
     that will allow us to rent space within their parking structures.</span></li>
<li><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">After
     a select few initial team members are operational, we will put our

<span style=""font-weight: normal;"">The
     cost of car washes will be determined on a per-facility basis to account

<h4><b>The Impact:</b></h4>
<p>Given the proper attention to detail, and

beautiful city. After streamlining our process in Dallas, we intend to spread
our presence into every major city in the United States.</p>
<h4><b>Risks &amp; Challenges:</b></h4>
<p><b><i>Trust:</i></b> Our main challenge will be developing <b>trust amongst our clients</b>. To help alleviate
initial concerns, our <b>initial offerings
list will only consist of exterior</b> hand washes, tire/wheel cleaning,
and window treatments. Once a property manager feels comfortable enough with a
team at one of our locations, we will add in our second level of offerings to
customers. This will also help facilitate the marketing campaign, as customers
will be able to see the quality and simplicity of service provided by Hope Car
Wash.</p>
<p><b><i>Operational Space:</i></b> Our second challenge will be establishing contracts with
properties, as companies will likely want to see established legitimacy before
executing contracts. However, this site will be our initial source of
credibility. So will the soon to be executed contract with the Olympus

<h3>Old School Quality<br/>
</h3>
<p>Dallas Hudson soaps are made using the traditional cold process with up to 85% organic ingredients (which is about as good as soap can get). They contain no SLS or other sulfates, parabens, phthalates, synthetic fragrances, dyes, DEA, EDTA, triclosan, synthetic preservatives, paraffin, tetrasodium etidronate, petrochemicals, or common allergens.</p>
<p>After mixing smaller batches of vegetarian oils and water with lye, a.k.a. sodium hydroxide (a USDA allowed ingredient in organic products), nature takes over to produce a mild, eco-friendly soap. Exfoliants, essential oils and other natural ingredients are added to leave you feeling and smelling great. But before it's ready for sale, Dallas Hudson soap must be aged 4 to 6 weeks. Depending on bathing habits, each fully hardened bar lasts about a month.</p>
<p>The smooth lather and uplifting aroma of our Morning In America™ soap makes 
it hard not to be hopeful. With the warm color of sunrise it reminds you
 that and each new day is full of possibilities. Ingredients include 
saponified vegetarian oils, including palm oil, sunflower oil, coconut 
oil and olive oil, as well as orange essential oil for color and 
fragrance.<br/></p>
<h3>Eco-Friendly &amp; Cruelty Free</h3>
<p>A recent study found that bar soap is much easier on the environment than liquid soap in many important ways, including carbon footprint, ecotoxicity, ozone depletion potential, and eutrophication potential. Liquid soaps require five times more energy for raw material production and nearly 20 times more energy for packaging production than bar soaps do. And on a per-wash basis people use more than six times the amount of liquid soap (by weight) than bar soap.</p>
<p>Because Dallas Hudson soaps are made the old fashioned way, no animal testing is needed to ensure they are safe. In fact, except for our goat milk soaps, all of our products are vegan, containing absolutely no animal by-products.</p>

Almost 10,000 U.S. soldiers will remain deployed in Afghanistan through 2016. So there is still a need to support our heroes who are going the distance. And Morning In America™ orange citrus soap is the kind of uplifting little luxury that says they are not forgotten by all of us back home.

can enjoy. It's our mission to refresh and inspire strength with a

<h3>Us &amp; Annie's</h3>
<p>We are Susan and Brianna (or Sue and Bri!) and we're SO CLOSE to owning Annie's Book Stop, a small local book store in West Boylston, MA. This store has been around for 30 years, and as the current owners are looking to partially retire, they want to sell. We've already put a deposit down, and need a little lift to come up with the remaining balance by the 1st of October!</p>
<p>Susan has been working part time at the store for a few years now, and both of us have been customers for many, many years. Annie's is a little oasis for us, as well as many of its loyal customers, and we're going to do anything we can to save it!</p>
<p>As moms, with 6 kids between the two of us, it has taken a lot of time, money, and effort to get this far. We're hoping that you might help us fund this dream of ours, as the possibility of it slipping away is too close for comfort.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>We need about $5,000 to pay off our remaining balance on the store, and to help us pay rent for October.</p>
<p>If you help us fund this adventure, and we hit our goal, come visit us at the shop in October and we'll help you out with some store credit!</p>
<h3>The New Annie's</h3>
<p>We have such big plans for Annie's, and hope to bring it back to life and modernize it while still keeping its charm. Some of our most important plans:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a new children's area, and increase children's book selections.</li>
<li>Initiate a more organized, prevalent web presence so people can connect with us.</li>
<li>Update the inventory system, so we can more easily help our customers in-store.</li>
<li>Create recognizable brand for our Annie's.</li>
<li>Apply even more eco-friendly practices to the business.</li>
<li>Connect with our community!</li>
</ul>
<h3>Challenges</h3>
<p>We've evaluated the risks and challenges of taking this on. There are already business practices put in place that make Annie's easy to run, even passively. We do not intend on being passive, and have very high hopes for increasing sales and making Annie's an even more sought out book store than it already is! We are ready to put in a ton of hard work and elbow grease to get Annie's where we want it to go!</p>

<p><strong>Out of the Abyss: Empowering Ideas to Beat Drug Addiction</strong></p>
<p><strong>Very short pitch</strong>: Drug addiction - isolation, shame, broken relationships and careers. I am a life coach for those suffering from addiction; I am launching a life coaching business and am producing an audio book to provide drug recovery insights.</p>
<p><strong>Short pitch</strong>: Hi. I am Dr. Peter Grigg and drug addiction and alcoholism nearly destroyed my family and me in 2009.  I am in long-term recovery, which means that I have not used alcohol or non-prescribed medications, to affect the way that I think, feel or act, for 8 years.</p>
<p>Long-term recovery has given me hope and stability and allowed me to create a better life for my self, family and community and motivated me to found Pikes Peak Recovery Coaching. I have a heart for professionals such as doctors, dentists, lawyers and nurses suffering with addiction, thus PPRC's mantra ""help professionals recover.""  And, I will provide services to the LGBTQ community.</p>
<p>What's my secret sauce? My style and technique is a blend of lived addiction experience, life coach training and being a practicing physician for over 20 years. I am also a writer, actor and voice over artist with a creative drive to produce materials that entertain, inform and provide helpful strategies for those suffering with the disease of addiction.</p>
<p>Addiction leads to chaos, prison and death. If you are reading this you likely know someone...such as a family member, good friend or employer whose life has been ravaged by drug addiction and you wish you could do something to help.</p>
<p>Help support my campaign and you will help addicts recover locally in Colorado Springs as well as Colorado and nationally. One option PPRC will offer is a way to talk to a coach anonymously via a disguised voice, factious name and masked credit card.</p>
<p>Your support will also help produce materials that can assist with the recovery process.</p>
<p>Additionally, money raised during this campaign over $8,000 will provide some scholarships for coaching services.</p>
<p>I will do my best to pick, create and give away meaningful backer prizes and gifts. If they are too lame please let me know and I'll improve them.</p>
<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<p>Breaking down the funding request for launching a life coaching business and producing a one hour audio book:</p>
<p>Life Coaching Business will require one-time expenses as well as three months of operating expenses and a contingency fund. In the US, launching a life coaching business takes between $6,000 and $12,000. I can do a full launch of Pikes Peak Recovery Coaching for <strong>$5750.</strong></p>
<p><strong>One time expense</strong>: $2300 for rent deposit, website, office equipment such as used laptop; printer and other equipment required by HIPPA for security, and incorporation fees. I donated two old laptops but both have since died.</p>
<p><strong>Three months operating expenses</strong>: $2700 ($900/mo) which includes rent, software and online coaching platform, phone, office supplies, marketing materials, insurance, book keeping and misc expenses.</p>
<p><strong>Contingency fund of 15%</strong>: $750 for unexpected expenses.</p>
<p><strong>Production of 1-hour audio book</strong>: $2,000</p>
<p>I will have research expenses, office, office supply, computer expenses and production expenses such as: a professional narrator, studio time required for recording, an audio producer, an audio editor for all post-production work, re-cuts as needed during the approval process, digital cover artwork design/re-design for audio version of script, mastering, encoding and delivery of the completed audio files as well as CD reproduction with cases.</p>
<p>The budget also includes the cost of promotional videos, photos and support to help the audio book reach as many hearts as possible.</p>
<p><strong>Total Requested</strong>: $8,000</p>
<p>All raised funds will go to launching Pikes Peak Recovery Coaching and doing the audio book project. I will keep fund raising, working, donating from my retirement account until PPRC fully launches.</p>
<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<p>Coaching services will reduce rates of relapse and help those suffering from addiction have and create a better quality of life.</p>
<p>We believe the audio book will have insights and truths to offer all types of backgrounds and walks of life. Addiction doesn't care about your profession, economic status, race, religion, or sexual orientation. The audio book and other digital products will be made available online and physical products will be made available to treatment centers, peer health programs and correctional institutions. </p>
<p>I believe I can accomplish these goals because of my experience running a medical practice, publishing written works and successfully completing acting and voice over projects. I have access to a recording and movie studio and teams that will help me produce materials.</p>
<p>In addition, I have mentors from the business community and the Small Business Development Center.</p>
<p><strong>Risks &amp; Challenges</strong></p>
<p>I am passionate to complete this project. I have successfully completed other writing projects and contributed to film/commercial products so I respect timelines and force myself to stay organized and work a plan. My wife helps me stay on schedule. I can get the audio book project done in 5-6 months post funding. One to two months’ research, one month to write a final production script, three months to produce two final products (CD and mp3 files for download.) I will be held accountable by my business mentors.</p>
<p><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></p>
<p>I know economic times are tough and some people just can't contribute. My hope is that you can talk the project up with your friends and family. Please share my project on social media such as Twitter, Facebook and any blogs that you participate in. Please use Indiegogo share tools.</p>

<h3>Breve reseña</h3>
<div style=""text-align: justify;"">Nuestro nacimiento como cooperativa es en el año 2012, dónde nos organizamos principalmente pescadores del rió Mixtequilla, ubicado en el Estado de Oaxaca al sur de México. Nuestra idea de proyecto surge de la problemática de escasez de peces en el medio natural del rió, cercanos a nuestra comunidad surgieron proyectos de acuacultura, dónde alimentaban principalmente a los peces con alimento balanceado industrial, el cual nunca tuvo aceptación por la gente de la comunidad, así nosotros nos propusimos criar peces en un ambiente natural, con alimentación orgánica para ofrecer a nuestra gente un alimento saludable y que conservara el mismo sabor, además que nuestra actividad no tuviera impacto negativo en el ambiente. </div>
<div><ul><li style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Así fue como emprendimos este proyecto con recursos propios de los socios, durante 3 años consecutivos hemos solicitado financiamiento gubernamental sin resultados, bajo el argumento que nuestro proyecto no se alinea a los lineamientos del programa, nosotros creemos en que es posible otra forma de producir alimentos sanos ricos en proteína sin perjudicar el ambiente y sin comprometer la salud humana, a esto hemos llamado acuacultura natural, actividad sin agrotoxicos, ni piensos industriales. Nuestra base es la cooperación ética, responsable y no la competencia sin principios éticos. </span></li></ul></div>
<ul> <li>Durante estos 3 años hemos consolidado nuestra confianza en la cooperación de la gente, hoy creemos mas en la gente que en las instituciones de gobierno, gracias al apoyo decidido de muchas personas hemos logrado avanzar con este proyecto, hoy queremos continuar con la segunda etapa del proyecto, iniciar la reproducción de crías directamente en nuestra granja, agregar valor a nuestro producto y hacer que llegue a mas personas, Consolidar nuestro proceso de producción de alimento alternativo para la engorda de los peces. Por ello esta campaña es clave para lograr estos resultados en este año que comienza, confiamos en la gente como tú, sabemos que podemos financiarnos colectivamente con mayor autonomía sin comprometer nuestros sueños y nuestro ideal de una comida sana para nuestra gente.</li>
<li><br/></li> <li><br/></li> </ul> <p><br/></p> </div> <div> <h3>Lo que necesitamos y lo que obtienes</h3> <p><br/></p> <ul> <li>
<ul>
<li style=""text-align: justify;"">Con el financiamiento obtenido se comprara equipo especializado para el aprovechamiento de residuos agricolas y convertirlos en nutritivos alimentos alternativos para nuestros peces. </li>
<li style=""text-align: justify;"">Se instalara y equipara un Laboratorio para la reproducción de crias y repoblar nuestros áreas de cultivo y engorda. </li>
<li style=""text-align: justify;"">Se equipara una pequeña nave agroindustrial para obtener filete y aprovechar los huesos para harina de pescado y cerrar el ciclo de producción. </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<div style=""text-align: justify;""><br/></div>
<ul> <li>Te invitamos a que vengas a conocer nuestra granja, a vivir nuestra experiencia  como una de nuestras recompensas exclusivas o compartimos nuestra caminar para emprender nuevos proyecto. </li> <li>De no alcanzar la meta los recursos obtenidos se destinaran a los objetivos prioritarios: </li>
<li>1.- Adquisición de equipo para producción de alimento alternativo.</li>
<li>2.- Instalación y equipamiento de una Unidad de Reproducción de Crias. </li>
<li>3.- Construcción y equipamiento de micronave agroindustrial para valor agregado. </li> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>El impacto</h3> <p>De consolidar nuestro proyecto con tu financiamiento, será un ejemplo a seguir para muchos productores de nuestra región y el mundo, demostraremos que es posible alimentar al mundo sin destruir al planeta, brindado un alimento rico en proteina de manera natural, saludable. Es difícil encontrar experiencias similares, a diferencia de la agricultura, dónde la producción orgánica crece cada día y hay infinidad de experiencias, en la producción de peces no es así, son escasos. </p>
<p>Hemos logrado obtener ya las primeras cosechas y ha tenido gran éxito, una gran aceptación por la gente de nuestra comunidad por el sabor, y bajo costo de producción. </p> </div> <div> <h3>Riesgos y desafíos</h3> <p>Es la primera vez que realizamos este tipo de campaña de recaudación, al no contar con experiencia creemos que es nuestro mayor desafió para alcanzar nuestra meta, pero confiamos en la gente, en la solidaridad y seguro que lograremos superar haciendo uso de redes sociales, red de amigos, etc. </p>

Nuestro nacimiento como cooperativa es en el año 2012, dónde nos organizamos principalmente pescadores del rió Mixtequilla, ubicado en el Estado de Oaxaca al sur de México. Nuestra idea de proyecto surge de la problemática de escasez de peces en el medio natural del rió, cercanos a nuestra comunidad surgieron proyectos de acuacultura, dónde alimentaban principalmente a los peces con alimento balanceado industrial, el cual nunca tuvo aceptación por la gente de la comunidad, así nosotros nos propusimos criar peces en un ambiente natural, con alimentación orgánica para ofrecer a nuestra gente un alimento saludable y que conservara el mismo sabor, además que nuestra actividad no tuviera impacto negativo en el ambiente. 
Así fue como emprendimos este proyecto con recursos propios de los socios, durante 3 años consecutivos hemos solicitado financiamiento gubernamental sin resultados, bajo el argumento que nuestro proyecto no se alinea a los lineamientos del programa, nosotros creemos en que es posible otra forma de producir alimentos sanos ricos en proteína sin perjudicar el ambiente y sin comprometer la salud humana, a esto hemos llamado acuacultura natural, actividad sin agrotoxicos, ni piensos industriales. Nuestra base es la cooperación ética, responsable y no la competencia sin principios éticos. 
 Durante estos 3 años hemos consolidado nuestra confianza en la cooperación de la gente, hoy creemos mas en la gente que en las instituciones de gobierno, gracias al apoyo decidido de muchas personas hemos logrado avanzar con este proyecto, hoy queremos continuar con la segunda etapa del proyecto, iniciar la reproducción de crías directamente en nuestra granja, agregar valor a nuestro producto y hacer que llegue a mas personas, Consolidar nuestro proceso de producción de alimento alternativo para la engorda de los peces. Por ello esta campaña es clave para lograr estos resultados en este año que comienza, confiamos en la gente como tú, sabemos que podemos financiarnos colectivamente con mayor autonomía sin comprometer nuestros sueños y nuestro ideal de una comida sana para nuestra gente.
      Lo que necesitamos y lo que obtienes   

Con el financiamiento obtenido se comprara equipo especializado para el aprovechamiento de residuos agricolas y convertirlos en nutritivos alimentos alternativos para nuestros peces. 
Se instalara y equipara un Laboratorio para la reproducción de crias y repoblar nuestros áreas de cultivo y engorda. 
Se equipara una pequeña nave agroindustrial para obtener filete y aprovechar los huesos para harina de pescado y cerrar el ciclo de producción. 




 Te invitamos a que vengas a conocer nuestra granja, a vivir nuestra experiencia  como una de nuestras recompensas exclusivas o compartimos nuestra caminar para emprender nuevos proyecto.  De no alcanzar la meta los recursos obtenidos se destinaran a los objetivos prioritarios: 
1.- Adquisición de equipo para producción de alimento alternativo.
2.- Instalación y equipamiento de una Unidad de Reproducción de Crias. 
3.- Construcción y equipamiento de micronave agroindustrial para valor agregado.     El impacto De consolidar nuestro proyecto con tu financiamiento, será un ejemplo a seguir para muchos productores de nuestra región y el mundo, demostraremos que es posible alimentar al mundo sin destruir al planeta, brindado un alimento rico en proteina de manera natural, saludable. Es difícil encontrar experiencias similares, a diferencia de la agricultura, dónde la producción orgánica crece cada día y hay infinidad de experiencias, en la producción de peces no es así, son escasos. 
Hemos logrado obtener ya las primeras cosechas y ha tenido gran éxito, una gran aceptación por la gente de nuestra comunidad por el sabor, y bajo costo de producción.    Riesgos y desafíos Es la primera vez que realizamos este tipo de campaña de recaudación, al no contar con experiencia creemos que es nuestro mayor desafió para alcanzar nuestra meta, pero confiamos en la gente, en la solidaridad y seguro que lograremos superar haciendo uso de redes sociales, red de amigos, etc.

<strong>VERSIONE ITALIANA SOTTO</strong><h3></h3>
<p>My name is Caroline Chirichella. </p>
<p>Those of you who know me know that food is my passion. I live, sleep, eat (quite literally) and breathe food. To me, food is so much more than it appears to be. It's a way to express myself creatively. It's an art. I love every aspect that goes into preparing a meal; writing up the grocery list, searching for the best possible ingredients, testing recipes until I feel they are just right, plating my creations and even searching for the perfect spoon to accent my signature salted caramel budino. From a young age, my fondest memories involve food. Whether it was my late grandma Nettie making me fried cauliflower or my mom taking me to a nice restaurant before seeing ""La Boheme"", I always associate food with fond memories. To this day, if I prepare my grandma Nettie's fried cauliflower, the scent and taste still bring tears to my eyes. If you're lucky, food can make you remember something wonderful. Food is family. Food is magic. Food is love. </p>
<p>In 2013, I decided to turn my passion into a reality and launch <a href=""magicandpastaevents.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>Magic &amp; Pasta Events</strong></a>. In the short time since launching, my supper club was named one of the<a href=""http://www.newyork.com/articles/restaurants/fabulous-secret-supper-clubs-in-nyc-98775/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""> <strong>eight best dining experiences in New York</strong></a>, up there with Gabriele Corcos of the hit cooking channel TV show “Extra Virgin."" Now I want to bring that same type of dining to Guardia Sanframondi. </p>
<p>Guardia Sanframondi is a beautiful medieval village located
in the South of Italy just an hour outside of Naples. When I came to Guardia
for the first time in October 2014, it was love at first sight. I loved the
feeling of community and I loved that it was just two hours away from where my
great-grandfather was born. When I
finally found my house, what immediately made it stand out to me was the
beautiful cantina and backyard. I could see the bones of the space and knew
that this would make an amazing spot for a restaurant. But, the cantina and
backyard are in need of a complete restoration and I need some help to turn my
dream into a reality. That’s where you come in...</p>
<p>In a short time, we have seen new businesses opening in
Guardia Sanframondi due to a recent tourism boom. By investing in this
restaurant, you’re not just investing in a business, but you’re investing in
the future of Guardia. Further, my cantina is located near Piazza San Filippo
Neri and I love the idea of there being a restaurant in this immediate area. </p>
<p>Coming from a background in theatre, opera and burlesque, my
goal is to bring a feeling of “performance” into my restaurant. You will see me
cooking in the kitchen, chatting with my guests and every now and then I may
randomly burst into my favorite Puccini aria. I want my restaurant to have a
casual and comfortable vibe, where everyone is welcome. Where you will feel
like family. Guardia has welcomed me with open arms and now I want to do the
same. By inviting you into my restaurant and cooking for you, I am asking you
to be part of my family. I want my restaurant to be as much for you as it is
for me. If you have a suggestion, I want to hear it. Here are some details I want to give you about my plan: </p>
<p><strong>* Rome was not built in a day….just as this restaurant won’t
be. It will take time but it will also be a group effort. From contractors, to
painters, to electricians to handymen, this will not be realized without the
help of local professionals. </strong></p>
<p><strong>* Locally sourced food and wine which will contribute to the
local economy. What you see on your plate came from someone you most likely know. </strong><strong>The wine you’re drinking is sourced from your favorite local cantina. The olive
oil came from the vineyard just down the road. </strong></p>
<p><strong>* We will have an outdoor garden and seating area. You will be
surrounded by fresh, beautiful herbs and know that the basil and parsley on
your plate came from our own backyard. </strong></p>
<p><strong>* A different kind of cuisine: I want to say this clearly. I
will not be serving traditional Italian food. The area already has some of the
best Italian food I’ve ever eaten, so there is no need for me to serve you
Italian dishes that you already have access to. My cuisine combines the best
of what our international community has to offer: American, Spanish, Asian,
Italian, etc. Imagine Spicy Tuna Tartare Tacos, Italian Fried Chicken &amp;
Waffles, Deconstructed Caprese Salad, Bourbon Pumpkin Soup with Honey Whipped Crème
and Thyme Parmesan Shortbread and Pork Belly &amp; Watermelon Skewers! </strong></p>
<p><strong>* We will be offering vegetarian, vegan and gluten free options. Don’t see
something on the menu that you’re craving? Tell us. If we have the ingredients,
we will prepare it especially for you. Our menu will change weekly to allow us
to best use what is fresh and in season. </strong></p>
<p><strong>* Guardia has a burgeoning artistic community and I want to
create a space to express yourself creatively. Open mic nights, poetry slams,
artist showcases, music sessions, etc. </strong></p>
<p><strong>* Being so close to military bases in Naples we don’t want to
forget those who fight for this great country and we will be hosting Military nights
where our armed service men will receive special discounts thanking them for
their great sacrifice.</strong></p>
<p><strong>* We plan on hosting Ladies Only nights to give women the
opportunity to naturally be themselves and talk openly about what is on their
minds.</strong> <strong>In addition, we will also be hosting women’s only events such as readings, natural cooking classes, etc.</strong> </p>
<p>
</p>
<p><b>* Take a book, leave a book: The world is fueled by words. Keeping
in line with the creative theme of our restaurant, we invite our guests to
bring a book that they no longer need and leave it on one of our communal book
shelves and browse through our collection and borrow another book. This way,
our books are recycled and can find new homes. </b></p>
<p>I want this to be a space for the community. Not just a
restaurant. Not just a place to come and get a good meal. But a place for you.
For your children, for your grandparents, for everyone. A space where
creativity can flow. Every amount helps, even a dollar can go a long way. If you can’t contribute financially, even just sharing this on social media or sending an e-mail to your friends can help this campaign grow in more ways than you can imagine. </p>
<p>Everyone has a dream and I’m inviting you to be part of mine. </p>

<strong> </strong><ul><li><h3>Short Summary</h3></li></ul>
<strong>
</strong><p><strong>Billie Jo: </strong>I got my start with natural products by becoming a certified herbalist in 1996, and combined it with an enthusiasm for helping customers find solutions in a retail setting as the herbalist at the San Francisco Whole Foods Market. </p>
<p>After almost 7 years in retail, I saw an opportunity to enter the professional pet care business. Starting with a few dog-walking customers, over the next 13 years I grew my company into a six-figure business, with full-time employees and a wide menu of services for our clients, from pet-sitting and daily walks, to training classes. </p>
<p>During my years building the pet care business, I found that more and more people are seeking all-natural products for their pets - products that are creative, renewable, and fun - and that they want to rely on a store that serves them within a caring and friendly community.

</div></div>","Short Summary

Billie Jo: I got my start with natural products by becoming a certified herbalist in 1996, and combined it with an enthusiasm for helping customers find solutions in a retail setting as the herbalist at the San Francisco Whole Foods Market. 
After almost 7 years in retail, I saw an opportunity to enter the professional pet care business. Starting with a few dog-walking customers, over the next 13 years I grew my company into a six-figure business, with full-time employees and a wide menu of services for our clients, from pet-sitting and daily walks, to training classes. 
During my years building the pet care business, I found that more and more people are seeking all-natural products for their pets - products that are creative, renewable, and fun - and that they want to rely on a store that serves them within a caring and friendly community. So, I'm starting Wellness Pet Supplies! The Wellness Pet Supplies store will be Ashland’s leading provider of homeopathic, herbal, vitamin-based, organic, hypo-allergenic food, toys and beds, with a core passion for the longevity and  well-being of animals. I'm excited about using all of my entrepreneurial, retail, customer, and pet-care skills to build a happy community and a long lasting business.     What We Need & What You Get
As a contributor, you'll be helping us to offer a full spectrum of health support to Ashland's pets, in a holistic way, with a splash of fun and class. All in an area that currently does not have this kind of pet supply store. 
I've saved $15K, and  I need an additional $50K to launch. Your contributions will pay for the build-out, products on the shelves, the store's opening, and the first few months of the lease. 
Let's do this - for Ashland, for its great people, and for its precious animals!
We don't expect you to aid us for nothing, so I've got some fun PERKS in exchange for helping out. 
These include:

Store discounts, store credit, and many different products.
Gift baskets that will include products and some fun items such as water bottles, wine and beer. 
There are also some beautiful trip rewards, at the $5K contribution level, for you to enjoy Ashland Oregon and its culture. 
Furthermore, everyone who contributes gets an invite to our Grand Opening Party at the store. A great way to see your funds in action!
(If all of the contributions don't add up to the full $50K goal, I'll obtain a bank loan for the remainder, to ensure that I meet my opening day goal of Fall 2016.)

     The Impact
I'm founding and cultivating a place for people to purchase products that support a healthy and happy life for their pets. I come to this project with experience and skills particularly suited to this area expertise, and I guarantee customer satisfaction.
I started a pet care business from scratch and turned it into a six figure, thriving business with a loyal clientele. I've also been a certified herbalist for 20 years. This new business will combine these two passions, pet care and natural product solutions, and offer it to a marketplace that's just beginning its steepest growth.
Your contributions mean that pets in the Ashland area will have the best chance to live longer, fuller lives, and will be able to be protected against factors that we humans well understand, such as environment, stress, injury, age, food issues, and allergies. 
    Risks & ChallengesAlong the way I might struggle to find the right location in time for my planned Fall 2016 opening. Another challenge might be the need to acquire a bigger loan than earlier expected, and working out a plan for meeting the monthly payments right away. I'll also be faced with the learning curve of launching a business in a city where I'm still gaining familiarity, meeting people and finding my way around.I am more than qualified to handle all of these challenges. 
I'm tenacious when it comes to my research, including my search for locations. I always find what I'm looking for. I start early, revisit leads often, and scour the marketplace until I find what I need. 
In my 13 years of owning a business, I've always made payroll, paid my bills on time, and paid my taxes. Even when things were tight, and I wondered how I would get it all done, making these payments was non-negotiable for me.

<p><b>Nanostead is a grassroots business that
is more than just another</b> (Small Scale) building company.  Yes, we provide top quality, energy efficient
homes like plenty of other builders in Western North Carolina, but our vision is
beyond the home envelope.  Nanostead
connects clients to their land through thoughtful and educated home and land
design.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Our
houses are just the “RIGHT” size for each of our clients, but our focus isn’t
only on the house.</b> Our clients are interested in becoming more
self-sufficient. With population on the rise and our
environment in need of real love and attention, we advise our clients on all aspects of a small, yet functional footprint.  From the land they are thinking of buying or
already own, to the most detailed aspects of their home design, we advise
clients through the entire process to create the right-sized homestead of their
dreams.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Our
goal is to create and distribute all of the necessities for small scale homesteading by developing the <b>One Stop Homestead Shop,</b> including a model small scale
homestead, a <b><i>Nanostead</i></b>! </p>
<p><b>The One Stop Homestead Shop of
Nanostead </b>will showcase a tiny home, greenhouse, small outbuilding, gardens,
fencing, solar packages for power, water catchment, livestock housing, and a play
structure to provide a real example of small-scale homesteading, along with a retail store for the supplies you need.  We will also provide education and consultation
for people who want to do it themselves.   </p>

<p><b>Nanostead
is based in beautiful rural Madison County, NC. 
</b>We have acquired a wonderful commercial space between a major highway
and historic downtown Marshall.  There
has been a lot of attention to this area as Asheville’s housing prices soar and
more people move to this rural area to get back to the land and start their own
small scale homestead (Nanostead).  </p>
<p>We have reached out to other businesses in our community to create partnerships focused on sustainability. Our
initial partner companies that we are working with include <b><i>Southeast Ecological Design</i></b>, <b><i>Ramble &amp; Root - edible landscapes, Symbiosis
Design Build, and Sugar Hollow Solar company</i></b>.</p>
<p><b>We
are very passionate about Nanostead and want to take it to the next level.</b>
Having an all-weather building facility, shop, office space, and retail showroom will
allow us to become a more efficient business <i>where we can demonstrate

Nanostead is a grassroots business that
is more than just another (Small Scale) building company.  Yes, we provide top quality, energy efficient
homes like plenty of other builders in Western North Carolina, but our vision is
beyond the home envelope.  Nanostead
connects clients to their land through thoughtful and educated home and land
design.

Our
houses are just the “RIGHT” size for each of our clients, but our focus isn’t
only on the house. Our clients are interested in becoming more
self-sufficient. With population on the rise and our
environment in need of real love and attention, we advise our clients on all aspects of a small, yet functional footprint.  From the land they are thinking of buying or
already own, to the most detailed aspects of their home design, we advise
clients through the entire process to create the right-sized homestead of their
dreams.

Our
goal is to create and distribute all of the necessities for small scale homesteading by developing the One Stop Homestead Shop, including a model small scale
homestead, a Nanostead! 
The One Stop Homestead Shop of
Nanostead will showcase a tiny home, greenhouse, small outbuilding, gardens,
fencing, solar packages for power, water catchment, livestock housing, and a play
structure to provide a real example of small-scale homesteading, along with a retail store for the supplies you need.  We will also provide education and consultation
for people who want to do it themselves.   




Nanostead
is based in beautiful rural Madison County, NC. 
We have acquired a wonderful commercial space between a major highway
and historic downtown Marshall.  There
has been a lot of attention to this area as Asheville’s housing prices soar and
more people move to this rural area to get back to the land and start their own
small scale homestead (Nanostead).  
We have reached out to other businesses in our community to create partnerships focused on sustainability. Our
initial partner companies that we are working with include Southeast Ecological Design, Ramble & Root - edible landscapes, Symbiosis
Design Build, and Sugar Hollow Solar company.
We
are very passionate about Nanostead and want to take it to the next level.
Having an all-weather building facility, shop, office space, and retail showroom will
allow us to become a more efficient business where we can demonstrate
to clients the best options for their Nanostead dreams. 


Our goal is to be as
affordable as possible, by using all of our best resources and working with
clients to make appropriate decisions so projects can run smoothly. Creating
this showcase space will strengthen our ability to design and manufacture homes
and outdoor installations in a faster and more financially conservative way for
both Nanostead and our clients, while demonstrating to the community what they
can realize on their own land.  
We
want to build a sustainable business and help as many people achieve the dream
of affordable homesteading! Our vision for the future is to work with organizations
that offer transitional housing for the homeless, Veterans and low-income
families. It will take time, but with your help we can get a good jump start as
we develop the service side of our business!


We
are seeking funding for the creation of our establishment in a commercial
space.  There is plenty of room to grow
at our new space but it will take a long time without investing in these few
crucial things:



Cover the cost of the lease
and utilities for at least a year to lower our overhead and focus on our
amazing clients and seeking new clients.


Office and shop supplies


Build a large Pole-Barn that
can provide the space to build portable homes, store materials and eventually
Pre-Fab small home production


Certifications from RVIA so clients
can insure and finance their portable Nanostead homes.


Create a demonstration of a Nanostead homestead with a model tiny house including
solar, water catchment, raised bed gardens,outbuilding, livestock housing, greenhouse and even a play
structure for the kids while you tour the facility.


The use of the
proceeds will go as follows:
Rent and Utilities =$9,200.00
Under Roof building facility = $7,000.00
Office/Shop Needs = $2,000.00
RVIA certified = $2,000.00
Tiny homestead model = $40,000.00 + material
donations
Total = $60,200.00





We understand not everyone can contribute.

<h3>What's our track record with similar projects?</h3>

We have also had the great pleasure in collaborating with the <a href=""https://www.anchoragemuseum.org/exhibits/winter-up-here/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Anchorage Museum</a> on several temporary sculptural installations.</p>
<p>This project provides an unprecedented opportunity for us to meld together our passions and create socially activated sculptural installations that will be permanent fixtures in our parks for everyone to enjoy for years to come. <br/></p>

<h3>What Challenges Lie Ahead?<br/>
</h3>Our largest hurdle with this project is raising the $21,700 matching funds that the Anchorage Park Foundation has agreed to sponsor.  We have proven time and again that we are able to complete similar projects, yet fundraising is brand new territory for us and an entirely different process for us to embark on.  However, something that works in our favor is that we love being challenged!<br/><br/>In the event that we are successful in raising the matching funds and meet the $43,400 Challenge Grant total, the next hurdle to overcome is the raising of an additional $16,600 to achieve our desired goal of $60,000 for the entire project.<br/><br/>We are well versed in overcoming challenges and hurdles as it applies to projects with minimal or strict budgets.  Past projects like our ALPAR project or the Engine 556 project have.  Alaska is a very big place, filled with big-hearted individuals that are no strangers to sharing and pitching in to lend a hand.  We continue to reach out into the community and foster connections that reinforce community engagement within our process and projects.<br/><h3><br/></h3>

(The Impact) Your support of this project will help facilitate the creation of spaces and objects that :  Expand ways in which locals and visitors alike can enjoy the Anchorage park and trail system.
 Place design emphasis on passive recreation elements that cater to a wide crossection of our community and create destinations for people of all ages and abilities.
Strengthen socially conscious design initiatives and projects in Alaska.
 Create engaging, all inclusive seating elements that ensure everyone has acess to enjoying our great parks and trails.
Create a sense of destination and iconographic wayfinding points for trail and park users.
Promote creative interventions in an urban 'wilderness' of unparalleled beauty.
With Alaska being such an expansive landscape, having ways that instigate the creation of shared experiences and fostering intimate perspectives of the landscape is beneficial for all.

Expand the notion of what a 'bench' can or should be. 
    



What's our track record with similar projects?
Over the last three years, we have begun to broaden our project scope and have been involved with several public oriented projects in the Anchorage park system.  Within those projects, we have attempted to integrate as many place-specific and project-specific elements as possible.  Within the same time-frame, we have been involved in a number of creative urban interventions that celebrate life in the North. We have also had the great pleasure in collaborating with the Anchorage Museum on several temporary sculptural installations.
This project provides an unprecedented opportunity for us to meld together our passions and create socially activated sculptural installations that will be permanent fixtures in our parks for everyone to enjoy for years to come. 






What Challenges Lie Ahead?
Our largest hurdle with this project is raising the $21,700 matching funds that the Anchorage Park Foundation has agreed to sponsor.  We have proven time and again that we are able to complete similar projects, yet fundraising is brand new territory for us and an entirely different process for us to embark on.  However, something that works in our favor is that we love being challenged!In the event that we are successful in raising the matching funds and meet the $43,400 Challenge Grant total, the next hurdle to overcome is the raising of an additional $16,600 to achieve our desired goal of $60,000 for the entire project.We are well versed in overcoming challenges and hurdles as it applies to projects with minimal or strict budgets.  Past projects like our ALPAR project or the Engine 556 project have.  Alaska is a very big place, filled with big-hearted individuals that are no strangers to sharing and pitching in to lend a hand.  We continue to reach out into the community and foster connections that reinforce community engagement within our process and projects.

What We Need & Why
So why do I suddenly need to move you ask? On Christmas Eve of 2015 I found a roof leak in my shop. And then found another. And another. And another. Not little roof leaks that had been there a few days, big ones that had been there for years. The kind where I could see daylight, complete with wood so rotten it was just crumbling, and mold. Lots and lots of mold, even in the air ducts. I had no idea any of it was there, as I wasn't allowed on the roof or in any of the areas with issues due to clauses in my lease. The only reason I found them was because part of the ceiling fell in, and that's how I started finding things. 







I did what anybody would do, I called my landlord and asked for help and that they fix the problem. Well...they wouldn't fix it. They told me to 'put some ceiling tiles over it' and pretend it wasn't there. I asked for help over and over and over, and couldn't get them to even acknowledge there was a mold problem or major damage to the building. I tried to hire somebody to fix it myself and wasn't allowed to do so because of clauses in my lease. 
I have lupus and fibromyalgia. I've been progressively getting 'sicker' the past 8 or 9 months...since I'd moved into the building. I'd been breathing in toxic mold for 9 months and didn't even realize it. I'm on steroids, multiple inhalers, breathing treatments, numerous allergy meds, & have been told not to even be in the building anymore.

I found this place (mold and rot free!) 10 minutes up the road from my current shop.

The Impact
 For the sake of my business, and for my health/general welfare, I'm here asking for some help. This means more than I can put into words, because honestly, my little shop is my life. I've worked so hard on it, & never in a million years would I have thought 9 months into a 3 year lease I'd have to be doing this right now, but my landlord just won't fix my current place no matter what I do, so any and all help is going to be appreciated on so many levels.
    Risks & Challenges The worst I can do is fail. But failing at the 'new' location is better than 'succeeding' at my current location in a 'sick' building. 
    Other Ways You Can Help Some people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean you can't help:
WAIT... Some people don't have money. Not even $10. And that's ok! You can still help me get the shop ready to open to the public. Do you have gently used or new supplies, furniture, building materials, or well...what do you have? I just may have a use for it. (I'm that girl that steals old windows from the side of the road, I have all kinds of uses for all kinds of things.)
Post, retweet, reshare and email it to everyone you know. You can still make a difference. 
Or do you have something else that I'm totally missing but you know I'm gonna need it? Give a girl a shout, & I'll give you a listen.

<p>In
Spring of 2010, together with our Chicago based partner organization<b>

that provides free Permaculture and <b>I</b>nformation <b>T</b>echnology (IT)
training to local farmers and youth in Uganda. Our center serves as a resource for information and training in
areas of need such as agriculture, education and health to local farming communities.  Our work has benefited over 120,000 people since 2008. <i>Our pitch video above gives you a brief insight into some of our projects.</i><br/></p>
<p>In 2015,  Vancouver based Lush Manufacturing gave us a $5000 SEED grant that supported  training 7621 farmers in 2015 alone.   177 <a href=""http://www.icodan.org/2015_donors.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">individual donors</a> also supported our different projects across the country in 2015.  <b>We love permaculture </b>and farmers who do the <i>dirty work,</i> that's why our permaculure trainings are free for all small-holder farmers<br/></p>

<br/><ul>
<li>
We want to work with 11000 more farmers and make our program efficient and sustainable.  </li>
<li>We want to train more 10000 farmers in 
permaculture,  1000 farmers in Information Technology and work with 
1000 school 
children to plant 10000 food trees in their schools, homes and communities. <br/>
</li>
</ul>We
 need over $50000 to do this and support our multiple-year food security projects! Since its the start of the year, we 
thought it would be an excellent opportunity to secure $5000 of our 
total goal.  <br/><br/><h3><b>WHY IT MATTERS<br/></b></h3>
<ul>
<li>
We
 all need food and farmers to grow it. We're supporting farmers and school children to 
grow food in an ecologically 
sound manner.</li>
<li>
We're creating
 a community where people can reconnect with their food source. We’ll be
 offering hands-on learning at farm events 
throughout the year.<br/>
</li>
<li>
We're focused
 on regenerative agriculture and restoring the land to a healthier 
state. We are conserving for our  future food and environment systems <br/>

self-sufficient food production systems and regenerate the ecosystems that
provide for their communities<b>.</b>  <br/><br/> School children will be trained and given fruit trees (mangoes, papaya, oranges, jackfruit, bananas and even coffee) to plant in the schools, homes and communities. They will have control over what they eat! <br/><br/>Farmers will use their training in Information Technology to retrieve relevant information (focused
on, but not limited, to agriculture - such as market access and prices, disease
and pest control methods, weather patterns, etc) from the training center and use the information to improve their production, lives and communities. <br/> <br/>

and extend permaculture and environmental conservation training to youth,
teachers and school children.</p>
<p>We
are an  incredibly cost-effective organization and we strive to ensure that all funds are put to intended purposes.<b> So,
every dollar you donate will be used only on purposes included in this campaign.<br/></b></p>
<p>-$1 provides a farmer with a banana tree<br/></p>
<p>-$6 provides a farmer with one coffee tree.</p>
<p>- $70 gives a group of 30 -70 farmers a bicycle they can use to train more farmers<br/></p>
<p>- $80 donation will help pay for a 30 minutes radio show through which 
farmers can share personal stories with thousands of listeners.<br/></p>
<p>- $120 – gives 250 farmers garden-based training <br/></p>
<p>- $130 - Will help  Flavia, one of our most progressive female farmers get 
60 trees of coffee to plant in her farm. We have worked with Flavia 
since 2008 and she has helped organize and train many women 
farmers in her community. Your donation will give her 60 coffee trees 
to plant in her farm where trains other farmers.</p>

women in sustainable agriculture principles, they can build increasingly
self-sufficient agriculture systems. </p>

2008, we have been using community organizing and agriculture as a catalyst for
social change by bringing people together across social, economic, and cultural
barriers. <b>We want to continue doing this year and beyond. Support our work

are ICOD Action Network; We are an East Africa based nonprofit. 


In
Spring of 2010, together with our Chicago based partner organization
Project Focus, we created and implemented a solar powered Internet Center
that provides free Permaculture and Information Technology (IT)
training to local farmers and youth in Uganda. Our center serves as a resource for information and training in
areas of need such as agriculture, education and health to local farming communities.  Our work has benefited over 120,000 people since 2008. Our pitch video above gives you a brief insight into some of our projects.
In 2015,  Vancouver based Lush Manufacturing gave us a $5000 SEED grant that supported  training 7621 farmers in 2015 alone.   177 individual donors also supported our different projects across the country in 2015.  We love permaculture and farmers who do the dirty work, that's why our permaculure trainings are free for all small-holder farmers

 

WHAT WE NEED



We want to work with 11000 more farmers and make our program efficient and sustainable.  
We want to train more 10000 farmers in 
permaculture,  1000 farmers in Information Technology and work with 
1000 school 
children to plant 10000 food trees in their schools, homes and communities. 

We
 need over $50000 to do this and support our multiple-year food security projects! Since its the start of the year, we 
thought it would be an excellent opportunity to secure $5000 of our 
total goal.  WHY IT MATTERS


We
 all need food and farmers to grow it. We're supporting farmers and school children to 
grow food in an ecologically 
sound manner.

We're creating
 a community where people can reconnect with their food source. We’ll be
 offering hands-on learning at farm events 
throughout the year.


We're focused
 on regenerative agriculture and restoring the land to a healthier 
state. We are conserving for our  future food and environment systems 



IMMEDIATE IMPACTThousands
of farmers will be able design their own environments and build increasingly
self-sufficient food production systems and regenerate the ecosystems that
provide for their communities.   School children will be trained and given fruit trees (mangoes, papaya, oranges, jackfruit, bananas and even coffee) to plant in the schools, homes and communities. They will have control over what they eat! Farmers will use their training in Information Technology to retrieve relevant information (focused
on, but not limited, to agriculture - such as market access and prices, disease
and pest control methods, weather patterns, etc) from the training center and use the information to improve their production, lives and communities.  




HOW WILL MONEY BE USED?
The
estimates are to the best of our knowledge given our experience to-date. All
funds will be for farmers’ utilization, training
and extend permaculture and environmental conservation training to youth,
teachers and school children.
We
are an  incredibly cost-effective organization and we strive to ensure that all funds are put to intended purposes. So,
every dollar you donate will be used only on purposes included in this campaign.
-$1 provides a farmer with a banana tree
-$6 provides a farmer with one coffee tree.
- $70 gives a group of 30 -70 farmers a bicycle they can use to train more farmers
- $80 donation will help pay for a 30 minutes radio show through which 
farmers can share personal stories with thousands of listeners.
- $120 – gives 250 farmers garden-based training 
- $130 - Will help  Flavia, one of our most progressive female farmers get 
60 trees of coffee to plant in her farm. We have worked with Flavia 
since 2008 and she has helped organize and train many women 
farmers in her community. Your donation will give her 60 coffee trees 
to plant in her farm where trains other farmers.


IT'S ONLY FARMERS, IT'S COMMUNITIES! 
Your contribution will not only benefit farmers!









David Magala, the Coordinator of an organization of People Living with HIV/AIDS stated that “Lack of access to sustainable food sources  affects our  health and lives.  I believe that this kind of project will help more People Living with HIV/AIDS live healthier lives and live longer since they will have access to healthy food"" 





Our project benefits will spread across different sections of our communities. Be part of a farmer's story.




THIS IS WHY WE NEED THE MONEY
90%
of all rural women in Uganda  work in agriculture and women make up the
majority of the agriculture groups that we work with. By training  these
women in sustainable agriculture principles, they can build increasingly
self-sufficient agriculture systems. 
Since
2008, we have been using community organizing and agriculture as a catalyst for
social change by bringing people together across social, economic, and cultural
barriers. We want to continue doing this year and beyond. Support our work
to build food secure communities. 
SOME OF OUR STAFF
MICHAEL AHABWE MUGERWA - Executive Director
ALLENAH NINSIIMA -  International Programs Director

See how our community Information Technology Center was launched back in 2010!


WHAT HAPPENS IF WE FAIL TO RAISE THE MONEY?
Over 33000 people that are directly or indirectly benefiting from our food security and Information Technology projects will loose out, farmers will no longer have access to training and our center that you've watched in the video above will be closed. We don't want to see this happen! Every bit help, make a small donation.

BEYOND MONEY - WE NEED YOUR HELP SPREADING THE WORD

We
are a grassroots organization driven by staff and volunteers who work hard
everyday to ensure our works sustainably  benefits communities we work
with. Be part of our team and help spread the work and encourage friends to
contribute.


WHAT HAPPENS IS WE RAISE MORE THAN OUR $5000 GOAL

If
we very lucky to raise more, we will use extra funds raised to reach out to more
farmers and save money to expand on the program in 2016 and beyond. 
With
your financial support, we will be able to train more farmers in information
technology and  permaculture and work with schools and students to regenerate their
environments.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hello!</p>
<p>My name is KerryAnn Ash.  Mother of three, 2 girls and 1 boy.  I had this idea floating around in my head for about a year.  However, I decided to kick it into high-gear and get it out of my head and into the streets, the more I watch my son grow.  </p>
<p>Although only 5 years old at this point, he is very high on personal grooming and his appearance.  He likes getting his nails clipped, head massaged, feet rubbed, you get the picture!</p>
<p>With the idea in mind and the influence of my son, I started asking the males I knew and women about their husbands, and if they got manicures and pedicures.  Some said that they do.  Others said they would do it more, if they didn't feel ""girly"" going to the nail places that are around town.  Some men said not a chance.  But when I mentioned what I wanted to do, their eyes lit up!  Then their answer changed, to ""Yes, I would go to a place like that.""</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The majority of the funding is going into the truck.  It is going to cost about 100,000-110,000 to get customized to the specifications we require.  The remaining of the funds raised in this campaign will go to the insurance, licences required, marketing, supplies, and the 1st month salary of the technicians.  Any overage and/or additional funds raised, will be saved and go towards the brick and mortar location at a later time.  (Not too much later, hopefully!)</p>
<p>We hope to be on the road by July.  If you back this campaign, and you live in the Raleigh/Durham area, we will receive an invite to the ribbon cutting ceremony!!  </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The biggest challenge for us at this point, is getting the funding required to get the mobile vehicle built to customization of the theme.  We do not foresee any other major hurdle(s) once we receive the funds to get the truck on the road.</p>

<h3>Zee &amp; the Penthouse</h3>
<p>This poor penthouse cafe with a million dollar view is in need of a facelift.  Local business owners <a href=""http://www.zeechristopher.com/chef-zahn-accolades.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Chris Zahn</a> and <a href=""http://www.ethosdesignremodel.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Sarah Cunningham</a> have taken on that challenge.  They are asking our Boise community to assist in helping them raise the funds needed to creating a top-notch top tier event venue (inspired by <a href=""http://perchla.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">The Perch</a>) for everyone to enjoy for years to come.  If you purchase one of our offered PERKS now we will be able to complete ALL of the items on our remodeling list.</p>
<p><u><i><strong>We have designed this crowdfunding campaign to give YOU something for supporting us.</strong></i></u>  Purchase one of our perks and it is like we are giving you money.  In order to complete our wish list during the remodel we need to raise more funds so we are offering what we do best at a discounted rate - food and events.  Take a look at the perks and see if there is one that matches your needs.</p>

<p>We are asking for support to raise an additional $80,000 in funds to complete the full extent of the remodel. This includes a kitchen privacy wall, kegerator, new cooler, and modern lighting to create a unique and inspired space for our guests to enjoy for years to come.  Without the additional support of our community we will not be able to fully complete the entire vision we have for the CW Penthouse as the premier wedding/event venue overlooking our much-lauded downtown within the remodeling schedule of February/March 2017.</p>
<p><strong>WISH LIST:</strong></p>

<p>Bringing the CW Penthouse into the 21st Century with a clean, neutral remodel will allow us to break ahead of other venues and stand tall atop the city - with unobstructed views of the downtown, foothills, and gorgeous Idaho sky.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>We are committed to the remodel and re-introduction of the CW Penthouse to our Boise community.  If we are unable to reach our goal of $80,000 we will downsize our vision and postpone some of the wonderful details we would like to complete in the first round of remodeling.</p>

(We are planning to add roll up doors to marry the patio and the interior dining area, creating more options for our clients, in 2018)  We will begin round 2 of the remodel once we are fully funded and have completed the initial list of tasks.</p>

The Impact
By investing in our space you are an integral part of the growth of downtown Boise as the hub of cultural and social activity.  
Bringing the CW Penthouse into the 21st Century with a clean, neutral remodel will allow us to break ahead of other venues and stand tall atop the city - with unobstructed views of the downtown, foothills, and gorgeous Idaho sky.

Risks & Challenges
We are committed to the remodel and re-introduction of the CW Penthouse to our Boise community.  If we are unable to reach our goal of $80,000 we will downsize our vision and postpone some of the wonderful details we would like to complete in the first round of remodeling.
With the help of our design partners at Ethos Design + Remodel & Real Estate  we will prioritize what design elements our clients would like to see done in the first round and begin to build capital for round 2 of the remodel. (We are planning to add roll up doors to marry the patio and the interior dining area, creating more options for our clients, in 2018)  We will begin round 2 of the remodel once we are fully funded and have completed the initial list of tasks.

Other Ways You Can Help
We know not everyone can contribute directly to our funding requests.  If you would like to help us out in other ways please consider liking us on Facebook and writing a review of our cafe, event venue, or catering services.  You can also follow us on twitter, instagram and pinterest.
And come visit us often at Zee's Rooftop once our doors reopen!  Thanks for the support.

<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>The Problem We Solve and Why It's Great to Support Us!</strong></h3>
<p>Most independently owned restaurants and small hotels (such as B&amp;B's) are started by families, friends, and passionate entrepreneurs.  Owners and their managers typically sacrifice, work long hours, and often invest thousands-upon-thousands of dollars in fulfillment of their dreams. Many of them are instant hits, becoming neighborhood favorites, social and business centers, travel destinations, and employers.  They're also sources of tax revenue for local and federal municipalities, and often add tremendous value to the communities in which they are located.</p>
<p>Such businesses also ultimately provide a great sense of financial independence, professional fulfillment, accomplishment, and prestige for their owners.</p>
<p><strong>So why do most fail?</strong></p>
<p>Unfortunately, most owners and consequently their managers underestimate the scope of expertise, training, attention-to-detail, resources, decision-making, and moment-to-moment supervision required for hotels and restaurants to succeed. Even those who start out fully funded or who buy previously profitable establishments often find themselves overwhelmed by the many variables involved in the day-to-day operations of running a hospitality business.</p>
<p>While research on businesses failure in hospitality once focused primarily on economic and quantitative factors, more and more studies now attribute failure to deficiencies in more qualitative areas: planning, conceptualization, service standards, management, marketing, brand implementation, familial or partnership relationships, staff training, regulatory compliance, bookkeeping, security, location selection, talent retention, alcohol beverage control, technology integration, health and safety, customer relationship management...</p>
<p>The list goes on.</p>

<p><u>Many of our family and friends - and many of yours -  have been affected by this failure rate, either as owners, employees, investors: even customers</u>. The sad truth is, hospitality businesses don't fail because owners and their employees don't work hard or are underfunded; they fail because <strong>most restaurant and hotel owners simply do not know what they're doing</strong>. While this may sound like a harsh assessment of folks we love or admire as family, friends, employers, or even the person in the mirror, the emotional distress and economic impact of such failure is ten times harsher. It's a lesson many hospitality owners unfortunately learn the hard way.</p>

The answer is: Everyone!</strong></u></p><p><strong>Cat Cafes benefit shelter cats</strong> - Our cat cafe will partner with Sun Cities 4 Paws Rescue who will provide us with cats that will specifically be able to thrive in a free-roam environment where people can come visit and socialize with the cats. This free-roam environment allows the shelter cats to have more freedom and not be stuck in a cage, who would otherwise only be brought out when their cage is cleaned or when someone might be interested in adopting them. It’s a more comfortable environment where they can be themselves, and socialize, if they so choose.</p><p><strong>Cat Cafes benefit cat shelters</strong> - Most no-kill shelters are at full (if not over) capacity at all times, and have to turn away surrenders. This leads to cats being dumped, sometimes on the street (which contributes to the ever-growing feral population), and other times at shelters that may not be no-kill. Our cat cafe will help relieve the burden of our partner shelter being over-capacity, and also allow the shelter to accept more surrenders.</p><p><strong>Cat Cafes benefit people</strong> - When you come in after a long day at work, grab a nice hot drink (whether it be tea or coffee), and sit down with our cats, you are allowing the calming effects of cat purrs and snuggles to soothe your inner soul. It’s also scientifically proven that cat purrs are good for your health!</p><p><strong>Cat Cafes benefit local businesses</strong> - Our cat cafe will be partnering with Shelley’s Desserts, downtown Glendale’s local bakery. When you purchase a baked good from our cat cafe, you aren’t just supporting us as a local business, you are supporting other local businesses too!</p><p><u><strong>Where Will My Money Go?</strong></u></p><p>1. Location, location, location! We have a couple places in mind in the Downtown Glendale area that we're very excited about. However, we need funds to secure them. We don't want to deal with landlords (since they're usually not too keen on having animals in their space), so we are planning to buy the property we want, which will require more money upfront, but it means we can do more with the space, and won't have to ask permission to do it!</p><p>2. Build-out/construction. With any location, we will need to have two separate areas, one for the cafe and one for the cat zone. And each part will be required to have separate ventilation systems (due to health regulations) as well as an ""airlock"" between the two areas (two doors between the spaces, so cats can't escape, or accidentally mix with the food-stuffs). There will also be maximum amounts of catification to think about, making sure that there is a separate area for cats to hang out away from the humans, and hiding places, climbing places, and lots of things to scratch/sniff/rub against. We want to create the ultimate kitty haven.</p><p>3. Licensing/Permits. In order to do construction work, and serve food/drinks, we need to have permits to do so.</p><p>4. Cafe equipment/Supplies. If you've ever been to a coffee shop, you know they have lots of shiny, stainless steel equipment. We'll need all of that too, to make sure you get the best quality beverages. We'll also need coffee, tea, cups, lids... well, you get the picture.</p><p>5. Furniture/Supplies. We didn't forget about the humans! We want to make sure you have comfortable places to sit and snuggle with all of our adorable cats! We also plan to have a quiet library room for students and bookworms, with desks and chairs, so they can study or read in the calming presence of fluffy cats. </p><p>6. Indiegogo fees/Perk fulfillment. Indiegogo takes a little of what we make (they have to make money too!) and it also costs us money to give you guys all this awesome stuff (cost of the shirts, shipping/handling, etc)</p><p><u><strong>Sun Cities 4 Paws 2015 Statistics and Background</strong></u></p><p>In 2015, our partner shelter, Sun Cities 4 Paws, took in 927 cats and adopted 882. We are hoping to increase that amount by allowing cats that best fit our model of a free-roam area to come live at the cafe until such a time that they are adopted by their furr-ever family. Our partner shelter is currently capable of housing about 100 cats/kittens at any given time at each of their main locations, and 8-12 at any given time at both of their partner PetSmart locations. During kitten season, they have upwards of 150-200 kittens in foster between both locations.</p><p>Currently, 4 Paws has about 10-12 FeLV+ cats between both locations. Unfortunately for FeLV+ cats, there is a very low chance of getting adopted due to the stigma around cats with FeLV (feline leukemia). As part of our mission at Mews &amp; Brews Cat Cafe, we hope to diminish the stigma around feline leukemia and get more of these cats adopted as they deserve a home just like any other cat. People think that all FeLV+ cats will not live very long. In fact, shelters that are not no-kill will usually put these cats down if they test positive for it. Sun Cities 4 Paws has taken in cats that have tested positive for feline leukemia, rather than put them down. Unfortunately, at this time, they are unable to take in any more unless they can adopt out the ones they currently have, since they require their own separate space away from cats that do not have it.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1485979757/nyfs9byr25fypeeljskd.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>In 2015, 4 Paws only had 28 cats euthanized (see the chart in our photo gallery!), and those cats either had terminal illnesses or were in the senior foster program. Their Asilomar rating is generally in the 96-98% range. In just the last 3 years, close to 3000 cats have been saved from euthanasia and the streets.</p><p>The main challenge of a no-kill shelter is the plight of over-capacity. With people constantly dumping unwanted cats on their doorstep, and a waiting list that extends out for sometimes more than a month, 4 Paws does the best they can. Being a small, no-kill shelter means little to no state/county government funding, excessively high vet/medical costs, dwindling donations, and the difficulty to get grants due to the overabundance of rescues trying to get funding.  </p><p>But we can help. YOU can help.  </p><p>How?</p><p><strong>1. Donate.</strong> Support the start-up of our business so we can help our partner shelter. Our cafe will assist in fostering adoptions, as well as raise awareness to the importance of spaying/neutering your pets. Any amount will help.</p><p>In our photo gallery, you can find a pie chart breaking down where exactly the funds that you donate will go to help us open!</p><p><strong>2. Adopt.</strong> Help us get more cats out of the shelters that are ready to go home, so that the shelters can better assist the cats in need of more specific care. We will host adoptions on-site thanks to the training provided to us by our partner shelter.</p><p><strong>3. Spay/Neuter.</strong> Has your pet been spayed/neutered? Kitten season happens because so many stray/feral cats are not spayed/neutered, and end up contributing to the overall population of strays/ferals by constantly reproducing. If your pet has not been spayed/neutered, please consider doing so. There are a wide variety of free/low-cost spay neuter clinics available. Reach out to us if you would like more information. All of the cats we will have available for adoption will already be spayed/neutered.</p><p><strong>4. Volunteer.</strong> Whether you would like to volunteer at Mews &amp; Brews, or directly at Sun Cities 4 Paws, there is ample opportunity to get your hands dirty.

The concept grew, and gained traction in Japan, where the living spaces are cramped, and most do not allow pets. Cat cafes became a popular destination for young workers looking for companionship and comfort.Mews & BrewsMews & Brews Cat Cafe is a proud member of the Cat Cafe Embassy (http://www.catcafeembassy.com/), whose mission is to get more cats good homes, provide quality drinks and snacks, and be an educational resource for our communities on cat care. We accomplish this by communicating on best practices and providing cozy atmospheres for our cats and customers. We hope to settle ourselves in the Downtown Glendale, Arizona area, specifically Catlin Court.We will be partnering with Shelley's Desserts to provide high quality, homemade tasting desserts, including gluten free items. From the cafe, you will be able to order tea, coffee, lattes, and smoothies.EventsYoga with CatsMewvie NightsBeer/Wine TastingsPaint NightsCrocheting/Knitting with CatsChair Massage EventsAuthor Readings/Play ReadingsArt Showcases by Local ArtistsStudent Finals Week - discount on weekly membership during finals week for students who wish to come in and study for any amount of time, free WiFi includedPrivate Events - If you would like to hold an event such as a birthday party, bridal or baby shower, or other event, you may reserve the entire cat space (there will be a limit on the amount of persons depending on how large our space will be and how many cats will be present)Memberships and DiscountsMonthly Pass - Unlimited visits for one monthly feeStudent Discount - Discounted one-time entry and memberships for students who show student IDVeteran and Senior Discounts - Discounts on one-time entry and membershipsYeah, but who benefits from a cat cafe? The answer is: Everyone!Cat Cafes benefit shelter cats - Our cat cafe will partner with Sun Cities 4 Paws Rescue who will provide us with cats that will specifically be able to thrive in a free-roam environment where people can come visit and socialize with the cats. This free-roam environment allows the shelter cats to have more freedom and not be stuck in a cage, who would otherwise only be brought out when their cage is cleaned or when someone might be interested in adopting them. It’s a more comfortable environment where they can be themselves, and socialize, if they so choose.Cat Cafes benefit cat shelters - Most no-kill shelters are at full (if not over) capacity at all times, and have to turn away surrenders. This leads to cats being dumped, sometimes on the street (which contributes to the ever-growing feral population), and other times at shelters that may not be no-kill. Our cat cafe will help relieve the burden of our partner shelter being over-capacity, and also allow the shelter to accept more surrenders.Cat Cafes benefit people - When you come in after a long day at work, grab a nice hot drink (whether it be tea or coffee), and sit down with our cats, you are allowing the calming effects of cat purrs and snuggles to soothe your inner soul. It’s also scientifically proven that cat purrs are good for your health!Cat Cafes benefit local businesses - Our cat cafe will be partnering with Shelley’s Desserts, downtown Glendale’s local bakery. When you purchase a baked good from our cat cafe, you aren’t just supporting us as a local business, you are supporting other local businesses too!Where Will My Money Go?1. Location, location, location! We have a couple places in mind in the Downtown Glendale area that we're very excited about. However, we need funds to secure them. We don't want to deal with landlords (since they're usually not too keen on having animals in their space), so we are planning to buy the property we want, which will require more money upfront, but it means we can do more with the space, and won't have to ask permission to do it!2. Build-out/construction. With any location, we will need to have two separate areas, one for the cafe and one for the cat zone. And each part will be required to have separate ventilation systems (due to health regulations) as well as an ""airlock"" between the two areas (two doors between the spaces, so cats can't escape, or accidentally mix with the food-stuffs). There will also be maximum amounts of catification to think about, making sure that there is a separate area for cats to hang out away from the humans, and hiding places, climbing places, and lots of things to scratch/sniff/rub against. We want to create the ultimate kitty haven.3. Licensing/Permits. In order to do construction work, and serve food/drinks, we need to have permits to do so.4. Cafe equipment/Supplies. If you've ever been to a coffee shop, you know they have lots of shiny, stainless steel equipment. We'll need all of that too, to make sure you get the best quality beverages. We'll also need coffee, tea, cups, lids... well, you get the picture.5. Furniture/Supplies. We didn't forget about the humans! We want to make sure you have comfortable places to sit and snuggle with all of our adorable cats! We also plan to have a quiet library room for students and bookworms, with desks and chairs, so they can study or read in the calming presence of fluffy cats. 6. Indiegogo fees/Perk fulfillment. Indiegogo takes a little of what we make (they have to make money too!) and it also costs us money to give you guys all this awesome stuff (cost of the shirts, shipping/handling, etc)Sun Cities 4 Paws 2015 Statistics and BackgroundIn 2015, our partner shelter, Sun Cities 4 Paws, took in 927 cats and adopted 882. We are hoping to increase that amount by allowing cats that best fit our model of a free-roam area to come live at the cafe until such a time that they are adopted by their furr-ever family. Our partner shelter is currently capable of housing about 100 cats/kittens at any given time at each of their main locations, and 8-12 at any given time at both of their partner PetSmart locations. During kitten season, they have upwards of 150-200 kittens in foster between both locations.Currently, 4 Paws has about 10-12 FeLV+ cats between both locations. Unfortunately for FeLV+ cats, there is a very low chance of getting adopted due to the stigma around cats with FeLV (feline leukemia). As part of our mission at Mews & Brews Cat Cafe, we hope to diminish the stigma around feline leukemia and get more of these cats adopted as they deserve a home just like any other cat. People think that all FeLV+ cats will not live very long. In fact, shelters that are not no-kill will usually put these cats down if they test positive for it. Sun Cities 4 Paws has taken in cats that have tested positive for feline leukemia, rather than put them down. Unfortunately, at this time, they are unable to take in any more unless they can adopt out the ones they currently have, since they require their own separate space away from cats that do not have it.In 2015, 4 Paws only had 28 cats euthanized (see the chart in our photo gallery!), and those cats either had terminal illnesses or were in the senior foster program. Their Asilomar rating is generally in the 96-98% range. In just the last 3 years, close to 3000 cats have been saved from euthanasia and the streets.The main challenge of a no-kill shelter is the plight of over-capacity. With people constantly dumping unwanted cats on their doorstep, and a waiting list that extends out for sometimes more than a month, 4 Paws does the best they can. Being a small, no-kill shelter means little to no state/county government funding, excessively high vet/medical costs, dwindling donations, and the difficulty to get grants due to the overabundance of rescues trying to get funding.  But we can help. YOU can help.  How?1. Donate. Support the start-up of our business so we can help our partner shelter. Our cafe will assist in fostering adoptions, as well as raise awareness to the importance of spaying/neutering your pets. Any amount will help.In our photo gallery, you can find a pie chart breaking down where exactly the funds that you donate will go to help us open!2. Adopt. Help us get more cats out of the shelters that are ready to go home, so that the shelters can better assist the cats in need of more specific care. We will host adoptions on-site thanks to the training provided to us by our partner shelter.3. Spay/Neuter. Has your pet been spayed/neutered? Kitten season happens because so many stray/feral cats are not spayed/neutered, and end up contributing to the overall population of strays/ferals by constantly reproducing. If your pet has not been spayed/neutered, please consider doing so. There are a wide variety of free/low-cost spay neuter clinics available. Reach out to us if you would like more information. All of the cats we will have available for adoption will already be spayed/neutered.4. Volunteer. Whether you would like to volunteer at Mews & Brews, or directly at Sun Cities 4 Paws, there is ample opportunity to get your hands dirty. Contact us for more information.5. Foster. If you don’t want to have cats long-term, or you’re willing to become a crazy cat lady with 22 cats living in your house with you, consider fostering. This helps open up the shelters to take in more cats. Contact us for more information.6. Want to help, but none of the above look interesting? Contact us. We will need people to help us design and build out our cafe, catify our space, make sure we’re stocked with the right materials, etc. We will do our best to find a place for any willing volunteer who wants to help us out.For more information on Feline Leukemia, see this article: http://www.peteducation.com/article.cfm?c=1+213...For more information on the effects that spaying/neutering can do for the overpopulation of ferals, specifically TNR (trap, neuter, return) programs, see this article: https://www.abqjournal.com/895490/city-tnr-cuts...For more FAQ's, visit our website FAQ's page! www.mewsandbrews.com/faqSun Cities 4 Paws Bio & Memberships4 Paws is no kill, non-profit, volunteer, tax-exempt organization.

Inventory (plants for stocking the greenhouses, coffee and pastries from High Point for the café, more of everything we currently carry, new merchandise such as home textiles, bath and body):  $15K


Outdoor seating and plant nursery: TBD (on the horizon…)

That’s a grand total of $1.2 million.  Whoa!  But, we’re 100% positive that this is a worthwhile investment. Regardless of whether or not we reach our goal, every dollar we receive during this campaign will go towards getting our doors open in time to celebrate with you this Spring.The GOODSAs a token of our gratitude, we're offering a number of perks that will only be available through this campaign.  Whether you’re in it for the coffee, or have been dying to take a design workshop with us, we’re certain that there’s something for everyone here. Need to see it with your own eyes? Check a few of these goodies out below:Postcard ($10) or 12x18 Poster ($30), photo credit: Shannon Collins Photography Smell good: our custom Flower Shop scented candle ($40), hand poured into a limited edition vessel (TBD!) by our friends at Olliver Adopt a Plant: you'll have the opportunity to choose a plant and we'll plant it up in a limited edition planter ($75) Floral trifecta: 3 months of flowers for your home  ($250) Lifeline: A year's worth of drip coffee and a special edition mug ($500)There are many more great perks of all shapes and sizes! Make sure to check them out on the right.The IMPACTCurrently, if you live in East Falls and want to purchase unique gifts for yourself or loved ones, the nearest options are to travel to Manayunk, Mt Airy, or Chestnut Hill. While we enjoy visiting, we think that East Falls deserves a retail hub of its own!  Our new location will also give Midvale Avenue a much-needed boost, bringing some fresh landscaping to break up the expanse of pavement between Chuck’s and MAT.Your contribution will also help us to keep doing what we do best.  Every year, we donate our time and money towards supporting and growing our neighborhood, working with community groups such as: East Falls Community Council, East Falls Development Corporation, the Sports Association, Historical Society, Friends of Falls Library, Friends of Laurel Hill, and many more.  This community commitment averages out to 18% of our annual profits! And you can rest easy knowing that you’re supporting a genuinely good business.  We’re a part of a growing movement of businesses around the world certified as a B-Corp. B-Corps are for-profit companies certified by the nonprofit B Lab to meet rigorous standards of social and environmental performance, accountability, and transparency. We were the first florist (in the world!) to make this commitment, striving to do what a good business should do: support our community, buy and source locally, pay our employees well, and follow high standards of sustainability.The RISKSWe’ve been doing what we do for a while now, but it doesn’t keep us from the many risks and challenges that come with this project. Investing such a large amount of money in a building and business plan the way we have is a really BIG risk! There are a lot of pieces that must fall into place perfectly for all of this to work out.  However, we’ve been doing our homework, talking to experts, and working around the clock to minimize these risks for ourselves and for you.  Two things to consider:
Starting Falls Flowers during a major economic recession was no joke. It was hard and the business lost a lot of money in the first year.  Nevertheless, persistence and a willingness to ask for help got us through those critical first years.
I have café experience! Yep, the café concept isn’t coming out of left field – I’ve spent 3 years working in cafés of different shapes and sizes, with 1 year of management experience.
Journeys like this aren’t without their share of mistakes and failures. The key to success in our particular story is that we’re ALL IN, 100% committed to doing whatever it takes to make it work.  It doesn’t hurt that we’ve cultivated a community of experts to advise and help us along the way!The WORDWhether or not you’re able to make a donation, you can help us spread the word. Use Indigogo’s share tools (up top, below our goal), use the hashtags #EastFallsIsGrowing, and #3507Midvale, and don’t forget to tag us!  We’re on Facebook and Instagram @FallsFlowers.  Tell your friends and family, neighbors and coworkers about the awesome perks they can receive for their support of a great local business. With love and gratitude,Peicha",9.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>I'm Gregory, a Frenchman who has traveled Europe and the world, passionate about other culture and their wonders. I'm married to my fantastic Italian wife Claudia. Her family comes from a small village located in the hills of the Aurunci Park, about 100km south of Rome. It is called Esperia. She has always talked to me about that village where she grew-up, the peacefulness of the place, the kindness of its' inhabitants and all these great moments she had crisscrossing an area full of <strong>stories </strong>(from the turbulent medieval times to the WW2 epic battle of Monte Cassino:<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Cassino"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Cassino</a>) and <strong>legends </strong>(Ulysse traveled the nearby waters). When going there for the first time I was hooked by the fantastic <strong>unspoiled hills</strong> where wild horses live, the <strong>kindness of the people</strong> living the area, the <strong>incredible taste of the food</strong>, the vicinity of a mind-blowing <strong>seafront</strong>. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1485334520/vggddxdehp12f60oulym.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Esperia is a village with narrow cobblestone streets and stairs, build on the flank of the mountain, under the protection of a <strong>XII century castle </strong>(<a href=""http://www.icastelli.it/it/lazio/frosinone/esperia/rocca-guglielma-di-esperia"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.icastelli.it/it/lazio/frosinone/espe...</a>). While being only few kilometers away from the Rome-Naples highway, and less than 30' drive from main cities like Cassino and Gaeta/Formia, the village slowly slowly loses its' appeal to families. The few local shops struggle to stay open. Still, the locals are really bind to their community, their history and put a lot of effort in <strong>keeping their traditions alive. </strong>One of these traditions is the <strong>infiorata</strong>, a religious celebration during which tapestries made up of petals are realised in the streets (<a href=""http://www.diocesisora.it/pdigitale/clicca-linfiorata-esperia"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.diocesisora.it/pdigitale/clicca-linf...</a>). Other celebration include the local summer festivals like the Festa dei Vicoli (<a href=""https://youtu.be/sXalsLF2okE"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://youtu.be/sXalsLF2okE</a>). The local council also invests a lot in their local museum, the refurbishment of old city quarters and just created the infrastructure around the newly found <strong>dinosaurs footprints </strong>(see below picture). The village is also ideally located for visiting the famous Monte Cassino Abbey, the ancient city of Gaeta (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaeta"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaeta</a>) with its old fish markets natural sea grotto (<a href=""http://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g187790-d8514215-Reviews-Grotta_Del_Turco-Gaeta_Province_of_Latina_Lazio.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g187790-d...</a>) , its' medieval cathedral and also for day trips to the Royal Palace of Caserta (<a href=""http://reggiaofcaserta.altervista.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://reggiaofcaserta.altervista.org</a>), the Amalfi coast (<a href=""http://www.amalficoast.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.amalficoast.com</a>) or Pompei (<a href=""http://www.britannica.com/place/Pompeii"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.britannica.com/place/Pompeii</a>).</p>

<p>The efforts made by the Esperian community are not really visible to tourists and their visit is not made easier considering the limited accommodation options the village has to propose.  Our love for this community, the richness of what it can propose fueled us to make this project of transforming an old <strong>traditional 300sqm house into a vacation home</strong> for whoever in search for peaceful and unspoiled places. This vacation home would accommodate easily <strong>10 to 15 people</strong> with its' 4 bedrooms, 2 living rooms and 4 bathrooms. By having regular visitors in Esperia we would support the local businesses and also help uncover an area easily reachable from the international Rome airport. The house has just been bought with the idea of the vacation house in mind and it is even more meaningful to us as it was a house where my wife has spent a part of her childhood.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1485421293/nr6k46szhtckp2legtft.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><strong>Our project</strong> is not only about repairing a house and refresh it back to the level of comfortable and modern facilities, but also to improve the village touristic capacity and foremost help visitors getting in touch with the local community.<strong> The work will be performed by local builders, plumbers and electricians to support local economy</strong>. In parallel we will build privileged connection with the local authorities, shops, restaurants and artists in order to involve each and everyone in welcoming our visitors.  </p>
<p>In order to be able to welcome visitors, the house would need a <strong>full renovation from house wiring, plumbing, heating system, insulation as well as some building upgrades</strong>. The workload is quite important and would mean activity for the local workmanship for some months. Although this could be performed step by step, a slow-pace upgrade would postpone the opening of the house to tourists. The <strong>impact </strong>from your contribution would mean giving a <strong>decisive boost to this community</strong> in terms of short term building activity. The second long term effect, welcoming tourists and visitors, is foreseen to start by end of spring 2017. Their arrival would give another support to the local community.     </p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The impact of such project is huge on small communities. First, <strong>making sure local manpower is working</strong> gives it more reasons to believe that the living locally is sustainable and helps the community being alive.

<p>My wife and I are used to dealing with activities that require planning and organizing work with contractors and founding funds to finance these works, although our careers are focused on high technology activities. We have personally invested in smaller project in northern Latium in the beautifully renovated village of Salisano where we have bought and renovated a 50sqm house. After replacing the roof, upgrading the heating and electrical system the house was lend to a person who wanted to leave the stress of a capital city and integrate a small and quiet community. The experiment has been a success!    </p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Restoring a house can obviously face lots of hurdles but let's say it can always be overcome. We have renovated several houses and we think that options can often be found.

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Short Summary<br/>(for paypal donation send to: filipehvinhas@hotmail.com)</h3>
<p>The community is already built. So, there are a lot of people ready to jump in when this project is ready. You may be asking why they don’t fund us. Well in Portugal the minimal wage barely pays your bills, also most of our community are students, so most people can't help because of the expenses with college and basic needs.</p>
<p>The location is on one of the most beautiful cities of the north Portugal, Aveiro, known as the Portuguese Venice. Due to have train terminal and relatively new highways this city seems to us a perfect location not only because of its accessibility, but also sunny and warm weather, and its great views, touristic sites and beaches (just in case we get tired from gaming).</p>
<p>We already have all the consoles that we need, this includes PS2, PS3, PS4, Xbox 360, Wii, PC. But we are struggling to pay the furniture and the TVs.</p>
</div><div>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Half of the money will be mainly used to get the furniture that we need and the electronic equipment. </p>
<p>To be more precise, around 30 chairs, 10 bean bags, 10 tables, surround sound system, 10 televisions or monitors, 5 shelfs, fridge, customizable wall mural, 1 video projector1, a bar counter, pinball machine and a air hockey table. <br/><br/>The remaining will be used to paint the walls, create a small food and drinks stock, install wi-fi and save some funds  as a reward for future tournaments.</p>
<p><br/>The rewards are the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">The Impact</h3>
<p>This will be an amazing spot, for geeks, gamers and otakus to meet. There isn’t much around to do. Portugal is still in a stone age when we think about entertainment. We just want to create a great place for people to hang out, have fun, chill, relax, maybe meet the ""gamer girl"" of their dreams, who knows! If you have the same geek heart as we do, you'll understand how awesome this will be. You are probably from a foreign country and may not visit it, but you'll feel great making our project come true.</p>
</div><div>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Well, to be honest, the only challenge we must face so far is the lack of money to start up; Buying the equipment and furniture needed. Other than that, we have the project all planed and ready to go. There are no risks, since we are ready to support this even if it’s not profitable, but self-sustainable.</p>
</div><div>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Even if you can’t support us financially, would be amazing if you could share this to your friends and family, maybe someone doesn’t mind helping :D</p>
</div></div>","Short Summary(for paypal donation send to: filipehvinhas@hotmail.com)
The community is already built. So, there are a lot of people ready to jump in when this project is ready. You may be asking why they don’t fund us. Well in Portugal the minimal wage barely pays your bills, also most of our community are students, so most people can't help because of the expenses with college and basic needs.
The location is on one of the most beautiful cities of the north Portugal, Aveiro, known as the Portuguese Venice. Due to have train terminal and relatively new highways this city seems to us a perfect location not only because of its accessibility, but also sunny and warm weather, and its great views, touristic sites and beaches (just in case we get tired from gaming).
We already have all the consoles that we need, this includes PS2, PS3, PS4, Xbox 360, Wii, PC. But we are struggling to pay the furniture and the TVs.

What We Need & What You Get
Half of the money will be mainly used to get the furniture that we need and the electronic equipment. 
To be more precise, around 30 chairs, 10 bean bags, 10 tables, surround sound system, 10 televisions or monitors, 5 shelfs, fridge, customizable wall mural, 1 video projector1, a bar counter, pinball machine and a air hockey table. The remaining will be used to paint the walls, create a small food and drinks stock, install wi-fi and save some funds  as a reward for future tournaments.
The rewards are the following:


1€ - A special and unique video, to each donator, showing our gratitude. You can choose the gender of the person doing it. 

5€​ - You will receive a deadpool keychain. Also we do some photoshoots over the year, we can give you full acess to them, usually most cosplayers are girls. 


10€​ - Get a League of Legends Teemo cosplay hat.

<p>My name is Tiffany Richardson and i'm a US Navy Veteran and soon to be college graduate majoring in Business Administration. I've always had a passion for hair but not until recently understood the disconnect between beauty supply stores and consumers. Utilizing what I've learned in school, I began to think of ways I could possible begin to change this disparity, of very few Black owned Beauty Supply stores in my area and the country. I began to connect with resources throughout my community to see if it was possible for me to open my own store. It was like opening the flood gates as i dove more into the history of the beauty supply industry and just how blind i was to what was going on. I researched for days until one day I thought, why can't I open my own Beauty Supply Store...that's mobile! </p>
<p>This is our first fundraiser. The vision I have for our business is something I would've never thought was possible for me to achieve. This fundraiser will be the first stepping stone to making this store more than just a beauty supply business. I would like there to be periodical events hosted by Headz Up Beauty Supply that focus on educating women about their hair and the products they put in it as well as DIY sessions that show women how to maintain their hair while in certain styles. Instead of just selling products to the consumer, I would like the customer to know that we are genuinely interested in knowing you AND your hair journey. </p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p> We are proud to be a Veteran/Woman/Black Owned business in Hampton Roads and we're honored to share this experience with you. Unfortunately, there aren't a whole lot of financial opportunities for start up businesses such as ours, so that's where you come in! </p>
<p>Your donations will go towards purchasing inventory, basic marketing, and the purchase of the truck, which will be our<strong> mobile store</strong>. We want to ensure that everyone understands that we realize what a huge industry this is and that success doesn't come overnight. This is exactly why we follow our motto, the 3 S's: <strong><i>Stay Focused, Start Small, and Seek Stability</i></strong>. We understand that as a small and new business, we can't do everything we want all at once. This is why we are currently focusing on building inventory to shorten shipping time, consistently performing market research to keep up on our competition, advertising our business daily through social media, flyers, and word of mouth, and continuing to stay on top of new trends and products in the beauty supply and hair industry. </p>
<p>Your contributions mean more to us than you know, SO when you make a donation,at the end of the campaign we will send you a gift!

The revolutionary shift prevention design was developed by a narcoleptic to optimize quality of sleep.

The most recommended approach is to outsource manufacturing and operate akin to a retailer or wholesaler.  That approach does not sit well with the OmniSom Pillow team for several reasons, but first and foremost because the lack of control over the sources of materials and practices of production facilities results in just another mass produced, environmentally irresponsible driver for inhumane labor conditions.

This is incredibly high risk due to the lack of operational funding beyond the first month.  Two risk mitigating factors to consider; an anticipated exclusive supplier contract with an international retailer and blind faith in the power of consumers for good.

<p>For the past decade, Peace Boat US, a non-profit organization based in New York, has developed strong ties of friendship and support with a Kuna indigenous community in Panama that is struggling to keep its 960 members safe from preventable diseases and accidents without external support.</p>
<p>This October, in concert with Peace Boat US’ Music &amp; Art Peace Academy (MAPA), and four other amazing non-profit organizations: Universal Models for Peace, Mythic Bridge, Parties4Peace, and Downtown Community Television (DCTV), we will not only help the community with its sustainable development goals, we will also give inner city youth from New York the opportunity to travel to the community and make a documentary about their experiences. The youth will also have the opportunity to sail with Peace Boat’s 88th Global Voyage between Mexico and Panama (October 24-29, 2015), and take part in study programs, cultural exchanges, educational workshops  and videography training while onboard.</p>
<p>Peace Boat visits Panama every year, and in 2014 the leader of the Kuna indigenous community requested international support for their community to improve its living conditions. Knowing well the incredible diligence of this community, we immediately agreed, and are currently helping them seek funds for the construction materials they need to build a better septic system and safe pathway.</p>
<p>We’ll do the work of organizing this program, but we need your contribution to see it through. Please join us in fostering sustainable development, international friendship and cooperation, and support for inner city youth who otherwise would not be able to travel and study overseas!</p>
</div><div>
<p></p> </div> <div> <h3>Our plan to visit the Kuna indigenous community</h3> <p></p>
<p>Late October will be our next trip to Panama to visit the Kuna community and we would love to make a big impact ! Our aim is to raise at least $5,000 before our next trip so that we can purchase the materials needed to build lavatories, septic tanks, sustainable water sources, and safe sidewalks. The entire process will be documented by two participants funded by the Music &amp; Art Peace Academy (MAPA). </p> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p></p>
</div>
<p>We cannot help the Kuna people without you! Even $10 will go a long way in collecting the necessary materials we need for the construction of the improved toilets and sidewalks in the community. We believe that everyone should have basic resources and healthy living conditions. A successful campaign will show other organizations, as well as the communities we are supporting, that international cooperation and grassroots fundraising efforts can support local sustainable development.  </p>
<p><b>Thank you for all your help!</b></p><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>We have been visiting the Kuna indigenous community for more than 10 years and we have a great relationship with the leaders of the village. It is always a challenge to do enough when we visit, so we would like to bring as much support as we can during this visit on October 29-30th to support their sustainable development projects including the construction of a community toilet, safe sidewalks and materials for their fair trade clothing program. </p>

The entire process will be documented by two participants funded by the Music & Art Peace Academy (MAPA).    The Impact 

We cannot help the Kuna people without you! Even $10 will go a long way in collecting the necessary materials we need for the construction of the improved toilets and sidewalks in the community. We believe that everyone should have basic resources and healthy living conditions. A successful campaign will show other organizations, as well as the communities we are supporting, that international cooperation and grassroots fundraising efforts can support local sustainable development.  
Thank you for all your help!
Risks & Challenges We have been visiting the Kuna indigenous community for more than 10 years and we have a great relationship with the leaders of the village. It is always a challenge to do enough when we visit, so we would like to bring as much support as we can during this visit on October 29-30th to support their sustainable development projects including the construction of a community toilet, safe sidewalks and materials for their fair trade clothing program.
