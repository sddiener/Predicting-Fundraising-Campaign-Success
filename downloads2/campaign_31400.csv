<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>We are asking for people to help us to save our home. We have 3 generations living in this home. We have my wife and I, my in-laws, and our 5 children, ages 3 to 16. Before I met my wife, my mother-in-law would take care of hospice patients in the spare bedroom. A little over two years ago, the last patient passed away, and my mother-in-law also lost her job. Between both losses, a lot of income was lost. With the housing market the way it is, the government was talking about how they were creating programs for people who had a loss of income and were upside down in their mortgages. The programs were to help people obtain a modification on their home loan through their bank. My in-laws applied for a modification and were turned down. After being turned down, they hired an attorney. Since then, they have been fighting with the bank every step of the way trying to save the home. With the money that we have not used to pay for the mortgage, we paid off vehicles and other bills, and paid the attorney fees. The other day, we called the bank’s loan service officer handling our case and she told us that the only way we would be guaranteed to be able to save our home was to pay the entire amount that is behind. That is almost $40,000. She mentioned that if we wanted to pay half of that, they would submit us for a program that might let us keep the home. She stressed the word “might,” saying that if we give them $20,000, they may still proceed with the foreclosure anyway. We do not want to lose what we have here. We want to fight to keep the house.</p>
<p>I have already told you a little about my mother-in-law. My father-in-law has been retired for a long time and is getting up there in age. My wife has two medical conditions that leave her to where she is unable to work. Trust me; she would want to work if she could. As far as I am concerned, I have worked my entire life until last year. I spent time in the Army, then the last 9 ½ years that I worked, I was a deputy. I had a car accident a few years ago, and due to the injuries, I have had two back surgeries that have failed. I am in need of another back surgery, but it is highly unlikely that another surgery would help. So far, I have tried a lot of different pain medications that have not provided any relief for the pain yet. My doctor is going down the list that the insurance will cover, and hopefully they will finally find one that helps lower the amount of agony I am in. I spend most of my day either in my recliner, or lying in bed. It’s hard to believe that if I sit too long, it increases the pain. Lying down is the only thing that helps to lower the pain some. I have filed for social security disability. I was denied twice so far, and I am waiting for a court hearing. My attorney said that with my injuries, once I make it to court, the judge will award the disability. If we can get the help to save our home, once my disability comes through, we will be in a financial position to maintain the payments.</p>
<p>If we are unable to save our home, then any donations you have provided will assist us in finding a new home to move into. We thank you all for your help. We are asking people to not look at the big number. Please just give what you feel comfortable giving, and more importantly, please; just share our link so that others can help. If we could get a lot of people to donate a simple $5 or $10, then the grand total will build quickly.</p>
<p><strong>Remember, no donation is too small. Even if everyone was only able to pay $5, we would be able to reach our goal if we can get enough people to make that small donation.</strong></p>
<p>What good is it, my brothers, if someone says he has faith but does not have works? Can that faith save him? If a brother or sister is poorly clothed and lacking in daily food, and one of you says to them, “Go in peace, be warmed and filled,” without giving them the things needed for the body, what good is that? So also faith by itself, if it does not have works, is dead. James 2:14-17</p>
<p>Bear one another's burdens, and so fulfill the law of Christ. Galatians 6:2</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>In order to save our home and not have to worry again, it will take $60,000. I know that is a lot, but this will get us caught up, and pay a few months until my social security disabilty can get approved.</p>

<li>We are a family of 9 living in the home. Two grand parents, Two parents, and five children. The youngest is 3 and the oldest is 16. 4 are girls, and our only son is intellectually disabled and has asperber's syndrome, a form of autism. Your funding will help to make sure that our wonderful children do not end up homeless.</li>
<li>If we do not receive enough funding to save our home, then the funding that we do receive will help us to find somewhere else to live that will accomodate our large family, hopefully long enough to allow for my disability to be approved.</li>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Your contributions will help to keep one large family from becomng homeless. You will be providing a secure environment for children to grow up. You will be giving all of of peace of mind, and reducing our daily stress level tremendously.</p>

<li>If we do not raise enough money to save our home, your contributions will at least help us to find another residence that will work for our family. The main goal is to find a way for us to stay off the streets and keep our kids safe.</li>

<li>If you are unable to help, thank you for looking at our campain anyways. You can still help by contacting your legislators and having them press laws that pressure the banks to modify mortgages for people who want to keep their homes. We are hearing a lot of hype about programs the help people keep their homes, but the banks are not required to abide by those programs. Most banks are choosing not to work with the government programs and are choosing to proceed with foreclosures regardless of the outcome of the families that they are displacing. A good example is our sitation so far. In September of 2011, we had a court ordered mediation scheduled. We showed up with our attorney and the mediator was there, but the Attorney for the bank did not show up, and they are still proceeding with the forclosure process.</li>

What We Need & What You Get
In order to save our home and not have to worry again, it will take $60,000. I know that is a lot, but this will get us caught up, and pay a few months until my social security disabilty can get approved.

We are a family of 9 living in the home. Two grand parents, Two parents, and five children. The youngest is 3 and the oldest is 16. 4 are girls, and our only son is intellectually disabled and has asperber's syndrome, a form of autism. Your funding will help to make sure that our wonderful children do not end up homeless.
If we do not receive enough funding to save our home, then the funding that we do receive will help us to find somewhere else to live that will accomodate our large family, hopefully long enough to allow for my disability to be approved.



The Impact
Your contributions will help to keep one large family from becomng homeless. You will be providing a secure environment for children to grow up. You will be giving all of of peace of mind, and reducing our daily stress level tremendously.

If we do not raise enough money to save our home, your contributions will at least help us to find another residence that will work for our family. The main goal is to find a way for us to stay off the streets and keep our kids safe.



Other Ways You Can Help
Some people just can’t contribute, but that doesn’t mean they can’t help:



If you are unable to help, thank you for looking at our campain anyways. You can still help by contacting your legislators and having them press laws that pressure the banks to modify mortgages for people who want to keep their homes.

“help them help themselves.”  The focus
of our trip is community empowerment and sustainable lifestyle through
education.  With this focus we will be
working on four projects while we are there.  We have two work times allocated during the
week: the morning session and the afternoon session.  </p>
<p></p><p> The school group
stays with the kids.  With the school we
teach English to the children.  One of
the largest industries in India is tourism, therefore preparing these kids with
a foundation of English we can help prepare them for opportunities for work in
the future.  There are different levels
and we will break the kids up into their respective levels.  Teachers are there but we would be taking
over the class for those two weeks for a more intensive English camp.  Having the teachers there is very helpful
however because they can act as a translator at times.*</p>
<p>The woman’s group walks a short distance to the sewing
facility which is based out of a very small house.  Women come here who are often recovering from
domestic violence and abusive relationships. 
Here they learn how to sew which is a great skill to make clothes for
their family and have the possibility to sell these clothes for profit.  Our group works with the women to teach basic
entrepreneurship skills and woman’s empowerment.  We will work with them individually to help
find their identity as a woman and feel significant as a person.  Last year we got a great response from these
women and this year we plan to help them sew pants and actually sell the pants
themselves for profit.*  </p>

The men’s group was a project we started last
year.  A large issue in these communities
for poverty is that many of the men turn to gambling and alcoholism and cannot
support their family.  We gathered the
group of men in the community who are no longer in school but have not yet
started a family.  We created this group
in order to teach them the importance of sustainable living.  We have also introduced the idea for them to
form their own volunteer projects.  This
will create a great ideal in the community. <br/><p></p><p></p></div>","Alternative Winter Break IndiaHello,My name is David Mandell and I am the coordinator for the USC Alternative Winter Break Trip to India.  We are taking 20 students to the slums. Our main goal while working in the slum is the idea to

<h3>Even donating 1 Euro only, you will give a great boost to my campaign!</h3>Thank you everyone</div></div>","Dr. Sara CampolonghiWho I amI am an enthusiastic Psychologist, Heathy food Coach, Trainer, Educator, and Teacher of Italian Language for Foreigners. I am an expert on Eating and life-style behaviours, obesity and related diseases and National Secretary of ASAS, Italian Association for Health.Look at my website www.coachalimentare.it (Italian only, for now!)
What I do for people
Seven years ago, as a Clinical and health psychologist, I linked together my competences in Healthy Eating, Psychology and Coaching, in order to help people change the wrong habits and lose weight definitely, and fill the gap existing between the dietologists' and nutritionists' prescriptions, that is, knowledge and theoretical advice about what everyone should do or eat to lose weight and stay healthy, and the effective and concrete change of behavior, habits, knowledge and awareness about food, eating, exercise, every aspect of the daily routine management that really allow people to enjoy good health, lose and maintain their body-weight without efforts and staying healthy steadily.Usually doctors simply prescribe people diets to follow, but food is strictly connected with people's lives, culture or stories, personal taste, opinions, their personal and social world. On the other hand, psychologists are often focused on feelings or motivation only, without taking into account how bad food and wrong habits can influence brain, mental processes and behaviour.But when peolpe go back home, living the daily routine, it is impossible for them to keep a strict diet forever, maintain a stable weight and a good and balanced and satisfying relation with food or their own body, and change their wrong habits just working on feelings.  People rather need a guide who can help them change the previous unhealthy routine with a different one they are not used to, proceeding step by step, and discovering that it is much easier than expected.They need practical advice to know for instance how to buy groceries consciously or read lables correctly, how to combine different food in a meal or cook a particular vegetable or beans, what are the best choises in a restaurant's menu. Peolple also need to understand the reasons of their desire for some kind of food, to distinguish the right signals of hunger and fullness, improve their organization skills to settle the lunch at work, outdoor, with family. 
And much more.
My mission
This is my job, and my purpose: make people conscious and independent about their daily routines and weight management; allow them to improve their knowledge and practical skills about food, cooking and activity, eating behavior and emotions, connections between brain and body signals, etc.; make them curious, happy and satisfied, learning and doing things to improve their own well-being and health by themselves everyday.
What's more, I am working hard to change the attitude of people and the common culture about food and nutrition, in order to modify the way people and families choose their nourishment every day.
All this, definitely enhances the quality of life of people.


What I look for

At present, I feel the need to improve my competences moving to a place where prevention and promotion of health are very important and practised, and doctors and psychologists usually work together in team in order to pursue it effectively. Australia is the right place, actually.


Furthermore, this one-year Master of Science in Coaching Psychology at the University of Sydney seems to have been made especially for me. It matches precisely my profession and interests and I am sure it is the right way to improve my competence, and go ahead in my mission about promotion of health. 

Unfortunately, I don't have the possibilities to pay for this Master nor to move to Sydney for one year because of the high cost of living.
What I need

This one-year Master, starting on May 2015, costs 36,800.00 AUD (more than 26.500,00 Euros). 


You can find more details here: http://sydney.edu.au/courses/master-of-science-in-coaching-psychology). 


I need help to pay living costs (house rent, food, transports etc.)much higher in Australia than in Italy, as long as I find a part time job there.


Moreover, University will ask me probably to attend a mandatory and expensive English course before the Master: even a 7.5 Academic IELTS score is required! I've got a good 7.0 overall, enough to be accepted, but only with a conditional offer.

In case I won't reach the entire goal...
I will use the funds collected to try to start a PhD in Health at the University of Queensland, Brisbane. 
In fact, there is a great Professor at the University of Queensland who is working on good Parenting and Children's overweight. I had the possibility to start a PhD with him last year but unfortunately I didn't get the scholarship because of extremely competitive, and I couldn't go. With your donations I could start to work with him and try to get the scholarship again with many more chances.
I will appreciate every donation you will give me, because this means you trust in my purpose as much as me.

Even donating 1 Euro only, you will give a great boost to my campaign!

ABOUT ME


Some opinions and experiences of patients, colleagues and friends.




Francesco, Graduated in International Relations. 24
""I met Sara Campolonghi three years ago, when I had already started to modify my diet by myself, since I wanted to lose some weight. Yet in a few talks she completely changed my way of looking at alimentation: she explained me the qualities of different kinds of food, the health risks of certain industrial products - some of which are very popular - and, what counts the most, she suggested me how and even where to easily get healthy food in a metropolitan area such as Rome.  Moreover, thanks to Sara's advice, I am now able to cook my dishes in a healthier way, but as tasty as before: for example, by using spices in place of salt, or by introducing certain vegetables. 
Furthermore, being a psychologist, Sara applies a 'soft' approach in her job, which fosters cooperation from the patient in changing his lifestyle. Last but not least, she takes full advantage of social networking, by publishing useful tips for a good diet on a daily basis. I personally consider that modern Western society, with its obesity rate and poor alimentary education, needs higher numbers of such a professional figure.""
Domenico Tiso, MD, President of ASAS Italian Association for Health.
""Dr. Sara Campolonghi is a trained person, accurate and reliable. What strikes me about her, in particular, is the passion and motivation which she tackles any project and initiative with. I consider her prone to listening and proactivity, and cut out for teamwork. I personally believe that Dr. Sara Campolonghi is a very earnest and responsible person, she can be a virtuous resource in any context.""
Andrea, Student, film-maker and actor. 23
""I didn't expect I could appreciate so much such a different eating style and healthier food, unlike what I was used to, and lose weight at the same time. Thanks to Sara now I am more aware and careful about what I put in my mouth and my body, I am feeling much better and losing weight without sacrifices. I will go on, definitely!""
Fabiana, Make-up artist. 33
""I met Sara a long time ago and I appreciate her both as a friend and as a professionist. She helped me live my coeliac disease not as a limit, but as a possibility for a different and healthy eating, and I'm really experiencing this change now, during my pregnancy. I absolutely have no cravings for junk food, and my eyes shine only for fruit and vegetables!""


Stefano, Lawyer and Conductor. 38
I was managing my daily life badly, and I was frequently ill in the past. Dr. Campolonghi has really helped me:  since I took advice from her, I started and learned to eat more consciously, and doing excercise with plasure; my daily habits are changed and I have lost weight gradually. I am a different person now, healthier and happier than before.""



Clarissa, Child care Center Teacher. 32

""I attended one of Dr. Campolonghi's speeches last year during an interesting big congress about healthy lifestyle, that she organised with her association Asas for Health in Piacenza. Her talk about the importance of a healthy eating was so engaging that it gave a great boost to my desire for change. 
Her inspiring words made me understand how what we eat affects us and our health, and that the only way of changing our life and eating style is our inner willing of doing that.""

Micaela, Employee. 42
""I began this path with Dr. Campolonghi getting practical guidelines, that could leave out problems due to bad nutrition. Then we started analysing automatic behaviours, emotions and states of mind that influenced the way I looked at and judged myself.Not a diet, but a way to recover ourselves and our freedom!""


Isabella, Secretary. 52
""I tried lots of diets. I usually was so nervous, frustrated, I wanted to quit... but since I met Dr. Campolonghi, talking and working with her, I'm actually seeing things clearly, and everything becomes easier to do. I don't feel guilty or ashamed anymore because now I know  I am not failing but changing my habits progressively, step by step, enjoying the achievements and working on the next aims. With her I can see the way to handle problems and difficulties with confidence and more peacefully. She makes me feel good.""

Ignazia, Employee. 49

""Before I met Dr. Campolonghi, I had tried to lose weight but with poor results, I take lots of cortisone and for me it is not easy to lose weight ... in nearly two months of ""non-diet"" but healthy eating, I lost almost 6 pounds, what makes me happiest is that my blood analysis have been getting better, and I have reduced the dose of cortisone! There is still much to be done but I am determined to continue my experience with my health coach and the healthy eating""
""I am very glad I met you, Dr. Campolonghi, I am not an outgoing person, I  am not  good with words, but I like you very much not only as a professionist, but also as a person.""

Maria Cecilia, Lowyer. 60
""Dr. Campolonghi is the only person who succeeded- with cheerfulness and perseverance - in dismantling my armor, making me able to see myself and the world I live in more realistically and allowing me to think that I can change and improve my life, in all fields.""

<p>Bikram yoga is a series of 26 Hatha yoga poses practiced in a room heated to 41 degrees at humidity levels of 105 degrees. Why the heat? 41 degrees is the temperature the body reaches when exercising, maintaining this temperature in a 90 minute class allows the body to work safely through stretching and muscle strengthening. There are really positive reasons why this yoga is popular with athletes and dancers but more importantly anyone can do it. I talk about Bikram alot and have shared this yoga with so many friends and its a delight for me to see them improving their health with this practice. I want to bring this yoga to my local community, it all starts with me.</p>
<p>Bikram yoga teachers train with Bikram at his yoga college in LA, the nine week course is an intensive, six days a week sixteen hours a day, immersion in the ethos and details of the practice. The teaching method is uniform and the standards are high. Wherever in the word that you attend a Bikram class, the routine will not deviate from the 26 postures, the series has been designed with intent and all Bikram teachers are certified by Bikram.</p>

<p><strong>*UPDATE 16/08</strong></p>
<p>The good news is that i've been given a place although i haven't been awarded a scholarship.</p>
<p>September is the final teaching programme of 2012, the course dates are 16th September - 18th November, the fees for this session are $10'900 this covers fees and lodgings at the Radisson LAX in Los Angeles, it is mandatory to stay here for the length of the training and living expenses are not included. The fees for Bikram Teacher Training are beyond the budget of anyone that I help and i have applied for a scholarship. The deadline for scholarship announcements has been pushed back from July to August 15th after which unsuccessful candidates are allowed a further two weeks to raise funds for the course. If i am not successful in either receiving a scholarship or meeting my funding target any funds raised will roll forward to apply to next year's session which will be in April 2013 at a higher cost. Any funds i raise above my target will roll forward to Phase II- opening a bikram yoga studio.</p>
<p>My funding target is $17500. Indiegogo will levy a commission on all donations and I have alowed for the lack of a scholarship, living expenses and flights. Donations can be made in GB£, US$ and Euros and are recieived in to s secure PayPal account. All donations will be transfered to me on 11th September.</p>

I am looking at raising 9,000 Euros (11,000 USD) for my first year.
By helping me, you are helping to improve the welfare of the slum community - Viwandani – where I am from. I dedicate my life to improving the quality of life of my home and my community.

<p>Hi, this
is Yumi Kuwana writing on behalf of Global Citizens Initiative (GCI). This summer in 2014, we
are hosting a Global Citizens Summit for Youth (GCSY) at the Harvard Faculty Club. The
summit will bring twenty-four 16-18 year olds together to discuss the
potential for global citizenship and the themes of ""freedom and
fairness"" in the world today. The summit will be led by veteran professors
from the Phillips Exeter Academy. We are looking for financial support to
bring talented youth from modest economic backgrounds to the
summit. We are also in the process of purchasing an online platform which will
allow students to stay connected with each other and with their mentors with video-conferencing throughout
the year. In this way, the program at Harvard will act as a springboard for
these young leaders. Through the ""C4 Leadership principles"" of Collaboration, Creation, Character, and Critical thought, we plan to instill values of positive
citizenship throughout the world, and to spark initiatives led by students when
they return home. This will allow our GCI youth to take action and follow their
passion in this ever increasing globalized and digitalized world. I hope you
will join me in making this summit a reality. </p>
<p><b>What We Need &amp; What You Get</b></p>
<ul>
<li>We are looking to support
     five scholarships for the program. This will amount to $6,700 per student, including international airfare. In addition, we will need $5,000
     for subscriptions to online language and curriculum content, as well as
     $11,500 to cover the teaching expenses and programming costs of
     maintaining the program in the coming year. </li>

network formed at the summit, connected by a virtual platform which your contributions will help support. On the

(conducted by a Harvard Graduate School of Education doctoral researcher) will
be used to analyze which aspects of the summit can be scaled and applied to

Because of Princess Ten Ten’s gender non-conformity, she is bullied by other children and even her own father rejects her. </p><p>This story reveals how Princess Ten Ten <b>perseveres</b> and becomes a superheroine. She earns the title Guardian of the Skies by tackling the problem of air pollution.

</div></div>","The Guardian PrincessesThe Guardian Princesses are new superheroines who work together to protect the people and the planet.  They are a group of racially and culturally diverse leaders who model compassion and intelligence, as well as the power of knowledge and collective action. Our stories transform the cultural meaning of the princess from a damsel-in-distress to brave heroines providing better role models for all children. Princess Ten Ten, Guardian of the SkiesWith your help, we will publish the fourth story of the series: Princess Ten Ten & The Dark Skies. This first-ever gender independent princess defies the gender norms of her culture; she refuses to wear dresses, has short messy hair, and practices a martial art that has traditionally been exclusively for boys. Because of Princess Ten Ten’s gender non-conformity, she is bullied by other children and even her own father rejects her. This story reveals how Princess Ten Ten perseveres and becomes a superheroine. She earns the title Guardian of the Skies by tackling the problem of air pollution. While raising awareness about the global impact of fossil fuel dependent economies, this story teaches readers about East Asian cultures. This story brings together Chinese, Japanese, and Korean cultures since they are all part of her mixed-heritage.  How You Can HelpParticipate in our Princess Ten Ten launch campaign from 10/10 to 11/20 and receive a great package of merchandise, perfect for holiday gifts!

Each princess is a guardian of one element of the environment. These heroines work together modeling cross-racial cooperation and the power of collective action. Guardian Princess books offer beautifully illustrated stories that emphasize the development of children’s talents, knowledge about the world, and each story includes educational supplements, like a glossary and discussion questions.

How It All Began
The Guardian Princess Alliance is a movement that started with a mother… 
Setsu Shigematsu, Associate Professor in the Media and Cultural Studies Department of University of California, Riverside, became concerned with today’s overwhelming princess culture because of its primary focus on external beauty and the way this is marketed to children. She witnessed its appeal to her own young daughter, a fascination that only seemed to grow when Setsu refused to purchase any princess products.
Rather than reject this powerful culture altogether, Setsu decided to write a story to positively transform the cultural meaning of the princess. The first story of the Guardian Princess series, Princess Terra and King Abaddon was written for her daughter’s fifth birthday. Since then, the movement has grown into a diverse group of parents, educators, students, artists, and professionals who are committed to creating better role models for children, thusly forming the Guardian Princess Alliance.

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>Hi. My name is Talicia and I am raising money to fund my daughter's trip to NYC for the Finale National Show Choir competition. She is part of the JBHS Tech Crew which does lights and sound for all high school productions including our award winning Powerhouse show choir concerts and competitions.</p>
<p>Recently, I went on unpaid medical leave due to an injury and loss my job the day I returned to work. Because of this and the holiday, we are having a hard time funding her trip on our own.  I have already paid for more than half the trip personally and would appreciate any help you could give to pay the remaining balance. Even dollars add up.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>My daughter loves being part of something bigger than herself. Since joining tech crew, she is learning skills that she will use the rest of her life. My daughter would be devastated if she suddenly could not participate in this incredible opportunity with her school because of this series of unfortunate events. To see her not be able to attend this trip with her class will break my heart. <br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need to raise $600 by February 29th, 2012, for her to attend. </p>
<p>The total cost for the trip is $1500. This cost covers: Round trip Airfare, Transportation to &amp; from airport to hotel and venues, a weekly subway pass, Entrance to Competition with Dinner included, A Boadway Show, Entrance to <span class=""yshortcuts"" id=""lw_1323208553_2"">Ground Zero</span> Memorial Tour, 4 night room (shared with 4-5 students), Lunch provided on rehearsal day, Food allowance for student 3 meals a day for 5 days.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>You get the satisfaction of knowing you help a teenage girl follow her dreams of going to the city she plans on attending college in and competing in National Show Choir Competition and a thank you letter from Raima for any contribution. For contributions of $20 or more, she will use her fabulous photography skills and send you a signed print to hang on the wall of your home or office. :)</p>

The 17 week long voyage begins in St. Thomas, USVI and concludes in Bar Harbor. During the trip students learn how to maintain and eventually become deck hands on the 131 foot Harvey Gamage while also studying five rigorous academic courses: Navigation/Seamanship, Marine Science, Marine Applied Mathematics, Maritime History, and Maritime Literature. As a result of having courses that are relevant and integrated with the voyage, what is learned in academic studies can be easily applied to life aboard the ship.</p>
<p>I want to take the spring semester to do the Ocean Classroom Discovery High School trip because the voyage is an incredibly unique opportunity to study subjects that I am interested in, while at the same time having a fantastic and a potentially life-changing experience.</p>

I'm a senior at Stissing Mountain High School and my dream is to go on a road trip across this beautiful country.  If you have read this far let me tell you a little about who you're funding. I grew up in a small little farm town  called Stanfordville NY where everyone has known each other since they were in elementary school. My closest friends: Robert Schuyler, Katherine Gale and Brandan Maisonet  and I became close after the loss of our friends Gian Stagnaro and Zach Pruner to a fatal car accident back in 2013. Ever since then we have believed in the saying ""Live Life to the Fullest"" Rob's a complete genius, a huge Beatles fan, and is a wiz with computers. Katherine is an environmentalist, a photographer and a fantastic self taught piano player and Brandan is the handy man, cook and mechanic. You can give him anything and he'll find a way to fix it.

I'm a senior at Stissing Mountain High School and my dream is to go on a road trip across this beautiful country.  If you have read this far let me tell you a little about who you're funding. I grew up in a small little farm town  called Stanfordville NY where everyone has known each other since they were in elementary school. My closest friends: Robert Schuyler, Katherine Gale and Brandan Maisonet  and I became close after the loss of our friends Gian Stagnaro and Zach Pruner to a fatal car accident back in 2013. Ever since then we have believed in the saying ""Live Life to the Fullest"" Rob's a complete genius, a huge Beatles fan, and is a wiz with computers. Katherine is an environmentalist, a photographer and a fantastic self taught piano player and Brandan is the handy man, cook and mechanic. You can give him anything and he'll find a way to fix it. And then there's me. I'm a 6'4 history nerd who aspires to be a history teacher and loves theatre. A pretty unorthodox group right? One thing we all share in common is our love for travel.

<h2><strong>Our Story<br/></strong></h2>
<p><a href=""http://livingmedia.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><strong>Living Media International</strong></a> is an organization that provides educational opportunities through art, music, and creativity to young adults and children in rural Haiti. Sometimes, however, in the process of encouraging our young adults to be strong, innovative, leaders for their community, we are presented with unexpected opportunities to support education in our community in other ways. That's what happened in early 2011 when some of the students in our community classes came to us to tell us about a school which had become the victim of poor organizational planning and good intentions gone bad. The then, St. Jude School was established by another organization shortly after the 2010 earthquake for the many children in the community that were unable to go to other schools due to finances. That other organization, however, abandoned the school only a few months after starting, leaving the school of more than 150 children and a staff of 12 without support or direction. At that time, Living Media decided to help the school complete the year and have since fully adopted the school and renamed it <strong>New Life Primary</strong>.</p>

<h3>The Project</h3>
<p>Now we are undertaking the commitment to build them <strong>a brand new school</strong> building. The place where they are now is a small, damaged building which makes teaching and learning difficult. It is also a borrowed location and for the future of this school to adequately sustain the hopes of the children, we must build our own building that's made for each student to find success. The children need a place where thier imaginations can grow, and they are excited to come to school every morning. The teachers need a place where they have all of the space and materials to sufficiently instruct their students with a necessary level of structure and professionalism. Our community needs a place where they can feel proud to send their children even if they don't all have the financial means to send them to the other schools in the area.</p>
<p>By supporting our campaign you will be making a difference in the lives of these children and countless children in the future by giving them a place to belong and a place where they can believe in their own talents and dreams. Thank you for choosing to walk alongside the teachers and children at New Life Primary!</p>
<p><strong>The entire project</strong> is estimated to cost $84,000 but we have been working on it since last summer.  We have started construction and only need about $20,000 more to finish all of the classrooms so that they can begin school by this coming fall.  If we surpass our goal, however, that's great because we will still need to buy supplies for teachers, cover their salaries for the coming year, buy textbooks for the children, and provide them with hot lunches. </p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>     I've been going on mission trips to Costa Rica for about 5 years.  Last year I went on my first mission trip to Colombia, South America, and I absolutely loved it.  I fell in love with the country and its people.  God has called me back, so I am returning this summer for two different missions. </p>
<p>     For the first mission, I am going with a group to an island near Cartegena.  While there, we will teach the kids English.  They will also be involved in Vacation Bible School type activities while we are there spending time with them at the church.</p>
<p>     For the second mission, I will meet another group of people from my area (Augusta/North Augusta) to travel to the Barranquilla and Bogota areas.  While there, we will do ministry in churches for adults,  children's ministry, youth ministry, and outreach on the streets of Bogota to homeless kids.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get  </h3>
<p>     I will need at least $1,800 for these two missions.  I will go down to teach ESL (English as a second language) and continue in Colombia for the second mission.  The money you donate will go towards my airfare, lodging, food, and transporation.  Your contribution, whether it is prayer or financial assistance, is a blessing to me and an investment in His kingdom.  May God bless you for the seed you sow, and may it be multiplied back to you!</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
     As with the other mission trips I have been on to Costa Rica and Colombia, our presence there before has made a huge impact on the people we have come in contact with.  Our goal is to be an instrument of His love to those we encounter during these mission endeavors, and I believe that God has used us as such.  We have built lasting relationships with those we have spent time with and ministered to on these trips and been used by God to impact the kingdom of God in a positive way by spreading the Good News.  We have seen God deliver and heal on these trips and also been inspired by the hearts of our fellow beleivers in other countries.  This time, I will also be able to teach English to children on an island near Cartegena, which will help them to be better equipped to make money in the future, thereby improving their quality of life. </div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
     If you can't give financially, your prayers would be greatly appreciated!  Also, passing the word along to others is highly encouraged and appreciated as well. Thanks!!!</div></div>","Short Summary

My name is Dace and in this body I have lived 21 years. I grow up in a small country called Latvia besides the Baltic sea. Being the youngest child from five children made my childhood very connected to human relationships and trying to find my place in a very big spectrum of people. And because I was surrounded by people all the time I created the strong love for human beings and any human creature as well as the passion towards making people around me feel full of joy. For the past years I have been closely working with volunteer work, non-formal education and youth organizations to bring opportunities for young people to develop themselves and find their vocation, experience how by working together the joy of life arises.                                                            I am currently participating in social leadership training in Sweden called the Youth Initiative Program (YIP). This program consists of weekly courses on subjects that brings awareness of the world we are living in and how I as an individual can participate in it towards a better tomorrow. And the afternoon activities gives us possibility to put our initiatives to life. Living in close and strongly bonded community have brought a whole new look at the way to treat each other and cooperate towards positive change. One of the most important parts during this year is our internship that takes place in January and start of February, 2014 for 5-6 weeks.

</h3><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p></p>
<p>Hello! We are the team behind Ruby Cup, a social
business working in Berlin and Nairobi. Ruby Cup is improving menstrual hygiene
for girls and women worldwide. </p><p>Did you know that millions of girls living in
poverty miss school because of their periods? Because they can’t afford pads
and are afraid of staining their clothes, many girls end up staying home from
school (UNDP, 2008). This amounts to missing 1 week
per month or 20% of schooling and as a result, many girls drop out entirely. We want to change that.<br/></p>
<p>Ruby Cup is a menstrual cup that lasts for 10
years. It is a hygienic, healthy and long-term solution for your period.</p><p><b>For every Ruby Cup that you buy for yourself through this campaign, we give one to a girl in Kenya. You can also choose only to donate, in case you already have one.</b> <b>For $8 you finance a Ruby Cup and, very importantly, education about reproductive help and menstrual hygiene.</b><br/></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/428450/files/20140312085132-green_Product.png?1394639492"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><b>This campaign</b></p><p>During the campaign, Maxie will be wearing a <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/brainpower"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">#brainpower</a> HAT in public  24/7. It won't come off - not even for one second, <span>until we have reached our goal. <br/> Why? Because in Kenya, a Ruby Cup is #brainpower.  Maxie is wearing it for all the girls in Kenya.</span> Below you can see how she wears the #brainpower hat in public, everywhere and anywhere.<br/></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/449450/files/20140321041432-Screen_Shot_2014-03-21_at_12.13.38_PM.png?1395400472"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><b>How We Work</b><br/><p>In 2011, we moved to Kenya to start working on
the design and production of Ruby Cup in collaboration with our Kenyan team.
One year later, we had designed the right packaging, product and educational
materials to make Ruby Cup attractive to Kenyan girls. They wanted something
cool, modern and pink. And here we are! </p>
<p>We began to sell Ruby Cups through local women in
various slums. But that did not work. Why? Ruby Cups were simply unaffordable
to the girls who needed them most. We had to find a way to cross-subsidize the product.
So we started to sell Ruby Cup over the Internet. Today, every time we sell a
Ruby Cup online, we
donate one to a girl in Kenya. </p>
<p>As part of our work, we educate girls about
menstrual hygiene and reproductive health. Girls often don’t know what’s
happening with their bodies – many don’t know that it’s normal to get a period,
and some even think they’re sick. Menstruation is still a taboo. Help us break
it!</p>
<p>We are
very proud to have equipped 1,500 girls with Ruby Cups and education about
reproductive health and menstrual hygiene in collaboration with our local
partners.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/428453/files/20140312085225-in_school_reproductive_health.png?1394639545"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

</p><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">The program so far has been highly successful and girls' feedback has been overwhelmingly positive.

<i>“Before
I start using ruby cup I was using rags. Sometimes I was using pads I usually
stay home until my menstruation stop because I become shy. But by now I am
using Ruby cup I can do anything I can jump but before I was asking money for
my boyfriends sometimes I was asking my mother sometimes when my mother doesn’t
have money I usually use rages (…) I like ruby cup with all my heart because it
is helping me so much.“ </i>(Letter from Valentine Otiendo, 13 years old, August 2012). </p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/428454/files/20140312085248-Girl_s_letter.png?1394639568"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><b>The Problem</b><br/><p></p><p>
</p><p>We’ve done a lot, but we want to do much more –
and that’s where we need your help! Right now we are receiving numerous requests
from organizations that would like to introduce Ruby Cups to girls in Kenya,
and girls are asking us directly how they can get Ruby Cups themselves. We want
to meet the demand but we have only a few Ruby Cups left and no means to
finance a new round of production, and minimum order quantities mean we have to
order a lot at once. So we need your help.</p><p></p>

Weigaard Kjær and Maxie Matthiessen in 2011. They met in university and are all
menstrual cup users. At some point they learned that menstruation is one of the
main reasons why girls drop out of school. So they founded Ruby Cup because
they believed that no girl or woman should face disadvantages because of her
period. Since then, the Ruby Cup team has won several awards for their social
mission and business model including The Global Social Entrepreneurship
Competition (US) and Venture Cup (Denmark). Ruby Cup is a Sustainia100
Solution, finalist in Ben &amp; Jerry's Join Our Core (EU), recipient of the
Future Impact Award 2nd prize (Switzerland) and has been nominated for the
German Engagement Prize.</span></p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/428461/files/20140312085425-Ruby_Founders.png?1394639665"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/>Ruby Cup founders Veronica D'Souza, Julie Weigaard Kjær and Maxie Matthiessen.<br/><p></p><p></p><p></p><b>What is Ruby Cup?</b><p></p><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Ruby Cup is a healthy, high quality and

for up to 10 years. Its large capacity means that you can go up to 12 hours
without emptying it. This makes it especially good for school girls, since they
can go a whole school day without emptying it. Ruby Cup comes in one size that
fits comfortably before or after childbirth.</span></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/428462/files/20140312085447-Sisterpack.png?1394639687"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p></p><b>What if you like our work but don't have money to give?</b><p></p><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">No money?

Cup: Unterstütze mit uns Mädchen in Kenia!</b></h3><p></p>
<p>Hallo, <br/></p><p>Wir sind das Team hinter Ruby Cup, einem sozialen Unternehmen aus
Berlin und Nairobi. Ruby Cup verbessert die Menstruationshygiene von
Frauen und Mädchen weltweit.</p>
<p>Wusstest
Du, dass Millionen von Mädchen in armen Regionen wegen ihrer Periode
nicht in die Schule gehen? Sie können sich Binden und Tampons
einfach nicht leisten und bleiben zu Hause, um sich nicht mit
Blutflecken auf der Kleidung zu blamieren. Als Folge brechen viele
Mädchen die Schule ganz ab, denn 1 Woche pro Monat der Schule zu
verpassen ist eindeutig zu viel.</p>
<p>Ruby
Cup ist eine Menstruationstasse, die für 10 Jahre hält. Es ist eine
hygienische und langlebige Lösung, mit der Mädchen ihre komplette
Ausbildung von der Grundschule zur Universität abschließen können ohne
sich über ihre Periode Gedanken machen zu müssen.</p><p><b>Wie
wir arbeiten</b></p>
<p>Im
Jahr 2011 sind wir nach Kenia gezogen, um gemeinsam mit unserem
kenianischen Team das Design zu gestalten und die Produktion von Ruby
Cup zu beginnen. Ein Jahr später hatten wir das perfekte Produkt,
inklusive Verpackung und Bildungsmaterial, sodass Ruby Cup für
Kenianerinnen ansprechend ist. Sie wollten etwas Cooles, Modernes und Pinkes. Und hier sind wir angelangt.</p>
<p>Wir
begannen Ruby Cup durch lokale Frauen in verschiedenen Slums zu
verkaufen. Das hat jedoch nicht geklappt. Warum? Ruby Cup war einfach
nicht erschwinglich für die Mädchen, die es am Dringendsten
brauchen. Wir mussten Wege finden, mit denen wir den Preis
querfinanzieren konnten. Also begannen wir Ruby Cup über das
Internet zu verkaufen – nach dem Prinzip „Buy One, Give One“.
Heute wird immer wenn wir einen Ruby Cup verkaufen, einer an ein
Mädchen in Kenia gespendet.</p>
<p>Als
Teil unserer Arbeit bilden wir Mädchen zu Menstruationshygiene und
reproduktiver Gesundheit. Sie wissen häufig nicht, was mit ihren
Körpern passiert, dass die Periode völlig normal ist und manche
glauben sogar krank zu sein. Menstruation ist immer noch ein
starkes Tabu. Hilf uns, es zu brechen!</p>
<p>Wir
sind stolz, schon 1500 Mädchen mit Ruby Cup geholfen zu haben und
sie in Zusammenarbeit mit lokalen Partnern über ihre Körper und
Menstruation aufgeklärt zu haben.</p><p><b>Feedback</b></p>
<p>Bisher
war unsere Arbeit ein großer Erfolg und das Feedback der Mädchen
überragend positiv. Manche schrieben uns <a href=""http://www.ruby-cup.com/de/briefe-von-schulmaedchen"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Briefe</a>, um uns zu sagen,
wie sehr Ruby Cup ihr Leben verbessert hat. 
</p>
<p>„<i>Bevor
ich Ruby Cup benutzt habe, habe ich Stofflappen benutzt oder manchmal
auch Binden. (…) Vorher musste ich meine Freunde oder meine Mama
fragen, ob sie Geld (für Binden) haben. Wenn meine Mama kein Geld
hatte, habe ich meist Lumpen genommen und bin zuhause geblieben, weil
ich mich schämte zur Schule zu gehen. (...) Ich liebe Ruby Cup von
ganzem Herzen, weil er mir so sehr hilft. Ich bin ja nicht einmal
mehr zur Schule gegangen, weil ich fürchtete, dass meine Freunde
merken, dass ich meine Periode habe und mich geniert habe.“ (aus
einem Brief von Valentina Otiendo, 13 Jahre alt, August 2012)</i></p><b>Das
Problem</b>
<p>Wir
wollen noch viel mehr machen und brauchen deshalb Deine Hilfe! Im
Moment stehen wir vor dem Dilemma, dass wir zahllose Anfragen
von Organisationen bekommen, die gerne Ruby Cups an Mädchen in Kenia
bringen würden. Oder Mädchen fragen uns direkt, wo sie Ruby Cup
herkriegen können. Wir haben jedoch nicht die Mittel um eine neue

müssen aufgrund der
Mindestbestellmenge immer viele auf einmal bestellen. Deshalb brauchen wir Eure Hilfe.

Hello! We are the team behind Ruby Cup, a social
business working in Berlin and Nairobi. Ruby Cup is improving menstrual hygiene
for girls and women worldwide. Did you know that millions of girls living in
poverty miss school because of their periods? Because they can’t afford pads
and are afraid of staining their clothes, many girls end up staying home from
school (UNDP, 2008). This amounts to missing 1 week
per month or 20% of schooling and as a result, many girls drop out entirely. We want to change that.
Ruby Cup is a menstrual cup that lasts for 10
years. It is a hygienic, healthy and long-term solution for your period.For every Ruby Cup that you buy for yourself through this campaign, we give one to a girl in Kenya. You can also choose only to donate, in case you already have one. For $8 you finance a Ruby Cup and, very importantly, education about reproductive help and menstrual hygiene.This campaignDuring the campaign, Maxie will be wearing a #brainpower HAT in public  24/7. It won't come off - not even for one second, until we have reached our goal.  Why? Because in Kenya, a Ruby Cup is #brainpower.  Maxie is wearing it for all the girls in Kenya. Below you can see how she wears the #brainpower hat in public, everywhere and anywhere.How We WorkIn 2011, we moved to Kenya to start working on
the design and production of Ruby Cup in collaboration with our Kenyan team.
One year later, we had designed the right packaging, product and educational
materials to make Ruby Cup attractive to Kenyan girls. They wanted something
cool, modern and pink. And here we are! 
We began to sell Ruby Cups through local women in
various slums. But that did not work. Why? Ruby Cups were simply unaffordable
to the girls who needed them most. We had to find a way to cross-subsidize the product.
So we started to sell Ruby Cup over the Internet. Today, every time we sell a
Ruby Cup online, we
donate one to a girl in Kenya. 
As part of our work, we educate girls about
menstrual hygiene and reproductive health. Girls often don’t know what’s
happening with their bodies – many don’t know that it’s normal to get a period,
and some even think they’re sick. Menstruation is still a taboo. Help us break
it!
We are
very proud to have equipped 1,500 girls with Ruby Cups and education about
reproductive health and menstrual hygiene in collaboration with our local
partners.
Our team in Kenya educating girls about female
anatomy.Feedback
The program so far has been highly successful and girls' feedback has been overwhelmingly positive. Some wrote us letters about how much Ruby Cup has helped to improve their lives.
“Before
I start using ruby cup I was using rags. Sometimes I was using pads I usually
stay home until my menstruation stop because I become shy. But by now I am
using Ruby cup I can do anything I can jump but before I was asking money for
my boyfriends sometimes I was asking my mother sometimes when my mother doesn’t
have money I usually use rages (…) I like ruby cup with all my heart because it
is helping me so much.“ (Letter from Valentine Otiendo, 13 years old, August 2012). The Problem
We’ve done a lot, but we want to do much more –
and that’s where we need your help! Right now we are receiving numerous requests
from organizations that would like to introduce Ruby Cups to girls in Kenya,
and girls are asking us directly how they can get Ruby Cups themselves. We want
to meet the demand but we have only a few Ruby Cups left and no means to
finance a new round of production, and minimum order quantities mean we have to
order a lot at once. So we need your help.
What We Need 
We need $40,000 to finance a new batch of
Ruby Cups and make a positive impact for 5,000 girls in Kenya.

We need $40,000 in order to finance a new batch of Ruby Cups. This will equip 5,000 girls with a long-lasting solution for managing their menstruation and allow them to attend school worry-free.You get a chance to make a life-changing impact for a girl in Kenya.What You GetYou get fantastic rewards in exchange for your support. They range
signed marathon jerseys by Kenyna marathon runner Vincent Ochieng to Ruby Cups, a personal video message from a Kenyan girl to fair trade organic t-shirts
with our Ruby message, “Consume less, Live more.” We also offer Ruby Cup t-shirts
with our logo. Our most exclusive reward entails a field trip to Kenya to meet
the team and be part of our work in the field. See your rewards below!Our newest perk: Actress Ursula Karven has signed and donated her newly released book ""Loslassen"" (let go) in support of our campaign. See cover and signature below.Vincent Ochieng, marathon runner form Kenya was so kind to donate his running jerseys.Of course you can buy a Ruby Cup for yourself and one for a girl in Kenya. We also offer t-shirts and bags made from organic fair trade cotton.Above: Examples of your perks: Ruby Cups, Ruby Cup with sterilizers, and our ""Consume less, live more."" fairtrade fashion organic cotton t-shirt and bag. And below our team wearing the exclusive Ruby T-shirt. You can get that, too.Our TeamThis is our team in Nairobi responsible for the education of girls and distribution of Ruby Cups: Maximilla, Amaia, Vanessa, Veronica, Shamim, Julie, and Rachael. Maxie, Eva, and Anka make up our team in Berlin. You
can read more about our roles and who we are here.Your Impact

For $8 you can give one Ruby Cup to a girl and Kenya. This includes not only the product itself but also educations about usage and menstrual hygiene and reproductive health in general.

You will help 5,000 girls receive a long-lasting solution to dealing with their periods. You’ll be helping them attend school without worries and you'll empower them and make their lives so much easier.  
You will help girls learn about reproductive health and help us to break the taboo surrounding menstruation. Girls will learn why they get their periods and that it is absolutely nothing to be ashamed of. 
You will save our environment 60,000,000 tampons’ worth of waste, which would otherwise be created without the use of the Ruby Cup. 
Our partnersAdditional InformationWho is behind Ruby Cup?Ruby Cup was founded by Veronica D'Souza, Julie
Weigaard Kjær and Maxie Matthiessen in 2011. They met in university and are all
menstrual cup users. At some point they learned that menstruation is one of the
main reasons why girls drop out of school. So they founded Ruby Cup because
they believed that no girl or woman should face disadvantages because of her
period. Since then, the Ruby Cup team has won several awards for their social
mission and business model including The Global Social Entrepreneurship
Competition (US) and Venture Cup (Denmark). Ruby Cup is a Sustainia100
Solution, finalist in Ben & Jerry's Join Our Core (EU), recipient of the
Future Impact Award 2nd prize (Switzerland) and has been nominated for the
German Engagement Prize.Ruby Cup founders Veronica D'Souza, Julie Weigaard Kjær and Maxie Matthiessen.What is Ruby Cup?Ruby Cup is a healthy, high quality and
eco-friendly menstrual cup made out of 100% medical grade silicone, reusable
for up to 10 years. Its large capacity means that you can go up to 12 hours
without emptying it. This makes it especially good for school girls, since they
can go a whole school day without emptying it. Ruby Cup comes in one size that
fits comfortably before or after childbirth.What if you like our work but don't have money to give?No money? No problem. There are other ways you
can help. Please spread the word and share this with you friends via email,
Facebook, and Twitter. We understand that not everyone has the financial means
to contribute. By spreading this in your network, you can do a little to make a
big impact.Acknowledgements This campaign would not have been

<h2>Basketballs for St. Kitts!</h2>
<h3>Who we are</h3>
<p><strong>BJ Mumford</strong></p>
<p>I am an aspiring basketball coach, currently living in St. Kitts while my wife attends veterinary school. We have been living here for 2 years, and have about 10 months left until graduation. I have been spending 4-6 hours every day at different basketball courts around the island, coaching players from ages 6 -40 years old at levels ranging from beginner to Senior National Team. I am leading the national team development and youth basketball development programs, and working on training and developing potential athletes to play collegiate basketball.In my spare time, I am pursuing a Bachelor of Sport Science major in Coaching from the United States Sports Academy, planning to graduate in 2016.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Brian Spugnardi</strong></p>
<p>While our wives are chasing their dreams, BJ and I are taking the oppportunity to chase ours.  I have always taken an interest in photography.  Last summer I started intently studying composition, lighting, and anything photography, spending many evenings driving down every road I had never been down to see what I could capture.  Now that I am in St. Kitts, I have a great amount of time to devote to one thing I have always searched for: my passion, photography.  This campaign is my first attempt at a fully produced video and is creating new opportunities and new ideas.  My goal is to be an established landscape photographer.  </p>
<p><a href=""http://www.facebook.com/BrianSpugnardiPhotography"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.facebook.com/BrianSpugnardiPhotography</a></p>
<p> </p>
<h3>What we want to do</h3>
<p>We want to get 20 new basketballs shipped to St. Kitts by the end of the summer to use in upcoming summer camps, as well as youth development leagues that will begin in the fall. With shipping and import costs, one new basketball will cost about $25US. 20 balls X $25=$500.  Unlike the public equipment basketballs, these will be donated as a personal basketball to each player that completes a summer training program, allowing them to continue to improve their skills long after we have left the island. The amount of basketball courts on the island is amazing, but there are very few basketballs, and combined with a lack of youth development organization, most players don't start learning any basketball until age 16.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Why we want to do it</h3>
<p>Most young players in St. Kitts have very few toys, and even less sports equipment, it is very common for a majority of kids to play basketball either barefoot or in flip-flops. With minimum wage at $3US per hour, and new basketball costs at over $40US, most families cannot afford to buy a ball for their child. We want to raise awareness to the international community, as well as the local sports community, of the potential athletes that are waiting to learn the skills required to pursue their dreams of playing basketball. By putting a ball in their hands and giving them the mindset that they can accomplish anything, we hope to empower a generation of kids to pursue self improvement, personal responsibility, and care for personal property.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>What you get in return</h3>
<p>Besides a warm fuzzy feeling inside, we will be sending you a link to a video of the basketballs in use, as well as a picture of the child that received the ball you donated!</p>
<p>Even if you can't afford a donation, sharing this project and video will greatly help our cause! Spread the word!</p>

Who we are
BJ Mumford
I am an aspiring basketball coach, currently living in St. Kitts while my wife attends veterinary school. We have been living here for 2 years, and have about 10 months left until graduation. I have been spending 4-6 hours every day at different basketball courts around the island, coaching players from ages 6 -40 years old at levels ranging from beginner to Senior National Team. I am leading the national team development and youth basketball development programs, and working on training and developing potential athletes to play collegiate basketball.In my spare time, I am pursuing a Bachelor of Sport Science major in Coaching from the United States Sports Academy, planning to graduate in 2016.
 
Brian Spugnardi
While our wives are chasing their dreams, BJ and I are taking the oppportunity to chase ours.  I have always taken an interest in photography.  Last summer I started intently studying composition, lighting, and anything photography, spending many evenings driving down every road I had never been down to see what I could capture.  Now that I am in St. Kitts, I have a great amount of time to devote to one thing I have always searched for: my passion, photography.  This campaign is my first attempt at a fully produced video and is creating new opportunities and new ideas.  My goal is to be an established landscape photographer.

<p>The best way to experience and learn about the innovation economy isn't in a stuffy ballroom - it is up close and personal and in its native habitat. Experienced marketers and conference organizers <strong>Brian Monahan</strong> and <strong>John Battelle</strong> would like your support for a new type of business conference called OpenCo, which we like to think of as a mix between a business conference and artist's open studio with the vibe of a music festival. With your help, more than 100 of the most innovative businesses in NY will open their doors to the public on May 23rd.</p>
<div>
<p>This festival of innovation will celebrate companies that embrace a set of values surrounding the concept of openness: open collaboration, open communication, open community, open company and open doors to you. Attendees will meet these innovators in their native habitat and hear from the founders and executives about how they are trying to change the world and why. They will inspire you and help you make new connections, whether you are a job seeker, investor or simply a curious neighbor.</p>
<p>We already have a growing list of host companies (""HostCos""), who have signed on to open up their doors and share their vision including: <strong>AOL, AppNexus, Betaworks,  Business Insider, Buzzfeed, Estee Lauder Online, Etsy, Fab.com, Foursquare, General Assembly, Kickstarter, Lerer Ventures, Local Response, Pave, PolicyMic, Rap Genius, Rebelmouse, Thrillist, Warby Parker, ZocDoc and many more coming soon!</strong></p>
<p>We ran a ""beta test"" of OpenCo in San Francisco last Fall and the one day event was a huge success. We had over 80 participating companies and 2,000 registered festival goers. Here is a video that gives you a taste of that event: </p>

<p>  My name is Mariah Brown and I am 12 years old. Two years ago, (2011) my family and I took a trip to Ghana, Africa. It was the first time I had gone to Africa.

<p>For the past five years, I have had the privilege of sharing the becoming dad journeys of hundreds of men in my community. I have witnessed firsthand the difference it has made for dads having opportunities to receive father-focused and male-friendly engagement, education and support during pregnancy, as they prepare to be present for the birth of their child, as they prepare for the role of fatherhood, and as the navigate the most transformational passage in their lives - as men, partners and fathers.</p>

<p>I passionately want more men to know the true gifts of fatherhood and how fully embracing their becoming dad journey can enrich their lives in ways they had never imagined.</p>
<p>I passionately want more children to have conscious and connected dads who will love, nurture, protect and guide them with purpose and presence.</p>
<p>I passionately want more families to stay together as they make the challenging transition from being a couple to becoming a family.</p>

</p>
<p>Hi, it's Darby! Most of you know me,
but maybe you don't know that I recently spent 3 amazing months in Uganda. 
I went there without an agenda and without an organization; I wanted to
experience the culture and determine if my skills and passions could be of use
there.</p>
<h2><b>The
Problem</b></h2>
<p>If you saw the video, you heard the
story of Eddy's reunification.  I met him while volunteering with kids who
live on the street, and I helped get him back to his family.  Getting Eddy
home was so simple, and yet<b> there are still thousands of children like him
on the streets and in orphanages for <i>no good reason</i>.</b></p>
<p>Enter Mark and Keren Riley, who are
among the first to stand up for this violation of children's rights. They have
started to reunite Uganda. <a href=""http://www.reuniteuganda.blogspot.co"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span>reuniteuganda.blogspot.com</span></a></p>
<p>Keren began resettling children with
their families a few years ago. As I started tagging along in her work, <b>I
realized what a need there is for more of us to join this effort to get
children out of institutions. </b> ""But don't orphans need
orphanages?"" many people ask.  Actually, no.  Did you know that
around 80% of the children in Ugandan orphanages are <i>not actually orphans</i>?
Check out these stats on children's institutions in Uganda: <a href=""http://www.alternative-care-uganda.org/problem.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span>http://www.alternative-care-uganda.org/problem.html </span></a></p>
<p>In the mid-1990s there were approx
35 orphanages in Uganda, and now there are over 600!  [Only 40 of these
homes are actually licensed by the government.]  These
""orphanages"" receive 95% of their funding from the West...money that
could, in turn, be spent on keeping families together instead of splitting them
apart.</p>
<h2><b>What
we've accomplished so far</b></h2>
<p>I was so excited when Keren invited
me to start an American branch of Reunite Uganda.  I couldn't believe how
perfectly the opportunity dovetailed with my background in education,
non-profits, and working with disadvantaged children and families. Because the
majority of orphanage funding comes from the West, the need to raise awareness
here in the US is great.  <b>Children belong in families, not orphanages.</b></p>
<p>In setting up the American chapter
of Reunite Uganda, it’s taking a full-time employee (me) to set up the 501c3
(just waiting to hear back from the IRS!), create awareness, approach funders,
speak with the media, etc.  We have a strong board of directors here in the
US, and we have people on the ground in Uganda. <b>We continue to need funding.</b></p>
<p>We already ran one successful
fundraiser—the money raised went towards lawyer fees, state and federal
registration fees, a Postal Annex box, office supplies like a printer, ink,
binders and files, and some salary for me to keep going. We are now registered as a
non-profit with the State of Texas, and have filed for our 501c3 status with
the IRS.  We held our first cellphone board meeting (we live in 4
different states!) a few weeks ago.  I just purchased our domain name and
now need to work on an actual website host and setup.  I'll be attending theideacamp.com
next month and hope to get the word out about Reunite while I'm there. 
We're about to finalize a mission statement, and we just opened a small business bank account...an intern
or two would be nice :)</p>
<h2><b>Current
Funding Needs</b></h2>
<p>This second fundraiser will be
split: 50% of the money will cover more of our startup costs here in the US
(i.e. website purchasing and designing, making pamphlets, hosting events, etc),
and the other 50% will go directly to the work in Uganda (money to hire
investigators, economic empowerment officers, and social workers; money to help
families start small businesses so that they can consistently provide for their
children). <b>I ask for your support because this is something I fully believe
in and something I continue to support and fund myself. </b></p>
<p>You can be a part of the beginning
stages of work that no one else is doing. <b>By donating, you will share in
stories like Eddy's.</b></p>
<p>Thank you so much!</p>

<p></p></span></span></span></span></span></span></div>","Hi, it's Darby! Most of you know me,
but maybe you don't know that I recently spent 3 amazing months in Uganda. 
I went there without an agenda and without an organization; I wanted to
experience the culture and determine if my skills and passions could be of use
there.
The
Problem
If you saw the video, you heard the
story of Eddy's reunification.  I met him while volunteering with kids who
live on the street, and I helped get him back to his family.  Getting Eddy
home was so simple, and yet there are still thousands of children like him
on the streets and in orphanages for no good reason.
Enter Mark and Keren Riley, who are
among the first to stand up for this violation of children's rights. They have
started to reunite Uganda. reuniteuganda.blogspot.com
Keren began resettling children with
their families a few years ago. As I started tagging along in her work, I
realized what a need there is for more of us to join this effort to get
children out of institutions.  ""But don't orphans need
orphanages?"" many people ask.  Actually, no.  Did you know that
around 80% of the children in Ugandan orphanages are not actually orphans?
Check out these stats on children's institutions in Uganda: http://www.alternative-care-uganda.org/problem.html 
In the mid-1990s there were approx
35 orphanages in Uganda, and now there are over 600!  [Only 40 of these
homes are actually licensed by the government.]  These
""orphanages"" receive 95% of their funding from the West...money that
could, in turn, be spent on keeping families together instead of splitting them
apart.
What
we've accomplished so far
I was so excited when Keren invited
me to start an American branch of Reunite Uganda.  I couldn't believe how
perfectly the opportunity dovetailed with my background in education,
non-profits, and working with disadvantaged children and families. Because the
majority of orphanage funding comes from the West, the need to raise awareness
here in the US is great.  Children belong in families, not orphanages.
In setting up the American chapter
of Reunite Uganda, it’s taking a full-time employee (me) to set up the 501c3
(just waiting to hear back from the IRS!), create awareness, approach funders,
speak with the media, etc.  We have a strong board of directors here in the
US, and we have people on the ground in Uganda. We continue to need funding.
We already ran one successful
fundraiser—the money raised went towards lawyer fees, state and federal
registration fees, a Postal Annex box, office supplies like a printer, ink,
binders and files, and some salary for me to keep going. We are now registered as a
non-profit with the State of Texas, and have filed for our 501c3 status with
the IRS.  We held our first cellphone board meeting (we live in 4
different states!) a few weeks ago.  I just purchased our domain name and
now need to work on an actual website host and setup.  I'll be attending theideacamp.com
next month and hope to get the word out about Reunite while I'm there. 
We're about to finalize a mission statement, and we just opened a small business bank account...an intern
or two would be nice :)
Current
Funding Needs
This second fundraiser will be
split: 50% of the money will cover more of our startup costs here in the US
(i.e. website purchasing and designing, making pamphlets, hosting events, etc),
and the other 50% will go directly to the work in Uganda (money to hire
investigators, economic empowerment officers, and social workers; money to help
families start small businesses so that they can consistently provide for their
children). I ask for your support because this is something I fully believe
in and something I continue to support and fund myself. 
You can be a part of the beginning
stages of work that no one else is doing. By donating, you will share in
stories like Eddy's.
Thank you so much!

<h2>Hello there! :)</h2>
<h3>We are 2 university students from Slovak Republic participating in a global competition called SENStation and our project made it to the TOP 5 in the world!!

<h2>THE PROBLEM</h2>
<p>Annually, around 10,000 Slovak people with higher education degrees go abroad in order to find better opportunities. This is more than a quarter of those who every year obtain a diploma from universities in Slovakia. Also, according to Academic Ranking of World Universities 2012, Slovakia has no presence in the top 500 of world universities. Another issue is the lack of interaction between private sector and academia in Slovakia. The research coming from academia is at an extremely low number compared to other EU countries.</p>
<p>We believe that there is a strong connection between these facts. Slovak talented students often take their ideas to places where they are able to capitalize them. We feel that Slovak education system does not sufficiently provide students with necessary resources for such ideas or projects.</p>
<p>We would like to stop this brain drain from Slovakia and offer the students a place and means through which they would be able to put their ideas and projects to reality. Also to create more interaction between private sector and academia along with motivating the private sector to fund projects from universities. </p>
<h2>THE SOLUTION</h2>
<p>We would like to create a crowdfunding platform for students from universities and high schools in Slovakia and, later on, other Eastern European countries. This platform would provide them with an ultimate place for presenting, funding or developing their interesting projects. We want to give them a chance to use their potential the best they can. </p>
<p>Moreover, this platform would connect schools with people that could be interested in funding projects such as students, alumni, parents and on the other side companies. The platform would also provide a solution for companies how to promote their brand name to the society as being socially responsible corporations by funding the projects.</p>
<p>Also, thanks to this platform students would be able to find financial resources for facilities (tools and items for educational purposes) that are needed for modern education of the 21<sup>st</sup> century. Students and schools could find funds for anything related to education, innovation, creativity and social cause.</p>
<p>By improving the educational facilities in Slovakia and connecting the private sector with academia (hence, more possible research for universities), we believe that it could improve the overall standings as well in the future.</p>
<h2>SOCIAL IMPACT WE WILL CREATE</h2>
<p>We believe that our project would create social impact in the education system and would also create the opportunity for creating jobs. Namely, the social impact would be:</p>
<ul>
<li>Improving educational environment</li>
<li>Connecting private sector with academia</li>
<li>Creating jobs for students and unemployed people</li>
<li>Letting the students to be ‘free’, giving them the opportunity to rely on their own skills and abilities.</li>
<li>A place for communication between public, academia, and private sector</li>
</ul>
<h3>The whole amount of 5000 euros will go towards our website development. The cost is estimated between 6000-8000 euros.</h3>

Then that affects the people around you.” 
—Marley, 12, Camper
The 8th Annual Tools for Peace Summer Teen Camp is an extension of our ongoing in-school program, and offers youth ages 12-16 a transformative weeklong experience rooted in practicing mindfulness, learning meditation, and cultivating compassion in the beautiful mountains of Tehachapi, California. Over the past thirteen years, more than 2,500 youth throughout Northern and Southern California have benefited from all that Tools for Peace has to offer. With your contribution, youth will immerse themselves in a camp community that fosters life-changing experiences through cultivating compassion. Help us raise $25,000 by August 3rd to fulfill over 35 scholarship requests that we have received for this year's camp.
What makes our camp truly special is the Stop, Breathe & Think Workshop, where teens learn and practice mindfulness meditation, work together in dynamic small group discussions, and participate in engaging activities that enable teens to connect with each other in a safe and supportive environment. Afternoons at camp are full of fun activities: art, sports, yoga, music, crafts, horseback riding, swimming, and the creation of a Community Sand Mandala. Evenings at camp are always a highlight for campers—with campfires, movie nights, and karaoke, and teens return home with a positive and memorable experience.
 
“In the short period of time I spent at camp, my parents and my entire family said I came back a totally different person.” 
—James, 16, Alumni/Peer Mentor 
Who We Are
“Honestly, Tools for Peace has changed my life in a way that I couldn’t have done alone...The greatest thing I have learned is to just be compassionate and filled with joy for the life I’ve been given.” 
—Carlos, 15, Camper
Tools for Peace, founded in 2000 in Pasadena, CA, currently serves communities in the San Francisco Bay and the greater Los Angeles areas. We support teens in middle and high school with in-school, afterschool, and summer camp programs that teach practical methods for cultivating compassion, peace and wellbeing through training in mindfulness and meditation. Our Stop, Breathe & Think Workshop, in particular, helps students learn to settle their minds and work with difficult emotions and thoughts in order to relate to peers and adults more productively.
 
What We Need
""In my everyday life, those little tools that I’ve learned here—the meditation, the mindfulness exercises—have helped me so much to get through stressful situations and to calm myself down.""
—James, 16, Alumni/Peer Mentor
Summer Teen Camp provides teens with invaluable support from an incredible 1:3 counselor to camper ratio. While we usually only accept 30 applicants, this year we received over 35 applications with scholarship requests, and we would like to accommodate each and every one! Our deserving students from in-school programs in the Greater Bay and Los Angeles areas need your help, and you have the power to make a real difference by helping us send all of our students to Summer Teen Camp!
By donating, you provide scholarships to youth from low-income, disadvantaged backgrounds, many whose families may not otherwise be able to afford camp for their teen, but wish to attend. 
Please join our “Compassion-in-Action Chain Reaction” Campaign and donate today. You can give our teens a summer experience to remember by making a gift or by sparking a “Compassion-in-Action Chain Reaction” by spreading the word via Facebook and Twitter. Gifts of all levels ensure our youth can benefit from Summer Teen Camp regardless of ability to pay.
 
Impact
Summer Teen Camp scholarships help children from low-income and minority communities to benefit from all that Tools for Peace Summer Teen Camp has to offer, including learning mindfulness and meditation, building lasting friendships and essential mentor relationships, connecting with nature, and having fun.
Vivianne, 18, Taylor, 18, and Ray, 19, three of our most dedicated alumni/peer mentors, are now pursuing successful academic ventures in college and university.  Vivianne graduated with honors from Saint George's School in Rhode Island, and received a full scholarship to study at Barnard College. Taylor graduated from Robert Louis Stevenson School, and received a full scholarship to study at Wellesley College. Ray has used his mindfulness and meditation training to overcome the challenges that he faces living with autism. He completed his first year at California State University East Bay, and is looking forward to a career in the National Guard—but first he will serve as a Junior Counselor at this year's Eighth Annual Summer Teen Camp in August.
""It helps me put my life into perspective... how to live my life in the most thoughtful way possible, and to help others do the same.""
— Ray, 16, Alumni/Peer Mentor
All three of these remarkable individuals attribute much of their success and ability to succeed, in spite of the significant challenges they have had to overcome, to their many years participating in Tools for Peace programs. We are honored to be a part of their lives and to know that we have contributed to their achievements.
Your donation will provide campers like Vivianne, Taylor, Ray, James, Marley, and Carlos a chance to develop the skills that will support them in all aspects of life.
“What does a world with compassion look like? The entire world would be like this camp. People would help each other all the time, people probably wouldn’t be homeless, there would be true happiness all throughout the world...knowing that everyone had that would make me feel safer.""
—Marley, 12, Camper

<p>For the premiere launch of NP I have chosen this year's Burning Man 
Festival held at Black Rock City, NV from August 26th to September 2nd. 
Burning Man's Placement Department has already awarded NP with a prime 
location for our ""theme camp"" at the very center of the city on Rod's 
Road next to Center Camp.</p>
<p>[see our theme camp location highlighted in yellow]</p>
<p>
</p>
<h3>WHAT?</h3>
<p>For exactly one week out of the year, Center Camp is one of the 
busiest cafes and live venues in the world. Over 50,000 people will pass
 through the area surrounding Center Camp and be able to use the 
services that NP plans to provide: a pancake breakfast from 
8:00-11:00am; workshops on meditation, yoga, performance art, aerial 
acrobatics, and talisman building; seminars on positive psychology; and 
sewing tutorials.</p>

<h3>THE IMPACT</h3>
<p>By providing a safe space for creative expression, NP hopes to teach

minds to new heights by taking part in the various activites offered 
such as laughing yoga classes, hand-sewing tutorials, or aerial 
suspension exercises.</p>
<p>NP has already begun to unite a community of compassionate people who

</p><p><b>DITS</b> – <i>doctor in the shoes</i>. The treatment of various health issues can be
invasive – surgical, medicamentous – through the use of drugs, or nonin-vasive. Our aim is to provide an opportunity of a therapy that would in a
noninvasive way positively affect the human body as a whole. Our feet
are full of acupressure points. Using the traditional Chinese medicine
theory for stimulating these acupoints can significantly affect our health
and improve the functioning of certain human organs. The appropriate
way of stimulating these acupressure points can lead to enhancement of
the functioning of our body organs and can act as a treatment for many
health issues. DITS is capable of assisting not only individuals in their personal treatment of their health issues but also medical clinics, retirement
homes and centers for physically disabled people. In the cases where the
traditional Chinese medicine is not available, the DITS is the solution.

<p><b>Who We Are</b></p>
<p>Hi were Adrianne and Rick, Co founders of Kids International
Development Society (KIDS). In March 2000 our only child and dearest daughter
Danielle was killed by a drunk driver, she was 21. Our search to find healing
and meaning in our lives led us to the formation of KIDS and today we are a
registered Canadian Charity. Each year we volunteer for three to four months
mostly in S.E. Asia and primarily Cambodia. Our focus is on education, clean
drinking water and health care. We work with local people and organizations and
oversee the projects ourselves making sure that the funds donated are wisely
spent and directly assist children, families and communities in need. <b>Over the past thirteen years we have
successfully funded and supported: schools, clinics, solar water systems for
schools, classrooms, children’s hospitals, a girl’s home, women’s weaving
cooperative and other family and educational supplies.</b></p>
<p><b>Our Campaign</b></p>
<p><b>Education is a
priority for KIDS</b> and we see first hand how developing minds changes lives.
We are presently working with a rural school where 1500 children attend and
heard of their desire to learn computer skills. Computer skills can assist
young people to attend University as well as give them an opportunity to find
employment and help support their families. 
They have the classroom, the teacher, electricity and hundreds of kids
have the passion all they need is Your Support to buy the computers and create
a computer lab for these dedicated young people. </p>
<p><b>What We Need</b></p>
<p><b>We are hoping to
raise $7,000.00</b> The funds will renovate a classroom and purchase 25
computers where classes will run regularly for high schools students.</p>
<p><b>The Costs</b></p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>25 computers @ 183.00 each  $4575.00</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>Renovations (tile, ceiling, paint, wiring)  $1700.00</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>Printers, electrical work, computer maintenance   
$725.00</p>
<p><b>Total  $7000.00</b></p>
<p><b>The Impact</b></p>
<p>We have witnessed first hand how education has changed
children and youth’s lives. We have known young people, who thanks to educational support,
have finished University and now have good paying jobs and can help support
their families. We have seen children learn and grow and be able to escape the
difficult life of working in a brick factory as a child labourer.  We work with many Cambodian people who have
faced unthinkable tragedy and now dedicate their lives to helping their own
people. These changes are made possible through education and hard work. <b>Who knows where one computer will lead!</b></p>

heard of their desire to learn computer skills. Computer skills can assist
young people to attend University as well as give them an opportunity to find
employment and help support their families. 
They have the classroom, the teacher, electricity and hundreds of kids
have the passion all they need is Your Support to buy the computers and create
a computer lab for these dedicated young people. 
What We Need
We are hoping to
raise $7,000.00 The funds will renovate a classroom and purchase 25
computers where classes will run regularly for high schools students.
The Costs
· 
25 computers @ 183.00 each  $4575.00
· 
Renovations (tile, ceiling, paint, wiring)  $1700.00
· 
Printers, electrical work, computer maintenance   
$725.00
Total  $7000.00
The Impact
We have witnessed first hand how education has changed
children and youth’s lives. We have known young people, who thanks to educational support,
have finished University and now have good paying jobs and can help support
their families. We have seen children learn and grow and be able to escape the
difficult life of working in a brick factory as a child labourer.  We work with many Cambodian people who have
faced unthinkable tragedy and now dedicate their lives to helping their own
people. These changes are made possible through education and hard work. Who knows where one computer will lead!

<h3>Why She's Going</h3>
<p>When I asked Kellie why she wanted to join us, this is what she said:</p>
<ul>
<li>I have only read about and seen on film, the poverty. This will change my life. I will see how some, if not most of the human race lives. I have always felt the need to help and spread messages but I don't want to feel like I am giving a hand out (or trying to endorse a specific religion) but a lift up...together, because I will be enriched too. I enjoy teamwork to reach a common goal. I'd like to do some manual labor, build something, give chickens, use my hands, and obviously, work as a group.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>I want to be a minority, watching, listening to, being with, people of another culture. I want to see and learn more about Mayan heritage. I want to eat the foods, listen to the flow of another language, embrace varied lifestyles, notice the commonalities, and be influenced by folks who know how to live simply.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Doing something like this, going out of the country, with people I want to learn from, know, trust, want to be, work and bond with, I couldn't ask for a better situation.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>I have fallen in love with Montessori methods and tools. It has changed my whole idea of what being a teacher really means. I want to share this with as many children as I can. I want to see how children from other cultures/countries/lands show their joys, curiosities, personalities, wonderment and interests in learning. I appreciate that the materials and tools we use in Montessori are simple and very effective. Something that I think these folks will really appreciate too. I can't wait to see the teachers and students learn together. I know I will learn more myself than what I will teach.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Of course I can't help but to think of the chance I'll have to explore a new land. I am so excited to see the flora and fauna of Guatemala. My gosh, the mountains, volcanoes, animlals and plants!  I love our world and want to see as much of it as I can.</li>

<p> </p>
<p>My name is Adrian Stephens.  I am here to ask for your help on behalf of my son Jason.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Jason is a highly motivated young man totally focused on his goal of a college education. During his time at Spring Valley High School in Las Vegas, Nevada, he chose Advanced Placement classes at every opportunity.  He graduated with a GPA of 3.25, which, with his AP classes, is a weighted average of 4.03.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Jason was active in school activities.  He was part of the Student/Peer mentorship program helping others to achieve their goals.  He was also a member of AVID, Advancement Via Individual Determination, which prepares students for college.  In addition, he participated in the Model UN where he was highly scored in their debating competition.  He was a chair for the Relay for Life, raising funds for cancer research, and was involved with the Las Vegas Police Athletic League, introducing others to the sport of Lacrosse.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Jason is  an accomplished athlete.  He has a real love for lacrosse, which he has played since the 7th grade.  When Jason picked up his first lacrosse stick he was hooked.  He has played for the local Grizzles team since 2009, and his hard work and dedication helped the team win a state championship in 2011.  In 2012 he was named to the All City and All State teams for his position and received an honorable mention in 2013.  His coaches selected him as Senior Captain in 2013 and his fellow players named him MVP.  When not playing for the Grizzlies he was on several all-star traveling teams, participating in tournaments all over the West Coast.  In addition, in 2012 he was invited to try out for the Brine All American team.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Even though involved in all this, Jason understands that he must help to “pay his way”.  In both his Junior and Senior years of High School he was employed at the bowling center in South Point Casino.  During summer break he worked a full five day a week schedule.  Even during the school year he worked a reduced schedule of Friday, Saturday, and Sunday.   Yes, there was a lot of juggling of time to accommodate work, his lacrosse activities, and his school responsibilities, but Jason did what was necessary.</p>
<p>So, now high school is done and it’s time to move on.  Jason applied to and was accepted by a number of colleges and universities around the country.   He decided on Arcadia University in Glenside, Pennsylvania after looking at all his options.  Arcadia has awarded Jason a four-year, 50% scholarship.  He has also been recruited to play for the Scarlet Knights, Arcadia’s new NCAA D3 lacrosse team.  It’s a match made in heaven and he is determined to go.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Arcadia has worked hard to help Jason, and he has worked hard to help himself.  But with all his accomplishments, we are still having difficulties making his college dream a reality.  Even with the generous scholarship money provided by Arcadia and a small amount of federal student aid we are still $10,000.00 short.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Our biggest problem has been that my husband was involved in a devastating accident in 2010 which resulted in a broken back, shattered foot and ankle and a number of other complications.  After multiple surgeries and other medical interventions, he remains unable to work and is on medical disability.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Jason has also been caught in the new changes in student loan requirements, which has made it difficult for students to qualify.  My salary has made him ineligible for higher student loans in his first year.  In addition, because of the formula used, Jason is not eligible for Pell grant.  Without a Pell grant he is disqualified for other sources of funding as well.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>So why am I posting this information?  I love my son, and want to see him succeed in life.  He is not a young man who expects life to be handed to him on a silver platter.  He is willing to work and wants to work hard.  He is worthy of an investment.  He needs it this year, and once he is through his freshman year will be able to take over and raise the funds for the future.  I am asking anyone who can help Jason over this one hump, to please do so.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Jason doesn’t believe that this will work.  He doesn’t believe that people who don’t know him, have never met him, and don’t necessarily understand him might be willing to contribute to help him achieve his goal.  On the other hand, I believe that all of us who are part of this human experience understand that what goes around comes around and what you give you will receive tenfold.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Yes, I am his Mother, and am prejudiced, but I know my son and his capabilities.  If you can, I am asking you to PLEASE help Jason become a disease pathologist.  Jason is a young man that wants to make a difference.  Please help him do so.</p></div>","Hello:
 
My name is Adrian Stephens.  I am here to ask for your help on behalf of my son Jason.
 
Jason is a highly motivated young man totally focused on his goal of a college education. During his time at Spring Valley High School in Las Vegas, Nevada, he chose Advanced Placement classes at every opportunity.  He graduated with a GPA of 3.25, which, with his AP classes, is a weighted average of 4.03.
 
Jason was active in school activities.  He was part of the Student/Peer mentorship program helping others to achieve their goals.  He was also a member of AVID, Advancement Via Individual Determination, which prepares students for college.  In addition, he participated in the Model UN where he was highly scored in their debating competition.  He was a chair for the Relay for Life, raising funds for cancer research, and was involved with the Las Vegas Police Athletic League, introducing others to the sport of Lacrosse.
 
Jason is  an accomplished athlete.  He has a real love for lacrosse, which he has played since the 7th grade.  When Jason picked up his first lacrosse stick he was hooked.  He has played for the local Grizzles team since 2009, and his hard work and dedication helped the team win a state championship in 2011.  In 2012 he was named to the All City and All State teams for his position and received an honorable mention in 2013.  His coaches selected him as Senior Captain in 2013 and his fellow players named him MVP.  When not playing for the Grizzlies he was on several all-star traveling teams, participating in tournaments all over the West Coast.  In addition, in 2012 he was invited to try out for the Brine All American team.
 
Even though involved in all this, Jason understands that he must help to “pay his way”.  In both his Junior and Senior years of High School he was employed at the bowling center in South Point Casino.  During summer break he worked a full five day a week schedule.  Even during the school year he worked a reduced schedule of Friday, Saturday, and Sunday.   Yes, there was a lot of juggling of time to accommodate work, his lacrosse activities, and his school responsibilities, but Jason did what was necessary.
So, now high school is done and it’s time to move on.  Jason applied to and was accepted by a number of colleges and universities around the country.   He decided on Arcadia University in Glenside, Pennsylvania after looking at all his options.  Arcadia has awarded Jason a four-year, 50% scholarship.  He has also been recruited to play for the Scarlet Knights, Arcadia’s new NCAA D3 lacrosse team.  It’s a match made in heaven and he is determined to go.
 
Arcadia has worked hard to help Jason, and he has worked hard to help himself.  But with all his accomplishments, we are still having difficulties making his college dream a reality.  Even with the generous scholarship money provided by Arcadia and a small amount of federal student aid we are still $10,000.00 short.
 
Our biggest problem has been that my husband was involved in a devastating accident in 2010 which resulted in a broken back, shattered foot and ankle and a number of other complications.  After multiple surgeries and other medical interventions, he remains unable to work and is on medical disability.
 
Jason has also been caught in the new changes in student loan requirements, which has made it difficult for students to qualify.  My salary has made him ineligible for higher student loans in his first year.  In addition, because of the formula used, Jason is not eligible for Pell grant.  Without a Pell grant he is disqualified for other sources of funding as well.
 
So why am I posting this information?  I love my son, and want to see him succeed in life.  He is not a young man who expects life to be handed to him on a silver platter.  He is willing to work and wants to work hard.  He is worthy of an investment.  He needs it this year, and once he is through his freshman year will be able to take over and raise the funds for the future.  I am asking anyone who can help Jason over this one hump, to please do so.
 
Jason doesn’t believe that this will work.  He doesn’t believe that people who don’t know him, have never met him, and don’t necessarily understand him might be willing to contribute to help him achieve his goal.  On the other hand, I believe that all of us who are part of this human experience understand that what goes around comes around and what you give you will receive tenfold.
 
Yes, I am his Mother, and am prejudiced, but I know my son and his capabilities.  If you can, I am asking you to PLEASE help Jason become a disease pathologist.  Jason is a young man that wants to make a difference.  Please help him do so.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Emanuel Dickson grew up in Marangu village, outside the town of Arusha, Tanzania. He comes from the people known as Chaga who live around Africa’s tallest mountain. We met Emanuel during a Kilimanjaro trek in January 2014, where he was our assistant guide. In the first few hours of our trip, even before getting out of the car that brought us to the Kilimanjaro gates, we were very impressed by Emanuel. He showed deep knowledge of world politics, African history, and religion. While hiking we spoke with him about synaptic transmission, philosophy of mind, and the biology of the brain -- certainly not topics we envisioned talking about while on the mountain! It was clear that Emanuel was extremely intelligent and well-read. </p>
<p>We learned that Emanuel had finished 7 out of 8 semesters at St. Joseph’s University in Dar Es Salaam, where he’s majoring in computer science and engineering. But he hasn’t been able to finish his final semester, because his aunt, who had been paying for his schooling, recently passed away. (He has lost several close family members to AIDS.) According to university regulations, if he does not finish his final semester this year, he will not obtain his degree. We communicated directly with the head of his department to verify his story and academic standing, and we decided to create this campaign to support his education. We are raising money to pay for Emanuel’s last semester, which would enable him to get a degree in computer science, and open up the door to greater opportunities in his future.</p>

<p><b>What Emanuel needs </b><br/></p><p>For just $2,700 Emanuel will be able to get his degree. Here's the budget breakdown:</p>

</b></p><p><b><b>How we verified Emanuel's story</b></b></p><b>
</b><p>We asked Emanuel to send over a copy of his official transcript as well as a recommendation letter from the head of his department.

</h3><h3>Save our School </h3>
<p>Our program is shutting down. After 14 years of providing education and
skills to Aboriginal youth in Winnipeg, our existing school is
closing. This puts the future of dozens of at-risk Winnipeg youth in
limbo. Our goal is to 
ensure these youth have a program to return to in September. This is why we are launching this campaign. Northern Stars Eduation Program will
be located in Winnipeg, Manitoba and would cater to Aboriginal youth who want
to work, earn their Mature Grade 12 and transition towards a meaningful career.</p>
<p>Aboriginals are the fastest growing demographic in Canada. Manitoba
boasts the youngest population of any 10 Canadian provinces thanks to the
Aboriginal population. Yet 50% of Aboriginal Youth in Winnipeg do not have
their Grade 12 because of a number of barriers.</p>
<p><strong>Northern Stars Education Program</strong> </p>
<p>We've
incorporated the name ""Northern Stars Education Program"" as a
not-for-profit organization that will serve as our foundation for the new
school. We already have teachers and staff from the old school who are ready
and willing to start new - and we have many organizations and First Nations
interested in helping out. But we need to raise seed money to get our program
going. </p>
<p>They know that we have the experience and credibility to keep our program
running. But we need to save our school before September, so our students can
return!</p>
<p>This program is completely non-profit. The Northern Stars Education Program
Inc. board is comprised of seven Aboriginal and Non-Aboriginal members and
three advisors with formidable experience in education, program development,
cultural programming, business management, finance, construction, green technology
and advocacy.</p>
<p>With your help we can make our new school a
reality.</p>
<p><b>Our New School</b></p>
<p>In order to make our new school a reality we need
to raise seed money to get our program going. Your donation will go towards the
bricks and mortar of our new facility including things like tables, chairs, computers
and new tools. </p>
<p><b>Making a Difference</b></p>
<p>For the past fourteen years our program has made a real impact with over
150 graduates in the last six years alone. Our successes also go well beyond
the classroom with our graduates strengthening the fabric of their families and
of their communities. With many of our students traveling to Winnipeg from
their northern communities, our program becomes their home away from home.
Without our program our students may not find the supports they need in order
to succeed.</p>
<p><b>Real Challenges</b></p>
<p>Moving to Winnipeg to go to school is a reality for thousands of
Aboriginal Youth across Canada. Manitoba is home to 63 First Nation communities
yet 42 of them do not have a high school. This means that many Aboriginal Youth
must leave their families behind to go to school during a critical time in
their life. Fitting in, finding the right school, making new friends,
loneliness and racism are some of the barriers Aboriginal Youth have to face in
the big city.</p>
<p>Our school offers the supports our students need so they can deal with
the stresses of life in the big city including counselling, peer supports, cultural

</ul></div>","Save our School 
Our program is shutting down. After 14 years of providing education and
skills to Aboriginal youth in Winnipeg, our existing school is
closing. This puts the future of dozens of at-risk Winnipeg youth in
limbo. Our goal is to 
ensure these youth have a program to return to in September. This is why we are launching this campaign. Northern Stars Eduation Program will
be located in Winnipeg, Manitoba and would cater to Aboriginal youth who want
to work, earn their Mature Grade 12 and transition towards a meaningful career.
Aboriginals are the fastest growing demographic in Canada. Manitoba
boasts the youngest population of any 10 Canadian provinces thanks to the
Aboriginal population. Yet 50% of Aboriginal Youth in Winnipeg do not have
their Grade 12 because of a number of barriers.
Northern Stars Education Program 
We've
incorporated the name ""Northern Stars Education Program"" as a
not-for-profit organization that will serve as our foundation for the new
school. We already have teachers and staff from the old school who are ready
and willing to start new - and we have many organizations and First Nations
interested in helping out. But we need to raise seed money to get our program
going. 
They know that we have the experience and credibility to keep our program
running. But we need to save our school before September, so our students can
return!
This program is completely non-profit. The Northern Stars Education Program
Inc. board is comprised of seven Aboriginal and Non-Aboriginal members and
three advisors with formidable experience in education, program development,
cultural programming, business management, finance, construction, green technology
and advocacy.
With your help we can make our new school a
reality.
Our New School
In order to make our new school a reality we need
to raise seed money to get our program going. Your donation will go towards the
bricks and mortar of our new facility including things like tables, chairs, computers
and new tools. 
Making a Difference
For the past fourteen years our program has made a real impact with over
150 graduates in the last six years alone. Our successes also go well beyond
the classroom with our graduates strengthening the fabric of their families and
of their communities. With many of our students traveling to Winnipeg from
their northern communities, our program becomes their home away from home.
Without our program our students may not find the supports they need in order
to succeed.
Real Challenges
Moving to Winnipeg to go to school is a reality for thousands of
Aboriginal Youth across Canada. Manitoba is home to 63 First Nation communities
yet 42 of them do not have a high school. This means that many Aboriginal Youth
must leave their families behind to go to school during a critical time in
their life. Fitting in, finding the right school, making new friends,
loneliness and racism are some of the barriers Aboriginal Youth have to face in
the big city.
Our school offers the supports our students need so they can deal with
the stresses of life in the big city including counselling, peer supports, cultural
teachings and life skills classes.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>United Vision, o.s. sends well-trained volunteers to Mexico who teach English using highly effective methods. Our programs are aimed at rural areas with potential for tourism. The main objective is to educate LOCAL PEOPLE WHO COULD MAKE USE OF THE KNOWLEDGE OF ENGLISH TO ADVANCE THEIR BUSINESSES or to start off their own business activities connected with ecotourism.</p>
<p>In the next stage of our mission we plan to expand our efforts by starting needed programs to complement the successful local developing support. These include: microfinancing services, fair-trade agreements, e-shop platforms for local products, eco-tourism development, and sponsoring of children's educational programs, all in English.</p>
The pilot project, which lasted from September 2011 to March 2012, HAS PROVED THAT THE CONCEPT BENEFITS MEXICAN PEOPLE in rural areas with a strong desire to access high quality education and improve living conditions for themselves and their families. Since then, more volunteers have been working in Mexico.</div>
<div>
<h3>Current Situation</h3>
</div>
<div>
<p>United Vision will send TWO OTHER VOLUNTEERS to Mexico soon. They will be teaching English in the communities of Michoacán and Veracruz respectively. In each community there are around FIFTY STUDENTS, both children and adults, already expecting them and ready to continue studying. Current capacities of the organization, however, are limited and ensuring the CONTINUOUS SUPPLY OF VOLUNTEERS IN PARTNER COMMUNITIES still remains a main challenge.</p>
<h3>What will be covered</h3>
</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>$450 cover the costs of ACCOMMODATION AND MEALS for one volunteer per month</li>
<li>$500 cover OPERATIONAL AND LEGAL EXPENSES of United Vision for one year (tax and accounting obligations, bank account fees, domain registration, website hosting fees)</li>

<p>We are students, teachers, and volunteers from the Union Settlement Adult Education program.  Over the past four months we have met to find solutions to the challenges the Adult Education program faces, including a growing demand for classes and a need for more effective teaching tools.</p>
<p><strong>Why are we asking?</strong></p>
<p>In 2009 Union Settlement offered 47 courses reaching 1,250 adult learners. Students came from across New York City to take courses in English for Speakers of Other Languages, Adult Basic Education and to study for the GED in English, Spanish and French. Unfortunately the recession resulted in budget cuts that have greatly reduced the number of classes Union Settlement, and Adult Education providers across New York City, can provide. Currently the agency can only offer 17 classes. During the last registration period more then 600 individuals came to sign up for the 300 spaces we have available.</p>
<p>Union Settlement has dedicated every penny of current funding to meeting the rising need for services. Many of our teachers are here as volunteers, and finding funding for even basic supplies like dry erase markers is a struggle. </p>
<p>Many of our students have been forced, or pushed, out of school by unavoidable circumstances. Despite the obstacles that confront them daily our students are determined to pursue their education.  Becoming a student again as an adult is challenging, and we want to mirror their commitment by giving them the opportunity to improve the school for themselves and future students to come.</p>

<p><strong>Education For Children</strong>, (Senegal) registered as an non-profit organization in 2010.  To date we have sponsoring 152 children. We supply these children with the necessary school resources through the generous donations of friends and family. In Senegal many children don’t go to school or leave school early because they can't afford to attend. Many children are seen as more valuable to their parents at home, doing domestic chores and caring for younger siblings.  </p>
<p>We believe that the benefits of sending a child to school, especially girls are very important but this is not always obvious to Senegalese parents. Many children are forced to work by their parents, trading crafts.</p>
<p>As a child in Senegal, there are barriers to learning, especially for those who have no light at night nor a quiet place to study. Children are often too hungry to study and we believe that we need to find a solution to their lack of proper nutrition and give them every opportunity to have a good education so they will become leaders and maybe even teachers in future. We believe that by providing a place for the children to learn to grow their own food, save their own seeds and plant food for the future is vital for our nation to grow independent of foreign aid and begging.</p>
<p>We aim to:</p>
<ul>
<li>set up community gardens based on permaculture principles</li>
<li>teach kids how to create organic fertilizers, compost and worm farms</li>
<li>encourage families to grow and involve them in the education process</li>
<li>teach skills in waste management and sanitation</li>
<li>improve the school environment</li>
<li>encourage children to enjoy nutritious foods</li>
</ul>
<p>There are estimated to be about 150,000 Talibé children in Senegal aged 4 to 18 years, who spend each day begging. Many of them are beaten by their elders and run away from home. The trauma of their childhood leaves them in a state of loss and they often end up on the streets, homeless and commiting crimes and trafficking drugs.</p>
<p><strong>What we need:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Land - $12,000</li>
<li>Building materials (for security) - $3000</li>
<li>Gardening tools - $2000</li>
<li>Books and educational resources - $2500</li>
<li>School supplies - $5000</li>
<li>Bore hole and well - $2500</li>
<li>Permaculture training course assistance - $3000</li>
<li>Animal stock, (12 chickens &amp; 2 sheep) - $600</li>
<li>Aquaponics equipment - $3000</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Total cost needed = $33,600</strong></p>
<p>If it so happens that we don't raise this amount we will focus on supporting the children with what we have and meanwhile we will develop a strategy for income streams such as the sale of produce and arts and craft production and marketing. </p>

YES vote in the Independence referendum in September 2014. We've been 
working as a group for almost 2 years now to bring the positive message of the YES 
campaign to the people of East Ayrshire.In order to fundraise I have abstained from drinking any sugary/caffeinated/alcoholic drinks from the 100 days to go mark until the vote on 18th September. I will be giving up any unhealthy snack foods, chips, cakes or takeaway from 70 days to go and when we reach 40 days to go I will be giving up meat. Saying No to fundraise for a YES vote.This fundraiser is to
 raise money to fund the local YES campaign in the last few months in the 
lead up to the vote on the 18th September. We need campaign materials and lots of them as we go door to door canvassing.This
 is the most important part of the campaign as we actively talk to 
people to outline that Scotland can be, should be and must be an 
Independent country to realise our own potential and make our country a 
better, fairer and more equal society.  What We Need & What You Get We need funds to supply our stall, shop and canvassing sessions with the tools and accessories required to do a professional and important job as part of the Indy ref.Talk to me - Donate £25 and get a 'Talk to me' pack to help spread the visibility of the campaign. Convince me - Donate £50 and get 5 'Talk to me' packs to give to other supporters and multiply the effect of visibility by 5 or give to people who you have convinced about the benefits of YES yourself.Sign me up - Donate £120 and get 10 'Talk to me' packs and help out the YES campaign by helping to convince 10 others, a YES mug and become an honorary member of the team with your own original YES East Ayrshire t-shirt.   The ImpactIt goes without saying that if we are successful in helping convince people to vote YES we are convinced that this will change our country for the better. It must be obvious to everyone that those that have the most to gain from Scotland being a success are the people who live and work here. We should have the power to decide for ourselves how are country is run, it is after all normal and how the vast majority of countries are run.This will be the biggest thing to happen in Scotland in its history and also important on a worldwide perspective as well, it shows others that peaceful democratic change can happen through the ballot box rather than through violent means.

<h3>HELLO!! My name is Patricia (Malkie) Raythe and I am a 2nd semester (1st year) veterinary student, at St. George's University School of Veterinary Medicine. </h3>
<p>Next summer (2015), I will have the opportunity to go on a once-in-a-lifetime adventure; joining only 80 fellow veterinary students from around the world in South Africa to enhance our careers in veterinary medicine.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I will be finishing up my 3rd semester @ St. George's University's College of Veterinary Medicine next spring, Just before my journey to South Africa begins.</p>
<p>SYMCO (The organization that organizes and runs the symposium) offers a rare chance to get hands on experience in one of the most diverse wildlife populations on planet earth. The lessons we will learn in those 18 days will greatly enhance our veterinary skills for our entire lives!!</p>
<p>This is a HUGE opportunity that very few veterinary students get to take advantage of, so attending and getting the most out of the hands on experience and lectures on the trip would really give me helping hand in getting started on my career when I graduate.</p>
<h3>Getting to South Africa</h3>
<p>As you know, flights half way around the globe and back don't come cheap, nor does the symposium itself:</p>
<p>Every single cent that is raised will go towards paying for my plane tickets, travel expenses and the symposium registration fee. I am hoping to gain additional funding from the school, however their grant money is difficult to come by, when you are a college student with student loans, every cent counts!</p>
<p>The student who turned me on to indie go go said that I could bring back a little piece of South Africa as a gift to everyone who helps, I think that would be awesome to do so if you do donate you will get a little piece of South Africa along with my thanks and gratitude! I have set different donation levels with different presents that I could bring back!</p>

<p>Hello, my name is Uwe Kreuzahler and I’m the founder of mibuho.com!<br/>
        I have worked with computers my whole life, studying system informatics back in ’78 at the Technical University in Dūsseldorf and got my degree at the ETH in Zūrich at 1982<br/>
        After graduation i’ve worked for almost a decade for IBM and moved 1996 to Costa Rica, providing network security, web development and graphic design to the community.</p>
<p>Being a father of 3 girls i got confronted over the last years with the lack of knowledge at the schools here in Costa Rica.<br/>
          After doing research i have found that this situation in Costa Rica is no exception in whole Latin America. <br/><br/>
          Teachers still teach very old materials, therefore most computer users in Latin American countries doesn’t have a chance to learn how to use todays software.<br/><br/>
          Unfortunately at this time only a few sites are available providing some basic tutorials in spanish, the majority of the good tutorial sites online are totally in focus of English speaking members, and on top they are very expensive.</p>
<p>The goal is to provide at least 2,500 tutorials within the first year, covering different subjects with software of all kind. Word, Excel, Photoshop, HTML, CSS and many others.</p>
<p>Membership will be provided on a very low rate, so we will be able to afford the basic operational expenses, which are based in the connectivity for the servers, the producers of the tutorials and office staff members who will provide additional support and keep everything running.</p>
<p>To make this project a reality we ask for your help, even one dollar will make a huge difference, just imagine the impact you will have in so many families who never had and never will have the chance to rich the educational tools to improve their lives. </p>

Jaron (14, wearing the Captain America sweatshirt in above pic), Liberty (13), Grace (11), and Hope (9) competed all season, including the recent Minnesota State tournament, where each of their teams qualified for Nationals (and Jaron finished 11th out of over 300 middle school boys)!We need to find a way to Louisville, Kentucky, May 9th & 10th!What We Need & What You GetWe are a homeschooling family of 11 (yes, that means 9 children!) We love it and wouldn't have it any other way. We get by, we always have, and we have faith that we always will.But a trip like this is an unexpected, and therefore unbudgeted, big expense!It's big extras like this, that many (perhaps most) families wouldn't be able to do without the help of a network of loving and supportive friends. 
We need two hotel homes, which we've reserved already (in faith) for 3 nights for just under $800.
We estimate around $500 for gas (we drive a 12-passenger van)
The archers' registration fees are $120
We also need to eat along the way :)

<h3>What We Do</h3>
<p><span>The Vision of City of Dreams is to end the generational poverty cycle in San Francisco's most challenged neighborhoods.  This vision is articulated by our youth and powered by our mission as members of their community: to help them build brighter futures through meaningful mentorship and youth development programming that includes taking them out on experiential learning events every Saturday of the year.  </span></p>
<p>In City of Dreams, we challenge young people to reach their highest potential through Experiential Learning. The events call for youth to solve problems, overcome fears, work as a team, try new things, explore creativity, embrace support, and identify their options. We offer challenge ropes courses, camping, museum visits, poetry slams, golfing, sailing, organic farming, skiing, rock climbing, and a self-esteem building camp. We also include Community Development Days as a way for our kids to learn to give back to the community.</p>
<p>We nurture adolescents’ emotional and social development by providing a curriculum of “12 Life Lessons"" like love, hope, trust, accountability and responsibility. We support each youth by pairing them with an experienced, trained mentor. We prepare young people to become leaders through our Junior Mentor Program. We model teamwork by partnering with key neighborhood groups.</p>
<p>Above all, we inspire young people to face life with courage, joy, and commitment to building a better world.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>We need your help to provide 20 Saturdays experiential learning events to these youth!  Each Saturday costs on average $1000.00 to cover a healthy lunch and light breakfast, transportation, and program/entry fees for 20 youth.  </p>
<ul>
<li>$10.00 covers just the nutritional needs (lucnch and light breakfast) of one youth on our next Saturday experiential learning event.</li>
<li>$20.00 covers the transportation costs of getting a youth from their nieighborhood to a Saturday experiential learning event.</li>
<li>$20.00 covers the entry or program fees for one youth's participation in a Saturday experiential learning event with the best youth experience providers that the Bay Area has to offer. </li>
<li>$50.00 covers an entire Saturday experiential learning event for one youth.</li>
<li>$1000.00 covers an entire Saturday experiential learning event for a group of 20 youth. </li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Supporting the roses growing from concrete and helping them to plant rose gardens in their communities.  </p>
<p>City of Dreams goes beyond conventional youth development programs to give kids a real chance at becoming the best they can be. We know that kids from challenged neighborhoods need an extra leg up to get their lives on track, and we provide the right mix of innovation, support, and research-backed methods to make that happen.</p>
<p><strong>Young people from San Francisco’s public housing communities start out with the odds stacked against them.</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Only 1 in 4 graduates high school.</li>
<li>Many become pregnant. Teen births are twice San Francisco’s average.</li>
<li>The leading cause of premature death is homicide.</li>
<li>Exposure to gangs, drugs and violence is the norm.</li>
</ol>
<p>Steep challenges like these call for big, bold answers, and City of Dreams provides them. We wrap time-tested approaches of experiential learning and mentorship into our unique, two-year curriculum of “12 Life Lessons”. We reinforce kids’ learning with journaling and discussion groups, and we make sure they retain newly gained skills and knowledge by repeating the 12 lessons. We make it fun and challenging, so kids stick with us.</p>
<p><strong>Our goal is to expand kids’ perspectives and build their developmental assets. As a result, youth in City of Dreams make healthy choices and stay away from risky behaviors that keep them from achieving their full potential.</strong></p>
<p>In City of Dreams, young people learn and discover by doing, and along the way they acquire a toolkit for solving problems, identifying dreams, setting goals, and resolving conflicts nonviolently. They leave our program as confident, positive young people who can think for themselves and contribute to their own lives and to their communities with practical skills and inspiration.</p>

<h2>ATTN NYC: LOVE YOUR LIVER</h2>
<p>Hi Everyone! Vicki and Andrew here -- we're New York City natives that want to help spread a message about protecting your liver, the largest internal organ in your body. Over 5 million Americans, including as many as 232,000 fellow New Yorkers, live with chronic hepatitis B or C. These are blood-borne viral infections that mainly target the liver. If left untreated, viral hepatitis can cause severe liver damage, scarring of the liver (cirrhosis), and can even lead to liver cancer.</p>
<p>But viral hepatitis can be treated, and serious liver damage can be prevented if infection is detected early. So we want to do our part to help spread awareness of this disease in NYC and encourage communities to get tested for hepatitis B and C.</p>
<h3>NYC World Hepatitis Day 2012</h3>
<p>This July 28th is World Hepatitis Day, as recognized by the World Health Organization. Along with organizations in countries all around the world, we want to celebrate this event in NYC and use it as an opportunity to bring more attention to this silent epidemic.</p>
<p>We're partnering with community organizations and local liver advocates to hold events all across NYC, in six languages and in all five boroughs, reaching into the communities most affected by hepatitis B and C.</p>
<p><a href=""http://goo.gl/maps/Zr96"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""http://goo.gl/maps/Zr96""><img alt=""http://sphotos.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ash3/557146_253780424737708_1440771869_n.jpg"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://sphotos.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ash3/557146_253780424737708_1440771869_n.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></a></p>
</div>
<div>
<p>And to highlight this global event, the World Hepatitis Alliance is attempting to set a Guinness World Record for the most number of people performing the <a href=""http://www.worldhepatitisalliance.org/WorldHepatitisDay/GuinnessWorldRecord.aspx"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""http://www.worldhepatitisalliance.org/WorldHepatitisDay/GuinnessWorldRecord.aspx"">""see no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil""</a> action in 24 hours at multiple venues around the world. We want one of those venues to include Union Square Park in Manhattan, a place where fellow New Yorkers and liver lovers can make a statement against hepatitis B and C.</p>

ATTN NYC: LOVE YOUR LIVER
Hi Everyone! Vicki and Andrew here -- we're New York City natives that want to help spread a message about protecting your liver, the largest internal organ in your body. Over 5 million Americans, including as many as 232,000 fellow New Yorkers, live with chronic hepatitis B or C. These are blood-borne viral infections that mainly target the liver. If left untreated, viral hepatitis can cause severe liver damage, scarring of the liver (cirrhosis), and can even lead to liver cancer.
But viral hepatitis can be treated, and serious liver damage can be prevented if infection is detected early. So we want to do our part to help spread awareness of this disease in NYC and encourage communities to get tested for hepatitis B and C.
NYC World Hepatitis Day 2012
This July 28th is World Hepatitis Day, as recognized by the World Health Organization. Along with organizations in countries all around the world, we want to celebrate this event in NYC and use it as an opportunity to bring more attention to this silent epidemic.
We're partnering with community organizations and local liver advocates to hold events all across NYC, in six languages and in all five boroughs, reaching into the communities most affected by hepatitis B and C.



And to highlight this global event, the World Hepatitis Alliance is attempting to set a Guinness World Record for the most number of people performing the ""see no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil"" action in 24 hours at multiple venues around the world. We want one of those venues to include Union Square Park in Manhattan, a place where fellow New Yorkers and liver lovers can make a statement against hepatitis B and C.
But We Need FUNDING, & We Need SUPPORT:
Donations will help us fund the supplies and materials needed for this ambitious project.
This includes:

T-Shirts
Posters (in SIX languages!)
Fliers
Transportation
and other outreach materials..

But more importantly, we also need your support!

If you or anyone you know want to help us celebrate NYC World Hepatitis Day and help us reach into your community, please fill out this volunteer form. 
If you represent a community organization that would like to help participate in our events, please email us at NYCWorldHepatitisDay@gmail.com

</div></div>","Our Story
My vision is of a world where each individual is able to listen effectively, articulate clearly, and be open to receiving their needs and the needs of others without judgment, criticism, or blame; but with love, compassion, and kindness.  What a wonderful world it will be when we all can listen to one another, clearly articulate our need, and be open to receiving what we request.  What would happen if our world leaders came together and practiced compassionate communication?  What a different world this would be.  I’m holding the vision of World Peace in My Lifetime.  Let there be Peace on Earth and let it begin with me.  We each must do our part.  Be Peace!  

 


The Impact
My strong desire to support others in understanding the benefits of Compassionate Communication (NVC), is leading me to participate in the Power-With Leader Development Program.  PWLDP is a yearlong program designed for businesses and Non-Profit organizations to help develop a unified connection and support of Compassionate Communication on all levels.   Thank you for your generosity.
Namaste’  Rev. Yvonne McAndrew

What We Need & What You Get
What the world needs now is love sweet love… is a line from an old song, and yet it still rings true.  Are you willing to be an advocate for bringing peace, harmony, and love into the world through Compassionate Communication?  
 
The funds I receive through this campaign will go to support this specialized PWLDP training.  When my training is complete, I will be offering Compassionate Communication Workshops to help further spread the message and engage those who are willing ‘to be the change’.  Each person who engages in Compassionate Communication creates a positive ripple effect upon those they interact with and the ripple expands… 
Changing the world one person (ripple) at a time.   
 
12 month Power-With Leader Development Program $4500 
 
Donors to my campaign will be offered a special Contributors rate to my Compassionate Communication Workshops.

<p class=""p1"">I have already completed and paid for parts 1 and 2 of the training.

<p class=""p1"">In Part 2, I took that new vocabulary and vision and broke apart the box of my own limiting beliefs to get rid of the blockages that have kept me from shining in my life.  It was done together with a group of 37 connected souls who have become like my family through this transformation. </p>
<p class=""p1"">Now my group is about to embarking on the final and most powerful part of the training called Masterful Living (ML10). In ML10 we will use all of the amazing transformative tools and self knowledge combined with the power of team to actually make my dreams a reality.

microloans to entrepreneurs in the developing areas of the world. Students are
able to learn about microfinance while simultaneously helping people help
themselves and their families out of poverty. Founded in Spring 2009, GLOBE is
celebrating five years of success. They have provided 48 loans to 76 borrowers,
some of them group loans, and are operating in on three continents in five
countries that include Kenya, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Nigeria,
Nicaragua and Vietnam. The Daughters of Charity act as GLOBE field partners and
recommend loan candidates, distribute funds, and help collect loan repayments
from the entrepreneurs in their communities. About 87 percent of these
entrepreneurs are women whose profits allow them to support their families and
educate their children. GLOBE runs strictly on donations and at least 95 cents
of every dollar donated goes directly to helping one of their borrowers or
supporting student field work. The program is hoping to expand its presence in
the developing world and currently has 16 new loan applications awaiting
approval. The participating students have been working diligently, and at the
end of the semester, GLOBE will have graduated a total of 237 students, each of
whom leaves the program more knowledgeable about the world of microfinance and

<p>The cement school was built in 1994. It has no toilets, no water well, and 30% of children are getting sick throughout the year because of the hygiene crisis. </p>
<p>Currently, there are 197 children and 8 teachers who wash their hands at a very dirty lake (sewage runoff) 200 meters from their school. They urinate and defecate nearby. This is the worst school sickness rate Jhai has seen in the 18 schools we've visited. Paksong Primary School has never had any hygiene education before Jhai's WASH program this year.</p>

Jhai Tribe, we have reached our first goal of $3,000! THANK YOU!


Our new 'Stretch Goal' is $4,750!

If we reach our stretch goal, Jhai can build the 6th clean water well that would be installed at Paksong Primary School! 


The cement school was built in 1994. It has no toilets, no water well, and 30% of children are getting sick throughout the year because of the hygiene crisis. 
Currently, there are 197 children and 8 teachers who wash their hands at a very dirty lake (sewage runoff) 200 meters from their school.

Paksong Primary School has never had any hygiene education before Jhai's WASH program this year.



Also, since we hit our goal, we have added a new $50 donation perk to get your NAME ENGRAVED + PICS!

Help Jhai Build a Clean Water Well in Phou Dam Kwon Village!

These 202 children, who attend primary and secondary school in Phou Dam Kwon village, do not have access to clean water to wash their hands or collect drinking water.






The Problem


During the Vietnam War, the U.S. dropped an average of one planeload of bombs on Laos every eight minutes, 24 hours a day, for nine straight years, totaling $47 billion. Due to the focus on rebuilding city infrastructure before rural areas, Laos has both a hygiene and water crisis, resulting in diarrhea being the #2 killer of Lao children under the age of five.



The Solution




Jhai Coffee House is the world’s first completely philanthropic coffee roaster and café located at the source. Jhai educates farmers on specialty growing practices, purchases coffee direct, above Fair Trade prices, and invests 100% of net profits into water and hygiene solutions at schoolhouses within the community.In 2013-14, partnerships with the Lao Government, JCFC and private water filter company, Terra Clear, enabled Jhai to serve 18 schools, totaling 2,678 children. These schools now have water purification filters and have completed Jhai’s hygiene (WASH) program. Jhai also installed four Unicef-manufactured clean water pumps at schools that previously had no access.

<p>My name is Caty Brownstone-Stillwell and I'm a second grade teacher at Belding Elementary School in Chicago, Illinois. I have taught in Chicago Public Schools for ten years.</p>

But first they need to get there. Your donations will help change the lives of these children.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

</p><p><b><big>About Us</big></b></p>
<p><b>The Green Mountain Druid Order </b>(the
GMDO) is a contemporary Mystery School and community in the Green Mountains of
Vermont. Rooted in ancient wisdom, our Order was created in these times of
great change with the intent of training a growing number of empowered stewards
of the Earth. We align ourselves with the spirit of Gaia in order to heal,
teach, and make a real difference in the world. </p>
<p>The GMDO was created in 2006 by Ivan McBeth and Fearn Lickfield, who
administer the Green Mountain School of Druidry which offers regular trainings
at Dreamland in Worcester, Vermont, USA and around the world by correspondence.
</p>
<p>Our community is active and ever expanding. We gather regularly for Grove
meetings, an annual Eisteddfod, public seasonal ceremonies, a 5-day Druid Camp,
ecstatic dances and related workshops by other amazing teachers in the magical
field. We are also excited to be hosting workshops in Permaculture as a
practical extension of our commitment to serving the health of the land.  </p>
<p>Dreamland, the home of the Green Mountain School of Druidry, is a blossoming
spiritual center, an Earth Mysteries School, a working homestead practicing
sustainable living and land healing and a destination for those searching for
community and deep spiritual connection with the Earth.</p>
<p><b><big>About Our Project</big></b></p>
<p><b>We need $21,000 to build our Geodesic
Dome! </b>Why a dome?</p>
<p>This dome will be our new classroom and meeting space. Currently, all our
classes are held outside in the Dragon Temple (our stone circle), in our canvas
teepee, or in our lovely one room hobbit house when the temperature or weather
prevent us from being outside. The extra space that the dome will provide will
ensure that we can host our classes, healing sessions, guests, and events.
Having the dome will benefit our teaching and healing abilities and therefore
the experiences of our students who are seeking to transform and heal
themselves so they can be effective practitioners, teachers, and healers of the
Earth.</p>
<p><big>More about Geodesic Domes</big></p>
<p>Geodesic domes are structures that look like half spheres made up of many
triangle supports. They are extremely efficient and inexpensive. Buckminster
""Bucky""Fuller, an American engineer who helped spread and
commercialize polyhedral ""geodesic"" constructions throughout the
country, took his dome design inspiration from nature. He marveled at the
structural uniformity of things like snowflakes, seed pods, flowers and
crystals and resolved that humans should emulate those simple, strong, and
noticeably spherical arrangements.<br/><br/>
Geodesic domes incorporate the <b>strength</b>
of a strong arch shape, and they're also made up of many triangles. Pair domes
with triangles, and you have one extremely durable structure. Much of that <b>durability</b> results from the
characteristics of triangles, which are the superheroes of shapes. Triangles
are the strongest shape because they have fixed angles and don't distort very
easily. <br/><br/>
The low quantity of materials necessary for geodesic domes, matched with their
durability and good looks, means they've found their way into places all over
the world and into Our Dream!</p>
<p><b><big>How We Have Done So Far</big></b></p>
<p>We have consulted with local natural builder, Ben Graham, to get a clear
idea of materials and costs. Materials will include lumber from a local mill
(Fontaine’s in East Montpelier, VT) for floor, frame, plywood, shingles and
shelving. We have another builder friend who has offered us his sizable
discount at local lumberyard. Other materials will include windows, door, woodstove,
lighting and solar electric system, insulation. </p>
<p>Labor! <b>We plan to do most of the work
ourselves</b>, with some work exchange students and the occasional work party.
However, we will need professional support at certain stages and some of the
money raised will go toward paying our builder friends.  </p>
<p>We have already co-created so much since we moved here, and it has all
happened because of our vision and the loving support of our local and extended
community. Last year we kicked off our fundraising locally and raised $3,000
with two great events; a BBQ localvore dinner and silent auction, and a two
part series in Celtic Shamanism taught by our esteemed colleague Meri Fowler of
Sacred Cauldron in Montreal.  This money has allowed us to rent an auger,
to buy the footers and platform, brackets and joists.  <b>We broke ground and started building.</b> 
See pictures in our video of the beautiful mandala we created, plus our home

<b><big>Let's Build a Dome!</big></b><br/><br/><p><b>Assuming we meet

If we do not meet our full funding goal here, we will continue with other
avenues of fundraising until we have manifested our dream! </p>
<p>Our vision is great but our personal resources are limited. We are
organized, thrifty and determined and we cannot do this alone! With your

<h3>My Story</h3>
<p>Dear friends, family, and possible contributors<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>As many of you know I will be graduating this May from the University of Miami's BM/BFA Musical Theater program. The University of Miami as many know is on the top 100 list of most expensive colleges.</p>
<p>Growing up I went to performance programs for all my k-12 education - the highlight of which was New World School of the Arts in Downtown Miami. I've been singing since before I can remember and fell in love with theater when my mom took me to see Les Mis when it came to the Broward Center for the Performing Arts in 6th grade and I first heard Eponine sing. <br/></p>
<p>Being in the arts has shaped every part of who I am. At home I'm different from every member of my family simply because all of my views and my personality has been incredibly crafted by a sort of liberal idealism encouraged to young artists to ""explore their imagination"" or ""reach to the extremities of your emotions"" - things most people think is fruity junk but to me is what this world needs. I think this world needs people whose ""realism"" is equally paired with imagination, creativity, and artistry. <br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>But whatever you believe about artists and why they do what they do - I know that when I was given the choice to go to state school and study something ACADEMIC on a full ride I opted instead to go to a private school that allowed me the opportunity be myself and the opportunity to get the training to pursue what I really want to do with my life. </p>
<p>But for every name on a Broadway playbill or actors in a movie there are millions of people who didn't get that job and who work every day just to get enough to pay the rent. I KNEW that getting into this - and trust me it won't deter me from pounding the pavement to get to an audition everyday for the rest of my life. This would just help me jump start repaying the loans i took for school so my actual income I make otherwise can go toward moving to NYC.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>The Eighth Annual Memphis Children’s Theatre Festival will take place May 24th and 25<sup>th</sup>, 2013 featuring children's theatre performances from some of Tennessee’s finest professional theatre companies, local community theatres, area schools and many more. The performances incorporate a variety of performance styles such as dance, mime, mask work, music, physical theatre, and storytelling. The festival also features workshops with local theatre artists, interactive visual arts experiences, and featured performances by area youth. </p>
<p>Since 2006, VOTS has hosted this weekend-long event both in and around The McCoy Theatre on the Rhodes College campus over Memorial Day weekend. The Festival kicks-off Friday evening with an opening night debut performance of a new children’s play performed by VOTS interns, followed by a post show celebration on the festival grounds. The next day, the festival opens its doors from 9:00am until 5:00pm and features over a dozen performances, and activity stations that provide young people with many opportunities to engage in a wide variety of workshops taught by skilled teaching artists</p>
</div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The Festival places special emphasis on great literature and storytelling from diverse southern perspectives. The event features new work from Voices of the South’s  intern company, performances and workshops from a wide range of local arts groups, and spotlights the work of individual performing/teaching artists from the Mid-South as well.</p>
<p>Affordable programming specifically designed for families is still somewhat rare in Memphis. There are no other projects that offer a theatre festival experience of this kind. In fact, there are still very few like it in the United States. Based on data collected via exit surveys over the past two years, the festival has proven to be one of the arts events attended by many families throughout the year. This is due to the affordability and the wide variety of family friendly programming. It is clear that excellence, education, and affordability is important to our community. The Festival is an important arts portal and will connect families to the VOTS mission and the larger role that the arts play in our region.</p>
<p>The Memphis Children’s Theatre Festival is a PAY WHAT YOU CAN event, creating greater accessibility for area families. In past years the festival has reached an estimated 1,200 underserved individuals. Most of these underserved were children. (An estimated 700 attendees were minority. 300 attendees were seniors.) Based on our year-long marketing efforts, we expect this growth to continue.</p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The 2012 Memphis Children’s Theatre Festival is showing progress with increased sponsorship, new private donors, a dramatic increase in in-kind donations and an overwhelming response from the community at large. Voices of the South is committed to engaging this energy, and anticipates significant growth over the next five years.</p>
<p>Our goal is to keep this festival a ""Pay What You Can"" event that makes the arts accessible to everyone, regardless of ecomonic contraints. With your donation, you will help us develop new workshops, purchase supplies, and pay artists. By donating today, you may take advantage of a series of ""perks"" ranging from posters and photo albums to having a slab of Memphis-style BBQ Ribs delivered straight to your front door!  Please note the list of ""perks"" on the right side of this webpage.</p>

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p> Hi we are a group of artists formed by Paola, Gerardo and Amadeo. A graphic designer, an architect and a filmmaker that are very concerned about the present social situation in Mexico, and we are convinced that the future relies on children. We strongly believe that education and a sense of community are the keys for a better and more balanced world. That is why we have been doing this program for children's development using creativity as the essential means for self transformation and community self-awareness. </p>
<p>We are using Art as our own personal foundation, for the realization of this special place. A place specially made for kids and by kids. This will serve them as an example to know that they are capable of changing reality.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Dreams shape the world. But they wont fly without wings.</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
Most of public schools in Mexico don't have what we think are the most important things for children's development. Very rarely children are taught to express themselves, as well as encouraged to be proud of their identity. As a result of this, they grow up forming communities that lack of self confidence.<br/><br/>The program is made for children of 10 to 12 years old. Fifth and sixth grade of primary school.<br/><br/> What Learning to Fly (children's development program) wants to achieve, is to give these children the alternative to have a space where they can believe in themselves, by learning new ways of expression, and giving them the chance to succeed in their own personal quests. Providing them the means to portray their reality and the possible ways to change and solve their problems. Creativity in action takes the one who uses it into a new perspective where everything can be possible.<br/><br/>Right now the program is just operating in one public school. But with your help we will be able to expand in the near future to other schools, and continue helping the kids to spread their wings.</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need.</h3>
<span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Basically </span>what we need is funds to buy all the artistic tools and necessary things to complete the program.<br/><br/>+FIRST PHASE: The Factory of tales.<br/><br/>In this phase the kids learn to tell stories. They are encouraged to say what they want to say, in the way they want to say it. Using means such as, photographs, video, writing, painting, or even the creation of toys. They are taught about color, drawing, painting, cardboard construction. Surrounded by activities and experiences that makes them be closer as human beings. With all this they become more aware of their identity and the needs of their fellow class mates. A feeling of belonging and self-identification with community is produced.<br/> <br/>Money will be used on this phase for:<br/><br/>Art Materials, such as pencils, paint, cardboard.<br/>Wood for making shelves.<br/>Paper, canvases.<br/>Trow away cameras.<br/>A video projector.<br/><br/>+SECOND PHASE: The magic orchard<br/><br/>The children will learn to make a house made green roof. Planting seeds to have community owned growth veggies. And plant trees to reforest near areas. Together with fun activities the children will build their green shelter, and learn about human equilibrium with nature.<br/><br/>Money will be used on this phase for:<br/><br/>Seeds, pots, black soil. Metal wire to make divisions between plantations. <br/>Plastic container to make fertile soil from organic waste of the school. <br/><br/>+THIRD PHASE: The all-together-dream Mural.<br/><br/>All the participants on the program including teachers and children, will get together to shape a communal image in a wall of the school. Where they will express their feelings about the whole experience. Using all kinds of visual materials. Leaving on the school a trace of a live work of art, an impression of the magic of communal work. A memory engraved more than just in a school wall, in the souls of these Winged Kids.<br/><br/>Money will be used on this phase for:<br/>Paint, cement, recycled plastic bags, plasticine, natural made colors, etc.<br/><br/>+FOURTH PHASE: Camping.<br/><br/>We will take the children to an open air experience. To stay 5 days in contact with nature. Having activities that will make them more aware towards the problems we face as human race on Earth. This will be the closing event for the program this academic year. This is the way we will say good bye to this 6th grade primary school Kids. Sending them to Secondary School were each one will go to a different one. But hopefully creating a bond for a lifetime. The bond of The Winged Kids Legion.<br/><br/>Money will be used on this phase for:<br/>Transportation, Food, Tents, Medicines, and other travel expenses.  <br/><br/><br/>
<h3>You can help by...</h3>
<br/>We only need 3000 people to donate one dollar each. We dont think thats too difficult, do you? but you can contribute  from one dollar to a thousand it is up to you. Just think about this posibility of donating just one dollar, and you will become our hero today. Now if you donate more you will no just be a hero but you will be granted wings. But if you cant spend any, you can spread the word. Remember that pasion is contagious. If you feel passionate about the ways to make childrens life more exiting talk to other about Learning to Fly Childrens Development Program. The Kids will be grateful.<br/><br/>Take a look for the wonderful perks we have for you!!!<br/><span lang=""EN-US"" style=""font-family: Geneva;""> </span><span style=""font-weight: bold;""><br/><br/><br/></span>

Our Story
 Hi we are a group of artists formed by Paola, Gerardo and Amadeo. A graphic designer, an architect and a filmmaker that are very concerned about the present social situation in Mexico, and we are convinced that the future relies on children. We strongly believe that education and a sense of community are the keys for a better and more balanced world. That is why we have been doing this program for children's development using creativity as the essential means for self transformation and community self-awareness. 
We are using Art as our own personal foundation, for the realization of this special place. A place specially made for kids and by kids. This will serve them as an example to know that they are capable of changing reality.
 
Dreams shape the world. But they wont fly without wings.
 


The Impact
Most of public schools in Mexico don't have what we think are the most important things for children's development. Very rarely children are taught to express themselves, as well as encouraged to be proud of their identity. As a result of this, they grow up forming communities that lack of self confidence.The program is made for children of 10 to 12 years old. Fifth and sixth grade of primary school. What Learning to Fly (children's development program) wants to achieve, is to give these children the alternative to have a space where they can believe in themselves, by learning new ways of expression, and giving them the chance to succeed in their own personal quests. Providing them the means to portray their reality and the possible ways to change and solve their problems. Creativity in action takes the one who uses it into a new perspective where everything can be possible.Right now the program is just operating in one public school. But with your help we will be able to expand in the near future to other schools, and continue helping the kids to spread their wings.

What We Need.
Basically what we need is funds to buy all the artistic tools and necessary things to complete the program.+FIRST PHASE: The Factory of tales.In this phase the kids learn to tell stories. They are encouraged to say what they want to say, in the way they want to say it. Using means such as, photographs, video, writing, painting, or even the creation of toys. They are taught about color, drawing, painting, cardboard construction. Surrounded by activities and experiences that makes them be closer as human beings. With all this they become more aware of their identity and the needs of their fellow class mates. A feeling of belonging and self-identification with community is produced. Money will be used on this phase for:Art Materials, such as pencils, paint, cardboard.Wood for making shelves.Paper, canvases.Trow away cameras.A video projector.+SECOND PHASE: The magic orchardThe children will learn to make a house made green roof. Planting seeds to have community owned growth veggies. And plant trees to reforest near areas. Together with fun activities the children will build their green shelter, and learn about human equilibrium with nature.Money will be used on this phase for:Seeds, pots, black soil. Metal wire to make divisions between plantations. Plastic container to make fertile soil from organic waste of the school. +THIRD PHASE: The all-together-dream Mural.All the participants on the program including teachers and children, will get together to shape a communal image in a wall of the school. Where they will express their feelings about the whole experience. Using all kinds of visual materials. Leaving on the school a trace of a live work of art, an impression of the magic of communal work. A memory engraved more than just in a school wall, in the souls of these Winged Kids.Money will be used on this phase for:Paint, cement, recycled plastic bags, plasticine, natural made colors, etc.+FOURTH PHASE: Camping.We will take the children to an open air experience. To stay 5 days in contact with nature. Having activities that will make them more aware towards the problems we face as human race on Earth. This will be the closing event for the program this academic year. This is the way we will say good bye to this 6th grade primary school Kids. Sending them to Secondary School were each one will go to a different one. But hopefully creating a bond for a lifetime. The bond of The Winged Kids Legion.Money will be used on this phase for:Transportation, Food, Tents, Medicines, and other travel expenses.  
You can help by...
We only need 3000 people to donate one dollar each. We dont think thats too difficult, do you? but you can contribute  from one dollar to a thousand it is up to you. Just think about this posibility of donating just one dollar, and you will become our hero today. Now if you donate more you will no just be a hero but you will be granted wings. But if you cant spend any, you can spread the word. Remember that pasion is contagious. If you feel passionate about the ways to make childrens life more exiting talk to other about Learning to Fly Childrens Development Program. The Kids will be grateful.Take a look for the wonderful perks we have for you!!! 
Nuestra Historia: Niños Voladores
 
Hola, somos un grupo de artistas conformado por Paola Pasapera, diseñadora gráfica, Gerardo Morales, arquitecto y Amadeo Marín, cineasta, y como a muchos nos preocupa  la situación actual en México. Creemos firmemente que la educación y el sentido de comunidad son las claves para tener un mundo mejor y más balanceado y, convencidos de que el futuro se encuentra en los niños, hemos diseñado y, ya aplicamos, el programa de desarrollo infantil, que hoy ponemos a su consideración. En este proyecto, la creatividad es herramienta esencial para lograr la auto transformación de los niños y ayudarlos a que tengan conciencia de que forman parte de la comunidad.
 
Nos valemos del arte como fundamento principal para la realización de este espacio. Un espacio especialmente hecho por niños y para ellos. Aquí, se darán cuenta de sus capacidades y de cómo, con ellas, pueden cambiar su realidad.
 
Los sueños le dan forma al mundo. Pero no podrán volar si no les damos alas.
 
 
 
El impacto
 
La mayoría de escuelas públicas en México no tienen lo que pensamos, son las cosas más importantes en el desarrollo de los niños. Muy rara vez se les enseña a expresarse y tampoco se les motiva para estar orgullosos de su propia identidad. El resultado es que crecen formando comunidades que carecen de confianza en sí mismas. 
 
 
Niños Voladores, Programa de Desarrollo Infantil, está diseñado para niños de entre 10 y 12 años que cursan quinto y sexto de primaria, respectivamente. 
Lo que queremos lograr, es ofrecerles la alternativa de tener un espacio donde puedan creer en sí mismos, aprendan nuevas formas de expresión y tengan la oportunidad de auto realizarse en sus aventuras personales.
 
 Se les provee de los medios para retratar su propia realidad y se les muestran los posibles caminos para cambiar y solucionar sus problemas. La creatividad puesta en acción lleva al niño a ver el mundo desde una nueva perspectiva donde todo es posible.
 
 
En este momento el programa solo se aplica en una  escuela pública. Con tu ayuda podremos expandirnos a otras escuelas y seguir con esta misión y ayudar a los niños a desplegar sus alas.
 
 
 
Lo que necesitamos.
 
Básicamente buscamos fondos para conseguir todas las herramientas artísticas necesarias para aplicar el programa y llevar a buen término esta obra. 
 
 
+ PRIMERA FASE: Taller de invención de cuentos.
 
En esta fase los niños aprenden a contar historias. Son animados a decir lo que desean y en la forma que ellos escojan. Pueden valerse de la fotografía, el video, la escritura, la pintura o hasta de la creación de juguetes. Se les enseña sobre el color, dibujo, pintura, construcción con cartón, etc. Se les rodea de actividades y experiencias que los unen como seres humanos, se convierten en personitas más conscientes de su identidad y de las necesidades de sus compañeros. Se busca provocar un sentimiento de pertenencia e identificación con la comunidad. 
 
Los fondos en esta etapa serán usados para:
 
Materiales de arte como lápices, pinturas, cartón.
Madera para construir libreros y repisas.
Papeles y lienzos.
Cámaras desechables y un proyector de video.
 
 
+ SEGUNDA FASE: El huerto Mágico.
 
 
Los niños aprenderán a hacer azoteas verdes. Plantarán y cosecharán vegetales para la comunidad. Árboles para reforestar áreas cercanas. Con actividades divertidas construirán su propio refugio verde para aprender sobre el equilibrio entre el ser humano y la naturaleza.
 
 
Los fondos en esta etapa serán usados para:
 
Semillas, macetas, tierra negra. Alambre para hacer divisiones entre plantaciones.
Contenedores de plástico para hacer tierra fértil con residuos orgánicos de la escuela.
 
 
 
+TERCERA FASE: Mural del sueño colectivo.
 
Todos los participantes en el programa, maestros y niños, se juntarán para dar forma a una imagen colectiva en una pared de la escuela. En ella expresarán sus sentimientos y sus experiencias en el programa. Usando toda clase de material visual dejarán en la escuela un rastro de su trabajo viviente. La impresión de la magia de la labor en comunidad. Una memoria grabada no solo en la pared de la escuela sino en el alma de cada uno de estos Niños Voladores.
 
 
Los fondos en esta etapa serán usados para:
 
Pintura, cemento, bolsas de plástico reusadas, plastilina, tintes naturales. 
 
 
+CUARTA FASE: Campamento.
 
Llevaremos a los niños a una experiencia de esparcimiento en el campo. Cinco días de contacto con la naturaleza. Actividad que los hará más conscientes de los problemas que como hombres y mujeres enfrentamos en la Tierra. Con esto se clausura el programa para los niños de sexto grado de primaria. Será su viaje de despedida y graduación. Creando un lazo entre ellos, que durará para siempre. El lazo de la Legión de los Niños Voladores.
 
Los fondos en esta etapa serán usados para:
 
Transporte, comida, tiendas de campaña, medicamentos y otros gastos de viaje.
 
 
 
Tú puedes ayudar...
 
El programa solo necesita de 3000 personas que se vuelvan héroes por un día donando un dólar cada uno. No creemos que sea tan difícil o ¿tú si lo crees?.
           Tu contribución puede ser a partir de un dólar y hasta lo que desees aportar. Eso depende de ti. Los niños te lo agradecerán y apreciarán cada centavo. Ahora que si quieres donar más de un dólar no solo te convertirás en un héroe para estos niños, sino que además te crecerán alas.
 
Pero si no puedes aportar dinero, también puedes ayudar corriendo la voz. Recuerda que la pasión es contagiosa. Si ayudar a que la vida de los niños sea más emocionante te apasiona,  habla con tus amigos sobre el Programa de Desarrollo Infantil: Niños Voladores. 
 
 
Te aseguro que los niños se llenarán de sonrisas.

This industry is the next step in the evolution of education and will aim to

<p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/290711/files/20140104063449-School_of_Atlantis_Logo.png?1388846089"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p>Atlantis is currently in the start-up (infancy) stages of its
lifecycle, but has gained a large amount of support to date. We, the Atlantis
team, have been working on educational programs and products for over 10 years.
We are extremely excited about continuing to develop this school and bring the
educational revolution to the world. </p><p>
</p><h4><b>The Game (Interactive Gaming)</b></h4>
<p>Atlantis
is a world like no other. It is a world where all things educational and
inspiring come to life - where students can dive into the ancient historical
worlds that are long lost, complete quests and assessments that teach
educational concepts, socialise with other students from around the world, and
even trade and learn the concept of money and economics. The possibilities with
virtual schools are endless and Atlantis will be just that; an endless world
where education and learning is the game. </p>
<p>The
Atlantis world is divided into sections, wherein each section represents a
school year. In these sections of the map the students will have the ability to
interact with quest-giving none player characters (NPCs). The quests will have
educational outcomes for students that reinforce the theories being taught in
class. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/290723/files/20140104064247-Map.png?1388846567"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p>
<p>Students will have the
opportunity to design and customise their own “avatars” (game characters),
allowing for an interactive online school experience, which will increase
student participation and engagement. Research has shown that the utilisation
of Avatars in online education allows an experience of being present similar to
that of real life interaction. With the use of avatars, students will be able to
interact throughout the whole Atlantis world: undertaking assessments, quests,
research, and social interactions.   </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/290724/files/20140104064336-Avatar_Concepts.jpg?1388846616"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>The Atlantis world will
be made up of visually pleasing landscapes, cities, oceans, etc. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/290725/files/20140104064431-atlantis_background.png?1388846671"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
In the center of Atlantis will be the School of Atlantis, where students
will attend class. Once it is time for class, a message will appear on their
computer screen, phone or tablet informing them that it is time to head to the
school for their scheduled class.<br/><p></p><p>
</p><h4><b>The School (Education)</b></h4>
<p>The classes in the School of Atlantis will be held in a virtual
classroom, allowing students access to everything in-game where they will
interact with real teachers who are academically certified. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/290728/files/20140104064540-Classroom.png?1388846740"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>The Atlantis team will be looking to create relationships with
international education bodies such as the Cambridge International Schooling
system, the International Baccalaureate (IB) Schooling system or each respective
country’s educational bodies. </p>
<p>Students will be able to
enrol into the School of Atlantis from grade/year 5 (or the respective country’s
grading equivalent).  Students will be
provided with the software and learning materials upon enrolment. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/290729/files/20140104064624-Application_Pack.png?1388846784"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>The classes will be
scheduled on student timetables, showing students exactly what time they need
to log on and head to their classes on that day. The virtual school will work
just like most schools; only this school is virtual and will innovate the way education
is provided throughout the world. </p>
<b>All students who graduate from the School of Atlantis will gain their
schooling certificate just like any other registered school throughout the
world. <span><br/></span></b>
<h3><b><br/></b></h3><h3><b>How can you help?</b></h3>
<h4>
<b>Back us!</b><br/>
</h4>
<p>Get behind the revolution and be part of creating the future of
education. </p>
<p></p>
<h4><b>Share!</b></h4>
<p>To make Atlantis happen, we need awareness and for people to put
their hands up and say, “We want to be part of this revolution because education
needs a change!” The first place to start is simply by making some noise and sharing
our Indiegogo page on Facebook, Twitter, Linkdin, Tumblr etc. Help us gain
awareness, ultimately leading to funding the Beta and moving education into the
new millennia.  </p>

<p>As you can imagine, the School of Atlantis is no small feat and
will require a large team of experts to pull this off. Although the current
Atlantis team has a broad range of knowledge, we lack certain skills that will
be required across the board. The funding will be used to hire experts in game
development, coding, design, sound production, teaching, research and
development, historians, educational consultants and so forth. The funding will
cover licensing, external fees and all those other boring business expenses. We
will also require hardware (more computers) and larger servers to hold our
creation. The costs to develop a virtual school such as the School of Atlantis
is not as small as we would like it to be, but it is still reasonable for the
amount of change we can create throughout the world. </p>
<p>If we don’t reach our entire goal, the funding that has been
attracted will go towards creating a small sample beta to pitch towards venture
capital funds, Angel Investors or further crowd sourcing options. We truly
believe in this idea and will not rest until the School of Atlantis is up and
running - helping to change education throughout the world. </p>
<p>The Atlantis team are big believers in a few things, such as: “If
you do what you’ve always done, you’ll always get what you’ve always got,”
(Mark Twain) and the theory that states, “What if the solution to the world’s
problems lay dormant in the mind of someone who can’t access education?” Larger
corporations do not own our company, and thus we plan on keeping control to
ensure that the school is always about the student and not about the money. </p>
<h3><b>Rewards</b></h3>
<p>Check
back here for updates on what the rewards will (potentially) look like!</p>
<h3><b>FAQ?</b></h3>
<p><b>Will the students gain an
internationally recognised high school (or respective country’s equivalent) certificate?
</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>Yes,
the School of Atlantis will be creating partnerships with internationally
accredited schooling bodies to certify students. </p>
<p><b>Do students still need to undertake
exams? </b></p>
<p></p>
<p>Yes,
all students will still need to undertake exams just like any other brick and
mortar, distance, or virtual school. 

</p><p><b><span>How expensive will the school fees
be? </span></b></p>
<p></p>
<p>We
are aiming to have school fees around the same price as the country’s public
school equivalent to make the school affordable for all students. </p>
<p><b>Will there be in-game rewards? </b></p>
<p></p>
<p>Yes,
students will gain experience points and in-game currency from completing
quests. This can be used to purchase items for avatars, such as: clothes,
vehicles, property, and others (to be announced). </p>
<p><b>Will students be attending school from
their homes?</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>Yes,
students will attend school from their home, as the School of Atlantis is an
online virtual school. However, if there was enough demand, tutor centers may
be set up for students to attend school in particular situations where the
child cannot be left alone in the home. </p>
<p><b>Will people who don’t attend the
school be able to play the game? </b></p>
<p></p>
<p>No,
the School for Atlantis is for school students only. This is for safety and
learning purposes.</p>
<p><b>How will bullying be monitored?</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>If
a student encounters bullying, they will have the option to utilize the “Report
Bullying” function, which will alert a monitoring teacher. This teacher can
automatically message the student who is responsible for the bullying and give
them a warning. A chat log will be recorded and sent to the student’s parents
so that all parties are aware of what has occurred. Students will also have a “Block
Student” option so they can no longer interact with each other outside of class
times. </p>
<p><b>What if you receive more funding than
you have asked for?</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>The
funding we have asked for is enough to cover the cost of the first Beta. If we
receive more funding then we have asked for, we will put it all towards the
development of the final polished School of Atlantis. The first launch of the
school will be for grade/year 5 students only, which will give us the necessary
time to develop the next section of the map for the grade/year 6 students and
so on. The excess will go straight into further creation and improvement of the
school.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>What about sports and out-door activities?</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>Students
will be required to be a part of an approved sports activity in their local
area, and this will make up for the sport curriculum part of their schooling
certificate. </p>
<p><b>How will the classes work with
multiple time zones?</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>Every
class will be recorded and stored in the school library for students to access
if they miss a class due to time differences. We will also have different teams
of teachers who work in certain time zones for certain countries. </p>
<p><b>Will the classes be taught in
different languages? </b></p>
<p></p>
<p>Apart
from classes that are specific to language, not straight away. The School of Atlantis will initially be
taught in English, just like most international schools.</p>
<p><b>Can I purchase more than one perk/reward?
</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>You
can buy as many as you like! The more support for the school, the better. :)</p>
<p>If
you have more questions for us, just ask! </p>
<p>Thanks
for supporting and sharing, everyone. We really hope you see and feel the dream
that is the School of Atlantis.</p><p></p></div>","The School of Atlantis VisionEducation needs a revolution, and for us, the School of Atlantis is the next stage in the evolution of education.

allowing for an interactive online school experience, which will increase
student participation and engagement. Research has shown that the utilisation
of Avatars in online education allows an experience of being present similar to
that of real life interaction. With the use of avatars, students will be able to
interact throughout the whole Atlantis world: undertaking assessments, quests,
research, and social interactions.   

The Atlantis world will
be made up of visually pleasing landscapes, cities, oceans, etc. 

In the center of Atlantis will be the School of Atlantis, where students
will attend class. Once it is time for class, a message will appear on their
computer screen, phone or tablet informing them that it is time to head to the
school for their scheduled class.
The School (Education)
The classes in the School of Atlantis will be held in a virtual
classroom, allowing students access to everything in-game where they will
interact with real teachers who are academically certified. 

The Atlantis team will be looking to create relationships with
international education bodies such as the Cambridge International Schooling
system, the International Baccalaureate (IB) Schooling system or each respective
country’s educational bodies. 
Students will be able to
enrol into the School of Atlantis from grade/year 5 (or the respective country’s
grading equivalent).  Students will be
provided with the software and learning materials upon enrolment. 

The classes will be
scheduled on student timetables, showing students exactly what time they need
to log on and head to their classes on that day. The virtual school will work
just like most schools; only this school is virtual and will innovate the way education
is provided throughout the world. 
All students who graduate from the School of Atlantis will gain their
schooling certificate just like any other registered school throughout the
world. 
How can you help?

Back us!

Get behind the revolution and be part of creating the future of
education. 

Share!
To make Atlantis happen, we need awareness and for people to put
their hands up and say, “We want to be part of this revolution because education
needs a change!” The first place to start is simply by making some noise and sharing
our Indiegogo page on Facebook, Twitter, Linkdin, Tumblr etc. Help us gain
awareness, ultimately leading to funding the Beta and moving education into the
new millennia.  
Ask us questions and
give us your ideas for the school!

Go to our website, Facebook, Twitter or Tumblr and leave your
feedback and ideas.

https://twitter.com/SchoolAtlantis
www.schoolofatlantis.tumblr.comWhere does the funding go?
As you can imagine, the School of Atlantis is no small feat and
will require a large team of experts to pull this off. Although the current
Atlantis team has a broad range of knowledge, we lack certain skills that will
be required across the board. The funding will be used to hire experts in game
development, coding, design, sound production, teaching, research and
development, historians, educational consultants and so forth. The funding will
cover licensing, external fees and all those other boring business expenses. We
will also require hardware (more computers) and larger servers to hold our
creation. The costs to develop a virtual school such as the School of Atlantis
is not as small as we would like it to be, but it is still reasonable for the
amount of change we can create throughout the world. 
If we don’t reach our entire goal, the funding that has been
attracted will go towards creating a small sample beta to pitch towards venture
capital funds, Angel Investors or further crowd sourcing options. We truly
believe in this idea and will not rest until the School of Atlantis is up and
running - helping to change education throughout the world. 
The Atlantis team are big believers in a few things, such as: “If
you do what you’ve always done, you’ll always get what you’ve always got,”
(Mark Twain) and the theory that states, “What if the solution to the world’s
problems lay dormant in the mind of someone who can’t access education?” Larger
corporations do not own our company, and thus we plan on keeping control to
ensure that the school is always about the student and not about the money. 
Rewards
Check
back here for updates on what the rewards will (potentially) look like!
FAQ?
Will the students gain an
internationally recognised high school (or respective country’s equivalent) certificate?


Yes,
the School of Atlantis will be creating partnerships with internationally
accredited schooling bodies to certify students. 
Do students still need to undertake
exams? 

Yes,
all students will still need to undertake exams just like any other brick and
mortar, distance, or virtual school. 

How expensive will the school fees
be? 

We
are aiming to have school fees around the same price as the country’s public
school equivalent to make the school affordable for all students. 
Will there be in-game rewards? 

Yes,
students will gain experience points and in-game currency from completing
quests. This can be used to purchase items for avatars, such as: clothes,
vehicles, property, and others (to be announced). 
Will students be attending school from
their homes?

Yes,
students will attend school from their home, as the School of Atlantis is an
online virtual school. However, if there was enough demand, tutor centers may
be set up for students to attend school in particular situations where the
child cannot be left alone in the home. 
Will people who don’t attend the
school be able to play the game? 

No,
the School for Atlantis is for school students only. This is for safety and
learning purposes.
How will bullying be monitored?

If
a student encounters bullying, they will have the option to utilize the “Report
Bullying” function, which will alert a monitoring teacher. This teacher can
automatically message the student who is responsible for the bullying and give
them a warning. A chat log will be recorded and sent to the student’s parents
so that all parties are aware of what has occurred. Students will also have a “Block
Student” option so they can no longer interact with each other outside of class
times. 
What if you receive more funding than
you have asked for?

The
funding we have asked for is enough to cover the cost of the first Beta. If we
receive more funding then we have asked for, we will put it all towards the
development of the final polished School of Atlantis. The first launch of the
school will be for grade/year 5 students only, which will give us the necessary
time to develop the next section of the map for the grade/year 6 students and
so on. The excess will go straight into further creation and improvement of the
school.

What about sports and out-door activities?

Students
will be required to be a part of an approved sports activity in their local
area, and this will make up for the sport curriculum part of their schooling
certificate. 
How will the classes work with
multiple time zones?

Every
class will be recorded and stored in the school library for students to access
if they miss a class due to time differences. We will also have different teams
of teachers who work in certain time zones for certain countries. 
Will the classes be taught in
different languages? 

Apart
from classes that are specific to language, not straight away. The School of Atlantis will initially be
taught in English, just like most international schools.
Can I purchase more than one perk/reward?


You
can buy as many as you like! The more support for the school, the better. :)
If
you have more questions for us, just ask! 
Thanks
for supporting and sharing, everyone. We really hope you see and feel the dream
that is the School of Atlantis.",6.0,0,"1 Campaign

This summer I have been chosen among 5 other students from my college to travel to South Korea to participate in the Bahrom International Program. The goal of the student eschange program is to learn and experience first hand the people and culture of South Korea. I have been working hard not only in my academics but financially as well to raise funds for the trip but I need your help as well. Traveling has also been an interest of mine; last year I had explored the opportunity to travel to Australia to study abroad for the semester but had the misfortune of tearing my ACL in my left knee during the summer before the planned trip.

<p>We are Priyasha Foundation; our mission is to empower marginalized women in the developing world through jewelry income generation projects.  Our goal is to change lives by teaching entrepreneurial skills.  For the past three years we've been working in India (and out of India, during the planning stages) on these jewelry income generation projects.</p>
<p>Because jewelers in India are traditionally men, it is not enough to simply teach the women a marketable skill. It is also necessary to build the infrastructure required to create jobs so they can apply these newly acquired skills.  A jewelry income generation project in the developing world is complicated, requires a large amount of resources, and takes several years to get off the ground.  It is a novel concept, but is a proven long lasting solution to ending poverty and sex trafficking.<br/></p>
<p>A jewelry income generation project helps girls to 
heal, express themselves and to gain confidence in learning.  It shows 
them that they hold value in the world.  A project like this is so much 
more than simply teaching a woman a marketable skill.   Women in India 
don't want a hand out, they want a leg up.  It is inspiring to us how 
hard these women will work to achieve their goals when given a chance.  
By empowering them and teaching a skill we can change lives and affect 
women for generations to come.  
</p>
<p>This coming fall and winter, Priyasha Foundation will return to India to
 build a permanent jewelry workshop/training center in Bangalore, 
India.  <br/></p>
<p>We can serve more women while conserving our resources by building a training center in a centralized location.  We spend the money one time on tools for one location and can partner with more NGO's and service more populations of women from one centralized location by having the women come to us.  <br/></p>
<p>We save time, money, energy, and resources, rather than spending the same amount of money on tools over and over again, setting up training centers within NGO's in different locations.</p>
<p>The workshop in Bangalore will serve as our base, so that in years to come, we can take our mobile jewelry kits to remote locations for future jewelry income generation projects.</p>

<p><br/></p>
</div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>With your support, we're asking for $25,000.00 to set up a full jewelry production studio and training center in Bangalore, India.  Please partner with us to empower women in India.</p>
<p>The money will be used for travel, studio rental and set up costs, and initial set up costs for the project.  Costs will include:  travel to India, room and board and travel expenses in India,  rental and deposit for studio space (in India, a full year's rental is the deposit amount), utilities for the space, up-fit of the space (mostly painting or minimal transformation), internet, a generator for power backup, a laptop for communication with the west and running the business part of the studio, possibly a simple camera for photographing the jewelry for the website and documentation of the projects, initial salary for a watchman and guard, studio manager (one of the girls from our previous projects is already trained for this position), initial training salary for the women, shipping the already donated and purchased tools to India, purchase of supplemental jewelry tools missing from tool donations or available only in India, initial jewelry line production costs--3-D printing and two sets of casting molds, casting of the sample pieces for the line, initial material and labor costs, broker, tariffs and export fees, website design and online sales marketing and web hosting fees, professional photography of the jewelry for the website, some simple jewelry display costs, bags, boxes, jewelry info cards, hang tag and corporate identity costs for the jewelry line, sales marketing costs, bazaar show fees for sales in India, show fees for US sales.   </p>
<p>We're going for broke here, and asking for our pie-in-the-sky fully funded set-up of the entire project in one pitch, rather than cobbling together small fundraisers and limping along.   There's nothing more frustrating than being in India, seeing real needs and being frustrated and unable to help or move forward due to lack of funding.   We've been working hard behind the scenes for two years planning all aspects of this project, doing budgets, revising plans, working out problems, gathering tools, designing the jewelry line,  There is no money in this budget for personal salaries. or overhead.  ALL funds for this project are going directly to the girls and the set up of the studio and set up costs.  </p>
<p>It is our dream to not only make our goal, but to surpass our goal!  The more money we raise, the more women we can help.  This is a multi-year, multi-stage project, that will have real long term lasting effects to helping to solve the problems associated with poverty in the developing world.  However, even if we don't reach our entire goal, we will fund and fulfill the aspects of the project that are funded.  We maintain milestones and goals, and each one we reach in another step forward in helping our girls.</p>
<p><b>**PLEASE NOTE:</b>  If you are a foundation or charity that can only donate through a tax deductible organization, we are in the process of partnering with an organization that can accept tax deductible donations on our behalf.  You can email us at Priyashafoundation@yahoo.com or at priyashafoundation@gmail.com to discuss your needs.  The link for tax deductions will be posted soon.<br/></p>As a thank you for your donations for partnering with us to change girls lives in the developing world, we have some really cool perks with an Indian flavor (please see the list of Perks).  No donation is too big or too small, your donation goes a long long way in India.  Thanks for your support!<br/>
</div> <div> <h3>Your Impact</h3>
<p>We have been working in and for India for three years.  We started as a simple volunteer hope project and through our partnership with the US and Indian community, we have evolved into Priyasha.  Along the way, your support in a myriad of ways, from contributing to our campaigns, organizing fundraisers, volunteering services, donating tools, or lending moral support has contributed to our success and allowed us to help these girls.  It is a true partnership of a global community that will enable these women to survive and thrive.  We are standing in this moment now, ready to build a training center because of you.  <br/></p>
<p>A jewelry income generation project is a novel approach but a proven long lasting solution to ending poverty in the developing world.  We believe that we may be the first artisan jewelry income generation project in the south of India of this focus, scope and scale.  Our center will enable us to train 30 women from three local NGO's, and give advanced training to the girls from our first project.  <br/></p>
<p>More importantly, the center will allow these women to become trainers and entrepreneurs in their own communities, empowering them to change their own lives, by earning money and investing in education for themselves and their daughters and affecting their families for generations to come.<br/></p>
<p>We completed a successful six month test income generation project as a preliminary to two years of planning for this phase of the project.  We have everything we need to start a training center--all the pieces are in place, ready to go, all we need is your funding support!<br/></p>
<p></p>
</div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>We are fully aware of the risks, challenges and obstacles that occur by working in the developing world because we have experienced them first-hand.  From these experiences, we have learned how to design studios and projects with limited resources in places lacking infrastructure like power, water, and internet.  We know how to avoid situations where, cheating, scandal and blocking our projects may occur, and how to work with the local community to solve problems, and overcome misunderstandings due to cultural differences.  <br/></p>
<p>Our team includes a professional jeweler with 23 years of experience in setting up and running production studios and jewelry businesses.  We have six months of on the ground experience, which cultivated professional contacts in the local jewelry, NGO and ex-pat community.  This community is always willing to lend a hand to help us solve problems.  We have 3 potential NGO's with whom to partner, a local product designer on our team, and many more friends and contacts on whom we can trust and rely.  Most importantly, we have the full support of the local community.</p>
<p>Ultimately, in India, one must remain flexible and patient, and constantly adjust when obstacles and problems occur.  We feel confident that with the community support and our contacts and resources, we will be successful.<br/></p>
</div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p>Please contribute to our campaign to help us reach our goal.  We are grateful for all contributions, even the small amounts add up.  Thank you!<br/></p>

We have been working in and for India for three years.  We started as a simple volunteer hope project and through our partnership with the US and Indian community, we have evolved into Priyasha.  Along the way, your support in a myriad of ways, from contributing to our campaigns, organizing fundraisers, volunteering services, donating tools, or lending moral support has contributed to our success and allowed us to help these girls.  It is a true partnership of a global community that will enable these women to survive and thrive.  We are standing in this moment now, ready to build a training center because of you.  
A jewelry income generation project is a novel approach but a proven long lasting solution to ending poverty in the developing world.  We believe that we may be the first artisan jewelry income generation project in the south of India of this focus, scope and scale.  Our center will enable us to train 30 women from three local NGO's, and give advanced training to the girls from our first project.  
More importantly, the center will allow these women to become trainers and entrepreneurs in their own communities, empowering them to change their own lives, by earning money and investing in education for themselves and their daughters and affecting their families for generations to come.
We completed a successful six month test income generation project as a preliminary to two years of planning for this phase of the project.  We have everything we need to start a training center--all the pieces are in place, ready to go, all we need is your funding support!

  Risks & Challenges
We are fully aware of the risks, challenges and obstacles that occur by working in the developing world because we have experienced them first-hand.  From these experiences, we have learned how to design studios and projects with limited resources in places lacking infrastructure like power, water, and internet.  We know how to avoid situations where, cheating, scandal and blocking our projects may occur, and how to work with the local community to solve problems, and overcome misunderstandings due to cultural differences.  
Our team includes a professional jeweler with 23 years of experience in setting up and running production studios and jewelry businesses.  We have six months of on the ground experience, which cultivated professional contacts in the local jewelry, NGO and ex-pat community.  This community is always willing to lend a hand to help us solve problems.  We have 3 potential NGO's with whom to partner, a local product designer on our team, and many more friends and contacts on whom we can trust and rely.  Most importantly, we have the full support of the local community.
Ultimately, in India, one must remain flexible and patient, and constantly adjust when obstacles and problems occur.  We feel confident that with the community support and our contacts and resources, we will be successful.

<h2>Mason Needs a New Laptop 4 High School</h2>
<p>Mason is my nephew and he lives with his grandparents. He has been living with them for 11 years and they are raising him while living on social security which doesn't leave much money for anything more than the basics. Mason is a fine young man who enjoys helping other people, reading, computer games and surfing the internet, and he wants to become a teacher after college.</p>
<p>He is a Junior, gets excellent grades in school, polite, willing to lend a hand when needed, and is a delight to have in his classes according to his teachers. He utlimately wants to attend college and pursue teaching career in either either Math or Science. </p>
<p>I have a great respect for my parents for dedicating their lives to raising Mason and I think getting Mason a computer would be a nice way to give something to him that they are unable to afford.</p>
<p>I am encouraging everyone to donate something and make this a gift from everyone who loves Mason or wants to see that Mason get a good education so he can become a Teacher someday and give back to our future children. </p>
<h3>In summary: Mason is a great kid and very deserving of a new laptop computer to help him High School and get ready for college. </h3>
<p>Thanks in advance to anyone who helps with donations to helping get Mason a new computer. Whether we get to our goal or not I intend to purchase him a new laptop.</p>

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>The Damian Carmona Primary School in Sayulita Nayarit is filled with 350 bright and beautiful students, sweet and eager to learn.  A local organization, Grupo Pro Sayulita, raised money to build a library in the school.  This is the first library the town of Sayulita has ever had.  This year I had the pleasure of opening the doors of the library for most of the school year.  I was overwhelmed with students coming in to exchange their books, sometimes two and three times a day.  During recess, I keep the doors open to use the room and various donated supplies to run an art program for the children.  Most days there is standing room only, as the children are able to explore their creativity with art supplies many have never had the opportunity to use.  The library has become a place that offers not only access to information, by way of books but I also bring my computer in with me, connected to a neighbor's wireless signal to give both the students and teachers the ability to utilize the internet, some for the first time.  I would love to see more computers at the school, so they can continue to experience the benefits of easy access to the internet.  As much as possible, I keep the room stocked with water, fruit and healthy snacks for the children who find themselves in school without lunch or money; something that happens far too often.  The Damian Carmona Primary School Library is a place for students to discover their true capabilities: through access to resources, tutoring or simply seeing to it that no student is trying to learn on an empty stomach. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The program is already a success by way of the generous support from GPS and the local Sayulita community.  We can keep our doors open and many wonderful people have donated materials, time and food to the students.  However my goal is to fill the shelves with books for the kids.  I would love to be able to provide paper and pencils free of charge.  I want to be able to keep the doors open after school so the children have the opportunity to do homework with tutors, bringing up standardized test scores that are some of the lowest in Mexico.  I want to see at least 5 computers in the room with internet access, connected to a laser printer.  When I first opened the doors, one of the second grade girls asked me what the library was for.  I told her it was there so that she and her classmates could learn to read, to be creative and that if she ever needed help with her homework, while the doors were open, someone would be there to help her.  She paused a moment, taking in what I had said.  Then she looked up at me with big, watery eyes, and ran forward to embrace me.  ""Muchas gracias, Teacher.  Muchas gracias.""  How can we quantify the impact of even one student's mind expanding, feeling believed in or not being hungry?  It is my goal to help each one of these students become aware of the possibilities that are open to them and provide the resources needed to become who ever it is they want to be.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>We need computers, books, paper, pens, paints, tape, pencil sharpeners, snacks, water and tutors.  The beautiful thing about donating to this program is that it doesn't take much to make a difference.  For example, $5 will buy a stack of white paper that equals 500 kids getting to explore their creativity.  This is a school with virtually nothing.  The children's family pays for things like classroom cleaning supplies, filtered water and toilet paper.  There isn't soap in the bathrooms.  These things may not seem very expensive but stocking a school with supplies for hundreds of children more than 40 weeks a year really starts to add up.  It is not an exaggeration to say that every penny counts.  Give what you can.  I promise you  each one of these beautiful little people is worth it.  </p>

<p>Dear Viewer-</p>

<p>My name is Hannah McKee and I am hoping to travel to Europe with the People to People Student Ambassador Programs.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(To learn more about the trip: <a href=""http://peopletopeople.com/find/local/eu/celtic-cultures/1FD795BD-E9F2-E111-8FA6-0050569E31E3"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://peopletopeople.com/find/local/eu/celtic-...</a> )</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Backstory:</p>
<p>I am the youngest of thirteen children: ten girls and three boys. In my house I am the care-taker; I pack lunches, clean up, babysit nieces and nephews, and create family fun activities. Currently I am a junior in high school and a freshman in college. I am training to become a high school math teacher.</p>
<p>Why:</p>
<p>This Program would open so many doors for me. It would teach me things I couldn’t possible pick up in a classroom. (Repelling off a castle: 101?) People to People is a program that would help me get into great colleges with amazing scholarships. Plus, the people I meet will become my friends for a lifetime.</p>
<p>What if I don’t make it?:</p>
<p>If I don’t reach my goal through indiegogo and individual fundraising then all the money I earn will be split between the charities of your choice. I am sponsoring four: The Red Cross, St. Jude Children Research Hospital, Susan G. Koeman for The Cure, and ASPCA. All you have to do is email me your choice and I will email you back with either pictures from my trip or the confirmation of your accepted donation.  </p>
<p>My history:</p>
<p>I have volunteered for KSPS answering phones to take donations for public access television.</p>
<p>I have created my own Red Cross cupcake drive, raising three hundred dollars.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Letter from me to you:</p>
<p>I understand times are tough.  Most people barely have enough money to keep their household afloat. I greatly appreciate the time you took out of your day to read this. I’d be thankful for any donation you can; whether that be ten cents or $100. If you can’t donate at all please tell your friends and family about my situation and maybe they will take it in their hearts to help me out. $8,000 is a lot of money to earn, but I know with your help and the power of social networking we can make this happen.</p>
<p>Thank you so much for your time.</p>

<h3>Nice to meet you...</h3>
<p>Hi, my name is Ana and I am extremely passionate about education and changing lives. I recently opened an early childhood program for ages 6 weeks - 5 years of age and am so thrilled to be taking on such a venture! I have been a teacher and administrator for over 10 years, primarly for ages K-12 and realized that there is such a need for early childhood programs that teach creativity, innovation and critical thinking skills for their future success.</p>
<p>This school wants to include a new technology and innovation lab where we can truly put STEM and change it into STREAM, integrating Reading and the Arts into action for the youngest of our students.</p>
<p>I am launching this campaign because so many of my family and friends have shared in my excitement and continue to ask how they can help build the program. The request has been overwhelming and I am blessed to have so many supporters.  Here is how you can help!!!</p>
<p>I would like to include a technology and innovation lab!</p>
<p>Your awesome donation will allow me to purchase the desktops and ipads needed for the technology lab and I am certain that the students will be thrilled to have these classes added to their day.</p>
<p>I invite you to explore the website at hawaiistreamacademy.org and learn more! </p>
</div>
<div><strong>Every Dollar Counts!!!<br/></strong></div>
<div>
<p>I need $35,000 for Mac Desktops, iPads, and Whiteboard Interactive Presentation Boards.</p>

March of this year , to try to persuade the people of Govan and 
surrounding communities that “Another Scotland is Possible”
 Govan holds  an iconic position in Scottish Politics the seat produced 
two stunning  by elections  that shook Scottish Politics to the core and
 furthered the cause of Independence  Margo Mc Donald’s victory in 1973 
and Jim Sillars in 1988 .We simply have to win in Govan in September
 
 Since starting Govan RIC has held a weekly stall at Govan X on Saturday
 mornings. Our members have participated in the Castlemilk Easterhouse 
and Drumchapel mass canvass and the subway leaflet drop on Mayday . From
 next week 7th May we will be starting Wednesday afternoon canvass 
sessions.<br/><br/>  We plan do more 

 Through local contacts with the Kinning Park Complex we have booked a 
public meeting for the 5 th of June. The cost of hiring the hall is £180
 and we envisage spending £100 on leaflets and posters advertising the 
meeting 
 The membership of Govan RIC is made up of retired people, students and 
people whose sole income is welfare benefits . We are struggling to 
raise the funds to pay for the hall
 We are well aware that we need more members are undertake some

Govan RIC</span><br/></p></div>","Govan RIC was set up in 
March of this year , to try to persuade the people of Govan and 
surrounding communities that “Another Scotland is Possible”
 Govan holds  an iconic position in Scottish Politics the seat produced 
two stunning  by elections  that shook Scottish Politics to the core and
 furthered the cause of Independence  Margo Mc Donald’s victory in 1973 
and Jim Sillars in 1988 .We simply have to win in Govan in September
 
 Since starting Govan RIC has held a weekly stall at Govan X on Saturday
 mornings. Our members have participated in the Castlemilk Easterhouse 
and Drumchapel mass canvass and the subway leaflet drop on Mayday . From
 next week 7th May we will be starting Wednesday afternoon canvass 
sessions.  We plan do more 

 Through local contacts with the Kinning Park Complex we have booked a 
public meeting for the 5 th of June. The cost of hiring the hall is £180
 and we envisage spending £100 on leaflets and posters advertising the 
meeting 
 The membership of Govan RIC is made up of retired people, students and 
people whose sole income is welfare benefits . We are struggling to 
raise the funds to pay for the hall
 We are well aware that we need more members are undertake some 
fund-raising ourselves .It is hoped  that the public meeting will bring 
us more members and a collection will help us purchase more campaign 
material to take the RIC agenda to the people of Govan and surrounding 
communities of Kinning Park Ibrox Cessnock Linthouse and Drumoyne 
 

 We are appealing to the wider Yes campaign to help fund our public 
meeting on the 5th June . On our part we will undertake to campaign

</div></div>","The History 

      The Two Medicine River Dinosaur Center is one of only two dinosaur research facilities in the State of Montana – an area richer and more diverse in its dinosaurs than  any other state.  However, for over 100 years, Montana’s dinosaur fossils have gone to museums around the world with few left in the State. Since 1995, the Two Medicine Dinosaur Center, a 501(c)3 nonprofit organization, has worked to not only better understand the past through its fossils and dinosaurs, but to also keep these remarkable fossils where they were discovered. The Two Medicine Dinosaur Center has also been responsible for paradigm shifts in understanding animal interactions and the prehistory of western North America.  
     The Two Medicine Dinosaur provides educational field experiences for all ages, as well as lending its expertise to other small facilities across Montana, which, in turn, helps establish more educational programs and furthers research. The research conducted by the Two Medicine Dinosaur Center has been at the heart of several new species reports and numerous reinterpretations of paleontology. Dave Trexler, the lead paleontologist at the Two Medicine Dinosaur Center, was the featured scientist in the Discovery Channel special, “Secrets of the Dinosaur Mummy.”   
     The Two Medicine Dinosaur Center began with zero assets and still today receives no tax dollars for its operational costs. Located in Bynum, Montana - a town with a population of less than 100 people - the Two Medicine Dinosaur Center is limited in its ability to gather local funding necessary to expand; however, due to its unique local geology, the area is excellent for research and field experience opportunities.
 Opportunity: ""The Learning Center"" 
     After 16 years of steady growth and pressing needs from the community and Montana itself, the Two Medicine Dinosaur Center has grown beyond its physical capacity. Currently, in order to conduct indoor educational programs, the facility must be closed to the public due to lack of space. Newly excavated plaster blocks of fossils must be stored in the exhibit area due to lack of space in the collections area. Community meetings are also held in the facility, crammed into the gift store area due to lack of other space. 
     Currently, the facility is entirely supported  through gift shop revenues, programs, memberships, and donations. Due to funding limitations,  growth occurs “a piece at a time” as income permits. It has only been the past few years that the facility has been able to hire part-time staff.
     This Fall, the organization received its first major grant – a Montana Tourism Infrastructure Investment Program (TIIP) grant. The grant will provide partial funding for the construction of the ""Learning Center,"" a second floor expansion which will provide a permanent area for guest speakers, research, and year-round educational programs for all ages. This addition will free up existing first floor space for additional exhibits of fossil and new archeological artifacts and a larger collections and laboratory area. This larger collections area will more adequately meet the federal requirements to house specimens collected on State and Federal lands.

     This new addition will also provide the Bynum community its only public meeting space.     This is an exciting time for the Two Medicine Dinosaur Center! This new endeavor will greatly increase the Two Medicine Dinosaur Center's ability  to provide multiple opportunities - from education, to research, to a stronger community. 
  


What We Need & What You Get
 
The TIIP grant provides $2 for every $1 raised. Concentrated fundraising efforts are underway to meet the minimum $25,000 match. The grant provides $50,000 towards our $110,000 project.
In order to match the grant and complete the project before our May 1 summer opening date, time is critical and your help is vital.
The Two Medicine Dinosaur Center is a recognized 501(c)3  charitable non-profit organization. Whatever you are willing and able to donate is not only greatly appreciated, but also is tax deductible. We also have incentives for your help - Check them out! 
Again, your help is vital to our ability to continue this research facility. Thanks so much for your interest and support!

<p>Yes! We are the Davis-Putter Scholarship Fund. We are a
national fund that supports activist students all over the U.S.</p>
<p>Over fifty years ago, veterans of the sit-in movement
boarded buses with hopes of desegregating the south - putting their lives on
the line and building an ever growing student movement.<span>  That same year the Davis-Putter Scholarship
Fund was created. </span></p>
<p>The Fund has provided $2.8 million in grants to over 900
students over the past five decades. </p>
<p>Our grantees have been at the forefront of virtually every major
progressive social movement.<span>  Student Non-Violent
Coordinating Committee activists, Vietnam War resisters, anti-imperialist
solidarity organizers, Puerto Rican independence leaders. They have been on the
frontlines working against the prison industrial complex, police abuse,
gentrification and militarization and for the rights of workers, women, LGBT
community and immigrants. Our community of grantees includes artists, scholars,
people's lawyers, political prisoners and organizers.</span></p>
<p>And the best part... the fund has supported radical student

Say what? ...There is an activist scholarship fund?
Yes! We are the Davis-Putter Scholarship Fund. We are a
national fund that supports activist students all over the U.S.
Over fifty years ago, veterans of the sit-in movement
boarded buses with hopes of desegregating the south - putting their lives on
the line and building an ever growing student movement.  That same year the Davis-Putter Scholarship
Fund was created. 
The Fund has provided $2.8 million in grants to over 900
students over the past five decades. 
Our grantees have been at the forefront of virtually every major
progressive social movement.  Student Non-Violent
Coordinating Committee activists, Vietnam War resisters, anti-imperialist
solidarity organizers, Puerto Rican independence leaders. They have been on the
frontlines working against the prison industrial complex, police abuse,
gentrification and militarization and for the rights of workers, women, LGBT
community and immigrants. Our community of grantees includes artists, scholars,
people's lawyers, political prisoners and organizers.
And the best part... the fund has supported radical student
activists with funds from our communities and our movements! There’s no
endowment, we are funded by many committed donors who have been supporting the
Fund over the years and we need you to join with them in supporting these
amazing activists!
What's our idea?
Our idea is to continue to support students who are taking
it to the streets and making change happen for years to come! Our grantees are
working to re-imagine broken systems and are organizing to end all forms of
oppression.

</p><p>Hello, my name is Michele Harvey. I am a writer as well as a volunteer
teammate for Humanity's Team, a top-rated nonprofit organization, and a global
grassroots spiritual movement with a mission to promote Global Oneness. </p>
<p>It is through my work with Humanity's Team that I met fellow Humanity's Team member, and my dear friend <b>Mukul

founder of Phulbari English Medium K.G School, </b>a school for young
children located in a rural village, in the poor country of
Bangladesh. Phulbari English Medium K.G School was founded in 1999, and is
in dire need of structural repairs and enhancements for the health, safety, and
well being of its 200 children. </p>
<p>Your donation will make it possible for these children to learn in a school
with classrooms separated by walls instead of mats, classrooms with adequate
lighting in lieu of darkness, and in a school that is properly insulated from
heavy rains and flooding. Your donation will make it possible for these children
to learn in a clean school with adequate plumbing and toilet
facilities. </p>
<p>Bangladesh has a low but climbing literacy rate. Your donation will help
make a difference in the lives of these children, their teachers, their
families, and the future.</p>
<p><strong>What We Need </strong></p>
<p>Phulbari English Medium K.G School needs $6500 in order to complete all
needed construction and structural repairs. This estimate was given to
Mukul Nandi by a structural engineer who toured the school and it includes both
materials and labor. <b>All donations will be wired by Indiegogo directly into
the Phulbari English Medium K.G School's bank account in Bangladesh.</b></p>
<p><b>The Phulbari English Medium K.G School's needed construction and
repairs are as follows:</b></p>
<p>A new roof, new floors, construction of two bathrooms, light fittings in
every classroom, an electric fan in every classroom, walls to separate the
classrooms, and the construction of an office space.  </p><p>
