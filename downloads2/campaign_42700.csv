Read More to Find Out How 
SightSaver Sunglasses

Are Vital ""Sunscreen For Your Eyes.""










HEV (High Energy Visible) rays are believed to be as damaging to your eyes as the better-known UVA and UVB rays. They’re everywhere, and their effect is cumulative over a lifetime. And due to atmospheric changes, they are getting worse.

HEV rays are known to cause cataracts and macular degeneration (AMD) – but this danger is no longer just age-related.


Children and younger adults are also increasingly susceptible to these harmful rays because of their addiction to digital devices with screens. Computers, tablets, smartphones, and gaming devices make the problem worse and increase the risk! 


Everyone’s eyes need protection from the effects of HEV rays.






Natural melanin is the protective pigment found in our skin – and it’s also in our eyes.
 In the eyes, it is found behind the retina and is there to protect it.
Unfortunately, 25% of this natural melanin is lost by age 50 – and considerable additional loss occurs by age 65. People with blue eyes  are particularly susceptible to melanin loss, and therefore are at even greater risk.





Yale Medical Research Center and Dr. John Pawelek pioneered the creation of synthetic melanin, which was initially used in cosmetics. Our proprietary, vision-specific version, Melaneye, is infused in the lenses of SightSaver Sunglasses. Melaneye has the same effect as melanin, to effectively compensate for the age-related loss of natural melanin in our eyes. It counteracts HEV rays by filtering them. 


Most sunglasses provide protection from harmful UVA and UVB rays, but this isn’t enough. Why would you settle for sunglasses that only do half the job? Only our Melaneye-infused lenses provide protection from 98% of the damaging HEV rays. The HEV rays are filtered, not blocked (like blue blockers), and that way natural color is maintained. 

 
“Wearing lenses with synthetic melanin is a natural means of protecting oneself – it makes up for the loss of retinal melanin that occurs with increasing age – as melanin is the very pigment that nature has chosen to protect us.”
–Jose-Alain Safel, French National Hospital Center for Ophthalmology
SightSaver Sunglasses with Melaneye-Infused Lenses in stylish TR90 Frames 

Natural melanin in the eyes improves contrast and definition. As we know, this natural melanin is lost with age – and it can also be compromised due to exposure to screens on modern digital devices. Our proprietary Melaneye restores lost contrast and definition – as well as protecting your eyes.


The HEV rays connect to scattered light and water vapor in the air and cause haze. This haze may or may not be discernible – but it’s there and reduces visual acuity. Melaneye lenses counteract that haze and produce greater visual acuity. You’ll see with better definition, and with greater detail and contrast. Images will be crisper and more distinct. And since our lenses are also polarized, they reduce glare as well. 


Outdoor sports and other activities are more fun when you can see more clearly. SightSaver Sunglasses, with their Melaneye-infused lenses, are particularly effective where there’s reflected light from water or snow. These surfaces can often double the damage of harmful HEV rays. Many of our favorite outdoor activities and sports take place in exactly these conditions – and we need to neutralize these intensified HEV rays and protect our eyes.

Important: Hear for yourself what two seasoned sports professionals – from the worlds of snow and water respectively – have to say about the performance of SightSaver Sunglasses.




 ""Everything will look much clearer. The people who wear them prefer them to anything else.  People who wear them on a regular basis claim to have much better vision.”            – Chris Ryser, DLO

National Sailing Champion Silverhawk (I-100) illustrates the challenges of boating in hazy, water-reflective sunlight conditions.
 
The SightSaver Sunglasses design is intentionally a curved, wraparound style of frame and lenses. This helps protect your peripheral vision – and keeps out as much unfiltered light as possible. But this wraparound style creates a problem for prescription lens wearers, because prescription lenses need a flatter surface to be effective. 

SightSaver Sunglasses solve this problem by placing a smaller removable frame inside the larger primary frame. 
By simply taking this smaller frame to a local optometrist, anyone can have personal prescription lenses placed in the smaller frame – and then easily attach them to the inside of the larger frame. This inner frame is included with your pair of SightSavers at no additional cost. When you have your SightSavers with you, you can leave your prescription glasses home – we’ve got you covered!




The small “tongues” on the nose bridge and the insides of the frame fit into the grooves on the larger frame. The smaller frame is easily removed if you don’t need it.
 

SightSaver Sunglasses give you the best of both worlds. If you need prescription lenses, our sunglasses have a unique way of providing them while preserving the functional and attractive wraparound style of frame. If you don’t need a prescription, you simply don’t use the smaller, removable inside frame.



There’s a lot more to the performance of SightSaver Sunglasses.
See and hear for yourself what others – just like you – have to say about SightSaver Sunglasses.






Melaneye protects against damaging and harmful HEV rays.
Melaneye retards and compensates for natural melanin loss caused by HEV rays.
Melaneye addresses the issue of melanin loss from overexposure to digital devices with screens (computer screens, tablets, smartphones, gaming devices, etc.).
Enhanced visual acuity provides better contrast and definition, leading to better performance and greater enjoyment of outdoor sports and activities.
Prescription lens capability – while preserving melanin benefits and the enhanced protection of a wraparound style design.


Note the high-quality wraparound frame for greater protected vision – including peripheral vision.


High-quality polycarbonate lenses.
Anti-reflective coating – on both sides.
Super anti-scratch coating – on both sides.
Our proprietary synthetic melanin – Melaneye – is infused into the lenses.
Polarized lenses reduce glare.
Open frame provides better, unhindered vision.
Wraparound frame style reduces unfiltered light.
Frame color is a stylish gun-metal gray.
SightSaver Sunglasses also have 100% UVA and UVB protection.
Frames are made from TR90, a superior material used for many high-end, brand-name, designer sunglasses costing $200-$300 or more.
Successfully passed an Impact Resistance test and Penetration Resistance test to ANSI Z87.1-2003 standard.
Smaller, removable inner frame accommodates prescription lenses.  There is no additional cost for this frame and capability.
Microfiber bag holds your eyewear and can double as a cleaning cloth.

Handsome eyewear case included, with the SightSaver Sunglasses logo. 

After personally experiencing cataract surgery, I KNOW the importance of protecting my eyes from further vision deterioration. My research and development have led me to the creation of SightSaver Sunglasses with Melaneye.
And this is not just for those with age-related vision challenges – but also for many in the younger generations who interact daily with digital devices with screens that threaten the natural melanin in their eyes. Let’s face it. Our precious eyes are critically important to us – regardless of age!


The money raised from this Indiegogo Campaign will be used to pay product development expenses, fine-tune the product, and of course provide the perks to those of you who support us. And it will provide initial funds to take the product to the next level where it can be made available to a larger audience who can also benefit from better eyesight protection.


I’ve been in the crowdfunding trenches before with two successful campaigns – one of them being a category record-breaker. I know what it takes to make this work – and I will do my part to make this a WIN-WIN experience for everyone.

 


As a ""perk"" for your support, you can acquire one or more pairs of these SightSaver Sunglasses for a price well below MSRP that will never be lower or repeated anywhere else. When these superior sunglasses become commercially available, their price will be higher – as is appropriate for quality innovative eyewear.
You will be among the first to own these extraordinary “Best in Class” Melaneye-infused sunglasses. When people hear about how special they are, and see how great they look, they will ask, “WHERE did you get these? HOW can I get a pair?” (Here’s a tip. Be careful about lending them out. You may have trouble getting them back!)
Look to the right on this page and see the levels of perks we’re offering. One of these will be right for you. If you’re new to Indiegogo, pledging to our campaign is simple. Just choose the number of pairs of SightSaver Sunglasses you wish to order (multiples earn you a discount) – click on it – and proceed to checkout.

So, I’ll make this easy for you and give you your very own “Round Tuit” – and then you won’t have any excuse for not being among the first to own these important eye-protecting sunglasses.





It doesn’t matter what your age may be. Improved eye protection from the sun’s FULL spectrum of damaging rays can help ANYONE. It can be the margin of safety you need and deserve. You can have that peace of mind with your very own SightSaver Sunglasses. 


Choose your perk from the choices to the right and be among the first to experience the full BENEFITS of this unique and innovative approach to better-protected vision. Reserve your SightSaver Sunglasses NOW – and then spread the word to help make sure this Indiegogo Campaign succeeds.

I have been using filters through all my work.

VIKKIN MatteBox is the worlds lightest Super-Wide lens compatible and most compact Clip-On Matte Box system for photographers and videographers with possibility to rotate 4x4 inch filters.


VIKKIN MatteBox has two sets of flags. Larger set is for the best prevention of glare and lens flare. Larger flags can eliminate flare on lenses up to 16mm wide. B82 MatteBox weighs only 400g with 3 flags or 250g with a small flag. B82 comes bundled with worlds best Firecrest polarizer filter and has 2 or more slots for 4x4 inch resin or glass filters. With Full Frame camera and 16mm lenses - NO vignetting! 


IF You need (and you will!) a filter holder what is light and still has all professional features, then VIKKIN B82 can help You make Your own unique visuals, videos or pictures. VIKKIN B82 MatteBox is designed for all that! Smaller flags still perform well in blocking out the sun or even backlight, but reduce the weight and size of the rig, making handling easier and enabling use of Gimbals and Steadicams.

About VIKKIN MatteBox Hello!My name is Viktor Koshkin  I have been working as a photographer and a cinematographer in Estonia for 20 years. I have been using filters through all my work. Some things are impossible or way too cumbersome to do in postproduction, so I prefer to get my images to look just the way I want them with only minor tweaks in post-production. I also developed a need for a portable Matte Box. The existing Matte Boxes were too heavy and cumbersome for filming handheld cameras and DSLR-s. Also, I wasn't able to use my 4x4"" filters on wide angle lenses. So I decided to develop my own Matte Box system.

VIKKIN is the brand name, which I have created especially for that. It took me 3 Years to finally get the product ready in it's final form. Now it is finally ready: the VIKKIN B82 MatteBox. It is the MatteBox what satisfies all my needs. I can use not only ND and CPL filters, but also MIST, SOFT and any other I desire. I believe that my MatteBox can prove to be useful to many other likeminded photographers and cinematographers. I think that it will make our work simpler and more satisfying.  I have currently made 8 sets of B82 MatteBox systems. In order to make a first commercial run, I have decided to turn to Indiegogo for help. I need to raise 35 000 EUR to manufacture and deliver 50 sets of VIKKIN MatteBox systems.If You would like to buy this product, or would just like to help me get this project off the ground, then  please check out the Perks and support this project!Only the sky is the limit!Yours sincerelyViktor Koshkin

Using VIKKIN MatteBoxVIKKIN MatteBox has already been tested and approved by several other photographers and cinematographers. Here's a video of B82 MatteBox in the hands of professional videographer and DOP - Christian Johannes Kask""Vikkin mattebox has everything you can ask for - durable, lightweight and is compatible with wide angle lenses. It is essential for light camera setups - handheld, steadicam and camera stabilizers like Glidecam, Ronin, MoVI where weight is limited. ""

Technical Parameters







The weight of the B82 together with the sun shading flags is just 400g with 3 flags or 250g with a small flag.

Larger flag set is for the best prevention of glare and lens flare. Smaller flags still perform well in blocking out the sun or other light source, but reduce the weight and size of the rig, improving handling and enabling easy use of Gimbals and Steadicams.
With the two 4x4"" front mounted filters there is no vignetting even at an super-wide focal length of 16 mm on a Full Frame camera (competing products support wide angles only up to 20 mm).

VIKKIN B82 MatteBox is manufactured from hight quality materials. B82 flags are manufactured from strong 7075 T6 grade, anodized, aluminum, what ensures their rigidity. Frame is made using 6000 grade,anodized, aluminum. Small plastic parts are 3D printed using strong Polyamide plastic.


B82 is directly mountable on a lens with Cokin Adapter Rings.

VIKKIN B82 MatteBox is compatible with 4x4'' filters 

B82 is also equipped with a mount for a camera support system (15mm rods), which has a sliding function


The B82 flags are coated with an anti reflective flocking ( an option only available on a few high-end products).


The product will be sold together with a special polarizer filter made of Superwhite filter glass manufactured by Schott. The Polarizer is made by Formatt-Hitech and designed for the B82 by VIKKIN. 


B82 MatteBox is also compatible with standard screw-in 82mm Ultra-Slim Circular Polarizers. They will not provide performance on par with the designated Formatt-Hittech filter, but can be used with no vignette on lenses up to 24mm and do not interfer with 4x4'' filters. 


B82 is meant for lenses with a diameter of up to 82 mm


I personally check and adjust every part in my MatteBox system to ensure high fit and quality. 


VIKKIN MatteBox is made by strong hands of Estonian men! 







Manufacturing process, budget and progress so far
Prices are dependent on the order quantity, so in order to be able to sell this product at the current prices, I need to order parts for 50 sets.  
This campaign has a flexible budget. I have currently built 8 sets of VIKKIN B82 MatteBox. And guarantee that even with incomplete funding I will be able to deliver this product to Every backer. I won't be making any profit in this case, but at least excited backers won't have to be disappointed. Other perks are also simple to make and will be going out as scheduled.  
Our partners are ready to manufacture the necessary parts and I plan to ship all the Perks and orders in 3 months after the end of the campaign. Expect to receive Your VIKKIN MatteBox in November 2015! Early Bird supporters will have their order shipped within a week after their contribution. NB Quantity is limited! Smaller Perks will be shipped within 1 month after the end of the campaign. 
As for the future plans - this project is scalable. My company and manufacturing partners are ready to produce up to 100 sets of B82 MatteBox systems monthly, in case the Indiegogo campaign proves to be successful. I am looking forward to getting my products out to the sets.

</div>My name is Chauncey Dozier, owner and creative director of Mustache Pete Clothing.<br/><br/>All though most people consider me a designer, I see myself as a visionary. After pulling myself through some rough times, I set my sights on creating innovative, artistic clothing, and haven't looked back. While working in management and marketing at the Wagon Boutique in Brooklyn, I  discovered my hidden talent for fashion design. I also learned to ""style"" some music artists which led me to managing them, and led me to now be on the marketing team for UMMGI (Universal Management Marketing Group).<br/><br/>In 2011 my passion for design led me to create my own line. I wanted a new fresh look marked by a special logo, with a business that would make my customers feel taken care of and deliver to them really unique, artistic styles.<br/><br/>When I first started Mustache Pete Clothing, I had special packaging created for my clothes and  accessories. My customers loved it and knew they were getting their money's worth. The packaging not only protected their apparel, but such crafty packaging made customers feel appreciated and kept Mustache Pete's brand in their mind<br/><br/>After some searching, I finally come across MATADOG DESIGNS a company based in Greece to help make my vision  of packaging and production a reality. Most companies in New York City had minimum order requirements I couldn't reach. MATADOG worked with my little to no budget, but their location and shipping time and costs became prohibitive as I needed to expand and create more for my customers.<br/><br/>I started this campaign (Versa Printer/Cutter for Mustache Pete Clothing) in hopes to raise funds to purchase  the ROLAND VERSASTUDIO BN-20 PRINTER/CUTTER.  This great machine will enable me, right in my own studio, to take production of the unique look, premium packaging, tags, gifts, and services my customers love and deserve to new heights.  Over the years I've learned the importance of a satisfied customer. It's what keeps me and many businesses in business and makes what I create meaningful. I appreciate every customer or potential customer I encounter.<br/><br/>The Versa Printer will allow me create more innovative and customized designs and deliver them to my customers in a more time efficient and cost effective way.  This is the first step towards self-sufficiency in producing our own customized in-house line. With your donations we can purchase the Versa and create the unique packaging and other custom items for Mustache Pete and other similar small companies who are in the same position.<br/><br/>TIME IS URGENT as my latest line of clothing is in immediate need of in-house custom production and  exclusive packaging.  Mustache Pete Clothing has teamed up with <a href=""http://www.lucid.gs"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">LUCID</a> to create an inspiring collection for Basketball's  All Star Weekend 2015, with plans to continue to create designs for a new sport each year. We've worked hard and are proud of our Mustache Pete All Star Collection. With the All Star Weekend 2015 upon us, we need to more efficiently produce and deliver orders now and throughout 2015 to our customers. This campaign and the launch of this new line  is so important to us.<br/><br/>We need almost $9000 dollars to purchase this printer. Hoping to acquiring the funds in a few days may seem unrealistic, but we don't believe so. That's why we're here on Indigogo because we believe this is where campaigns are successful and dreams are made real.<br/><br/>If we raise more than our goal we will invest in even more powerful machines that will allow us to produce nearly everything we sell in house, and give us the opportunity to expand to greater and more diverse ventures.<br/><br/>Fashion and apparel is a risky business that requires constant investing. Seasons change and so do trends. So when and if inventory doesn't move as projected, were stuck with inventory and loose funds to produce for seasons to come. This machine will allow us to creatively customize our lines in house and fulfill on orders ourselves as they arrive, reducing the need for risky high volume, high-cost, pre-order outside production.<br/><br/>Your donations mean so much to us. If you can't donate, remember sharing is caring. Spread the word. Share our story. Help us to deliver our creative, artistic and unique vision<br/><br/>Your donations small large or any type of contribution will help and gladly be appreciated.<br/><br/>Kindest regards<p></p></div>","My name is Chauncey Dozier, owner and creative director of Mustache Pete Clothing.All though most people consider me a designer, I see myself as a visionary.

I also learned to ""style"" some music artists which led me to managing them, and led me to now be on the marketing team for UMMGI (Universal Management Marketing Group).In 2011 my passion for design led me to create my own line. I wanted a new fresh look marked by a special logo, with a business that would make my customers feel taken care of and deliver to them really unique, artistic styles.When I first started Mustache Pete Clothing, I had special packaging created for my clothes and  accessories. My customers loved it and knew they were getting their money's worth. The packaging not only protected their apparel, but such crafty packaging made customers feel appreciated and kept Mustache Pete's brand in their mindAfter some searching, I finally come across MATADOG DESIGNS a company based in Greece to help make my vision  of packaging and production a reality. Most companies in New York City had minimum order requirements I couldn't reach. MATADOG worked with my little to no budget, but their location and shipping time and costs became prohibitive as I needed to expand and create more for my customers.I started this campaign (Versa Printer/Cutter for Mustache Pete Clothing) in hopes to raise funds to purchase  the ROLAND VERSASTUDIO BN-20 PRINTER/CUTTER.  This great machine will enable me, right in my own studio, to take production of the unique look, premium packaging, tags, gifts, and services my customers love and deserve to new heights.  Over the years I've learned the importance of a satisfied customer. It's what keeps me and many businesses in business and makes what I create meaningful. I appreciate every customer or potential customer I encounter.The Versa Printer will allow me create more innovative and customized designs and deliver them to my customers in a more time efficient and cost effective way.  This is the first step towards self-sufficiency in producing our own customized in-house line. With your donations we can purchase the Versa and create the unique packaging and other custom items for Mustache Pete and other similar small companies who are in the same position.TIME IS URGENT as my latest line of clothing is in immediate need of in-house custom production and  exclusive packaging.  Mustache Pete Clothing has teamed up with LUCID to create an inspiring collection for Basketball's  All Star Weekend 2015, with plans to continue to create designs for a new sport each year. We've worked hard and are proud of our Mustache Pete All Star Collection. With the All Star Weekend 2015 upon us, we need to more efficiently produce and deliver orders now and throughout 2015 to our customers. This campaign and the launch of this new line  is so important to us.We need almost $9000 dollars to purchase this printer. Hoping to acquiring the funds in a few days may seem unrealistic, but we don't believe so. That's why we're here on Indigogo because we believe this is where campaigns are successful and dreams are made real.If we raise more than our goal we will invest in even more powerful machines that will allow us to produce nearly everything we sell in house, and give us the opportunity to expand to greater and more diverse ventures.Fashion and apparel is a risky business that requires constant investing. Seasons change and so do trends. So when and if inventory doesn't move as projected, were stuck with inventory and loose funds to produce for seasons to come. This machine will allow us to creatively customize our lines in house and fulfill on orders ourselves as they arrive, reducing the need for risky high volume, high-cost, pre-order outside production.Your donations mean so much to us. If you can't donate, remember sharing is caring. Spread the word. Share our story. Help us to deliver our creative, artistic and unique visionYour donations small large or any type of contribution will help and gladly be appreciated.Kindest regards",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<br/><p>The Volvorii Smart Shoe is Independent 3rd Party <a href=""http://www.dragoninnovation.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Dragon Innovation Certified</a>.</p>
<p>In essence it is smart high heel shoe whose colors and design patterns can be controlled via a smartphone app to match outfits, among its other hidden <i>sensorific</i> capabilities to be unlocked.</p>
<p>To be Dragon Innovation Certified the Volvorii functional prototype was put through a battery of tests and physical examinations by the engineers and analysts at Dragon Innovation in Boston, MA, USA to make sure it works. For a glimpse of what those extensive tests entailed please see the official Volvorii Dragon Innovation Certificate here: </p>
<p><a rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><a href=""https://www.dragoninnovation.com/certificates/48-volvorii-by-ishuu-technologies"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.dragoninnovation.com/certificates/48-volvorii-by-ishuu-technologies </a></p>

<br/><p>This did not happen overnight. For the past several months we've been working with Dragon Innovation through the certification process since they specialize in successfully bringing hardware products to market. Some of their customers include <b>Pebble, Coin, FormLabs, Makerbot, LIFX, Sifteo, MOD-t</b>, etc. So you may have seen their name on other crowdfunding campaigns.  Thus our quality of work is in the same league and had to pass the exact same high standards as the other successfully delivered crowdfunded projects listed above. </p>
<p>We understood that we are not a well known global brand with bottomless R&amp;D pockets that one would typically expect to pull off this kind of bleeding edge work. Nor are we based in Silicon Valley. So we had to put the Volvorii functional prototypes through even more rigorous tests than others. Mostly because the Volvorii was designed to compete for the <a href=""http://www.lvmhprize.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Louis Vuitton Prize</a>.</p>

<div>We started from scratch, designed then built something many considered impossible up until we gave them live hands-on demos of our <a rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><a href=""http://displayweek.org/2014/Program/I-Zone.aspx"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Innovation Award Nominated</a> fully functional prototypes. Our goal all along was to bring this futuristic experience into the everyday life in a seamless way that brings out the <i>fashionista</i> and <i>artista</i> in all. The added advantage of easy customization to carter for each individual’s own tastes and occasion was paramount.<p></p>
<p>We deliberately did not overwhelm the Volvorii with mountains of tech. Instead we focused on just the essence of what we thought truly matters to enduring style and fashion in our fast changing world. </p>
<p>Now we need your support to reach the next level we cannot on our own without your help. The money we raise during our pre-orders campaign will allow us to pay for the FCC &amp; CE testing, tooling &amp; mass manufacturing, refining the iOS and Android App, roll out an efficient online platform for users to purchase and sell smart shoe design patterns and accessories.</p>
<p>In a way we just might be on the verge of creating a new micro industry for the world, but it is clear we cannot do it alone. Even simply spreading the word will be of tremendous help to making this a reality.</p>

<h3>Detailed Time Line To Delivery <br/>
</h3>
<div><br/></div>
<p></p>
<p>July 2009 – Idea takes form, but Wallen is still in grad school studying Display Technologies. Fashion Wearables’ potential still haven’t quite fully sunk into the mass consciousness. Result? Adviser is not impressed. Idea gets shelved. </p>
<p>January 2013- Arduino tinkering on the smart shoe begins</p>
<p>July 2013-Roadkill prototype version successfully tested and it performs with curated, though embarrassing, video to prove it.</p>
<p>November 2013- Iterated prototype. Results are much better and video recorded for proof. Less embarrassing so video clip is shared with friends to get much needed feedback. Personal trusted adviser and friend Dr. Pedzi, MIT views clip and verdict is “Idea has legs”</p>
<p>November 2013 – Met Dan Tian at Beijing Maker Space. The combined hands on expertise prove now it was time. Industrial grade prototype development begins in earnest. The rest of team slowly begin to fall into place.<br/></p>
<p>January 2014 – Display driver control and Bluetooth LE electronic circuits merging and miniaturization to fit inside the sole of the shoe.</p>
<p>July 2014- Commercial grade prototype with custom miniaturized display driver control, BLE, battery wireless charging system.</p>
<p>September 2014 – Commercial grade prototype testing and refining for footwear mechanics.</p>
<p>January 2015 – Fully functional prototype becomes Dragon Innovation Certified</p>
<p>February 2015 – Crowdfunding preparation and continue refinements</p>
<p>March 2015 – Indiegogo crowdfunding campaign launches</p>
<p>April 2015 – Final product design and engineering refinements</p>
<p>April 2015 – Mass manufacturing validation tests</p>
<p>May 2015 – Volvorii goes into production</p>
<p>June 2015 – First batch of mass produced version of Volvorii undergoes extensive quality control.</p>
<p>December 2015 – Volvorii starts shipping</p>
<p></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>While we have done all the home work and due diligence we possibly could, in advance, to make sure the engineering designs and mass manufacturing plans are sound we still understand that there are still risks. Some risks we can imagine and try to prepare for in advance while others we cannot foresee.</p>
<p>There are risks that our factories might need more time to manufacture, for that we have put a few contingencies in place.</p>
<p>There are risks that while we still refine the Volvorii, it might take longer to fix the Android App bugs we currently have.  For this we plan to also use some of the campaign funds to hire more software developers to make sure everything will work perfectly within our delivery time frame.</p>
<p>There are risks that we or the engineers and analysts at Dragon Innovation might not have foreseen despite having put our best foot forward during the six point check. </p>
<p>In essence what we would like to convey to our backers is that : While we have done all that we could think of to anticipate even natural disasters so as to make the execution of this project as sound as it could be, there are still risks. This is because there are always  challenges when manufacturing physical
products as we go through the FCC &amp; CE certification processes, finish setting up the
production lines as well as lining up the logistics to get the Volvorii safely in your hands. </p>
<p></p>
<p>If any unexpected issue does come up, we have resolved to dig in and do everything in order to make sure we will be as
close to our target delivery time frame as possible. And more importantly that we will deliver to you a high quality product.</p>

We appreciate all your various forms of support, and we are very excited to have
you join us in this mission to usher in a new era of wearable displays. <br/>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px;"">“Using
current definitions the Volvorii is a wearable mobile display, another
variation of Google Glass that just takes a different form factor. With well
designed wearable displays the potential for an unknown talent to create a viral
and epic design that can be a world wallpaper in a matter of days is huge. Thus
there is potential to upset the balance. Just as the MP3 did to the music
industry, wearable displays such  as these are poised to do the same to the fashion industry.
Soon after the Spotifies of the fashion world will rise to take their own places, it’s
inevitable. And it’s not all bad.”</span></p>

The Volvorii Smart Shoe is Independent 3rd Party Dragon Innovation Certified.
In essence it is smart high heel shoe whose colors and design patterns can be controlled via a smartphone app to match outfits, among its other hidden sensorific capabilities to be unlocked.
To be Dragon Innovation Certified the Volvorii functional prototype was put through a battery of tests and physical examinations by the engineers and analysts at Dragon Innovation in Boston, MA, USA to make sure it works. For a glimpse of what those extensive tests entailed please see the official Volvorii Dragon Innovation Certificate here: 
https://www.dragoninnovation.com/certificates/48-volvorii-by-ishuu-technologies 

                                     
This did not happen overnight. For the past several months we've been working with Dragon Innovation through the certification process since they specialize in successfully bringing hardware products to market. Some of their customers include Pebble, Coin, FormLabs, Makerbot, LIFX, Sifteo, MOD-t, etc. So you may have seen their name on other crowdfunding campaigns.  Thus our quality of work is in the same league and had to pass the exact same high standards as the other successfully delivered crowdfunded projects listed above. 
We understood that we are not a well known global brand with bottomless R&D pockets that one would typically expect to pull off this kind of bleeding edge work. Nor are we based in Silicon Valley. So we had to put the Volvorii functional prototypes through even more rigorous tests than others. Mostly because the Volvorii was designed to compete for the Louis Vuitton Prize.

               Step into the future today with the Int'l Award Nominated Volvorii.
The Volvorii is streamlined, has an embedded flexible electronic paper display, a Bluetooth LE module with battery wireless charging, elegantly positioned fastener accessory anchors both on the front and back of the shoe.  
                           Style, comfort and convenience are at its epicenter.









The Volvorii’s clean, elegant, sturdy design brings gravitas, respect and formality in an unmistakable way. Whether you are a CEO at the apex of your industry or a prospective intern who got it as a graduation present going for your first interview in the corporate world, the Volvorii will carry you with grace.




                                Yes ladies, you can have your cake and eat it too! 

You love the way your completely white Volvorii perfectly completed your work ensemble today but of course you can't wear the same outfit tomorrow. What's a girl to do ? No problem. Click the smartphone app button to change the shoes' flexible display and instantly change your completely white Volvorii to white with a dash of dark. The devil does not wear that shoe anymore, she now wears something with real 21st Century magic in it.




Going on a special date and want that more fashionable look. Simply click your smartphone app to change what is displayed on the flexible screen to show design patterns with a flare.












With the front fastener anchor you can customize your unique look by attaching detachable accessories to your smart shoe to match that ""oh so impossible but unique"" outfit that you love so much! 
We plan to set up an online platform for users to buy a variety of accessories or request for those they want. While interested designers can make show stopping accessories for the Volvorii and list them on the platform. 





With the front and back fastener anchors you can customize your unique total ensemble look to your heart’s content. You want diamond studs fasteners to bling your Volvoriis? Or your initials on a plate? Or golden chain with sparkles for the party? Or jewelry gems for the ultimate glamor Volvorii runway look? …Your imagination is the limit.





With the back fastener anchors you can attach a variety of detachable ankle straps that not only add a touch of more design elegance but also provide that added comfort advantage. Just the thing for when walking in your heels for long is called for. 



Then you are in luck!
No more guessing what is the right holidays gift for that special woman in your life.
Because :
a) A holidays gift she can customize in unlimited ways to fit her very unique personality/mood/atmosphere/etc or all those other reasons that even super computers have not yet figured out, let alone you, is a gift you can't go wrong with.
b) Simply put, here is a gift she will rave about and more importantly the guy who got it for her. And you know what that does to the Brownie Points Bank!
c) If feeling like totally impressing, the whole nine yards? Then pre-order the Developers Kit Perk, bond as you build a whole line of Smart Shoes together while making future plans. 




The Volvorii smart shoe concept, to a notable extent, was inspired by the work at MIT’s Smart Customization Research Group < http://scg.mit.edu/ >. However, we are not in any way affiliated with the university or the Smart Customization Research Group.
But we applied our own take on the similar theories and also read some of the best written words on the subject of smart customization including the following titles: 
1-Infinite Possibility: Creating Customer Value on the Digital Frontier 
2-Handbook of Research in Mass Customization and Personalization














In the Volvorii smart shoe we hope to bring you a shoe that has unprecedented levels of being simultaneously versatile and elegant. It is our true hope that from this work and with your support the future of smart fashion has just crossed a threshold. And you got to cross it first.

The comparison table below shows how the Volvorii stacks up against other well known customizable shoes. The goal is not to disparage anyone but merely to illustrate the value proposition we will provide to you our valuable backers.




We started from scratch, designed then built something many considered impossible up until we gave them live hands-on demos of our Innovation Award Nominated fully functional prototypes. Our goal all along was to bring this futuristic experience into the everyday life in a seamless way that brings out the fashionista and artista in all. The added advantage of easy customization to carter for each individual’s own tastes and occasion was paramount.
We deliberately did not overwhelm the Volvorii with mountains of tech. Instead we focused on just the essence of what we thought truly matters to enduring style and fashion in our fast changing world. 
Now we need your support to reach the next level we cannot on our own without your help. The money we raise during our pre-orders campaign will allow us to pay for the FCC & CE testing, tooling & mass manufacturing, refining the iOS and Android App, roll out an efficient online platform for users to purchase and sell smart shoe design patterns and accessories.
In a way we just might be on the verge of creating a new micro industry for the world, but it is clear we cannot do it alone. Even simply spreading the word will be of tremendous help to making this a reality.






After your purchase, make sure you share your unique referral link with your friends and family. If 5 of your referrals purchase through your unique referral link, you get your Volvorii for free!  
You will find your referral link upon completing your purchase. For any questions about the referral program please email jane@ishuu.com.






THE SEASONED CORE TEAM 


 Wallen Mphepö | CEO  
Wallen’s professional and academic background in Electronic Information Display technologies is covered in a dizzying array of ground breaking display technologies that have been featured in everything from The Wall Street Journal, to The Economist, to TechCrunch, to The New Scientist, to Popular Science, to IEEE/OSA Magazines & Journals and everything in between. He is also a reviewer for several IEEE and Optical Society of America’s Scientific and Technology Journals that touch on all facets of advanced & novel electronic information display technologies. For a peek at a sample of some of his work please  see:    http://about.me/wallen 



 Mark Willner – UC Berkeley, MBA |  Post-Financing COO 
Having founded and ran several Technology companies in the past, Mark brings a real seasoned veteran's insight into how to run a multifaceted tech and fashion project such as ours. With the ability to see the grand vision and the know-how to have it executed on the day to day, his expertise holds the key to making the project delivery a success.


 George Melnik – Kent State Univ, PhD | Post-Financing CTO
For the ground breaking technology platforms that have an electronic information display dimension to not just work but sing in synchrony, a steady hand at the tech helm is necessary. George is a rare find for our team. He is the kind of technology expert who brings in vast experience in CTO, R&D, Tech Advisory positions he has held in the past to bear on the project. 


 Dan Tian | Bluetooth SW/HW Expert & Founder of JUMA  To say Dan is a Bluetooth expert might be a gross understatement. This unassuming guy, for a long while, was the only Chinese member on the international Bluetooth technology standards and direction steering committee. He has been working hands on with Bluetooth since 1999. He is deeply involved in the whole Bluetooth industry, including chipsets, standards, stack, software, embedded and system applications. JUMA offers Complete Bluetooth Smart Development framework, High Quality Bluetooth Manufacturing Supply Chain and Expert Bluetooth Smart consulting solutions for efficient product delivery. 


Jusheng Ren | Hardware Extraordinaire 
When it absolutely has to be customized, miniaturized, fine tuned and soldered by hand - all in record time and still come out looking and working like it got the advanced robotic accuracy treatment, Jusheng is your man. Juice as we prefer to refer him as, is the guy behind the complete transformation of the three storey building of electronics boards in our very first prototype to a coin sized board that packs everything including Bluetooth smart, wireless battery charging and a completely new Display Driver Controller circuit that he built from scratch. If that is not an art form then we don’t know what is. 



Jane Yang | Marketing & Shoe Critic With a Masters Degree from Belgium in EU-China Business plus hands on experience working for a Dutch Business Development Consulting Firm, Jane knows how to transcend boundaries and get the message across. As a perennial high heel wearer herself, she insisted on making sure the Volvorii is something she would enjoy wearing everyday herself. 



Josh Fairbain, Morpho MFG | Shoe Manufacturing Partner 

Josh Fairbain and his company Morpho MFG have been helping hardware makers for years. They are probably one of the most unsung heroes behind the scenes. They have made some of the most iconic and successful hardware crowdfunding projects not only get delivered, but delivered on time. We are glad to have them as our partner in this endeavor to bring about one of the most beautiful wearable fashion products we hope to share with the world. http://morphomfg.com/

Detailed Time Line To Delivery 



July 2009 – Idea takes form, but Wallen is still in grad school studying Display Technologies. Fashion Wearables’ potential still haven’t quite fully sunk into the mass consciousness. Result? Adviser is not impressed. Idea gets shelved. 
January 2013- Arduino tinkering on the smart shoe begins
July 2013-Roadkill prototype version successfully tested and it performs with curated, though embarrassing, video to prove it.
November 2013- Iterated prototype. Results are much better and video recorded for proof. Less embarrassing so video clip is shared with friends to get much needed feedback. Personal trusted adviser and friend Dr. Pedzi, MIT views clip and verdict is “Idea has legs”
November 2013 – Met Dan Tian at Beijing Maker Space. The combined hands on expertise prove now it was time. Industrial grade prototype development begins in earnest. The rest of team slowly begin to fall into place.
January 2014 – Display driver control and Bluetooth LE electronic circuits merging and miniaturization to fit inside the sole of the shoe.
July 2014- Commercial grade prototype with custom miniaturized display driver control, BLE, battery wireless charging system.
September 2014 – Commercial grade prototype testing and refining for footwear mechanics.
January 2015 – Fully functional prototype becomes Dragon Innovation Certified
February 2015 – Crowdfunding preparation and continue refinements
March 2015 – Indiegogo crowdfunding campaign launches
April 2015 – Final product design and engineering refinements
April 2015 – Mass manufacturing validation tests
May 2015 – Volvorii goes into production
June 2015 – First batch of mass produced version of Volvorii undergoes extensive quality control.
December 2015 – Volvorii starts shipping



Risks & Challenges
While we have done all the home work and due diligence we possibly could, in advance, to make sure the engineering designs and mass manufacturing plans are sound we still understand that there are still risks. Some risks we can imagine and try to prepare for in advance while others we cannot foresee.
There are risks that our factories might need more time to manufacture, for that we have put a few contingencies in place.
There are risks that while we still refine the Volvorii, it might take longer to fix the Android App bugs we currently have.  For this we plan to also use some of the campaign funds to hire more software developers to make sure everything will work perfectly within our delivery time frame.
There are risks that we or the engineers and analysts at Dragon Innovation might not have foreseen despite having put our best foot forward during the six point check. 
In essence what we would like to convey to our backers is that : While we have done all that we could think of to anticipate even natural disasters so as to make the execution of this project as sound as it could be, there are still risks. This is because there are always  challenges when manufacturing physical
products as we go through the FCC & CE certification processes, finish setting up the
production lines as well as lining up the logistics to get the Volvorii safely in your hands. 

If any unexpected issue does come up, we have resolved to dig in and do everything in order to make sure we will be as
close to our target delivery time frame as possible. And more importantly that we will deliver to you a high quality product.

We appreciate all your various forms of support, and we are very excited to have
you join us in this mission to usher in a new era of wearable displays.

  pay VAT?


You are making
  a contribution and receiving the Volvorii as a gift and should not have to
  pay VAT. However, depending on your country you may or may not have to pay
  your country's own customs fees or other fees. So please do check with your country’s
  customs and regulations in advance before submitting contributions.




Can I split a
  bulk order into multiple shipments?


Our system
  currently does not support shipping to multiple addresses. Please make a
  second contribution if you would like to ship to multiple addresses. For all
  questions regarding bulk orders, please email jane@ishuu.com and use
  ""BULK ORDER INQUIRY"" as the subject line. Or consider our Family
  Pack , Distributor Pack or Brand Pack Perks as alternative options.





PART IV 






SUPPORT




How do I
  choose more than one perk?


The Indiegogo
  system is not set up to choose multiple perks. If you would like to choose
  more than one perk, you will need to initiate a separate process for each
  pre-order. If you encounter difficulties, please email jane@ishuu.com and use
  ""NEED HELP WITH ORDERING"" as the subject line.




Bulk Orders:
  how can I order a larger number of units?


For all
  questions regarding bulk orders, please email jane@ishuu.com and use
  ""BULK ORDER INQUIRY"" as the subject line. Or consider our Family
  Pack , Distributor Pack or Brand Pack Perks as alternative options.




I preordered
  Volvorii but I didn't get a confirmation email. How can I check the status?


Please refer
  to this article on How to Know if Your Contribution is Successful. If there
  is still an issue, then you may need to contact support@indiegogo.com.




There was an
  error with my contribution. What happened?


Please refer
  to this article on common contribution errors and steps to resolve: Common Contribution Errors.




Why am I
  checking out through Indiegogo?


We are using
  the Indiegogo platform to maintain transparency with our campaign: all the
  stats, numbers, deadlines and dollars raised are real. We want you to know
  that we have the full support of the crowdfunding community to help keep us
  accountable.




Can I get a
  refund?


According to Indiegogo Terms of Use, Pre-order contributions are not refundable. By making a contribution to this campaign, you acknowledge
  that you understand that you are contributing to a work-in-progress and not
  making a direct purchase. BUT we want to be fair and we do understand that sometimes life happens and people's situations change. Thus we will try to handle possible refunds on a case by case basis, but this would be best done after the campaign is completed.
Having said
  that, we would like to also re-iterate that we have put our engineering designs and manufacturing plans through the
  rigorous paces including 3rd party verification and certification from Dragon
  Innovation to verify that our functional prototype and its mass production
  plans are sound. Please see the rigorous 3rd party tests that the
  Volvorii underwent for yourself here:  https://www.dragoninnovation.com/certificates/48-volvorii-by-ishuu-technologies
We also partnered with Morpho MFG, the company that handled  manufacturing for some of the most iconic related hardware crowdfunded projects that got delivered on time, to manage our mass manufacturing as well.
In short, we are just as excited about getting the Volvoriis delivered to you as you are about receiving them. Nothing would make us happier than one day seeing your Pinned images while wearing your customized Volvoriis.




I don't see my
  answer here. Who do I contact?


Please email
  us at jane@ishuu.com. We have a few team members answering emails, so please
  be patient with us & keep in mind that we're getting many customer
  support requests per day. We will get back to you ASAP.

















The Impact
“Using
current definitions the Volvorii is a wearable mobile display, another
variation of Google Glass that just takes a different form factor. With well
designed wearable displays the potential for an unknown talent to create a viral
and epic design that can be a world wallpaper in a matter of days is huge. Thus
there is potential to upset the balance. Just as the MP3 did to the music
industry, wearable displays such  as these are poised to do the same to the fashion industry.
Soon after the Spotifies of the fashion world will rise to take their own places, it’s
inevitable. And it’s not all bad.”",47.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p><b><i><u>My Story</u></i></b></p>
<p>Every time I did my eye make-up, I was
frustrated how long it takes. Instead of having more time and use it for things
that I like to do, I wasted it in front of the mirror. Last year 2014 I started
to think about a solution of this problem and about 6 months later (in August)
I was ready with the design of “Quick Make-up Stencils”. After one more month I found the best possible material for the stencils, the company that started producing them,
the packaging and the manual. I started selling “Quick Make-up Stencils” on
eBay in September 2014. Since then many customers bought the product and love
it. Here are just some of them:</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1256305/files/20150228104942-ebay2.jpg?1425149382"" src="""" style=""cursor: nw-resize;""/></p><br/>

<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">Our Story</h2>
<p>We are a British Colombian family living in the U.K.  We have lived and travelled extensively in Colombia and  always admired the incredible crafts of Colombia's indigenous communities.</p>
<p>Having had the privilege of spending time with indigenous artisans, we have also learnt the many challenges they face in selling their work.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1528882416/ny6h02wblcag2yj8t4t0.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p><strong>         </strong></p>
<p>Through colonization and years of internal conflict Colombia's indigenous communities have been disproportionately affected. This has led to much insecurity and displacement and as a result, they have had little opportunity to sell their crafts internationally. </p>
<p>In 2017, whilst spending time with the Arhuaco people high in the mountains of the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta, we began to explore how we could work together to bring these crafts and their stories to wider audiences, and support these artisans to build healthier and more stable incomes. </p>
<p> From there, our work has extended to three more artisan groups and our commitment has grown to build WATI collective into a platform for indigenous Colombian craft and heritage to be celebrated.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1528839460/r1ild4qnkc6whxt96wf8.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Seeing the increased interest in Colombian crafts globally, along with the growing movement of sustainable and ethical  businesses and organizations working with artisans, we're confident we can do this successfully.</p>
<p>Our vision for the future is that WATI collective becomes more than an outlet for crafts. Together with our artisans, we want to co-create a national network of support, volunteer opportunities, craft and textile trips and to support them in the development of their own community projects.</p>

It’s time we created lingerie that resonates in the language and with the cultural cues that connect with brown skin women.  Have you ever gone to buy something in a 'nude' tone - only to realise their version of nude is completely different to your own?
 
How many times are we, as brown skin women ignored from mainstream fashion?

 
 We want to bring freedom to brown skin women to wear what they want, whenever they want. In the lingerie industry, nine major players manage more than 400 lingerie brands around the globe and yet there is still a ""one nude fits everybody"" mindset. There are only a few new comers entirely dedicated to brown skin women. Which is why, now is our chance to enter the market. We want to bring to light just how very beautiful and diverse our brown skin women are, and offer you the opportunity to celebrate your brilliance.

<b>OUR STORY<br/><br/></b><div>
<p>Hi! We are
Vanya Peshina and Hristo Kostadinov, the founders of Pesh Dept. </p>
<p>We began
Pesh Dept with enthusiasm about three years ago. In the beginning there was the
idea to create shoes that gives maximum satisfaction
to our customers. And so we made superior, able to
personalization, comfortable from day 1, 100% natural, handcrafted
sneakers at attractive price.<br/><br/></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><b>HOW WE GET
HERE AND WHY WE NEED YOUR SUPPORT</b></p>
<p>It took us
three full years to create a small team of specialists with attention to detail
who are supplied with high-quality materials only. Now our small, but united and ambitious team consists of the two of us (Hristo and Vanya) and two more experienced in the art of shoecrafting colleagues (Pepa and Erik).<br/> Over the years, we have
learnt a lot from each other and gained awareness about our customers’ needs.
As a result, we have successfully completed over 600 orders for a period of
three years. Our efforts and products are highly appreciated; however, our team
should further develop and expand because of the the following goals:</p>
<p>· <u>Innovation</u>:
We are aware of the advantages of leather products but we also understand that
some actual and potential customers have moral considerations. Therefore, we
are motivated to create an entirely new “Eco” fashion line which combines
natural non-animal materials: wool, cotton and flax.</p>
<p>· <u>Menswear</u>:
Previously, our products and services targeted solely the female customer
segment. We are currently motivated to enter the male segment and satisfy new
fashion needs.  </p>
<p>· <u>Expanded
team</u>: Our small team is ambitious and has numerous capabilities but it is
insufficient to accomplish the abovementioned goals. Therefore, we need to
further expand our team and production capacity. </p>
<p> Nevertheless, no matter how we want to make our brand better in every way, we need your support to achieve our goal. So if our sneakers correspond with your<br/> taste and style or make you smile- give us your support to achieve our dream to become better.<br/>.</p>

</div><p></p><p>Xtorch was born because we live firsthand the risks of
bicycle driving at night, which has led us to develop this innovative project
keeping in mind the comfort, ease of use and innovation, which took us to
discover a new material never used before that resists rain, direct fire and
friction equivalent to 130 km on the pavement, extreme resistance! Xtorch gives
you complete 360 ​​degree visibility and visual range of more than 500 meters
away. You also have the possibility to signal neighboring vehicles with
steering and brake lights thanks to its precise adjustable brake control
system.</p>
<p>Xtorch is filled with all kinds of sensors! This intelligent
case can alert your family and emergency services in case of accident, turn all
their emergency lights -to make visible if you separate yourself from your
bicycle- and alert a caregiver if he approaches any Smartphone to read your
medical record, making it more efficient and prompt the medical attention.</p>
<p>Xtorch has been tested by cyclists, motorcyclists, skaters
and mountain lovers.    <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106);font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">             </span><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1450194952/ku7i5oj6bozvqbt1hs9f.jpg"" src="""" style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106);font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;width: 535.879px;height: 172px;background-color: initial;""/></p><p><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size: 36px;font-weight: bold;letter-spacing: 1px;line-height: 40px;background-color: initial;"">With your contribution</span><b style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size: 36px;letter-spacing: 1px;line-height: 40px;background-color: initial;""> </b><br/></p><p></p><p>With your contribution, and everyone else, we will include

<h1>Hola Indegogo!Somos la empresa Smart x Security, creadora de xtorch, la mochila
inteligente que es capaz de salvar vidas, revolucionando la conducción de vehículos
livianos.</h1>
<p>Xtorch nace por vivir en carne propia los riesgos de
conducir de noche en bicicleta, lo
que nos ha llevado a desarrollar este innovador proyecto siempre teniendo en
cuenta la comodidad, fácil uso e innovación, lo que nos llevó a descubrir un nuevo material nunca antes
usado que resiste lluvia,
fuego directo y hasta fricción
equivalente a  130km  contra el pavimento, resistencia extrema! Xtorch te proporciona
visibilidad absoluta  en  360 grados y rango visual de más de 500 metros de distancia. También tendrás  la posibilidad de señalar a los vehículos
vecinos con luces de
dirección y freno gracias a su control  ajustable con  sistema freno exacto.</p>
<p>Xtorch está llena
de todo tipo de sensores! Esta carcasa inteligente puede alertar a tus familiares y servicios de emergencia en caso de un accident, encender todas sus luces de emergencia –para hacertevisible si  te separas de tu bicicleta- yalertar al Smartphone de un paramédico si se acerque con cualquier Smartphone para  leer tu ficha medica, haciendo más eficiente y expedita la atención médica. </p>
<p>Xtorch ha sido
probado por ciclistas, motociclistas, patinadores y amantes de la
montaña.</p>

Hello Indegogo! We are the company Smart Security, creators of xtorch,  the smart backpack that can save lives, revolutionizing driving light vehicles through the city.
                     
Xtorch was born because we live firsthand the risks of
bicycle driving at night, which has led us to develop this innovative project
keeping in mind the comfort, ease of use and innovation, which took us to
discover a new material never used before that resists rain, direct fire and
friction equivalent to 130 km on the pavement, extreme resistance! Xtorch gives
you complete 360 ​​degree visibility and visual range of more than 500 meters
away. You also have the possibility to signal neighboring vehicles with
steering and brake lights thanks to its precise adjustable brake control
system.
Xtorch is filled with all kinds of sensors! This intelligent
case can alert your family and emergency services in case of accident, turn all
their emergency lights -to make visible if you separate yourself from your
bicycle- and alert a caregiver if he approaches any Smartphone to read your
medical record, making it more efficient and prompt the medical attention.
Xtorch has been tested by cyclists, motorcyclists, skaters
and mountain lovers.                 With your contribution With your contribution, and everyone else, we will include
improvements in all the devices, helping to develop more and better technology
to reduce the risk of accidents involving cyclists and thus deliver a unique
product in the world with a exclusive guarantee. Our next steps are to develop
our model of social impact and a good strategy to support our users. Also, we
want to develop new colors!      www.x-torch.com

We’re proud to be eco-friendly, vegan and offer you an eco-friendly alternative to your everyday sneaker — with our eco-friendly materials, glue-free shoemaking process; we not only offer you an eco-friendly sneaker but also a cruelty-free shoe that respects animals and the environment. First, we select PETA-approved vegan and all-natural materials, including breathable eco-cotton upper material and durable natural rubber for the soles. These conscious choices not only save animals’ lives but also help reduce our environmental impact.Then, every pair of shoes is handmade by artisans in ethical workshops in Spain, minimizing the environmental impacts and harsh labor practices that plague mass production in the footwear industry.The result is a versatile canvas sneaker you can feel good about wearing.But we don’t stop there — we’ve teamed up with Reforestation Projects so that with every pair sold we plant two (2) trees around the world, restoring healthy forests and employing local villagers with fair wages. By supporting our campaign, you make a choice for the kind of world you want to live in — and the kind of world you want to create for future generations. The St. Tropez is a versatile sneaker that delivers everyday comfort and style — perfect for travel, work, and play.

    It is estimated that over 1 billion animals are slaughtered every year to support the leather and meat industry. While most leather is made from cowhide, it can also come from horses, lambs, cats, and dogs. Before the cattle are killed in slaughterhouses, their short lifespans are often spent in a state of stress, penned up with hundreds of other cows without room to graze.Our shoes are Vegan approved, so you can feel confident that you’re supporting a worthy cause with every step you take.Natural rubber is durable, flexible, and naturally antibacterial. Synthetic rubber is cheaper than natural rubber, but it’s derived from an oil byproduct and contains various chemicals which are known to cause asthma, cancer, liver damage, and other life-threatening illnesses. The St. Tropez natural rubber soles and midsoles provide a higher quality, longer lasting fit, without the array of harmful chemicals found in synthetic rubber.Cotton is a soft, breathable, and resilient fabric: it won’t trap heat or odors like oil-based fabrics. The St. Tropez canvas sneaker features textured cotton upper and a gabardine cotton inner lining, for breathable wear every day. Our unique vulcanized shoemaking process creates a lasting bond between the canvas upper & rubber sole through heat. This process makes for a longer lasting bond between the sole and the shoe upper, it also adds flexibility to the shoe. Unlike cold cement shoemaking processes, the vulcanization process is glue-free, which in turn makes for a healthier shoe, for workers, for the planet and for you! Win, Win, and Win!   Eco-Friendly Mission: We Plant 2 Trees for Every Pair SoldAs planet lovers and #gamechangers who believe in a better world, we also believe in protecting the environment.Like you, we want to do our part to help reverse the alarming rate of carbon emissions in the atmosphere and the disastrous impacts of climate change that threaten all life on this planet.This is why we’ve partnered with Reforestation Projects, that hire villagers to replant native tree species in their local areas that have been deforested, such as Ethiopia, Madagascar, and Haiti.When you buy a pair of our shoes, we plant two trees through Reforestation Projects.Our shoes create big steps for positive change across the globe.

<i>The Creative Collection</i> </h3>
<p>The designs in the ""The Creative Collection"" (the first collection released by The Silence Co) are inspired by the creative process which every artist, creator, innovator, or entrepreneur navigates through. </p>
<p><strong>The 1st design</strong>, ""Silence"", features a <i>sound-wave</i> design that flatlines, representing the purposeful use of silence in the creative process. Silencing the distractions and noises that constantly fight for our attention allows us to rest, reset, and hear our own voice so we can create something that is uniquely us.</p>
<p><strong>The 2nd design</strong>, ""Vision"", features the <i>eye</i> design, representing the creative vision we get which pushes us toward our goal. This is often the most exciting step in the creative process. Vision is what sets our goal and it is what inspires us to push forward til the end. </p>
<p><strong>The 3rd design</strong>, ""Focus"", features the <i>crosshair</i> design, representing the steady focus needed to see your vision through to til it is complete. This is often the most difficult step in the creative process, where the artist, creator, innovator, or entrepreneur experiences the thrills of progress and the frustration of failures, but with Focus, in the end they see the rewards of hard work, and feel pride in what they've accomplished</p>
<p><strong>The 4th design</strong>, ""Legacy"", features the <i>coat of arms</i> design which holds all previous symbols from the collection, with an additional symbol made up of two arrows intersecting through a circle. This symbol represents the people our finished product touches. In that moment we all share something in common even though our lives take us all in different directions. </p>
<h3>Who we are:</h3>
<p>The Silence Co is a clothing and lifestyle brand dedicated to celebrating artists and creatives everywhere. </p>
<p>Our goal is to give a sense of unity to artists and creators.</p>
<p>The first way we will do that is through making cool and unique clothing that gives people a sense of pride and belonging. </p>
<p>I had a dream to create a clothing brand for several years and this year I decided it was time to bring it to life. Because we are representing artists I wanted the products to be handmade. Over the past few months we have researched the art of screen printing. We bought multiple screens, emulsions, inks, squeegees, reclaiming chemicals and tools, a screen printing press, and a curing unit. We have run tests to get the results and quality we are looking for and now we are ready to share this with YOU!</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We are asking for you to support The Silence Co by sharing this campaign and purchasing anything from a sticker to our ""Creative Collection Plus"" package, which includes all 5 shirts and more! Each shirt order will come with a photo of your shirt(s) being hand printed as well as a bumper sticker to show your support everywhere you go! </p>
<p>We would love it if we reached our full goal, or even beyond! But if for any reason we don't, any funds that are raised will still get what you what you ordered all the same, and help The Silence Co become a reality. </p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>

Snuggle up. Support the fight.BIG LOViE is creating a cozy, cuddly way to support the COVID crisis fight.As the makers of soft, snuggly products infused with compassion and kindness, we’re producing a special-edition blanket and hat with 25% of proceeds going to fight the Coronavirus pandemic. This is a perfect way to bring you and those you love warmth and comfort during these unusual times—and beyond. BIG LOViE ‘We Are One’ blankets and hats make meaningful gifts for family, friends, far-flung relatives and hardworking people in your community who deserve heartfelt thanks.At our essence, we are one. Unity matters, now more than ever, in our neighborhoods, our nation and our world. That’s the beautiful message that will appear in light, airy feather threads across the blanket:WE ARE ONE. Earth. People. Love.BIG LOViE blankets are famous for their softness and their unique positive messaging, conveying warm and encouraging sentiments. Sewn on the side on our Ultrasuede label we've added a message that pulls the mission behind this campaign together:Stronger Together. Completely Connected. Kindness Within.Wrap Up and Support the Cause.We’re aiming to do two things:
Raise money to fund medical supplies, deploy emergency staffing to U.S. public health agencies, provide support to vulnerable communities and much more.
Create and deliver blankets and hats that spread comfort, togetherness, connection and unity.
Our goal is to raise $20,000 to fund the production and delivery of the blanket and to donate 25% to the CDC Foundation’s All of Us Combat Coronavirus Campaign. But even if we don’t reach the full goal, we will fulfill all perks and donate 25% to the CDC's campaign, supporting public health measures to help stop the spread of the Coronavirus. Two great ways to get cozy.'WE ARE ONE' BLANKETMade of the same incredibly soft micro-chenille and feather yarn that made the BIG LOViE Dream Collection blankets famous, the ‘We Are One’ blankets are big and beautiful! At 48” X 72”, the ‘We Are One’ blanket will wrap around you like a sweet, soft bear hug.'WE ARE ONE' COTTON BEANIE HATDeliciously soft and wonderfully wearable, the BIG LOViE ‘We Are One’ beanie hats are made of 100% ribbed cotton. Choose from three colors: ivory, black or heather gray.Why is this project important?We are running this campaign now because the fight is now. The need for help is now. But we want to sustain that unifying message to the world long after this crisis ends.  We’ve heard it said that crises can bring people together, and COVID certainly has. Like you, we’re so inspired to see people doing their part in staying safe while helping others. It has been an incredible display of compassion and kindness. With this campaign, we hope to start a movement that will continue this feeling of togetherness and unity. We can’t wait to finalize creating the ‘We Are One’ blankets and beanie hats—and then watch how they are purchased and shared to spread the BIG LOViE love. Together, we’ve got this.The ‘We Are One’ blanket is a new design of a BIG LOViE customer favorite: the Dream Collection blanket.  We’ve already started the process and are creating samples of the new design. We're moving straight into production once colors are approved so we can get your blankets to you as soon as possible. Here is a summary of the timeline:
Indiegogo campaign and ‘We Are One’ blanket and beanie hat production: April thru June 2020
Product shipments begin: July 2020

<p>Do you wonder why curly hair is drier and more fragile than most hair textures?

<p>The great news is our head wraps have been selling out and we've been invited to several high profile shows during festival season. The bad news is we lack the capital and resources to purchase items in bulk for production. Our goal is to raise $5,000 for the production of our Summer line. The Summer line will also launch the Ruby Sampson e-commerce store as well as premier at New Orleans Natural Hair Expo, and Essence Festival Pop Up Mall. Funds raised here will be allocated to the cost of material and labor, any additional funds will cover travel expenses. </p>

Ruby Sampson was founded by Ashley Powdar in 2012 and officially incorporated in February 2016! Named in honor of Ashley's grandmother, Ruby Sampson is designed for the woman with big ideas and a busy lifestyle. 



Do you wonder why curly hair is drier and more fragile than most hair textures? Well, the natural oils of your scalp, which provide nutrients and seal in moisture, take a long time to navigate the curls from root to tip. The natural oil's extra travel time translates into dry ends that succumb to the wear and tear of your everyday routine. 

Ruby Sampson lines all products with silk to reduce hair manipulation that leads to breakage. The silk lining promotes healthy hair growth as the smooth emulsion of the fabric does not snag on your fragile curls nor does it absorb the hair's water. Most importantly, the silk lined head wraps make your hair care regimen more manageable and efficient as this protective styling option requires minimal maintenance.  





2016 is our year and you will help make it unforgettable. We've been invited to New Orleans Natural Hair Care Expo and Essence Festival Pop Up Mall! Please help us streamline our production to launch our Summer Line.

Allocate remainder of investment to cover travel, advertising, and shipping expenses.

Company Cofounders, Maggie Jackman-Pryor and Michele Strobeck had the idea to create some products for their kids and others to help combat all the negative news, messages, and images clouding the media. </p>
<p>Since its inception the company has been using inspiring words on products including clothing, headbands, books, posters, magnets, and more. The Inspired Imprints™ Flip Flop Collection was dreamt up by then 15 year-old company cofounder Hope Pryor.  While sitting on the beach with her family, Hope was writing her name in the sand. Looking up at her mom, Maggie, she said “wouldn’t it be cool to have flip flops that left behind positive words as you walk all over the beach?"" At that moment, the idea for the Inspired Imprints™ Collection was born, Hope officially joined the company's team, and Maggie and Michele were on a mission to bring them to life.  <br/><br/></p><h2 style=""text-align: center;""><span style=""font-size: 24px;letter-spacing: 0px;line-height: 30px;font-weight: bold;background-color: initial;"">Together We Can <br/>Do Better, Feel Better, Be Better™!</span></h2><p></p>

But it turns out there is a lot of science to prove there is something more powerful to this idea! <span style=""background-color: initial;"">
Scientific research shows that surrounding
yourself with inspiring or motivating words can have a tremendous psychological
effect on a person.  Happy and hopeful people are more likely to share
that inspiration with others. By surrounding as many people as we can with small doses of positive and inspiring words, we think we can make a difference. Our goal is to touch the lives of not only the people who wear our flip flops, but the thousands of people who will see the inspiring word trails left behind in the sand.  Like a pebble being dropped into

Introducing Inspired Imprints™ the
first flip flops designed to spread positivity and optimism, one step at a
time.  The patent pending design places
inspiring words into the bottom of your flip flops, leaving a trail as you walk
along the beach or soft ground.  Love, Laugh, Hope, Believe and Dream; the reaction of beach goers seeing the
words imprinted in the sand is priceless!WordUp!® is a company started by two working moms and a high schooler, who want to create a Wave of Optimism all over the world! Company Cofounders, Maggie Jackman-Pryor and Michele Strobeck had the idea to create some products for their kids and others to help combat all the negative news, messages, and images clouding the media. 
Since its inception the company has been using inspiring words on products including clothing, headbands, books, posters, magnets, and more. The Inspired Imprints™ Flip Flop Collection was dreamt up by then 15 year-old company cofounder Hope Pryor.  While sitting on the beach with her family, Hope was writing her name in the sand. Looking up at her mom, Maggie, she said “wouldn’t it be cool to have flip flops that left behind positive words as you walk all over the beach?"" At that moment, the idea for the Inspired Imprints™ Collection was born, Hope officially joined the company's team, and Maggie and Michele were on a mission to bring them to life.  Together We Can Do Better, Feel Better, Be Better™!
WordUP!® is a small company with a big mission: To inspire individuals to see the best in themselves and the world around them.  Every purchase from WordUP!® and the Inspired Imprints™ Flip Flop Collection goes to encouraging others EXPLORE! BELIEVE!
HOPE! and DREAM! We pay-it-forward by dedicating 10% of our profits to supporting clubs and organizations that share our desire to Spread the Wave of
Optimism to people who need it most!Hope's idea for Inspired Imprints™ was simply to make people smile by seeing positive words imprinted in the sand. But it turns out there is a lot of science to prove there is something more powerful to this idea! 
Scientific research shows that surrounding
yourself with inspiring or motivating words can have a tremendous psychological
effect on a person.  Happy and hopeful people are more likely to share
that inspiration with others. By surrounding as many people as we can with small doses of positive and inspiring words, we think we can make a difference. Our goal is to touch the lives of not only the people who wear our flip flops, but the thousands of people who will see the inspiring word trails left behind in the sand.  Like a pebble being dropped into
water, we want Inspired ImprintsTM to have a ripple effect and
create a huge Wave of Optimism!






Making a DREAM! come to life!




After spending more than a year researching product designs and developing relationships with potential manufacturers, WordUP!® has been able to create a fashion forward flip flop that our customers swear are the most comfortable flip flops they have ever worn!
Inspired
Imprints™ Flip Flops are made from the highest quality materials and are sewn, embroidered
and assembled by hand to make them the most comfortable, durable flip flops
you’ll love to wear. 
We need your support of our campaign to bring Inspired Imprints™ to the market and set up distribution channels here in the USA and Canada. Our $33,000 funding goal will be used to place our first large scale production order with our manufacturer. If we reach our initial funding goal of $33,000 we will be able to bring another DREAM! to reality. Our current manufacturer is not able to produce our Inspired Imprints™ Flip Flops in Children's sizes. Going beyond our $33,000 goal will allow us to invest in setting up the children's line as well! Can you imagine a little one toddling across the beach leaving a trail of JOY! in the sand? We can, and we hope you'll help us make that a reality! 



The Perks!





How will I choose my word, sizes, colors?


At the end of the campaign we will send you a link to a page with a form to fill out where you can chose you word/color and indicate your size. Currently we have women's whole sizes 6-11 available in LAUGH!, LOVE!, HOPE!, BELIEVE! and DREAM!  We can't wait to see if our supporters will help us unlock children's and men's sizes too!

<h3>INTRODUCING AVERLEY BOWL AND PLACEMAT SET</h3> <p></p>
<p>It is a suction placemat and bowl set for smart and strong babies.</p>
<p>If you have babies, you know how messy they can get when they start learning to feed themselves. Although it is joyful to watch them eat but, be honest, no one likes the clean up afterwards.

<p>
</p>
<p>I have tried out almost all suction bowls that are currently
on the market but none of them worked. Either they worked only for a few meals or
they could easily be lifted off after a few seconds. My little guy simply popping
the bowl off and sending all the food flying across the room. </p>

This is why we have designed an extra-extra-extra strong suction placemat with a detachable bowl which is unlike any other currently on the market and is able to withstand the strength of even the strongest and most determined babies or toddlers.<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Our motto is simple: less mess + less cleaning = happy mom!</span><br/></p> </div><div>Based on our recent poll, we would like to introduce the following sets for backers to choose from!

<h3>How It Works and What Are the Benefits</h3> <p></p>As parents ourselves, we know that not only you want a mess-free meal for your little one, but you also want a safe one. You’ll be happy to know that our suction placemat is made of 100% FDA approved food grade silicone and the bowl is BPA, PVC, phthalate and lead-free. They are dishwasher and microwave safe and fits most high chair trays. </div><div>Below demonstrates how it works. There is a lever to lock the suction and there are quick snap and release buttons for easy assembly and removal.<br/>
</div><div><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.getaverley.com/images/howitworks.gif"" src=""""/></div><div>

Since the bowl can be detached from the placemat, you can store your child’s leftover food in the refrigerator. The bowl also comes with a lid to prevent moms from making a mess when she brings out the food.<br/>

<p><b><em>SM-ART WATCH / PURSE / STRAP / WALLET</em></b></p>
<p><b><em>M.D. MOTIVATIONAL DEVICES</em></b></p>
<p><strong>Introduction-</strong></p>
<p>Finally, time telling and gazing at digitized information on a display
screen can be one of the most exciting experiences. We have been watching
electronic screens for 70 years now. We want people to be so excited about this
technology that they can't wait to lift up their arms and use this device to
watch images or possibly messages floating in mid-air or rotating around on a
long screen as long as the their watches strap that wraps around their
wrists. 
                                                                    My name is Jay Pirincci and I have a great idea. The story of my
product is about light, space and design using existing technology but in
a more creative manner. This wearable device called M.D. Motivational
Device, a watch/ electronic device  makes efficient use of ALL of its
surrounding space - gathering and displaying digitized information in the most
unique manner in mid-air or as a moving image rotating on a long screen that is
part of the watches strap -but also a device that has side cases on the
strap for carrying basic essential necessities, cosmetics, perfume or tools in a beautifully
designed stylish package. Fun, fashionable and functional.    </p>
<p>We have three designs for our Sm-Art Watches that will make telling time,
reading messages and looking at images the most fabulous experience ever.
These are truly Sm-art Watches.  </p>
<p><strong>Product Information-</strong></p>
<p>1-Holographic- display time in mid-air. Developments in light and
photonics technology allow for methods of displaying information in
mid-air that  has never been used on a watch.</p>
<p>2-Sm-Art Strap- the long strap of the watch is also part of the display
screen. Larger flexible display screens can be developed or merged
together onto the straps of these watches allowing for a much larger
screen and much more information to be displayed.   </p>
<p>3-Smart Purse or Wallet- A Multi-functional Watch with cosmetic and perfume
cases. More useful space and creative areas for containing and carrying the
owners necessities all enhanced by a more stylish design. The main case
will have a compartment for perfume /cologne with a spray. The side cases are
for carrying mascara, rouge, lip gloss, mini-file etc.  This design with
side cases can be used with the holographic design as well. </p>
<p>Additionally the background for each digital display on the screen will have
our own work of art to show off as the background or backdrop for any
display information instead of a simple dark grey screen.  </p>
<p>Here are the electronic  features that will be provided by all
designs-    </p>
<p>Time , date, alarm, Temp, heart rate sensor, bluetooth embedded, touch
screen, text, messaging, internet connectible, Wi-Fi capability, wireless
syncing, charging interface, water resistant  </p>
<p>Here is the cosmetic tools that will be provided by the Smart Purse-</p>

<p>As an active participant in the nerd world/convention circuit (as a fan and a cosplayer), I noticed something was missing -- there was a severe lack of high-quality nerdy themed options for women.

</div><p></p></div>","Classy Looking Nerf Herder is a unique fashion line that mashes up 1940s and 50s vintage styles with your favorite nerdy fandoms. Each design is modeled after real vintage styles, making you the classiest nerd to explore the 'verse!

As an active participant in the nerd world/convention circuit (as a fan and a cosplayer), I noticed something was missing -- there was a severe lack of high-quality nerdy themed options for women. All I saw were t-shirts, pajamas, and corsets. But not much in between. I conceived of Classy Looking Nerf Herder to fill that void (that's what she said).
I pattern, create, and sew every design. Oh, and did I mention?
 Every dress and skirt has pockets. 
POCKETS
Yeah, I know. It's the best.

Although we have an online site, we believe we are not maximizing our full business potential. Our customers need to see our quality and  try on our pieces for fit.   We understand that this is a necessary part of earning our customers trust and ultimately their brand loyalty.  </p><p>In order for us to begin approaching retailers we believe it is necessary that do the following things to help execute or goals:</p><p>1) <strong>To put together a spring 17 presentation during Fall Fashion Week.</strong> We are planning to do a huge launch of our spring 17 line. We are coming out with what we feel will be our best work yet. We are also adding in some new exciting categories that we think will definitely get people excited. We plan to invite retail buyers, media, stylists and fashion influencers(bloggers) to the event to create some buzz around the brand but also engage the buyers to help get placement.  </p><p>2) <strong>Take our collection on the Road!</strong> We want to also make our first ever debut at a fashion apparel trade show. Buyers from all over the country come to  trade shows to shop for their stores so it is the perfect way to come face to face with boutiques from other states that we may not usually get to see. Not only that, when buyers see us at  trade shows they will know we are a serious brand. Our goal here is to generate our first retail sale.</p><h3 style=""text-align: center;""> </h3><h3 style=""text-align: center;""><i><b>HOW YOU CAN HELP</b></i></h3><p>Although doing a presentation and attending a trade show seems pretty simple it can be very expensive.  This is why we need your help!  We are hoping to raise <strong>$20,000</strong> to execute our goals. Below is a breakdown of what your expenses will cover. </p><p><strong> Goal 1. Fashion Week Presentation expenses:</strong></p><ul>
<li><strong>Clothing Samples</strong></li>

<li><strong>Promotional Look Books</strong></li>
<li><strong>Samples</strong></li>
</ul><h3 style=""text-align: center;""><i>Challenges</i></h3><p>In today's fashion world,  there are very few African American brands that are recognized as prominent figures within the industry. Those of us  who do get to a point of recognition are usually pigeonholed into the urban or street wear  brand buckets. This can sometimes be hindering for up and coming contemporary brands like us who target a much broader market  and who are striving to have a presence in contemporary retail outlets. </p><p> As two African American women, our goal  in  this industry is to not only create a successful brand for women of all races but to work to break down these barriers and bring visibility and recognition to the African American fashion community.  </p><p> </p><h2 style=""text-align: center;""><i><strong>Rewards</strong></i></h2><p style=""text-align: center;""><i><strong>In exchange for your generous support we are offering the following perks! </strong></i></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><b><i>Reward 1.

Our customers need to see our quality and  try on our pieces for fit.   We understand that this is a necessary part of earning our customers trust and ultimately their brand loyalty.  In order for us to begin approaching retailers we believe it is necessary that do the following things to help execute or goals:1) To put together a spring 17 presentation during Fall Fashion Week. We are planning to do a huge launch of our spring 17 line. We are coming out with what we feel will be our best work yet. We are also adding in some new exciting categories that we think will definitely get people excited. We plan to invite retail buyers, media, stylists and fashion influencers(bloggers) to the event to create some buzz around the brand but also engage the buyers to help get placement.  2) Take our collection on the Road! We want to also make our first ever debut at a fashion apparel trade show. Buyers from all over the country come to  trade shows to shop for their stores so it is the perfect way to come face to face with boutiques from other states that we may not usually get to see. Not only that, when buyers see us at  trade shows they will know we are a serious brand. Our goal here is to generate our first retail sale. HOW YOU CAN HELPAlthough doing a presentation and attending a trade show seems pretty simple it can be very expensive.  This is why we need your help!  We are hoping to raise $20,000 to execute our goals. Below is a breakdown of what your expenses will cover.  Goal 1. Fashion Week Presentation expenses:
Clothing Samples
Securing a Venue 
Models 
Hair and Make up 
Look Books
 Advertising
 Goal 2. Trade Show Expenses
Entrance Fee
Booth Rental
Fixtures
Signage 
Promotional Look Books
Samples
ChallengesIn today's fashion world,  there are very few African American brands that are recognized as prominent figures within the industry. Those of us  who do get to a point of recognition are usually pigeonholed into the urban or street wear  brand buckets. This can sometimes be hindering for up and coming contemporary brands like us who target a much broader market  and who are striving to have a presence in contemporary retail outlets.  As two African American women, our goal  in  this industry is to not only create a successful brand for women of all races but to work to break down these barriers and bring visibility and recognition to the African American fashion community.   RewardsIn exchange for your generous support we are offering the following perks! Reward 1.

I tried some of the boy shorts, full briefs and other boxer styles that are offered for women but could never get the same coverage and comfort.

<p>When considering fabrics we had 3 goals: <i>comfort, softness and durability</i>. We experimented with cotton, polyester, modal, rayon, lace and other common fabrics and found that rayon from bamboo was one of the softest fabrics with lasting durability. So we decided to make our solid color Briefettes™ of rayon from bamboo/cotton/spandex blend (200 gsm) giving them long lasting durability even after numerous wash and wear. Made from the pulp of bamboo grass, Rayon from Bamboo fabric is light and strong and it does not build up static electricity. Our rayon fabric supplier also holds an OEKO-TEX® Standard 100 certified in natural and sustainable knitted fabrics.</p>

At R'Lano Brands LLC, we believe we can improve people's lives through national and local community partnerships. We understand the importance for our company to operate responsibly and know that you want to buy from a company that works hard to integrate sustainable and responsible practices into all that we do. That is why giving back is an important part of our daily business and once our website launches you can see the different charitable organizations that we are working with in various social arenas. Every purchase of our Briefettes™ allows us to contribute to someone in need. #BriefHug
DETAILS ON OUR LAUNCH
Our products are estimated to retail between $32-$36 dollars due to my decision to use Ethical and Local Manufacturing companies in the USA and keep Americans working; also, the fabrics, elastic and other materials are all top quality. I am making every effort to work with manufacturers who produce our raw materials in the United States creating additional work for people here. With your help, we can place a much larger order to bring you our Briefettes™ at the best price. Depending on which reward you choose, a pair can be delivered to you in our custom designed mailer box for an Early Bird contribution of $26 dollars. We will also be able to introduce the Wedding Collection if we reach the necessary goal of $15,500 and our Active Wear if we reach $25,000.




Help us get the word out! Please share this project with your friends, family and social media connections. And to make it easy on you, there’s an easy “Share this Project” button on the project website that lets you share on Facebook, Twitter, E-mail, or a letter in a bottle. So, share away my friends!
SIZE CHART
TRUE TO SIZE: Our Briefettes™ are designed to fit the curves of a woman. To measure, run a tape measure around your waist and measure hand to hand for a comfortable fit. 


Risks and challengesOnce My Boyfriend’s Briefs™ is successfully funded, I'll do my best to make sure everything goes according to plan to meet the promised deadline. I have manufacturing, operations, and logistics set up and ready to go. The funding raised on this campaign will be used for production and manufacturing. Although we do not see any direct risks and challenges, there are always indirect or unseen tasks that may present itself during the process of production so we'll keep everyone posted and make sure we live up to our end of the bargain.I believe our fans are part of our team, and therefore you will be kept up to date — not only as this campaign, but even after and beyond. Complete transparency is important to us, so you can follow all the behind-the-scenes fun (and sometimes stressful) processes of starting and running a small business.That being said I am so grateful to you for stepping out in faith with me on this incredible journey. I can't thank you enough.Sandra Arellano Minnick, Founder",20.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>About Me</h3>
<p>I am Director of Onyx Cosmetic Beauty Clinic and a mother of two toddlers. Throughout my career customers and colleagues have all discussed with me the concept of skin in care and in particular safe ways to remove make up without the use of harsh chemicals. I always thought there was a solution on the shelf for all needs. I soon discovered this was not the case. It wasn't till I had children that did I realise how much time and expense I put into my beauty cleansing regime. Being time poor and on a budget I was constantly looking for the 'Magic' solution and I couldn't find one anywhere that allowed me to remove my make up quickly and efficiently while not harming the skin. So I decided that since I couldn't find the solution that I should make one and with encouragement from my husband, family and friends that is what I did.</p>

My Invention


A make up removing mitt that removes ALL make up just with the use of water.
Replaces the need for all make up removing cleansers.
Is chemical free, making it safe to use and environmentally friendly.
Is an affordable solution.
Is easy to clean with warm soapy water.
Last on average 18 months before needing to consider replacing.

How It Works


A regular cloth has straight fibres and works similar to a broom that only pushes dirt back and forward, which means very little make up and dirt is removed from the skin.
The unique weave of the Magic Facial Mitt, means that the fibres are looped in a criss cross fashion. This means that dirt and make up gets trapped within these loops, when you lift the Magic Facial Mitt off the skin it lifts with it all the dirt and make up.

Everybody needs that one person who believes in them, I had my grandmother, and I hope I can be that one person for women who do not have anyone. If you would like to reach me, feel free to email me at timbrel@lushbazaar.com I would love to hear from you!

Coexista.com is my response to the terror that has taken place the last years. We live in a more unstable world and the media tends to scare us, but I want to emphasize on the constructive and positive forces. When I travel to screen my films and hold lecturers I meet many people with healthy values and attitudes. Most people are decent and knows right from wrong. They just don’t always get the opportunity to show it. That is why I have made a tool named Coexista. Coexista is an attitude tool shaped in a bracelet that reminds you about your values and helps you show your opinion, rejecting anti-Semitism, islamophobia and extremism.</p><p>Now I am asking you to help me go international. We just launched the French site and I want to translate it into Spanish and German. And wouldn’t it be great with Arabic and Hebrew?</p><p>By buying Coexista jewelleries as holiday gifts for your family and friends you help me spread the message and to finance the development and growth of the charity work. </p><p>Read more about the story and impact <u><strong><a href=""https://www.coexista.com/history/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here</a></strong></u><strong> </strong>on Coexista's homepage.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1480179830/rlsqdwnxedi3em6vj5ba.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p> </p><p><strong>WHY SUPPORT US?</strong></p><ul>
<li>You get to select from one of the awesome perks below depending on the amount of your contribution.</li>
<li>We love bracelets and you probably do too.</li>
<li>Coexista is the perfect gift for confirmations and birthdays, for Christmas, Hanukkah, or Ramadan - or simply as a meaningful appreciation. The jewelry comes with a tag that explains the concept, packed in a delicate jewelry bag made out of resirculated cotton. Coexista is a cool and elegant gift that fits all genders and all ages. Or what about a gift for yourself?</li>
<li>When you wear Coexista jewelry, you show that you reject Islamophobia, anti-Semitism, and growing extremism. You take a stand and you show that you wish for a peaceful coexistence. As an added bonus, you get to dress up with a beautiful piece of jewelry.</li>
<li>Proceeds go to charitable purposes consistent with Coexista’s message.</li>
</ul><p> </p><p><strong>WHAT WE NEED</strong> </p><p>The Coexista bracelets and anklets are in production and has been successfully for a year. We sell them through our webshop and a handful Oslo based retail stores, such as the souvenir shop at the Alfred Nobel’s Peace Centre.</p><p>For 20.000 $ we can translate the website into German, Spanish, Arabic and Hebrew. At the moment it is in English, French and Norwegian. We can also do the necessary upgrading of the software that is called for. We wish to spend some of the money on reaching out, getting the message through by contacting the media and work on the public attention. </p><p>For another 15.000 $ we wish to launch a worldwide competition where young creative designers and jewellers can send in their creations as suggestions for our next Coexista-collection. Three winners will get their design produced. We will celebrate the winners and their designs at a launch that we wish to arrange in cooperation with The Alfred Nobel Peace Centre in Oslo, whom we have worked successfully together with earlier. </p><p> </p><p><strong>WHAT YOU GET</strong> </p><p>Depending on what perk you choose you will get one or several Coexista bracelets.

Coexista.com is my response to the terror that has taken place the last years. We live in a more unstable world and the media tends to scare us, but I want to emphasize on the constructive and positive forces. When I travel to screen my films and hold lecturers I meet many people with healthy values and attitudes. Most people are decent and knows right from wrong. They just don’t always get the opportunity to show it. That is why I have made a tool named Coexista. Coexista is an attitude tool shaped in a bracelet that reminds you about your values and helps you show your opinion, rejecting anti-Semitism, islamophobia and extremism.Now I am asking you to help me go international. We just launched the French site and I want to translate it into Spanish and German. And wouldn’t it be great with Arabic and Hebrew?By buying Coexista jewelleries as holiday gifts for your family and friends you help me spread the message and to finance the development and growth of the charity work. Read more about the story and impact here on Coexista's homepage. WHY SUPPORT US?
You get to select from one of the awesome perks below depending on the amount of your contribution.
We love bracelets and you probably do too.
Coexista is the perfect gift for confirmations and birthdays, for Christmas, Hanukkah, or Ramadan - or simply as a meaningful appreciation. The jewelry comes with a tag that explains the concept, packed in a delicate jewelry bag made out of resirculated cotton. Coexista is a cool and elegant gift that fits all genders and all ages. Or what about a gift for yourself?
When you wear Coexista jewelry, you show that you reject Islamophobia, anti-Semitism, and growing extremism. You take a stand and you show that you wish for a peaceful coexistence. As an added bonus, you get to dress up with a beautiful piece of jewelry.
Proceeds go to charitable purposes consistent with Coexista’s message.
 WHAT WE NEED The Coexista bracelets and anklets are in production and has been successfully for a year. We sell them through our webshop and a handful Oslo based retail stores, such as the souvenir shop at the Alfred Nobel’s Peace Centre.For 20.000 $ we can translate the website into German, Spanish, Arabic and Hebrew. At the moment it is in English, French and Norwegian. We can also do the necessary upgrading of the software that is called for. We wish to spend some of the money on reaching out, getting the message through by contacting the media and work on the public attention. For another 15.000 $ we wish to launch a worldwide competition where young creative designers and jewellers can send in their creations as suggestions for our next Coexista-collection. Three winners will get their design produced. We will celebrate the winners and their designs at a launch that we wish to arrange in cooperation with The Alfred Nobel Peace Centre in Oslo, whom we have worked successfully together with earlier.  WHAT YOU GET Depending on what perk you choose you will get one or several Coexista bracelets.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Both the use of natural materials and simple implementation were primary goals while designing these spectacles. The frame is constructed from plywood made from the wood of local tree species. The outer layer of the profile is walnut, while the inner layers and the temples are made of ash. The special glue used to secure the layers provides enough flexibility for the lenses to be snapped into place at room temperature.While designing these spectacles, it is important that the hinges be manufactured locally and in the simplest way possible. In contrast to traditional hinges, the temples of these spectacles must be rotated 170 degrees inward to close them. The rotation is made possible by specially placed notches on the temples, wooden pins and by a spring-like wooden piece hidden in the frame.</p>
<p>The spring-like movement of the hinges is inspired by the spring mechanism of pocketknives. This springing sensation is caused by the tension that develops at the base of the temple, and is supported by the flexibility and wear resistance of the layered pieces. The use of new technology and renewable, top-quality materials make this frame merely 11g, which provides comfort for the wearer. The hand polished wooden frame highlights the elegance and diversity of natural materials, giving these spectacles further aesthetic value.</p>

<h2>Introducing The Clique 2</h2>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1478205962/iefy8daro58nxuowjtcp.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Don't let the simplicity of The Clique 2 deceive you. It is designed to function smoothly, without effort, without repair or replacement. Compare our wallet with other typical designs that exist, and you will discover that simplicity is much better.</p>
<h3>How The Clique 2 is different from the rest</h3>
<p>-<strong>NO elastic bands or O-rings</strong> that will eventually weaken and break, requiring an exact replacement to be found. No need to keep extra supplies just to be sure you wallet will work the next day.</p>
<p>-NO messing with constantly fighting the stretch tension of elastic or O-rings to try to insert or access your cards and bills. You don't need to practice and practice to get just the ""right"" finger techniques to open the wallet and avoid being embarrassed at the checkout counter.</p>
<p>-NO more dealing with protruding rubber O-rings, elastics or rubber bands that are difficult to smoothly slide into your jean or carry bag pockets. The rubbery surfaces tend to grip onto fabric while inserting or taking out the wallet. This is a daily action which quickly becomes frustrating.</p>
<p>-<strong>NO screws</strong> that will come unscrewed and be lost as has been reported with other wallet designs. Once the tiny screw is lost, where do you find a replacement? Do you need to keep a small jar of screws somewhere at home ""just in case""?</p>
<p>Designing a wallet from a single piece of aluminum was much harder than creating a wallet assembled from multiple parts. However, in order to avoid the issues listed above, we found it was absolutely necessary. As a result, using The Clique 2 is a smooth and pleasant experience.</p>
<p>“Simple can be harder than complex: You have to work hard to get your thinking clean to make it simple. But it’s worth it in the end because once you get there, you can move mountains.” </p>
<p>-Steve Jobs</p>
<h3>Convenience </h3>
<p>Creating the clique 2 wasn't an easy task. It was a meticulous process that involved developing and 3D printing multiple prototypes until we had a product we could stand behind. This obsession all began from the dissatisfaction for a wallet that didn't fit our lifestyles. We found ourselves carrying big leather wallets to hold our credit, gift and ID cards. However, due to the growing convenience of credit cards, the cash compartment was typically unused. This meant that we were utilizing only a small fraction of the wallet; making it an extremely bulky solution.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1478205989/hlghrk3dxkyspxenzh5c.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Size comparison (Clique 2 on the left and traditional wallet on the right)</p>
<p>Not only that, the traditional wallet didn't store the cards conveniently. We would often have to take all the cards out and sort through them to find the one we needed. This was simply not good enough. </p>
<p>With The Clique 2 we have managed to solve these issues. We have created a beautiful slim wallet that conveniently and securely stores numerous cards, while also allowing for easy access.</p>
<h2>How it Works</h2>
<h3>Loading</h3>
<p>Load all your cards at once. (Holds up to 8 cards, 7 with a bill)</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1478206042/vuzuwevqrmqt3fza4s5l.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>The side walls will flex open and retract once the cards are fully inserted</p>

<p> Release and load the top card with ease.</p>
<h3>Access</h3>
<p>Quick access to any card.</p>

<p>Accessing a middle card</p>
<h3>Secure</h3>
<p>Once loaded, your cards are safe and sound.</p>

<p>Shake test</p>
<p>When a card is inserted, The Clique 2 will generate a clicking sound; assuring you the card is secure.</p>

<h3>Kickstand Mode</h3>
<p>Transform The Clique 2 into a phone kickstand with the assistance of one of your cards.</p>

<h3>Appeal</h3>
<p>We designed The Clique 2 with a universal appeal. Perfect for every lifestyle.</p>

<p>Stow it in your purse</p>
<h3>Structure</h3>
<p>An integral part of our objective was creating a structurally sound wallet. So instead of having to rely on fasteners or screws to assemble The Clique 2, we decided to machine it from a single block of aluminum. This was very challenging, because we needed to have walls that flexed but did not bend. So after many software and real world testings, we developed a unique design. One which distributes the stress on the sidewalls into four different regions instead of one. This allows the aluminum to not bend past its threshold and to retain its flexibility.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1478207060/ldxoeueoywo2whtoc2zz.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<p>Dimensions and Features</p>
<h3>Material and Processes</h3>
<p>The Clique 2 is machined from aluminum 6061, which is corrosion resistant. This material is often used for the fabrication of aircraft components and yacht structures. Aluminum 6061 is also light and provides extraordinary strength, which we are confident will suit your demands.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1478207240/sdycbwzsi2of83dyvvcq.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Fresh off the CNC Mill</p>
<p>Once machined, The Clique 2 is then bead blasted and sent off to get anodized. The anodizing process is completed by immersing The Clique 2 in an acid electrolyte bath and running a current through the medium. This electrochemical process adds color, durability, and an anodic oxide coat. The result is a beautiful long lasting finish.</p>

<h3>About Us</h3>
<p>Grand Valor was started by two friends, Jose Ortiz (Mechanical Engineer), and Rafael Jimenez (Electrical Engineer). Both being engineers, we would constantly discuss how to improve items that we used often. On one particular day, we had a discussion about the ways we could redesign and improve the wallet. We really connected with this concept and after several months of research and development The Clique 2 was born. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>                             Thanks For Your Support!!!</h3>

<p>Risks and challenges</p>
<p>Having The Clique 2 manufactured requires a machinist, anodizer, and laser engraver. When having multiple process for production, we have to depend on many people for a smooth operation. To try to mitigate any delays, we have met with several different experts in the respective industries, and selected the most professional and qualified people. Having said that, we have also allocated time for any possible delays that could occur in our manufacturing chain. Essentially, we have embedded a cushion of time for each process when calculating our delivery times.</p>

-NO messing with constantly fighting the stretch tension of elastic or O-rings to try to insert or access your cards and bills. You don't need to practice and practice to get just the ""right"" finger techniques to open the wallet and avoid being embarrassed at the checkout counter.
-NO more dealing with protruding rubber O-rings, elastics or rubber bands that are difficult to smoothly slide into your jean or carry bag pockets. The rubbery surfaces tend to grip onto fabric while inserting or taking out the wallet. This is a daily action which quickly becomes frustrating.
-NO screws that will come unscrewed and be lost as has been reported with other wallet designs. Once the tiny screw is lost, where do you find a replacement? Do you need to keep a small jar of screws somewhere at home ""just in case""?
Designing a wallet from a single piece of aluminum was much harder than creating a wallet assembled from multiple parts. However, in order to avoid the issues listed above, we found it was absolutely necessary. As a result, using The Clique 2 is a smooth and pleasant experience.
“Simple can be harder than complex: You have to work hard to get your thinking clean to make it simple. But it’s worth it in the end because once you get there, you can move mountains.” 
-Steve Jobs
Convenience 
Creating the clique 2 wasn't an easy task. It was a meticulous process that involved developing and 3D printing multiple prototypes until we had a product we could stand behind. This obsession all began from the dissatisfaction for a wallet that didn't fit our lifestyles. We found ourselves carrying big leather wallets to hold our credit, gift and ID cards. However, due to the growing convenience of credit cards, the cash compartment was typically unused. This meant that we were utilizing only a small fraction of the wallet; making it an extremely bulky solution.

Size comparison (Clique 2 on the left and traditional wallet on the right)
Not only that, the traditional wallet didn't store the cards conveniently. We would often have to take all the cards out and sort through them to find the one we needed. This was simply not good enough. 
With The Clique 2 we have managed to solve these issues. We have created a beautiful slim wallet that conveniently and securely stores numerous cards, while also allowing for easy access.
How it Works
Loading
Load all your cards at once. (Holds up to 8 cards, 7 with a bill)

The side walls will flex open and retract once the cards are fully inserted

 Release and load the top card with ease.
Access
Quick access to any card.
 
Accessing a middle card
Secure
Once loaded, your cards are safe and sound.

Shake test
When a card is inserted, The Clique 2 will generate a clicking sound; assuring you the card is secure.

 
Kickstand Mode
Transform The Clique 2 into a phone kickstand with the assistance of one of your cards.

Insert card into Kickstand Slit

Prop up your phone and enjoy hands-free viewing
Design
Appeal
We designed The Clique 2 with a universal appeal. Perfect for every lifestyle.

Great for front pockets
 

Stow it in your purse
Structure
An integral part of our objective was creating a structurally sound wallet. So instead of having to rely on fasteners or screws to assemble The Clique 2, we decided to machine it from a single block of aluminum. This was very challenging, because we needed to have walls that flexed but did not bend. So after many software and real world testings, we developed a unique design. One which distributes the stress on the sidewalls into four different regions instead of one. This allows the aluminum to not bend past its threshold and to retain its flexibility.

Dimensions and Features
Material and Processes
The Clique 2 is machined from aluminum 6061, which is corrosion resistant. This material is often used for the fabrication of aircraft components and yacht structures. Aluminum 6061 is also light and provides extraordinary strength, which we are confident will suit your demands.

Fresh off the CNC Mill
Once machined, The Clique 2 is then bead blasted and sent off to get anodized. The anodizing process is completed by immersing The Clique 2 in an acid electrolyte bath and running a current through the medium. This electrochemical process adds color, durability, and an anodic oxide coat. The result is a beautiful long lasting finish.

Available in Titanium Grey or Carbon Black
 
About Us
Grand Valor was started by two friends, Jose Ortiz (Mechanical Engineer), and Rafael Jimenez (Electrical Engineer). Both being engineers, we would constantly discuss how to improve items that we used often. On one particular day, we had a discussion about the ways we could redesign and improve the wallet. We really connected with this concept and after several months of research and development The Clique 2 was born. 
 
                             Thanks For Your Support!!!

Risks and challenges
Having The Clique 2 manufactured requires a machinist, anodizer, and laser engraver. When having multiple process for production, we have to depend on many people for a smooth operation. To try to mitigate any delays, we have met with several different experts in the respective industries, and selected the most professional and qualified people. Having said that, we have also allocated time for any possible delays that could occur in our manufacturing chain. Essentially, we have embedded a cushion of time for each process when calculating our delivery times.",15.0,1,"2 Campaigns

<h2>MY Story:</h2>
<p>I was raised in Southern California where I was immersed in a world of creativity. From following my older sister to dance class, spending summers in my father's photography studio, to watching my mother paint it always seemed I was destined to travel a creative path. At the age of ten I spent the summer learning the artisan tradition of bead weaving from a family friend Frank ""Frankie"" Perez. Frankie was an old soul and authentic to his core. I thought he was the coolest and even double stacked rings on my fingers to imitate him. Good thing no photographs exist of those days as I never really pulled it off like he did. :) He made his own jewelry, tumbled and cut his own stones, worked with metal and was a master bead weaver working on his handmade loom. It was this last artisan tradition that I spent much of my summer learning. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1499060889/xrqblkjq1x919v2wa2ds.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>That's me and Frankie circa early 2000's</p>
<p>Upon Frank's passing, while I was still attending New York University, Frank's wife handed down his loom to me. I was honored to be given his hand made loom but I was on a path to be a professional dancer... or so I thought. While I worked on a custom-order basis I did not fully realize the vision for Lock and Key for another fifteen years. <br/><br/>After spending over a decade as a professional dancer, working in the television and theatre industries, I found myself injured and in the middle of a ""Who am I Anyway"" moment. My skills at hand sewing, scenic and costume design helped land me a job, and the beginning of a new career, in the New York fashion industry working for some of the top designers in the world. After traveling back to Los Angeles and continuing to gain invaluable experience I settled down, with my wife and toddler son, in Nashville where Lock and Key found its roots. <br/><br/>When I am not on the loom I am getting my hands and feet dirty, creatively speaking, when ever possible. From graphic and textile design to modern, tap, classical ballet and yoga my mind and body are always on the go. <br/><br/><strong>The Designs:</strong><br/><br/>Lock and Key brings a touch of modern eclecticism and international cool to each collection. By fusing Native American beading, I am some what cetain frankie was Hopi Indian, with classic ball-and-chain Lock and Key connects the past with the present. Each piece is hand beaded and/or loomed with the ball-and-chain interweaving with the beading seamlessly. I also work with my Grandftaher's clay tools hand scultping bronze and Sterling silver metal clay pendants. It is an amazing process which I can not wait to share with you further.</p>

<p><br/>Each collection is seasonal and researching the semi-precious stones is one aspect of the process I cherish. Being a proud bolo tie wearer and rock tumbler as a kid I feel I have come full tumble. :)</p>

<p><br/>Each style has been named after a notable person in history with a bit of intrigue bringing even more depth to each piece of jewelry. With an iconic lock charm finishing off each Lock &amp; Key piece, the jewelry urges wearers to continue the story sharing the piece's as well as a bit of their own.<br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1499061131/qyjexw0bv4u4qvfejm01.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

Your Impact:
Your funding will allow me to apply for additional juried art shows for the 2018 fiscal year. There are amazing art shows around the country and your support will allow me to take the risk in new cities and in front of new audiences.

E-Commerce:
I launched my website http://www.lockandkeydesign.com in early 2016. I have seen some success but I am missing the opportunity to capture the on-line consumer.

Many viewing my collection in Atlanta suggested I also attend the Dallas market. With a great high end clientele it can be a key market for Lock and Key. Your funding will help me attend my first wholesale market in Dallas in 2018. 
MARKETING:
I am always trying to think outside the box. From private trunk shows, new partnerships and pop up events I am always trying to reach my consumers in new ways. I am excited to announce I will be featured in the August issue of Nashville Arts Magazine.
Your impact:
All of the above have expenses and I want to continue to do new events as consumers attention needs to be captured by excited, outside the box experiences.
RECAP:
As the Owner, Designer, Marketing and Sales Director and all around Maker and Shaker it is time to reach out to you and ask to help me take the next step. 2017 has been a big year so far. 
And don't forget about 2018...  new national markets, new juried art shows which will mean expanding my team to include additional production help because with each new market there will be new orders, more raw materials and faster hands.

I need $15,000 in order to take the next steps needed to grow my small business.
I have really fun and amazing EXCLUSIVE perks to thank you for supporting my journey.
Every bit helps. 

There Are ALWAYS Risks:
I am grateful to each and every one of you. I want you to know that my goals listed above are very intentional and have been thoughtfully decided upon from the learnings I have gained over the past three years of sweat equity I have invested into Lock and Key. This has taught me, amongst many other things, to mitigate as much risk as possible and always, ALWAYS be able to be flexible so if something is not working STOP and move forward with anew plan.
In addition I was accepted into a small business training course called Periscope through the Arts and Business Council of Nashville. Not only will I will leave a stronger small business owner but I will be partnered with a business mentor to continue my growth. 
Because I don't know how many orders I will get from this campaign, I am putting an estimated ship date of October on all orders to give myself a little extra time to produce everything. While realistically I will be able to get the perks not hand made by myself out earlier, there is always a possibility of an overwhelming response and I want to ensure that I can get everyone taken care of by the date I have promised.
Lastly I have been training part time employees and interns my craft. I am ready to offer them more hours/pay to meet  the production growth and your funding will allow this to happen.

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Born in Liberia, West Africa and raised in different countries around the globe, I have always been a cultural nomad and anomaly wherever I went. Thanks to the unexpected support from my father, I gave up my acceptance into a  prominent agricultural program to study fashion design instead.</p>
<p>I knew by doing what I loved, I would one day, achieve something great, not for myself, but for those who pushed me to pursue my dreams and, for those who never had the opportunities my parents provided me.</p>
<p>It all started with a piece of fabric, some thread and an old sewing machine. I wanted something that could defy the status quo. It was an arduous process that took numerous years and multiple filings with the US Patent Office, but it finally paid off and the patent approval was granted in mid 2016.</p>
<h3>Why Fund this campaign ?</h3>
<p>I am asking you, to pledge your hard earned money for a purse; simple as that! Except, this is not any other fashion accessory. </p>
<p>This is a patented, never before seen bag ,that solves many problems for the modern day individual, looking to establish and link their identity to what they wear. It is not only about perception but most importantly, about utility and the ability to compliment the wearers lifestyle without much effort. Flexibility and versatility  across different lifestyles are its key features.</p>
<p>By funding this campaign, you will be a pioneer in making this Invention come into realization on a global scale. You will push this invention further and be a part of a much larger movement.</p>
<p>The ultimate goal is to create a brand using this patented bag as a catalyst for the establishment of a fashion powerhouse.  I intend to create a business focused around cultivating unique ideas and talents like mine in a manner that is socially responsible and a means to help those who would be otherwise be overlooked, and exploited.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The first and most difficult hurdle has been conquered- I HAVE A PATENT  !!!!</p>
<p><strong><u>Sourcing and Procurement</u></strong></p>
<p> The fabrics and trims required for production will be ordered after the campaign closes. Possible challenges may include limited supply of initially proposed material, and delay in receiving the supplies which could push the delivery time further out.</p>
<p><strong><u>Manufacturing  </u></strong></p>
<p>The first collection will be manufactured by a Small, local manufacturing company.

Born in Liberia, West Africa and raised in different countries around the globe, I have always been a cultural nomad and anomaly wherever I went. Thanks to the unexpected support from my father, I gave up my acceptance into a  prominent agricultural program to study fashion design instead.
I knew by doing what I loved, I would one day, achieve something great, not for myself, but for those who pushed me to pursue my dreams and, for those who never had the opportunities my parents provided me.
It all started with a piece of fabric, some thread and an old sewing machine. I wanted something that could defy the status quo. It was an arduous process that took numerous years and multiple filings with the US Patent Office, but it finally paid off and the patent approval was granted in mid 2016.
Why Fund this campaign ?
I am asking you, to pledge your hard earned money for a purse; simple as that! Except, this is not any other fashion accessory. 
This is a patented, never before seen bag ,that solves many problems for the modern day individual, looking to establish and link their identity to what they wear. It is not only about perception but most importantly, about utility and the ability to compliment the wearers lifestyle without much effort. Flexibility and versatility  across different lifestyles are its key features.
By funding this campaign, you will be a pioneer in making this Invention come into realization on a global scale. You will push this invention further and be a part of a much larger movement.
The ultimate goal is to create a brand using this patented bag as a catalyst for the establishment of a fashion powerhouse.  I intend to create a business focused around cultivating unique ideas and talents like mine in a manner that is socially responsible and a means to help those who would be otherwise be overlooked, and exploited.
 

Risks & Challenges
The first and most difficult hurdle has been conquered- I HAVE A PATENT  !!!!
Sourcing and Procurement
 The fabrics and trims required for production will be ordered after the campaign closes. Possible challenges may include limited supply of initially proposed material, and delay in receiving the supplies which could push the delivery time further out.
Manufacturing  
The first collection will be manufactured by a Small, local manufacturing company. Due to the the fact that this is the first time the product will be manufactured on a large scale and given that it is a brand new invention, there may be challenges as it  relates to production planning and implementing lean production techniques.
Knowing the potential challenges that may arise, I have considered alternative sourcing and manufacturing strategies that will help prevent any major setback.

<h3>Let's Get to the Point</h3>
<p>Hi, hello, hey there! Let me begin by saying <strong>Thank You</strong> for checking out my campaign, you're fantastic! </p>
<p>If you haven't heard yet, I want to become a LuLaRoe consultant.</p>
<p>I love how LuLaRoe makes me feel and it's the type of clothing I've been searching for my entire life: comfortable, colorful and a little wild. The joy I feel when I pull my leggings on and hop into a dress is an experience I want every person to also have when they put on an outfit because it's clothing and we spend our lives in them.</p>
<p><strong>But wait, what IS LuLaRoe?</strong></p>
<p>Great question! LuLaRoe is a young company created by a fantastic woman that wanted to be able to spend time with her children while also making money and living life in stylish comfort. They make clothing that is stylish, comfortable and unique. Each colorful pattern printed is limited, meaning only a select number of clothing pieces will be made from each print. So while you may be wearing the same style of dress, skirt or shirt as many other people, it's very unlikely you'll have the same prints.</p>
<p><strong>Ok, Ok, that's great. So why do you want to sell LuLaRoe?</strong></p>
<p>I want people to love wearing the clothing they live their lives in. And I want people to feel just as comfortable, beautiful and confident as I do when I put on my LuLaRoe. I think that I can bring this to people by becoming a consultant, but I cannot attain this goal alone, so I'm asking for your help. I'm not asking for something in return for nothing, though. You will notice in the Perks that there is a little something for just about everyone, whether you're looking for LuLaRoe clothing, artwork, a personalized drawing or a little bit of everything (my personal favorite). </p>
<p>Another reason I want to sell LuLaRoe is because I believe it will be a job I can maintain while my life changes. In the next few years, I want to move to the other side of the country and hopefully start a family. My current job is something I love doing, but unfortunately I cannot take that same job cross country with me. LuLaRoe is a flexible business that I can manage from anywhere and that's exactly what I need.</p>
<p>Please consider choosing a Perk and helping me become a LuLaRoe consultant. By backing this campaign, however big or small your contribution, you will be helping me to not only achieve my goal, but you'll be aiding me in bringing confidence, comfort and joy to other people. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Alright, let's break down the details: </p>
<p>You'll have noticed I'm asking for $7,500 which is definitely not a small amount of money, that's for sure, which is why I need the help of many. A big chunk of that money, about $5,500 to be specific, goes toward my LuLaRoe initial inventory of clothing. That inventory will be my consultant bread and butter, full of so many fantastic patterns and colors, you just cannot even begin to imagine all the variety!</p>
<p>The rest of that money is for my other consulting needs, such as storage bins, clothing racks, mannequin, branding, etc. Any and all money made with this campaign is going into the supplies and inventory I need to run this business. Anything extra will go toward more LuLaRoe styles and leggings. So all the money made is going directly into bringing more fantastic clothes to lovely people in my area.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact LuLaRoe has had on Me</h3>
<p>As a curvy girl, I have always viewed clothing as something that could be an expression of myself, but it also always felt limiting and sometimes uncomfortable. Shopping was a gamble: either I would find clothing that fit perfectly, but was relatively simple or boring, or I would find pieces which were colorful and full of wild patterns, but were either too tight in certain spots or completely unflattering. Then I found LuLaRoe and it felt like I stumbled into the sisterhood's pants and my clothing dreams came true.</p>
<p>I have tried every style that LuLaRoe offers and in each style, I fit in different sizes. As a large and curvy woman, weighing in around 250 lbs, I expect to only be able to squeeze these lumps into 2XLs or larger. Then I stumbled into LuLaRoe. In some styles, I can wear anything from a size medium up to a 3XL. Do you know how refreshing and empowering it is to feel like a normal sized person and not feel shamed by a label? Because it's really fantastic. <strong>Fan. Tas. Tic.</strong></p>
<p>And it's not just the clothing that's all encompassing. Just about every person that I've met through the magic that is LuLaRoe has been uplifting, friendly and more than happy to help. LuLaRoe brings together and unites women in such a great way. Every body loves seeing what outfits everyone else it putting together, how they're combining patterns and making a statement. Looking for a specific print or style? Just ask people in the LuLaRoe community and you'll find a sea of voices, volunteering to help.</p>
<p>This community warms my soul and I want to continue to propagate the magic of LuLaRoe by being part of the consultant family.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>My biggest challenge is raising the money. Financially speaking, I make just enough money to skate by, pay monthly student loan payments, and fill my gas tank, while throwing what pennies I have left into my savings account. Whatever money you can donate to help me start as a LuLaRoe consultant will help! Even if I do not raise the set goal amount, I will still become a consultant, it will just take a little longer.</p>
<p>Starting this campaign is a risk, but I'm ready for a new adventure and I can only see this campaign as a stepping stone that'll help me to achieve my goals</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>As a person with limited means, I completely understand if you can't spare any funds at the time. You know what you can do, though? I'd really appreciate if you could help me spread the word and tell your friends and family about my campaign. Share my campaign on social media, tell your work friends about it, etc. Every little bit helps.</p>
<p>Thank you again for reading through my campaign! &lt;3</p>

The main advantages of this kind of leather are its total eco-friendliness and the luxurious look achieved through the unique ageing effect that brings out an attractive patina and patches of wear. This kind of technology has its drawbacks too, of course: processing with plant ingredients takes longer, so the material costs more.

We start by choosing the best pieces of hide on the roll, then cutting them out and sending them for laser cutting and engraving. Next, we impregnate the hide with oils and waxes, and leave it to dry for 1-2 days. Then, we dye it, work the edges and treat the leather in finisher.

Important! As we dye our leather by hand, texture and shade may vary slightly from that shown in photos.We will be happy to consider your suggestions for the color of our products.We are prepared to produce our wallets in any new color if it is suggested by a large number of people and if the reproducing the color is technically feasible. But the project needs to raise over $4,000 first.We will send out a survey at the end of the campaign for you to designate your leather and thread color choice as well as text for engraving. We know how to work with leather, and we are ready to start fulfilling orders! Our prototypes are ready, and we have made arrangements with a leather supplier, so we can start production in as little as two week after raising the necessary funds – that is how long we will need to sign the rental agreement and carry out the initial fit-out of the workshop.We plan to make and ship approximately 120-150 goods per month. That is the number of orders we can fulfill while maintaining the high quality of our product. However, if we get a great many orders (over 300), we will raise our productivity by hiring and training new people.Orders will be dispatched by first-class mail (with tracking number). Delivery to Europe and North America normally takes 10-16 days. We guarantee prompt dispatch of goods, but delivery times are, unfortunately, not under our control.  If you need to receive your item urgently, please tell us. We will ship your order via a courier service. But the courier service will be at your expense.Additional customs duties may be charged in your country. In that event, you will have to pay them yourself. Please be prepared for this eventuality. NATURAL MATERIALS. In our country, unfortunately, the eco-friendly style is not yet all that popular. But we believe that eco-friendliness is the way to go, and we are striving to make our production as safe as possible for nature and for people.100% VEGETABLE-TANNED LEATHER. We have selected top-quality 3-oz buffalo leather as our main material. What distinguishes vegetable-tanned leather from ordinary natural (chrome-tanned) leather is that only natural ingredients, like oak bark, mimosa etc., are used in processing it. The main advantages of this kind of leather are its total eco-friendliness and the luxurious look achieved through the unique ageing effect that brings out an attractive patina and patches of wear. This kind of technology has its drawbacks too, of course: processing with plant ingredients takes longer, so the material costs more. But the high quality and durability of the product fully makes up for this.NATURAL OILS, DYES AND WAXES. We use natural oils, dyes and wax that we make ourselves to color and process the leather. To protect the leather from environmental effects, we apply a special finish from US manufacturer Eco-Flo. Unfortunately, we cannot supply information about the composition of this product as it is a trade secret of the manufacturer.HANDCRAFTAT most every stage of production is carried out by hand by our craftspeople. We start by choosing the best pieces of hide on the roll, then cutting them out and sending them for laser cutting and engraving. Next, we impregnate the hide with oils and waxes, and leave it to dry for 1-2 days. Then, we dye it, work the edges and treat the leather in finisher. In the final stage, we hand-sew the parts together with a straight double stitch. This is our first Indiegogo project, but we are fully confident of our abilities. We believe to our work and our designs so strongly that we warranty them against defects in materials.  If there ever is a problem with one of our products just send it back and we will repair or replace it for free!As with any project, the main risk is a delay in the supply of materials. The likelihood of this is low, but we feel ourselves duty bound to flag it up. In any event, the quality of your order will be high!We will pleasantly surprise you!Please support our project!",25.0,0,"1 Campaign

To have a good timepiece that gives you good indication of the time and last long, you need to look for a watch movement when you are going to purchase one.  We at Louis Monti have chosen one of the best movements made by Japanese Miyota/Citizen Ltd.  The model we have used for our first collection is Miyota 6P00. Movement Guide:Moonphase:Moon has been the first way of keeping the track of calendar throughout the history and it has been used by travelers to find their ways. A calendar that is based on the moon is called a lunar calendar which has 12 months and each month is 29 ½ days. Despite Gregorian calendar being common and legal in most countries , traditional lunar  calendar continues to be used in many countries to determine special occasions such as Ramadan, Eids (Islamic calendar) The moonphase on Louis Monti timepieces indicates the position of the moon.  Case Material:The material that we have used to make Louis Monti cases are 316L stainless steel which is the highest grade of stainless steel   Water Resistance of Louis Monti:Our watches are 5ATM water resistant. It means it will resist water getting inside until the pressure of the water is 5 Atm.Waterproof Guide: Warranty:We are confident with the quality and durability of our watches and therefore, we offer 24 months warranty from date of purchase. We would accept to repair, fix or even replace if something were to happen to your Louis Monti watch during this period.Please note that, the warranty does not cover:  
The life of the battery 
Any damage on any part of the watch resulting from abnormal/abusive use, lack of care, negligence, accidents (knocks dents, crushing, broken crystal, etc.) 
Water damage unless marked “5 ATM” up water resistance
  Louis Monti vs Retail:  Where is Louis Monti headed to?As watch enthusiasts, we want to have full range of different types and styles for different choices of timepiece lovers and with affordable price. We have intended to combine middle-east and far-east craftsmanship and materials to use our watches. Therefore, please join us on this journey, be part of it every step of the way and support us to make this happen successfully. We are there to update you throughout the entire process and we will make sure that our bakers are up to date on any new and important information. We want to create a bond and trust with our backers, because it is you who are turning this dream into a reality.We Need Your Support!In order to turn this dream of ours into a reality, we need your support. It does not only mean pledging for one of our awesome watches, but sharing the story with family and friends. The important thing to remember with IndieGogo is, if we do not reach our full funding goal, we get nothing. https://www.facebook.com/LouisMontiTimepiece/We are going to do everything we can to spread the word in a variety of ways.  We hope that, through the use of social media and blogs we can drive enough outside traffic to our page which will result in us reaching our funding goal.  If you could do something as simple as tweeting about our page, or just liking our Facebook page, it can really go a long way.

<p>For me, the passion to put an end to gun violence started after the Sandy Hook school shooting. I was watching news story after news story, listening to tributes after tribute watching little innocent faces crowd my TV screen and I was overcome with emotion, numb and scared. </p>
<p>What can we do, what could have bee done to prevent this? These questions and thoughts kept reeling through my head for days on end.</p>
<p>More and more countless acts of gun violence just kept coming through my television screen and news feed for months and years to come. It was becoming too much of a regular occurrence. </p>
<p>Then the Orlando Nightclub shooting that happened in 2016 —  My best friend was visiting her sister in Orlando at the time. She was completely unreachable until the morning hours. Could she have been in the club and one of the 102 victims hurt, killed or traumatized during that horrific incident? </p>
<p>I wasn't sure. So much so, that her family almost boarded a plane to reunify with them to provide them safety and comfort after this horrific event.</p>
<p>More so, the Orlando Nightclub massacre was an attack on my community of the LGBTQ people.</p>
<p>As a Lesbian woman, I felt deeply saddened that a person could target a group of people for loving who they want to love. </p>
<p>Las Vegas, Nevada in 2017 — Stephen Craig Paddock, 64, fired a barrage of rapid gunfire from his 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino leaving 546 injured and causing 58 fatalities.</p>

<p>A phone call with a young mother who shared with me that a few of her friends were being treated for gunshot wounds who were at the concert. She wasn't sure if they were going to be okay.</p>
<p>She was planning on bringing her daughter to the concert and backed out last minute because she couldn't find a babysitter to watch her younger children. I was stunned. Was an angel watching over her? </p>
<p>Countless shootings have happened time and time again, leaving me feeling hopeless and even more powerless than before. </p>
<p>When will a horrific event like this happen again? </p>
<p>Well it was most recently when a man and his wife open fired into a Kosher market in my own community of Jersey City, New Jersey. An attack meant to target and kill the Jewish people. This incident left 4 killed and 3 injured. </p>
<p>I am Jewish and I live 1 mile away from where this shooting occurred.</p>
<p>This was an attack on religious freedom. Aren't we allowed to practice the religion without persecution?</p>

<p>Welcome to my idea for an animal friendly, virtually indestructible belt. It's called the Belt of Orion. It will do a great job of keeping your pants while at the same time.... not hurting any animals. The best part about this belt is the durability. It won't crack at the holes like a lot of belts out there seem to do. This belt will LAST! And, to reassure you, I'm backing it with a four-year guarantee.

<h3>Why Vegan??? </h3>
<p> Over the past decade it has come to light that animals are not being treated with respect or dignity. We’ve seen millions of acres of trees being cut down to make room for animal agriculture. And this year we are really learning the truth about what is going on in wet markets. It doesn’t make sense. Do we REALLY need to keep abusing animals in this day and age? HECK NO! Animal agriculture is one of the top polluters on our planet. There is another way. You know what's cool? Compassion... and belts that last! </p>
<h3>What's it made of?</h3>
<p>Years ago we discovered a revolutionary new material being used by the Mennonites in St. Jacobs, Canada. They use it for their horses’ reins and harnesses. It's stronger than leather and does not stretch and crack at the holes over time. And, it's 100% animal friendly. Cool! It's called coated webbing.</p>
<p>Coated webbing is made from a core material of seat belt webbing, which is incredibly strong. Then that webbing is coated with the highest-grade vinyl made in the United States and complies with North American standards (PROP 65, REACH, CPSIA 2008). This same material is also used in the medical, sporting goods, safety and military industries.</p>
<p>You're probably asking, why use vinyl? In my opinion, it's far more humane to use man-made materials instead of a skin of an animal, which was treated poorly, abused and killed. By supporting man-made materials, more innovation will go into the longevity and recyclability aspects of these materials.</p>
<p>Did you to know that, after all the chemical treatments required to make a ""genuine leather belt,"" the original animal skin becomes non-recyclable and non-biodegradable? The belt of Orion is ""genuine non-leather"".  </p>
<p>The BELT OF ORION comes in 3 different colours and in the below sizes. Custom sizes are available. There are 6 holes for adjustment. The available sizes are 28, 30, 32, 34, 36, 38, 40, 42, 44 (in inches).</p>

<h3>Why the name ""ORION""?</h3>
<p>Orion’s Belt is the name of a collection of stars that are a part of Orion, one of the most popular and recognisable constellations in our night sky. Orion’s Belt is made of three stars arranged in a seemingly perfect line. The full constellation looks like a stick figure and these three stars make up Orion’s belt.</p>
<p>Over the centuries, many stories have made Orion to be a hunter or a warrior. And now the year is 2020 and I made up my own story.  I see this stick figure as an archer .... </p>
<p>This archer is a magical being who has super powers. She shoots a magical light arrow to Earth. The magic of this arrow wakes us humans up to the fact that we are all interconnected and that what happens in one part of the planet affects us all. The arrow has three words engraved on it. LOVE, LIGHT and TRUTH.</p>
<p><strong>But seriously... who is this 'Being' in the sky, who is going to help create change on planet earth?</strong></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1594684805/b1824sfexff86wma9vy9.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>YOU are the one who will make changes on earth. With the choices you make, the way you treat yourself, others and animals, and the companies and products you support, YOU make a HUGE difference. Each choice you make affects all living things in ways you can't even conceive of. By funding just one Orion belt, you will help decrease the unnecessary pain and suffering of animals. </p>
<h3><strong>Where I am in the development of this belt?</strong></h3>
<p>I have everything in place to manufacture and ship the Belt of Orion ot you. The buckle mold has been custom designed and paid for, and everything else is in place to start manufacturing the Belt of Orion… after that, it can ship to you!</p>
<p>The last hurdle is to order a minimum quantity of 1000 units for the buckle and the minimum order quantity for the coated webbing strap material. That is why I need your help, Kickstarter!</p>
<p>Once the Belt of Orion is funded and on the market it will be available on my website (around November/December of 2020) at <a href=""http://Where%20I%20am%20in%20the%20development%20of%20this%20belt?%20I%20have%20everything%20in%20place%20to%20manufacture%20and%20ship%20the%20Belt%20of%20Orion%20ot%20you.%20The%20buckle%20mold%20has%20been%20custom%20designed%20and%20paid%20for,%20and%20everything%20else%20is%20in%20place%20to%20start%20manufacturing%20the%20Belt%20of%20Orion%E2%80%A6%20after%20that,%20it%20can%20ship%20to%20you!%20The%20last%20hurdle%20is%20to%20order%20a%20minimum%20quantity%20of%201000%20units%20for%20the%20buckle%20and%20the%20minimum%20order%20quantity%20for%20the%20coated%20webbing%20strap%20material.%20That%20is%20why%20I%20need%20your%20help,%20Kickstarter!%20Once%20the%20Belt%20of%20Orion%20is%20funded%20and%20on%20the%20market,%20I%20plan%20on%20offering%20the%20BELT%20OF%20ORION%20on%20my%20website%20(around%20November/December%20of%202020)%20at%20www.truthbelts.com%20where%20one%20tree%20will%20be%20planted%20with%20every%20purchase%20of%20this%20belt.%20This%20will%20happen%20after%20the%20Orion%20belts%20are%20all%20shipped%20out%20to%20those%20who%20have%20funded%20it%20here%20on%20Kickstarter."" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.truthbelts.com</a> where one tree will be planted with every purchase of this belt. </p>

<h3>What's it made of?</h3>
<p>The strap is a coated webbing. I discovered this material from the Mennonites in a town called St Jacobs. They use it for their horses reins and harnesses because it is stronger than leather and will not crack at the holes. The core of the strap is seat belt webbing, which is incredibly strong.

</div></div>","Welcome to my idea for an animal friendly, virtually indestructible belt. It's called the Belt of Orion. It will do a great job of keeping your pants while at the same time.... not hurting any animals. The best part about this belt is the durability. It won't crack at the holes like a lot of belts out there seem to do. This belt will LAST! And, to reassure you, I'm backing it with a four-year guarantee. This belt will also plant trees on earth... eventually... with your help! Read on to find out how.
As an accessory to the belt I am offering a unisex masculine -looking bracelet. It has a magnetic closure and the metal is nickel free. Available in different sizes and in black semi-gloss only.

This is on the grounds that the innovative work expenses of watch developments stay high, requiring modern and costly preparing gear, and considerably more experienced specialized faculty. This is certifiably not a beneficial thing. You know, there are in excess of 200 sections for a development, and each part should be delivered in enormous amounts to decrease the expense. These make it practically unthinkable for us to build up development for a model. This is the reason the plans of watches available are broken. Everybody utilizes a similar development.</p>
<p>The Swiss tackled this issue. Richard Miller, Roger Dubuis, De Bethune, F. P. Journe, Franck Muller, and so on., this arrangement of incredible names speaks to the high degree of the watch business as far as to plan and assembling. They all grow new modules dependent on the ETA development, change the method of perusing, and include new capacities. Make it totally extraordinary. In any case, because of value reasons, the standard will never have one in the course of their life. What a pity!</p>
<p>As an organization with the capacity to create watch developments, we have explained this problem. We started to choose and test the steady and reasonable fundamental mechanical development years prior. As indicated by the plan of the watch, a lot of modules are created on this premise. Much the same as the Swiss Independent watchmaker. Presently, the WINDOWS arrangement is directly before your eyes.ATOWAK will be a really one of a kind encounter for you.</p>

<p>In the event that you are befuddled by the looks and the component of how the watch functions, it is as entrancing as it looks. We have made an extraordinary mechanical development for the watch window to peruse on a level plane rather than the regular exhausting roundabout movement. We intend to bring a high bore watching the market that coordinates the moxy and nature of very good quality programmed watches. The development of the watch is altered on Miyota 8series, and you can get it at a reasonable cost.</p>

This is on the grounds that the innovative work expenses of watch developments stay high, requiring modern and costly preparing gear, and considerably more experienced specialized faculty. This is certifiably not a beneficial thing. You know, there are in excess of 200 sections for a development, and each part should be delivered in enormous amounts to decrease the expense. These make it practically unthinkable for us to build up development for a model. This is the reason the plans of watches available are broken. Everybody utilizes a similar development.
The Swiss tackled this issue. Richard Miller, Roger Dubuis, De Bethune, F. P. Journe, Franck Muller, and so on., this arrangement of incredible names speaks to the high degree of the watch business as far as to plan and assembling. They all grow new modules dependent on the ETA development, change the method of perusing, and include new capacities. Make it totally extraordinary. In any case, because of value reasons, the standard will never have one in the course of their life. What a pity!
As an organization with the capacity to create watch developments, we have explained this problem. We started to choose and test the steady and reasonable fundamental mechanical development years prior. As indicated by the plan of the watch, a lot of modules are created on this premise. Much the same as the Swiss Independent watchmaker. Presently, the WINDOWS arrangement is directly before your eyes.ATOWAK will be a really one of a kind encounter for you.

Updated Design




Watch Size


WINDOWS is motivated by the radio. The numbers from 1 to 12 are organized conveniently, much the same as the FM show of a radio. Obviously, in the event that you know about Fiat during the 70s, you may think it originated from Fiat 125. Anyway, it is delightful, you will cherish it and be pulled in by his inventive even time show.



 Time Display The design of the dial adopts a three-layer structure. You can see that the workmanship is excellent.The hour hand proceeds onward the lower layer, and the text style is extraordinarily intended to project 0.3 mm. It's not simply printed. These are strategies for making ""Haute horology"".We planned a lot of apparatuses dependent on the first development to make it travel 36 hours for every unrest. At that point plan a three-arm hour hand, so each hand moves for 12 hours each 120 degrees to show the time.Italian leather is one of the best leather materials in the world. Almost all luxury brands in the world adopt their products. It is soft, comfortable, and fits well on the wrist. The watch case is high quality. The size is 40mm square. Subsequent to wearing it, it looks exceptionally exquisite and unmistakable.

WINDOWS Pro is motivated by the radio as well.
In the event that you are befuddled by the looks and the component of how the watch functions, it is as entrancing as it looks. We have made an extraordinary mechanical development for the watch window to peruse on a level plane rather than the regular exhausting roundabout movement. We intend to bring a high bore watching the market that coordinates the moxy and nature of very good quality programmed watches. The development of the watch is altered on Miyota 8series, and you can get it at a reasonable cost.


From the rear of the watch, you can see the development and ATOWAK's elite Rotor. You can see precisely how the rotor is moving and complicatedly moving the wheel.
The watch dial has a 7-layer structure plan, which is by all accounts taken from a sci-fi film.The sapphire precious stone has been covered with an enemy of intelligent material, which implies you are failing to get a glare out of it. It is scratch-verification, and even hard metals can't make a dent in it.




 
The hour part is intended to be perused on a level plane. The moment is a 120-degree fan, like the Retrograde strategy. The second is a sliding number in a little window. The numbers and tracks are Swiss superluminova to make it simple to peruse the time plainly around evening time.

The case is a sandwich structure with a twofold layer bezel, one is bright aluminum and the other is steel. The bezel is loaded up with vivid Swiss superluminova. It is an uncommon design and stylish watch that you ought to get it.


Swiss superluminova

Individuals with wrist perimeter between 150-230mm are reasonable for wearing this watch. In view of our numerous long stretches of involvement with making watches, this size is reasonable for the vast majority.

</div></div>","It began with a simple idea.
We wanted to remind our loved ones that they are perfect the way they are. We wanted that message to be kept with them at all times and have them be reminded that they are beautiful, lovely..simply perfect.  
The intention was to create something that was affordable by many and had a positive impact on most. Simply engraving a bracelet with beautiful words, sounded rather backwards in this age of wearables but it seemed perfect for this mission. Hence a beautiful bracelet, with a touching message that means, ""You are beautiful just the way you are"" was born. 






We are two designers based in Seoul, South Korea. 
Hyun Kyung, a jewelry designer specializing in metalsmithing and Zuno, a communications designer specializing in copywriting. With this combination it was natural to build a product that told a moving story. 


We wanted to tell people that they are beautiful

Living in a society where appearing beautiful seems to govern many aspects of life, many around us seem to live day to day lives constantly under pressure to look and act more beautiful, forgetting that they actually are.

A simple search online of the word ""beauty"" results in a variety of articles and blog posts on how to become a super star. From simple make up tips to losing weight to even getting extensive plastic surgery, it seems that everyone is preoccupied with the notion of a ""perfect"" appearance without realizing that they already are.
It is true that one of the hardest things is to have the courage and the strength to lovingly but honestly accept yourself. But it is also true that not a lot of resources exist to encourage that people are fine the way they are.


Of all resources, many times, the best ones are just small gestures. A simple pat on the back, a warm smile or just a small hug can tell that person that they are perfect, beautiful, amazing just the way they are.
As a way to portray that message, we wanted to tell people a simple message that they are beautiful..and something more than that. 




We intentionally used Korean 
because of the word ""arum"" which is the main word for the phrase ""넌 있는 그대로가 아름다워."" It roughly translates to beautiful but has a meaning that is slightly different than that. ""arum"" is a Korean word that not only sounds beautiful, but also has the meaning of both inner and outer beauty, all the while including the traits of being lovely, warm hearted, and kind. Most importantly, it focuses on the balance and harmony of being...well, arum. 


We wanted to tell people that not only are they beautiful, but also they are lovely, warm hearted, kind and most importantly harmoniously so.


An Engraved bracelet that can be worn at all times
The bracelet itself is easy, modern, and simple to be worn any time of the day telling you that you are beautiful.
With the engraving on the back of the bracelet, it provides a subtle yet nuanced reminder that ""You are beautiful just the way you are.""






It tells you that you always have been beautiful.


It is not something that will make you more beautiful. Rather, it will let you discover that you already have been. 
We created this bracelet that represents a way of expressing that all individuals are “arum” in their own way. The bracelet reads “넌 있는 그대로가 아름다워” which resonates an underlying message that “You yourself are arum.""
We believe that a subtle reminder is all that you need to bring out that confident smile. And that confident smile is worth much more than anything in the world. A small nuanced gesture - that surprisingly inspires you as you go about your day. Just by glancing at the back of the plate, we want to brighten someone’s day, put a smile on someone's face and most importantly remind them that they are “be.arum.""

We want to be able to make this message affordable to as many people as possible. After careful consideration of materials used, hours of labor, and skills we hope to provide the best options for all. The items include Free international shipping leaving from Seoul, South Korea.

Lowering prices by acquiring bulk deals in purchasing premium materials

Breakdown:  It takes time to make this bracelet. Since everything is handcrafted from the bracelet to the packaging, it is essential to have another set of hands to help us get the message across to as many people as possible.  A bracelet is great, yet there could be more possibilities of weaving this message into other accessories. A necklace would be the next step to match the beautiful bracelet. We want to make this bracelet affordable to most. To do this, we need to cut costs and that is possible through bulk purchasing. At this time we purchase our materials individually per order, if we are able to purchase materials in bulk, the price of the bracelet will become more affordable.

<h2><b><u>Our story</u></b></h2>
<p>Acossi jeans was founded 4 years ago by fashion designer Natacha Lacosse when she began experimenting with denim, paint, rhinestones and other items as a way to escape the often dull and saturated market of jeans and jackets. Through her close research of trade shows, runways, early adapters and street-trends, she began to channel her fresh look to new and exciting designs.

Our story
Acossi jeans was founded 4 years ago by fashion designer Natacha Lacosse when she began experimenting with denim, paint, rhinestones and other items as a way to escape the often dull and saturated market of jeans and jackets. Through her close research of trade shows, runways, early adapters and street-trends, she began to channel her fresh look to new and exciting designs. Starting with jeans and later adding jackets to her line, the internationally contemporary street wear and casual feel began to take hold. From the streets of Paris, to Milan and back to New York City where she currently resides, the mix of grit and elegance has given the brand a look like no other. Which all our denim was sourced by US suppliers personally and visited by the designer.

				Our goal is to bring a trend worthy line of ready-to-wear jeans and jackets while landing them in stores at mid-range price, with an escalating pricing strategy for online retailers and other outlets.





Acossi Jeans has been featured in several fashion events, including Prêt A Porte in Milan, where it first received international recognition. The line has also been featured in the Hong Kong, Shanghai markets and New York City. Also has been sported by TV personality Don Peavy, of the prime time show: Chef Race: U.K. vs. U.S.

</p><p>Hi!
I am Colette Welch, creator and owner of ""SHUNAMI"". Opening my own
store has been my life's dream. Hard work, dedication, and a true passion for
shoes has brought me here. Your contribution will go towards the store
build-out, the fixtures and of course amazing, unique, awesome quality shoes.
My story can best be told through the eyes of my loyal customers and friends. I
would like to share three testimonials with you. My goal is for everyone buying
shoes to walk away with their own ""SHUNAMI"" experience. </p>
<p>Here
are the three testimonials:</p>
<p>""Now
I have purchased shoes elsewhere but, frankly, the shoes I wear most often and
am happiest with are from Colette. Her business acumen, product knowledge and
service keep me a customer. We need a quality shoe store that is not a DSW and
I can only hope and look forward to Colette's continuing on in the spirit""

<p>L.

<p>""I
have been buying shoes from Colette for 20 years because the first time I met
her in Calhoun Square, I knew I was with someone that cared about what I needed
and could intuit what I wanted. She has the ability to get me to try things I
haven't considered because she knows what lifestyle I have and what I will be
happy with in the long run. She also has a deep knowledge of designers and
shoemakers and remembers what I have in my closet. She is bar-none the best,
and my husband, who only shops now and then, remembers every pair of shoes he
has bought from Colette and agrees with me she is the one.""- J. Evans,
Minneapolis, MN</p>
<p>""My
daughters and I like shoes, but even better, we enjoy buying them from Colette.
For the past 20 years, every time that I can remember buying shoes, they were
from Colette. Why? Because the sales person is the soul of the store. Colette
fondly remembers our best purchases. Often we bought the same shoes she was
wearing. There just isn't a price you can put on a personal relationship with
somebody who knows shoes, and knows your taste in shoes. Colette sold us shoes
that spurted flames and heels that said '40's flirt. She sold us amazing boots,
classics that took our daughter to college and me on a book tour. She sold us
shoes that gave us confidence, and UGGS I could schlep these daughters to
school in half-asleep. In short, she helped us get from there to here""

<p></p> <p>Project <i>Light 'Er Up</i> is created to offer extraordinary lighters. The main goal is to bring out Latvian culture &amp; share it worldwide. It's quite a specific design, being as interesting for people around the world, as it is for Latvians. The idea was born in September 2014, and there have been plenty of changes since then. Now, it's official –<i> it has to be a movement</i>. </p>

<p>First, I love the idea of charms that are always by my side, though never found the one I truly cared for. Since I'm passioned about design, too, a thought came into my mind – <b>why not advance the routine &amp; make a revolution?</b></p>
<p>So the crazy sketching period was on.</p>

<p><i><br/></i></p>
<p>Starting from September 2014, there have been several ideas of pursuing the lighters just the right way, that have developed into various beautiful designs, engraved &amp; printed as well. <b>I believe in pure simplicity at all cause, and I represent it within my work.</b></p>

</div></div>","What's This About?
 Project Light 'Er Up is created to offer extraordinary lighters. The main goal is to bring out Latvian culture & share it worldwide. It's quite a specific design, being as interesting for people around the world, as it is for Latvians. The idea was born in September 2014, and there have been plenty of changes since then. Now, it's official – it has to be a movement.

   Creative Process Now how did I get here?
First, I love the idea of charms that are always by my side, though never found the one I truly cared for. Since I'm passioned about design, too, a thought came into my mind – why not advance the routine & make a revolution?
So the crazy sketching period was on.

Starting from September 2014, there have been several ideas of pursuing the lighters just the right way, that have developed into various beautiful designs, engraved & printed as well. I believe in pure simplicity at all cause, and I represent it within my work.





God's sign symbolizes the male power, sky, light and striving upwards. Opening downwards symbolizes movement, volatility and cyclicality. God is benevolent guardian and companion; fair and amiable counselor.




Mara's cross is considered the symbol of fire, it is a sign of happiness and love, which protects them from evil. As Mara was seen as a guardian of the farm, with Mara cross was guarded material well-being - houses and bread - she protected the family's future.


Every lighter contains a part of the culture, in this case it's Latvian historical symbols. Later on, I am planning on building a cultural empire, containing as many nationalities as possible. 


    Funding & Perks The main point of this funding is the actual printing costs, to even make a lighter look as it should. Also, it's about the packaging – a black leather case for every lighter.
Then, I have to keep the online store going, when it comes to hosting & taking care of the daily marketing tasks: ads & seasonal campaigns. Check out the current version and be so kind to let me know what you think: Light 'Er Up





Next, I have to be prepared for worldwide shipping, since I am positioning this as an international project. I have never done anything this huge before.



If a great amount of lighters are needed, there's a special perk for 50 pcs standard or GOLD editions available, saving up to $500.

EXTRA PERK AVAILABLE NOW

If you're interested to help and more enthusiastic about some great wear than lighters, I am glad to announce the first ever Light 'Er Up t–shirt collection. Be the first to receive this 100% cotton shirt & support a revolution!


If the shirts turn out to have a good run, EXCLUSIVE Mara's cross & God's sign designs will be added.
Also, Light 'Er Up have several connections & partnerships pending, including some of the highest ranked gift shops in Riga, and as they have agreed to place the lighters at their stores, I need to produce them as  soon as possible.

Who's Responsible?
My name is Katrina, I'm a 21–year–old, living in Riga, Latvia. I am a Psychology & Criminology student, also passioned about the culture and graphic design.

With creating Light 'Er Up, my aim is to make history interesting, as well as popularize the national traditions. Since I'm trying to make a change, I believe the timing is great, because a project like this has not been made yet.

    Why Light 'Er Up? Light 'Er Up is made to have two great meanings.
First, it has a context of lighting a fire, as it should be. Then, as a reaction, the mood lightens up. Also, it represents the flame, which has to be lit.
Enjoy the twist.

Risks & Challenges
Honestly, the only challenges that could make me worried are some unexpected difficulties packing the lighters up or shipping them out. Hope to get some help from my dearest friends, if the amount of work gets totally out of hand.


Approximate Dates, Details & Events
As I am thinking this through, here's the approximate schedule:
In June, the campaign is running at it's best to gain it's main goal, meanwhile covering the status in the media, as well as promoting the online store & making new connections to even more gift shops around the country.
After finishing the campaign, according to the collected amount of donations & contributions, the manufacturing starts. It takes up to 7 working days to actually produce all of the rewards mentioned above. I intend on shipping the ordered rewards regardless of the total outcome.

Once the lighters are ready, engraved, printed & packed, the shipping is on! The approximate date of sending them out is July 1. The standard shipping cost is already calculated & included when contributing. 

The lighters will take up the gift shops just in time for the summer heat & various festivals. I have reserved spots in different events to promote Light 'Er Up when the campaign is successful and I reach the manufacturing goal.

<p style=""text-align: left;"">After the Daria &amp;
Egor came up with the
idea to create an off-line status bracelet, we realized that a lot needs to be
done. Bringing this idea to life requires a large amount of effort, money and
time in order to place this opportunity in life of at least a part of us. There
are many ways to communicate and find each other online. There are hundreds of
different opportunities online, which are really useful in distance, but completely
useless in real life when people are next to you. What do you do in everyday
life, when you see or meet someone in a cafe, in public transport or at school / university / at work? <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">In fractions of seconds, in
every moment when the person passes by? There is one of the few signs which can help us understand something about the man from the distance – clothes. But at most It helps us understand what time of a year
it is and whether a person has a taste. Yup. </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Yes, of course, we all know about
the engagement ring but there is also a wide range of other, more subtle
circumstances that we live and feel. Because of this, we often miss the
opportunity to date and communicate with people who are studying, working and
are just next to us at this moment. It is not easy to start talking with a
stranger, right? </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">But if this person could show us that he/she is ready to
communicate, and even gave a chance to start the conversation!?</span></p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">We
know how to make communicating and dating easier! We still have a lot of ideas
in this direction, but we want to start it with the bracelets Feelings Bangle.
We have experience in the production and sale of goods in several countries.
But this opportunity to become truly work all over the world, we need You. Each
of You can make this goal closer, and together we will make communicating and
dating of people simpler. We are convinced that collect 15,000 orders is possible.
These funds are needed for the further development and promotion of its ideas
throughout the world. So we need your help – tell about the possibilities
Feelings Bangle on your pages, show bracelet relatives, friends, acquaintances,
colleagues, indicate their status on the photo of your hand. In general, spread

It’s the same as statuses in social networks, but now your status is visible even if you are off-line and anywhere where nobody knows you and haven’t ever seen you social pages. It’s the bracelet with specific catchy form which you can see on the wrist of another person and the color of bracelet makes you understand his status.Sometimes as many, we are faced with difficulties in communicating with people. In social network to address this issue, there are a lot of possibilities. But what can we do if we see a man in a cafe and can’t come up just to say ""Hi"", we don’t know anything about him or her, we are afraid to look awkward in that kind of moments, so.. We decided to make these moments of real life easier, and created Feelings Bangle your off-line status – simple and intuitive way for building of any relationship.
  vkontakte        facebook       twitter

It’s your own sign of feelings and relationships.
We are constantly surrounded by people. Off-line status is one of the
few opportunities to understand the person's mood and relations, even if we see
him for the first time, which makes communication easier and more comfortable.










  

Your status is always visible to everyone & everywhere. 
Your status is always with you in contrast to the statuses in social
networks, which means you have more opportunities to meet someone interesting
in absolutely anywhere.









  

Can be personalized. 
Personalize
status with your trinkets and pendants which   signify
important things in your life. 









    


Gift, friendship suggestion, love confession and much more.
The status can be
presented as a gift, friendship suggestion, love confession and much more.









  

The combination of several statuses.
You can
combine several statuses and their meaning will be much deeper.









    

Glows in the dark.
Bracelet glows in the dark so you will know when
somebody is wearing It at night or in the dark rooms.









  

Easy recognition from afar.
Status meaning are clear from afar by color and
bracelet form, It’s not necessary to read It’s name.









  

Hide It at moment you want.
It’s easy to take It off or hide under sleeve at
any moment.














After the Daria &
Egor came up with the
idea to create an off-line status bracelet, we realized that a lot needs to be
done. Bringing this idea to life requires a large amount of effort, money and
time in order to place this opportunity in life of at least a part of us. There
are many ways to communicate and find each other online. There are hundreds of
different opportunities online, which are really useful in distance, but completely
useless in real life when people are next to you. What do you do in everyday
life, when you see or meet someone in a cafe, in public transport or at school / university / at work? In fractions of seconds, in
every moment when the person passes by? There is one of the few signs which can help us understand something about the man from the distance – clothes. But at most It helps us understand what time of a year
it is and whether a person has a taste. Yup. Yes, of course, we all know about
the engagement ring but there is also a wide range of other, more subtle
circumstances that we live and feel. Because of this, we often miss the
opportunity to date and communicate with people who are studying, working and
are just next to us at this moment. It is not easy to start talking with a
stranger, right? But if this person could show us that he/she is ready to
communicate, and even gave a chance to start the conversation!?




We
know how to make communicating and dating easier! We still have a lot of ideas
in this direction, but we want to start it with the bracelets Feelings Bangle.
We have experience in the production and sale of goods in several countries.
But this opportunity to become truly work all over the world, we need You. Each
of You can make this goal closer, and together we will make communicating and
dating of people simpler. We are convinced that collect 15,000 orders is possible.
These funds are needed for the further development and promotion of its ideas
throughout the world. So we need your help – tell about the possibilities
Feelings Bangle on your pages, show bracelet relatives, friends, acquaintances,
colleagues, indicate their status on the photo of your hand. In general, spread
the news in any possible way you want. Thank you for your support!

too uncomfortable or didn’t stay in place.

</div></div>","Imagine
you’re working out or running errands on the weekend.  You catch a glimpse of yourself in the mirror
or even worse, someone else staring at your chest as you realize your
headlights are on high beam!  *sigh  
Hi my name is Jaime – wife, mom, banker by day and entrepreneur ‘round the clock. Simply stated – nipples happen AND they happened to
me!  I’ve tried every option I could to keep these unruly beasts at
bay.  Band-Aids, doubled up on sports
bras, regular bras under sports bras, petals and even the dreadful chicken
cutlet.  All of these options were either
too uncomfortable or didn’t stay in place. 

I finally purchased an expensive name brand, padded sports
bra.  But after several washes, the pads
disintegrated and I was left with yet another sports bra that I added to the
pile of misfits, permanently glued to the bottom of my drawer.We've developed the NoNips product, so that women of all
ages, sizes and shapes can have a product they can use to confidently conceal their
headlights, boob sweat and all the fun things that come with being a lady.NoNips Were Designed by Women, for WomenMachine Washable?  Why yes! I'll take it.  Each pair of NoNips is packaged in a mesh bag.  That way, when you go to wash them, they won't get lost like a pair of socks. Seriously, does anyone else have an alien in their laundry room?We mentioned above the background on Polartec Fabrics ... bi-component awesomeness means you don't have to wash your NoNips with each wear.  After wearing, place your NoNips on a flat surface to air dry.  Then when you're ready to wash them, simply place your NoNips in the mesh bag, toss into the wash with like colors. Once the wash is complete, remove and place NoNips onto a flat surface to air dry.  It's that easy!We've received a
ton of support getting our product this far and we are ready to take it to the
next level.         I recently had breast augmentation and wore my NoNips to the gym
for the first time. Ladies - these are my new best friend. They give me a nice
shape, hid my nipples (which have been erect since surgery) and never moved
once, while I exercised. Also, they were very comfortable against my
incisions/scars. NoNips are a great investment! I find that I’m wearing them
every day, everywhere! Thank you Jaime for this awesome product!!!!        Jacquie L. Gilbert,
AZ
I absolutely LOVE NoNips. As an athlete I always spend my time
in sports bras and I've always had a problem with my headlights showing
through. I couldn't even wear the Nike sports bras we received this year for
softball because it bothered me so much. NoNips wash up great and are super
comfortable and sturdy. Ever since I started wearing NoNips I have been wearing
my sports bra and I feel more confident in myself. Thank you NoNips for
allowing me be able to wear sports bra confidently.

As a female in law
enforcement, I’m thankful to have stumbled upon your product.  I struggled every day with the headlight

vests when they enter their building. 
Now imagine the embarrassment they face when they’re with a detainee
and they have to remove their vest.  I had no idea that these agents wore sports bras under their vests until
I received a recent testimonial. 
Unfortunately a lot of women opt out of the sports bra for this very same
problem!  NoNips is honored to be their
ride along.  #braveWe welcome YOU to be a part of our team!The Classy Girl Founding Family (CGFF) is a special group consisting of those that pledged at least $5 bucks to our Indiegogo campaign.  We will not host this offer ever again.

Risks and Challenges - update
We've done our homework, so the risks are very minimal. We have manufacturing secured and will be able to ship within 45 days of successful project funding. Yeay!

Sexual Nature of the Topic: It's 2015 and there are still a lot of people out there that are freaked out with the thought of nipples, let alone feel comfortable talking about them. Instead of hiding from the problem we're facing it head on by creating only tasteful marketing campaigns and adding just the right amount of humor, when appropriate. When done tastefully, we will bring the right kind of attention to the problem and highlight our classiest of solutions.

<h3><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></h3>
<p><b>1. What size should I get?</b></p>
<p>Our size has been matched with US size, so for anyone in Asia we would recommend to choose one size lower than your usual (if you buy M in Asia, you should get S). </p>
<p><strong>2. Where do you ship and how much will shipping cost?</strong></p>
<p>We ship globally! That means you can order DryWeave from wherever you are. Shipping to all countries other than Indonesia will have a flat rate of $12 (per perk). For those residing in Indonesia, shipping is free.</p>
<p><strong>3. How come it takes so long to make?</strong></p>
<p>We've custom ordered our fabric which means that the textile supplier will have to create them from scratch. Textile production will take roughly two months to make and then we proceed to shirt production which will take about one month before we ship them to you. </p>
<p><strong>4. What if I want to change my order?</strong></p>
<p>We will send a follow up survey for you to reconfirm your order or if you want to add more items.</p>

give you brains & beauty by integrating smart Power and a Wireless Hard Drive
into elegant and functional lifestyle backpacks.  With COALITION backpacks you can charge all
of your USB devices, access files, back up your photos, or watch movies - no
matter where you are.  Choose your pack,
and customize the technology to suit your needs.We've been in the business of designing and manufacturing packs for over 6 years. We are the only proven Smartpacks on the market.  Our production is done and we're ready to ship as soon as the campaign ends, if we reach our entire goal or not!

The
Federal is the most stylish and functional everyday backpack you’ll own.
Form and function come together to bring you a lifestyle backpack unlike
anything you’ve ever experienced. Its simple, clean design is timeless and
modern enough to work well with business attire just as well as it does with
casual street wear.

The
Colfax is your tackle-everything, go-to-bag. Not too large, not too small -
it's just right. Works great as an everyday commuter backpack, but equally as

pack.

WHERE.
Anywhere...
WHY
it's important and why we're different than other ""smart"" bags...
Bag
design, aesthetic and function matter!
Wearable
tech is exploding, what's lacking is good bag design WITH smart technology.
It’s time for backpacks to join the movement for the first time in style.
We’re on a mission to accelerate adoption and make sure it’s done right –
Keeping people connected on-the-go with great looking bag design. The
aesthetic and function of the bag itself cannot be overshadowed by the
tech. This is a new, emerging market so join our COALITION.
WHEN
can we deliver?... NOW! Shipping
starts immediately after this campaign ends
We
are the ONLY proven and established pack brand in the Smartpack arena.  We have already shown quick delivery of the
product we promise.  Other
companies making ""smart"" bags have not, or will not deliver for
months, and their product has not been tested in the hands of the consumer.  We have already made and shipped an entire
production, proven our product on the market, and are here to provide you with
a fully functional product as soon as the campaign ends. We've been in the business
of designing and manufacturing packs for over 6 years. We have well established
manufacturing partnerships, a dialed supply chain, award-winning products and
expertise in the carry industry. Put your trust in the only REAL Smartpack
brand.
WHO we are...






What
We Need 
We've
already paid for the majority of our production but we need your help for the final push to pay our suppliers in full.  Funds will also be used to improve our website for better user experience and consumer education.  We're looking to raise $20,000 and it will be allocated as shown below:

$12,000 will pay off remaining cost of production


$8,000 for updated website for experience and consumer education


If we don't reach our entire goal, the funds will first go towards paying
production costs. If we get funded more than our original goal, the money will
go directly back into the company to cover future manufacturing costs and the
development of new products
What
You Get
We've
already completed production. You get the instant gratification of getting your
pack immediately after the campaign ends - no matter if we reach our entire goal or not.  You'll get your pack at a special
pre-sale price that will be gone after this campaign.
We
are a reputable company with many an established manufacturing/supply chain,
and years of expertise to deliver quality products that will exceed your
expectations for years to come!

The warm LED lights offer just enough light to keep a low-light plant growing, or supplement natural light for other types of plantings. They cast really amazing ambient light for a modern home.

And for those in the Portland area, we can arrange a 1-2 night stay for you and your family in the space (I’ll just go camping for the night!).Green Thumb: Lastly, I have a couple of remaining furniture pieces from the design and fabrication shop I ran for many years. These include the last two “Hanging Garden Lamps” which are carefully crafted LED lamps that illuminate a resin lined planting area. One is built from reclaimed Teak and the other from Oak and framed in blackened steel. The warm LED lights offer just enough light to keep a low-light plant growing, or supplement natural light for other types of plantings. They cast really amazing ambient light for a modern home. Can be put on a surface or suspended from attachment points at either end. You can learn more about the available lamps HERE.More About AcornIt's exciting to for me to finally build something for myself! Luckily, I have been collecting materials for this project for months now! Some of the highlights of the planned design include:
All Cedar Exterior, natural finishes
Salvaged Butternut Countertop w/ Walnut Kitchen Sink
Salvaged Cedar Lined Shower and Toilet Room w/ Composting Toilet
Birch Plywood Interior Features
Whitewashed Walls (Light, Airy Aesthetic)
Salvaged, Original Trailer Windows and Door Frame
Salvaged Fresh and Grey Water Tanks
Solar System and Battery Bank for Off-Grid Living
High Efficiency Systems: LP Gas Heat and Cooking, LED Lighting
Fully Designed Interior, Down to the Square Inch, for Storage/Space Efficiency
Integrated Cat LItter Box Area and Cat Door (obviously)
Integrated Planter for Indoor Plants
Challenges and Other Ways You Can HelpThis project is being primarily constructed by myself, with some key help along the way. My main challenge right now is funding the critical upcoming, expensive components (insulation, systems components, solar setup). But also finding physical help! I am actively looking for volunteers on Craigslist and through word of mouth. An extra set of hands makes building things easier, and another human around makes the project fun! So if you’re in the Greenville area, and you have time on your hands, let me know!Of course, every enthusiast who really reads through all this knows that the power of crowdfunding is in reaching the biggest crowd! Please, share this project with folks! Share on Facebook and Twitter! Check out the #AcornTrailer hashtag on Instagram. And Email me if you want to ask a question.Let’s make this Acorn sprout!",10.0,0,"1 Campaign

        passion alive when you can't see your man as much as you'd like. Many
        people believe that long distance relationships are never going to work
        out. Your family may discourage it, and some of your best friends may
        advise you not to take it too seriously, in case you get your heart
        broken. With an unprecedented number of dual-career couples in the
        modern world, being near the one you love is no longer always a
        guarantee. Long-distance relationships (LDR) are proliferating, with an
        estimated 14 million couples defining their relationships as such and a
        staggering 75 percent of engaged couples reporting having been in a
        long distance relationship at some point.</p>

<h3>Rowan Bay</h3>
<p>Hello, I am Larissa and I'm the owner, and creator at Rowan Bay, as well as an ecologist and wildlife gardener, and a mother to two. Rowan Bay was a natural fusion of all my passions and hobbies - combining my creative interests with my love of nature whilst sharing something which enabled a closer bond with both my children. <br/><br/>I have set up Rowan Bay alongside my day job as an ecologist, creating all the designs myself and working closely with a British textile mill to have the first batch of tester wraps woven. These are currently carrying babies, toddlers and even bigger kids around the UK and Europe. <br/><br/>The first creation which is currently being tested is a 350gsm double-weave Egyptian combed cotton wrap. With a high gsm it is relatively thick, yet  the combed cotton means it is soft to touch, even straight off the loom, and will only get softer - think marshmallows and fluffy pillows. This double-weave blend is a good all rounder wrap, which has proven it's strength and has cush for days. Whilst perhaps not the ideal wrap for a newborn, if your child is a larger baby to a pre-schooler, this blend is for you. This blend has been woven in two tester designs; Chrysler, a geometric pattern of chevrons, and Sorbus; a more natural design comprising of a repeated pattern of three rowan leaves. This blend is being woven in the Chrysler pattern as we speak, and there are exciting things happening for the Sorbus design.<br/><br/><br/><strong>Acknowledgements</strong>  <br/>I would like to say thank you to the following people who have helped me get this far (in no particular order); Ross, Mum &amp; Dad, Maureen, Kate and Dave, Nicola, Natalie, Rachel, Katy, Ellie, Jill, Jo, Nikki, Caroline, Rosanna and of course, Fox &amp; Lily. </p>

<p>At Vorque, we believe in functionality, quality and value in our watches and that everyone should own a living, beating timepiece that is both beautiful and dependable. All our movements are sourced directly from Switzerland and
encased in modern day designs that blends a little bit of tradition. The subtle
modifications ensures that our watches evolves while preserving an old,
charismatic charm. </p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1448939879/v4e0pemdo15r937wckmr.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/>
<p>We believe that a watch is never
just a timekeeper, but also a companion steeped in beautiful memories as it accompanies
you on your everyday journey. </p><p></p>
<p>During the course of the
design stage, Vorque made the choice of using the Swiss-Made ETA 2824-2  instead of the Japanese-Made Miyota 9015 as it is a quality proven workhorse
for decades. We want our backers to receive a watch that is durable and works
reliably as we believe that a timepiece is like a long lasting companion.  Vorque Watches would be available at a very
competitive value for it’s specs ( – one of the brand’s vision ) when compared
to other micro brands as well as similar ETA 2824 powered watches. </p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1446356450/tvmilsqtddm6ce2qhtdd.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 620px;height: 413px;""/></p>Over the past one year, we’ve been working on
the design and prototyping of our first watch, the Constantine. But we’ve reached
a stage that we cannot continue our journey without your backings: mass
production. The production minimum order quantity of 300 watches resulted to a
funding goal of $75,000. <div>

</p>
<p>The campaign would run from November 28th till December 18th. You can have the opportunity to own the Constantine for the value of $429 to $479. There would not be stretch goals as we believe that our backers should receive the best possible version of the Constantine irregardless of the amount funded. </p>
<p>Lastly, we do hope to receive
your backing for a final push towards production for the Constantine and plans are also in place for our 2<sup>nd</sup> collection but it would not be possible without your backing.  We are
in for the long run and would with no doubt come back with another exciting
watch. but first, we would need your full support for our first model.</p>
<h4>Part 2 – 'Constantine'</h4>
<p>The Constantine features a a robust
Swiss Made ETA 2824-2 automatic movement housed in a 40mm case along with a beautiful guilloche dial and it is designed with the idea for the watch to look both elegant and well proportioned. </p>

<h3><b>The dial </b></h3>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">The waffle patterned dial
is a very classic and practical design and it expresses itself subtlely and
offer different shades when positioned at different angles. It gives the watch a  mid century vibe and very much like the classic dress watches from the 50s.   The details of the dial grows on you over time and you would slowly appreciate it. Along with the applied hour indices, it creates depth when you look at the watch in different lighting conditions. </span></p>

<p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">A 2 mm thick sapphire crystal with underside AR (Anti-Reflective) coating protects the Constantine's dial. Sapphire is the obvious choice for the watch crystal instead of Mineral as it offers superior scratch resistance and clarity. The sapphire crystal reduces optical distortion and maintains legibility even at extreme angles. The AR coating enhances the Constantine's legibility in intense lighting environments that might produce reflections. </span></p>

<h3><b>The movement</b></h3>
<p>A quality automatic watch can work for decades
with regular servicing and unlike quartz movements, it does not need any
battery change.  All it requires is a good wind and it is set to go. That
is why our movement of choice would be the highly revered ETA 2824-2. The no nonsense movement is known for its reliability and consistency have been used by many major Swiss watch houses such as Omega, IWC and Brietling. With regular servicing, it should last a lifetime due to its robust construction and manufacturing quality. </p>
<h3><b>Why Swiss and not Japanese?</b></h3>
</div>
<div>Many Microbrand watches uses Miyotas and Seiko movements. They are pretty solid movements in their own right but the 2824-2 is a proven
workhorse since its first variant was introduced in the sixties. We want ensured quality for our timepieces and for them last for a long to come without any major problems. The
2824-2 is also more easily serviced as most watch technicians are familiar with
the movement itself and parts are more readily available as well. With that in mind, the pricing of our watches are not much higher than those with Miyotas and are also considerably lower than most 2824-2 powered watches because we strive to provide solid and yet at the same time, affordable watches. </div>

<p>The short film by Vorque depicts
a beautiful story that shows how the same watch bonds father and son. </p>
<p>The film starts off with the
son reminiscing the journey that he went through together with the watch that
was given by his father. The watch has always been there with him throughout
and when he achieved what he had set out for, he went back to where it all
started.  What this shows is that the father
would always be a constant part of the watch that the son would always have;
just like a companion</p>

</div></div>","Constantine’ by Vorque – Swiss
Automatic Movement Watch

The 'Constantine' is the first collection of timepieces from Vorque Watches. The collection is also featured on the following sites: http://wornandwound.com/2015/12/02/vorque-constantine-review/http://wristreview.com/?p=19189http://www.watchpaper.com/2015/11/07/vorque-constantine-hands-on-preview/""When it comes to to automatic movements, usually, microbrands prefer Japanese movements — Miyota or Seiko. For the Constantine, Vorque preferred to go with a Swiss ETA 2824-2, which I find surprising considering the pre-order price of the watch."" - Watchpaper""To sum it all up, the Constantine is a handsome watch and a value for money that is more than capable of exceeding your expectations when it comes to design and build quality."" - WristReview""This vintage styled dial is simple, elegant and features a gorgeous texture that covers it entirely. Coming out of the slightly pearlescent surface are tiny pyramids, each catching the light, and casting little shadows (it’s called Clous de Paris). The result is nothing short of beautiful. It brings to mind waffles dials of watches from the 50’s, ..."" - Worn&WoundPart 1 – About Us
At Vorque, we believe in functionality, quality and value in our watches and that everyone should own a living, beating timepiece that is both beautiful and dependable. All our movements are sourced directly from Switzerland and
encased in modern day designs that blends a little bit of tradition. The subtle
modifications ensures that our watches evolves while preserving an old,
charismatic charm. 
We believe that a watch is never
just a timekeeper, but also a companion steeped in beautiful memories as it accompanies
you on your everyday journey. 
During the course of the
design stage, Vorque made the choice of using the Swiss-Made ETA 2824-2  instead of the Japanese-Made Miyota 9015 as it is a quality proven workhorse
for decades. We want our backers to receive a watch that is durable and works
reliably as we believe that a timepiece is like a long lasting companion.  Vorque Watches would be available at a very
competitive value for it’s specs ( – one of the brand’s vision ) when compared
to other micro brands as well as similar ETA 2824 powered watches. Over the past one year, we’ve been working on
the design and prototyping of our first watch, the Constantine. But we’ve reached
a stage that we cannot continue our journey without your backings: mass
production. The production minimum order quantity of 300 watches resulted to a
funding goal of $75,000. 





The campaign would run from November 28th till December 18th. You can have the opportunity to own the Constantine for the value of $429 to $479. There would not be stretch goals as we believe that our backers should receive the best possible version of the Constantine irregardless of the amount funded. 
Lastly, we do hope to receive
your backing for a final push towards production for the Constantine and plans are also in place for our 2nd collection but it would not be possible without your backing.  We are
in for the long run and would with no doubt come back with another exciting
watch. but first, we would need your full support for our first model.
Part 2 – 'Constantine'
The Constantine features a a robust
Swiss Made ETA 2824-2 automatic movement housed in a 40mm case along with a beautiful guilloche dial and it is designed with the idea for the watch to look both elegant and well proportioned. 



The dial 
The waffle patterned dial
is a very classic and practical design and it expresses itself subtlely and
offer different shades when positioned at different angles. It gives the watch a  mid century vibe and very much like the classic dress watches from the 50s.   The details of the dial grows on you over time and you would slowly appreciate it. Along with the applied hour indices, it creates depth when you look at the watch in different lighting conditions. 



A 2 mm thick sapphire crystal with underside AR (Anti-Reflective) coating protects the Constantine's dial. Sapphire is the obvious choice for the watch crystal instead of Mineral as it offers superior scratch resistance and clarity. The sapphire crystal reduces optical distortion and maintains legibility even at extreme angles. The AR coating enhances the Constantine's legibility in intense lighting environments that might produce reflections. 



The movement
A quality automatic watch can work for decades
with regular servicing and unlike quartz movements, it does not need any
battery change.  All it requires is a good wind and it is set to go. That
is why our movement of choice would be the highly revered ETA 2824-2. The no nonsense movement is known for its reliability and consistency have been used by many major Swiss watch houses such as Omega, IWC and Brietling. With regular servicing, it should last a lifetime due to its robust construction and manufacturing quality. 
Why Swiss and not Japanese?

Many Microbrand watches uses Miyotas and Seiko movements. They are pretty solid movements in their own right but the 2824-2 is a proven
workhorse since its first variant was introduced in the sixties. We want ensured quality for our timepieces and for them last for a long to come without any major problems. The
2824-2 is also more easily serviced as most watch technicians are familiar with
the movement itself and parts are more readily available as well. With that in mind, the pricing of our watches are not much higher than those with Miyotas and are also considerably lower than most 2824-2 powered watches because we strive to provide solid and yet at the same time, affordable watches. 






The 2824-2 is a self winding movement
with 38 hours of power reserve, hacking feature, 4 Hz operating
frequency, 25 Jewels and ETACHRON regulator system. 


The elegant butterfly clasp allows the watch to be worn on more conveniently and also ensures that it fits seamlessly and comfortably on
the wrist.









About the film






The short film by Vorque depicts
a beautiful story that shows how the same watch bonds father and son. 
The film starts off with the
son reminiscing the journey that he went through together with the watch that
was given by his father. The watch has always been there with him throughout
and when he achieved what he had set out for, he went back to where it all
started.  What this shows is that the father
would always be a constant part of the watch that the son would always have;
just like a companion

<p>Currently, the Perfect Clutch is available in two colors; soft black leather and red-orange leather grain. The clutch is made from genuine leather and features a removable cross body chain strap. Inside, the wallet stores up to five cards, an elastic band secures a standard sized lipstick and the leather magnetic cell phone case makes answering calls on the go a breeze. </p>

Currently, the Perfect Clutch is available in two colors; soft black leather and red-orange leather grain. The clutch is made from genuine leather and features a removable cross body chain strap. Inside, the wallet stores up to five cards, an elastic band secures a standard sized lipstick and the leather magnetic cell phone case makes answering calls on the go a breeze. 


With Your Support
We will take the chic design of The Perfect Clutch to the next level. 
Our goal is to raise capital to: 

Manufacture The Perfect Clutch for a number of smart phones models on the market. 
Include an array of colors for our customers.
Allow customization; from mix-and-match straps to monogram initials. 

NEW COLOR ALERT! 
We're going nude!
Donate $250 or more towards our goal and be the first to own The Perfect Clutch in black, blood orange or blush! 

In the future we foresee items beyond The Perfect Clutch. As White Flag grows, we want to become a lifestyle brand that empowers. Slogan tees, baseball caps and journals are just a few items that we visualize. 

Our accessories will be a reminder of what one can accomplish if you ""Surrender to your Passions"". 
With your support we can continue the journey.


 



 


 
Risks & Challenges



We currently have a magnetic cell phone case available for iPhone 6, iPhone 6S, Samsung Galaxy 6S and Samsung Galaxy 6S Edge. The mobile industry is producing new smart phone models at a rapid rate and they are introduced to the public at an unwavering speed.
The biggest challenge is keeping up with the changes. With your help, we will not only keep up but stay ahead.

Spread The Word
If you can't contribute, please spread the word. Your enthusiasm has already helped so much! We appreciate you telling people how much you love The Perfect Clutch.",5.0,3,"1 Campaign

<h3>
<br/>Inspiration for POMM™</h3>
<p>Hello, My name is Maryann Kilgallon and I need YOUR help today. I have created &amp; designed the POMM™ device after hearing the tragic story of a little boy who died in my town after being forgotten in a daycare van. After hearing the terrible details of his death, I became very upset and went to bed in tears. I was moved beyond upset and decided right their and then that I had to do something &amp; take action to get involved to help stop this from continuing.</p>
<p>That very night I created the POMM™ device and the next day I started doing research and was stunned at the 600 thousand annual cases of child abuse &amp; neglect by daycare centers &amp; babysitters in the US alone. Also, the statistics are shocking that a child dies every 9 days from vehicle heatstroke death from being left in a vehicle. I have chosen to leave my current position in order to work full time on this life saving device and have joined a University business incubator program for mentorship, guidance and real world training to commercialize the POMM™ and make it a reality. We have an amazing talented team working very hard to bring the POMM™ device to market.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need </h3>
<p>ANY DONATION AMOUNT IS ACCEPTED, I cannot do this alone and need the help of caring people who want to also make a difference. We have started the sourcing all the prototype components and have started on the mobile app. designs &amp; layout. We need additional capital to complete the prototype &amp; mobile  app. We have been accepted to exhibit at CES2019 in Eureka Park to launch POMM™ to the world and plan to secure strategic partnerships to take this device Global. </p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
</div><div><p>With your purchase or donation, you can be a part of something Big and know that you contributed to a great cause. There is no price tag on a precious life of  a child. Your gift is so very much appreciated and needed. Imagine having your name on our corporate headquarters where everyone can see the true backers who believed early on. Thank you for believing with us that 1 person can make a difference and we are united in the care of our future generation.</p></div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>We realized early on that we were undertaking a big challenge in order to make the POMM™ small and comfortable for little wrist. It has been very challenging finding the best, available &amp; smallest parts &amp; sensors. Our engineers have sourced the world for the best technology components and we feel confidant that we are ready to finalize the POMM™ device for production.</p>
</div><div>

<p>Hi I’m Elyse, and I’m starting my own clothing line called BLINK. Blink clothing has a streetwear style with a variety of long and short t-shirts, hoodies, and embroidered hats. You can check out the different clothing designs at, <a href=""http://www.blinkstreetwear.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.blinkstreetwear.com</a>. As I start to get more funding for my business I want to feature more accessories in the Blink brand. </p>
<p>I started this business based off my passion for fashion. Check my twitter bio: “ain’t trashing cause fashion is my passion”.  Anyways… I thought starting my own clothing line would be a lot of fun. I love all things artistic. I paint, draw, do photography, videography and I have experience with graphic design. I’m always wanting to express my artistic ideas through new mediums and clothing would make for a fresh new start. </p>
<p>I’ve made several designs for Blink clothing but I need some help financially so I can successfully launch this business. This business is truly my passion and it would mean a lot to me if I could get a little help. Others who can’t contribute financially can help to support me by sharing word about Blink and sharing the link to my Indiegogo Campaign. </p>
<p>The name Blink was chosen for more than just being a cool name for a clothing line.<br/>I wanted the name of this business to have deeper meaning. I wanted it to relate directly to my life which is synonymous with my faith. I am a Christian and the name Blink reminds me of how those I trust can drop me IN THE BLINK OF AN EYE. It also reminds me of how I can be restored by Jesus IN THE BLINK OF AN EYE. With Blink clothing you can relate the phrase, IN THE  BLINK OF AN EYE with anything you may feel (IN THE BLINK OF AN EYE… lost, found, forgotten, loved). This is why IN THE BLINK OF EYE is gonna be featured throughout different items of clothing in the collection. </p>
<p>I want to say thank you to all who choose to support me. I will definitely make this worthwhile. </p>

<ul> <li>
<p></p>
<div>We Are Indigo's New Kingdom but more importantly, we are you. <p></p>
</div>
<p></p>
<div>Helping artist everywhere, locally &amp; worldwide get exposure while do what they love.<p></p>
</div>
<p></p>
<div>the money that we raise from selling *INK* is to help the artist's get the exposure and make a living.<p></p>
</div>
<p></p>
<div>While using the rest of the money made to build self sustaining green houses,schools, jobs and health facility all around the world and more. We are a Clothing line/Non-Profit.<p></p>
</div>
<p></p>
<div>The saying ""starving artist"" is a phase we are putting a end to, with your help.<p></p>
</div>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<div>Let me tell you a story..<p></p>
</div>
<p></p>
<div>Through out history, we have seen artist go unnoticed or not given the full credit due.<p></p>
</div>
<p></p>
<div>You have all met an artist or one yourself that is struggling to follow their dreams, even with an degree.<p></p>
</div>
<p></p>
<div>Just like you, we have always wanted to find a way to help, make a difference in the world.<p></p>
</div>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<div>Then one day, while looking at my mothers paintings, it hit me. I will not only help my mother make her dream become reality, but I will help everyone do the same. I will make this happen with this a revolutionary clothing line, a Movement where we are all helping do this together. Everyone; and most importantly, YOU! <p></p>
</div>
<p></p>
<div>I thought, why haven't anyone done this before or why not? But I decided to use my entire savings to start this Movement to help everyone, just like you. <p></p>
</div>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<div>Now only a short month later, We have helped artist around the world from many places in the U.S to England, Australia with many more to come. <p></p>
</div>
<p></p>
<div>Now we have expanded our goal/dream on what we aim to achieve with your help.<p></p>
</div>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<div> ""One person can change the world, but everyone should try too ""JFK. <p></p>
</div>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<div>You can help us see this become reality. <p></p>
</div>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<div>I'm sure like everyone you are pressed for time, or want more of it, right? Who doesn't? I can't remember the last person to say ""I wish I had less time or have done less in my life"" while on their deathbed. So will this be one of the things/times you look back on regretting not being evolved in? or are you going to be creating history!<p></p>
</div>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<div>Imagine this,<p></p>
</div>
<p></p>
<div>Seeing your artwork, your creations, being the messages we share with our clothing. Instead of being a 'walking billboard', we can inspire those in the community with art and creations from the community. By being apart of this movement, you are not only gaining a sense of unity locally, but also globally. This movement is really something bigger than ourselves, this is the beginning of the Golden Age, connecting the Global creations to share with our universal family, that is what we all want anyways. Together, we are helping the ones we love and our future, for us and our kids, and their kids to come. <p></p>
</div>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<div>So better yet,<p></p>
</div>
<p></p>

Helping artist everywhere, locally & worldwide get exposure while do what they love.


the money that we raise from selling *INK* is to help the artist's get the exposure and make a living.


While using the rest of the money made to build self sustaining green houses,schools, jobs and health facility all around the world and more. We are a Clothing line/Non-Profit.


The saying ""starving artist"" is a phase we are putting a end to, with your help.



Let me tell you a story..


Through out history, we have seen artist go unnoticed or not given the full credit due.


You have all met an artist or one yourself that is struggling to follow their dreams, even with an degree.


Just like you, we have always wanted to find a way to help, make a difference in the world.



Then one day, while looking at my mothers paintings, it hit me. I will not only help my mother make her dream become reality, but I will help everyone do the same. I will make this happen with this a revolutionary clothing line, a Movement where we are all helping do this together. Everyone; and most importantly, YOU! 


I thought, why haven't anyone done this before or why not? But I decided to use my entire savings to start this Movement to help everyone, just like you. 



Now only a short month later, We have helped artist around the world from many places in the U.S to England, Australia with many more to come. 


Now we have expanded our goal/dream on what we aim to achieve with your help.



 ""One person can change the world, but everyone should try too ""JFK. 



You can help us see this become reality. 



I'm sure like everyone you are pressed for time, or want more of it, right? Who doesn't? I can't remember the last person to say ""I wish I had less time or have done less in my life"" while on their deathbed. So will this be one of the things/times you look back on regretting not being evolved in? or are you going to be creating history!



Imagine this,


Seeing your artwork, your creations, being the messages we share with our clothing. Instead of being a 'walking billboard', we can inspire those in the community with art and creations from the community. By being apart of this movement, you are not only gaining a sense of unity locally, but also globally. This movement is really something bigger than ourselves, this is the beginning of the Golden Age, connecting the Global creations to share with our universal family, that is what we all want anyways. Together, we are helping the ones we love and our future, for us and our kids, and their kids to come. 




So better yet,


Now you are able to make a passive income from anywhere in the world. You are continuing or starting to follow your dreams, while helping someone else do theirs. You now have extra money for bills, living a more free lifestyle the way you want it. Knowing that you have helped make a difference in the world, you feel better about who you are. You are in an interactive global group that shows support help raise fundraisers and other charities for other world changing ideas. 



But wait it gets even better.


With all of the progress we have done together, we cam now start creating hospitals, large self sustaining green houses, schools, jobs, housing and other resources for countries and places that need it.  While helping one person, it helps everyone. We are in this together. You and anyone can do anything you put your mind to, never let someone tell you different.

<p>We aim at helping people improve their
lifestyle. We want to create a healthful working culture. Many urban people
spend a lot of time in the office and have less time for taking care of
themselves. They often struggle with sleepiness, drowsiness, and fatigue in
working and leisure hours. Some people also suffer from insomnia and other
stress-related symptoms. Even worse, some workaholics scarcely leave the
office. With UrbanFit, let’s go outside, take a walk and get some
fresh air. It’s time to truly take care of you and your friends.</p>

is an activity tracker for urban people. Compared to the other rubberish fitness trackers, UrbanFit is a unique simple design. It matches with your city-life
outfits such as shirts, blazers, shoes, and bags.UrbanFit takes care of not only the fashion
issue, but also durability. No one wants to waste money for wearable devices
than only last a few months. As you may realize, many fitness trackers are made out
of plastics. UrbanFit is made out of
the durable and allergy-free materials: Titanium and Sapphire. Our team, with the help of selected
experts, created the simple and durable smart band for the urban people. It’s
UrbanFit.COMPETITORSThe key question our team had in the beginning was, “are there any fitness trackers for formal dress?” This question became “why do they all look so ugly?” We have been using various smart watches and fitness trackers. One day, we had a formal meeting with clients and noticed that the fitness trackers we had was not matching with our formal outfits. This question was the very beginning of the concept underlying the project.Later, we carefully researched the fitness tracker market and figured out there are no good looking fitness trackers in the market. Also, we realized many people don’t buy trackers because of their poor aesthetic qualities.STRAPSUrbanFit is available in polyurethane straps (black) and leather straps (black, tan, and burgundy). After placing your order, please send us your selection via e-mail.

UrbanFit is simple. It combines your
bio-signal data and simplifies them into one significant scale. Now, you don’t
need to be inundated with meaningless information of your body. UrbanFit
focuses on Active Energy.


Active Energy is a systematic estimate of how
long you are awake, how much you sleep, how many steps you walk, how fast your
heart beats, and how much energy you consume.




To accomplish this, the device periodically
captures and measures your walking steps, heart rates, sleeping patterns, and
burned calories. Based on the data, the UrbanFit application tells you how much

AVATAR

UrbanFit is the world’s first wearable device
with the bio-signal synced avatar technology. Utilizing the tured signals of
your body, an avatar represents your health status with various gestures.



When you are energetic, your avatar turns to
the “happy mode.” If you didn’t get much of sleep, your avatar turns to the
“tired mode.” Instead of reading numbers, charts and graphs, you can easily

it. You touch it. You feel it every time. UrbanFit is made out of titanium. Titanium is strong, durable, and perfect for human skin. It is known as the best allergy-free
material. It has been used for artificial body parts and joints. We believe
titanium will open a new era of wearable devices.

FOR THE BETTER LIFESTYLE


We aim at helping people improve their
lifestyle. We want to create a healthful working culture. Many urban people
spend a lot of time in the office and have less time for taking care of
themselves. They often struggle with sleepiness, drowsiness, and fatigue in
working and leisure hours. Some people also suffer from insomnia and other
stress-related symptoms. Even worse, some workaholics scarcely leave the
office. With UrbanFit, let’s go outside, take a walk and get some
fresh air. It’s time to truly take care of you and your friends.

<h3>Why do you need an RFID Passport case ?</h3>
<p>RFID technology ( Radio Frequency Identification ) is already being used in numerous consumer products and is constantly expanding. With well over 200 million credit and debit cards, millions of hotel room keys, all US Passports issued since October 2006, a growing number of state driver’s licenses, work IDs and even transit cards all using RFID chips, more personal information is at risk than ever before. These chips contain first page passport information including your photo. The special driver’s licenses from New York, Michigan, Washington, Vermont are “enhanced” with long-range RFID chips. Overall, enough data that identity theft is an ongoing threat for owners of RFID enabled products.</p>

<p><strong>We are a product design studio</strong> devoted to design for every day life. </p>
<p>3 years ago, we came together aiming to change daily life somewhat with small idea or simple design. One day, when talking about plants, we realized that's the opportunity we were pursuing. We enjoy the ""untouchable outdoors"". However,  our plants keep dying due to over watering or under watering. And the traditional &amp; monotonous pots are also frustrating.

<h2>OUR JOURNEY</h2>
<p>In past 3 years, we kept fine tuning design, hunting for quality &amp; eco friendly materials, &amp; pursuing excellence in production process. Today, we have developed 5 types of planters. <strong>Overflow is our favorite and ready for production. </strong></p>

</div></div><h3>OUR STORY:  Over the years, we have had many sizes and different breeds of dogs in our lives.  Back in 2003, Jim and I became involved in rescuing Great Danes.  We have had 9 rescue Danes of our own and have helped our local rescue groups over the years with transporting, fund raising, and placing numerous Danes with their forever families.  It became our passion.</h3><p><strong>One thing became very clear.  Danes come in all different sizes as well as colors.  Our largest weighing in at 225lbs and standing 35 inches at his shoulder.  Our smallest at 95lbs and only 25 inches at her shoulder.  That is a huge difference.  We found ourselves improvising with household items, including boxes, plastic buckets, tables, etc. to make an elevated feeder that was the right height for their individual needs.</strong></p><p><strong>Most of the “over the counter” feeders at the local pet stores just didn’t cut it.  Too short, bowls too small, too flimsy, too unstable.  You get the idea.  Jim’s mission became designing a feeder that could be easily adjusted to fit the needs of each dog.  After almost 2 years of prototypes and improvised devices, The Perfect Fit Feeder is born. </strong></p><p><strong>Our campaign is important to us for many reasons.  Most of all, to allow us to continue our rescue efforts and “Paw It Forward” in the rescue community.  We have set up a program, on our website, that allows the customer to select a rescue group of their choice, when purchasing a Perfect Fit Feeder, and we will donate 5% to that rescue group.  Your donation to our campaign will allow us to expand this program to several rescue groups and animal advocate programs across the country.  In our first month, we have been able to donate proceeds from our sales to 4 different groups.  We want to include many more non-profit 501(c)(3) groups to our Paw It Forward Program.  You can help us make that happen.</strong></p><p><strong>Secondly, we want to fulfill our dream at our Raising Danes Sanctuary.  We purchased 13 acres of land a few years back and we have cleared it, built our home on it, built a warehouse, and we want to take it to the next level.  Our dream is to build a high end facility that will allow us to help our local rescue groups with fostering, meet and greets, play dates, and family friendly events.  Eventually, we hope to offer day care and boarding, catering to medium and large breeds.  We have the time, the space and now we need your help with the funding.  Help us make The Raising Danes Sanctuary a reality.  You can visit our Raising Danes Sanctuary Page on Facebook and our website for more details.  Your contributions to this campaign can help us make this happen.</strong></p><p><strong>We have spent the last year designing and manufacturing The Perfect Fit Feeder and we are proud to announce that it now ready to ship.  That is what makes this campaign risk free.  We have invested in the injection molds, patent process, test markets, marketing tools and all the products components.  It is ready to ship to your doorstep so please share this campaign

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>We are a woman-owned family business, headquartered in Atlanta, GA, </p>
<p>Out of frustration trying to find stylish clothes to fit our autistic daughter, we started DuziScan because the fashion industry's ready-to-wear, mass-produced sizing no longer works!  As technology advances, DuziScan sees the fashion marketplace trending to individualized, affordably-made bespoke and made-to-measure clothing, merging Fashion with Tech.</p>
<p>Using our custom Mobile 3D infrared body scanner and avatar technology, we include the consumer in creating a fashion experience that lets them direct style and gives them a perfect fit.</p>
<p>Why we are using a full size scanner instead of mobile device apps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mobile device apps aren't accurate enough to eliminate alterations and returns.</li>
<li>AND, they can't be used for large groups quickly or with accuracy, because it depends on   each user's skill holding the device.</li>
</ul>
<h2>A Note on Perks</h2>
<p>Because we are more service oriented, we are offering DuziScan swag options for anyone who is not in the U.S. Southeast where our current truck and office are located.  Otherwise we will offer Body Scan discounts as well as In-House design discounts for made-to-measure options.  Shipping is Never charged on the 3D Body Scan discounts. </p>
<h2>How are we poised to accomplish this?</h2>
<p>DuziScan has a 3-phase roll out plan, that we hope you will want to partner with us to create a major shift in the fashion industry!</p>
<p>In our first phase, which we have spent all of our savings to start, we:</p>
<ul>
<li>Purchased the industry's most accurate 3D Infrared Body Scanner and avatar technology, which completes a full scan in 3 seconds! </li>
<li>Customized the scanner in a truck to create a fantastic mobile experience!</li>
<li>Acquired large Plotter, to work with our CAD system to create and print patterns based on individual scan data</li>
</ul>
<p>Who Can Use DuziScan™:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<i><strong>Individuals</strong></i> (men &amp; women) who want bespoke clothing.  Choose from our In-house designs for women or your own tailor/designer.</li>
<li>
<i><strong>Groups</strong></i> who require uniforms or costumes.  DuziScan™ can send scans to your manufacturer/designer or we can complete the process of pattern creation, cutting, sewing and delivery.</li>
<li>
<i><strong>Designers</strong></i> who want to integrate body scans for their clients’ perfect fit. Partner with DuziScan™ to use our pattern creation, cutting and sewing equipment.</li>
<li>
<strong><i>Manufacturers</i></strong> who want little to no alterations or returns based on fit.  DuziScan™ can travel to and scan your clients’ groups and interface with your CAD system.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Phase II and III:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Lease commercial space &amp; equipment for in-house scanning and custom pattern creation and sewing</li>
<li>Build 5 more mobile scanning vehicles for the top US markets</li>
<li>Build a world-class team of business, fashion and engineering professionals and advisors</li>
<li>Expand relationships with designers, retailers, uniform and costume manufacturers</li>
<li>Develop special closures and integrate SMART technology fabrics to help physically and neurologically disabled people have affordable, in-style clothing - so they can dress with independence!</li>
<li>Digital fabric printing to reduce environmental stresses and keep manufacturing in the U.S.</li>
<li>Develop mobile device app by partnering with mobile device mfgs for first ever real accurate scan</li>
<li>Patent Processes</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>By Partnering with DuziScan as a contributor, you will make it possible for us to</p>
<p>Begin working on Phases II and III immediately.  $500,000 is a great start and will allow us to also begin on each area.  One of the most important areas is hiring amazing engineers, consultants and tech savvy individuals!</p>

</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>As with any change in industry trends, we certainly face push back from the mass producers of general size clothing.  The big conversation in the fashion industry is Fit but so far their solutions have been to rely on customers to measure themselves or hope that current mobile apps are good enough; they're even exploring bringing Bespoke to the masses.  We think, let's start small and assume the customer is smart enough to be part of their wardrobe creation.  Plus it allows us access to new, local designers with great ideas.</p>
<p>Further, being a small innovator allows us the flexibility of moving in new directions and tackling problems like closures for disabled people to dress independently.  It also allows us the opportunity to create in-house designs in areas where we see serious flaws, i.e. swimwear and foundation garments.</p>
<p>We will have to be careful to stick with our stated objectives; we have enough already!!  </p>
<p>To help us, we listen to industry experts and seek to have business mentors.  We find these amazing people give us ideas and boundaries to stay on track and be as successful as possible.  It's amazing to have so many people who see the vision and are willing to give their time and ideas and we are very grateful!</p>

Our Brand Mission is to share what we love to create with the people we love (you!) in an environment that fosters self-love, inclusivity and positivity.  We are two young girls with a goal to make size and gender inclusive handmade lingerie, as well as other skincare and lifestyle products. We currently are hosted on Etsy and make appearances at local festivals (check us out at pride this July!) and Flea Markets, but have a goal to open an online shop on our own domain, and eventually a small store :)As two students months away from graduation, funds are tight. We have put every spare dollar (and not so spare dollar) into making and perfecting our products, and supplies are not cheap! By helping us reach our goal for our startup, we'll be able to invest in things like:
A Second Sewing Machine/Serger (please!) 
Fabrics and sewing supplies
Packaging
Printmaking
Business cards
Web Domain Fees 
Production of Products
Festival and Market Fees
and so much more!
