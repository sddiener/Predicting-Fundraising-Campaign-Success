turn based 4X: eXplore, eXpand, eXploit and eXterminate game, with real-time
combat. You will play as Emperor/King/Leader/... leading your civilization into
space.

<p>Most 4X games let you play
a complex game of risk. In HOO we want to achieve a much more sophisticated
goal. We give you the opportunity to shape the galaxy the way you like it.</p>
<p>Your armies and fleets will
not be nameless entities. Your troops have officers, your armies have generals,
your ships have captains and your fleets are commanded by admirals. All of them
gather experience, get promoted, they have skills, goals and wishes and will
always try to fulfill them. Your interaction with them and every
decision you make will have an impact on your people, your officers and on
other civilizations and will finally form the nature of your empire.</p>
<p>Who do you like to be? A
dark emperor or a king of hearts?</p>
<p>Play it your way!</p>

<p>After the reading of the
summary you will certainly have some questions and would like to know more
about some of the more innovative features. In the next chapters I will try to
explain some of them in much more detail.</p>
<p><b>Ever changing galaxy</b></p>
<p>With each game start
everything in the galaxy is procedurally generated: star systems, technology
tree, resources, encounters, quests and much more. No game will be like the
other.</p>
<p><b>Minor races and independent
factions</b></p>
<p>Minor races start
technological behind and will not be able to leave there planetary boundaries.
Give them space faring technology or slave them. Like everywhere else in the
game the decision is fully upon you.</p>
<p>Independent factions could
be anything from pirates to exiled governments.</p>
<p>Like every other faction
these minor races and independent factions will have schemes to rise to power.
You can plainly crush them, help them reach their goals or maybe you will find a
way to use them for your purposes.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>The role play in the
strategy</b></p>
<p>You are not some almighty
entity instead you will be represented by a character with stats and skills in
the game.</p>
<p>Your ships and planets are
filled with officers, crewmembers, politicians and other important persons.
Everyone with his own intentions, goals and preferences.</p>
<p>Your decisions and actions
will influence the moral and loyalty of your people.</p>
<p><i>If you play a very war centric race and always be the happy fluffy guy
that never wage war against diplomatic enemies your people will quickly lose
their trust in you...</i></p>
<p>Quests! Yes it's a strategy
game with quests. Kill the roaming pirate fleet and get some ultra rare
minerals you can use to build your next flagship.</p>
<p><b>Individual ships and
weapons</b></p>
<p>Combine different
technologies and materials to build the weapons of your choice.</p>
<p>To design a new ship type
you choose the hull type, weapons and components to fit together. Furthermore
you decide which materials should be used for basic systems like armor, hull or
energy systems.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/988183/files/20141105061817-DreadnoughtVsAlien.png?1415197097"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/>
<p></p>
<p><b>Just another service
provided by your friendly neighborhood Space-Monster!</b></p>
<p>Space monsters! A lot of
different space monsters! But also these will not be mindless entities. They
will have different motivations to do what they do.</p>
<p><i>Maybe your space fleet is mostly build from a material this giant
crystal thingy loves so much. In that case it will hunt down one ship after
another and ignores ships built from other materials.</i></p>
<p><b>No story, but history!</b></p>
<p>With the initialization of
the galaxy a history will be generated that will cover heroes, diplomatic
problems, epic battles and much more.</p>
<p>The events in the past
influence the actual game background and will be reflected in form of different
story arcs or modifiers.</p>
<p>This logic provides
different storylines that can be explored and giving you an unpredictable<span>  and exciting game each time you start.</span></p>
<p>Here is an example for such
an event:</p>
<p><i>08. 01.2114 A diplomatic convoy of ambassador Kre'Te from the Deeper
Hive was attacked and destroyed by unidentified ships. Rescue teams are on the
way to search for survivors.</i></p>
<p>This can lead to either:</p>
<p><i>16.01.2114 The rescue team searching for survivors of the lost
diplomatic convoy from Kre'Te did not find any survivors. The mastermind behind
the attack could not be found.</i></p>
<p>or:</p>
<p><i>16.01.2114 The rescue team searching for survivors of the diplomatic
convoy from Kre'Te did find some survivors hiding in the debris. They
identified the attacking ships as a Human Empire battle cruisers.</i></p>
<p><i>17.01.2114 The Deep Hive declared war on the Human Empire.</i></p>
<p>You can now be sure that later
in the game the Human Empire and the Deep Hive will have some certain
diplomatic modifiers when dealing with each other.</p>

<br/></div>","Update 2:The campaign is slowly comming to an end but you will still be able to support and preorder the game on the official site: Preorder hereUpdate:A demo of the tactical battle part of the game is now available. For ingame help press F1.
Be aware this is a demo of Pre-Alpha content and will be consistantly extended with new features.
You can download the installer  here.Please support the game on Steam GreenlightHello my name is Christian
Telefont, I am the founder of Igniting Neurons, a small Independent
Game Studio in Vienna, Austria.

This campaign is about our
first game Heirs of Orion.
I am a professional
software developer with a lot of experience in developing high performance
software for video playback and interactive vending experience.You can read more about me and Igniting Neurons at our site.


Heirs Of Orion (HOO) is a
turn based 4X: eXplore, eXpand, eXploit and eXterminate game, with real-time
combat. You will play as Emperor/King/Leader/... leading your civilization into
space.

Most 4X games let you play
a complex game of risk. In HOO we want to achieve a much more sophisticated
goal. We give you the opportunity to shape the galaxy the way you like it.
Your armies and fleets will
not be nameless entities. Your troops have officers, your armies have generals,
your ships have captains and your fleets are commanded by admirals. All of them
gather experience, get promoted, they have skills, goals and wishes and will
always try to fulfill them. Your interaction with them and every
decision you make will have an impact on your people, your officers and on
other civilizations and will finally form the nature of your empire.
Who do you like to be? A
dark emperor or a king of hearts?
Play it your way!
Summary
· 
procedurally generated
galaxy, history, resources, encounters, quests,...
· 
story arcs will evolve
based on history
· 
turn based hex field
strategy with real-time combat
· 
battles with hundreds of
ships at the same time· 
space monsters and galactic
disasters· 
minor races and independent
factions like pirates, mercenaries, rebels
· 
design your ships and
weapons
· 
random technology tree· 
your empire is filled with
officers like admirals, ambassadors, scientists,   administrators,... all with different skills and
attributes
· 
a loyalty system based on
empire focus, fear, honor, ...
After the reading of the
summary you will certainly have some questions and would like to know more
about some of the more innovative features. In the next chapters I will try to
explain some of them in much more detail.
Ever changing galaxy
With each game start
everything in the galaxy is procedurally generated: star systems, technology
tree, resources, encounters, quests and much more. No game will be like the
other.
Minor races and independent
factions
Minor races start
technological behind and will not be able to leave there planetary boundaries.
Give them space faring technology or slave them. Like everywhere else in the
game the decision is fully upon you.
Independent factions could
be anything from pirates to exiled governments.
Like every other faction
these minor races and independent factions will have schemes to rise to power.
You can plainly crush them, help them reach their goals or maybe you will find a
way to use them for your purposes.

The role play in the
strategy
You are not some almighty
entity instead you will be represented by a character with stats and skills in
the game.
Your ships and planets are
filled with officers, crewmembers, politicians and other important persons.
Everyone with his own intentions, goals and preferences.
Your decisions and actions
will influence the moral and loyalty of your people.
If you play a very war centric race and always be the happy fluffy guy
that never wage war against diplomatic enemies your people will quickly lose
their trust in you...
Quests! Yes it's a strategy
game with quests. Kill the roaming pirate fleet and get some ultra rare
minerals you can use to build your next flagship.
Individual ships and
weapons
Combine different
technologies and materials to build the weapons of your choice.
To design a new ship type
you choose the hull type, weapons and components to fit together. Furthermore
you decide which materials should be used for basic systems like armor, hull or
energy systems.

Just another service
provided by your friendly neighborhood Space-Monster!
Space monsters! A lot of
different space monsters! But also these will not be mindless entities. They
will have different motivations to do what they do.
Maybe your space fleet is mostly build from a material this giant
crystal thingy loves so much. In that case it will hunt down one ship after
another and ignores ships built from other materials.
No story, but history!
With the initialization of
the galaxy a history will be generated that will cover heroes, diplomatic
problems, epic battles and much more.
The events in the past
influence the actual game background and will be reflected in form of different
story arcs or modifiers.
This logic provides
different storylines that can be explored and giving you an unpredictable  and exciting game each time you start.
Here is an example for such
an event:
08. 01.2114 A diplomatic convoy of ambassador Kre'Te from the Deeper
Hive was attacked and destroyed by unidentified ships. Rescue teams are on the
way to search for survivors.
This can lead to either:
16.01.2114 The rescue team searching for survivors of the lost
diplomatic convoy from Kre'Te did not find any survivors. The mastermind behind
the attack could not be found.
or:
16.01.2114 The rescue team searching for survivors of the diplomatic
convoy from Kre'Te did find some survivors hiding in the debris. They
identified the attacking ships as a Human Empire battle cruisers.
17.01.2114 The Deep Hive declared war on the Human Empire.
You can now be sure that later
in the game the Human Empire and the Deep Hive will have some certain
diplomatic modifiers when dealing with each other.
The game will be designed
with casual multiplayer in mind. Find friends and foes all around the world or
right next to you.

<h3>
<br/>Story Summary</h3>
<p>Days of Ragnarok's Awakening takes place in a large and immerse fictional world known as Loia. An ancient being known as Ragnarok awakes from his dormant state and true to the ancient texts and prophesies the moments of his awakening creates many events that threaten Loia and the universe itself. These events happen for many weeks, but suddenly stop. Legends say this is only the beginning of what is to come. Months later, Lucus Greenstone sets off to find his brother in order to bring him to home to see their dying mother. During his trip he discovers that he is the chosen one who will bring an end the Ragnarok prophesied my the monks of Asiril. Promised that he'll see his brother soon, he accepts his destiny and heads towards the city of Asaril to speak to the monks that will help him fulfill his destiny. During his quest, he'll meet a countless number of friends and foes.</p>
<p><strong><span style=""font-size: medium;"">Champions</span></strong><br/> Champions play an integral role in the gameplay of DoRA, as the object of the game is to lower your opponent's champion's health down to zero, whoever does so winning the game. Each champion has a class and an element. (The element is indicated by color of the card's trim.) The class is shown in the top corner of the card's infobox. Each hero also has Health and Mana points. The amount of health that a champion has is indicated by the number in the red orb on the lower right corner of the card. The amount of mana a champion has is indicated by the number in the blue orb on the lower left corner of its card. Each champion also has two abilities. The first (the top ability) is usually weaker and requires less mana than the bottom ability which is usually a more powerful version of the first ability, although it isn't always so. These abilities usually require a certain amount of mana in order to be used and once they are used they cannot be used again until a certain amount of time. This ""cooldown time"" and is the red text next to or under an ability's effect. The cost of an ability is indicated by the numbers in the blue circles with the gold trim in the info box of the card.</p>

This cost is found in the top grey orb next to the name for the card of every card. Some creatures require a specific amount of a certain terrain element in order to be summoned. These amounts are indicated the colored circles underneath the total cost. Some creatures also have effects that can help your champion in battle. These effects act similarly to the ability cards of Champions; they can either boost stats of other creatures or affect the enemy or game in some way. <br/><br/> Creatures have attack, health and speed points. This points are the shown in the 3 circles under the name of the card. Attack is how much damage a card does to an enemy's champion or creatures. Health is how many attack points a creature can suffer before dying and speed determines which creature attacks first when battling another creature. When two creatures battle, the creature with the higher speed point attacks first regardless of which creature declared an attack. If the number is the same, the creature who declared the attack attacks first. It is important to note that a champion does not have speed however when a creature attacks a Champion with a weapon, the creature attacks first unless stated otherwise.</p>

We need about 25,000 thousand dollars. The Indiegogo's and paypal's cut, the beakdown of how the money will be spent is (Please note these are estimates):

$17,000 will go primarily to the art. We realize it's a lot, but artists need eat too. Many card illustrators will go 250-1000 USD dollars per card.
$2000 will go to acquiring Unity Pro and the team license for it. Unity Pro is the engine we will be using the make the game, and the license allows all the members of the team to use a copy of unity pro.
$1500 will go towards acquiring music for the game.
$2000 will go towards shipping out perks!
Any extra will help us finish up the game, as well as beginning the funding for DoRA's first sub-expansion, Light and Darkness.

In exchange for funding the project, we offer you a bunch of great perks. These perks include wallpapers, the original soundtrack for the game, demo access, a physical promotional card securing a name and account for the game, In-game currency to buy cards and other goodies in the game, beta access and of course, those who pay the big bucks will be able to create their own cards for the game, and even have say in the gameplay, features and future expansions.
Stretch goals will be released upon reaching our goal!
Ooo~ Exclusive Physical Promo Card!Remember: You can create your playable own cards for the game!

The Impact!
Believe us when we say you have the power to make the game the best it can be. Your contributions will vastly improve both the quality and your overall gaming experience, as well as that of others. DoRA is not a game changer, it was never meant to be. We want to give players a community driven online TCG experience, This includes online events and tournaments and other goodies. If enough funds are raised or the game does well, we plan to expand the game to have servers for different languages. Look at the success of Pokemon, Yugioh and the Granddaddy of them all, Magic. These games are made popular and are filled with community and playing experience growth due to the different kinds of people that they reach! We want to do this, you can make this happen!

<h2>Ikarus, the Alliance Superior</h2>
<p>We created a flexible campaign for building the three superior combatants for our bands. We did not reach its target but we are committed to build the three miniatures anyway. We already have or first superior casted, the Ikarus and this campaign is to speed up the casting of the other two.</p>
<p>We will share with you all details of the creation of the Ikarus from the first concepts to the latest pictures of the actual miniature.</p>
<p>This was the first concept of the Ikarus. We used it in the race deck as well as the rulebook:</p>
<p><img alt=""Ikarus first concept"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i278.photobucket.com/albums/kk87/yordiket/Iacutekar_colo_zps4b7d6165.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Ikarus first concept""/></p>
<div>
<p>When we made the first indiegogo campaign, Juan Navarro our sculptor made these diagrams to think about the proportions of the miniatures:</p>
<p><img alt=""Superior combatants"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i278.photobucket.com/albums/kk87/yordiket/Minis-reference-size.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Superior combatants""/></p>
<p>This was the actual concept made to start thinking how to sculpt the Ikarus, here appeared the idea of the eagle helmet derived from the Geared Eagle of the Newborns form which the Alliance stole the Ikarus' propotype.</p>
<p><img alt=""Ikarus Concept"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/550079/pictures/full/20121122123243-ICARO_low.jpg?1353616366"" src="""" style="""" title=""Ikarus concept""/></p>
<p>From here, Fausto started to sculpt the miniature in 3D. Initially with few detail:</p>
<p><img alt=""Ikarus sculpted 01"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i278.photobucket.com/albums/kk87/yordiket/Ikarus/Ik_wip_02_zps6f868de1.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: left;"" title=""Ikarus sculpted 01""/><img alt=""ikarus work in progress"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i278.photobucket.com/albums/kk87/yordiket/Ikarus/Ik_wip_05_zps7fb324b2.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: right;"" title=""ikarus work in progress""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Bit by bit some more detail was added: </p>

<p>Then, it got wings and more engraving details:</p>

<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>To, finally, get its final details, guns and a final pose: </p>

<p>Final? well, not really, the digital sculpt was finished, it was 3D-printed and Juan Navarro took Fausto's printed digital sculpture and added a female head (used when playing with the Mercenaries of Isha subfaction) and a beautiful base:</p>

NotEye provides a graphical front end to textual roguelikes and seems to be the perfect option to provide tile support for ADOM (and best of all: for ADOM II, too, so effectively you are supporting two games in one). This will allow for</p>
<ul>
<li>graphical tile sets in various resolutions (32x32 and 64x64 at least)</li>
<li>custom tile sets provided by the community</li>
<li>selecting either a graphical or ASCII version of ADOM for play</li>

<p>This stretch goal will provide a customized tile set for ADOM, done solely by Krys, our artist. Krys will do his utmost to create the most beautiful tile set ever. And the tile set will not only benefit ADOM but it also could be used for ADOM II. If we reach this stretch goal I thus promise that I'm then going to add tile support to ADOM II, to.

<p>Yes, I've finally broken in and added two new pledge level: The <em>""Master Thief""</em> pledge level and the ""<em>Avatar of Thieves</em>"" pledge level can now be selected to gain a highly limited copy of the <strong>ADOM Classic Boxed Set</strong>!</p>
<p>The ADOM Classic Boxed Set is a truly unique and amazing collectors item that I personally will handcraft in our basement (box, hand-glued cover and all), sign and package. At the <em>Master Thief</em> pledge level it will contain the following once-in-a-life-time items:</p>
<ul>
<li>Boxed Set with hand glued limited edition print cover painted by Krzysztof Dycha,</li>
<li>Collector's Certificate (with print number ranging from 1 to 100 depending on your position as a donor for this pledge level; first come, first serve),</li>
<li>a CD with another limited print containing ADOM 1.2.0 for all available platforms, all documents for the game _and_ the oldest ADOM version we still manage to compile from the sources to get a unique glimpse into the past (probably just for Linux or DOS - we need to check that)</li>
<li>a hand selected 20 sided die that will be tuned by myself to roll with luck by hand-rolling it 27 times (guess why?),</li>
<li>a print version of the ""ADOM Lite RPG"" (<strong>UPDATE 08/08/2012: buffed to 64 pages in size!!!</strong>) that contains a very simple but complete rules set for pen &amp; paper RPG campaigns set in the world of Ancardia,</li>

<p>You find the two new pledge levels in the section to the right!</p>
<p>Add $10 for shipping within Germany, $20 for shipping within Europe and $40 for the rest of the world (I know, that's high, but shipping costs from Germany are insane - I was shocked myself concerning the prices for packages :-( ). Shipping is included starting with the <em>Legend</em> level.</p>
<p><span><strong>PLEDGE UPDATE #5: Fifth power pledge drive over!</strong></span></p>
<p>The fifth and final power pledge drive: Arifacts netted a total of 32 (!) new items and 46 new artifacts to be added to the game. Wow :-) These totals have already been added to the total below.</p>
<p><strong>PLEDGE UPDATE #2: Second power pledge drive over!</strong></p>

<p><strong>PLEDGE UPDATE #1: First power pledge drive over!</strong></p>
<div>Due to the amazing amount of pledges 12 new corruptions will be added to ADOM 1.2.0 and the corruption system itself will be even more randomized.</div>
<p><strong>ABOUT THIS PROJECT</strong></p>
<p><a href=""http://www.ancientdomainsofmystery.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""The ADOM &amp; ADOM II Blog"">ADOM</a> is one of the <a href=""http://www.google.com/search?q=ancient+domains+of+mystery"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""ADOM @ Google"">most successful roguelike games ever created</a>, with downloads in the millions and many more every day. ADOM was the first roguelike to add a true role-playing experience to the roguelike genre, and boasts <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=ancient+domains+of+mystery"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""ADOM @ YouTube"">a brilliant mix of story, exploration, and intensely strategic and flexible combat</a>. ADOM was in development from 1994 until November 2002, when the last build was released. ADOM is still part of the roguelike conversation, even after ten years of frozen development.</p>
<p><img alt=""Concept art sketch"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/313624/pictures/full/20120703142200-ADOMImpression.png?1341350550"" src="""" style="""" title=""Concept art sketch""/></p>
<p>ADOM is primarily known for being the first roguelike to include vibrant towns, NPC dialog, and quests, but it offers more than just a rich story line in a complex fantasy world:</p>
<ul>
<li>A huge game world with dozens of locations such as towns, randomized dungeons, and secrets</li>
<li>Loads of races and classes allowing for almost infinite play styles</li>
<li>Hundreds of monsters and items, many with enhanced random features</li>
<li>A corruption system forcing you to balance lust for power with fear of damnation</li>
<li>Spells, prayers, mindcraft, alchemy, and more</li>
<li>Dozens of quests and branching story lines</li>
<li>Numerous wildly different endings that might alter reality itself!</li>
</ul><p>Sadly, although ADOM was highly polished, it was <a href=""http://www.adom.de/adom/download.php3"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Download ADOM and try it!"">left in an unfinished state</a>. Bugs, loopholes and other problems have been identified over the years, but I never had the resources to fix them. I believe I’ve found just the team of experienced, enthusiastic developers and artists to pick up where I left off and make ADOM something truly epic.</p>
<p><strong><img alt=""Ancient Domains Of Mystery Logo"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.adom.de/front-gfx/adom-title.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Ancient Domains Of Mystery Logo""/>DEATH OR GLORY - I NEED YOUR HELP!</strong></p>
<p>If this Indiegogo campaign is successful in reaching the funding goal, you will see a new release of ADOM, version 1.2.0. Here are some of the things you can expect:</p>
<ul>
<li>New stable releases for all supported platforms (Windows, Linux, MacOS, Amiga, NetBSD, FreeBSD; Android and iPad/iOS are going to be stretch goals). Operating systems have evolved since 2002 and compatibility is becoming a serious issue.</li>
<li>Bug fixes for every bug we can find</li>
<li>Game balance patches</li>
<li>At least 12 new corruptions will be added to the corruption system.</li>
<li>45 new items will be added (but see below for that extra level).</li>
<li>46 new artifacts will be added (available as subsets per game, but see below for that extra level).</li>
<li>4 new monsters will be added (but see below for that extra level).</li>
<li>As a result of ""getting over with funding on August 22nd"" an extra special new boss monster with a special new map, 2 new artifacts, 4 new minion monsters for said boss and 16 new items that only will be recoverable on said special level are going to be added to the game.</li>
<li>More elaborate interaction for many things that are currently only handled superficially</li>
<li>UI improvements to bring ADOM up-to-date with the progress the roguelike genre has made, to be decided upon based on recommendations of players in the forums (e.g. colored message, some kind of auto-exploration and others)</li>
<li>A series of magical statues distributed across the dungeons</li>
<li>A roster of new named random boss monsters with special powers</li>
<li>Exciting new graphics for the title screen and some quest-related events</li>
<li>Audio for sound effects and music for the game areas and important events</li>
<li>A freshly revised manual</li>
</ul><p>Honestly, I have very high hopes for ADOM. I’m keeping this campaign modest, but I have big ideas in case we surpass the goal. I‘ll be announcing the stretch goals later in the campaign, but let me give you a taste of what I have in mind. I‘m thinking at least two new races and classes, builds for Android and iOS, a scripting module for user extensions, and finally, the release of the ADOM source code as open source, with community management, building, and training included.</p>
<p><strong>THE TEAM</strong></p>
<p>An amazing team has gathered to support me in continuing the ADOM story. With your support, I’ll be adding Jochen Terstiege as co-developer, Krzysztof Dycha as the lead artist, and Oneiros Dieguez as lead composer and sound magician. All three will be involved and paid to help in reviving the development of ADOM.</p>
<p>Jochen has been following and supporting ADOM since the early days and has built many of the ports. I have known him for more than twenty years, and we have worked together in a professional environment for more than eight. Oneiros blew me away with his ability to create immersive sounds and compose memorable music. He is a professional musician by trade and has years of experience in the field. Krys is a talented computer artist who I met through the ADOM II community design competition, which he won. He has some great ideas for a new graphical user experience for the blog and the game. He's a professional artist and works with computer companies and studios.</p>
<p><strong>WHY INVEST IN ME?</strong></p>
<p>I have put many thousands of hours, if not tens of thousands, into ADOM development and shown my ability to produce an original and polished product, which has proved immensely popular. All this I did while asking only for postcards from fans, of which I have gratefully received a great many. Unfortunately, life has changed, and my goals exceed my resources. I'm calling on those who love the game and want to see it improved to invest to give ADOM the rebirth it deserves. I place tremendous value on ADOM, and I know its fans do too. Please put your faith in me and I will show you what a seasoned developer can do. ADOM will remain free, but your investment will help give it a new lease of life.</p>
<p><strong>HOW DOES THIS CROWD FUNDING THING WORK?</strong></p>
<p>Easy. You pledge an amount of money you choose (see the sidebar to the right). The pledge will be withdrawn from your account immediately. If the campaign fails to reach its goal and the minimum of $48,000 is not reached, your pledge will be refunded at the end of the campaign.</p>
<p>This is an all-or-nothing campaign. I do not believe in delivering inferior work with insufficient funds. Either enough money is raised to do an absolutely great job or we'll drop it, mourn, and get on with our lives. Your money only will be used if our goal is met. Otherwise, Indiegogo will refund your pledges at the end of the campaign.</p>
<p><strong>HOW CAN YOU HELP?</strong></p>
<p>First and foremost by pledging. Your contributions are the fuel this project needs to reach its goals. We can’t get anywhere without you. Donate today to get this train rolling!</p>
<p>And as importantly, by spreading the word and sharing the campaign via the Indiegogo tools, on social networks, blogs, forums--basically everywhere. Talk to friends and other gamers about it. Share the link. There once were hundreds of thousands of fans out there, if not millions, but many of them are not plugged in to the community and are hard for me to find. Let them know that today is the day!</p>
<p><strong>LET’S MAKE THIS HAPPEN!</strong></p>
<p>ADOM is in your hands. You are the ADOM tribe and you will determine the further fate of ADOM. You’ve been incredible supporters and friends, and I believe that with your help, we can create something truly memorable.</p></div>","The ADOM crowd funding campaign is over and it was a MIND-BLOWING success. Thank you to all who participated and help to carry this campaign so much further than I ever dreamt of... and read the latest updates on the blog.
 

 (listen to the March of Triumph by Lucas Dieguez)
 
The following chart shows the stretch goals we managed to achieve.

 
The following explanations detail the individual stretch goal levels.
 
STRETCH GOAL #1: NOTEYE SUPPORT ($50,000, ACHIEVED!)
As the first stretch goal we intend to integrate Zeno's NotEye into ADOM. NotEye provides a graphical front end to textual roguelikes and seems to be the perfect option to provide tile support for ADOM (and best of all: for ADOM II, too, so effectively you are supporting two games in one). This will allow for

graphical tile sets in various resolutions (32x32 and 64x64 at least)
custom tile sets provided by the community
selecting either a graphical or ASCII version of ADOM for play
the possibility of a 3D mode (even if it's more of a joke mode)
Our Youtube video video shows a sample demo, using NotEye, a demo tile set and an early version of a composition by Lucas Dieguez. Enjoy!
The following image gives a more detailed impression of what NotEye can do for ADOM:


STRETCH GOAL #2: CUSTOMIZED TILE SET ($55,000, unlocked)
This stretch goal will provide a customized tile set for ADOM, done solely by Krys, our artist. Krys will do his utmost to create the most beautiful tile set ever. And the tile set will not only benefit ADOM but it also could be used for ADOM II. If we reach this stretch goal I thus promise that I'm then going to add tile support to ADOM II, to. See the image below for a sample of what Krys is capable of:



STRETCH GOAL #3: ADDITIONAL CLASSES AND RACES ($60,000, unlocked)
 
Two new PC races will be added: Mist Elves and Ratlings. Two new PC classes will be added: Duelists and Chaos Knights.

 
STRETCH GOAL #4: ADOM DELUXE ON STEAM ($65,000, unlocked)

 
At this level we will produce the long ago promised Deluxe version of ADOM, specifically to be published to Steam. And we'd try to do our best to also support other platforms like Gamersgate and Desudura. All donors from the $40 and above levels of this campaign will receive a free license for ADOM Deluxe if we reach this level. ADOM Deluxe will include new challenge games, restorable save files and an extended character generation process allowing you to select from more options. ADOM Classic still will remain free, the idea of this stretch goal is to use the awesome tile support at this level to make ADOM Deluxe more of a mainstream game in order to be able to fund the continuing development of the free ADOM Classic version. 

STRETCH GOAL #5: ACHIEVEMENTS ($70,000, unlocked)
At this level we will add achievement systems and global high scores to the game, hopefully even more furthering the appeal to more casual gamers. 

STRETCH GOAL #6: VOLCANO QUEST ($75,000, unlocked) 
A highly detailed and extensive quest related to volcanoes (no, not a boring variant to the tower of eternal flames) will be added to the game. It's going to be chilling to the bone, believe me! 

STRETCH GOAL #7: QUEST FOR ROLF ($80,000, unlocked)
The mysteries surrounding Rolf finally will be solved with a series of exiting new levels and quests introducing many new monsters, items and artifacts and unravelling one of the many mysteries of AODM.

STRETCH GOAL #8: TWO MORE NEW QUESTS ($85,000, unlocked)
Two additional new quests will be added to the game, details to be discussed with the community.

STRETCH GOAL #9: THREE MORE NEW QUESTS ($90,000, unlocked literally in the last second of the campaign)
Three additional new quests will be added to the game, details to be discussed with the community. 

STRETCH GOAL #10: FOUR MORE NEW QUESTS (upon reaching $95,000)
Four additional new quests will be added to the game, details to be discussed with the community.

STRETCH GOAL #11: FULL-COLOR ADOM Lite RPG (upon reaching $100,000)
At this level the ADOM Lite RPG will be done in full color. All donors for the RPG will receive this upgraded print for free!
That's it, folks. If we ever should come close to the stretch goals in the nineties I will think of more exciting stuff!
STRETCH GOAL #12: iPad Support (upon reaching $110,000)
At this level we'll produce both ADOM and ADOM Deluxe (with tiles support!) for the iPad.
STRETCH GOAL #13: HARDCOVER ADOM RPG (upon reaching $120,000)
At this level the ADOM Lite RPG will be transformed into a full-blown RPG, full color, hardcover, 128 pages. Getting this instead of ADOM Lite will cost an extra $20 (sorry, but I just checked with Lulu and printing this alone will cost more than $30 per item, shipment costs not included, can't do it for free as originally announced lest I'll actually lose money meant to be spent for ADOM development :-( That's what you get for making up extra stretch goals without thinking about them). But this version later on also will be available via the standard Lulu shop.
STRETCH GOAL #14: Android support (upon reaching $130,000)
At this level ADOM and ADOM Deluxe will be ported to Android tablets.
 
PLEDGE UPDATE #4: ADOM Lite RPG for everyone!
Since there have been quite a few requests and since I faltered and started giving out physical gifts in any case I now have decided to make the ""ADOM Lite RPG"" from the ""Master Thief"" pledge level available to anyone. There now is a new ""Seeker"" pledge level at $40 that will give you the following:

Your receive the 64 page (yes, I have upped the page count!!!) ""ADOM Lite RPG"" that previously only was included in the $400+ pledge levels.
Each print version will be signed and numbered.
Add $25 for each additional copy you would like to receive.
This is a once-in-a-life-time offer. The ""ADOM Lite RPG"" never again will be printed or distributed once this crowd funding campaign is over!
Shipping included!
If you are interested now is the time - the opportunity never will come back! And the ""Master Thief"" donors also benefit - to compensate for the general availability of the ADOM Lite RPG they will receive an additional 32 page ""ADOM Lite RPG Arcana"" RPG supplement that also never again will be reprinted and includes the rules for advanced and master classes for PCs. Additionally it serves as a preview of what it to come in that respect in ADOM II as ADOM includes multi-classing and special classes for high level characters.
UPDATE: ADOM 1.2.0 p1 and p2 are out!
Read all details and if you haven't pledged so far use the opportunity to convince yourself that we are dead serious and would love to have your support!
PLEDGE UPDATE #3: Purchase the limited edition ADOM Classic Boxed Set!
Yes, I've finally broken in and added two new pledge level: The ""Master Thief"" pledge level and the ""Avatar of Thieves"" pledge level can now be selected to gain a highly limited copy of the ADOM Classic Boxed Set!
The ADOM Classic Boxed Set is a truly unique and amazing collectors item that I personally will handcraft in our basement (box, hand-glued cover and all), sign and package. At the Master Thief pledge level it will contain the following once-in-a-life-time items:

Boxed Set with hand glued limited edition print cover painted by Krzysztof Dycha,
Collector's Certificate (with print number ranging from 1 to 100 depending on your position as a donor for this pledge level; first come, first serve),
a CD with another limited print containing ADOM 1.2.0 for all available platforms, all documents for the game _and_ the oldest ADOM version we still manage to compile from the sources to get a unique glimpse into the past (probably just for Linux or DOS - we need to check that)
a hand selected 20 sided die that will be tuned by myself to roll with luck by hand-rolling it 27 times (guess why?),
a print version of the ""ADOM Lite RPG"" (UPDATE 08/08/2012: buffed to 64 pages in size!!!) that contains a very simple but complete rules set for pen & paper RPG campaigns set in the world of Ancardia,

UPDATE 08/08/2012: a print version of the ""ADOM Lite RPG Arcana supplement"", a rules extension for the ADOM Lite RPG that will give you more than a dozen advanced and master classes for your PC and also provides a preview of what is to come in that regard in ADOM II and
a poster map of the Drakalor Chain again painted by Krzysztof Dycha
The Avatar of Thief pledge level will add the actual source code for the oldest released version of ADOM that still is contained in my source code repository to the CD (together with an NDA forbidding you distribute significant parts of said source code or using it for your own game - sorry, this is research-only).
You find the two new pledge levels in the section to the right!
Add $10 for shipping within Germany, $20 for shipping within Europe and $40 for the rest of the world (I know, that's high, but shipping costs from Germany are insane - I was shocked myself concerning the prices for packages :-( ). Shipping is included starting with the Legend level.
PLEDGE UPDATE #5: Fifth power pledge drive over!
The fifth and final power pledge drive: Arifacts netted a total of 32 (!) new items and 46 new artifacts to be added to the game. Wow :-) These totals have already been added to the total below.

PLEDGE UPDATE #1: First power pledge drive over!
Due to the amazing amount of pledges 12 new corruptions will be added to ADOM 1.2.0 and the corruption system itself will be even more randomized.
ABOUT THIS PROJECT
ADOM is one of the most successful roguelike games ever created, with downloads in the millions and many more every day. ADOM was the first roguelike to add a true role-playing experience to the roguelike genre, and boasts a brilliant mix of story, exploration, and intensely strategic and flexible combat. ADOM was in development from 1994 until November 2002, when the last build was released. ADOM is still part of the roguelike conversation, even after ten years of frozen development.

ADOM is primarily known for being the first roguelike to include vibrant towns, NPC dialog, and quests, but it offers more than just a rich story line in a complex fantasy world:

A huge game world with dozens of locations such as towns, randomized dungeons, and secrets
Loads of races and classes allowing for almost infinite play styles
Hundreds of monsters and items, many with enhanced random features
A corruption system forcing you to balance lust for power with fear of damnation
Spells, prayers, mindcraft, alchemy, and more
Dozens of quests and branching story lines
Numerous wildly different endings that might alter reality itself!
Sadly, although ADOM was highly polished, it was left in an unfinished state. Bugs, loopholes and other problems have been identified over the years, but I never had the resources to fix them. I believe I’ve found just the team of experienced, enthusiastic developers and artists to pick up where I left off and make ADOM something truly epic.
DEATH OR GLORY - I NEED YOUR HELP!
If this Indiegogo campaign is successful in reaching the funding goal, you will see a new release of ADOM, version 1.2.0. Here are some of the things you can expect:

New stable releases for all supported platforms (Windows, Linux, MacOS, Amiga, NetBSD, FreeBSD; Android and iPad/iOS are going to be stretch goals). Operating systems have evolved since 2002 and compatibility is becoming a serious issue.
Bug fixes for every bug we can find
Game balance patches
At least 12 new corruptions will be added to the corruption system.
45 new items will be added (but see below for that extra level).
46 new artifacts will be added (available as subsets per game, but see below for that extra level).
4 new monsters will be added (but see below for that extra level).
As a result of ""getting over with funding on August 22nd"" an extra special new boss monster with a special new map, 2 new artifacts, 4 new minion monsters for said boss and 16 new items that only will be recoverable on said special level are going to be added to the game.
More elaborate interaction for many things that are currently only handled superficially
UI improvements to bring ADOM up-to-date with the progress the roguelike genre has made, to be decided upon based on recommendations of players in the forums (e.g. colored message, some kind of auto-exploration and others)
A series of magical statues distributed across the dungeons
A roster of new named random boss monsters with special powers
Exciting new graphics for the title screen and some quest-related events
Audio for sound effects and music for the game areas and important events
A freshly revised manual
Honestly, I have very high hopes for ADOM. I’m keeping this campaign modest, but I have big ideas in case we surpass the goal. I‘ll be announcing the stretch goals later in the campaign, but let me give you a taste of what I have in mind. I‘m thinking at least two new races and classes, builds for Android and iOS, a scripting module for user extensions, and finally, the release of the ADOM source code as open source, with community management, building, and training included.
THE TEAM
An amazing team has gathered to support me in continuing the ADOM story. With your support, I’ll be adding Jochen Terstiege as co-developer, Krzysztof Dycha as the lead artist, and Oneiros Dieguez as lead composer and sound magician. All three will be involved and paid to help in reviving the development of ADOM.
Jochen has been following and supporting ADOM since the early days and has built many of the ports. I have known him for more than twenty years, and we have worked together in a professional environment for more than eight. Oneiros blew me away with his ability to create immersive sounds and compose memorable music. He is a professional musician by trade and has years of experience in the field. Krys is a talented computer artist who I met through the ADOM II community design competition, which he won. He has some great ideas for a new graphical user experience for the blog and the game. He's a professional artist and works with computer companies and studios.
WHY INVEST IN ME?
I have put many thousands of hours, if not tens of thousands, into ADOM development and shown my ability to produce an original and polished product, which has proved immensely popular. All this I did while asking only for postcards from fans, of which I have gratefully received a great many. Unfortunately, life has changed, and my goals exceed my resources. I'm calling on those who love the game and want to see it improved to invest to give ADOM the rebirth it deserves. I place tremendous value on ADOM, and I know its fans do too. Please put your faith in me and I will show you what a seasoned developer can do. ADOM will remain free, but your investment will help give it a new lease of life.
HOW DOES THIS CROWD FUNDING THING WORK?
Easy. You pledge an amount of money you choose (see the sidebar to the right). The pledge will be withdrawn from your account immediately. If the campaign fails to reach its goal and the minimum of $48,000 is not reached, your pledge will be refunded at the end of the campaign.
This is an all-or-nothing campaign. I do not believe in delivering inferior work with insufficient funds. Either enough money is raised to do an absolutely great job or we'll drop it, mourn, and get on with our lives. Your money only will be used if our goal is met. Otherwise, Indiegogo will refund your pledges at the end of the campaign.
HOW CAN YOU HELP?
First and foremost by pledging. Your contributions are the fuel this project needs to reach its goals. We can’t get anywhere without you. Donate today to get this train rolling!
And as importantly, by spreading the word and sharing the campaign via the Indiegogo tools, on social networks, blogs, forums--basically everywhere. Talk to friends and other gamers about it. Share the link. There once were hundreds of thousands of fans out there, if not millions, but many of them are not plugged in to the community and are hard for me to find. Let them know that today is the day!
LET’S MAKE THIS HAPPEN!
ADOM is in your hands. You are the ADOM tribe and you will determine the further fate of ADOM. You’ve been incredible supporters and friends, and I believe that with your help, we can create something truly memorable.",17.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p><br/></p></span></h4>
<h2><span class=""notranlsate""></span></h2>
<span class=""notranlsate"">Following the ""Trash Game of the Year 2012"", the one and only game that has ever scored 100% in a gamerarena rating, Homegrown Games is about to send adult gamers from all over the world ""Into the Ice"". We can´t promise you hookers yet, but rest assured that we will deliver Nazis, Nazi-Zombies, Boobies and ridiculous amounts of bad-taste gags, jokes and easter eggs. While the game will be rolled out on FPSC-R, the upcoming next generation of FPSC currently developed by TGC, we already have developed an internal Alpha that displays some of the new game mechanics. This was done with FPSC, but, again, we pushed the technical limits of the Engine a little bit further. Here you can see some of the new stuff in action:<br/><br/><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe height=""435"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/kF7Jw0YmY7I?feature=oembed"" width=""580""></iframe></div><br/>We are totally aware of the fact that most of the praise and glory we received for ""Into the Dark"" originated in the easter eggs, the pop culture references, the bad jokes, the tentacle sex experience and the vintage porn included. We know that the technical side of the game and the gameplay were mediocre at best.<br/><h3>We will change that - and we could need your help!</h3>
<p><br/><b>I won´t lie to you:</b><br/></p>
<p>We will make the game anyway, no matter how much funding we receive here. <br/></p>
<p><b>However, we NEED cash to improve the result!</b></p>
<p>The 2500 Euro asked for are a basic, but very important boost to the budget. For this cash, we get an additional workplace with PC, an additional Laptop and a good (but not high-end) voice recording equipement. <br/></p>
<p>2 additional internal testers or art freelancers would heavily improve variety, stability and fluence of the gameplay - and there are LOT of people asking to work at our studio in their spare time, many of them already employees of big game companies. <b>So, 2500 Euro can make a difference here.</b><br/></p>
<p>If we get more than 10.000,<i><b> I will train away 30-40 pounds, get my old film crew together again and make beautiful RL-B-Movie cutscenes</b></i> to be merged with the drawings. We did that with Anderson back in 2007, and it was actually the only thing in the game I am still proud of. <br/></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Glory to cheesyness:</p>

<br/></span></div>","Into the Ice - Sequel to the most successful and controversial Austrian indie game!


Following the ""Trash Game of the Year 2012"", the one and only game that has ever scored 100% in a gamerarena rating, Homegrown Games is about to send adult gamers from all over the world ""Into the Ice"". We can´t promise you hookers yet, but rest assured that we will deliver Nazis, Nazi-Zombies, Boobies and ridiculous amounts of bad-taste gags, jokes and easter eggs. While the game will be rolled out on FPSC-R, the upcoming next generation of FPSC currently developed by TGC, we already have developed an internal Alpha that displays some of the new game mechanics. This was done with FPSC, but, again, we pushed the technical limits of the Engine a little bit further. Here you can see some of the new stuff in action:We are totally aware of the fact that most of the praise and glory we received for ""Into the Dark"" originated in the easter eggs, the pop culture references, the bad jokes, the tentacle sex experience and the vintage porn included. We know that the technical side of the game and the gameplay were mediocre at best.We will change that - and we could need your help!
I won´t lie to you:
We will make the game anyway, no matter how much funding we receive here. 
However, we NEED cash to improve the result!
The 2500 Euro asked for are a basic, but very important boost to the budget. For this cash, we get an additional workplace with PC, an additional Laptop and a good (but not high-end) voice recording equipement. 
2 additional internal testers or art freelancers would heavily improve variety, stability and fluence of the gameplay - and there are LOT of people asking to work at our studio in their spare time, many of them already employees of big game companies. So, 2500 Euro can make a difference here.
If we get more than 10.000, I will train away 30-40 pounds, get my old film crew together again and make beautiful RL-B-Movie cutscenes to be merged with the drawings. We did that with Anderson back in 2007, and it was actually the only thing in the game I am still proud of. 
Glory to cheesyness:

And for every 25.000 Euro we get (well, that´s a high goal, but who knows?) I can afford to transform one freelancer into a full time artist or coder to work on the game.Needless to say, that this would also boost the games quality extremely!

We got the best perks ever.
This may sound exaggerated, but it´s not. During the last 10 years, I have worked occasionally with and for Austrian tourism authorities, skiing schools, noblemen, medieval societies.....oh, you ask what this has to do with our perks?
Well, if you go for one of the more expensive perks, we really send you...


This means, we send you skiing into the Austrian Alps. The best hotels, instructors (including former top racers) and latest equipement included. Also, there are weeks among knights and noblemen on original castles available. And if you spread your wallet like Babylon her legs, we can even get you knighted. 


Of course we have also all the usual perks that game developers offer: Alpha access, bundles, physical copies, Desura keys, guest star roles in the game.Take your time and browse the perks!
And now some really important words:

We are neither wannabe-game-designers who try to raise cash for their first game, nor has-been ""industry legends"" trying to get back on their feet. My Mobygames track record includes 25+ worldwide shipped games. I know what I am doing.

The main reason we raise money here is that by all means, ""Into the Ice"" MUST REMAIN INDIE. We already have two offers by publishers. But signing with them would mean heavy cencorship and sacrifying the freedom to really make an UNIQUE game.

Every game developement has its risk. But the only possibility this game will never see the light would be an unexpected death on my side. I don´t intend to have a heart attack or fatal accident soon, and the risk of being swallowed by a three-headed-monkey should be pretty low as long as I don´t go looking for Guybrush.

If you ask yourself ""If Into the Dark was so successful, why do you need additional money?"", you are pretty smart. And perfectly right. However, from 2008 to 2011 three different companies we were working for filed for bankruptcy. I lost over 120.000 Dollar in unpayed invoices, and Homegrown Games almost went out of business.

<p>Hello everyone, my name is Thomas Cheung. I am a graphic artist, designer, gamer and duelist (Yu-Gi-Oh! card game player). I am new to the scene of design, but I have been learning and doing it for 4-5 years.</p>
<p><br/>I love the card game of Yu-Gi-Oh! and that is why I started to do this campaign. I have seen many duelist calculator apps out there that offers all the little gadgets needed to play the game. Many of these apps make the players adapt to them rather than letting players customize it to their preference. I want to create a tool that is used by all players with a smartphone and I want it to become the ""goto"" app when people are playing the game.</p>
<p>By contributing to me, I can cover the cost of making it and share the app to the world for free, also it will be advertisement free and potentially port it to Android, so that I am not limited to just one set of devices.</p>
<h3>FUNDING</h3>
<p>I am asking for C$ 1000 to fund my app. Most of the money will be going towards coding, designing the UI and graphics, and researching potential features that the others may have missed. If there are more features to be added, I will be hosting multiple test groups to see which design is preferred. The funds will also go towards acquiring test devices to check the compatibility for a wider range of devices.</p>
<p>If my funding does not reach my goal, the funds will continue to go towards the equipment, software and testing. I will continue to release the app for the Yu-Gi-Oh! community out there.</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>PERKS</h3>
<p>25+: You can get a chance to put your name or company name in the app for supporting. This maybe a chance for you to make this the official app for your store. (*Potential tester)</p>
<p>100+: I know all players love to protect their valuble cards, so I will also send them a play mat designed by me to show you supported this cause. If you have a great idea about a design, you can share it to me and I will design it and give you the recognition.</p>
<p>250+: If you contributed as a group this is for you. 4 custom play mats (you send the design and I will have it made). You can send me 2 ideas on a skin and I design it for you and have it available in the app.</p>

<p><strong>Artipia Games</strong> proudly presents <strong>Among the Stars.</strong> A new card drafting game by Greek designer <strong>Vangelis Bagiartakis</strong>.</p>
<p><em>After a devastating war, peace is declared among all the major races of the galaxy and an Alliance is created to face a mutual threat.</em></p>
<p><em>One of the first decisions of the Alliance, is to build space stations all along the galaxy in order to promote trade among the races, strengthen diplomatic relations and help keep the newly established peace.</em></p>
<p><em>Each player takes the role of one of those races, trying to build the best space station.</em></p>
<p>Players use a card drafting mechanism, select location cards and place them on their station. According to where they place them, they score victory points. The construction lasts 4 rounds and whoever has the most points in the end wins.</p>

<p> </p>
<p><strong>Among the Stars</strong> uses a  card drafting mechanism.</p>
<p>The game is played in 4 rounds (each round represents 1 year of construction). Each round every player receives 6 location cards. During each turn all the players at the same time, select a location card from their hand and pass the remaining cards to the next player. Then each player, can do 1 of 3 things with the location card he chose:</p>
<ol>
<li>Build it in his Station by paying the required credit and/or energy cost (forming a grid on the table)</li>
<li>Discard it to earn credits</li>
<li>Convert is to a Power Reactor in order to increase the Station's energy</li>
</ol>
<div>When built, each location offers some Victory Points. Based on where the location card is placed it can offer more Victory Points through each card's ability. At the end of the game, players also score points for all the end-game abilities of their cards (yellow background).</div>
<div> </div>
<div>After 4 rounds the player with the most Victory Points is the winner.</div>
<div> </div>
</div>
</div>
<div><span><strong> </strong></span></div>
<div><span><strong> </strong></span></div>
<div><span><strong>LOCATION CARDS</strong></span></div>
<div> </div>
<div>Each location card has a building cost and offers Victory Points which almost always vary based on where the player will choose to build it in his Station.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Here are a few examples:</div>
<div><img alt=""Crew Quarters Location Card"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.artipiagames.com/indiegogo/ats_crewquarters.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></div>

</div>
<div> </div>
<div> </div>
<div>
<strong>Power Reactors </strong>provide players with the energy needed to expand their Station. Each Reactor offers 2 more Energy cubes which can be used to build locations in a distance of 2 around the Reactor.</div>
<div><strong> </strong></div>
<div><strong><img alt=""Power Reactor Card"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.artipiagames.com/indiegogo/ats_reactor.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></strong></div>
<div><strong> </strong></div>
<div><strong> </strong></div>
<div><strong> </strong></div>
<div><strong>CONFLICT CARDS</strong></div>
<div><strong> </strong></div>
<div>Conflict cards are used in the ""Aggressive Mode"" of the game and increase interaction between players. These cards are shuffled together with the location cards but this time each player is dealt 7 cards during each round. When a player chooses to play a Conflict card, he must pay 1 credit. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>A player can always discard a Conflict card for credits or convert it to a Power Reactor instead of playing it.</div>

<p><strong>1) I just made my contribution on a perk with more than one options. How will Artipia know which game(s) I pre-ordered?</strong></p>
<p>Once our funding goal is met, we will contact you via email to verify your postal address and which games you have pre-ordered.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>2) I made a contribution and later on a friend wanted to join in. How can I get the discount of a Combo Pack or Artipia Pack ?</strong></p>
<p>You can use the ""<strong>Perk Upgrade</strong>"" perk and contribute the remaining amount.</p>
<p><em>Example: You pre-ordered Among the Stars by contributing $55. A friend later tells you he wants to pre-order Briefcase. You can use the ""<strong>Perk Upgrade</strong>""<strong> </strong>perk and contribute another $45. This way you would each get -$5 on your games.</em>  </p>

<div><span>                                           © 2012 Artipia Games. All rights reserved.</span></div></div>","Artipia Games proudly presents Among the Stars. A new card drafting game by Greek designer Vangelis Bagiartakis.
After a devastating war, peace is declared among all the major races of the galaxy and an Alliance is created to face a mutual threat.
One of the first decisions of the Alliance, is to build space stations all along the galaxy in order to promote trade among the races, strengthen diplomatic relations and help keep the newly established peace.
Each player takes the role of one of those races, trying to build the best space station.
Players use a card drafting mechanism, select location cards and place them on their station. According to where they place them, they score victory points. The construction lasts 4 rounds and whoever has the most points in the end wins.


 
 
 
Our main goal is to raise $8,000. We have a busy and ambitious production schedule for 2012 and your contributions will help us bring this game to life.
 

 
 
 
The English version of the Among the Stars rulebook can be downloaded by clicking on the link below:
http://www.artipiagames.com/ats/rules/Among_The_Stars_ENG_Rulebook.pdf
 



 
 


 
 
Inside the box you will find:

English Rulebook

4 Main Reactor cards (Square 7x7cm)


72 Basic Location cards (Square 7x7cm)
44 Special Location cards (Square 7x7cm)

12 Power Reactor cards (Square 7x7cm)

8 Objective cards (Square 7x7cm)
12 Conflict cards (Square 7x7cm)
8 Racial Abilities (8x5cm punched board)
1 Score Board (16.8cm x 26cm)
4 Player marker hexes (punched board)
1 Turn marker hex (punched board)
32 1-credit tokens (punched board)
12 5-credit tokens (punched board)
30 Energy Cubes (Tranparent Plastic 1.2x1.2x1.2cm)
Ziplock PE-Bags






 
 
 
Among the Stars uses a  card drafting mechanism.
The game is played in 4 rounds (each round represents 1 year of construction). Each round every player receives 6 location cards. During each turn all the players at the same time, select a location card from their hand and pass the remaining cards to the next player. Then each player, can do 1 of 3 things with the location card he chose:

Build it in his Station by paying the required credit and/or energy cost (forming a grid on the table)
Discard it to earn credits
Convert is to a Power Reactor in order to increase the Station's energy

When built, each location offers some Victory Points. Based on where the location card is placed it can offer more Victory Points through each card's ability. At the end of the game, players also score points for all the end-game abilities of their cards (yellow background).
 
After 4 rounds the player with the most Victory Points is the winner.
 


 
 
LOCATION CARDS
 
Each location card has a building cost and offers Victory Points which almost always vary based on where the player will choose to build it in his Station.
 
Here are a few examples:




 
 

Power Reactors provide players with the energy needed to expand their Station. Each Reactor offers 2 more Energy cubes which can be used to build locations in a distance of 2 around the Reactor.
 

 
 
 
CONFLICT CARDS
 
Conflict cards are used in the ""Aggressive Mode"" of the game and increase interaction between players. These cards are shuffled together with the location cards but this time each player is dealt 7 cards during each round. When a player chooses to play a Conflict card, he must pay 1 credit. 
 
A player can always discard a Conflict card for credits or convert it to a Power Reactor instead of playing it.
 

 
 
 
RACIAL ABILITIES
 

In Among the Stars each player takes over the role of an alien race. Each race has a different special ability which gives the player an advantage during the game.
 

 
Here is some concept art of some for the alien races.
 



 
 
OBJECTIVES
 
Objective card reward players with additional Victory Points by the end of the game for achieving specific goals.

<p></p>
<p>Le jeu reste simple, mais son intérêt réside dans son côté ludique et drôle, et grâce à l'évolution du jeu ( veau→taureau ). Celui-ci n'est pas ennuyeux, bien au contraire, il devient de plus en plus intéressant en avançant dans le jeu.</p>
<p>Le jeu a été imaginé dans le but que tout le monde puisse y jouer.<br/>Les actions qui permettent de jouer et d'avancer dans le jeu sont simples. </p>

<p></p>
<p>Pour diriger votre taureau, il vous suffit de faire glisser votre doigt sur votre téléphone ou votre tablette vers la droite ou la gauche.</p>
<p>Lorsque votre taureau bouscule une personne grâce à ses cornes, vous pouvez envoyer la personne dans la direction que vous voulez afin de détruire un ou des éléments du décor qui vous permettra d'activer des bonus cachés. </p>

<p></p>
<p>Le bonus de rage se cumule en bousculant les passants. Plus il y aura de passants à se mettre sur le chemin de votre taureau, plus celui-ci sera en colère. La jauge en bas à gauche (la tête de taureau) devient de plus en plus rouge jusqu'à la rage complète qui permet de déclencher une charge pendant un temps donné. Cette charge vous permet de renverser les toreros, les véhicules, les éléments du décor ainsi que de détruire des vitrines qui vous donnent accès à des passages secrets.  </p>
<p>Pour activer la charge, il suffit de taper une fois sur l'écran. A droite de l’écran pour envoyer les personnes à droite et à gauche de l'écran pour les envoyer à gauche. </p>

<p>La santé du taureau diminue d'un point à chaque fois qu'il a touché un obstacle qu'il n'a pas pu éviter. Lorsqu'il rencontre un torero, celui-ci va essayer de lui planter une banderille, il faudra l'éviter ou le charger si le bonus de rage est suffisant. La banderille reste plantée pendant tout la durée de la partie et elle influe sur les points de vie de l'animal. La course de votre taureau devient plus laborieuse au fur et à mesure que sa santé diminue et l’écran devient de plus en plus rouge. </p>
<p>Les plus jeunes ou moins jeunes y trouveront même un intérêt éducatif, grâce à de petites fiches instructives sur le taureau et/ou le monde du taureau qui apparaîtront entre chaque partie de jeu gagnée.</p>

Aucun jeu digne de ce nom sur le monde du taureau n'existait jusqu’à présent, nous avons voulu combler cette lacune .

Voilà les points qui pourraient caractériser le jeu ""Free Bulls"" :


Se détendre.
S'amuser.
Se défouler. 
Apprendre.








""FREE BULLS"" UN JEU DE TYPE RUNER GAMES.
Le jeu ""Free Bulls"" a été créé  sur une des bases de jeu les plus anciennes. Il s'agit d'un jeu de type runner games, jouable de 7 à 77 ans. Le jeu est téléchargeable gratuitement. 

Le Pitch
Vous êtes un taureau que l'on devait amener à une corrida, vous réussissez à vous échapper et vous vous retrouvez dans la ville. Le but du jeu étant de sortir de cette ville sans trop de dommage. Il faudra éviter les véhicules dans le trafic, ainsi que les personnes qui veulent vous arrêter ou vous blesser.
Pour ce faire, plusieurs option s'offre à vous  :


Eviter les véhicules (bus et voitures)
Eviter les toreros qui cherchent à vous blesser.
Renverser les gens dans la rue (gain d'argent et de points) . 
Renverser les véhicules et les toreros grâce à des charges accumulées pendant le jeu.



Petit veau deviendra grand ...

Le jeu est évolutif dans le temps. Vous commencez à jouer en étant un tout jeune veau. Ensuite vous évoluez jusqu'à devenir un taureau grand et fort.
Vous faites évoluer votre taureau en cumulant des points acquis dans la partie. Un certain nombre de points doit être obtenu pour faire grandir votre taureau.

Différents niveaux d'évolution du taureau : 


Añojo  (jeune veau)              Nombre de vies : 3            Bonus de rage : 0%

Eral  (veau)                              Nombre de vies : 3           Bonus de rage : 5%
Becerro  (taurillon)               Nombre de vies : 4           Bonus de rage : 10%
Novillo  (jeune taureau)      Nombre de vies : 4            Bonus de rage : 15%
Toro  (taureau adulte)         Nombre de vies : 5            Bonus de rage : 20%








Jouer facilement et rapidement.

Le jeu reste simple, mais son intérêt réside dans son côté ludique et drôle, et grâce à l'évolution du jeu ( veau→taureau ). Celui-ci n'est pas ennuyeux, bien au contraire, il devient de plus en plus intéressant en avançant dans le jeu.
Le jeu a été imaginé dans le but que tout le monde puisse y jouer.Les actions qui permettent de jouer et d'avancer dans le jeu sont simples. 


Diriger votre taureau.

Pour diriger votre taureau, il vous suffit de faire glisser votre doigt sur votre téléphone ou votre tablette vers la droite ou la gauche.
Lorsque votre taureau bouscule une personne grâce à ses cornes, vous pouvez envoyer la personne dans la direction que vous voulez afin de détruire un ou des éléments du décor qui vous permettra d'activer des bonus cachés. 



Bonus de rage

Le bonus de rage se cumule en bousculant les passants. Plus il y aura de passants à se mettre sur le chemin de votre taureau, plus celui-ci sera en colère. La jauge en bas à gauche (la tête de taureau) devient de plus en plus rouge jusqu'à la rage complète qui permet de déclencher une charge pendant un temps donné. Cette charge vous permet de renverser les toreros, les véhicules, les éléments du décor ainsi que de détruire des vitrines qui vous donnent accès à des passages secrets.  
Pour activer la charge, il suffit de taper une fois sur l'écran. A droite de l’écran pour envoyer les personnes à droite et à gauche de l'écran pour les envoyer à gauche. 

 



Points de vie. 


La santé du taureau diminue d'un point à chaque fois qu'il a touché un obstacle qu'il n'a pas pu éviter. Lorsqu'il rencontre un torero, celui-ci va essayer de lui planter une banderille, il faudra l'éviter ou le charger si le bonus de rage est suffisant. La banderille reste plantée pendant tout la durée de la partie et elle influe sur les points de vie de l'animal. La course de votre taureau devient plus laborieuse au fur et à mesure que sa santé diminue et l’écran devient de plus en plus rouge. 
Les plus jeunes ou moins jeunes y trouveront même un intérêt éducatif, grâce à de petites fiches instructives sur le taureau et/ou le monde du taureau qui apparaîtront entre chaque partie de jeu gagnée.


Course effréné à travers la  ville.

La course vers la liberté de votre taureau se passe en ville. Le décor défile dans le sens vertical de haut en bas. Plus vous avancez dans le jeu, plus les obstacles rencontrés sont hostiles (traversée de route, voies rapides, tramway etc...). Certains décors hors de portée pour le taureau peuvent tout de même être détruits en envoyant les passants sur ces objets à l'aide des cornes. 
A certains moments du parcours, le jeu vous donne la possibilité de passer à travers une vitrine ou un mur craquelé pour descendre dans le métro ou un centre commercial afin d'éviter certains obstacles quand la charge n'est pas disponible. Le joueur peut ainsi souffler un instant et ne pas rencontrer d'obstacle pénalisant pendant un court instant.



Toreros. Lors du passage du taureau, les toreros ne vont pas essayer de l'éviter, ils vont au contraire essayer de lui planter une banderilles dans le dos. Le seul moyen d'éviter ça, c'est d'esquiver son attaque ou passer à travers, si la charge est disponible.

Le jeu a une base de 45.000€, ensuite plusieurs options s'offrent à vous. Elles se décomposent de la manière suivante :
45.000 € pour le jeu de base

65.000 € avec option de niveau (niveau métro)

The EPIC game play has remained the same!BUT WHY SMALLER!?Simply put, we're making this version to hopefully land Tiny Epic Kingdoms on a mass market shelf while offering some of our previous KS backers a chance at a neat utility. Either as a gift, or as a pocket game, we feel UTEK really delivers! We believe it could be an effective gateway game at this size and price. We're trying to find a new market with this version of the game, but wanted to give our Kickstarter backers an early chance at it. Considering there will be some that really appreciate the opportunity, and we feel as they helped build this series, that we owe it to them. If you already own Tiny Epic Kingdoms, this may not be for you, but it would make for a great stocking stuffer for a friend, and a lot our backers have expressed an interest in that. This is NOT something we are doing to all the Tiny Epic games, and this is NOT the direction of the Tiny Epic series. This is essentially just an attempt at a mass-market calling card and we're using our first TE title because it lends itself very well to this Ultra-Tiny format.So if you are a long-term Tiny Epic backer, don't feel bad if you pass on this, we understand.We also appreciate your understanding of our dream to bring Tiny Epic games to more people and more markets. All THIS for only $9! (+shipping)
The BASE version includes all 16 original Factions! A DELUXE copy of Ultra-Tiny Epic Kingdoms includes everything from the BASE game, PLUS, a high-quality DRAW BAG and BOX SLEEVE! These are helpful in preserving and improving the product's longevity. ***Limited Exclusivity - Deluxe content will not enter regular distribution. However, it may be available in limited supply at conventions, through contests, online at the BGG promo store, and directly from Gamelyn Games. LEARN TEK AND YOU'VE LEARNED UTEK!Ultra-Tiny Epic Kingdoms and Tiny Epic Kingdoms are virtually the same game. The only rule difference between the two versions is how units react to the Ruins region and certain faction/territory restrictions exist due to having them back to back on the cards. Otherwise you can expect the same EPIC game experience from TEK to come from UTEK! With SOLO play included! You've seen how great the game is, but now let us prove it to you!Follow the links below to find a FREE Print & Play of Tiny Epic Kingdoms.Note: the rule book is also a separate download.  Click HERE for the Print 'N Play Games Files  Click HERE for the Print 'N Play Rulebook Tiny Epic Kingdoms is a Golden Geek award winning 4x game that has sold over 20,000 copies worldwide! Check out our original Kickstarter project for TEK HERE. We have set out on a mission to bring this great game to mass-market, and UTEK is our vessel! With a card sized box, an MSRP of $10, and resonating game play, we feel UTEK will stand out, and even excel, among other games at this price point and size.We've even designed a catchy point-of-purchase display box to help facilitate retail sales.  To learn more about the game play of Tiny Epic Kingdoms, check out this video: Putting UTEK back into the box!
 This project is short, sweet, and simple. It is an already complete game and will not feature more than a few planned stretch goals. Adding any unplanned stretch goals will cause a delay in delivery and may impede production. Thank you for your understanding and support.The funding raised in the Kickstarter campaign (see below), will contribute to reaching the following stretch goals. 


  

 

 

 For MAXIMUM EXPOSURE we running a simultaneous project on Kickstarter for the same duration. The Kickstarter project funding will be considered toward unlocking stretch goals, and is our main focus, but you may pledge on either site.

<h3>The Best Games I Have Created</h3>
<p>Since I started West Aries Games last year, I have worked hard on making games of various types. Most of the games I have created have been triggered by different events in my life.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1470145098/plhdw2ppjrunvaectmpi.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><strong><a href=""https://www.thegamecrafter.com/games/crisis-averted:-ultimate-edition"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Crisis Averted</a> </strong>was my first game, actually my only game to not get funded through Kickstarter. I created this game while doing a podcast which focuses on comic book characters, the Hero Heads Podcast. Without having the money for licensing I decided to make the game generic, maybe a little too generic.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1470144814/hs2x8596lbclsyzsnvcf.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>When I made the <a href=""https://www.thegamecrafter.com/games/reclaim-oz-reclaim-neverland"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>Reclaim Series</strong></a>, which is based off children's literature, it was just around the time that I started reading those same stories to my now three year old. It was a game that was originally set in Magical Land of Oz and through the sequel took us all the way to Peter Pan's Neverland.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1470144764/hsooj4w3o32bevhlrpfg.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>These two games were not my 'big ones' that made me decide that this is something worth pursuing, I consider those games my 'baby steps' into developing my best games. These titles, along with others are available on my <a href=""https://www.thegamecrafter.com/designers/west-aries-games"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">GameCrafter</a> page, however for this campaign I want to talk about the games that have brought me the most success. So let's talk about the games I am offering in this campaign on Indiegogo.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1470145171/cgi4wnywwbhwd9impvpy.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><a href=""http://westaries.wixsite.com/productions/west-aries-games"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>RePresidency</strong></a> came about during the discussions of the upcoming election and the notion that we live in a different world than from previous elections. As much as I liked doing a game involving politics, I enjoyed the history more than anything. If Capitalism, USA could be compared closely to any of my games, RePresidency is the most similar. But instead of trying to get votes, you are trying to get money! A sequel,<strong> <a href=""http://westaries.wixsite.com/productions/west-aries-games"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">RePresidency: Civil War</a></strong> was later launched and funded a year after the original which focused on the Election and Events leading up to the American Civil War.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1470144708/sttrb2dvqkf9rvbeodyr.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><strong><a href=""http://westaries.wixsite.com/productions/west-aries-games"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Relative Paradox</a> </strong>was created because I have always been a fan of the Doctor, so delved into the realm of Time Travel. This was the game that used history to its fullest extent. Overall the world of the game was extremely broad, the earth has been around an awfully long time so the game takes place in several periods throughout world history.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1470144667/pvwcc6tvmeygvldib8cq.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><a href=""http://westaries.wixsite.com/productions/west-aries-games"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>Capitalism, USA</strong></a> launched during the 2016 Primary and was a huge success. Playing a game of business with a hint of politics was very topical during this time. It was the first game I designed that used 'play money' and has been compared to Monopoly on several occasions. The styles of the games are completely different but I was honored to even be in the shadow of such a monumental franchise. </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1470144631/xu57pgzm5yzutpwmyiff.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>I want to be able to offer all of my games to the<strong> Indiegogo Community</strong> to see if there is any interest in the games I developed. Other crowdfunding platforms are heavily armed with celebrity projects and those with a larger voice than my own. I consider Indiegogo my last hope in determining if my dreams are worth pursuing. </p>
<h3><a href=""https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/westaries/capitalism-usa-the-game-of-greed?ref=user_menu"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Capitalism, USA: A Game of Greed</a></h3>
<p>A game based on power and influence throughout American History. Grow your wealth, rise to power, and eliminate all.</p>
<p>1. Each player is dealt FIVE Workforce cards, these will represent your workers of your new company. Place them face up, showing the occupation, in front of you for the remainder of the game.<br/><br/>2. Each player will collect their starting funds of $50,000 place the remainder of the currency in the middle of the table, this is the General Fund.<br/><br/>3. Each player is dealt FIVE cards from the Main Deck, one of these cards must be used each turn through the game and earn/lose money. Place the remaining cards from the Main Deck on the table.<br/><br/>4. Take turns playing a single card from the Main Deck, once you play a card, draw another.<br/><br/>5. The game ends once a player has flipped all FIVE Workforce cards to Profit and Progress.

<p>Thank you,</p>
<p>RH</p>
</div></div>","The Best Games I Have Created
Since I started West Aries Games last year, I have worked hard on making games of various types. Most of the games I have created have been triggered by different events in my life.

Crisis Averted was my first game, actually my only game to not get funded through Kickstarter. I created this game while doing a podcast which focuses on comic book characters, the Hero Heads Podcast. Without having the money for licensing I decided to make the game generic, maybe a little too generic.

When I made the Reclaim Series, which is based off children's literature, it was just around the time that I started reading those same stories to my now three year old. It was a game that was originally set in Magical Land of Oz and through the sequel took us all the way to Peter Pan's Neverland.

These two games were not my 'big ones' that made me decide that this is something worth pursuing, I consider those games my 'baby steps' into developing my best games. These titles, along with others are available on my GameCrafter page, however for this campaign I want to talk about the games that have brought me the most success. So let's talk about the games I am offering in this campaign on Indiegogo.

RePresidency came about during the discussions of the upcoming election and the notion that we live in a different world than from previous elections. As much as I liked doing a game involving politics, I enjoyed the history more than anything. If Capitalism, USA could be compared closely to any of my games, RePresidency is the most similar. But instead of trying to get votes, you are trying to get money! A sequel, RePresidency: Civil War was later launched and funded a year after the original which focused on the Election and Events leading up to the American Civil War.

Relative Paradox was created because I have always been a fan of the Doctor, so delved into the realm of Time Travel. This was the game that used history to its fullest extent. Overall the world of the game was extremely broad, the earth has been around an awfully long time so the game takes place in several periods throughout world history.

Capitalism, USA launched during the 2016 Primary and was a huge success. Playing a game of business with a hint of politics was very topical during this time. It was the first game I designed that used 'play money' and has been compared to Monopoly on several occasions. The styles of the games are completely different but I was honored to even be in the shadow of such a monumental franchise. 

I want to be able to offer all of my games to the Indiegogo Community to see if there is any interest in the games I developed. Other crowdfunding platforms are heavily armed with celebrity projects and those with a larger voice than my own. I consider Indiegogo my last hope in determining if my dreams are worth pursuing. 
Capitalism, USA: A Game of Greed
A game based on power and influence throughout American History. Grow your wealth, rise to power, and eliminate all.
1. Each player is dealt FIVE Workforce cards, these will represent your workers of your new company. Place them face up, showing the occupation, in front of you for the remainder of the game.2. Each player will collect their starting funds of $50,000 place the remainder of the currency in the middle of the table, this is the General Fund.3. Each player is dealt FIVE cards from the Main Deck, one of these cards must be used each turn through the game and earn/lose money. Place the remaining cards from the Main Deck on the table.4. Take turns playing a single card from the Main Deck, once you play a card, draw another.5. The game ends once a player has flipped all FIVE Workforce cards to Profit and Progress. The player with the most money is the winner. You are all billionaire industrialists that are taking on a new business in Capitalism USA, seeking residence, it is your goal to obtain the most money before one player reaches a completely their full potential of Profit and Progress


 


RePresidency: Election Edition
My largest game and the one that continues to be my favorite.

2 to 8 players will have a chance to become president once again. 50 States and the District of Columbia that make up our Electoral College, the goal of the game is to win states and get the most votes. Each player will be dealt a total of three candidate cards--these will include 24 of our nations most influential Presidents throughout history. From those cards you will choose one candidate and that will be yours for the remainder of the game. Not all candidates will be able to gain states as easily as others, the 'Political Cause' cards can help get a candidate Electoral Votes that they normally could not get just on merit alone.
Throughout your turns; you will gain Political Allies and use their Historical Influence to gain States (each worth different Electoral Votes) and to assist in becoming the next President. You will have to come up with the best strategy to ensure you get the most votes to beat your opponents.
Consisting of a 108 Distinctive Card Deck, this game gives us a look into the Election Process unlike any game has done before. You must defend your Candidate from the the Political Causes that other Candidates may use, defeat the odds stacked up against you in states without the same political views, win the electoral vote by as many votes as possible, and serve Four More Years as President of the United States!

Relative Paradox: Time Travel on the Tabletop
A Tabletop Game that sends you through time and space; to restore the timeline before the result of a Paradox.

The game could best be described as a Deck Building Game, with other mechanics that include Strategy, Hand Management, and some Luck. The game is designed using characters from the book Relative Paradox by Dexter Ames, in combination with some of the most influential moments in human history. It is your task to match up the points in history to restore the timeline that has been shattered by the events in the book.
2 to 8 Players will take their Traveler into Time and Space to collect pieces of history and put them back together. First players will be dealt one time traveler to represent them during the game; these are Time Traveler Cards. The Traveler you are dealt is who you will represent throughout the game. Then each player is Dealt Five Cards from the main deck, seperating the remainder into three piles and a card is placed face up on all sides (see the image above), these cards are now obtainable. 
Each turn you can either create a timeline (matching cards with same symbols) or draw a card from the tabletop that is obtainable. When you make a pair, you draw to replenish, ending your turn--this continues until the end of the game. Also please note, if you have a timeline available to lay--you must use it and lay your pair/three of a kind face up in front of you. Each Timeline Card will have a value that will count toward your final tally; these are called Timeline Points. Each Traveler interacts with a particular timeline differently, giving them bonus Timeline Points when playing specific events or people. 
When a Paradox is turned, it takes a space on the 'obtainable timeline' but once it is set two things happen. Whatever combination listed is now playable by all Time Traveller's and secondly that space is now closed. There are eight places that are obtainable--once all eight paradoxes are turned, the timeline is fractured completely and the game ends.

<p>Hi I'm Katie Riverwood, head of- TallStory Studios. As you may know, the road to this point has been very tough, financially, and the big learning curve. This is the first game for the studio and for me. I have no idea where this campaign will leave the game, but i hold my fingers crossed.<br/></p>Its incredible what the money will do for GoV. The sounds, voice acting, animation, all equating to excellent story telling! Something this game really deserves. In terms of gameplay, i've already nearly nailed it, and im so proud that THIS is my first game, a real coming together of small pockets of great talent in different parts of the world. Most people told me to do a simple game, where characters are boxes. But who wants to stay inside a box? I dreamt of swift swooshes of swords, bullets flying through the air, and a little girl caught in the wind, gliding with her umbrella.<br/><br/>One thing I always really wanted to get across with the game, is that dispute the rushing, the combat, the bits of blood... is elegance. I want the players to feel that when they're gliding, they're really gliding with style, and enjoy those few moments that might feel away from the chaos. Right now perhaps, they're just characters you move, with a little back story you read. But I want to say- yes it's 2D, and yes it's a platformer, but push the uniqueness level further by making the characters seem more real, having Ripper shout some Voldemort-like comment to the player from a-far about how he will catch you, and having Zeal reply under venomous breathe.<br/><br/>I have also loved the varying degree of styles you can get in cut-scene animations. Some of my favourites in 2D have been Alice Madness Returns and Valiant Hearts. Cut-scenes for a game like GoV should also be earnt. So not just completing a level, but collecting everything in it, would trigger a scene to continue the story. To create an A to B progression rather than a selection of missions.<br/><br/>We have companies and developers asking to be a part of bundles with Guardians of Victoria all the time. We just need you gamers to get involved! So thank you for taking the time to come here and look.<br/><p></p>

</div></div>","An overview of the game:Guardians of Victoria is a Steampunk, story-book running game with multiple twists, taking 
conventional running gameplay and creating something unique! Testing 
your reactions, planning, and timing in an action-packed multi-tasking 
race to the end without being caught by Jack the Ripper.The game is set for release in October 2015.
 However if we achieve some big stretch goals! We predict the 
game to be released some time later. The game will initially be released
 on PC, and you can find our Greenlight page at the bottom, but should we raise enough, the game will be on Android and IOS too! With potential for console releases based on interest and feedback from Early Access.If you want to play Guardians of Victoria before backing- you can! Just buy the Early Access version of the game when it is released. You can see all the progress at www.tallstorystudios.com aswell.P.S This is a Greenlit game!


Play
 as the Guardians as they fight their way through the Steampunk city in 
the clouds, collecting items and defeating the allies of the 
ever-chasing destroyer- Jack the Ripper. You must build the portal to his lair using expert skill and determination!


The game features:



Free-Roaming: Unlike most running games you can actually stop, 
run left, and climb, allowing you to explore the environment a bit more.

    Racing against a chaser: To keep you moving along and 
fighting tooth and nail, The Ripper chases with his 
giant cloud of thunder. You can use players abilities to mess with his speed and 
get a little boost away. The higher the difficulty- the faster he moves. Be wary though, as Ripper can shoot electric bolts, warp your screen, and will drop enemies around you!


 Using mechanics:
 To keep you in the sky, help you reach items you can't jump to, and keep you healthy and living, you must avoid gas leaks, control crane 
platforms, put out fires, and more!



 Multi-characters: There are three characters with their own uniquely designed levels across various locations. Brella, Cutlass, and Firearm- members of the Guardians. The leader of the Guardians, a flying robot called Zeal, also follows the characters on their missions. Each character has their own special abilities, back-story, personality, platforming ability (such as Brella using her umbrella to glide), and hopefully voice acting! Read more below!

 Special abilities:
 Utilise each characters abilities by collecting the fireflies for their
 dust around the city, for slowing down time, beefing up combat and 
more!


 Tactical fast combat: Each character has a very unique fighting style. You can test them out in the arena/tutorial area, and really be tested in the city.
 Multiple replayable levels: Platform your way across many levels including ‘The Factory’, and ‘The Rooftops’. Each level features 3 different difficulty star ratings and a timer system! Complete levels by collecting every collectable of a difficulty, and surviving to the portal at the end.



 Collect the items- defeat Ripper:
 Every level has cogs and other mechanical miscellanea hidden about. Collect them all and build the 
machine in the menu, that will take you to Ripper once and for all! Squeeze 
in time between running to look for them, even if it means breaking a 
few windows.
 Indoor running: Forget 
traditional rooftop running! Run indoors too! Some floating buildings 
can be entered! Jump in through windows or tunnels or use and find the secrets 
within!



 Steam bonuses: Steam users will also collect achievements and trading cards. 

Extra levels: The game also features an arena with character selection, and a combat and platforming tutorial. Levels will be diverse to include things such as ship flying levels!









To take a look at the other characters in action (some old animations)- take a look at the old trailer from early last month.
Character profiles:
Play as Brella, Cutlass, and Firearm- three members of the Guardians, protectors of the city of Victoria. Each has their own powerful and incredibly important special ability, from freezing time around them, to destroying groups of enemies, powered by the fireflies flying around the city. Not only that, but every character has their own, unique combat set, and platforming abilities.


Brella
Our youngest member of the team, raised by Zeal after being found as a sky orphan. Named Brella for her skills with her umbrella, she can slow down time, slowing down the chasing Ripper as he tries to catch them.

Special Ability: Slowing down time all around her, from falling 
platforms, to the Ripper, to the attacking enemies. Useful in tight 
situations. The more firefly dust collected, the longer the freeze! 
 Combat: Use her to damage multiple, surrounding enemies, as she swings her umbrella around in a twirl at great speed. 

Platforming Skill: Gliding. Brella harnesses her multi-use umbrella, to glide her over further distances.



 



Cutlass
Cutlass is a sky-pirate, who happened upon the
 city after her own ship arrived months before. Thief of the sky, 
Cutlass had a reputation of pillaging and being deadly dangerous with a sword and magic, but the Guardians gave her purpose.

Platforming Skill: Accustomed to the crows nests, she can jump high, fast and can double-jump.

    Special Ability: Using the dust she collects, at the flick of
 her fingers, she can explode the air meters in-front of her, enough to 
destroy a few troublesome enemies approaching, as it was destroying some
 enemy ships!
 Combat: Use her famed cutlass sword to strike down enemies in one on one combat with deadly speed. 



 




Firearm
The ex-bachelor was claimed by Ripper's drugs, the 
self-proclaimed gentleman of the team, Firearm was recruited by Zeal to slowly claw his way through Ripper's disciples. Half mechanised from disabilities caused by the drugs, he was fixed by the team. Firearm is deadly fast, and deadly accurate with a pistol.
 Combat: Firearm is a dead-shot with his 
pistol, aim it yourself at the enemy, and watch as each bullet pounds the enemy.
 Special Ability: That pistol can be upgraded. Using the firefly dust, Firearm can super slow down time so he can aim his gun and shoot one deadly, unstoppable bullet! 


Platforming Skill: Firearm's mechanised body parts make him a nightmare to catch. He may not be a good jumper, but he is a fantastic runner.




 


Zeal
The leader of the Guardians, the ex-leader of Victoria, Zeal was once named William. After Ripper assassinated him, with his last breath he placed his consciousness successfully into a scrappy machine. He desperately seeks revenge, participating in the Guardians missions for support.







Silhouette people populate the city. After 
an age of augmentation and industrial revolution, the one beautiful, 
vibrant city began to turn to ruin... it's people left so little human 
they became more like machines, running on the mysterious gassy liquid 
provided by the villainous Jack the Ripper and his criminal followers.

All characters are animated. Whether it is a carriage moving along the bumpy streets, or a cat licking it's back! Look in the rewards to see how YOU can become a resident of the city too!












The main enemy is Ripper, a criminal with a taste for electricity, who rose to assassinate the leader of Victoria, after making the city mentally dead and physically broken, through the spread of his drug. In levels, Ripper is typically to your left. He floats in the air, flying towards you followed by a giant cloud of thunder. In there he stores his abilities, able to shoot electricity at you, warp the screen, or summon smaller enemies to fall around you. If you run too slow, he will catch you and kill you! As the main enemy, Ripper is the main objective. After successfully completing all the levels and collecting all the machine parts, you will take him on in his lair, seeking to destroy his power, and then him, using all 3 of the characters.


Ripper isn't the only enemy in Victoria. As a magical criminal, Ripper had gained quite a following in the city from two types of people- the sprinters and the brutes. Both are criminals from the streets and sewers.


Brutes: These guys are big, tough, and can pound the life out of you. But they are slow! Vault over them however possible, and take them out from behind.

Runners: Quick, agile, and super dangerous. These women possess hand-held saws you don't want to get close to. When they see you, they will run towards you. Your best chance is to avoid them, or blast them away from afar!
There will be 2 more enemy types, with potential for more based on funding. The next 2 types are robots, hacked by Ripper.
There is however, turrets! These turrets were originally made to watch over the city as an unmanned police force, shouting instructions. The Runners hacked the turrets, adding guns to the front. Avoid them if you can!





For a Steampunk game, the music just has to be incredible. In our menus and some of the smaller levels, old silent movie and victorian music is used, provoking drama, or light-hearted fun!There is also an exclusive set of music given to the game by the incredible Off Limits, in support of the game. They are a German band with a hugely Steampunk style, performing at many events, and their music is really good.You can check them out here: http://www.offlimits.de1.cc/And you can check out their music: Music Sample

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hey, I'm Zolden. I'm an independent programmer and game designer. I'm creating games for 5 years.<br/><br/>Recently I came up with an idea to create a remake of the old dos game named Scorched Earth. But with the physics that only modern computers can run. I wanted everything in the game to be a physical and destructible, like real life objects. It didn't work at first, but then I discovered, that we can use videocard computational power to accelerate physical computations. And it worked! The prototype is playable, and feels exactly as I wanted it to feel.</p>
<p>And It seems like it will be<strong> the first game ever that is being runned completely on videocard</strong> instead of cpu. Why videocard? Because CPU's computational power is weaker than GPU's. Physical simulations are perfect for GPU computations.</p>
<p>But the finished game is more than just a working concept. Physics work, we can drive a tank and shoot rocks into pieces. But we need gameplay, interface, sounds, lots of testing and balancing - lots of things games require to be considered as a product.</p>
<p>But I'm a coder. I need artists and designers to help me turn this idea into a game. And you guys can make it happen. Together we can make this revolutionary approach real.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I simply need to support myself and 2-3 more specialists during 2-3 months, while we will be working on this game. $2000 per person per month isn't much, but I have to pay this kind of money to people to be sure they produce a high quality product. So, I need about $20000</p>
<p>What will you get? Free copy of the game mostly. It's price on steam will be about $10. You will get it for $5 if you bake the project. This simple.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>I'm a big ""physics in games"" enthusiast, and I want more of it in games. GPU computations are not widely used in modern games. Everybody is trying to make their graphics realistic. I wanted to go different way. I want the game itself to be realistic.</p>
<p>So, this game will be revolutionary by two reasons:</p>
<p>1. It is a complete physical simulation. There's nothing but physic laws affecting the behavior of every pixel in the game.</p>
<p>2. The game runs completely on GPU. CPU only handles interface and input.</p>
<p>Game's style will be retro, but you will need a modern videocard to make this game work with good fps.</p>
<p>Currently all technical problems have been solved. The prototype you see on the video is a result of three months of almost every day coding. Now everything works, and I simply need to build a game out of the robust prototype. Let's make it real, guys. It should be a great game.</p>

The prototype is playable, and feels exactly as I wanted it to feel.
And It seems like it will be the first game ever that is being runned completely on videocard instead of cpu. Why videocard? Because CPU's computational power is weaker than GPU's. Physical simulations are perfect for GPU computations.
But the finished game is more than just a working concept. Physics work, we can drive a tank and shoot rocks into pieces. But we need gameplay, interface, sounds, lots of testing and balancing - lots of things games require to be considered as a product.
But I'm a coder. I need artists and designers to help me turn this idea into a game. And you guys can make it happen. Together we can make this revolutionary approach real.
 

What I Need & What You Get
I simply need to support myself and 2-3 more specialists during 2-3 months, while we will be working on this game. $2000 per person per month isn't much, but I have to pay this kind of money to people to be sure they produce a high quality product. So, I need about $20000
What will you get? Free copy of the game mostly. It's price on steam will be about $10. You will get it for $5 if you bake the project. This simple.
 

The Impact
I'm a big ""physics in games"" enthusiast, and I want more of it in games. GPU computations are not widely used in modern games. Everybody is trying to make their graphics realistic. I wanted to go different way. I want the game itself to be realistic.
So, this game will be revolutionary by two reasons:
1. It is a complete physical simulation. There's nothing but physic laws affecting the behavior of every pixel in the game.
2. The game runs completely on GPU. CPU only handles interface and input.
Game's style will be retro, but you will need a modern videocard to make this game work with good fps.
Currently all technical problems have been solved. The prototype you see on the video is a result of three months of almost every day coding. Now everything works, and I simply need to build a game out of the robust prototype. Let's make it real, guys. It should be a great game.",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<p>World of Steam is an open world rpg that allows you to play how you want. It drops you into this massive world full of people who all have stories of their own, and lets you live your own story as you play. There's the standard style of rpg play, where you go around fighting the bad guys, leveling up, delving deep into forgotten dungeons and exploring ancient forgotten ruins. Then there's everything else... Want to settle down, live the quiet life? In World of Steam we have a property</p>
<span class=""western""> management system that allows you to buy plots of land, or buildings all <br/>over the world. You an buy a farm and spend your time growing vegetables <br/>and tending to your animals. Make your farm a success and build it up by <br/>adding new structures and purchasing new tools. When it gets too big for <br/>you to run by yourself, or you just want a break from the grind, you can hire<br/>npc's to help you run things.

Maybe you've always dreamed of becoming a merchant? You can purchase <br/>a building in one of the cities and open the shop of your dreams. You can <br/>buy/sell/trade all kinds of stock, and must manage and order what you<br/> want to keep on hand. Npc's who find your shop useful and the customer <br/>service satisfactory will be sure to become regular customers. Those are just a couple of the many progressions slated to be added in<br/> game. <br/><br/>Now, let's get to the steam part. Suppose you've always wanted to<br/>become an airship captain. Well in world of steam you can! You can<br/>purchase or build several different styles of airships in-game. Then you<br/>can use those airships to set up trade routes between cities, join in the <br/>royal fleet, become a smuggler, or just cause havoc, lie, cheat, and<br/>steal your way to the top as an airship pirate.

The Future Online RHETTS Word Game

These cards are part of the current home game delivered to $100+ contributors.

These are the card boxes, 54 cards each. 

This unique scoring system which makes Rhetts so exciting and enjoyable to play.




Long words are harder to form then short words. Rhetts well rewards this highest achievement in the game. The future computer software calculates all of these points.Score sheet for home playing card game only. This is not used for future internet game, which will perform all of these calculations automatically.

My Indiegogo project is about transforming the original 1989 Rhetts playing card game into the planned computerized software version belowThis is a fictitious game between Jane and John. This is the 2nd round of play. The blue color ""calculate"" button is to be pressed after all words are formed, ready for match-up.John's word making area before he submits his words. He only has the agreed 1.5 total minutes to form his words. He formed the word ""Taken"", placed it in one of the above word boxes, and then he placed his 6 discards in the big red discard box on the lower right.This is after John already pressed the red discard button on the right. The computer already dealt him 6 replacement cards which have been sorted by color and placed on his left. The red discard button and discard box is gone since there is only one chance for discarding.John used his updated set of cards to form 3 words. The word ""Handsaw"" receives 15 bonus points for length. Since all 14 cards have been used, John receives an additional bonus of 10 points for a ""Stack"". He is now ready to submit his final words by pressing the green ""Submit"" button on the right.This is after John submitted his words and Jane submitted her words. Jane scored even higher by forming the very long word ""Lightest"". The blue ""Challenge"" buttons provide both players up to 10 seconds to challenge the correctness of any one word of their opponents.

This gives an idea of the future online lobby of available tables to play the Rhetts game. ""Public"" means anyone can ask to join the table, ""Private"" is reserved for a known friend or family member of the table host. ""Rating"" gives an idea of the playing skill of the host. ""Rounds"" tells you the number of rounds of play already set by the table host. ""Time Limit"" represents the preset maximum number of minutes the host has determined for total word making for each round of play. Of course, any player can create and host their own table, set their own number of rounds, set a time limit per round, and determine public or private by pressing the ""Host New Table"" button at the bottom right.The projected 2015 estimated game play date is based on the sole software programmer taking about 1 whole year to develop the game. If funding is over $70K paying for a 2-person team and/or if the sole programmer can make the game even faster then projected, then game play could possibly take place in 2014.

Just place the cursor on the weblink below and then press the CTRL key and the left mouse button.

Hallo, ich bin Daniel Eder, komme aus Miesbach (ein kleiner Ort zwischen Rosenheim und Bad Tölz) und bin 15 Jahre alt. 
Vor 2 Jahren habe ich mit der Entwicklung meines ersten PC Spieles
begonnen. Mein erstes Projekt „House of Mystery"" steht nun kurz vor der
Fertigstellung. Ich habe viel Arbeit in das
Spiel rein gesteckt und möchte es gerne Verkaufen.
Damit ich mein ""House of Mystery"" verkaufen kann, brauche ich ein
wenig finanzielle Unterstützung. Die Verkaufs-Lizenz der Unreal Engine 3 (Tool mit dem ich das Spiel entwickle) kostet rund 80,00 € (99,00 $). Das Spiel möchte ich gerne über Steam Greenlight vertreiben. Hier wird eine Gebühr in Höhe von 90,00 € fällig, wären also
insgesamt 170,00 €.

Das Spiel selbst
House of Mystery ist ein 3D-Jump ’n’ Run-Spiel mit Rätsel-Elementen. Ziel des Spiels ist, HOM komplett zu durchqueren und am Ende das Geheimnis des Hauses zu lüften.
Die Räume des Hauses sind in einer vorgegebenen Reihenfolge mit steigendem Schwierigkeitsgrad zu durchlaufen. Jeder Raum hat eine Aufgabe. Dabei liegt der Schwerpunkt mal auf dem Lösen eines Rätsels (z.B. Schalter Kombination), mal ist Geschicklichkeit in Jump 'n' Run Parcours gefragt.
Grafik und Sound sollten dabei für eine geheimnisvolle und mysteriöse
Atmosphäre sorgen. Hier habe ich viel Arbeit reingesteckt. Auch das Level
Design hat viel Zeit in Anspruch genommen.

From Wildfire Games, the studio that brought you the highly acclaimed Age of Empires II: Age of Kings full-conversion mod Rome At War...Comes a highly anticipated open-source real-time strategy game, inspired by the classic games of the genre, such as Age of Empires, Rise of Nations, Starcraft, Command & Conquer, and Battle for Middle Earth:It's a real-time strategy game based on the years 500 B.C. through 1 B.C., when the Roman Republic saw its meteoric rise, Alexander the Great's epic empire was built and crumbled into competing kingdoms, the Celts menaced Italy and Greece from the North, and Hannibal crossed the Alps with his corps of elephants.""0 A.D."" is a time that never was: A time when the civilizations of antiquity were all at the peak of their development.We take the classic elements of real-time strategy gaming, where you build a civilization from scratch, recruit an army, then go massacre your enemies, and update them for the 21st century with exciting new features, a dozen fully-realized civilizations, and modern graphics powered by our custom-built open-source engine Pyrogenesis.And those are already completed! We have two more on the way: The Ptolemaic Egyptians and the Seleucid Empire. Each of our 12 factions has unique art, unique unit rosters, historical heroes, and technology trees customized for historical authenticity and cool factor.This is what we've always wanted in a real-time strategy game.We're building 0 A.D. – Empires Ascendant because we love strategy gaming and we think the current state of the strategy genre is abysmal. While there have been some great strategy games released recently, we feel like the essence of old-school Real-Time Strategy has been lost. We'd like to recapture that.We're taking the old-school conventions of the genre and updating them. 0 A.D. – Empires Ascendant is inspired by Age of Empires, but also takes cues from games like Battle for Middle Earth II, Rome: Total War, Starcraft, Age of Kings and others. We've honed the game's design into a coherent, unique whole, that delivers an authentic experience.Over the years (development went open-source in 2009), the game's design has evolved considerably, but our hearts have always been set on recreating that feeling we had when we played our first real-time strategy game all those years ago.

Classic base building mechanics.
Up to 20 different buildings for each and every faction: Forts, Blacksmiths, Houses, Barracks, City Walls, you name it.
Each building has a very specific purpose and function, with a whole tree of common and unique technologies.
Grab exclusive territory on the map with our dynamic territory system, so you can expand your empire and deprive your enemies of land and resources.



Up to a dozen different unique soldiers for each faction! Spartan Hoplites, Persian Immortals, Iberian Devotio, Macedonian Companions, Roman Hastati.
A multi-layered counter system that adds more depth than the old rock-paper-scissors mechanic.
Formations, like the classic Greek Phalanx, the Roman Testudo, and Cavalry Wedge.



Each faction comes with a unique navy - Triremes, Quinqueremes, Pentakonters, fire ships, and more!
Garrison units aboard your warships to add to their firepower and abilities.
Transport your troops across the sea in warships for amphibious assaults and invasions.
Ramming will be a feature so that you can reenact or rewrite classic naval battles, like the Battle of Actium or Battle of Salamis.

All of that, and not only is 0 A.D. - Empires Ascendant open-source, but...

Our code is GPL 2.

Our art and sound are CC-BY-SA 3.0.

Our game is cross-platform: Windows, Linux, OSX.
Our game is single player - slaughter the AI.

Our game is multiplayer - slaughter your friends.

Our game is educational - learn from it.

Our game has a 100% all-original soundtrack. Yes, really.

Our game is awesome.
Our game is FREE. No cost. No pay-to-play. No pay-to-win. No DRM junk. Share it. Mod it. Live it. Love it.

You can even demo the game right now! Warning: Alpha release, may contain bugs, lag, and general warfare.

You care about good strategy gaming. You're a fan of history (and you like to trample Romans with war elephants).You care about software freedom. You care about modding.You care about the future of Linux gaming. You care about cross-platform games.People are spending more money, time and attention on playing computer games than ever before, and games are constantly evolving into a more nuanced medium of expression and a greater part of our culture. But so much of it is dominated by large, for-profit corporations. The options to mod the games are so limited. And so few high-quality games are developed for free platforms such as GNU/Linux.0 A.D. is different. It is free (as in ""freedom""), open-source software.We think gamers should be allowed to learn how their games work, change them, share them and redistribute their works. This freedom to tinker is what free, open-source software is all about and so we hope a lot of people tinker with 0 A.D. Just imagine what wonderful things might come out of it.We've seen triumphs of similarly free, open-source software from Mozilla Firefox to the 3d graphics program Blender. Now it's high time for a free, open-source game to shine. Moreover, 0 A.D. runs on Windows, GNU/Linux and the Mac. So it spreads freedom everywhere.0 A.D. is an associated project of Software in the Public Interest, Inc. (SPI). SPI is a non-profit organization based in the USA, that acts as a fiscal sponsor to many open source projects, including Debian, Drupal and LibreOffice, and since December 2012, also 0 A.D. This means SPI can accept donations and hold funds for the development of 0 A.D., and we are using it for the purposes of this fundraiser.Importantly, SPI is a tax-exempt public charity described under section 501©(3) of the US Internal Revenue Code. This means that for many US taxpayers, some or all of your donation towards this fundraiser may be tax deductible. For details, please consult your tax advisor. (For tax purposes, you will get full acknowledgments of the values of the perks you received.)

“The landscape of PC gaming is littered with bright ideas and good intentions: both of those things seem true of 0 A.D.” – Jim Rossignol, Rock, Paper, Shotgun
“With a codebase of over 150k lines of C++ code plus 25k lines in development tools, this is looking like a fairly promising entrant into the open source RTS field. The screenshots are definitely pretty, to say the least.” – Slashdot
“Gorgeous graphics, with beautiful 3D rendering [... T]his is the first RTS I’m actually enthused about” – John Knight, Linux Journal
“One of the most fantastic games that is being developed right now in the open source community. [...] It’s really showing that if you spend enough time, and if you spend enough energy and resources, you can really pull off a game that is 100% worth playing.” – InfinitelyGalactic Reviews
“[T]he most exciting game available for Linux. It still has a long way to go before being completed but I am confident that the game will, like some of ancient civilisations within it, grow into something special; A milestone sure to be noted in the history of Linux gaming.” – Georgi Karavasilev, OMG!Ubuntu!
“With its incredible art and intelligent gameplay, however, 0 A.D. stands poised to [demonstrate] that an open-source project powered by volunteers can produce a modern, cross-platform game on par with the expensive Windows-only packages developed by commercial houses.” – Christopher Tozzi, The VAR Guy

PerformanceRight now, performance is not where it needs to be. Bottlenecks include pathfinding, the range manager, AI scripting, garbage collection, and memory allocation. A focused programming effort can help improve on all of these areas.GameplayWhile the 0 A.D. - Empires Ascendant is already playable, there are many features still missing from the game that will be essential in defining what ""0 A.D."" gameplay is all about. They include formations, unique technology implementations, hero auras, building capturing, and intense naval combat. We also plan on including what we call ""Skirmish Maps"" to augment scenarios and random map scripts. Skirmish maps are essentially hand-crafted scenarios with the functionality of random maps.ContentThe art department is still working on adding to the rich cache of content players expect in a AAA RTS game. The Egyptians (of the Ptolemaic dynasty) are being worked on as you read this. We also need dozens of new animations. We've started remodeling and replacing our old unit meshes to remain Blender-compatible and facilitate new animations.Stable, Feature-Rich MultiplayerThere is a multiplayer lobby patch already submitted, but will require testing and changes in order to make it ready for our fans. Functionality we want includes NAT migration (so the game doesn't crash when the host quits), user lobby creation, and transferring user-created content between players (scenarios, skirmish maps, random maps, mods).Single-Player Campaign(s)We would like to include a single-player campaign for 0 A.D. - Empires Ascendant if we reach our stretch goals. Either a narrative campaign with a storyline written by Michael [Mythos_Ruler] or a real-time strategic campaign, akin to something you would see from Total War or Rise of Nations.With your help, we can successfully meet these challenges and give you a game worth obsessing over.Read on to find out about who we'd like to hire to help us finish this beast.My name is Jorma Rebane [aka RedFox], and I'm a college student at the University of Tartu, Estonia, majoring in Computer Engineering and Robotics. I'm already working full-time on the game with the funds raised from previous, smaller fundraisers.With your help, I hope to continue programming 0 A.D. full-time as a contractor for at least a year.I have around 7 years of experience in a variety of programming languages and projects. Starting with mods like 'Diadochi - Total War' and ending with commercial Robotics R&D projects at University of Tartu, Institute of Technology. As a hobby, I also give short courses in x86 Assembly programming every year for second year graduates.Strategy games have been my small passion ever since the first Age of Empires; and has grown stronger yet after gems like StarCraft - Brood War and Rome - Total War.In 2007, I released a total-conversion mod for Rome:TW, called Diadochi - Total War and soon after I reached the limitations of the Rome engine. At that point I started working on my own game engine called 'Legacy' with little to no prior knowledge of C++, which proved to be a huge learning curve to me. Even though the game project didn't succeed, I used my gained knowledge and experience to land a job in robotics R&D.Now after a long break from game development, I'm back on track and burning with passion to help finish 0 A.D.There are few main areas that I will focus on:

Overall Code Quality
Good Game Performance so the game won't lag
Fun Game Features
Open-source Patch Review (add new things to the game faster)
Development Blog to let our fans in on my progress

I'm Michael Hafer [aka Mythos_Ruler], from Indiana, USA, and I'm the project leader for 0 A.D.I joined the Wildfire Games team in October 2003 as a concept artist, sketching buildings in my sketchbook and scanning them with my old Memorex scanner. Later, I learned Photoshop and how to create textures. Then I learned how to edit models. Soon, I was creating all new content for the game and helping to manage the art department, creating public relations graphics, helping recruit new team members, and moderating the forums. I was doing all of this in a hobbyist capacity, as were the rest of my teammates.Eventually, I became the art department leader and I helped guide the release of 0 A.D.'s many Alpha releases. In early 2013, 0 A.D.'s project leader Erik Johansson (erik_feneur) stepped down from his post after shepherding the project for many years, and I assumed his role.I believed that we needed a new plan for developing 0 A.D. I worked out some general plans looking forward to the next few years and after much internal discussion with the entire Wildfire Games team, we decided the project has grown so large, it needs a couple of full-time developers to work on it.There are four main areas that I will focus on:

Project Management to keep development moving at a good pace
Outreach and Recruitment to get the word out about 0 A.D. and recruit new team members
Fun Game Design, Good Balance, and Documentation
Art Design and Cool Game Assets

The above is only a small part of what I'll do. I can't wait to get started and I can't wait to work with Jorma and the rest of the development community on making 0 A.D. – Empires Ascendant into the game we've always wanted to play.Any amount you donate helps the cause!

Read more about 0 A.D.'s development on our Wikipedia page or on the official 0 A.D. website!In short order, Wildfire Studios developed and released a widely acclaimed mod for Age of Kings, titled Rome At War, and began planning a full-conversion of the Age of Kings engine to create a whole new strategy game based on antiquity.When the team reached the limits of modding, we decided to create a brand new engine, Pyrogenesis, powerful enough and flexible enough to fulfill Wildfire’s ambitious goal. “Wildfire Studios” was no longer a modding team, but an independent game developer, made up of a community of volunteers from all over the world. Wildfire Games was born, and we've been at this ever since.We've had nearly 100 contributors over the years, in art, programming, website development, sound, music, and many other areas, but the core conviction remains the same. The development of 0 A.D. is truly a global effort of folks who are fanatical about ancient history and strategy gaming, and who are dedicated to seeing development through to the end.",48.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>In Sleepless Knight you play as Vhulrik, a once great Knight
who fought for the kingdom in a time long ago. But due to the rituals from the
Cult of Chaos, Vhulrik finds himself among the living once again and under
attack from the Eight Lords of Chaos. Now Vhulrik must defeat the Eight Lords
and save the kingdom from certain destruction.</p>
<p><b>The Game</b></p>
<p><b>Weapons</b></p><p><b></b></p><p><b><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/465113/files/20140327135233-weapons.jpg?1395953553"" src="""" style=""""/></b></p><p></p>
<p>Upon leaving the tutorial
zone, the player will have the choice of
several different weapon types to use. One Handed and Shield, Great Weapon, and
Duel Wield, as well as a ranged weapon (hand crossbow). At any time, except in
boss chambers, the player can access and change these weapons through and
equpment menue. Each weapon type have<span>  different
attack speed, power, and unique ability. Each weapon type will have Ten
different weapons, each with a property such as fire damage, bleed, poison,
etc. The meaning behinds this is to make it so no one weapon is truly better
then another, regardless of when the weapon was found, but my be better for a
situation. For a example, using a flame weapon on ice creatures.</span></p>
<p>This is the Status Bar. It
shows the Player’s Health (Red), Stamina (Green), and Mana (Blue). It also
shows the number of Health and Mana potions, which weapon is being used, and
which spell is equiped.</p>
<p><span>  
 
</span></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/465117/files/20140327135441-Status_Bar.jpg?1395953681"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p>
<p><b>Stamina Bar</b></p>
<p>The Stamina bar is a little unique in Sleepless Knight. It
is the resource in which the player uses the abilities of the weapon types with
a catch. When the stamina bar is completely depleted, Vhulrik’s arms can no
longer take the strain and break. His arms will fly off and land somewhere on
screen where then the player must run to the detached limbs and reattach them
to continue fighting. If the player is unable to reach the limbs for any
reason, within 30 seconds (time will be adjusted during testing), his arms will
magically reattach themselves.</p>
<p>Using the One Hand/Shield grants the ability to block any
attack (taken that the player is facing the correct way) but successfully
blocking an attack takes stamina proportionate to the damage the attack would
do.</p>
<p>The Great Weapon’s ability is a heavy attack that stuns most
enemies if they are not killed outright. Though very powerful, the attack is
slow, leaving the player open to being struck by the enemy.</p>
<p>The Duel Wielding weapons ability is a fast dash strike that
moves through enemies dealing damage. A skill that is fast and easily
spammable, until your arms fall off.</p>
<p>The stamina bar refills over time and from pickups from
defeated enemies.</p>
<p><b>Spells</b></p>
<p>There will be a total of eight spells in the game. The
player will start with one and obtain the others through defeating seven of the
eight Lords of Chaos. The last boss does not give a spell because after
defeating them, the game is over.</p>
<p>The Spells differ from one another on type, damage, and how
many uses. Some are large AOE attacks that cost a significant amount of mana,
while others are fast rapid fire type spells that cost little.</p>

In Sleepless Knight you play as Vhulrik, a once great Knight
who fought for the kingdom in a time long ago. But due to the rituals from the
Cult of Chaos, Vhulrik finds himself among the living once again and under
attack from the Eight Lords of Chaos. Now Vhulrik must defeat the Eight Lords
and save the kingdom from certain destruction.
The Game
Weapons
Upon leaving the tutorial
zone, the player will have the choice of
several different weapon types to use. One Handed and Shield, Great Weapon, and
Duel Wield, as well as a ranged weapon (hand crossbow). At any time, except in
boss chambers, the player can access and change these weapons through and
equpment menue. Each weapon type have  different
attack speed, power, and unique ability. Each weapon type will have Ten
different weapons, each with a property such as fire damage, bleed, poison,
etc. The meaning behinds this is to make it so no one weapon is truly better
then another, regardless of when the weapon was found, but my be better for a
situation. For a example, using a flame weapon on ice creatures.
This is the Status Bar. It
shows the Player’s Health (Red), Stamina (Green), and Mana (Blue). It also
shows the number of Health and Mana potions, which weapon is being used, and
which spell is equiped.
  
 

Stamina Bar
The Stamina bar is a little unique in Sleepless Knight. It
is the resource in which the player uses the abilities of the weapon types with
a catch. When the stamina bar is completely depleted, Vhulrik’s arms can no
longer take the strain and break. His arms will fly off and land somewhere on
screen where then the player must run to the detached limbs and reattach them
to continue fighting. If the player is unable to reach the limbs for any
reason, within 30 seconds (time will be adjusted during testing), his arms will
magically reattach themselves.
Using the One Hand/Shield grants the ability to block any
attack (taken that the player is facing the correct way) but successfully
blocking an attack takes stamina proportionate to the damage the attack would
do.
The Great Weapon’s ability is a heavy attack that stuns most
enemies if they are not killed outright. Though very powerful, the attack is
slow, leaving the player open to being struck by the enemy.
The Duel Wielding weapons ability is a fast dash strike that
moves through enemies dealing damage. A skill that is fast and easily
spammable, until your arms fall off.
The stamina bar refills over time and from pickups from
defeated enemies.
Spells
There will be a total of eight spells in the game. The
player will start with one and obtain the others through defeating seven of the
eight Lords of Chaos. The last boss does not give a spell because after
defeating them, the game is over.
The Spells differ from one another on type, damage, and how
many uses. Some are large AOE attacks that cost a significant amount of mana,
while others are fast rapid fire type spells that cost little.
Mana recovers through mana potions and pickups from defeated
enemies.
Creatures and Levels
Each of the levels and creatures that are contained within
are designed for each of the eight Lords of Chaos. They are as followed.
War, Bone, Filth, Shadow, Iron,
Embers, Flesh, and Chaos.
Each level will consist of three stages. The first stage
will be a basic level with little platforming to show the player the new
enemies and mechanics of the level. The second stage differs from level to
level depending on which Lord you are attacking, though the common factor that
all the second stages have is adding more creatures, traps, and a miniboss. The
final stage will be very drastic from any other level. For example, War’s stage
is a converted castle that the player must navigate in a metroidvania style.

This seemingly amazing idea soon evolved into a huge unplayable mess. Imagine thousands of players trying to control one character. The game ""Choice Chamber"" brought a refreshing level of organization to this audience controlled aspect of gameplay. We are now taking this organized methodology and applying it to our own genre of retro arcade shooters.</p>

I have been interested in video games since I was young, and while it was something I wanted to do, I chose to pick more achievable goals. However, with the recent boom of the indie game industry, as well as the advent of crowdfunding sites like these, I have decided to pursue this goal once more. This is very important to me, so now I turn to you to help me with this endeavor.</p>
<p>     The reason I’m asking for this much money is pretty simple. Some of it will go towards purchasing software (I’m currently looking into music software), and a good portion will be going toward personal costs for the next several months. I live pretty cheaply, and felt this amount was a good estimate. If I don’t manage to make it to my goal, I’m still going to get this game made somehow, it’s just going to be delayed a great deal.</p>
<p align=""center"">The World of Moros</p>
<p>Since time immemorial, there have been 6 nations. Xanorcis and Antekta to the west, Mirilon to the north, Ebysius and Estorova to the east, and Juditis to the south. The nations were constantly at war with another and bickering over territory as far back as history was recorded. However, nearly 20 years ago, there was a massive explosion. A sizable mountain range, along with much of the surrounding countryside, was leveled almost instantly. Some considered it an act of a divine being. Others wondered if it was the world itself, showing rebellion to what was happening. Most, however, considered it to be a test of a powerful weapon from another nation.</p>
<p>The most curious part was the fact that no one took credit for what happened. Under such circumstance, the nation’s created a ceasefire between all of them. Although everyone signed and agreed, it was clear that research and preparations for further combat was the true purpose.</p>
<p>This brings us to today. Although there has technically been a strained peace for nearly 20 years, there seems to be a shift in recent diplomacy. As the world prepares for war once more, one with a hidden agenda emerges…</p>
<p> </p>
<p align=""center"">Characters</p>
<p>Roland: The main character. A young man who hails from Mirilon, and has recently become a castle guard. Skills focus on physical damage and self-buffs.</p>
<p>Zelbess: An old friend of Roland’s, and a fellow guard. Able to damage opponents while reducing their abilities.</p>
<p>Karen: A hotheaded person; is in the same unit as Roland. Is able to cast a variety of fire spells.</p>
<p>Elena: The unit’s medic. Normally soft-spoken, but is simply used to being told what to do. Her abilities revolve around healing.</p>
<p align=""center"">Other important characters</p>
<p>Roderick the Third: The captain of the guard, and Zelbess’ adopted father. A man of peerless loyalty, he turned down becoming a general in order to remain protecting the royal family.</p>
<p>Celia: A librarian who finds life rather boring. She may be willing to help the party, but for an unusual price…</p>
<p>Davis: What Roderick is to Mirilon, Davis is to Ebysius. A competent fighter, and one for actions, not words.</p>
<p align=""center"">Statistics</p>
<p>HP (Hit Points): How much damage a character can sustain before falling unconscious.</p>
<p>STM (Stamina): A regenerating resource for using attacks and abilities.</p>

<p>ELE.% (Elemental Rate): Alters how much damage a specific element will deal to you by the listed percentage. There are 6 different elemental types: Fire, Water, Earth, Wind, Holy, and Dark.</p>
<p align=""center"">Menu</p>
<p align=""center"">I’m still doing a bit of work on this front, so here’s a list of what I intend to implement.</p>
<p>Equip: Displays the character’s statistics, as well as letting you change out their equipment.</p>
<p>Equipment Slots: Left Hand, Right Hand, Arms, Torso, Feet, and 2 Accessory slots.</p>
<p>Party: Allows you to switch active and reserve party members.</p>
<p>Save: Lets you save the game (no inconvenience of having to find a save point).</p>
<p>Skills: Lets you look over the abilities the character has learned.</p>
<p>Method: Changes the character’s combat method; how the character gains Stamina in battle.</p>
<p>Items: Lets you look at the party’s inventory, as well as use recovery items.</p>
<p> </p>
<p align=""center"">Combat</p>
<p>Legend of Moros uses a turn-based combat system. After inputting your party’s commands, they and the enemies will take their actions. The order in which actions take place is determined by the SPD stat. The higher their SPD, the sooner they will act. Certain actions (like the Guard command) will take place first, regardless of the user’s SPD.</p>
<p>Using most actions requires some STM. Some actions cost none, and certain characters will gain skills that generate it. Each character also has a ‘Method’ set. This determines the way the character generates STM. All Methods generate some passively every turn, not at the same rate, and may have other ways of generating it. Some examples are as follows:</p>
<p>Berserker: Regain some STM when you deal or take damage.</p>
<p>Doctor: Regain some STM from recovering someone’s HP.</p>
<p>Arrogance: Gain extra STM per turn, but lose some whenever you take damage.</p>
<p>Masochist: Gain STM whenever you take damage or are hit with a status effect.</p>
<p align=""center""> </p>
<p align=""center"">Status Effects</p>
<p>Status effects are temporary alterations to a character. There are two types: Positive Statuses and Negative Statuses.</p>
<p>Examples of Negative Statuses include:</p>
<p>Berserk: Character can’t be controlled; will randomly attack an ally or opponent.</p>
<p>Degen: Character loses 10% of their HP every turn.</p>
<p>Cursed: Character takes 10% of all damage they deal.</p>
<p>Stunned: Character is unable to act; EVA% becomes 0.</p>
<p>Weary: Reduces STM generation by 20%.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Examples of Positive Statuses include:</p>
<p>Reflect: Spells cast on the character will instead be returned to the caster.</p>
<p>Recovery: Character regains 10% of their HP every turn.</p>
<p>Resist: Character is immune to Negative Statuses.</p>
<p>Absorption: Character recovers 10% of all damage they deal.</p>
<p>Vigor: Increases STM generation by 20%.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>                                           Character Skills</p>
<p>Characters don't actually gain new skills by leveling. Skills are gained either through story progression, or through sidequests. Leveling simply serves to increase a character's statistics.</p>
<p>It is worth mentioning that, while each character has a certain archetype in mind, nearly every character has multiple ways of affecting combat.</p>
<p>Examples of skills the main character learns include:</p>
<p>Power Swing: Has a reduced chance to hit, but deals increased damage, as well as having a higher critical hit chance.</p>
<p>Cleave: Hits all enemies, for approx. 75% of your normal attack damage.</p>
<p>Refocus: Grants yourself Regen, as well as increasing your accuracy.</p>
<p>Call to Arms: Grants all allies Vigor.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>That concludes this basic explanation of how the game works. Please contact me if you have any questions, or have an idea for something I should add. Thank you!</p></div>","Hello!

Berserker: Regain some STM when you deal or take damage.
Doctor: Regain some STM from recovering someone’s HP.
Arrogance: Gain extra STM per turn, but lose some whenever you take damage.
Masochist: Gain STM whenever you take damage or are hit with a status effect.
 
Status Effects
Status effects are temporary alterations to a character. There are two types: Positive Statuses and Negative Statuses.
Examples of Negative Statuses include:
Berserk: Character can’t be controlled; will randomly attack an ally or opponent.
Degen: Character loses 10% of their HP every turn.
Cursed: Character takes 10% of all damage they deal.
Stunned: Character is unable to act; EVA% becomes 0.
Weary: Reduces STM generation by 20%.
 
Examples of Positive Statuses include:
Reflect: Spells cast on the character will instead be returned to the caster.
Recovery: Character regains 10% of their HP every turn.
Resist: Character is immune to Negative Statuses.
Absorption: Character recovers 10% of all damage they deal.
Vigor: Increases STM generation by 20%.
 
                                           Character Skills
Characters don't actually gain new skills by leveling. Skills are gained either through story progression, or through sidequests. Leveling simply serves to increase a character's statistics.
It is worth mentioning that, while each character has a certain archetype in mind, nearly every character has multiple ways of affecting combat.
Examples of skills the main character learns include:
Power Swing: Has a reduced chance to hit, but deals increased damage, as well as having a higher critical hit chance.
Cleave: Hits all enemies, for approx. 75% of your normal attack damage.
Refocus: Grants yourself Regen, as well as increasing your accuracy.
Call to Arms: Grants all allies Vigor.
 
That concludes this basic explanation of how the game works. Please contact me if you have any questions, or have an idea for something I should add. Thank you!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>We are Japanime Games. We've brought you the Tanto Cuore series and the Lupin the Third board game, we also have a new deck building game arriving soon called Kanzume Goddess. Now we would like to revisit one of our favorite titles. We want to translate the third game in the Tanto Cuore series,<em>Tanto Cuore: Romantic Vacation</em>, into English as we have done for the previous two games in the series: <em>Tanto Cuore </em>and <em>Expanding the House</em>. This game is a stand-alone game like the last two, but can also be combined with the previous games to have a wide variety of card choices. We need your help to make that happen! We'd like to start translation of the game soon so that we can get the game into your hands as quickly as possible. It's our goal to have the game ready to ship to you in January of 2013. With your help, we can bring the maids to a wider audience!</p>
<h3><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i.imgur.com/S4JnP.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></h3>
<p>Tanto Cuore is a deck building card game for 2–4 players. It can be played separately or used together with the Tanto Cuore, Tanto Cuore Expansion or both. </p>
<p>The players take the roles of ”masters of house”, who have moved out from their mansions to a summer vacation on a southern island. Even here, they employ a lot of cute maids, are served by them while slowly ﬁlling out their house (card deck). </p>
<p>When the game ends, the player who has most victory point (VP) gaining maids and (introduced in this set) recollection cards is the ”perfect master” and the winner of the game.</p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i.imgur.com/3rikz.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>- 206 Maid Cards (32 Chambermaids, 174 General Maids)</p>
<p>- 16 Recollection Cards</p>
<p>- 56 Love Cards</p>
<p>- 1 Rulebook</p>

<p>A Deck Building Card Game is a game in which players build their own deck during the game. All players start with same small deck, then they will add new cards to their deck using their own strategy. </p>
<p>It uses a scheme similar to a TCG(Trading card game) in that players will use their own deck. However, the Deck Building Card Game has many additional features; for instance, you can play with multiple players, and many different decks without paying extra money or collecting rare chase cards. This box contains everything you need to play!</p>

We've brought you the Tanto Cuore series and the Lupin the Third board game, we also have a new deck building game arriving soon called Kanzume Goddess. Now we would like to revisit one of our favorite titles. We want to translate the third game in the Tanto Cuore series,Tanto Cuore: Romantic Vacation, into English as we have done for the previous two games in the series: Tanto Cuore and Expanding the House. This game is a stand-alone game like the last two, but can also be combined with the previous games to have a wide variety of card choices. We need your help to make that happen! We'd like to start translation of the game soon so that we can get the game into your hands as quickly as possible. It's our goal to have the game ready to ship to you in January of 2013. With your help, we can bring the maids to a wider audience!

Tanto Cuore is a deck building card game for 2–4 players. It can be played separately or used together with the Tanto Cuore, Tanto Cuore Expansion or both. 
The players take the roles of ”masters of house”, who have moved out from their mansions to a summer vacation on a southern island. Even here, they employ a lot of cute maids, are served by them while slowly ﬁlling out their house (card deck). 
When the game ends, the player who has most victory point (VP) gaining maids and (introduced in this set) recollection cards is the ”perfect master” and the winner of the game.

- 206 Maid Cards (32 Chambermaids, 174 General Maids)
- 16 Recollection Cards
- 56 Love Cards
- 1 Rulebook


A Deck Building Card Game is a game in which players build their own deck during the game. All players start with same small deck, then they will add new cards to their deck using their own strategy. 
It uses a scheme similar to a TCG(Trading card game) in that players will use their own deck. However, the Deck Building Card Game has many additional features; for instance, you can play with multiple players, and many different decks without paying extra money or collecting rare chase cards. This box contains everything you need to play!

<h3>BSA Florida Seabase Coral Reef Sailing Adventure Summer 2013!</h3>
<p>               Hi, I'm Kyle Flett a Boy Scout with Troop 211 in Maple Grove Minnesota. I'm a high school Junior and working on my last 2 badges for Eagle Scout. My Dad, Ron is an Assistant Scout Leader and High Adventure Coordinator for the Troop. Our Troop  has reservations at BSA Florida Seabase in the Florida Keys for a weeklong sailing adventure next summer. Seabase is considered to be the pinnacle of a scout's career and offers opportunities to sail, snorkel and fish the keys while learning about the reef ecosystem.</p>
<p>               My Dad will lead the trip and for the two of us the total cost  will be about $3000. The Troop does many fundraisers throughout the year but bagging groceries and selling wreaths is hardly putting a dent in the cost. Through this campaign I'm seeking to raise approximately one third of the cost of our trips. It breaks down like this: $1743 for Seabase fees, $900 for airfare, $400 for ground transportation, hotel and food etc. All funds raised will be channeled through our Boy Scout accounts and applied to Seabase related fees by the Troop treasurer. Any donation would help, No amount is too small.              </p>
<p>The return on your donation is the satisfaction in knowing that you have helped a Boy Scout and his Dad attend Florida Seabase together.</p>
<p>Thanks!! Kyle</p>

<b>About
Furie and Whispe Editions 

</b><p>
</p>
<p><b>
Furie</b><span style=""font-weight: normal;""> : A powerful, fast and lethal
skirmish game, in an ancient arcanepunk universe...  where each
faction is defined by its psychology as well as by its powers, giving
a unique « touch » to the different populations on the battlefield.

</span></p>
<p>
</p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">At
the heart of a continent dominated by an orcish Empire on the
decline, endless Dwarf caravans flee the return of powerful Yetis,
servants of the god of winter, Ygmir, battles rages !!!</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Will
you decide to join the expansionary Goblin Soviet Republic, who
according to the wisest men could soon become the greatest power of
the continent ? Will you be a preacher of the usurpers Gods from the
stars in the heart of the Kingdom of Esialdes ? Will you contribute
to spread the madness of the elfic hordes on the continent ? 
</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">And
many other amazing populations !!!</span></p>
<p>
</p>
<p><b>The
author</b><span style=""font-weight: normal;""> : Hello, I'm Jerome Labadie, passionate painter of
figurines and player since long years.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Eager
to bring some innovations in the world of the skirmish game, i've
decided two years ago to create my game in order to regain the
pleasure of playing the ""common"" races of the fantasy
worlds on a small format. Like many of you I do not always have time
to align hundreds of figurines on huge tables. I was missing a game
for this, in order to preside with dignity to the sides of my
futuristic and post-apo confreres... This game has to be Furie.</span></p>
<p>
</p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">The
tests and the development of Furie were conducted from the
perspective of a lethal, fast, fun and little invading game, whether
it be of time or space. Being also a passioned player of RPG and
Video games, I inspired myself of the best principles of the both to
create Furie. Eager to see again Orcs, Elves, Goblins and other
Dwarves on the tables of skirmishes players, I worked the
personality, design and gameplay of each races of Eseltraia, with a
new approach to distinguish them from their more traditional
counterparts... Furie was born.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">In
December 2012, I created Whispe Editions in order to materialise this
idea and to bring you Furie. This game is inspired by the classics
and renews the kind. It will be supported by a consistent range of
products, with an ""interactive"" world, and dedicated to
evolve with the shares of its community.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Indeed,
over time the tournaments results and parties reports will affect the
timeline of the universe of the game (Will Ygmir be freed ? Will the
GSSR become a major power of the continent? Will the Esialdesiens
manage to carry the word of the Gods within the human colonies of the
Empire of Azerkelar ?), it is YOU who will influence all that !</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Rules
and army lists are free and in open access, allowing everyone to
enjoy the game on the medium of their choice (tablet computer or
paper) and avoiding to invest in too many books.</span></p>
<p>
</p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">The
game is played with some D10 on a table from 60 * 60 cm for 150
points of patrols to 60 * 120 cm for larger formats, with factions
ranging from 4 to 12 figurines according to the chosen army...</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Once
mastered, the play is fast, a game last between 30 minutes and 1 hour
for a 120 to 150 basis points... 6 scenarios are already online, and
will be regularly followed by others. For Furie, I opted for short
rules (the small formats don't require hundreds of pages of rules)
but full of subtleties and parameters that make tactical and gameplay
of each faction and each figurine unique.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Leaving
somewhat the intuitive side and tending towards oversimplification of
many games, I preferred the analysis and adaptation factors .</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">In
fact, you can easily know the combinations figurines/fighting stances
to use against various enemy units in order to impact them with the
most effectiveness .</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">The
special feature of the game lies in the ""Fury"", a bit like
in video games. Some ""officers"" of combatant type have the
capacity, while having accumulated enough Fury's points, of launching
a fighting technique that can turn the course of a game if it's well
managed. The rules are currently available in French
and are being translated into English !</span></p>
<p>With
Furie, play differently !</p>
<h2>Why this Indiegogo ?</h2>
<p>
</p>
<p><i style=""font-weight: normal;"">Develop a figurines game
results in substantial costs, whether it be for sculpture, molding,
illustration or communication.<br/>In order to provide to the peoples
of Eseltraia  the chance to live one day, I need your help. Indeed,
if these costs are easy to cover by large companies with substantial
financial support, the emerging businesses, wishing to provide its
players with a maximum of free content and quality molding parts,
need the help of the impassioned !</i></p>
<p><i style=""font-weight: normal;"">Whispe Editions has a lot
of ideas, dreams and projects, for figurines, role-playing games or
wargames (trays). Fury is the first stone of a building which I hope
will grow with and for his players. Each of your contributions will
be a great help for the construction of this building...</i></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><i><b>What will be developed
with this indiegogo ?</b></i></p>
<p>
</p>
<p><i style=""font-weight: normal;"">The purpose of this
indiegogo is to finance and support the sculpture and the molding of
Goblins, Yetis, Elves as well as many mercenaries and special
figurines. In addition, I intend to bind this one to a large painting
competition and, in the longer term to a campaign that will allow to
write the fate of Eseltraia. Each battle report will be taken into
account and according to the results of each faction (with the
proportion players/results) the geopolitical balance of the world can
switch at any time !</i></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><i><b>How will take place the
campaign ?</b></i></p>
<p>
</p>
<p><i style=""font-weight: normal;"">The campaign will consist
of two phases, presentation and teasing phase, on facebook :
<a href=""https://www.facebook.com/furie.thegame"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://www.facebook.com/furie.thegame</a>,
on the Forum : <a href=""http://furie-the-game.forumactif.com/I"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://furie-the-game.forumactif.com/</a>,
and especially on our new website : <a href=""http://www.furie-le-jeu.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.furie-le-jeu.com</a>.</i></p>
<p><i style=""line-height: 1.45em;""><b>I invite you to share
this campaign to a maximum of people in order to make this indiegogo
a success.</b>..</i></p>
<p><i style=""font-weight: normal;"">Then, once the campaign
is launched, and according to its evolution, numerous stretch goals
will be announced and, if the objectives are achieved, unlocked. The
campaign's goal is to make you access Furie's figurines at more
attractive prices  and give you access to unique and surprising
exclusivenesses.</i></p>
<p><i style=""font-weight: normal;"">
Once the funds raised we will initiate or conclude the necessary
productions, and you will be contacted to confirm your contact
details in order to send you your figurines in the course of the next
winter.</i></p>
<p><i style=""font-weight: normal;"">
Once that everyone has received its figurines, the Furie painting
competition will be launched on internet, with a prize depending on
the level of financing reached !!!</i></p>
<p><i style=""font-weight: normal;"">
In addition, each figurine proposed in the indiegogo can be
individually added to your pledges to the cost indicated in the list
below.</i></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>

About
Furie and Whispe Editions 




Furie : A powerful, fast and lethal
skirmish game, in an ancient arcanepunk universe...  where each
faction is defined by its psychology as well as by its powers, giving
a unique « touch » to the different populations on the battlefield.




At
the heart of a continent dominated by an orcish Empire on the
decline, endless Dwarf caravans flee the return of powerful Yetis,
servants of the god of winter, Ygmir, battles rages !!!
Will
you decide to join the expansionary Goblin Soviet Republic, who
according to the wisest men could soon become the greatest power of
the continent ? Will you be a preacher of the usurpers Gods from the
stars in the heart of the Kingdom of Esialdes ? Will you contribute
to spread the madness of the elfic hordes on the continent ? 

And
many other amazing populations !!!


The
author : Hello, I'm Jerome Labadie, passionate painter of
figurines and player since long years.
Eager
to bring some innovations in the world of the skirmish game, i've
decided two years ago to create my game in order to regain the
pleasure of playing the ""common"" races of the fantasy
worlds on a small format. Like many of you I do not always have time
to align hundreds of figurines on huge tables. I was missing a game
for this, in order to preside with dignity to the sides of my
futuristic and post-apo confreres... This game has to be Furie.


The
tests and the development of Furie were conducted from the
perspective of a lethal, fast, fun and little invading game, whether
it be of time or space. Being also a passioned player of RPG and
Video games, I inspired myself of the best principles of the both to
create Furie. Eager to see again Orcs, Elves, Goblins and other
Dwarves on the tables of skirmishes players, I worked the
personality, design and gameplay of each races of Eseltraia, with a
new approach to distinguish them from their more traditional
counterparts... Furie was born.
In
December 2012, I created Whispe Editions in order to materialise this
idea and to bring you Furie. This game is inspired by the classics
and renews the kind. It will be supported by a consistent range of
products, with an ""interactive"" world, and dedicated to
evolve with the shares of its community.
Indeed,
over time the tournaments results and parties reports will affect the
timeline of the universe of the game (Will Ygmir be freed ? Will the
GSSR become a major power of the continent? Will the Esialdesiens
manage to carry the word of the Gods within the human colonies of the
Empire of Azerkelar ?), it is YOU who will influence all that !
Rules
and army lists are free and in open access, allowing everyone to
enjoy the game on the medium of their choice (tablet computer or
paper) and avoiding to invest in too many books.


The
game is played with some D10 on a table from 60 * 60 cm for 150
points of patrols to 60 * 120 cm for larger formats, with factions
ranging from 4 to 12 figurines according to the chosen army...
Once
mastered, the play is fast, a game last between 30 minutes and 1 hour
for a 120 to 150 basis points... 6 scenarios are already online, and
will be regularly followed by others. For Furie, I opted for short
rules (the small formats don't require hundreds of pages of rules)
but full of subtleties and parameters that make tactical and gameplay
of each faction and each figurine unique.
Leaving
somewhat the intuitive side and tending towards oversimplification of
many games, I preferred the analysis and adaptation factors .
In
fact, you can easily know the combinations figurines/fighting stances
to use against various enemy units in order to impact them with the
most effectiveness .
The
special feature of the game lies in the ""Fury"", a bit like
in video games. Some ""officers"" of combatant type have the
capacity, while having accumulated enough Fury's points, of launching
a fighting technique that can turn the course of a game if it's well
managed. The rules are currently available in French
and are being translated into English !
With
Furie, play differently !
Why this Indiegogo ?


Develop a figurines game
results in substantial costs, whether it be for sculpture, molding,
illustration or communication.In order to provide to the peoples
of Eseltraia  the chance to live one day, I need your help. Indeed,
if these costs are easy to cover by large companies with substantial
financial support, the emerging businesses, wishing to provide its
players with a maximum of free content and quality molding parts,
need the help of the impassioned !
Whispe Editions has a lot
of ideas, dreams and projects, for figurines, role-playing games or
wargames (trays). Fury is the first stone of a building which I hope
will grow with and for his players. Each of your contributions will
be a great help for the construction of this building...




What will be developed
with this indiegogo ?


The purpose of this
indiegogo is to finance and support the sculpture and the molding of
Goblins, Yetis, Elves as well as many mercenaries and special
figurines. In addition, I intend to bind this one to a large painting
competition and, in the longer term to a campaign that will allow to
write the fate of Eseltraia. Each battle report will be taken into
account and according to the results of each faction (with the
proportion players/results) the geopolitical balance of the world can
switch at any time !




How will take place the
campaign ?


The campaign will consist
of two phases, presentation and teasing phase, on facebook :
https://www.facebook.com/furie.thegame,
on the Forum : http://furie-the-game.forumactif.com/,
and especially on our new website : http://www.furie-le-jeu.com.
I invite you to share
this campaign to a maximum of people in order to make this indiegogo
a success...
Then, once the campaign
is launched, and according to its evolution, numerous stretch goals
will be announced and, if the objectives are achieved, unlocked. The
campaign's goal is to make you access Furie's figurines at more
attractive prices  and give you access to unique and surprising
exclusivenesses.

Once the funds raised we will initiate or conclude the necessary
productions, and you will be contacted to confirm your contact
details in order to send you your figurines in the course of the next
winter.

Once that everyone has received its figurines, the Furie painting
competition will be launched on internet, with a prize depending on
the level of financing reached !!!

In addition, each figurine proposed in the indiegogo can be
individually added to your pledges to the cost indicated in the list
below.




How can you tell us what
you want ?
Once your
subscription registered, indicate in the comment the chosen
figurines. If goodies and stretchs goals are reached, you can simply
add your choice in the comments. The requested goods will be
delivered before the end of the first quarter 2014.
And you can change your
choice until the announcement of sending orders by contacting us !

Character Customization: Give your character a custom name, change its pattern, colors and body parts, such as horns or tail tips or choose from pre-made textures.

Character Leveling: Complete tasks, quests and events to level your character and make it stronger. Spend talent points to increase your dragon's traits.
​Optional PvP: Play on servers without being afraid of being attacked by other players. Simply disable PvP in your character profile and enable it if you want to have a battle with someone else. 

Group and Clan System: Go on your journey and bring your friends with you by inviting them to your group or creating your own clan, which allows you to announce events and keep track of your members progress. 

Create useful items:  Build a hoard to hide all your treasures in, create objects which improve your dragons stats or add temporary buffs.

Nesting: Build and defend a nest and raise your own dragon hatchling.

Questing: Find and complete several one-time and repeatable quests.
​Interactive Environment:  Interact with several objects in your environment to gain useful buffs or uncover more parts of the story.

Dragon Dens: Earn yourself a place you can call home. Unlock and upgrade your own den to live a more comfortable dragon life.  
​NO EXCLUSIVE CONTENTEvery character, pattern, object or skin added by our backers will be available to everyone, who owns the game. Locking content behind paywalls can ruin the experience of players, who are not able to afford additional items.We think that creating something for the game and being able to say ""I designed this!"" can feel just as rewarding as owning a texture that is limited to a few people. OUR DRAGONSWILDLIFEYou will also encounter and be able to play as a variety of wild life. These characters will be very basic in terms of game play, but due to high interest, we decided to add them to the list of playable creatures.STRETCH GOALSIf the core game gets funded we will put all additional money into our stretch goals to add more mechanics and content which will be available to everyone who owns the game.The skill tree system will allow players to change the elements of their dragon, increase stats and unlock powerful attacks. Each attack has custom effects and sometimes status effects, which will help you in battles. This goal adds additional hatchling and elder models for each main species. New characters will hatch from eggs and appear as little hatchlings until they reach a high enough level which allows them to grow to the next stage. Veteran players get to unlock an elder dragon version of their species, which indicates that they have reached the current maximum level. The world of Draconia is inhabited by dragon people, which we call ""Ka'sai"". Unlocking this perk will make them a playable species. This includes: ​Professions: Such as farming, scavenging and herbalism. Advanced play style: Use different weapons such as bows, daggers and swords to defend yourself.Advanced crafting: Adds additional craft-able items such as a furnace, which allows players to make weapons and tools from different materials and unlocks the ability to add bonus items, which increase specific stats. Classes: Adds Ka'Sai classes such as warriors, hunters, shamans and dragon breeders, which have specific base stats and add special skills to a characterDragon riding: Will allow the player to ride dragons. This mechanic is difficult to work on and is therefor included in the highest stretch goal.BUDGETAlready confirmed character models, level art & level design will be self-funded to keep the minimum goal low. Reaching the needed budget will also allow us to hire additional programmers and other needed team members, which will greatly speed up the development progress. SOCIAL LINKS",19.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h2><strong>HOW IS XOLOTL DIFFERENT FROM OTHER PETSITE/RPGs?</strong></h2>
<p>Not only are we one of the first to combine the features of a traditional petsite and roleplaying game, we are also unique in that we are offering a game to an older, more mature audience. Xolotl is geared towards users 16+, and aims to have a strong sense of community with helpful, mature players dedicated to improving gameplay.</p>
<p>In addition, Xolotl features a stunning world breathtakingly illustrated under the lead of concept artist and illustrator Ilse Gort.

<p>Xolotl has a uniquely fair and affordable subscription-based system that encourages a friendly community by making all players equal.

<p>To top it all off, Xolotl is a game created and developed by women! A majority of our staff team are female gaming enthusiasts and entrepeneurs, hoping to bring a new and unique gaming experience to their audience!</p>

<p>Hi all,<br/> it's been a while so I thought I should check in. We have been dutifully working on Archive, Memoria Technica to get it to you as soon as we can. We have since solved a spanner problem which is now working beautifully and will in fact be putting a new demo together for all of you soon. <br/></p>
<p>As we did not reach our goal we are still out there looking for additional funding, so please rest assure we have not forsaken you all we've just been busy.<br/></p>
<p>Thank you all for believing in us and contributing to our game :) <br/></p>

<p>Thank you all for contributing to Archive Memoria Technica <br/></p>
<p>Have no fear,  although we did not currently reach our goal we WILL  be making this game and yes we will be looking for the additional funding we need elsewhere. Our first big goal will be to attend PAX-E in Boston, and you have definitely helped us to get there so thank you again and we will keep you posted as things progress. </p>
<p>This game is going to be finished, no matter what! <br/></p>

<h2>What is Archive?<br/>
</h2>
<p></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""></span></p>
<p>Misfit Children and Hypermetric Studios are proud to announce our flagship title, <b>Archive, Memoria Technica</b>. The game is a top-down dual-stick shooter in the tradition of <b>Robotron:2084</b> or <b>Geometry Wars</b>, coupled with the strategic customization of a tower defense game.  <br/></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/139207/files/20131017141915-Trailer2__0-00-29-06_.jpg?1382044755"" src="""" style=""""/></p> </span></span></span><p>Players can customize their ship's weaponry, choosing from an array of weapon types, and toggle them between AI control or manual fire, controlling the map and your resources. <br/><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""></span></span></p>

<p></p>
<p>Replayability is a key feature in Archive, and so in addition to the huge number of combinations of customizable weapons you control, our adaptive AI enemy spawning system ensures that gameplay feels freshly challenging in your first or fiftieth game. Rather than building levels with fixed enemies and waves, we were inspired by <b>Left For Dead</b>'s AI Director and built our engine to act similarly. It reacts to how you play and adjusts the enemies to provide the greatest challenge possible. Combined with our adaptive music system, it ensures a fresh feel to each game.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/139209/files/20131017141953-Trailer2__0-00-33-19_.jpg?1382044793"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>The
game has an Indian/Hindu theme, and its story is inspired by a fascinating Hindu text called
the Bhagavad Gita. This two and a half thousand year old poem is a discussion
about the morality and nature of death and war. Almost everyone knows at least
one line from it: ""I am become Death, destroyer of worlds"". </p>
<p>The fundamental
question of <b>Archive </b>is this: after you die, which is more valuable? A perfect
record of your life made by a stranger, or the imperfect memories you record
yourself? <br/></p>

<h1>What is left to do? </h1>
<p>Well . . . a lot. </p>
<p>Will and I have been working off our savings for the last couple of years of development, and now we need help for the final 6 months of dev time to get the game completed. </p>
<p>There is a lot that needs to get done to get the game across the finish line. So far gameplay is feeling good, and the reaction to our game so far has been great! We have shown it at Toronto's Gamercamp Festival, Boston's PAX, and San Francisco's GDC, where popular reaction to the game was solid. </p>
<p>. . . But we need more content. We need to finish up the campaign levels, set up the gauntlet modes for competitive leaderboard play, add more music, enemies, weapons, and bosses, and really polish the hell out of this thing.  </p>
<p>There are also some more techy things we need to do, like get our online back-end up and running for the leaderboards and forums, and finish tweaking the AI spawning system. </p>
<p>We are optimistic about finishing things up in about 5-6 months, but we can only put in the hours to make that happen if we have something to live on. If this game feels like something you want to play, please help us make it a reality!</p>

This summer I would like to complete a 5,000 mile bicycle trip from Florida to Oregon. The tour will be completely self supported and we will be camping throughout the trip. This trip will be extremely difficult but I want to seek out opportunities that will change my life in a positive way. The tour will offer many opportunities for personal growth and I would not ask you to fund this project if I did not believe it would increase my capacity to serve my community. During the next four months I will be taking at risk youth on twenty day canoe trips here in Florida. This work is extremely important to me but I will be working for significantly less than minimum wage. I try to live a humble and simple life and to dedicate my time to causes that I care about. This is not the first time that I have worked for low wages in order to do work that I believe in. After college I spent two years as an Americorps member completing full time services work. During this time I gutted flood damaged houses, built affordable housing for low income families, recruited volunteers, counseled youth and organized for the Special Olympics National Games. Over the past two years I have been working to complete my Masters in Public Administration with a focus in nonprofit management. During this time I volunteered as a sexual assault advocate in my community and created an advocacy group at my school to campaign for more comprehensive services for survivors of sexual assault.</p><p>The work that I have done has been invaluable to me and changed my life in ways that are incredibly meaningful to me. However, due to the low wage I earn at my job I will not be able to complete this trip without financial assistance. I am committed to completing this trip as cheaply as possible. This will mean camping throughout the trip and carrying and cooking all of our food.

<p>We created Sock Invaders to try to put more fun and pop culture into designer socks. We figured it should be possible to have the bold designs and colours, but also have more than simply lines and dots. Why not patterns or characters that give us fond memories and make us smile?

<p><u><strong>The Kickstarter Campaign</strong></u></p>
<p>This was one of the most exciting months of our lives and the result was totally unexpected. With no marketing budget and no influencers to spread the word, we thought it would be a tough task to reach our modest funding goal.

We kept thinking the mid campaign lull was upon us, only to get another surge of backers seemingly from no where.

<p>We are two best friends working on this who first met at age 11 at secondary school and have been good friends ever since. Jonathan has been working on socks for about 5 years now, starting out with a kids character socks brand. He also teaches kids English in Asia and is a bit of a hardcore gamer and some would say the main driving force behind Sock Invaders. Andre lives in London and joined the project in 2017, helping to get Sock Invaders off the ground. He pretty much only plays Fifa and Call of Duty, but we're working on changing that!</p>

<p><u><strong>What next for Sock Invaders?</strong></u></p>
<p>Well, this is only the very beginning. Our long term goal is to work with indie video game developers and artists and collaborate on sock designs inspired by their work. Until then, we have a number of ideas for the next range and hope to become an indie sock company with a passionate customer base who look forward to seeing what designs we come up with next. We also look forward to making a difference in the lives of the less fortunate through much needed sock donations to local charities.</p>

<ul><li>RedKey USB addresses the problem of your personal information being discovered when a computer is disposed of or scrapped. Privacy breaches are a constant threat. Equifax and the recent Facebook breach with Cambridge Analytica is a warning to all computer users. </li></ul>
<ul><li>Personal information or ""data"" as it is commonly known, can easily be retrieved from computers, even after it's been deleted. After the Redkey is used, this is no longer the case. RedKey USB eliminates the threat of someone accessing your personal data. Without it, you are vulnerable to a privacy breach.</li></ul>
<ul><li>If you ever plan to sell, recycle or even just give-away a computer, you need this product. Use the RedKey USB to protect your privacy. </li></ul>
<ul><li>RedKey USB is specifically designed to be easy to use and is suitable for home and business use. Simply plug it into a USB port, then switch on power to initiate a wipe. It is designed to work automatically, and minimal technical knowledge is required. This is the first product of its kind. It's a powerful &amp; useful tool. Now you can quickly wipe all of your old computers - effortlessly and securely.</li></ul>
<ul><li>Using the Redkey USB is intuitive and it is supplied with a detailed instruction pamphlet too. Support is available through the dedicated <a href=""http://redkeyusb.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">redkeyusb.com </a>website.</li></ul>
<ul><li>RedKey USB works on most computers - PC's, Desktops, Laptops, and Mac's made after 2006, The software also works on computers with SSD drives. </li></ul>
<ul><li>An optional advanced menu area is built in to the device where settings can be tweaked. </li></ul>
<ul><li>The data erase algorithm is highly secure. The Redkey looks like an ordinary USB stick, but it is completely different - it is designed to erase data - not store it. </li></ul>
<ul><li>RedKey USB automatically wipes when inserted to make it easy to use. It will also work on partially broken PC's, as in when PC's have missing keys, broken screen, or are otherwise malfunctioning. Automatic start overcomes such problems, and for safety reasons, there is a 60-second grace period before the program starts which helps prevent any mistaken use.</li></ul>
<ul><li>RedKey USB includes audio beeps so that you can hear when a PC has been wiped which is useful if you cannot see the screen of a PC. A computer will beep 5 times every 5 minutes once it has been wiped. </li></ul>
<ul><li>RedKey USB is a business start-up project based in the UK, with collaboration from manufacturers and partners worldwide. The hardware technology is supplied from the USA.

</div></div>","Simply hitting delete or resetting, doesn’t guarantee your Data is actually gone.
Redkey is the solution you need, to wipe any computer 100% safely & securely. 
It looks like an ordinary USB stick, but it’s completely different - It’s designed to erase Data, not store it! Simply plug it in to your computer before start-up, and initiate the wipe - with the easy to use system that’s embedded in to the key.
Stop worrying about that old PC or Mac that’s taking up space. Choose Redkey USB & your Data will truly be gone forever!
A handy BlueKey 16 GB memory stick is also supplied in each Kit. The Bluekey is ideal for storing files on prior to wiping. Also included is a handy set of lanyards for stowage and a set of cool stickers. 






RedKey USB addresses the problem of your personal information being discovered when a computer is disposed of or scrapped. Privacy breaches are a constant threat. Equifax and the recent Facebook breach with Cambridge Analytica is a warning to all computer users. 
Personal information or ""data"" as it is commonly known, can easily be retrieved from computers, even after it's been deleted. After the Redkey is used, this is no longer the case. RedKey USB eliminates the threat of someone accessing your personal data. Without it, you are vulnerable to a privacy breach.
If you ever plan to sell, recycle or even just give-away a computer, you need this product. Use the RedKey USB to protect your privacy. 
RedKey USB is specifically designed to be easy to use and is suitable for home and business use. Simply plug it into a USB port, then switch on power to initiate a wipe. It is designed to work automatically, and minimal technical knowledge is required. This is the first product of its kind. It's a powerful & useful tool. Now you can quickly wipe all of your old computers - effortlessly and securely.
Using the Redkey USB is intuitive and it is supplied with a detailed instruction pamphlet too. Support is available through the dedicated redkeyusb.com website.
RedKey USB works on most computers - PC's, Desktops, Laptops, and Mac's made after 2006, The software also works on computers with SSD drives. 
An optional advanced menu area is built in to the device where settings can be tweaked. 
The data erase algorithm is highly secure. The Redkey looks like an ordinary USB stick, but it is completely different - it is designed to erase data - not store it. 
RedKey USB automatically wipes when inserted to make it easy to use. It will also work on partially broken PC's, as in when PC's have missing keys, broken screen, or are otherwise malfunctioning. Automatic start overcomes such problems, and for safety reasons, there is a 60-second grace period before the program starts which helps prevent any mistaken use.
RedKey USB includes audio beeps so that you can hear when a PC has been wiped which is useful if you cannot see the screen of a PC. A computer will beep 5 times every 5 minutes once it has been wiped. 
RedKey USB is a business start-up project based in the UK, with collaboration from manufacturers and partners worldwide. The hardware technology is supplied from the USA. The Software has been developed within Europe. Some components and packaging are supplied from China, the Netherlands and from local suppliers in the UK.

</div></div>","This is a photorealistic logic game which leads you to several different Worlds. A couple of these: historical moments (famous wars, conquest of America, etc.), fictional characters (superheroes, vampires, zombies, etc.), everyday stories.







Every diorama has a new problem to solve, your mission is to find the right order. Pay attention for the details, because they can mess it all up even though they are just a little bit different than the right solution. The Characters’ speech bubbles always help to find the clue.


The basic concept was to create a new game (as indie) which can easily cope with the big ones but still can be made by just a couple people.





I choose the Story Style on purpose, because I made 3D animations for films, commercials for 21 years. First of all I decided to find a directive which is a very professional visual imaginery world where I can use my experience. My partner (we are two of us in the project) is responsible for the 2D elements and models.

Our biggest fear was not being able to work together, but we can easily share the tasks and we make a pretty good team. We share almost every minute together so it is not uncommon we are brainstorming all the time.
We had some attempts at IOS and Android but having 3D experiences it was disturbing that the graphical possibilities are limited on mobile.
So I chose PC!

Our plan is to create lots of new games and to come out with innovative new ideas every year.


Miniature is a big step for us to settle in the world of creating games.
Unfortunately our capacity is not enough anymore. The Game Engine is basically ready, but it still needs refinement. According to the fact we are just two of us, creating each scene takes a very long time. This is the reason why we are planing to deal with this in full time.
The most important tasks:



modeling and texturing new scenes


creating new stories


making animations


creating and building in sounds and music 


bug fixing (fixing problems and troubleshooting)


porting to several different platforms


First we would like to come up on Steam (PC, Mac, Linux) but we have plans to do the same on other ports like Xbox One, etc… If the selling goes well Playstation 4 is also a possibility.





We can create more scenes and we can also make the game compatible with VR so you can feel yourself like Gulliver in the World of Lilliput. To make this happen we would need at least 5000$ for financial support.





If we get less we can make fewer scenes then we planed.


At first the biggest problem was to choose the proper game engine as we were new on the developing market. After hesitating for ages we chose Unreal Engine 4. Its way of thinking specifically made for artists made it possible the lack of  using help from outside (a programmer for example...).According to the fact my best skills are creating visual sceneries, programmig was the biggest challenge. It wasn't the only problem to deal with creating the engine of Miniature, but also inventing a brand new way of game mode.


If you are not able to support our project but you like Miniature you would be very helpful to share it on Indiegogo.",18.0,0,"1 Campaign

Playing college golf, I always found myself being the worst putter on the course. To fix this, I designed a game that helped me train.   I played the game with all of my friends and it was so enjoyable that before long my house was the hangout. 
 
While attending the University of Wyoming I entered the game of Gilliards into a business plan competition and successfully won $2,500.  The game was such a hit that I easily assembled a Board of Directors including the Dean of College of Business, Branch Manager of First interstate Bank and a couple other prominent local business people and professors.  At the discretion of the board, our funds were quickly used for focus group testing and R&D.  

The good news, we know people really enjoy the game!
Now I am back to the basics of fun and entertainment.   We are asking for your help to produce the  Gilliards video game.
 
The Video Game
Be careful the Gilliards video game could be very addicting.  The game itself seems very simple so you always think you can do better which leads you to try try and try again.  The scoring is also infinite making for ever increasing records.  Tthis game is very streaky making for low lows and high highs which draws a general intrigue from the player.   
 
The game will feature both EASY and Tournament modes which is a difference in scoring.  In EASY mode only the gilliards points are counted.  In Tournmanet mode you get points for a kiss and larger combos.  We will also have 3 different rail lengths that are used to make the game easier or harder, this is our handicapping system.
 

Future of Gilliards

The future of Gilliards is unknown but you will help write it. Please become involved with our project.  Even if you cannot help fund it please provide feedback or comments all are greatly appreciated!

At each funding level we have outlined our plans

<p><b></b></p>
<p style=""font-style: italic;""><i><b>Will the 5 big features be available to everyone on Puca for free?  </b></i></p>
<p>Yes. If this campaign succeeds, support for digital cards, condition, non-English, quantity, and mobile will be available at the Common (free) tier of membership on PucaTrade. </p>
<b><i>Why can't you just pay for this yourself?</i></b>
</div>
<div>
<p>The reality is that we receive a tremendous amount of feature requests for new trading tools and inventory support from members of our community. Whenever we can, we do our best to provide these at no cost to our members. Although we do work tirelessly to maintain and improve the site, there are currently financial bottlenecks that are preventing us from tackling these 5 huge features for the community right now.  The success of this campaign will effectively remove these bottlenecks and allow us to pour the resources necessary into the accomplishment of these goals.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Additionally, this campaign will enable meaningful partnerships with other MTG resources within the Magic Online community, for broader feature capability on PucaTrade and API integration with trusted sources. </p>
<p>Since its inception, PucaTrade has always been a community-supported project.  At every opportunity, we've always chosen to finance our endeavors with payment structures that are optional to our members.  Your generosity has gotten us where we are today, and will continue to guide us towards a better future. </p>
<p>
</p>
<p><i><b>Shouldn't all these features cost, like, 1,000 bucks?</b></i></p>
<p>Unfortunately no, the reality is that PucaTrade is a highly sophisticated web application that is more like a small city or ecosystem than a simple website.  Magic online is similar in terms of its complexity. Integrating these to ecosystems is an incredible undertaking, but it's one our highly trained development team knows they can execute on.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Know that we have extremely high standards for the features we create; we would never settle for poorly written code or shoddy technology. We’d never risk the security of your personal information to untrained developers who promise more than they can deliver.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The budget we proposed is what it will take to get the job done right. This is why we chose the fixed funding instead of the flexible funding funding option.</p>
<p></p>
<p><i><b>Why don’t you go and raise venture capital from an investor? </b></i></p>
<p>The average size of early-stage rounds of seed-funding is $1 million these days.  While the allure of this amount of money is undeniable, we acknowledge that it often comes with a significant loss of control. If this control was yielded to someone who placed profit-motives above our company mission, the result could potentially be disastrous for our community.  </p>
<p>Staying focussed on the needs of the Magic community is paramount to our mission, and we simply haven’t met an investor who intuitively understands that. </p>
<p>With your help we can accomplish our goals and keep PucaTrade community-focused, community-owned, and community-supported.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><i><b>If the campaign succeeds, how will the financial resources be allocated? </b></i></p>
<p>Setting aside the 2% we have allocated for rewards and fulfillment, here's our forecast for development costs, by feature: </p>

</div>
</div></div>","We did it!  Thanks so much to everyone who supported this campaign!If you missed the chance to contribute, but still want to help head over to PucaTrade to participate!  We offer subscription memberships and other sweet  rewards for people who want to maximize their trading experience and support the world's best MtG trading economy. All funds generated from everything we offer on the site are allocated towards growth and development of our free trading community. 
Thanks for checking  this project out, and thanks in advance for your support!



Since 2011 our mission at PucaTrade has been to make Magic: The Gathering more accessible to everyone. We have accomplished this by providing a safe, fast, and fun place for you to trade with speed and confidence together with over 40,000 Magic players from all over the world.  And now, as you requested, it's time to go further. 




When you speak, we listen.  So it's with great pleasure that we embark on the journey towards the development of these 5 features:


MTGO Trading (Trade Between Digital & Paper Cards) - For the first time in history you'll be able to trade your MODO Elspeth for a paper Jace, and vice-versa. You'll also be able to trade PucaPoints for MTGO Event Tickets as well.  This is groundbreaking.  Get excited!

Non-English Cards - Looking for a Japanese Foil or two?  Now's your chance to receive cards in any language you choose. 


Card Condition - We all love Magic cards, and some cards are more loved than others.  With this new feature you will be able to grade your card based on it's condition, and trade-values will adjust accordingly. 


Modern Mobile Experience - The mobile experience is a huge priority for us.  25% of our members access the site from a mobile device, and our goal is to utilize responsive design to craft an elegant experience for our traders on the move.

Quantity Trading/Shipping - Want a playset of Birds of Paradise in any black-bordered version?  This feature lets you manage all versions of a card you would accept, and  allows you to bundle your trades together as packages. 





The landscape of Magic Online card exchange will completely change. With Magic Online cards coming to PucaTrade, you will be able to:




Trade for digital cards, event tickets, or sealed product using our user-friendly website and then log into Magic Online to pick them up any time later.

Exchange Magic Online items for their fair market price, through peer-to-peer trade with other Magic players. 

Support other players by directly satisfying their needs and wants, as well as your own.

Acquire factory-sealed, complete paper sets of Standard-legal (and recently Standard-legal) cards via collecting digital cards and using the Magic Online redemption system- in regular or foil versions.

Turn paper Magic cards into Magic Online cards or the other way around. Never has the transition from digital to paper and back again been so smooth.

Besides all of the features listed above, we have a ton of other development goals we can't wait to get cracking on. 
Any funds raised over our initial amount will finance these hot new features:

Support for collector's edition.
Delete inbox messages.
""Bounties"" that allow you to offer more points for cards you really want.
Visibility on other peoples' trade binders.
Enhanced filtration on the search page.

</div></div>","The Beginning:J4 Paintball started back in 2013 with what was to be the most exciting, innovative and most anticipated paintball marker to date, The Torque. A completely new platform never attempted in paintball before. After years of prototypes, a Patent not just pending but awarded, the first Stacked Tube Spool (STS) gun was brought to the paintball industry. In 2009, the United States Patent Office awarded J4 Paintball the exclusive patent on the STS platform, and with much hard work and determination, the Torque was released to market in 2014.But, as do many other companies who try to push the boundaries of design have experienced, there are more challenges. The crew at J4 ran into our fair share, and we resolved those. 
We had some problems with the parts as a few were manufactured wrong. One of the parts threw off the whole dynamic of the gun, taking us a few months to figure out. We produced about 300 guns, sold 100 and then halted production. The next few months we worked on fixes, covering hundreds of test parts. We found out the parts throwing off the dynamic. We have all of the 'fixes' complete. 
We needed to replace:
The Bolt
The ASA Components

The Board

The Bolts are built and done, with enough extra to cover far more guns than are in the CF campaign. The ASA parts are mostly ran, with just one more part to produce, which the new Machinist is doing now. The Eye Mod and board are setup, and the Board is at v1.2 – The v1.1 board running with no problems so far at this time, with nearly 9 months in on testing, and there being only one small change for v1.2.

QC needs to be done in house, to not rely on outside parties to deliver that for you. 
Being open and honest with everybody every step of the way is very important.
Innovation is demanded by the customer - and they appreciate companies that work on it. 

With 200 guns raw and in storage we now have a great opportunity to make it back to market. 




What We Need & What You Get
We have the parts ran, or the CAD ready. We have new boards designed and tested. We need to QC, anodize and assemble 200 guns. We will do this in a couple stages, with the first stage paying for the next:

It will allow us to manufacture the NEW v1.2 Boards3.Complete the eye modifications on all of the guns already produced4. It will cover Anodizing on all of the parts we currently have produced and finally it will cover the assembly and shipping of all of our current inventory.

In LEVEL 22 you play as Gary, an average office employee. Gary has a bad habit, he is
always late at work. The problem is that if it happens again, he will certainly
be fired. And guess what, after a night of party, Gary is late again. Your
objective: help Gary to reach his desk without being spotted by his colleagues.
You are going to run, hide, and think fast if you want to have a chance to
reach the LEVEL 22.</p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">LEVEL 22,
Gary’s Misadventures is a Stealth Comedy Game. Our goal was to pay tribute to a
genre that really fascinated us. We borrowed some fundamental gameplay elements
from classics stealth games and mixed it with a silly plot and an eccentric pixel-arted
universe. The idea was to turn the traditionally sad working place into a
childish playground. We wanted to make the player remember the time when he/she
was a kid playing hide and seek. LEVEL 22 is also a way to experiment things
that would normally be impossible in the real life. Being violent with your
boss and lurking under a cardboard box are not exactly what can be considered
acceptable in the usual professional context. But even if “transgression” is
often the key of success in this game, you will also have to think a lot.
Reflection (and a little bit of timing, of course) will constantly be your main
weapon to face the threat of unemployment.</p>

a strategy to avoid your colleagues’ fields of visions. Along your way, you
will have to find many different items and learn how to use them properly.</p>

conveyor belts can often be good ways to avoid getting into troubles.</p>

22, Gary’s Misadventures peut se définir comme une « comédie
d’infiltration ». Notre souhait était avant tout de rendre hommage et
s’inscrire dans un genre qui compte beaucoup pour nous celui de l’infiltration.
Nous avons emprunté des éléments de gameplay fondamentaux de grands classiques
de l’infiltration et les avons intégrés par le biais d’un pitch des plus
absurde,  à un univers excentrique tout
en pixel art. L’idée était de transformer le morne monde du travail en un
terrain de jeu coloré, dynamique et surtout complétement puéril.  Nous voulons rappeler au joueur l’époque où,
enfant, il jouait à se cacher, faisait des bêtises et était capable de transformer
tous les objets du quotidien en jouets potentiels. </p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">LEVEL 22 représente aussi
l’occasion unique d’expérimenter des choses qui en temps normal, serait
impossible à reproduire dans le monde réel. Par exemple, être violent avec ses
supérieurs hiérarchiques et se balader sous une boite en carton n’est
malheureusement pas exactement ce que l’on peut considérer comme un comportement
socialement acceptable. Mais bien que la transgression soit assez
systématiquement la clef du succès au cours de l’aventure, il va vous falloir pas
mal faire marcher vos méninges  pour

In LEVEL 22 you play as Gary, an average office employee. Gary has a bad habit, he is
always late at work. The problem is that if it happens again, he will certainly
be fired. And guess what, after a night of party, Gary is late again. Your
objective: help Gary to reach his desk without being spotted by his colleagues.
You are going to run, hide, and think fast if you want to have a chance to
reach the LEVEL 22.



Play a light demo version here: http://www.noego-games.com/demo/

LEVEL 22,
Gary’s Misadventures is a Stealth Comedy Game. Our goal was to pay tribute to a
genre that really fascinated us. We borrowed some fundamental gameplay elements
from classics stealth games and mixed it with a silly plot and an eccentric pixel-arted
universe. The idea was to turn the traditionally sad working place into a
childish playground. We wanted to make the player remember the time when he/she
was a kid playing hide and seek. LEVEL 22 is also a way to experiment things
that would normally be impossible in the real life. Being violent with your
boss and lurking under a cardboard box are not exactly what can be considered
acceptable in the usual professional context. But even if “transgression” is
often the key of success in this game, you will also have to think a lot.
Reflection (and a little bit of timing, of course) will constantly be your main
weapon to face the threat of unemployment.












Your
objective is to find a way to reach the end of the level without being seen.
Each time you are spotted, you get a game over screen. You have to carefully
explore your environment, discover what can be used at your advantage and build
a strategy to avoid your colleagues’ fields of visions. Along your way, you
will have to find many different items and learn how to use them properly.







 Use you environment


Anything
can be useful! Hide in closets, in car trunks, under cardboard boxes or behind
newspapers. You may also find handy to crawl through air vents and booby trap
photocopiers or computers. Playing as Gary will surely make you realize that,
as surprising as it seems, kicking vending machines and moving around on
conveyor belts can often be good ways to avoid getting into troubles.






 Neutralize your co-worker

Teach these
snitches a good lesson! What about baiting them with a donut so you can move
them out of your way?  You can also put
some laxative or radioactive substances on it to keep them busy for a while. Well,
if you think these methods are to extreme you can subtly attract their
attention by throwing erasers at them or, less subtly, knocking them out with a
big book.






 Discover secrets

Your best
friend, Marty, is a former employee of the company, he will guide you all
through the game using his cellphone. Marty has a black belt degree in slacking. He
will teach you every trick he knows but he won’t do it for nothing. You will be
asked to get him back his beloved collection of collectible Toys he lost when
he got fired. Localize them and gather them all. Oh, and by the way, there are
also these strange safes all around the building. Will you find them all? Will
you crack their codes?









A Pc, Mac and Linux version of the game
Level 22, Gary’s
Misadventures has already been released on iPad and android tablet Pc. We are
launching that Indiegogo campaign to finance the additional cost of development
related to programming, debugging, re-balancing and testing for the Pc, Mac and
Linux version. We have already had many requests to port the game to Pc but we actually can’t
afford it. The Indiegogo campaign is here to gather all those who believe in a computer
port of the game and want to be able to enjoy it in this platform.






You are like us? You don’t have money?
It’s ok,
but you certainly have a Facebook or Twitter account. Please, give us a like and follow us. It’s free and it really means a lot to us. You
could also have a look at our steam Greenlight page and give us your
support. Any help is welcomed! Oh and by the way, don't forget to try the demo and share your impressions with us.

Level 22 vous fait incarner Gary, un employé de bureau tout
ce qu’il y a de plus moyen. Notre héros possède une fâcheuse habitude : il
est constamment en retard. Le problème est que si cela se produit à nouveau il
sera certainement viré. Et, devinez quoi, après une soirée d’anniversaire bien
arrosée, Gary est encore en retard. Votre objectif : aider Gary à
atteindre son bureau sans se faire repérer par ses collègues.  Préparez-vous donc pour la partie de
cache-cache la plus épique de votre vie.

LEVEL
22, Gary’s Misadventures peut se définir comme une « comédie
d’infiltration ». Notre souhait était avant tout de rendre hommage et
s’inscrire dans un genre qui compte beaucoup pour nous celui de l’infiltration.
Nous avons emprunté des éléments de gameplay fondamentaux de grands classiques
de l’infiltration et les avons intégrés par le biais d’un pitch des plus
absurde,  à un univers excentrique tout
en pixel art. L’idée était de transformer le morne monde du travail en un
terrain de jeu coloré, dynamique et surtout complétement puéril.  Nous voulons rappeler au joueur l’époque où,
enfant, il jouait à se cacher, faisait des bêtises et était capable de transformer
tous les objets du quotidien en jouets potentiels. LEVEL 22 représente aussi
l’occasion unique d’expérimenter des choses qui en temps normal, serait
impossible à reproduire dans le monde réel. Par exemple, être violent avec ses
supérieurs hiérarchiques et se balader sous une boite en carton n’est
malheureusement pas exactement ce que l’on peut considérer comme un comportement
socialement acceptable. Mais bien que la transgression soit assez
systématiquement la clef du succès au cours de l’aventure, il va vous falloir pas
mal faire marcher vos méninges  pour
savoir comment la mettre en œuvre. Une bonne dose de réflexion (saupoudrée d’un
minimum de sens du timing) sera généralement votre meilleure arme pour
faire face à la menace du chômage.Votre

<p>Every turn begins with an event being sent to you via your abPadSung30000. After having a chance to confer with each one of your advisers, you make a choice as to how to deal with the event. Generally speaking, each event has a probable outcome that can be negative or positive to your current situation.

<p></p>Once the event is resolved you are brought to the main world map where the world is divided into 11 different regions, here you can influence the various regions by hiring and deploying armies of minions from your Earth base of Atlantis. The minion armies come in three types:<br/><p></p>

<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/222905/files/20131125141431-Minion_Types.png?1385417671"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><b><br/></b></p>
<ul><li>
<b>Enforcer </b>minions are soldiers and secret police. Their mission is to re-establish order in one of the world's regions and raise stability. In doing so, however, they also reduce the percentage of sheeple that region produces since the combat is bound to have unintended casualties.</li></ul>
<ul><li>
<b>Spinmeisters </b>are diplomats, reporters, politicians, lobbyists, and so on. Their job is to keep the population blissfully ignorant of all of your order's nefarious deeds, including it's existence! They increase the Sheeple percentage in a region, however all the media, gifts, bribes and escorts they have to hire end up costing their fair share of the resource produced in the region they are deployed in.</li></ul>
<ul><li>
<b>Resourcers'</b> jobs are to gather more resources in a region. However, since they are essentially stealing wealth from that region, they tend to cause stability to lower wherever they work.</li></ul>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Minion armies also have a cost both in Thralls and Resources. How much they cost of each depends on what type they are. Enforcer armies cost a lot of Thralls but they have a low Resource cost, while Spinmeisters don't require many Thralls, but have a high Resource cost. You will spend a number of turns saving up the resources and thralls in order to hire and deploy minion armies. You can also review the information on the world map to make sure you are gaining enough of all resource types to face The End Of The World. Be careful though! You only have until 2017 to prevent The End...and you can only ever afford up to 16 different minion units at once!</p>

</span></div>","It's all true. Every conspiracy you've ever heard. Aliens. Blackbaggings. The Illuminati. And you're in charge. (PC game: Windows).It's all true, every last bit. The Illuminati are real, Aliens are real, the New World Order is real, all governments are puppets put in power by the Earth's real masters ... and you're in charge of the whole operation. Take the head seat of the New World Lunar Order Council Base and decide the fate of the world, one crisis at a time.  

Conspiracy Prophecy 2017 is a game about resource management, minion management, decision making and humor. 

You begin the game enjoying a moment of happiness, congratulating your advisers on having stopped the Mayan end of the world prophecy of December 21st 2012. Suddenly, terrible news! You are visited by a Fourth Dimensional Cube Being claiming that the world will now end in 2017! Now it's up to you, and your advisers, to find a way to prevent or survive this End Of The World before it's too late! 

Through monthly meetings with your advisers you will solve crises, manage minion armies in the world map and take steps to prevent the End Of The World, from your base on the moon.The best way that we found to describe Conspiracy Prophecy 2017 is to call it an ""automated single player board game"". Features and priorities include: 

Manage Four Resources: Resources, Thralls, Sheeple, Stability




Resources: May spend directly. The amount of fabric, steel, gold, electronics,etc... that you have at your disposal


Thralls: May spend directly. The number of people that are directly under control of your mind controlling microchips


Sheeple: Gain through choices. The amount of people that do not believe in you worldwide


Stability: Gain through choices. 








Every turn begins with an event being sent to you via your abPadSung30000. After having a chance to confer with each one of your advisers, you make a choice as to how to deal with the event. Generally speaking, each event has a probable outcome that can be negative or positive to your current situation. You will have multiple choices to spend some of your resources on trying to affect the result in one way or another as well as an option to let the event proceed as planned.  



Events, and your decisions on how to deal with them, also have effects on your relationship with your advisers. If you decide to ignore an alien spaceship crash-landing on Earth, your alien adviser will probably not be very happy. The worse an adviser feels about you the more it will cost to have his or her help when dealing with the End Of The World endgame. 





Once the event is resolved you are brought to the main world map where the world is divided into 11 different regions, here you can influence the various regions by hiring and deploying armies of minions from your Earth base of Atlantis. The minion armies come in three types:







Enforcer minions are soldiers and secret police. Their mission is to re-establish order in one of the world's regions and raise stability. In doing so, however, they also reduce the percentage of sheeple that region produces since the combat is bound to have unintended casualties.

CEO of bread company decides to stop embedding mind control chemicals in the bread? Why not replace him with a robot clone of himself? 


Crop circles evolved into talking wheat? Why not nuke them? 


Of course, you can always replace news of the event with cat videos. The Illuminati love replacing info with cat videos.

<p>Players begin with six sticks, chosen randomly using reload cards. The three types of sticks, purple, orange and red, are 3, 4 and 5 units long respectively and can be placed along the blue dots marked on the board. While all three sticks can be placed horizontally or vertically, red stick can also be placed diagonally.</p>

<p>Each player places two sticks in their turn, with each stick's tip touching the tip of at least one other stick on the board. If a geometric shape is created in the process, the player earns points.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Points are awarded as per three parameters :</p>
<ol>
<li>Perimeter of the shape </li>
<li>Bonus as per the type of the shape </li>
<li>Points in blue circles, if the shape surrounds any such circles on the board. </li>
</ol>

<p>Players can display their scores on the board using their scorelines. Three score markers are provided to each player, which can be placed on the relevant numbers to indicate their total score. The example below demonstrates how a score of 123 can be represented on a scoreline. The first player to reach a score of 500 wins the game.<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1168488/files/20150122231146-scoreline-123_03.jpg?1421997106"" src="""" style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""/></p>
<p>Once all six sticks are used, a player may collect six more by picking a reload card. </p>
<p>Additionally, five power cards are distributed to each player at the beginning of the game. These cards provide special powers to the players that can improve their position in the game or slow down the progress of other players. The cards may be used in any turn up to a maximum of two per turn.</p>

<p>1. As the game design, play testing and art work is mostly completed, the next major stage is manufacturing these games. While the size specifications of game material and print quality may vary to optimize the cost, we have mitigated these risks to an extent by planning the designs as per our discussions with a few manufacturers.<br/></p>
<p>2. We plan to partner with Kartrocket for an online store and shipping management service and are confident in their ability to successfully manage our international shipping requirements.</p>

THREE STICKS is a board game that takes geometry to the next level. Players are challenged to think creatively and use only three types of sticks to create geometric shapes. In each turn, players add two sticks to the board and earn points for the shapes created. With compelling game mechanics and exciting surprises, Three Sticks is a promising entertainer for both kids and adults.



















Playing Three Sticks is also a great way to rediscover geometry. While trying to figure out geometric shapes, players begin to realize how shapes are interconnected and how easily a big, complex shape can be broken into small, simpler shapes. All, in a naturally paced, playful manner. 
Three Sticks is a beautiful blend of academic concepts + experiential realization + creative thinking + fun and develops the core learning and innovation skills. 
We have tested the game with several kids and asked the experts what they thought about the game. Here's what they had to say:



Certainly not! We truly mean it when we say Three Sticks is suitable for ages 10+. While the game has been designed keeping better learning in mind, the game can be enjoyed by kids and adults, at school and at home. With its creative challenges and fun-filled power cards, Three Sticks is a complete family entertainer.

1. Four 9"" x 9"" plastic boards that can be attached using four green Lock Sticks to form an 18"" x 18"" main board with holes around each blue dot.





2. Three types of sticks (25 of each type) that can be placed along the blue dots on the board, with protrusions fitting into the holes.


                                    



3. Twelve Score Markers of four different colors that can be used by each player to display their scores on the board.


                  

4. Reload Cards that randomly award a set of six sticks to each player.






5. Power Cards that can enhance a player's chances to win.



6. Two Quick Reference Cards and a Rules Book with detailed illustrations.


                            
                                   

   

A FULL SET includes the following additional components:


1. Additional sticks (10 of each type) that can be placed along the blue dots on the board, with protrusions fitting into the holes.2. One Special Pythagoras Stand to hold the three piles of sticks.



3. Twelve FT 50 (First Time 50) cards that introduce a new scoring parameter.
  
4. Four 500+ Cards that can extend the game to a total score of 1000.

  
5. One 1-minute sand timer for a fast-paced variation of the game. 


6. Special Reference Cards that can help you to score more.



                                       


Players begin with six sticks, chosen randomly using reload cards. The three types of sticks, purple, orange and red, are 3, 4 and 5 units long respectively and can be placed along the blue dots marked on the board. While all three sticks can be placed horizontally or vertically, red stick can also be placed diagonally.



        
Each player places two sticks in their turn, with each stick's tip touching the tip of at least one other stick on the board. If a geometric shape is created in the process, the player earns points.

Points are awarded as per three parameters :

Perimeter of the shape 
Bonus as per the type of the shape 
Points in blue circles, if the shape surrounds any such circles on the board. 

EXAMPLE: 
          
Score for rectangle = Perimeter + Shape Bonus + Points on Board                                                                                      = (4+4+4+4+5+3) + 20 +20 = 24+ 20 +20                                                                                            = 64 points
Players can display their scores on the board using their scorelines. Three score markers are provided to each player, which can be placed on the relevant numbers to indicate their total score. The example below demonstrates how a score of 123 can be represented on a scoreline. The first player to reach a score of 500 wins the game.
Once all six sticks are used, a player may collect six more by picking a reload card. 
Additionally, five power cards are distributed to each player at the beginning of the game. These cards provide special powers to the players that can improve their position in the game or slow down the progress of other players. The cards may be used in any turn up to a maximum of two per turn.





Over the past ten months, Three Sticks has been playtested rigorously with school kids, young adults and even grand parents. The game went through several iterations and has evolved to its current form, where the practical limitations of movable sticks don't restrain the game's fun. Here's a sneak peek at Three Stick's evolution.





Kitki is an experiential education start-up in India that has taken up the challenge to elevate the perception of learning and to bring back the curiosity to learn in school children. In the last 1.5 years, we organised experiential learning workshops and life exposure programs with schools to stimulate active thinking among kids. 

Three Sticks is a part of our PlayingIsLearning project through which we aim to create such play-based learning products that transform learning into an enjoyable, exciting experience. Two more exciting games are in the pipeline: 
Operation Escape E.V.I.L: A game that turns chemistry into magic!


SAMRAT: A war-game where the players experience real Indian history!



OUR TEAM
Pramod Ponnaluri: Founder of Kitki and the brain behind the games.
Rohini Deepthi Natti: Co-Founder of Kitki and the lady with the digital brush.
Kavikrut: Mentor and the Harvard MBA with the entrepreneurial wisdom.
3D Printing Partner : THINK3D  




1. As the game design, play testing and art work is mostly completed, the next major stage is manufacturing these games. While the size specifications of game material and print quality may vary to optimize the cost, we have mitigated these risks to an extent by planning the designs as per our discussions with a few manufacturers.
2. We plan to partner with Kartrocket for an online store and shipping management service and are confident in their ability to successfully manage our international shipping requirements.
3. Timelines have been planned keeping in mind the discussions with our potential partners. However, there could be any unexpected delays in manufacturing and shipping processes. 






Contributing money is only one of the several ways you can be a part of this revolution. For the PlayingIsLearning project to truly succeed, we need to raise awareness about how learning is a fascinating experience and that forced learning may do more harm than good. Let's learn for the right reason. Let's learn because learning is so exciting!

Be our ambassador, let your friends know about us. Connect us with parents, teachers and schools. Introduce us to board game lovers, reviewers and media. Together, we can change the way learning is perceived.

<p>The dreamlike atmosphere featured in the game was inspired by the works of a Polish painter, Zdzislaw Beksinski, and a recently deceased Swiss painter, H.R.Giger, among others. The game's final appearance was also greatly influenced by the worlds presented in such games as Demon's Souls and Dark Seed. From this mixture we created a world full of darkness and depression.<br/>

It is an idea which we've already successfully executed in our previous, smaller product. Now we've just made it better.

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Platforms and technology</h3>
Tormentum is being developed with the use of Adobe AIR Technology. Our plans include a version for PC, Mac, Linux and mobile versions for iOS and Android.<br/>
<br/>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/616851/files/20140531135224-systemy.jpg?1401569544"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<p></p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Why IndieGoGo?</h3>
<p>Previously, for many years we've been working in different companies. Our first own product was a humble children's interactive book made for tablets, called Amelia and Terror of the Night.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASeKyb_XSRI"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/611967/files/20140529082750-Grafika_na_indie_czesc_2_12.jpg?1401377270"" src="""" style=""""/></a></p>
Finishing this app mobilized us to start a more ambitious project and this is how we came up with the idea of creating a simple and short adventure game. Contrary to what we've been initially anticipating, after eight months of work it turned out that the game in the making isn't really going to be simple, nor short. Our project has gotten out of control and started living on its own. Since that time another 8 months went by and this is how we've reached this place, that is...
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/612361/files/20140529111607-Grafika_na_indie_czesc_2_15.jpg?1401387367"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/>
<p></p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Why do we need your help?</h3>
<p>Above all things, we dream of finishing this game in the exact form on which we previously decided.</p>
<p>However, to accomplish that we need more time and more time means more money. The amount of time we can devote to Tormentum is running short. At present, more often than ever, we need to take various additional casual jobs.</p>
<p>Additional money would buy us some time, which would allow us to shut ourselves in our home offices and fully concentrate on making the game. <br/>
</p>
<p>We're estimating that we still need about 20 more weeks of constant work of our three-man team before the game is finished.</p>
<p>To sum up, we're gathering funds in order to be able to pay the bills, buy food, etc. It'll allow us to fully concentrate on finishing Tormentum.<br/>
</p>
<p>Apart from that, we would also like to professionally translate our game to English because, for now, the game is being created solely in Polish.</p>
<p><br/>
</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">OhNoo Studio Team</h3>
Previously for many years we've been creating games, but not under our own name and not necessarily the way that we wanted. However, thanks to that we've gained some experience and, above all, we became tight friends, which is very important. Our first own product, a children's interactive book called Amelia and Terror of the Night, was published in 2013. It only whetted our appetites and so we came to a conclusion, that we need to publish our own game. And this is how we've found ourselves in the current place.<br/><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/616939/files/20140531145859-Grafika_na_indie_czesc_2_16.png?1401573539"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Stretch goals</h3>
<p>Our dream is to dub the whole game but, unfortunately, this isn't very cheap.</p>
We would also like to translate Tormentum into more languages besides English; this way we would be able to interest more people in our game. But for that we also need more money.<br/>
<p></p>
<p></p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/747373/files/20140727152730-tormentum_stretch_goal.png?1406500050"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p></p><p></p><p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Risk and Challenges</h3>
<br/>
<p>Our campaign on IndieGoGo is both a big challenge and a great opportunity to us. This way we hope to raise the funds needed to finish the game faster and better than currently possible. We do all sorts of odd jobs in order to finance Tormentum, but by doing so we're losing much time as well as concentration which we would much rather invest in the game.</p>
<br/>
<p>The risk is very little because as of today the majority of our materials is ready. We also have two big playable chapters completed. Now we just need a little bit more time to refine the details and finish the game.</p>
<br/>
<p>OhNoo Studio may be a very small team, but our ambitions are great. Reaching our goal will let us fully concentrate on our work for at least the next 2 months. You won't be disappointed.</p>

<h4>How many languages will Tormentum support?</h4>
Polish and English, at least for now. The English version still needs professional editing which is one of the reasons for our campaign. Availability of other language versions will depend on the amount of help received.
<p></p>
<p><br/>
</p>
<h4>Will Tormentum be DRM free?</h4>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p><br/>
</p>
<h4>How long is the game going to be?</h4>
<p>At present, it is a little bit difficult to say, but depending on a player's experience with this kind of games, we estimate that it will be possible to finish it in about 4 to 6 hours.</p>
<p><br/>
</p>
<h4>Is Tormentum going to be one of those HOPA (Hidden Object Puzzle Adventure) games?</h4>
<p>Puzzle and Adventure - YES, but Hidden Object - NO. We aren't big fans of this type of games. :) Generally speaking, expect a gameplay based on using objects on other objects as well as logical mini-games. The game is also going to feature environment exploration, different characters to meet, as well as moral choices.</p>
<p><br/>
</p>
<h4>Is Tormentum going to feature complex interactive dialogue options during conversations with other characters?</h4>
<p>We'll be able to listen to whatever those characters want to tell us, but we won't be able to ask them questions. It is possible to skip the dialogues in case the player just wants to focus on the puzzle side of the game and not the story.</p>
<p><br/>
</p>
<h4>Will I be able to move the character freely?</h4>
<p>The interface was invented in such a way as to not unnecessarily frustrate the player. After playing many adventure games we came to a conclusion that waiting for the character to move from one place to another can be very boring and discouraging. Because of that, in our game the character stands always in the same place. The player, however, is able to explore an area with his cursor (or fingers, in case of tablets), by moving the camera.</p>
<p><br/>
</p>
<h4>Should we be afraid of the so-called “pixel-hunt”, so often found in adventure games?</h4>
<p>We've applied a non-invasive tip system to the game. Additionally, it is going to be possible to zoom into every pickable item in the game, letting the player to watch it closely, even before picking it up.</p>
<p><br/>
</p>
<h4>How many endings there are going to be?</h4>
<p>There are going to be two endings, good and bad, both dependent on the choices made during the game.</p>
<p><br/>
</p>
<h4>How big the game world is going to be?</h4>
<p>We plan on making three big lands open for exploration. Access to the next land is gained after completing the current one.</p>
<p><br/>
</p>
<h4>Is the game going to be brutal? Will there be blood?</h4>
<p>The game is intended for adult players.</p>
<p><br/>
</p>
<h4>When will I receive my rewards?</h4>
<p>All rewards will be dispatched as soon as we finish working on the game. To us, it is a matter of honour.</p>
<p><br/>
</p>
<h4>On what platforms do you plan to release Tormentum, and when?</h4>
<p>PC, Mac, iOS, and Android! The dates depend on whether we'll be able to raise the necessary funds.</p>
<p><br/>
</p>
<h4>How much should I add for shipping?</h4>
<p>Shipping is free for all locations.</p>
<p><br/>
</p>
<h4>What t-shirt sizes will be available?</h4>

</a></div>","Go to the Steam Shop >>>>Tormentum is a 2D adventure game developed by the independent 3-person OhNoo studio. Immerse yourself in a world from the border of dream and nightmare

Tormentum was Greenlit!  Thank you for support us! Keep in mind, everyone who buys the game through our Indiegogo fundraiser for 9$ will get a key Steam when the game releases!You can download our demo Here:

Selected quotes from the press:
“But beyond the story this game is full to the brim of incredible art work, probably the most amazing looking details I've yet seen on Indiegogo for an Adventure game.” - Inide Retro News“And really, Tormentum actually looks like something with a lot of potential, with a decent chunk of gameplay and design ideas already showcased.” - Gameora""The three-man team has previously developed a small, storybook title called Amelia and Terror of the Night, so this is something of a big step forward for them."" - Bit Pulse“Polish OhNoo Studio’s newest game, Tormentum, is a point-and-click adventure with art you’d mistake for van Gogh’s in a museum.” - Indiegamemag



The dreamlike atmosphere featured in the game was inspired by the works of a Polish painter, Zdzislaw Beksinski, and a recently deceased Swiss painter, H.R.Giger, among others. The game's final appearance was also greatly influenced by the worlds presented in such games as Demon's Souls and Dark Seed. From this mixture we created a world full of darkness and depression.



Unfortunately, bigger problems seem to arise. The flying ship lands in a big castle and the main hero is soon imprisoned in it. This is how this surreal story from the border of dream and reality begins...


Traversing different areas the hero learns the dark world in which he was imprisoned. Visiting new lands, he slowly starts to uncover the truth about himself.









CONTENT


Dark adventure from the border of dream and reality


Outstanding soundtrack with more than 20 tracks








Unique, hand-drawn illustrations



3 lands, differing in terms of architecture, weather, and creatures dwelling in them










Moral choices which will have an impact on the game's end



Characters with unique personalities, which will help or try to prevent the hero in reaching his goal


A variety of riddles integrated into the game in a form of different locks, traps, gates, etc.


Incredible atmosphere








Like in every other adventure game, our hero will be equipped with a bag in which he'll be able to store items found throughout the game.



The game is going to include many additional logical riddles, apart from the ones found in the standard adventure. By that we mean different locks to open, unusual mechanisms, and puzzles to solve.






While on a given screen, we do not control the hero's steps, but the camera that watches him. Moving the cursor in a given direction will move the plans by a certain distance. Thanks to that solution, a player can experience a 3d effect achieved from applying 2d illustrations. In some of the instances the number of such illustrations will amount to 20!
It is an idea which we've already successfully executed in our previous, smaller product. Now we've just made it better.




Platforms and technology
Tormentum is being developed with the use of Adobe AIR Technology. Our plans include a version for PC, Mac, Linux and mobile versions for iOS and Android.





Why IndieGoGo?
Previously, for many years we've been working in different companies. Our first own product was a humble children's interactive book made for tablets, called Amelia and Terror of the Night.



Finishing this app mobilized us to start a more ambitious project and this is how we came up with the idea of creating a simple and short adventure game. Contrary to what we've been initially anticipating, after eight months of work it turned out that the game in the making isn't really going to be simple, nor short. Our project has gotten out of control and started living on its own. Since that time another 8 months went by and this is how we've reached this place, that is...






Why do we need your help?
Above all things, we dream of finishing this game in the exact form on which we previously decided.
However, to accomplish that we need more time and more time means more money. The amount of time we can devote to Tormentum is running short. At present, more often than ever, we need to take various additional casual jobs.
Additional money would buy us some time, which would allow us to shut ourselves in our home offices and fully concentrate on making the game. 

We're estimating that we still need about 20 more weeks of constant work of our three-man team before the game is finished.
To sum up, we're gathering funds in order to be able to pay the bills, buy food, etc. It'll allow us to fully concentrate on finishing Tormentum.

Apart from that, we would also like to professionally translate our game to English because, for now, the game is being created solely in Polish.




OhNoo Studio Team
Previously for many years we've been creating games, but not under our own name and not necessarily the way that we wanted. However, thanks to that we've gained some experience and, above all, we became tight friends, which is very important. Our first own product, a children's interactive book called Amelia and Terror of the Night, was published in 2013. It only whetted our appetites and so we came to a conclusion, that we need to publish our own game. And this is how we've found ourselves in the current place.


Stretch goals
Our dream is to dub the whole game but, unfortunately, this isn't very cheap.
We would also like to translate Tormentum into more languages besides English; this way we would be able to interest more people in our game. But for that we also need more money.





Risk and Challenges

Our campaign on IndieGoGo is both a big challenge and a great opportunity to us. This way we hope to raise the funds needed to finish the game faster and better than currently possible. We do all sorts of odd jobs in order to finance Tormentum, but by doing so we're losing much time as well as concentration which we would much rather invest in the game.

The risk is very little because as of today the majority of our materials is ready. We also have two big playable chapters completed. Now we just need a little bit more time to refine the details and finish the game.

OhNoo Studio may be a very small team, but our ambitions are great. Reaching our goal will let us fully concentrate on our work for at least the next 2 months. You won't be disappointed.

<p>Reza's interest in Martial Arts was
apparent at a very young age. As a teenager he started training Hapkido and
through years of intense training he achieved 3rd DAN (3rd Degree Black Belt).
He's a pioneer and founder of Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, Capoeira and MMA in Bahrain.</p>
<p>In 1995, during a training session
he suffered a serious injury to his spinal cord, which immobilized him and put
his dreams to a halt. He focused on his recovery, and having regained mobility,
still unable to train, decided to travel to San Diego, California, to pursue
his studies in Graphic Design. </p>
<p>There, Reza's interest caught a
martial art he hasn't encountered before – Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu. He was inspired
by Royce Gracie, a BJJ practitioner who competed in the Ultimate Fighting
Championship. By then miraculously reaching full recovery, he was able to train
again. </p>
<p>This was the start of the greatest
passion of his career as a martial artist. He broadened his jiu-jitsu training
with wrestling and judo classes and trained under Roy Harris, American black
belt under Joe Morera. Reza was able to compete a lot during this period
achieving a lot of medals in the process. </p>
<p>In the late 1999, after getting his
associate degree , he came back to Bahrain to work . </p>
<p>Back then nobody has heard of the
art of Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu in the Kingdom, so he started teaching his family
members and some close friends. Reza's first student was his brother Seena.
Today there is almost 200 students in multiple arts.</p>
<p>In 2002 he received a letter from
General Organization of Youth and Sports (GOYS), granting him permission to
open a jiu-jitsu academy. The idea of opening a place teaching multiple martial
arts started forming. That is how he began learning Muay Thai, travelling to
Thailand, home of the art, few times a year, for months at the time. Then
Reza's Martial Arts Centre was created. </p><p>Later On Reza became fully time dedicated to RMAC.</p>
<p><b><u>Classes offered</u></b></p>
<p>The Center offers classes in

</h3> <p></p>
<p>ATC is a game in which players take role of Air Traffic Controllers
on an airport. The main objective of the game is to make sure that all the
planes land or take off without any problems. We want to release the game in
two versions: for PC and as a board game. The PC version will have more game
modes, that is both card based game as well as turn base, single player mode.</p>
<p>The board game will be available to play from 4 to 6
players. Each player will control one airport with its ATC (Air Traffic
Controllers) and try to take off and land as many planes as possible. That will
provide victory points in order to win the game. </p>
<p></p> </div> <div> <h3>Game mechanics</h3>
<p>
</p>
<p>In our game players take turns that are split into several phases, where they can play different cards, until one of them is declared a winner. All
airports, planes and ATC are represented by cards. The planes are never
controlled by a single player. Instead they are moved from one airport to
another during the game and their number constantly increaes. The ATC
cards are used to send planes from and into the air. The main idea of the game
is to show how difficult and stressful is the job of Air Traffic Controllers.
As both board games and aviation fans, we tried to balance the rules so they
are easy to understand for people who never even heard of ATC before. At the
same time, players familiar with aviation will see that by the vocabulary and
mechanics used in the game we tried to make it as realistic as it can be without
making it too complex. The PC version will contain both card game and single player
modes. However, we will only finish it if we rise at least 3000 USD. <br/></p>
<p><b>A short decription of the rules:</b><br/>ATC: Rush Hours is a game 
about managing an airport. It is focused on the work of Air Traffic 
Controllers (ATC). Here is a picture of an airport board that we

<p>Game Aero is an indie game development company. We take part in every aspect of game building, from art and animation to game design and production. Here at Game Aero, we are passionate about making games that are new, original, and exciting. That's why we came up with our newest project: The Ultimate Game. We believe that the best way to get a game that everyone loves is to get everyone involved!<br/><br/><strong>How it works: <br/></strong><br/>As you donate to our cause, you gain insider access codes to specific parts of the game building process, along with the standard rewards. By going to our website <a href=""http://www.gameaero.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.gameaero.com</a> you can use those codes to participate in building the game! You have the option to contribute to the game in the form of art and level design or even specific characters. Don't know how to do any of that stuff? Don't worry! Behind each reward is our team of programmers and artists to help get your concepts in the game. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What we need from you:</strong></p>
<p>In order for this idea to work, we <em>need</em> your participation above everything else. Feel free to contribute any way that you can, whether in the free polls on our website, or as a paying supporter. However, where the money is concerned, any and all funds will go towards paying our artists and developers to make the game. We are looking to get 500 dollars from this campaign. If we do, we feel that we can make the game using that and a mix of funding from other sources. And of course, we would love to have you donate so that we can reward you for your support!</p>
<p><b>Stretch Goals:</b></p>
<p>Below are some of the things we will do if we go over our expected fundraising amount:</p>
<p>$500: This is our lowest goal. We want this much in order to proceed. The game will be released on every major mobile platform as well as in an online format.</p>
<p>$1000: If we reach this goal, the game will be released free of charge. There will be no ads or tricky in-app purchasing.</p>
<p>$2000:This amount would guarantee that we run a similar project, The Ultimate Game 2, with even more involvement.</p>
<p><b>Timeline:</b></p>
<p>This is what the timeline for this project is looking like thus far:</p>
<p>Sept.15th, 2013- Project Launch</p>
<p>Oct. 15th, 2013- End of Fundraising</p>

<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Game Play Description<br/></strong></p>
<p>AfterTime: Survival is a post apocalyptic board game that leads gamers on the journey with Kai, making decisions that could impact the survival of the human race. The board has a simple roll and move mechanic but when the players land on a ""running Kai"" space they draw a ""Survival"" card. Players compete as they race to amass resource points to build their own houses; but then the game takes a turn when they have to cooperate and negotiate with each other to spend and/or pool their community points to build community houses. The winner of the game is the person who has been helpful enough to get all of the community houses built but has also balanced their own needs and has completed building their own five individual houses. It is monopoly turned inside-out.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<p>Our goal is<strong> to raise $1500</strong> in order to fund the production of the games required for beta <strong>testing among 25 gaming groups</strong> across the country. Anyone can donate to this effort, but we are specifically looking for<strong> educators (home school, junior high and high school), mental health professionals, parents of 14-18 year olds, and gamers</strong> (even if you do not have kids) to become beta testers. So far, <em>After Time: Survival</em> been used successfully with students in a high school wellness class in Illinois, but we need more voices. Your thoughts will help us make the dream of bringing edge-of-your-seat games to the educational community come true.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>We will hold a random drawing of 25 people from the pool of IndieGoGo contributors to become our beta testers. <strong>If you give at least $75 you are guaranteed a spot</strong> as a tester. All of the other names will be entered into a drawing for a chance to win the remaining games.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><em><strong>If you do not want to be a beta-tester but want to support us we will find an educator or therapist or parent that can test the game. In short you will be sponsoring a tester.</strong></em></p>

<p><strong><em>If you want to test but have no money to give to the campaign please post a comment to that effect (check the private box so that only we can see it) so that we can make a list of interested testers.</em></strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Perks:</strong></p>
<p><br/><strong>$75</strong> = you will be guaranteed to be a beta tester and receive a copy of the game, access to the Child and Adolescent Wellness Scale (CAWS), the satisfaction that you are helping to create a better world, and you will have our undying gratitude.</p>

<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<p><em>AfterTime: Survival</em>  is a game being developed as an elaborative learning tool for the Child and Wellness Adolescent Scale (CAWS). Rooted in resilience research of positive psychology, the CAWS is a self-report instrument that provides psychologists a tool for evaluating the well-being competencies of children and adolescents. The game provides educators an engaging means for teaching wellness skills across ten domains that increase social competency. The CAWS and the <em>AfterTime</em> game allow psychologists and educators to collaborate in the teaching of pro-social behavior.</p>

<p><img alt=""Render"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://img442.imageshack.us/img442/487/titanic09112.png"" src="""" style="""" title=""Titanic sailing at night""/><br/><em>Race against the odds to clear your name aboard a ship sailing into history.</em></p>
<p>""Titanic: Honor and Glory"" will be an adventure game set on board a fully explorable and faithfully recreated 3D model of the doomed liner RMS Titanic. The player will experience the voyage first hand while trying to clear his name of a wrongful accusation.</p>
<p>Utilizing the most cutting edge features of Crytek's CryENGINE 3, you'll experience one of the most dramatic moments in history.</p>
<p>The player will be able to explore the entire ship, from the top of the fourth funnel to the popeller shaft tunnels below, and every deck and room in between including all first, second, and third class public rooms, corridors, and cabins, and all crew areas and major engineering spaces. Two modes of play will be included in the game-</p>
<h2><strong>Story Mode: </strong></h2>
<p>The player will interract with historical figures to try to solve the mystery. The player will visit every class and be forced to interract with even the most exotic areas of the ship. Story Mode climaxes with an accurate and real-time sinking of the ship.</p>
<p><img alt=""Render"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://img442.imageshack.us/img442/4153/899845645.png"" src="""" style="""" title=""Titanic sinking""/><br/><em>Dodge danger and death to save yourself and others as the ship sinks under your feet.</em></p>
<p>The year is 1912. While on a train from London to Southampton, Owen ""Robert"" Morgan is arrested by Scotland Yard detectives for robbing the British Museum. Only thing is- Robert isn't guilty. Knowing the real villain will be fleeing England on the Titanic, the player breaks free and stows aboard the ship to hunt him down, bring him to justice, and clear his own name. Hot on his trail, with allies and enemies all over the vessel, Robert Morgan finds himself at the center of one of history's most tragic disasters.</p>
<h2><strong>Explorer Mode:</strong></h2>
<p>With no time limits, a place to be, or a care in world, explore the ship as you'd like.</p>
<p>Wander the levels of the Grand Staircase, walk through the galleys, take a peek at the engines, wind your way through Scotland Road, mosey on over to the bridge, and explore any class and any room you'd like without the worry of a crewman catching you. Every cabin, corridor, closet, and bathroom will be accessible. In explorer mode, you may even have the option to learn more about the ship in the process through interactive guides, reading material and other interactive tidbits throughout the ship.</p>

<p>The simple answer is that we simply cannot fund the entire project ourselves, and without the necessary funding we cannot go much further.</p>
<p>Essentially the entire current team is working on an unpaid, volunteer basis. We do so because we're passionate about the Titanic, everything about it, and are keen to finish this project and bring people a wonderful game and the opportunity to see the Titanic in all her glory. However, we can only go so far with what we have now in terms of hardware, software, team members, and unpaid time devoted to working on the project.</p>
<h2>What the money will be used for:</h2>
<p>A large portion of the money we earn here on Indiegogo, if we only reach our primary goal, will go towards purchasing computer hardware and software. All of our current equipment is quite out of date, and either on the verge of failure, or already obsolete. For the past two years we've been working on modeling and designing the ship and game, but it moves at a greuling pace due to our limited equipment. Upgrading what we have will drastically improve our work efficiency. We will also be purchasing better programs to build the 3D models and sound libraries to develop the soundtrack.</p>
<p>Another key part of the budget goes to resources. We need to buy higher quality plans of the ship and high resolution photographs to inform us about every nook and cranny of the vessel, as well as books to get a better picture of the ship's history.</p>
<h3><strong>Phase 2?</strong></h3>
<p>Phase 2 incolves the modeling and CryEngine conversions. It is also the finalization stage for the story, the cinematics, and other critical parts of the game. Phase 2 is also the most expensive stage, as all the equipment needed for this phase will be used for later phases, too. Phase 3 is mainly sounds, voice acting, and programming and game-scripting to make it an interactive story. Phase 4 is testing, and Phase 5 is distribution, hopefully via a third party distributer.</p>
<h3>What else will any money be used for?</h3>
<p>If we are funded enough to work across all project phases, here are a few things we're looking at that will incur expenses that are currently out of our hands, including what's needed for Pahse 2:</p>
<ul>
<li>Newer and better computers and compueter hardware. for high-poly 3D modeling and work in CryENGINE 3.</li>
<li>Accessories such as drawing tablets for creating artwork and textures.</li>
<li>New software for 3D modeling, rendering and otehr tasks.</li>
<li>Software and equipment for sound recording and processing, as well as music composition.</li>
<li>Software and equipment, or commisioning of a third party, for motion capture animation.</li>
<li>The hiring/commissioning of voice actors, artists, programmers, and others to work on various aspects of the game.</li>
<li>Possible coverage for some lost wages so that our interior modeler, and possibly other members of the team, can devote more time to work on the game, thus speeding the project up a bit.</li>
<li>Reference material such as plans and photographs for Titanic and other ships and game elements, and books.</li>
<li>Legal, licensing, outreach/advertising, and other expenses to cover miscellaneous aspects of the project.</li>
<li>...And much more that cannot be listed here.</li>
</ul>
<p>All funds, no matter how much, will go toward improving and working on the game.</p>
<h3><strong>Release date?</strong></h3>
<p>We do not, as of yet, have a specific date for completion. We have been working on this project as volunteers, and as such are not able to devote as much time as we'd like to the game. But rest assured, we're working as hard as we can, as much as we can, to accomplish what needs to be done, and with your help we will be able to reach our goals, devote more time and resources, and bring more people on board to get things done.</p>
<h2>Stretch Goals.</h2>
<p>Phase 2 can be covered with $20,000 and may take approximately a year to accomplish. But, there are ways we can speed up work in this phase, or even the full game if more funds are raised.</p>
<p>___________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://img109.imageshack.us/img109/6270/imageopfa.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Nomadic""/></p>
<p><em><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><strong>Nomadic Level</strong></span><br/></em>For <strong>$20,000</strong>, we can fund Phase 2 of the video game. We'll be able to scrape by on what we need and get the equipment required. However, when it comes time, we will have to fund Phase 3 in about a year.</p>
<p>___________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://img825.imageshack.us/img825/1007/imageqrm.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Carpathia""/></p>
<p><em><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><strong>Carpathia Level</strong></span><br/></em>For <strong>$40,000</strong>, we can comfortably fund Phase 2 and devote more time and effort towards it. We could also probably cut the time in half for devloping the phase. Again, though, we would have to raise funds again when the time comes for Phase 3.</p>
<p>___________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://img59.imageshack.us/img59/9362/imagewbf.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Lusitania""/></p>
<p><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><em>Lusitania Level</em></span></strong><em><br/></em>For <strong>$60,000</strong>, we can fund the entire game- all phases at once without having to run another funding campaign. However, it would take some time to get through, and we won't be able to devote as much effort towards it as we'd like, but it would give us the required budget.</p>
<p>___________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://img5.imageshack.us/img5/3045/imageezg.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Titanic""/></p>
<p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><strong><em>Titanic Level</em></strong></span><em><br/></em>For <strong>$80,000</strong>, we'll be able to comfortably cover all expenses required and give this game our full time and energy! $80,000 would allow us to purchase all equipment required to produce an efficient and stunning game.</p>

<h2>Donations:</h2>
<p><span style=""font-size: 10px;"">Even just a little donation will help get what we need for this game. Some of our needed custom built computers cost anywhere from $1,000 to $3,000, but even just a few dollars can help us cover the expenses needed to commission minor art works or reference materials. And of course, small donations add up, too. But, if you are able to give more, please give all you can!</span></p>
<h2>About our perks:</h2>
<p><strong>Anyone who donates not only receives the perk level they donate at, but also all the ones smaller than that.</strong> That means, someone who donates $100 will receive the $100 reward, the $50 reward, the $25 reward, and the $1 reward. Someone who donates $10,000 will receive all, but someone who donates $1 will only receive the $1 reward.</p>
<p>Donating multiple times will also elevate you in perk levels. That is, if you donate $100 twice, you'll get the $200 perk, plus the perk levels below that.</p>

</div></div>","Race against the odds to clear your name aboard a ship sailing into history.
""Titanic: Honor and Glory"" will be an adventure game set on board a fully explorable and faithfully recreated 3D model of the doomed liner RMS Titanic. The player will experience the voyage first hand while trying to clear his name of a wrongful accusation.
Utilizing the most cutting edge features of Crytek's CryENGINE 3, you'll experience one of the most dramatic moments in history.
The player will be able to explore the entire ship, from the top of the fourth funnel to the popeller shaft tunnels below, and every deck and room in between including all first, second, and third class public rooms, corridors, and cabins, and all crew areas and major engineering spaces. Two modes of play will be included in the game-
Story Mode: 
The player will interract with historical figures to try to solve the mystery. The player will visit every class and be forced to interract with even the most exotic areas of the ship. Story Mode climaxes with an accurate and real-time sinking of the ship.
Dodge danger and death to save yourself and others as the ship sinks under your feet.
The year is 1912. While on a train from London to Southampton, Owen ""Robert"" Morgan is arrested by Scotland Yard detectives for robbing the British Museum. Only thing is- Robert isn't guilty. Knowing the real villain will be fleeing England on the Titanic, the player breaks free and stows aboard the ship to hunt him down, bring him to justice, and clear his own name. Hot on his trail, with allies and enemies all over the vessel, Robert Morgan finds himself at the center of one of history's most tragic disasters.
Explorer Mode:
With no time limits, a place to be, or a care in world, explore the ship as you'd like.
Wander the levels of the Grand Staircase, walk through the galleys, take a peek at the engines, wind your way through Scotland Road, mosey on over to the bridge, and explore any class and any room you'd like without the worry of a crewman catching you. Every cabin, corridor, closet, and bathroom will be accessible. In explorer mode, you may even have the option to learn more about the ship in the process through interactive guides, reading material and other interactive tidbits throughout the ship.
Sample work-in-progress play:
Click here for our latest video featuring an actual in-game tour of the entire Grand Staircase from Boat to F Deck and including the Reception Room and Pool. The models are still being worked on in-game, but this video gives a good picture of the way we'd like to allow players to explore the ship.

Explore all these areas and more to your heart's content.
F.A.Q.
Please click here for our Frequently Asked Questions page for additional information about various aspects of the project.





Our team, self titled ""Four Funnels Entertainment"" is a small group of Titanic designers and developers.
CORE TEAM:
Tom Lynskey, The Project Mananger, Director, Story Developer/Writer, Jedi: Tom is a film maker and Titanic historian. He is best known for his film ""The Last Signals"" about the Titanic's two telegraph operators, Harold Bride and John Phillips. He mainly makes films about history and develops them into an exciting story line, still faithful to the truth.
Matt DeWinkeleer, Interior Modeler, Historian: Matt is a professional 3D modeler and designer, as well as an experienced Titanic historian. For the past couple years he has been modeling a faithful reconstruction of the interior of the Titanic for the game utilizing as many resources as possible to deliver the most authentic model as possible.
Kyle Hudak, Exterior Modeler: Kyle, too, is a professional 3D modeler who is focusing on the exterior of the ship and other techinical areas of her, such as the boiler rooms and mechanics of the ship. Kyle, too, is using as many resources as are available. In the past, he has built a Virtual Sailor Titanic model, and contributed mainly to a Mafia Titanic Mod.
Derek Verveer, CryEngine Specialist, Developer: Derek is the CryEngine 3 converter and manager. When the models are completed, he inserts them into the game engine, and with the teams help, he adjusts the right lightng and ambient settings. He is also the tech specialist. Of the team, he knows best what equipment is needed for what purposes.
Sean Hewitt, Sound Manager: Sean specializes in directing and recording the sounds aspects of the game. He records sounds for it in all different places and is able to manipulate what he records into an accurate and dramatic piece of audio. As the game progresses, he will also manage the voice recordings.
CONSULTANTS/ADVISORS:
Ken Marschall, Visual and Technical Consultant: Ken is a renowned artist who has painted many wonderful images depicting the Titanic, be it sailing, sinking, or otherwise, paintings seen in a vast number of books, documentaries and other media. His paintings of Titanic have been an inspiration to many, including our own team, and have been instrumental in bringing Titanic and her story to life for anybody who has seen them. Ken was also a consultant for James Cameron's 'Titanic' (1997), as well as many other Titanic projects, and a visual effects artist for a number of feature films, among many other accomplishments.
Steve Hall, Technical Advisor: Steve is a renowned Titanic/Olympic Class historian and author of a number of books about these ships, including 'Titanic In Photographs' and the two volumes of 'Titanic: The Ship Magnificent'. Steve is also currently a consultant with the Blue Star Line for Professor Clive Palmer's Titanic II project.
Parks Stephenson, Technical and Historical Consultant: Parks is a retired naval officer, Titanic historian, and documentarian, having worked on and appearing in documentaries including National Geographic's 'Titanic: The Final Word with James Cameron' and History Channel's 'Titanic at 100: Mystery Solved', among others on the Titanic and other subjects. More recently he has done work regarding various areas of Titanic for James Cameron's upcoming book 'Exploring the Deep' (Release date: June 2013).
CONTRIBUTORS:
Nicolas Murgia, Period Texture Artist: Nicolas is our go-to guy for creating elegant and accurate textures for use on our game models. He uses GIMP to carefully create period designs from various refertence materials, matching them to the real thing as closely as possible and adding further depth to ther accuracy and detail of our models.
In addition to 15 other team members and contributors to our efforts to create this game, we're working to bring the best possible Titanic game we can!
To learn a little more about the core team members, click here.

Why we need your help:
The simple answer is that we simply cannot fund the entire project ourselves, and without the necessary funding we cannot go much further.
Essentially the entire current team is working on an unpaid, volunteer basis. We do so because we're passionate about the Titanic, everything about it, and are keen to finish this project and bring people a wonderful game and the opportunity to see the Titanic in all her glory. However, we can only go so far with what we have now in terms of hardware, software, team members, and unpaid time devoted to working on the project.
What the money will be used for:
A large portion of the money we earn here on Indiegogo, if we only reach our primary goal, will go towards purchasing computer hardware and software. All of our current equipment is quite out of date, and either on the verge of failure, or already obsolete. For the past two years we've been working on modeling and designing the ship and game, but it moves at a greuling pace due to our limited equipment. Upgrading what we have will drastically improve our work efficiency. We will also be purchasing better programs to build the 3D models and sound libraries to develop the soundtrack.
Another key part of the budget goes to resources. We need to buy higher quality plans of the ship and high resolution photographs to inform us about every nook and cranny of the vessel, as well as books to get a better picture of the ship's history.
Phase 2?
Phase 2 incolves the modeling and CryEngine conversions. It is also the finalization stage for the story, the cinematics, and other critical parts of the game. Phase 2 is also the most expensive stage, as all the equipment needed for this phase will be used for later phases, too. Phase 3 is mainly sounds, voice acting, and programming and game-scripting to make it an interactive story. Phase 4 is testing, and Phase 5 is distribution, hopefully via a third party distributer.
What else will any money be used for?
If we are funded enough to work across all project phases, here are a few things we're looking at that will incur expenses that are currently out of our hands, including what's needed for Pahse 2:

Newer and better computers and compueter hardware. for high-poly 3D modeling and work in CryENGINE 3.
Accessories such as drawing tablets for creating artwork and textures.
New software for 3D modeling, rendering and otehr tasks.
Software and equipment for sound recording and processing, as well as music composition.
Software and equipment, or commisioning of a third party, for motion capture animation.
The hiring/commissioning of voice actors, artists, programmers, and others to work on various aspects of the game.
Possible coverage for some lost wages so that our interior modeler, and possibly other members of the team, can devote more time to work on the game, thus speeding the project up a bit.
Reference material such as plans and photographs for Titanic and other ships and game elements, and books.
Legal, licensing, outreach/advertising, and other expenses to cover miscellaneous aspects of the project.
...And much more that cannot be listed here.

All funds, no matter how much, will go toward improving and working on the game.
Release date?
We do not, as of yet, have a specific date for completion. We have been working on this project as volunteers, and as such are not able to devote as much time as we'd like to the game. But rest assured, we're working as hard as we can, as much as we can, to accomplish what needs to be done, and with your help we will be able to reach our goals, devote more time and resources, and bring more people on board to get things done.

In an immeasurable imrpovement over previous Titanic games, you'll be able to explore one of the most accurate and complete recreations of the Titanic to date in a fully 3D and stunningly detailed environment.

</h3>
<p>My name is Trevor, I've been working as a graphic designer for a few years. I've done work designing cards for board and collectible card games, and I've started becoming more interested in tabletop games.</p>
<p>I found myself wanting simple, abstract, very modular, and setting-agnostic 3D terrain. Something that can be built quickly, stored easily, and would look and feel cool on the tabletop.</p>
<p>I've known about <a href=""http://www.dwarvenforge.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Dwarven Forge"">Dwarven Forge</a> for a long time and thought it was great, but it's very expensive and sort of specialized. <a href=""http://www.hasbro.com/games/kid-games/heroscape/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Heroscape"">Heroscape </a>(now out of print) is also neat, but not really the right size to use for typical RPGs and wargames, which are measured in inches, and many players do not like hexes.</p>
<p>But I thought, what if you just had cubes that linked together horizontally and stacked vertically? Have a handful of ""natural"" colors that you could intepret as a wide variety of materials. Make them one inch so they work with a lot of gaming systems. Plastic so they're durable, lightweight, and cheap.</p>
<p>I'm probably inspired a lot by both <a href=""http://www.minecraft.net"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Minecraft"">Minecraft </a>and LEGO, although the idea isn't really a Minecraft toy nor a general building brick.

<p>This project is not to raise money for the first edition, it is <i>not to collect pre-orders</i>. The goal here is to generate as much buzz as possible, and gather donations for the most expensive part of the manufacturing process, machining the mold.</p>
<p>The more donations are put toward the mold, the cheaper the final product will be and the fewer pre-orders I will require before going to production. The more people that know about the project, the more likely it will be accepted to Kickstarter and become a real product.</p>
<p>I want to be clear here, <b>you are not going to receive a box of Terrablox if you donate</b>. I cannot offer a set of actual Terrablox as a reward, because I cannot guarantee they will actually be produced.</p>
<p>So for rewards I am offering 3D printed samples and collector's items, such as this treasure chest, only available to contributors on IndieGoGo. This will never be produced again or sold anywhere.</p>
<p><img align=""none"" alt=""Treasure Chest"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://dl.dropbox.com/u/2188428/treasure_chest.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><br/></p>
<p>If I manage to pay for the mold using donations, that’s a huge portion of manufacturing cost, and the price would be as low as $25 for a box of 125 blocks. That’s an amazing price point for something like this. I don’t even need to reach the goal; even if I only raise part of the cost through donations, the pre-order price will still be lower.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>However, if the idea of donations turns you off, please help by spreading the word as much as possible. The more buzz created by this page, the more likely this will become a real product.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>In fact, simply leaving a comment to the effect of, ""I would pre-order these if they were available,"" would be at LEAST as helpful as a donation.</p>

<p>Thank you for reading and I hope this idea interests you!</p>

If I manage to pay for the mold using donations, that’s a huge portion of manufacturing cost, and the price would be as low as $25 for a box of 125 blocks. That’s an amazing price point for something like this. I don’t even need to reach the goal; even if I only raise part of the cost through donations, the pre-order price will still be lower.

However, if the idea of donations turns you off, please help by spreading the word as much as possible. The more buzz created by this page, the more likely this will become a real product.

In fact, simply leaving a comment to the effect of, ""I would pre-order these if they were available,"" would be at LEAST as helpful as a donation.

Thank you for reading and I hope this idea interests you!",2.0,0,"1 Campaign

We need the funding for server space rental for 9 months.(Our game is currently purely multiplayer, so this is a must)The game is working and is in its alpha phase. Please note the game is a Steam-only title.We do not have plans to release it on any other platforms.



If you would like to know more about the game, please check out our website at  http://carvininteractive.com/

    The impact you will have on this project
You alone have the power to make this multiplayer a reality.
This is our first product on Steam, so we would like to make a lasting impression.We always, when building the game, consider what the community has said. We have already incorporated many of the suggestions from the Steam Concept and Greenlight pages.

   The risks & challenges we face 

The biggest challenge at the moment is getting onto the Steam store, as we can only release into early access once the server space is funded. Any additional funding will always go towards production and making the project better for you.



About us

We are passionate, independent developers from Cape Town, South Africa, who started from humble beginnings and graduated top of the class in the Game Design course at Friends of Design college.Over the past 4 years, we have been learning while developing small projects. Carl, our programmer, is now a lecturer at Friends of Design.We have been working on Spiders Wars for the last few years in secrecy.Now it's time to show the world!



    Don't have 1$? Well there are other ways you can help!

Just because you can't donate that doesn't mean you can't help.It would help us a lot if you share this page and make some noise about Spider Wars on social networks. (Shouting it out your window helps too!)

  The Asheville Harry Potter Alliance (AHPA) is one of many chapters of the Harry Potter Alliance, which 
uses fandom and awesomeness to fight for social and economic equality. Since
its creation in September of 2013, the AHPA has accomplished many of its goals, including hosting a food drive for a local food bank, raising money and awareness for This Star Won't Go Out, and collecting 1,111 books for the HPA's annual book drive, Accio Books.<br/><p></p> </div> <div> <h3>Our Goal<br/>
</h3>In order for our chapter to continue to host events to raise money and awareness for local and global issues, we need funding! Our next campaign will again be Accio Books, where we will collect and distribute as many books as we can to those who need them but may not be able to afford it. We also really want to host a Yule Ball sometime in the (hopefully near) future, and that costs a lot of Muggle money.<br/><br/>Anything and everything helps, and is greatly appreciated. But if you can't donate, we understand - you can help us out by just spreading the word!<br/><br/><h3>The Perks</h3>
<p>*If you live in/near Asheville, you can help us save on shipping (and get your perk faster) by having us deliver your perk to you!</p>
<p>At this time we are not allowing international shipping - however, if you simply MUST have a perk and are willing to pay a little extra for our shipping costs, let us know and we'll be happy to work something out!<br/></p>
<p>All of our perks are handmade with love (and magic):<br/></p>

</div></div>","Who We Are
  The Asheville Harry Potter Alliance (AHPA) is one of many chapters of the Harry Potter Alliance, which 
uses fandom and awesomeness to fight for social and economic equality. Since
its creation in September of 2013, the AHPA has accomplished many of its goals, including hosting a food drive for a local food bank, raising money and awareness for This Star Won't Go Out, and collecting 1,111 books for the HPA's annual book drive, Accio Books.   Our Goal
In order for our chapter to continue to host events to raise money and awareness for local and global issues, we need funding! Our next campaign will again be Accio Books, where we will collect and distribute as many books as we can to those who need them but may not be able to afford it. We also really want to host a Yule Ball sometime in the (hopefully near) future, and that costs a lot of Muggle money.Anything and everything helps, and is greatly appreciated. But if you can't donate, we understand - you can help us out by just spreading the word!The Perks
*If you live in/near Asheville, you can help us save on shipping (and get your perk faster) by having us deliver your perk to you!
At this time we are not allowing international shipping - however, if you simply MUST have a perk and are willing to pay a little extra for our shipping costs, let us know and we'll be happy to work something out!
All of our perks are handmade with love (and magic):
Buttons:





Bracelets:


Scarves (*note - Slytherin scarves have sold out!):

""Has seen better days""Piggie Penny Pincher is the heroine of our game. As you can see from the image above she has seen better days. 
Not too long ago, when she decided to go beyond the farm. She packed what she could, which was her little hat and set out for the wild west. She had only heard about it in stories told by the old horses. 
Not knowing what she would find, she had made up her mind to realize her dreams. 
To transform from a simple, carefree, rolling in the mud kinda piggie to the polished kind. The ones she had seen in the picture books. So she set off without a clue and only her dream. 
Once she got the western, she discovered things where exactly as the horses had told, except there was an even bigger gold rush. Only this time, the taxMan

was very interested in the wealth that came from old mine. And he was taxing away without a care as to how much it hurt. 
It is in this world that Piggie must make a buck for herself. Will she make it or ship out back to the pen?   What We Need & What You Get Piggie Penny Pincher is already in development with a working prototype. But in order to complete the game and ship it to the platforms- iOS, Web, we will need some funding.
The goal is to raise enough funds to include the additional levels to the game, additional game play such as jail time for Piggie, debt from the money lender, more dynamic characters such as the sheriff, bandits,  fix bugs and port it to other platforms.
    The Impact A game allows us to develop our imaginations and go into worlds we couldn't have imagined. This will be the first of many of Piggie's adventures(she's that kinda gal). 
Since we learned to be creative from the games we played and stories we read,it is our hope that Piggie Penny Pincher becomes such a game for others so we can continue to give back the gift of imagination and creativity like we where given. 
    Risks & Challenges At present the there aren't any risks with the game. We are currently on track to complete and distribute Piggie Penny Pincher and are looking forward to doing so.

<h3>Why do we need Indiegogo?</h3>
<p>Indiegogo is the perfect platform for us to gauge interest in our project. Over the past year, we have worked on developing and fleshing out the world, story, characters and mechanics of Angels with Scaly Wings. The game is planned out beginning to end, and now we only need the resources to make our vision come alive. You can find a taste of this in our demo, which represents the prologue, as well as the first chapter of the game.</p>
<p>While we would love to continue working on this project in our own free time (as we have so far), a successful Indiegogo campaign will enable us to focus our time on developing the game as well as hire more talent to deliver a quality visual novel. Without your help, this game may never see the light of day.</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>How long is the game going to be?</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>The game is divided into 5 chapters, the first of which you can play in our demo. However, with the different choices you make throughout the course of the whole game, each path and each of the game's 13 endings only represents a part of the overall story of Angels with Scaly Wings.</p>
<p>A single playthrough may only take a couple of hours, but branching paths and replaying the game with different choices are part of the game's design, and as such, it will take much more than a single playthrough to experience everything our game has to offer.</p>
<p>Overall, the story of Angels with Scaly Wings will have a total word count of 150.000 - 200.000 words, which should give you an idea of the overall scope.</p>
<h3>What will the rating be?</h3>
<p>The game is definitely intended for mature audiences.</p>
<p>It certainly doesn’t shy away from showing the violence and its results where applicable - something you can already see in the demo during the investigation scene.</p>
<p>Of course, the optional romance scenes will also do their part.</p>
<h3>What can you tell us about the protagonist?</h3>
<p>Visually, the main character is never defined, so it’s up to the players what they want their main character to be like.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Are you planning to port Angels with Scaly Wings to other platforms, such as Android, iOS or consoles?</h3>
<p>We would love to! After the game's release on PC, Mac OS and Linux, we are planning on porting the game to mobile devices and, depending on the demand, maybe even consoles.</p>
<h3>I already pledged, but now I want to upgrade to a different perk, HELP!</h3>
<p>Please send us a message, so we can assist you with this!</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>I have pledged for the supporter perk or above, now where can I find this ""exclusive backer forum""?</h3>You can find the backer forum at <a href=""http://awsw.yuku.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://awsw.yuku.com</a>.<br/>Unfortunately, it has come to our attention that during creation of a yuku account, you may be presented with an offer of some kind (opt-in), please keep that in mind when you make your accounts and be on the lookout for this to take the appropriate option.<br/> <h3>What else can we do to show our support?</h3>
<p>Spread the word! Share our campaign on Facebook, Twitter or any other social network. Even if there are enough people out there who would love to play this game and help make it a reality, they can only help us if they know about our campaign. The more people we can reach, the better!</p>
<h3>Have any additional questions?</h3>
<p>Please don't hesitate to contact us via our social media channels, email or the contact link towards the top of this page!</p>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Creating a game is no easy feat and as with all game development, there is always the risk of unexpected problems or delays, especially with a small team like us.</p>
<p>However, we have set the release &amp; estimated delivery date to give us a buffer to absorb any unexpected delays or problems we could face before release.</p>
<p>We have now been working on this game for almost a year. With our spare time and our own resources, we have made significant progress already.</p>
<p>We are aware of the responsibility placed on our shoulders once our game is funded. While we are very grateful for the opportunity and trust from our backers, we can also assure you that for us, this project is a work of passion and something all of us want to see made. We will do our utmost to make it a reality.</p>

<p>- An RPG by the designer of <i>Lace &amp; Steel</i> and <i>Albedo</i>,</p>
<p><i>Adventure in a world of endless possibilities!</i><br/></p>
<p><b><br/></b></p>
<p><b>GeneStorm</b> is a new tabletop RPG, powered by the unique new <i> ""Reciprocating Engine""</i> dice system. <br/></p>
<p>The game is set in a weirdly beautiful post-apocalyptic future. This is a world of
majestic vistas – of abandoned cities floating high in the sky, and overgrown ruins brimming with strange new life. Of huge spacecraft the size of cities crashed into
great verdant swamps...</p>
<p>It is a place of terrible
dangers. Of sand storms and radioactive dust, of jungles and broken
lands swarming with terrible, carnivorous life. A place where gateways lead to
a sinister alternative universe where the senses twist and fail, and terrible
entities wait to prey upon the weak - A place of ruined,
shattered civilisation. Of fallen grandeur and prowling, broken death machines.
</p>
<p>- It is a wilderness that
has given birth to astonishing new life. </p>
<p>Characters in <b>GeneStorm</b> are the descendants of survivors
of the great disaster. They are strange beings made from the inter-tangled
genes of all manner of plants and animals. The inheritors of the new earth are
bizarre, colourful and chaotic.</p>
<p>It is an age of a weirdly
beautiful, resurgent nature.</p>
<p>It is the age of the
mutants.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<h4>GeneStorm offers:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Gene-spliced characters. Part animal and part human - even plant life forms! Create hybrid characters of your own design. Character generation possibilities are as infinite as your imagination.<br/>
</li>
<li>Black powder technologies and 'frontier' style survivor tech. Enjoy that 'Firefly' feel!<br/>
</li>
<li>A world filled with vistas, with majesty and danger. Unique life forms and environments to challenge would-be explorers.<br/>
</li>
<li>A unique games system, fun and easy, that actually puts the game play back into gaming!</li>
<li>c. 200 page rule book filled with setting information, creatures, equipment, environments - even a starting 'home base' town for adventurers.<br/>

<h2>

The designer.</h2>
<h3></h3> <p>Paul Kidd has been a professional games designer for 30 years, creating pioneering RPG tabletop games such as <i>""Lace &amp; Steel""</i> and <i>""Albedo""</i>. He has created card games, RPG games supplements, and countless novels - including such hit Dungeons and Dragons novels as <i>""White Plume Mountain""</i>. His long list of computer games titles include design and dialogue work for the <i>""Discworld""</i> computer games, <i>""Nightshade""</i> and <i>""Shadowrun SNES""</i>.</p>
<br/><h2>Why GeneStorm?<br/>
</h2>
<p>The world of <b>GeneStorm</b> has been swept not only by war, but by a weird plague - the ""Chop-Shop"" virus. This caused living creatures to cross-infect one another with their DNA. Over a century and a half later, the virus has mellowed, allowing the evolution of countless colourful forms of hybrid creatures. Player characters can be pure human, tainted humans, or humanoid animal/plant-animal combinations of countless different kinds. Character generation is restricted only by the imagination.<br/></p>
<p>Many people are drawn to the idea of post apocalypse games settings, but become disappointed when the settings turn out to be too alien, too ghastly to be attractive. <b>GeneStorm's</b> setting is intended to be a world players would love to adventure in: a very weird, wild place to call home. It has elements of Steampunk and the Wild West - elements of classical ruin exploring. <br/></p>The game also opens up new boundaries in games engines. The innovative system creates a 'back and forth' between players and the umpire, or player vs player. An element of game play comes back into the role playing experience, enhancing the fun and drama of storytelling. <br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/929037/files/20141014013417-Giga_Moth_Final.jpg?1413275657"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/>
</div> <div> <h2>What We Need<br/>
</h2> <p>To create this game properly, we want to ensure the best possible artistic presentation. Your funding will go to creating covers and internal artwork, maps and layouts - it will cover editing and proof reading. It will ensure an excellent game we can all enjoy.</p>
<p>Production costs include</p>
<ul>
<li>Colour covers</li>
<li>Full digital paintings as internal illustrations for the rules<br/>
</li>
<li>Character artwork and equipment illos<br/>
</li>
<li>Maps</li>
<li>Page layouts<br/>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The game itself will be published both electronically, and in hard copy via print on demand.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h2>Stretch goals<br/>
</h2>
<p>If we can gather funds above our basic level, we will increase and expand the publications for this game.</p>
<ul>
<li>At the $9000 level, we will also publish a huge adventure setting for characters to explore. This setting includes over 200 unique adventures and encounters locations, encounter charts and treasures, with maps covering 2500 square kilometres of terrain. The book includes new equipment, dozens and dozens of new creatures, new rules for hyperspace encounters,  and ghostly echoes of the past.</li>
<li>At the $11,000 level, we will also publish a detailed adventure module based on the tradition of great old 'film noir' treasure hunts. A great treasure awaits - if only the player characters can survive long enough to claim it!</li>
<li>At even higher levels, we will move beyond print on demand for hard copy booksand print versions of the book for distrubution to brick-and-mortar games stores.<br/>
</li>
</ul>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div> <h2>Risks &amp; Challenges</h2>This is decidedly not my first game! The artists are ready, the games system has been well tested and the text is written.<br/><br/>If our funding does not reach the hoped-for levels, we can still produce a game. This version would have a very simplified artwork content. But I promise you - it will be done.<br/><br/>
</div> <div> <h2>Other Ways You Can Help</h2>Even if you aren't a games player, you may still love this setting as a reference for your own storytelling, or as inspiration for your own chracters.<br/><br/>Do tell people about us. Use the 'share' features here on <i>Indiegogo</i>, and spread the word in your  local fandoms and gamer groups!<br/><br/><h1>Current Project Status!</h1>

shattered civilisation. Of fallen grandeur and prowling, broken death machines.

- It is a wilderness that
has given birth to astonishing new life. 
Characters in GeneStorm are the descendants of survivors
of the great disaster. They are strange beings made from the inter-tangled
genes of all manner of plants and animals. The inheritors of the new earth are
bizarre, colourful and chaotic.
It is an age of a weirdly
beautiful, resurgent nature.
It is the age of the
mutants.


GeneStorm offers:

Gene-spliced characters. Part animal and part human - even plant life forms! Create hybrid characters of your own design. Character generation possibilities are as infinite as your imagination.

Black powder technologies and 'frontier' style survivor tech. Enjoy that 'Firefly' feel!

A world filled with vistas, with majesty and danger. Unique life forms and environments to challenge would-be explorers.

A unique games system, fun and easy, that actually puts the game play back into gaming!
c. 200 page rule book filled with setting information, creatures, equipment, environments - even a starting 'home base' town for adventurers.


The book will be produced both as PDF and in hard copy as Print On Demand.

See the games system demos on YouTube!








The designer.
 Paul Kidd has been a professional games designer for 30 years, creating pioneering RPG tabletop games such as ""Lace & Steel"" and ""Albedo"". He has created card games, RPG games supplements, and countless novels - including such hit Dungeons and Dragons novels as ""White Plume Mountain"". His long list of computer games titles include design and dialogue work for the ""Discworld"" computer games, ""Nightshade"" and ""Shadowrun SNES"".
Why GeneStorm?

The world of GeneStorm has been swept not only by war, but by a weird plague - the ""Chop-Shop"" virus. This caused living creatures to cross-infect one another with their DNA. Over a century and a half later, the virus has mellowed, allowing the evolution of countless colourful forms of hybrid creatures. Player characters can be pure human, tainted humans, or humanoid animal/plant-animal combinations of countless different kinds. Character generation is restricted only by the imagination.
Many people are drawn to the idea of post apocalypse games settings, but become disappointed when the settings turn out to be too alien, too ghastly to be attractive. GeneStorm's setting is intended to be a world players would love to adventure in: a very weird, wild place to call home. It has elements of Steampunk and the Wild West - elements of classical ruin exploring. The game also opens up new boundaries in games engines. The innovative system creates a 'back and forth' between players and the umpire, or player vs player. An element of game play comes back into the role playing experience, enhancing the fun and drama of storytelling. 

  What We Need
 To create this game properly, we want to ensure the best possible artistic presentation. Your funding will go to creating covers and internal artwork, maps and layouts - it will cover editing and proof reading. It will ensure an excellent game we can all enjoy.
Production costs include

Colour covers
Full digital paintings as internal illustrations for the rules

Character artwork and equipment illos

Maps
Page layouts


The game itself will be published both electronically, and in hard copy via print on demand.

Stretch goals

If we can gather funds above our basic level, we will increase and expand the publications for this game.

At the $9000 level, we will also publish a huge adventure setting for characters to explore. This setting includes over 200 unique adventures and encounters locations, encounter charts and treasures, with maps covering 2500 square kilometres of terrain. The book includes new equipment, dozens and dozens of new creatures, new rules for hyperspace encounters,  and ghostly echoes of the past.
At the $11,000 level, we will also publish a detailed adventure module based on the tradition of great old 'film noir' treasure hunts. A great treasure awaits - if only the player characters can survive long enough to claim it!
At even higher levels, we will move beyond print on demand for hard copy booksand print versions of the book for distrubution to brick-and-mortar games stores.



 Risks & ChallengesThis is decidedly not my first game! The artists are ready, the games system has been well tested and the text is written.If our funding does not reach the hoped-for levels, we can still produce a game. This version would have a very simplified artwork content. But I promise you - it will be done.
  Other Ways You Can HelpEven if you aren't a games player, you may still love this setting as a reference for your own storytelling, or as inspiration for your own chracters.Do tell people about us.

</div>
<div>Lara's Quest is a childrens game. We are aiming at this market because we imagine a world where a child can play innocent games without the need to proof itself. Children nowadays already have pressure enough to be productive, to be the smartest kid on the block, to fit in.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>What happened with innocence, what happened with simple joy for the fun of joy? Lara's quest wants to bring that back. We want to see a child smile when they play our game and we know Lara's Quest can deliver such smiles.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>What is so special about it? The gameplay is dead easy, yet it invites the child to continue playing because of the world which is created. First we believe in vibrant colors supporting the positive vibe the game has to bring. The game is very peaceful with absolutely no aggression. Simply a girl exploring the world jumping from cloud to cloud collecting things such as fruits and little animals. All supported by nice visual and sound effects.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>You remember as a kid how you loved to go to fairs where you had a pistol with which you had to shoot discs which made certain parts of the scenery come to life? We at Codefinity remember and were absolutely fond of that creative experience. We want to give that experience back to the child.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>The game begins with a static background and every now and then a special cloud will appear. Jumping on such a cloud will make a part of the background come to life. Jump on it and the windmill starts to turn. Jump on another and flowers start to grow in the background. Another cloud could activate butterflies flying on and above those same flowers.

Creating a beautiful game alone just isn't enough. You have to tell the world about it. Marketing a game and making it known is however very costly. Running campaigns on Facebook (maybe even facebook integration for those young at heart adults), gaming sites, children magazines for parents and all such cost a lot of donuts. We need those donuts.

</div></div>","My Story
My name is Steve Jarman; a 35 year old software developer from Sydney, Australia.
 
About two years ago I decided to fulfill my life-long dream of developing video games. Specifically, old-school Role Playing Games (RPGs) in the vein of classics like ""Dungeon Master"" and ""Eye Of The Beholder""; the games that filled my childhood with adventure.
 
 
Recently I started working on a new project called Coldfire Keep and have made some great progress towards building a game that fans of the genre should really enjoy.
 
Unfortunately, I can no longer do it alone and desperately need some financial assistance to ensure that this game is the best that it can possibly be.
 
You can check out some of my completed projects at the following website, including ""Descend"" - my first venture into the world of old-school RPGs.
 
 
 
www.geppetto-games.com
 
The Game
Coldfire Keep is a first-person, grid-based RPG for iPad, Windows, and MacOS. Additional platforms may follow (e.g. Chrome Web Store), but these are still being evaluated and will be secondary launches.
 
The game world encompasses multiple dungeon areas (each with multiple levels) that are linked together by a World Map and overarching plot.
 
Players will build a custom, four-member party from a selection of four class archetypes, across three races.
 
The game will emphasize the key elements of adventure, exploration, puzzle-solving, strategic combat, and FUN.
 
Coldfire Keep takes place in a fantasy world where the battle between good and evil has long been decided, with dark forces ruling the surface and what remains of the races of good driven into hidden underground lairs.
 
What I Need
I have already invested a significant amount of my own money into Coldfire Keep and, as such, have managed to check quite a few things off the list of requirements. I have the computers and software that I'm going to need, minus a couple of inexpensive tools. I will also handle all of the coding, writing, and environment modeling myself, so essentially those items are ""free"" in terms of budgeting.
 
What I do need are funds to pay the various artists who will be contracted in to complete work in the following areas:
 
 

2D Art - GUI, character portraits, title/loading screens, etc.
3D Static Art - Props including weapons, furniture, switches, doors, chests, etc.
3D Creature Art - This is a big one: modeling, texturing, rigging, and animating of the game's numerous enemies and NPCs.
Music - Game theme, and in-game ambient soundtracks.

 
 
 
 
 
These artists are people that I've worked with previously or have already evaluated for suitability to the project. All artists will be fully credited in-game and are considered a ""part of the team"" despite their contract nature.
 
What You Get
All contributors will have their name listed on the official Coldfire Keep website under a â€œContributorsâ€ section. Additionally, some funding levels will result in the contributorâ€™s name being listed within the game credits, as well as copies of the game itself upon completion of development.
 
Other Ways You Can Help
Spread the word!!! If you know people that are fans; folks who remember their struggle against Lord Chaos, or who fondly recall crawling through the sewers beneath Waterdeep, then get them involved. Even if they can just post a link to the Coldfire Keep site on their Facebook page or Twitter account, it will go a long way towards making people aware of the game.
 
Of course, if they'd like to contribute to the funding then that would be fantastic too! :)

The initial $3,000 will be used to pay part of this cost.TIP itself will be a service program, users have to subscribe in order to use it. The contributors of this project will get a big discount on the subscription fees.The ImpactSince the launch of Tank Inspector in Dec.24th, 2013, it is used and favored by over 100,000 people from more than 100 countries. TIP will bring more useful, interesting and stunning features to the players. Here we have a brief list of part of the features being planned:

HD Rendering: Render tanks into high-resolution (e.g. 4000*3000) pictures;

Interversional Comparison: Compare tank stats and models between different version, create animated GIF images to represent the model and armor scheme changes;

Data Query: Query tank stats and batch export for other use;

Modder Utilities: UV exporting, custom camouflage mod previewing

Media Utilities: Collision model with armor markers (so you won't need to explain ""this plate in red has a thickness of 100 mm and that blue plate is a 15 mm spaced armor""), patch-note generation
And there are many features we would like to implement, only if we could get this started.At the same time, we promise that the original Tank Inspector, with all its current and future features, will remain free, maintained and supported.To DonatorsIn the past 4 months, we've received donations of about $200. These donations were spent on maintaining our website and online services.Anyone who donated us can get a perk for free, based on the amount of donation (say, you can get a 3 Months Subscription Pack if you donated $5. Please tell us the Unique Transaction ID (you can find it on your PayPal transaction record) by writing to us from the email of your Tank Inspector account.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>There are different types of <b>Infinions</b> - sure, that their homeplanets are different as well. So in the beginning of <b>SpaceFellows</b> there is always the planet: A barren world begging to be green. The required technology is available - the rest is up to you.

<p>Most new <b>Infinions </b>can be discovered by yourself as a player. And it's not that easy, because some are rare and difficult to explore.

<p>We have as a developer pleasure in creating new habitats suitable for Infinions.

<br/><h2>What are Infinions?</h2>
<p>The <b>Infinions </b>are the inhabitants of your worlds. You may have robots or aliens - or a mixture of both. Your task is to provide them with everything they need in order to grow. Each of your characters is treated individually.</p>
<p>The more you take intense care of your <b>Infinions</b>, the better you will form, and the more you will promote them, the stronger, more elegant, more beautiful and faster they will become. The more experience they have, the more success they will have on their missions. The more power, the better they will perform when prospecting for raw materials such as iron and gold. Maybe you will soon have the coolest <b>Infinions</b>? The rankings will  reveal it to you. Or you will challenge the coolest Infinion. Maybe you could also try to obtain DNA samples from owners to make your own reproductions. You see, in our galaxy everything is possible.</p>
<h2>Where are they from?</h2>
<p>Each <b>Infinion </b>has his own origin. Aliens evolve from <b>DNA samples</b>, however the robots from <b>BIOS</b>. In <b>SpaceFellows</b> you can create both through targeted research, or buy them at the shop. Here you can also find new species.</p>

<h2>Ok they live ... but can they die?</h2>
<p>Your <b>Infinions </b>depend on your care. Without care, they become angry, neglect several things and can fall asleep or power-down in a <b>standby-mode</b>. The longer this state lasts, the more training they will lose. But no, <b>Infinions </b>can't die!</p>
<h2>What can you do with them?</h2>
<p>They are explorers, warriors, adventurers. But <b>Infinions </b>are much more, because they make you <b>rich</b>! By prospecting resources for you, such as <b>iron </b>and <b>gold</b>. Iron is very important for you, it’s your ingame currency, allowing you to perform all your transactions. Gold allows you to fill up your premium reserves.</p>
<p>Whether you are a <b>SpaceFellow</b> with only one Infinion or you possess hundreds of different types, you can have a lot of fun with them: <b>Train</b> them, <b>take care</b> of them, watch them <b>grow</b> and <b>evolve, </b>let them solve <b>mysteries</b> and <b>missions</b>, battle with them in the <b>arena</b> against other Infinions, <b>trade</b> with them, let them evolve an <b>individual</b> <b>character</b>, research <b>new species</b> or <b>hybrids</b>, give them <b>an own profile</b> and <b>history </b>and publish it, let them prospect raw materials and let them become simply <b>the best</b>.</p>

<h2>Risks &amp; Challenges</h2>
<p>SpaceFellows for a long time is already in the works. During these months we have been asked very often as a developer to the test, had to make changes because the technical side has not always been played as we would have liked. There are in the further development emerge from time to time certainly obstacles that were sounpredictable that we can not rule. But we have already been able to solve many problems on our project away and are therefore very confident that upcoming stoneswill prove no more than rocks.</p>
<p>So when we talk of a risk, then it would be more than reflected in a shift in the publication by a few days. However, this will be a matter of course for our supporters and all other space Companions and those who want to be there, announce and report.</p>

Risks & Challenges
SpaceFellows for a long time is already in the works. During these months we have been asked very often as a developer to the test, had to make changes because the technical side has not always been played as we would have liked. There are in the further development emerge from time to time certainly obstacles that were sounpredictable that we can not rule. But we have already been able to solve many problems on our project away and are therefore very confident that upcoming stoneswill prove no more than rocks.
So when we talk of a risk, then it would be more than reflected in a shift in the publication by a few days. However, this will be a matter of course for our supporters and all other space Companions and those who want to be there, announce and report.",16.0,0,"1 Campaign

</h2>
<div>
<b>The Cool</b> is an <b>arcade</b>-ish, ever-changing (and devilishly <b>hard</b>) combination of a <b>runner game</b> and a <b>shoot 'em up</b>, with unique <b>pixel-art</b> graphic and a crazy story. The game consists of <b>12 worlds</b> (each divided into 4 levels of increasing difficulty); while the core of gameplay remains the same, all worlds present new <b>challenges</b>, often changing the way the game is played.</div>
<h2><br/></h2>
<h2>Story Summary</h2> <p>You play as Mike, <b>a skater from the 90s</b>, the most <b>extreme</b> of all humans. An interdimensional being shaped like <b>a minigun</b> asks you for your help in defeating the evil creatures that spread across the parallel universes. Naturally, you agree to help.</p>
<p>The end. The rest of the story consists of witty dialogues and shooting monsters.</p>
<h2><br/></h2>
<h2>Gameplay</h2>
<h4>Core mechanic</h4>
<div>The core mechanic is inspired by some of the runner games in which the player can <b>switch between three lanes to avoid obstacles</b> (or alternatively jump over some of them) but otherwise has no control over the speed or direction of the avatar's <span style=""background-color: initial;"">movement. Then there's also the ongoing onslaught of hundreds of enemies inspired by the shoot 'em up genre. The point of the game is to <b>reach the end</b> of each level and <b>get the best score</b> possible.</span>
</div>
<h4><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Main idea</span></h4>
<div><span style=""background-color: initial;"">The main idea behind The Cool is making the player <b>focus on two things at once</b> - his <b>position</b> on the level and what exactly he's <b>shooting </b>(mind you, the bullets take almost half of the width of the screen). Most of the enemies give points when shot or collided with, but some of them kill the player when he runs into them; others shoot projectiles (either unprovoked or when attacked) or change into indestructible obstacles; then there are those that actually take away the points; and then there's that god-like bastard that kills the player if shot. But there are also enemies that give a million points when destroyed, so that's nice. There are <b>many ways to get the biggest score</b> in The Cool. And there's <b>even more ways to die</b>.</span></div>
<h4>Other features</h4>
<div><span style=""background-color: initial;"">The game is also incredibly <b>fast</b> and the player's speed changes with each level. Every world consists of<b> four levels</b> - Easy, Peasy, Lemon, and Squeezy which last for respectively one, two, three and a half, and five minutes. Each one is a little bit faster and introduces<b> new types of enemies</b> and/or obstacles. Between each level there is a cutscene introducing new challenges in a form of a funny conversation between Mike and the minigun.</span></div>
<div><span style=""background-color: initial;""><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1464348285/monstas_vk1a1n.png"" src="""" style=""width: 620px;height: 732px;""/></p>
<i>Some of the enemies/obstacles from the first three worlds (<i>the objects may differ in the final version of the game given the tweaking and upgrading that will take place later on).</i></i></span></div>
<div>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">The huge amount of </span><b style=""background-color: initial;"">different types of enemies</b><span style=""background-color: initial;"">/obstacles, the </span><b style=""background-color: initial;"">fast pace</b><span style=""background-color: initial;"">, and the </span><b style=""background-color: initial;"">ever-changing gameplay</b><span style=""background-color: initial;""> are the main reasons why the core gameplay mechanics remain so simple. The COOL manages to be incredibly challenging despite the fact the player has to basically switch between three lanes and occasionally jump.</span>
</div>
<h4><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Examples</span></h4>
<div>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">Yadda yadda, how about <b>some examples:</b> <br/></span><span style=""background-color: initial;"">let's take enemies that react in an unusual way to the fact that they are shot (I'll focus on the first three worlds shown in the trailer) - in the Moveja Desert there is a stone elemental that changes into a boulder upon being shot; the player has to jump over it. And since those creatures live in small packs the elementals around the one we interact with might change into boulders as well. Then there cacti which shoot projectiles in general and die when shot, but their remains are a deadly obstacle of its own. On the other hand, in Slavia, the second world, there are no creatures like this. Still though, if you shoot for example a werewolf his human body dies but the angry wolf spirit launches in the direction of your avatar. If you shoot the vilas (three magical young ladies dancing on a field) the minigun loses the ability to shoot which makes the level almost impossible to complete. And then there's also a leshy, the aforementioned god-like creature that instantly kills his adversary upon being shot (but if you don't shoot it and collide with it it takes you to a bonus world filled with berries, so it's not that bad; although some of the berries are poisonous...). And in the third world, there are no creatures that react unusually when shot. They just die.</span>
</div>
<div>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">That's the difference between various types of enemies. Now for<b> the worlds themselves</b>: <br/></span><span style=""background-color: initial;"">the first two worlds consist of three identical lanes with occasional obstacles that take all three of them (like a canyon or part of a small lake; the only difference here is that in Slavia there is a rusalka, a magical female creature, washing herself on one of the lanes and she hates it when someone jumps over her or, even worse - lands on her head). On the other hand, the third world consists of two normal lanes and one that is a railing - Mike, being an extreme skater from the 90s, can <b>grind</b> on it, getting points with every second. So that's a huge difference. In the final version of the game there also will be a world that is nothing more but an old, long bridge hanging over a foggy valley, and it will consist of only one lane; the idea behind this particular angle is inspired by the game Loot Hero DX and will be just an ongoing onslaught (with the need for perfectly timed jumps).</span>
</div>
<h4><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Lore</span></h4>
<div><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Naturally, all those changes to the gameplay will be explained and will remain understandable and<b> consistent</b> within the universe of The COOL thanks to the conversations between our main characters which will be the main source of the <b>lore</b>. The general lack of plot gives the creator a lot of freedom, but it still has to - and will - make sense. If all goes well, there will even be a bestiary that the player can enter from the menu which will talk in detail about every type of enemy.</span></div>
<h4><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Short summary (AKA tl;dr):</span></h4>
<div><ul>
<li>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">three lanes + jumping (most of the time);</span><br/>

</ul></div>
<h4><span style=""background-color: initial;""><span style=""font-size: 24px;letter-spacing: 0px;line-height: 30px;background-color: initial;""><h2><br/></h2>
<h2>Inspiration</h2></span></span></h4>
</div><div> <p>The COOL is inspired by the runner and shoot 'em up games, but also equally much by the main idea behind the good ol' <b>arcade</b> games, which is: being really <b>hard</b> and <b>challenging</b>, but also <b>fun</b> enough to make the player constantly <b>try over</b> <b>and over again</b> until he reaches, first, the end of the level, and then the best score possible. On the other hand, it is a <b>modern game</b>, not just another retro-clone of an arcade game.</p>
<p>Another source of inspiration comes from Tomonobu Itagaki who said:</p>
<blockquote>At first it was easier, but when the testers said ""this is too difficult"", I made it even more difficult.</blockquote>
<p>Still though, the game is possible to beat; <b>it's not hard for the sake of being hard, it's hard to present a challenge.</b></p>
<div>
<h1><br/></h1>
<h1>Graphics </h1>
</div>
<div>When it comes to graphics, pixel-art seems like the obvious choice, given the game's retro feel and the general popularity of pixel-art. Still though, the main reason I chose this path is the fact that pixel-art looks amazing and presents a challenge for the designer - when <b>every pixel matters</b> you really can't make mistakes. What's more, it's often not easy to draw what you have in mind in such a minimalistic way (since a) it has to be small but b) the audience has to be able to tell what they are looking at).</div>
<div>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1464348047/leshy_keml70.png"" src="""" style=""""/><span style=""background-color: initial;""><i>Just look at those details achieved with nothing more but a few pixels (the object may differ in the final version of the game given the tweaking and upgrading that will take place later on).</i></span></p>
<p>On the other hand, in a lot of retro pixel-art games there is constant reskinning of sprites (for example - if we paint a blue sprite red in the next level, it's a completely new sprite). Not in The COOL - almost every sprite is designed from the ground up; almost, because a) it might share some similarities with another because it actually looks good and makes sense (like the two types of enemy skaters) and b) two types of enemies, the blobs and the old ladies are, according to the lore of the game, present in every universe.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1464348813/reskiny_vgpzom.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<i>Different types of blobs and old ladies.</i>
</div>
<div>
<p>Even when reskinned, the sprites usually don't share the same animations (especially when it comes to them dying) and interact with the player - and other sprites - in different ways. For example, the old lady on the far right, with the bag, can be mugged by a mugger and change into the lady without a bag; this changes her dying animation, but also the worth of said mugger - without a bag the player gets 1500 points for shooting him, with the bag - 10000. Another example would be Baba Yaga, a powerful Slavic witch, hiding in the middle, pretending to be an old lady. Shooting her gives the player a million points. On the other hand, accidentally shooting a normal old lady takes away 10000 from our score.</p>
</div>
<h1><br/></h1>
<h1>Music and sound</h1>
<div>Inspired by the amazing soundtrack from Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2 and 3, the music in The COOL will consist mostly of hard and awesome guitar playing. Still though, given the early state of the music and sound design, it is hard to say anything for certain (except for the fact that the music is going to be <b>extreme </b>and there will be sound for everything, from killing enemies to grinding on the railing).</div>
<h1><br/></h1>
<h1>What's still to do</h1>
<div>
<ul>
<li>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">9 of the 12 worlds are still just concepts that need to become reality, which will take a few months;</span><br/>

The 150$ tier contributors' characters will be designed by me (with the contributors' feedback and wishes taken into consideration naturally) and placed in one of the main 12 worlds (which is the main reason why their final design will be done by me - to fit the style of the given world and to keep the game consistent). </div><div>The game will be distributed via e-mail; first, the DRM-free version, and after a successful Steam Greenlight campaign and release, the Steam keys will be provided (for the tiers from 6$ up).

<h1>Hello</h1>
<div>This is a little late for an introduction, but here I am. My name is Adam (AKA naked megalodon), I'm an indie game developer and a passionate gamer. I also know a lot about b-class movies about giant monsters and/or sharks. Given my interests and cultural/film/new medias studies I can promise you a lot of references in The COOL and everything else that I do and write.</div>
<div>I also love poetry. And while it may seem unlikely, poetry, b-class monster flicks, and absurd video games go together quite well. At least in my head.</div>
<div>That being said, I do everything there is to be done in The COOL - the gameplay, the graphics, the writing; story, ideas and so on. That's why it might be taking a little longer than in case of full development teams (especially since I try to pay attention to every pixel there is), but I work on it everyday! So, once it's ready, it will live up to its title - that I can promise.</div>
</div><div>So, that's about it for now. Feel free to contact me with any questions; game, myself or monster flicks related.</div></div>","Introduction


The Cool is an arcade-ish, ever-changing (and devilishly hard) combination of a runner game and a shoot 'em up, with unique pixel-art graphic and a crazy story. The game consists of 12 worlds (each divided into 4 levels of increasing difficulty); while the core of gameplay remains the same, all worlds present new challenges, often changing the way the game is played.

Story Summary You play as Mike, a skater from the 90s, the most extreme of all humans. An interdimensional being shaped like a minigun asks you for your help in defeating the evil creatures that spread across the parallel universes. Naturally, you agree to help.
The end. The rest of the story consists of witty dialogues and shooting monsters.

Gameplay
Core mechanic
The core mechanic is inspired by some of the runner games in which the player can switch between three lanes to avoid obstacles (or alternatively jump over some of them) but otherwise has no control over the speed or direction of the avatar's movement. Then there's also the ongoing onslaught of hundreds of enemies inspired by the shoot 'em up genre. The point of the game is to reach the end of each level and get the best score possible.

Main idea
The main idea behind The Cool is making the player focus on two things at once - his position on the level and what exactly he's shooting (mind you, the bullets take almost half of the width of the screen). Most of the enemies give points when shot or collided with, but some of them kill the player when he runs into them; others shoot projectiles (either unprovoked or when attacked) or change into indestructible obstacles; then there are those that actually take away the points; and then there's that god-like bastard that kills the player if shot. But there are also enemies that give a million points when destroyed, so that's nice. There are many ways to get the biggest score in The Cool. And there's even more ways to die.
Other features
The game is also incredibly fast and the player's speed changes with each level. Every world consists of four levels - Easy, Peasy, Lemon, and Squeezy which last for respectively one, two, three and a half, and five minutes. Each one is a little bit faster and introduces new types of enemies and/or obstacles. Between each level there is a cutscene introducing new challenges in a form of a funny conversation between Mike and the minigun.

Some of the enemies/obstacles from the first three worlds (the objects may differ in the final version of the game given the tweaking and upgrading that will take place later on).

The huge amount of different types of enemies/obstacles, the fast pace, and the ever-changing gameplay are the main reasons why the core gameplay mechanics remain so simple. The COOL manages to be incredibly challenging despite the fact the player has to basically switch between three lanes and occasionally jump.

Examples

Yadda yadda, how about some examples: let's take enemies that react in an unusual way to the fact that they are shot (I'll focus on the first three worlds shown in the trailer) - in the Moveja Desert there is a stone elemental that changes into a boulder upon being shot; the player has to jump over it. And since those creatures live in small packs the elementals around the one we interact with might change into boulders as well. Then there cacti which shoot projectiles in general and die when shot, but their remains are a deadly obstacle of its own. On the other hand, in Slavia, the second world, there are no creatures like this. Still though, if you shoot for example a werewolf his human body dies but the angry wolf spirit launches in the direction of your avatar. If you shoot the vilas (three magical young ladies dancing on a field) the minigun loses the ability to shoot which makes the level almost impossible to complete. And then there's also a leshy, the aforementioned god-like creature that instantly kills his adversary upon being shot (but if you don't shoot it and collide with it it takes you to a bonus world filled with berries, so it's not that bad; although some of the berries are poisonous...). And in the third world, there are no creatures that react unusually when shot. They just die.


That's the difference between various types of enemies. Now for the worlds themselves: the first two worlds consist of three identical lanes with occasional obstacles that take all three of them (like a canyon or part of a small lake; the only difference here is that in Slavia there is a rusalka, a magical female creature, washing herself on one of the lanes and she hates it when someone jumps over her or, even worse - lands on her head). On the other hand, the third world consists of two normal lanes and one that is a railing - Mike, being an extreme skater from the 90s, can grind on it, getting points with every second. So that's a huge difference. In the final version of the game there also will be a world that is nothing more but an old, long bridge hanging over a foggy valley, and it will consist of only one lane; the idea behind this particular angle is inspired by the game Loot Hero DX and will be just an ongoing onslaught (with the need for perfectly timed jumps).

Lore
Naturally, all those changes to the gameplay will be explained and will remain understandable and consistent within the universe of The COOL thanks to the conversations between our main characters which will be the main source of the lore. The general lack of plot gives the creator a lot of freedom, but it still has to - and will - make sense. If all goes well, there will even be a bestiary that the player can enter from the menu which will talk in detail about every type of enemy.
Short summary (AKA tl;dr):


three lanes + jumping (most of the time);

fast-paced;

constant shooting;


main challenge: to focus on two things at once;

dying;
repeat until you get the best score;
more dying;
over a hundred types of enemies and obstacles;
gameplay changing with every world and level;
more dying; like, honestly, there's a lot of dying


Inspiration
 The COOL is inspired by the runner and shoot 'em up games, but also equally much by the main idea behind the good ol' arcade games, which is: being really hard and challenging, but also fun enough to make the player constantly try over and over again until he reaches, first, the end of the level, and then the best score possible. On the other hand, it is a modern game, not just another retro-clone of an arcade game.
Another source of inspiration comes from Tomonobu Itagaki who said:
At first it was easier, but when the testers said ""this is too difficult"", I made it even more difficult.
Still though, the game is possible to beat; it's not hard for the sake of being hard, it's hard to present a challenge.


Graphics 

When it comes to graphics, pixel-art seems like the obvious choice, given the game's retro feel and the general popularity of pixel-art. Still though, the main reason I chose this path is the fact that pixel-art looks amazing and presents a challenge for the designer - when every pixel matters you really can't make mistakes. What's more, it's often not easy to draw what you have in mind in such a minimalistic way (since a) it has to be small but b) the audience has to be able to tell what they are looking at).

Just look at those details achieved with nothing more but a few pixels (the object may differ in the final version of the game given the tweaking and upgrading that will take place later on).
On the other hand, in a lot of retro pixel-art games there is constant reskinning of sprites (for example - if we paint a blue sprite red in the next level, it's a completely new sprite). Not in The COOL - almost every sprite is designed from the ground up; almost, because a) it might share some similarities with another because it actually looks good and makes sense (like the two types of enemy skaters) and b) two types of enemies, the blobs and the old ladies are, according to the lore of the game, present in every universe.


Different types of blobs and old ladies.


Even when reskinned, the sprites usually don't share the same animations (especially when it comes to them dying) and interact with the player - and other sprites - in different ways. For example, the old lady on the far right, with the bag, can be mugged by a mugger and change into the lady without a bag; this changes her dying animation, but also the worth of said mugger - without a bag the player gets 1500 points for shooting him, with the bag - 10000. Another example would be Baba Yaga, a powerful Slavic witch, hiding in the middle, pretending to be an old lady. Shooting her gives the player a million points. On the other hand, accidentally shooting a normal old lady takes away 10000 from our score.


Music and sound
Inspired by the amazing soundtrack from Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2 and 3, the music in The COOL will consist mostly of hard and awesome guitar playing. Still though, given the early state of the music and sound design, it is hard to say anything for certain (except for the fact that the music is going to be extreme and there will be sound for everything, from killing enemies to grinding on the railing).

What's still to do



9 of the 12 worlds are still just concepts that need to become reality, which will take a few months;


music and sound;


menus;

cut-scenes.

As you can see, there's a lot to be done but the core mechanics and the first three worlds are mostly finished and implemented. Also, all the software needed has already been purchased,

Rewards

Once the game is released there will be playable credits. In it, probably as part of the background, there will be the names of all the contributors. 70$ and 100$ tier contributors can design their own mobs for this particular credits-world. The 200$ contributors will help design the other mobs and the backgrounds, the lanes, whatever they please (naturally, all the designs will have to meet certain size and style - i.e. pixel-art - requirements to fit the game). The 150$ tier contributors' characters will be designed by me (with the contributors' feedback and wishes taken into consideration naturally) and placed in one of the main 12 worlds (which is the main reason why their final design will be done by me - to fit the style of the given world and to keep the game consistent). The game will be distributed via e-mail; first, the DRM-free version, and after a successful Steam Greenlight campaign and release, the Steam keys will be provided (for the tiers from 6$ up). The beta tests will be held once at least 6 worlds are fully completed or once all 12 worlds have at least one level ready, depending on the development process. Wallpapers, screensavers and posters will be delivered after the game's release (the DRM-free one) since the completion of The COOL is the obvious top priority. The Hieronymus Bosch inspired picture will be delivered within 6 months after the release since it's going to take quite a lot of hard work to produce the best results.Steam GreenlightIf you have a Steam account and would like to bring the release of The COOL on that platform closer - or just generally help me a lot - please go and vote for my game here. Every vote means a world to me!

The money
Where it goesI wish I had a lovely chart showing exactly where the money goes, but most of it will simply cover my costs of living for about 2-3 months. A small chunk of it will be inevitably devoured by taxes, fees, and charges (there's a lot of them!), but what can one do. If you would like to learn more details, please feel free to contact me.Why flexible fundingI will finish The COOL no matter the success of this campaign. It's my absurd and extreme passion project and there's no way I'm gonna let it die. However, I need time to do so and time is virtually money. That's why I've chosen the flexible funding - even if the campaign fails, every little piece of gold will bring me closer to finishing the game.
Stretch goals
Yes, I believe in this campaign so much that I have those.

2000$ - two more worlds, ready either on release or delivered later as a free DLC (for all the 5$+ backers).
2500$ - an Android version of the game (for all the 5$+ backers).
3000$ - an iOS version of the game (for all the 5$+ backers).
3500$ - I will buy a professional recorder and record all the sounds for the game in the ""wild"".


Hello
This is a little late for an introduction, but here I am. My name is Adam (AKA naked megalodon), I'm an indie game developer and a passionate gamer. I also know a lot about b-class movies about giant monsters and/or sharks. Given my interests and cultural/film/new medias studies I can promise you a lot of references in The COOL and everything else that I do and write.
I also love poetry. And while it may seem unlikely, poetry, b-class monster flicks, and absurd video games go together quite well. At least in my head.
That being said, I do everything there is to be done in The COOL - the gameplay, the graphics, the writing; story, ideas and so on. That's why it might be taking a little longer than in case of full development teams (especially since I try to pay attention to every pixel there is), but I work on it everyday! So, once it's ready, it will live up to its title - that I can promise.
So, that's about it for now. Feel free to contact me with any questions; game, myself or monster flicks related.",4.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<h3><u>Risks and challenges</u></h3>
<p><strong>Requirements Creep:</strong> There are numerous cases where some developers keep adding new features but never release a playable game. Roosevelt Games, LLC developers are well aware of this trap and adopts strict development and delivery schedules. We work in a 2-week sprint and deliver something functional at the end of the two weeks. We will also regularly post updates to Kickstarter, IndieGoGo, the Facebook page, and in the Discord channel to show our progress.</p>
<p><strong>Delay in development:</strong> The team has completed the majority of the game development work (e.g., 3D model creation, 3D animations for each character or creatures, converting files to Unreal Engine 4, soundtrack design). So, any delays might be related to programming rest of the game story, localization, level design, and if the team loses any principal developer due to any unforeseen event. In such cases, the CEO will notify the backers and describe what the team is doing to meet the original release date.</p>
<p><strong>Run out of Funds:</strong> The developers of GODS™ have run through various scenarios and did a very detailed cost analysis to make this game happen.

<p>Instead of dealing damage to other players with weapons like in several other browsergames, you alone or your group can deal ""damage"" by either sending your <strong>bot friends</strong> to other players or performing a certain action to send <strong>a random bot.</strong> (remember: friends = less spare time &amp; DP).</p>
<h1>Bot-personalities</h1>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/000/505/482/1adc9456dd7668c75ede8cd30218d5a4_large.jpg?1365590474"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>There are five different personalities for bots. Each bot can only have one of them. By dizzing them you can find out which bot has which personality. So you can choose the right action that will damage the bot the most.</p>
<h1><strong>Bot-sharing</strong></h1>
<p><strong><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/000/505/483/7c1a4cd6b8e6b750f56286e48f15a89e_large.jpg?1365590506"" src="""" style=""""/></strong></p>
<p>Bots can be in more than one friend list. A bot can’t focus on a single player when it’s in several lists. You can try to find out which bot is linked with another player, making the bot more vulnerable. If other players damage a shared bot and lose them as their friend, the bot will be stronger for you because he can now focus on a single person.</p>
<h1><strong>Anti-Profile</strong></h1>
<p><strong><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/000/505/294/86b6f2c9b405f3b6847a22d2624485e7_large.jpg?1365582340"" src="""" style=""""/></strong></p>
<p>Furthermore, you can create a profile which you can only fill with things you don’t like, for example your least favorite movie. You can also share activities and hobbies you hate.</p>
<h1><strong>Personality Test (optional)</strong></h1>
<p><strong><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/000/505/488/0139e504e40071d4329295ed829cfb05_large.jpg?1365590585"" src="""" style=""""/></strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p>To assign you to a certain character group you can do a personality test at the beginning of the game. You will benefit from the test because it will be used to see what kind of sabotage will hurt you less. If you don’t take the personality test the chances of being assigned a friend will be a little bit higher than if you do take it.</p>

Anyway, there are some challenges which can barely be planned at all, those will be the tricky ones. For example, testing the game balance can possibly take much longer as predicted.

<p>After telling you some of the challenges we have to deal with, we want you to know that, even though we are quite experienced, we will also cooperate with different companies to ensure that Dizzlike! will make it! We are confident to manage each challenge by the time we have to face it. We will also stay in contact with you throughout the whole process until the game is fully developed and keep you updated.</p>

</div></div>","Dizzlike - Here you can do what you shouldn't! It's a free-to-play Facebook-RPG-browsergame (FB-App) with an unusual multiplayer part!


Tired of receiving constantly game requests? So are we! In ""Dizzlike"" you will not receive any bonuses for sharing or inviting.
The reason why you guys are able to watch this video right now is because we have an obsession with this game called ""Dizzlike"" and we want to share it with you and the world! Money is an issue though, and we would hereby ask you to help us to get the game on track!


Your goal is to have as few friends as possible but you can’t simply unfriend them or turn a friend request down because you are ""too politically correct"". They have to unfriend you! Rank up each time you lose friends, and one day, you will become the “Master of Dizzlike”. But be aware, it won't be so easy, there will be a few surprises in Dizzlike.
Let's start!
*** Please read this - colors are important ***

*** Have you read it? ***
First: Import your friendprofiles

In Dizzlike you can customize your own levels and bosses! Choose which of your Facebook friends will be imported and assign them to a level.
 

 

 
How to play (graphics are drafts!)
Dizzlike is a browsergame (Facebook App) - you can click through your “Hatelist” (the list where you can see your friends), perform (over 9,000) dizzes...



 

...and actions (pranks you play which deal more damage than dizzes) by clicking on a certain friend...
 

 
 

...and train to unlock more features.

 
Multiplayer!

Just like in Facebook there is the option to join a group. If you do so you’ll be able to perform more powerful actions and dizzes in a team. Be aware: Joining a group will automatically make all group members your friends!


Instead of dealing damage to other players with weapons like in several other browsergames, you alone or your group can deal ""damage"" by either sending your bot friends to other players or performing a certain action to send a random bot. (remember: friends = less spare time & DP).
Bot-personalities

There are five different personalities for bots. Each bot can only have one of them. By dizzing them you can find out which bot has which personality. So you can choose the right action that will damage the bot the most.
Bot-sharing

Bots can be in more than one friend list. A bot can’t focus on a single player when it’s in several lists. You can try to find out which bot is linked with another player, making the bot more vulnerable. If other players damage a shared bot and lose them as their friend, the bot will be stronger for you because he can now focus on a single person.
Anti-Profile

Furthermore, you can create a profile which you can only fill with things you don’t like, for example your least favorite movie. You can also share activities and hobbies you hate.
Personality Test (optional)

 
To assign you to a certain character group you can do a personality test at the beginning of the game. You will benefit from the test because it will be used to see what kind of sabotage will hurt you less. If you don’t take the personality test the chances of being assigned a friend will be a little bit higher than if you do take it.

<h2>
<img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i49.tinypic.com/1586ws6.png"" src="""" style=""vertical-align: bottom;""/> Welcome!</h2>
<p>Welcome to the crowd-funding campaign for ""<em>Ghost of a Tale</em>"", which is a small game where you play a little mouse on a quest in a medieval world populated by animals.</p>
<p>At this point it might be good for you to take a look at the video, if you haven't done so already. It's a bit rough, with missing assets, temporary animations and incomplete gameplay of course, but it should give you a feel for the project.</p>
<p><img alt=""Standing on the shore"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/654499/pictures/full/20130209082037-ghost_01.jpg?1360426843"" src="""" style=""vertical-align: middle;""/></p>
<p>Among the inspirations I could quote Disney's ""<em>Robin Hood</em>"", the fables of La Fontaine, ""<em>Redwall</em>"", ""<em>Winnie the Pooh</em>"", ""<em>The Secret of Nimh</em>"", ""<em>The Dark Crystal</em>"", the paintings of Alan Lee, John Howe, Paul Bonner, John Bauer, and many, many others...</p>
<p>Game-wise the inspirations could be found in the early ""<em>Zelda</em>"" games, ""<em>Ico</em>"", the ""<em>Gothic</em>"" series and ""<em>Dark Souls</em>"". Of course those are mere inspirations; this project can obviously not expect to compete on equal footing with those amazing games.</p>
<p>But my goal is to craft a small yet beautiful game with environments that look a bit like movie sets and characters that have a sense of stylization in their design, while retaining a certain simplicity and immediacy as far as gameplay is involved.</p>
<p>I know it sounds hockey but I'm really trying to recapture the sense of wonder I felt as a kid when I discovered the games from the 80s and early 90s. But with a AAA quality (as far as I'm able) that's very much up-to-date.</p>
<h2>
<img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i49.tinypic.com/1586ws6.png"" src="""" style=""vertical-align: bottom;""/> Who develops this game?</h2>
<p>Well, my name is Lionel Gallat but I usually go by Seith when I'm online. I've been working as a supervising animator in the movie industry for more than 15 years, first at Dreamworks on many movies (""<em>The Prince Of Egypt</em>"", ""<em>The Road to Eldorado</em>"", ""<em>Spirit</em>"", ""<em>Sinbad</em>"", ""<em>SharkTale</em>"", etc...), and more recently as the animation director for Universal Studios' ""<em>Despicable Me</em>"" and ""<em>The Lorax</em>"" (yay for the Macguff team!).</p>
<p><img alt=""A mysterious door"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/654512/pictures/full/20130209082937-ghost_02.jpg?1360427382"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>""<em>Ghost of a Tale</em>"" is a work of love and a one-man project (at least so far). It represents a lot of work. About a year ago I decided to get really serious about it. In consequence I started working full-time on the development. It's a bit scary of course, but I do believe in this project, and it's now time for me to find out if I'm the only one. Which is also pretty scary in itself...</p>
<h2>
<img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i49.tinypic.com/1586ws6.png"" src="""" style=""vertical-align: bottom;""/> Why didn't you start a campaign sooner?</h2>
<p>Well, I have never created a video-game before and I didn't want to come to you guys before being convinced that I could actually deliver something up to a decent level of quality.</p>
<p>I had been struggling for almost a year with a 3D engine famous for its amazing visuals, and I was just going nowhere fast (I don't program in C++). I thought that I would have to accept this was simply beyond my abilities. But then I switched to a different 3D engine and suddenly everything clicked.</p>
<p>So I started again from scratch with a new pipeline and in about 2 months I was able to bang together the alpha you see in the video. And that includes learning a new programming language (called C#).</p>
<h2>
<img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i49.tinypic.com/1586ws6.png"" src="""" style=""vertical-align: bottom;""/> So what's the game about?</h2>
<p>You play as a mouse on an adventure set in a medieval world. At the beginning of the game, you get to the Island of Periclave. Now what is the mouse looking for? What happened on the island? Why are there undead rats roaming around? That will be up to you to discover.</p>
<p>What's known is that the island has long been a disputed outpost for the Army of the Rats. But today, it is reputed to be haunted. And tales are talking about a fabulous treasure high up in the Tower of Periclave. But it would be folly to try and get there. Even for a mighty warrior. And this little mouse certainly doesn't look like one...</p>
<p><img alt=""Wide vista"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/654517/pictures/full/20130209083507-ghost_03.jpg?1360427712"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h2>
<img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i49.tinypic.com/1586ws6.png"" src="""" style=""vertical-align: bottom;""/> Is the game going to be like ""Skyrim""?</h2>

Seith</div></div>","Note: Le jeu sera aussi disponible en français!

 Welcome!
Welcome to the crowd-funding campaign for ""Ghost of a Tale"", which is a small game where you play a little mouse on a quest in a medieval world populated by animals.
At this point it might be good for you to take a look at the video, if you haven't done so already. It's a bit rough, with missing assets, temporary animations and incomplete gameplay of course, but it should give you a feel for the project.

Among the inspirations I could quote Disney's ""Robin Hood"", the fables of La Fontaine, ""Redwall"", ""Winnie the Pooh"", ""The Secret of Nimh"", ""The Dark Crystal"", the paintings of Alan Lee, John Howe, Paul Bonner, John Bauer, and many, many others...
Game-wise the inspirations could be found in the early ""Zelda"" games, ""Ico"", the ""Gothic"" series and ""Dark Souls"". Of course those are mere inspirations; this project can obviously not expect to compete on equal footing with those amazing games.
But my goal is to craft a small yet beautiful game with environments that look a bit like movie sets and characters that have a sense of stylization in their design, while retaining a certain simplicity and immediacy as far as gameplay is involved.
I know it sounds hockey but I'm really trying to recapture the sense of wonder I felt as a kid when I discovered the games from the 80s and early 90s. But with a AAA quality (as far as I'm able) that's very much up-to-date.

 Who develops this game?
Well, my name is Lionel Gallat but I usually go by Seith when I'm online. I've been working as a supervising animator in the movie industry for more than 15 years, first at Dreamworks on many movies (""The Prince Of Egypt"", ""The Road to Eldorado"", ""Spirit"", ""Sinbad"", ""SharkTale"", etc...), and more recently as the animation director for Universal Studios' ""Despicable Me"" and ""The Lorax"" (yay for the Macguff team!).

""Ghost of a Tale"" is a work of love and a one-man project (at least so far). It represents a lot of work. About a year ago I decided to get really serious about it. In consequence I started working full-time on the development. It's a bit scary of course, but I do believe in this project, and it's now time for me to find out if I'm the only one. Which is also pretty scary in itself...

 Why didn't you start a campaign sooner?
Well, I have never created a video-game before and I didn't want to come to you guys before being convinced that I could actually deliver something up to a decent level of quality.
I had been struggling for almost a year with a 3D engine famous for its amazing visuals, and I was just going nowhere fast (I don't program in C++). I thought that I would have to accept this was simply beyond my abilities. But then I switched to a different 3D engine and suddenly everything clicked.
So I started again from scratch with a new pipeline and in about 2 months I was able to bang together the alpha you see in the video. And that includes learning a new programming language (called C#).

 So what's the game about?
You play as a mouse on an adventure set in a medieval world. At the beginning of the game, you get to the Island of Periclave. Now what is the mouse looking for? What happened on the island? Why are there undead rats roaming around? That will be up to you to discover.
What's known is that the island has long been a disputed outpost for the Army of the Rats. But today, it is reputed to be haunted. And tales are talking about a fabulous treasure high up in the Tower of Periclave. But it would be folly to try and get there. Even for a mighty warrior. And this little mouse certainly doesn't look like one...


 Is the game going to be like ""Skyrim""?
No, it isn't. ""Skyrim"" and the ""Zelda"" games are huge open-world games which required dozens of persons to work for years, backed by multimillion dollars budgets. I work alone on an aging computer and live at the moment on my rapidly depleting savings.
So ""Ghost of a Tale"" should be construed as a smaller game with a beginning, a middle and an end. If the endeavor is successful however, then it will only be the beginning of a longer story arc.


 What about game mechanics?
There will be exploration, running and jumping around, reading journals, finding clues, discovering secrets and fighting melee/ranged combats.
You shouldn't expect a straight monster-bashing action game. Nor should you expect a purely cerebral adventure game with no elements of action at all. The game will be a mixture of both genres (most commonly referred to as ""action-adventure with a hint of RPG"").

 Why are you asking for money?
Because then I could pay the people who have recently offered their help on the project, just based on some screenshots. I would be able to properly hire them. And I can't do that on my savings alone.
Because, as you can hear, Jeremiah did a wonderful job on the music for the alpha trailer and I know he would do an equally stellar job on the game itself. And I don't think he should work for free.
Because I have to buy upgrades for several expensive professional programs/licenses so they're up to today's standards.
Because my computer is 4 years old and my graphic card is definitely not optimized for video-games.

Given all those elements plus the cost for the development itself and the perks proposed, the budget set for this campaign is the bare minimum. Therefore it is set as a ""fixed funding"" type, which just means that if the minimum goal is not reached by the deadline, then the project won't receive any money at all. It's all or nothing, I guess.On the opposite, in the unlikely event that funding were to overshoot this goal, then it would mean three things: the game would become even more lush, story points would get developed further (which means more locations to explore, more characters to interact with), and the overall scope of the game would get wider (while retaining its original intimate core). It would also be a sure sign that I am in fact asleep and dreaming.

 Can I have any input in the game's development?
I'm open to suggestions and ideas! And even though I do have a pretty precise picture of what I would like the game to be, I always welcome helpful advices and stimulating opinions.
I will also ask questions, share thought process and just plain talk about the different technical aspects of the game's creation. And you should feel free to chime in too.


 When will the game be done?
I'm aiming for the first half of 2014. But given my lack of experience in the matter, it could very well be the end of 2014.
In any case, closed beta should happen towards December 2013 at the latest.

 Regarding ""the perks""...
The game won't be burdened by any DRM. If a person decides to enjoy the game without acknowledging the efforts that went into creating it, there's nothing I can do about it. But somehow hindering honest players' experience does not strike me as a viable solution.
 

The final game will be available in both English and Français.
 
This is a special extended take (3m45s) of the music Jeremiah Pena created for the alpha trailer video. You should be able to download the MP3 within a couple of weeks after the end of the campaign.
 

The final soundtrack of the game will also be composed by Jeremiah. It will feature all the themes developed during the course of the game and will be available as a digital download.

</div></div>","We’re Sojo Studios and we make games you Play for Good.  While we’re a young company, thanks to our amazing players, we’ve already donated over $700,000 to non-profits helping children and animals around the world!
Our newest game, Joy Pets, will help rescued animals when you play. We’re excited to launch the game this summer, but we got to thinking... why wait to help the animals? Knowing our players’ passion for doing good, they’ll want to help now! 
Our goal is to feed 250,000 homeless pets before we launch, and we need $10,000 to do it.
100% of the money we raise in this campaign will go to feed dogs and cats in rescue shelters in the United States and Canada.
 



We need $10,000 to provide 250,000 meals to shelter animals. All of the money that we raise will go directly to GreaterGood.org and The Animal Rescue Site, who will oversee the distribution of food to shelters.

If we don't reach our goal of $10,000, then 100% of the money we do raise will still go to GreaterGood.org to feed shelter animals.

 




Joy Pets is a new Android game that helps real animals in local animal shelters near you. In Joy Pets, you take care of an adorable virtual pet like Mutt Pup here... feed him... clean him... play games with him, and raise him into a happy and healthy adult! Pretty awesome, right?

What's really awesome though, is that when you adopt your virtual pet, you’ll also ""adopt"" a real animal at a local shelter near you!
Joy for your virtual pet = support for real pets
In Joy Pets, you earn ""Joy"" as your virtual pet grows up. The more Joy you earn, the more real support you provide for the real pet you've selected in the game. It's that simple.
And when the real pet you're supporting is adopted by his or her forever home, you get to choose a new real animal near you to be your virtual pet's new best friend.
The more you play, the more real animals you can help!
 

Sojo Studios has partnered with The Animal Rescue Site (a part of GreaterGood.org) and The Petfinder Foundation to turn your gameplay into real world good.
The Animal Rescue Site has been providing rescued animals with meals for over 10 years, which makes them the perfect partner to help us feed hungry cats and dogs. Petfinder helps Joy Pets players find local pets around the United States through their database of over 13,000 adoption groups and more than 300,000 pets!
 

Aside from the satisfaction of helping animals in need, you'll also receive the following perks, provided by Sojo Studios and The Animal Rescue Site:

<p></p><p></p></div>","Positivity & ConnectionWelcome to Positivities - A Game for Human Connection.  Positivities is based on 30 Human Strengths found in the Elements of Positivity deck; the deck also contains 4 Wild Cards to add your own word of strength.  Game play is directed conversation or contemplation based on various uses of the cards.  Positivities is both playful and heartfelt.  You can play alone or with a group - from just one significant other to playing as a party game with as many as 34 people.  Game play explores the web of human strengths that we all live within.  Something magical happens with this intent - the focus on the positive makes it easy to open up, and people find themselves swept up into sharing the best of who they are.  Everyone who plays is touched in one way or another.  Strangers get to know each other on a surprisingly deep level and friends and partners of many years learn something new about each other or share some newly-spoken appreciation for each other.THE GAMESPositivities turns the art of conversation into a friendly and engaging game.  Play proceeds in many ways, depending on the game - there are 12 different ways to play - but in the majority of games players draw one or more cards and then share an inspiration or experience based on the draw, sometimes about themselves, sometimes about the other player(s).  A revelation is the diversity of strengths revealed within the play of the game - particularly in the way these webs of strength interplay with each other.  Games include:
Between Friends
Best of Friends
A Daily Practice
The Creative Self: Story-Telling
The Creative Self: Journalling
The Creative Self: Art Story
The Creative Self: Poeticism
Couples Connect
A Strength Mosaic
Core Strength
Time Travel
Zen Mastery
                                                                                                                 Sea of StrengthThe Inspiration of Positivities
My name is Danzante Caldera and I am a therapist in private practice in New Westminster, BC.  I also love board games...  

The inspiration for this game came to me while I was doing further research in the field of Positive Psychology.  I created a list of many human strengths that researchers have identified, added some additional ones I thought important, and suddenly had a list of 30 human strengths.  
  
I thought about how we as human beings put so much good, strong energy into the world and so often don't acknowledge these strengths in ourselves - and many times we aren't even fully aware of them.  Somewhere in here the inspiration for Positivities was born.
Players exploring Positivities have included many small and large groups and players new to each other as well as spouses and best friends.  The game has been used in leading groups for differently-abled teenagers, and also in private counselling sessions.  A common reaction is surprise at exactly how deeply players have been touched and charmed by the game.
What We Need & What You GetHere's how the $6000 campaign goal break down: roughly $4000, printing costs, dry-erase markers, eraser, and packaging; $2000, Campaign costs, production costs, and marketing.  Putting all the parts of this game together is a surprisingly expensive proposition, but through some diligence a printer was found who could make the magic happen.  There were many challenges but through hours of research we've been able to create a path to producing this game for a reasonable cost, but only if we do it at a sufficient volume.  As to the $2000 campaign costs; again a surprisingly complex and costly proposition - but one which produced a heartfelt, purposeful message that conveys well the feeling of the game. 
Our Stretch Goal is $10,000; If this good fortune were to occur, the extra funds will go primarily toward online marketing.
If, however, we come just short of our goal; The game will still be produced but in a much smaller and more expensive first run.  This will make the margin for success more difficult but we still will work towards success. 

                 (Note:  This image shows crayons, but the game will actually include                                    a specially produced ""Positivities"" mini-dry erase marker) ...AND NOW, ON TO THE PERKS!

$10 Coupon - Every perk will include a $10 coupon off the game in our Square Market store, which will open shortly after the fundraising campaign.  If you're perk includes a game, you will then also have one to gift at 40% off...

Affirmation Perks - A handy affirmation of your Strength;  Mail any word of Strength in with your order and you get a pen, mousepad, or coffee mug (depending on Perk level) with that word printed on it.  A great daily reminder of your own unique strength...
 Get the Game - For $25, which will be the retail cost of the game, you receive the game PLUS the $10 coupon so that you can order one later as a gift.

Workshop - As a therapist I've delivered a variety of workshops in the past, and I have developed one with Positivities as the main tool, with the focal point of the workshop being that of nurturing positivity as a daily habit and awareness.  This may be most effective in a professional setting, and would be a great addition to any wellness initiatives your company may have.

<p>·<span> 
</span>The controller will
lead the game to another level both for you and for us. On our side, we
will discover a brand new technology we’ll never use before and on your side
you’ll fell like playing Blade Lords on an arcade and/or console. You should
know that for the moment, we don’t really know which controller to choose. The
idea of the MadCatz controller came up, but nothing has been decided yet. We’ll
continue our researches on the domain, but in the meantime, if you have some
tips or envies don’t hesitate to share them with us :)</p><p></p><p>                                     <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/425833/files/20140311035804-Mad_Catz_CTRL-580-90.jpg?1394535484"" src="""" style=""width: 277.7680250783699px; height: 156px;""/></p><br/><p></p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>A completely new fighter
will be added to the game. Then it means a completely new gameplay such as
attacks, combos and Heaven Art as well as new items such as weapons and armors. By the way, if you contribute, you'll be able to choose which new character you'd like to have in the game, between these three :)! Which one will you choose? Balmung the pirate, Kokoro the Geisha or Vlade the Vampire Hunter?</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/417022/files/20140307014424-68e8df329d6f96f4d5c01fe583c9e873_large.png?1394185464"" src="""" style=""""/><br/></p><p><br/></p>

<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">We really want to improve the number of fighters in the game and we would like to do it quickly. Because, truth must be told, a fighting game without enough fighters to select and

<p>If we are lucky and if we go beyond the $27,000 level in our ladder, we will pursue next objectives.

<p>As you’ve seen it in our ladder, we need to raise a minimum of $6,000 to
keep supporting the team, which will be really helpful for us and for Blade
Lords. Of course, if we can manage to have more and go higher in the ladder,
it’s only an awesome bonus. </p>
<p>All mentionned the features are the most important to add to the game
right now. And this is why we are requesting your help with this IndieGoGo
campaign! We cannot keep investing upfront in the game development for now,
unless you help us. </p><p><br/></p>

<p></p>
<p>It’s important for us that you know
how your money will be used. So we decided to be completely transparent with
you. So, voilà, we’re sharing with you our budget split of this project:</p>
<p><b>·<span>

<p><b>·<span>

<p></p>
<p>This
split is quite the same whatever the level of the ladder we achieve. As you can
see the major part of the funds will be used for the production team, whether
it be the developers, the artists, the GD or else.  </p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/426264/files/20140311092033-BladeLordsGame-2012-10-03-16-43-19-37.jpg?1394554833"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p><br/></p>

<p><b><i>Q. Will this new Blade Lords project will be
free or paid?</i></b></p>
<p>A. The actual version of Blade Lords is based on a free-to-play economic
model. And we won’t change this model for the new version. We really want
people to have fun with our game and spend money only if they want to.</p>
<p><b><i>Q. When do I receive my perks?</i></b></p>
<p>A. That depends on the perk and where in the world you are. We are
experiencing some delays in shipping out perks. But of course, we’ll be
updating the campaign page. Basically, you should expect your physical perks
sometime winter 2014. But be sure that if we can do it before, we’ll do
it. </p>
<p><b><i>Q. Can I upgrade my

We focused our efforts on its gaming experience and its fluidity so they can immerse you in an Asian / medieval visual landscape and environment. For now, there are 6 fighters in Blade Lords: Sakuraba - the sword master, Kateryn - the war maiden, Cirtan - the paladin, Hitodama - the demon, Kyogen - the assassin and the last but not the least, the Dark Lord - the pure evil.We started the production two years ago before launching it in January 2013. Our goal was to create a high quality game that reflects our will: get the fighting experience we ever wanted to play on mobile and tablets. Even if we managed to do so, we know it's not enough. Blade Lords is lacking some contents that we want to bring to make it a real and true fighting game.Below you will find all the details about our crowdfunding campaign: our objectives and new ambitions for the new version of Blade Lords, the reasons why we decided to launch such campaign, why we need your help and the rewards you'll get from helping us.We hope you will enjoy it and you will be ready to support us after reading it!



As it is shown on the ladder above, we’d like to bring new content to Blade Lords.
And it will only be possible with this IndieGoGo campaign. The following
explanations detail our first goal and the others goals stretched in time we’d
like to achieve.
Two things in this level: the possibility to play Blade Lords with a
controller and the addition of a completely new fighter.
· 
The controller will
lead the game to another level both for you and for us. On our side, we
will discover a brand new technology we’ll never use before and on your side
you’ll fell like playing Blade Lords on an arcade and/or console. You should
know that for the moment, we don’t really know which controller to choose. The
idea of the MadCatz controller came up, but nothing has been decided yet. We’ll
continue our researches on the domain, but in the meantime, if you have some
tips or envies don’t hesitate to share them with us :)                                     
· 
A completely new fighter
will be added to the game. Then it means a completely new gameplay such as
attacks, combos and Heaven Art as well as new items such as weapons and armors. By the way, if you contribute, you'll be able to choose which new character you'd like to have in the game, between these three :)! Which one will you choose? Balmung the pirate, Kokoro the Geisha or Vlade the Vampire Hunter?

With this level, the local multiplayer will be finally available. Then
you’ll be able to challenge your friends on the same device. 


We really want to improve the number of fighters in the game and we would like to do it quickly. Because, truth must be told, a fighting game without enough fighters to select and
to play with isn’t a true fighting game.  If we manage to achieve this goal, we assure you that the fighters family of Blade Lords will be well improved!
If we are lucky and if we go beyond the $27,000 level in our ladder, we will pursue next objectives. Then, with your help and support, here is what we would like to do:  · The port of Blade Lords on Android· The addition of new fighters· The creation of the synchronous multiplayer· The port of Blade Lords on PC!!

                    
As you’ve seen it in our ladder, we need to raise a minimum of $6,000 to
keep supporting the team, which will be really helpful for us and for Blade
Lords. Of course, if we can manage to have more and go higher in the ladder,
it’s only an awesome bonus. 
All mentionned the features are the most important to add to the game
right now. And this is why we are requesting your help with this IndieGoGo
campaign! We cannot keep investing upfront in the game development for now,
unless you help us. 


It’s important for us that you know
how your money will be used. So we decided to be completely transparent with
you. So, voilà, we’re sharing with you our budget split of this project:
· 
Developers: 45%
· 
Artists: 23%
· 
Game Designers: 7%
· 
QA: 5%
· 
Audio: 3%
· 
Rewards: 10%
· 
IndieGoGo fees: 7% 

This
split is quite the same whatever the level of the ladder we achieve. As you can
see the major part of the funds will be used for the production team, whether
it be the developers, the artists, the GD or else.

</h2>
<h2>Why We Need Your Help</h2>
<h3>Help Us take FLURF, to our local conventions and promote its launch through digital marketing.</h3>
<p>We have gotten to where we are by bootstrapping. With our team’s life savings and the grace of our friends and families, we have built Loreful with zero financial assistance from outside sources. The development of FLURF and two additional Pre-Alphas have been fully funded by us. We find ourselves, on the eve of launching FLURF in need of marketing dollars and We Need Your Help!</p>
<p>While digital distribution has allowed us to control our own fates as indie game developers, that freedom comes at a price. Giving up publishers means we give up the valuable marketing dollars that publishers bring to the table. It’s a common issue in the indie world. We all face it as independent game developers. The answer of course, is YOU. Crowdfunding allows us to look to you, the gamer and the investor, to assist us with the marketing dollars we need to be seen and heard. Without your help we cannot boldly take that step into truly independent game development.</p>
<h2>What is FLURF?</h2>
<p></p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/476374/files/20140401104932-header-piece-flurf.png?1396374572"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>FLURF is an endless platformer for iOS, Android and Windows Phone.</p><p>As the reluctant alien hero FLURF, you must avoid massive monsters across an alien landscape while rescuing your kids. The more obstacles you overcome &amp; the more kids you save — the more points you accrue. Saving “Baby FLURFs” also provides you with valuable GEMS or “FLURFSTONES” that you may use to purchase power-ups and unique maneuvers like the handy DOUBLE JUMP!</p>
<p>It is fun, competitive and addictive gameplay in it’s simplest form.</p>
<p><b>FLURF will be launching on iOS, Android and Windows Phone in May 2014 on the Apple App Store, GooglePlay, Amazon App Store and the Windows Store.</b></p>
<h2>Who We Are?</h2>
<p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/471492/files/20140330133412-title4.png?1396211652"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p></p><p>Founded in 2012 by award-winning creative director, Aharon Cagle — Loreful is a video game development studio located in Cincinnati, Ohio. Loreful produces cross platform video games for iOS, Android, PC, Mac, Linux, Playstation and XBOX.</p>
<p>We are a studio of 10 passionate gamers, dedicated to bringing refreshing new IPs and gameplay experiences to life. Everyone here lives, breathes and dreams about gaming. It is more than just our passion, it’s an obsession founded in a collective belief that video games enrich our lives and ultimately make the world a better place.</p>
<p>While FLURF is only our VERY HUMBLE first step as a studio, we are in Pre-Alpha production on two additional titles — an Action/RTS and a Sci-Fi RPG. To learn more about us and our work, visit us at <a href=""http://www.loreful.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Loreful.com</a>.</p>
<h2>How We Are Using the Funds</h2>
<p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/483854/files/20140404102302-money-use-FLURF.png?1396632182"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p></p><p>The funds raised from this IndieGoGo campaign will be used to secure booth space at the Cincy Comicon, the Cincinnati Comic Expo and to represent Cincinnati game development at the first annual Indy PopCon in Indianapolis. Additionally, the remaining funds will be used for our digital marketing campaign. So quite simply, the more we raise, the better we can market FLURF.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/483856/files/20140404102419-title3.png?1396632259"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p>
<p>Booth space is actually very affordable. But that’s only the beginning of costs that are incurred in attending a convention as a company. You have large format signage, additional badges for employees, swag, electricity (yeah that’s never included), equipment and in the case of out-of-town conventions — hotel rooms, travel expenses and it’s usually a nice thing to feed your employees when they are asked to man booths all weekend. As you can imagine, all of this adds up rather quickly.</p>
<h2>Beyond the Goal</h2>
<p>If we manage to go far above and beyond our goal of $15,000...we'll announce our stretch goals. Since we are deeply committed to FLURF and its growth beyond an endless platformer, you can imagine that we have many ideas for extending the gameplay and property. Our stretch goals will reflect that commitment. </p>
<h2>REWARDS!</h2>

Why We Need Your Help
Help Us take FLURF, to our local conventions and promote its launch through digital marketing.
We have gotten to where we are by bootstrapping. With our team’s life savings and the grace of our friends and families, we have built Loreful with zero financial assistance from outside sources. The development of FLURF and two additional Pre-Alphas have been fully funded by us. We find ourselves, on the eve of launching FLURF in need of marketing dollars and We Need Your Help!
While digital distribution has allowed us to control our own fates as indie game developers, that freedom comes at a price. Giving up publishers means we give up the valuable marketing dollars that publishers bring to the table. It’s a common issue in the indie world. We all face it as independent game developers. The answer of course, is YOU. Crowdfunding allows us to look to you, the gamer and the investor, to assist us with the marketing dollars we need to be seen and heard. Without your help we cannot boldly take that step into truly independent game development.
What is FLURF?
FLURF is an endless platformer for iOS, Android and Windows Phone.As the reluctant alien hero FLURF, you must avoid massive monsters across an alien landscape while rescuing your kids. The more obstacles you overcome & the more kids you save — the more points you accrue. Saving “Baby FLURFs” also provides you with valuable GEMS or “FLURFSTONES” that you may use to purchase power-ups and unique maneuvers like the handy DOUBLE JUMP!
It is fun, competitive and addictive gameplay in it’s simplest form.
FLURF will be launching on iOS, Android and Windows Phone in May 2014 on the Apple App Store, GooglePlay, Amazon App Store and the Windows Store.
Who We Are?
Founded in 2012 by award-winning creative director, Aharon Cagle — Loreful is a video game development studio located in Cincinnati, Ohio. Loreful produces cross platform video games for iOS, Android, PC, Mac, Linux, Playstation and XBOX.
We are a studio of 10 passionate gamers, dedicated to bringing refreshing new IPs and gameplay experiences to life. Everyone here lives, breathes and dreams about gaming. It is more than just our passion, it’s an obsession founded in a collective belief that video games enrich our lives and ultimately make the world a better place.
While FLURF is only our VERY HUMBLE first step as a studio, we are in Pre-Alpha production on two additional titles — an Action/RTS and a Sci-Fi RPG. To learn more about us and our work, visit us at Loreful.com.
How We Are Using the Funds
The funds raised from this IndieGoGo campaign will be used to secure booth space at the Cincy Comicon, the Cincinnati Comic Expo and to represent Cincinnati game development at the first annual Indy PopCon in Indianapolis. Additionally, the remaining funds will be used for our digital marketing campaign. So quite simply, the more we raise, the better we can market FLURF.
Booth space is actually very affordable. But that’s only the beginning of costs that are incurred in attending a convention as a company. You have large format signage, additional badges for employees, swag, electricity (yeah that’s never included), equipment and in the case of out-of-town conventions — hotel rooms, travel expenses and it’s usually a nice thing to feed your employees when they are asked to man booths all weekend. As you can imagine, all of this adds up rather quickly.
Beyond the Goal
If we manage to go far above and beyond our goal of $15,000...we'll announce our stretch goals. Since we are deeply committed to FLURF and its growth beyond an endless platformer, you can imagine that we have many ideas for extending the gameplay and property. Our stretch goals will reflect that commitment.

<p><span style=""font-size: 1.2em;"">This is our vision for the game.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 1.2em;"">Build your homeworld, research new technologies to develop awesome new ships for your fleet, and conquer new territories in space. Lay claim to uninhabitable worlds rich in the resources you need to develop, and fight over the right to mine the best ones.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 1.2em;"">Build alliances of friends. Be social. Work together towards common alliance goals, and help each other out in need. We aim to make the social aspect of AD2460 to be a central part of the game. </span></p>

<p><span style=""font-size: 1.2em;"">When starting this project, we decided that we would reboot the web-strategy genre. We feel it is about time.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 1.2em;""> We would treat the game as a game, not a playable web-site, and we would make it a social place, with a lot of interaction, cooperation and excitement. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 1.2em;"">We would create a game that you could play from any device with a web-browser, without any required plug-ins.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 1.2em;"">We would do away with the endless loading of web-pages, and create a seamless interactive experience, just like any other game.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 1.2em;"">We would design it so that thousands of players could play the game simultaneously on the same server. 80.000 to be exact.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 1.2em;"">And we're almost there.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 1.2em;"">We are very proud of what we have created this far. Our hopes are high that we will bring you a game that not only entertains you, but engages you and does so in a great social setting.</span></p>

<h3><img alt=""Funding Details"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.ad2460.com/images/webgfx/indiegogo/about_funding_header.png"" src="""" style=""""/></h3>
<p><span style=""font-size: 1.2em;"">There's a difference between having a complete product, and almost complete product. It's a huge difference.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 1.2em;"">We're in need of funding for the last part of our production. The part that matters to you. The part where everything is polished, stable and enjoyable when the game is launched. The part that allows you, the gamer, to sit back, smile, enjoy and think: </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-style: italic; font-size: 1.2em;"">""This is so cool!""</span></p>
<h2>Can we pull this off?</h2>
<p><span style=""font-size: 1.2em;"">Fifth Season has been creating and running online persistent games for over a decade, and our current running-game, ManagerLeague, has been online for over 8 years, and has about 50.000 active users from around the globe. The game has been constantly updated, revised and improved upon ever since launch. We've listened to our players and made a huge number of changes that have been requested.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 1.2em;"">Fifth Season also practically invented the sci-fi web-strategy genre when it launched the hugely popular Planetarion in 2001. Most other games in the genre out there, are direct decendants of that particular game.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 1.2em;"">Are we capable? We think so.</span></p>
<h2>What will the money provide?</h2>
<p><span style=""font-size: 1.2em;""><img alt=""Galaxy"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.ad2460.com/images/webgfx/indiegogo/galaxyside.png"" src="""" style=""float: right; margin-left: 20px; margin-bottom: 10px;""/>The money will give us the time and resources to do the final stages of production in a proper manner. Too many games launch with too many problems. Often they are not as fun as they were intended mainly because of this.

Although we did not reach our goal, we would still like to thank all our contributors. Your support is neither in vain or wasted. We are still working on the game, and beta announcements will be sent to everyone once we are ready to open our servers.

Please keep following us on facebook for more updates.

UPDATE:
Initial pitch video has been moved to the gallery section!



You control your own homeworld in a persistent online science fiction strategy game. You can log in and control every aspect of your civilization from any platform that has a web-browser. You can team up with friends from all over the world and fight for power in the universe.
This is our vision for the game.
Build your homeworld, research new technologies to develop awesome new ships for your fleet, and conquer new territories in space. Lay claim to uninhabitable worlds rich in the resources you need to develop, and fight over the right to mine the best ones.
Build alliances of friends. Be social. Work together towards common alliance goals, and help each other out in need. We aim to make the social aspect of AD2460 to be a central part of the game. 
We want you to feel the excitement of the conquest, the enjoyment of the collaboration, and the intensity of the conflict!
We would like you to be a part of our universe. A universe accessible anywhere and filled with real people. You can help us make it a reality.
You can play any way you like, and still have fun. Play a little or play a lot, the challenges are there for everyone. You can even play for free!
Science fiction strategy has never looked like this on the web!

Although we would have liked to give you a complete rundown of the mechanics of the game and every aspect of being a player in our game-universe, we realize that those of you who would like to support our production, will want to know more about AD2460 than we can comfortably fit into this presentation.
 So, if you would like to know more about the game right away, go to: http://www.ad2460.com/There you can find images, videos and a wealth of information on all aspects of the game. Enjoy.

When starting this project, we decided that we would reboot the web-strategy genre. We feel it is about time.
 We would treat the game as a game, not a playable web-site, and we would make it a social place, with a lot of interaction, cooperation and excitement. 
We would create a game that you could play from any device with a web-browser, without any required plug-ins.
We would do away with the endless loading of web-pages, and create a seamless interactive experience, just like any other game.
We would design it so that thousands of players could play the game simultaneously on the same server. 80.000 to be exact.
And we're almost there.
We are very proud of what we have created this far. Our hopes are high that we will bring you a game that not only entertains you, but engages you and does so in a great social setting.
You can help us reach the finish line and launch the game! Contribute today, and reap the rewards within the game at launch. 
Check out the perks in the following section to see how we will reward the faith you have in us delivering a fresh new game experience!

This is the main user-interface. From here, you can control every aspect of the game.
 




There's a difference between having a complete product, and almost complete product. It's a huge difference.
We're in need of funding for the last part of our production. The part that matters to you. The part where everything is polished, stable and enjoyable when the game is launched. The part that allows you, the gamer, to sit back, smile, enjoy and think: 
""This is so cool!""
Can we pull this off?
Fifth Season has been creating and running online persistent games for over a decade, and our current running-game, ManagerLeague, has been online for over 8 years, and has about 50.000 active users from around the globe. The game has been constantly updated, revised and improved upon ever since launch. We've listened to our players and made a huge number of changes that have been requested.
Fifth Season also practically invented the sci-fi web-strategy genre when it launched the hugely popular Planetarion in 2001. Most other games in the genre out there, are direct decendants of that particular game.
Are we capable? We think so.
What will the money provide?
The money will give us the time and resources to do the final stages of production in a proper manner. Too many games launch with too many problems. Often they are not as fun as they were intended mainly because of this. We hope that we can make good use of the money to secure our product and give everyone the great game we intend it to be. From day one.
We also want to make sure that the game works optimally on as many devices as possible. Since the web-platform is not uniform, cross-browser, and cross-device testing will be essential in getting everything to be trouble free for our players.
Graphics are costly, and people do not and should not work for free. We like good graphics, and aim to get as much of it as possible into the game.
We need $150.000 to do all this. Help us reach our goal, and launch a game that likely will keep you entertained for years. We mean that. We've currently got players in our other online web-game who were with us during the beta-testing 8 years ago. We're here for the long-haul.
For our funders, we will provide the following (some are contribution-dependant):
- Exclusive access to a funder-only beta testing sessions.
- In-game currency. Although the game is free to play, there are some things that will require you to spend small amounts of money to gain access to. They will now be available for you to buy from the get-go.
- Exclusive homeworld graphics. Some perks will get you a special code to unock a special look for your homeworld. Everyone in the game will see that you contributed to the release of the game.
- Contribute enough, and we will allow you to name one of the ship-types in the game.
- Signed posters are also available to select contributors.
- It is also possible to get your face in the game!
 
What if we don't reach our funding goal?
Don't worry. We have no plans to give up on this game. It will be launched upon the web. We may need more time, or we may have to cut some features, but we will get there. We do hope we reach our goal, as it would make the process of releasing the game a lot easier.
We do hope you decide to contribute.

is something new. 
The 'Bounce' idea stems from the need for simple yet addictive 'pick-up-and-play' game-play with that 'just one more go' factor added in. You control a bouncing ball and all you need to do is avoid falling into oblivion.This is achieved by clicking on colored platforms which spawn on the screen .. sound simple ?? .. think again.The longer you survive the more varied the colored tiles become , with each different color changing the game-play in someway.For example landing on a red tile does nothing , but landing on a blue tile will rotate the game , while yellow will spawn many more tiles and green will speed everything up.As your score increases to specific levels , the backgrounds will change and strange 'Easter-egg' objects will float across the background.For example , achieving a score of 100 may cause a chair to float across , at 200 there may be a spaceship .. at 2000 there may be a teddy bear ..These will always be the same at each score level as well as a score level name .. these will allow you to brag to your friends .. 'Have you seen the teddy bear yet at the Shadow level ?? .. didn't think so' ______________________________________________________________Current Platform List- Standard 1 bounce then fall- Multi-Bounce before fall- Moving Pattern (3 dimensional)- Disappear after time- Low Bounce- High Bounce- Slow Bounce- Fast Bounce- Map Direction Scroll Change- Speed up scroll- Slow down scroll- Flip (2 different Types of the above , randomly changing)- Dice (6 different Types of the above , randomly changing)_______________________________________________________________ The game development is currently underway using the Unity3D development system and is hopefully due for completion during May 2014.https://unity3d.com/This is our first project using the Unity3D development tools.

<h3>The Basics</h3>
<p>We all remember the classics on the NES, but sadly many of the games of that era are either hard to find, too expensive or simply don't work properly with modern TVs.  With the wonders of computers it is possible to relive these games using emulators and hacked ROMs, this however isn't exactly legal.  With Lair of Dread we hope to capture the spirit of those games and add some flair to the classic 2d platformer genre.</p>
<p><img alt=""Jumping"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/783379/pictures/full/20130429190151-New_capture.PNG?1367287315"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>What's a PorkTruck?</strong></h3>
<p>Porktruck Games is the name our group has taken to calling ourselves.  This will be our first commercially released game, and it's a labor of love, but you are probably wondering who we are.</p>
<p><strong>PorkTruck Games Team members:</strong></p>
<p>Justin Wilson - Developer</p>
<p>Dan Fisette - Art</p>
<p>Joe Peterson - Music</p>
<p>Jae Wilson - Writer</p>
<h3>The story</h3>
<p>You are an assassin, a member of an elite group called the black cloaks. You're hired to kill the Prince of a neighboring principality.  Things are not as they seem when the plan goes awry the black cloak must venture to confront the ones who sent him, or return to the order in failure, a most certain death.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>How it is</h3>
<p>I'll put it simply, with this successfull campaign, the team at PorkTruck Games will be able to put more time, energy and love into the game making it all the better.  I would like to develop the game full time to its completion and with your help I can do that.  With any level of support, you'll receive the game in its entirety, however those who contribute more will receive special perks such as their name in the credits or even characters named after them in game.</p>
<p>As it stands right now, the mechanics of the game are complete, the ability to run, jump, attack, and complete levels are already implemented.  With more time and a little help we can improve the look of the game and extend it more more levels, environments and music.</p>
<p><img alt=""Cost Breakdown"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/787625/pictures/full/20130501204838-Breakdown-Where_it_goes.png?1367466523"" src="""" style="""" title=""Breakdown-Where it goes""/></p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Why is it different?</h3>
<p>I know there are lots of Indie games and Indie game developers hoping for support to get their games off the ground, but I believe Lair of Dread can breathe new life into the 2d platformer genre.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you're unable to help contribute, that's okay I'm glad you came to check out the game.  If you are still looking to find some way to help, why not share this page on Facebook, Twitter, or any other social medium.  Anything you can do will go a long way in making the game better.</p>

</div></div>","The Basics
We all remember the classics on the NES, but sadly many of the games of that era are either hard to find, too expensive or simply don't work properly with modern TVs.  With the wonders of computers it is possible to relive these games using emulators and hacked ROMs, this however isn't exactly legal.  With Lair of Dread we hope to capture the spirit of those games and add some flair to the classic 2d platformer genre.

 
What's a PorkTruck?
Porktruck Games is the name our group has taken to calling ourselves.  This will be our first commercially released game, and it's a labor of love, but you are probably wondering who we are.
PorkTruck Games Team members:
Justin Wilson - Developer
Dan Fisette - Art
Joe Peterson - Music
Jae Wilson - Writer
The story
You are an assassin, a member of an elite group called the black cloaks. You're hired to kill the Prince of a neighboring principality.  Things are not as they seem when the plan goes awry the black cloak must venture to confront the ones who sent him, or return to the order in failure, a most certain death.


How it is
I'll put it simply, with this successfull campaign, the team at PorkTruck Games will be able to put more time, energy and love into the game making it all the better.  I would like to develop the game full time to its completion and with your help I can do that.  With any level of support, you'll receive the game in its entirety, however those who contribute more will receive special perks such as their name in the credits or even characters named after them in game.
As it stands right now, the mechanics of the game are complete, the ability to run, jump, attack, and complete levels are already implemented.  With more time and a little help we can improve the look of the game and extend it more more levels, environments and music.

 


Why is it different?
I know there are lots of Indie games and Indie game developers hoping for support to get their games off the ground, but I believe Lair of Dread can breathe new life into the 2d platformer genre.


Other Ways You Can Help
If you're unable to help contribute, that's okay I'm glad you came to check out the game.  If you are still looking to find some way to help, why not share this page on Facebook, Twitter, or any other social medium.  Anything you can do will go a long way in making the game better.
Still curious?

<p>You are simple fisherman, not a hero, not even a warrior, just a plain and simple fisherman. After returning from a long fishing trip, the island surprises you with a deadly silence, no one seems to be around. In fact everyone is missing, your family, friends, even the animals seem to be gone. You find a dead body, its Billy the farmer, he seems to have written a letter before dying. He describes a thing.... a horror he went through before his final moments. Its your duty as a father to find your family, you decide to explore the island in the search for an answer. </p>

<p></p>Making a game is expensive just by taking into account software licensing and the hardware required. But when you add sound desing and music composition into the equation it gets really expensive. I am running this indiegogo campaing as flexible funding for 2 things. 1 I know that not everyone has a paypal account and 2, this game is getting done even if we do not meet our goal. BUT if we do meet our funding goal we will be able to work with sound designers and deliver a better game.</span><p></p>
