<p><b>About the Steps Ahead Summer Dance Intensive</b></p>
<p>As native of Miami, I
wanted to do something very special to bring all the knowledge I’ve acquired
over the years to my hometown. Out of this desire came the Steps Ahead Summer
Dance Intensive. This is a two-day intensive in which students train in a
variety of dance techniques in master classes taught by seasoned industry
professionals, most of whom are also Miami natives. We're offering Ballet, Contemporary, Commercial Hip-Hop, Broadway Jazz, as well as Choreography and Moving on Purpose workshops. The intensive will culminate
with the Steps Ahead industry seminar which covers the key components of
working in the dance industry. This includes audition preparation, headshots,
resume formatting, dealing with criticism, navigating time in between jobs, caring for your instrument(body), and marketing
yourself effectively. <br/></p>
<p>We all know that being a working artist isn't easy! But the smarter you 
are in your approach, the more successful you'll be. Preparation for the
 professional world is imperative for young artists. Very often I find 
that dancers are very well trained and excellent technicians however 
they lack many of the other tools necessary for life as a professional. 
My team and I would love to help bridge that gap and this intensive is a
 start. This will help dancers become sharp, confident, and in full 
understanding of what it takes to be a success. <br/></p>
<p>The
Steps Ahead programs are designed specifically for emerging professional
dancers ages 16 and above. We aide dancers by
preparing them to enter the market as well informed, business-minded artists.</p>

Lynn is a proud native of Miami, FL, and high school graduate of New World
School of the Arts, where she trained in all forms of dance. During her time at
New World, she received a number of scholarships to attend the Alvin Ailey
summer intensive and was eventually asked to join the 2nd company, Ailey II.
She then went on to attend Florida State University and finished with two

<p></p>
<p><b>About the Choreographer:</b><br/></p>Kristen Demaree, grew up in a home that placed art as a medium for
living.  She developed musical sensibilities from her father Dan Demaree
(a talented jazz and classical musician), and dance sensibilities from
her mother Barbara Demaree, whose training in the Royal Academy of
Dance gave rise to Boulder’s first ballet culture as co-founder of both Boulder
Ballet in 1982, and her dance school Ballet Arts Boulder.  As a dancer, Kristen grew up dancing in Boulder and performed with the Boulder Ballet in its early years.  As a violinist,
Kristen was immersed and trained in the techniques and idioms of both folk and
classical forms of music, and is still part of the music community in Boulder performing
violin in gypsy jazz ensembles, Scandinavian folk music ensembles, and classical orchestras.<br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1438130798/qaytgouaffdr9ywst6ud.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 100.456px; height: 138px;""/></p>
<span>She is currently  on the faculty of Boulder Ballet
and Longmont Dance Theater, where she teaches ballet, folk dance, and
improvisation.  In addition to her position as a ballet
instructor, over the last 2 decades her artistic palette has been continually
developing and expanding, drawing on past experiences, and by asking new
questions.  Before completing her MFA
in dance at the University of Colorado in 2015, Kristen received her BFA in
Film Studies, studying experimental film with Stan Brakhage and Phil
Solomon.  While studying film, music, dance
and design, Kristen has been deeply influenced by her mentors: </span><span>Frances Charteris,</span><span></span><span> Nad</span><span>a Diachenko, Michelle
Ellsworth,  Robin Haig, Rennie Harris, Markas Henry, Erika Randall, and
last but not least, her mother Barbara Demaree. As co-founder and co-director
of Delusions of Grandeur Productions, she developed three shows over the last decade,
the most recent of which (“Eternal Dialogue”) had a cast of no less than 30
musicians and dancers.</span>
<p><b>About the Ballet: </b><br/>
Derived from the second act of ""Giselle"", this work stems from a love of ballet, feminist theory, women's history during
the French Revolution, and performance art.<span> 
""Strange Bird and the Cloud Spirits"" re-imagines the birth of
the ballerina as a product of revolutionary change.  This ballet is centered around the empowering
ideas that gave rise to ballet and the romantic form known as “ballet fantastique”.  “Ballet fantastique” was a development of dance that dealt
with the aftermath of the atrocities of the French Revolution.  The stories related to the common people, and had an element of fascination with the supernatural. 
This was a time that many believe was the birth of modern western society.  Our experiences of living today, we are dealing with certain repercussions of those
ideas: environmentalism, capitalism, human rights, and freedom.  Drawing ideas from the romantic era might seem like a nostalgic or outdated approach, yet people's concerns and struggles for equality and freedom at the time of the French revolution are still valid concerns for people all around the world today.  The balletic gestures, the romantic tutu, and
the transition in women taking over the stage from the male aristocrat were meaningful symbols and events that embodied the society's change in values.</span></p>
<p>This ballet was created in remembrance of that era
-- not only as a retelling of history, but as tool to redefine and re-perceive the modern
ballerina.<span>  Ballet's modern affinity for extreme athleticism and sensationalism can have a tendency to marginalize both the artistry and the societal meta-messages which a ballet's story was the vehicle to transmit.  The beauty and value in the art is at odds with the power structures, administration, and marketing ploys of a ballet company, which have
become a singular voice dictating much of the future of ballet.  This work involves dancers from professional to novice abilities, of various ages, and encourages embodying ballet in a different way than that of the mainstream.  The limitless possibilities and meanings beyond
tricks and kicks are what this ballet brings to the foreground.<br/><br/>Additionally, the Strange Bird ballet uses music that is not in the standard classical dance repertoire.  The performance is set to an album by Dreamers' Circus called ""A Little Symphony,"" whose musicians won 3 of the top awards at the 2013 Danish Music Awards (Danish ""Grammy""): Folk Talent of the Year, Folk Album of the Year, and Folk Artist of the Year to Nordic mandola player Ale Carr.  What makes the album unique (and perfect for Kristen's music and dance sensibilities) is its breathless integration of folk music's nature expanded and mixed with an orchestra.  With the music both classical and folk-sounding, the resulting sound is well-fitting to ballet, and encourages a broadening and integration of other influences.</span></p>
<b>About the Campaign:</b><br/>
This campaign is to raise funds to produce this ballet again to be performed at
the Dairy Center on October 16, 17  and October 23, 24.  <br/>
<br/>
Ideally, a budget of $15,000  would allow for paid directors, professional
dancers, performance and rehearsal space, lighting design, set design and
construction, costume, make-up and hair designers.   Paying for work means
paying for the amount of time and energy that it takes to bring out the best in
everyone.  However, a bare-bones budget of $5000 would secure the
performance and rehearsal space, which would allow for the production to occur,
and everyone's time would be in-kind.  The campaign is set to $5000 is because that is what is needed to get the show on the road: $5000 will go to rent
performance and rehearsal space (which equates to roughly half of that amount), as well as for technical staff, lighting
design, and costumes.   Anything over and
beyond will allow for further support of all the artists involved.<br/>

and Elvira Stewart in 2005.  Delusions' shows have always been well-attended and have received grants from
the Boulder County Arts Alliance for past productions.  Elvira
will be creating new work for performances as well.  Her artistry stems from experience with Maurice Béjart in
Switzerland, where she focused on ballet from the perspective of the male
dancer rather than the ballerina.   Elvira's component will encompass her love for partnering and pas de duex, as well as a male
solo performance.  Both of these works together seek to redefine, reconstruct, and redeem ballet
and its dancers in a way that both honors and transforms the tradition.  Previous Delusions of Grandeur productions include:<br/><ol>

</p>
<p>In <b>ENTANGLED,
</b>as in life, our darkest secrets always find their way to the light.
Sometimes this light disarms them, diffusing their potency. And sometimes the
light catches the cracks and the dirty corners, breathing life back into those
dormant memories. And no matter how much we try to rewrite history, the truth
always finds a way to muscle through the lies. Two best friends, Ian and Scott
along with Hillary, the woman Ian loves, find themselves trapped in an
impossible predicament: un-knowing what they know. And so, on a stormy new
year’s eve on the secluded Peaks Island in Maine, our characters find
themselves trapped by the snow and the avalanche of horrible realities they’ve
been trying to hide from one another over the years. Everyone’s secrets are
revealed. No one is safe from blame. And someone will not make it off the
island alive.</p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need To Make It Happen!</h3> <p>In order to produce the play in it's highest quality, we have assembled a team of graduates from Carnegie Mellon University, NYU Tisch, and Yale School of Drama. As is the life of an artist, it is always difficult to make ends meet, and we would like to be able to fund the design fully so that we can pay the creatives and actors the money that they deserve. This team is INCREDIBLE. These artists are dedicated and extremely talented. This story will haunt you for weeks and months to come. </p>
<p>We aim to raise $6,000 to go towards the costs of this production. Without you, this production would not be possible. </p>
<p>We will repay you in gratitude, love, and recognition in the publicity. We have a bunch of nice sponsorship options on the side. We'd love for you to take a look! </p>
<p>All of the money raised here will go directly to the funding the creation of this new production. Please feel free to spread the word! We would be grateful for any and all support. </p>

</div></div>","About The Play 

In ENTANGLED,
as in life, our darkest secrets always find their way to the light.
Sometimes this light disarms them, diffusing their potency. And sometimes the
light catches the cracks and the dirty corners, breathing life back into those
dormant memories. And no matter how much we try to rewrite history, the truth
always finds a way to muscle through the lies. Two best friends, Ian and Scott
along with Hillary, the woman Ian loves, find themselves trapped in an
impossible predicament: un-knowing what they know. And so, on a stormy new
year’s eve on the secluded Peaks Island in Maine, our characters find
themselves trapped by the snow and the avalanche of horrible realities they’ve
been trying to hide from one another over the years. Everyone’s secrets are
revealed. No one is safe from blame. And someone will not make it off the
island alive.   What We Need To Make It Happen! In order to produce the play in it's highest quality, we have assembled a team of graduates from Carnegie Mellon University, NYU Tisch, and Yale School of Drama. As is the life of an artist, it is always difficult to make ends meet, and we would like to be able to fund the design fully so that we can pay the creatives and actors the money that they deserve. This team is INCREDIBLE. These artists are dedicated and extremely talented. This story will haunt you for weeks and months to come. 
We aim to raise $6,000 to go towards the costs of this production. Without you, this production would not be possible. 
We will repay you in gratitude, love, and recognition in the publicity. We have a bunch of nice sponsorship options on the side. We'd love for you to take a look! 
All of the money raised here will go directly to the funding the creation of this new production. Please feel free to spread the word! We would be grateful for any and all support.

This is my very first time doing anything like this and I'm excited to share with you what I've been cooking up! 
It is my sincerest hope to support the artists that are making my dreams come true with their hard-work, inkling for mentor-ship, desire to collaborate with emerging artists and passion for the subject matter of this play. I'm beyond grateful for their time and efforts and would like to support them as well as cover production cost for prop and set needs. 
Short Summary 
Black Bitch is a bold and exciting new work developed by actress, poet and emcee ShaVunda Horsley and directed by Shá Cage, writer and performer of , U/G/L/Y, Nword and co-founder of the Minnesota Spoken Word Association and Mama Mosaic Theater. Blending monologues, spoken word, film clips, music and and more, this deep-hitting yet comedic one-woman show explores the tools that black women use to access power, and their responses to social and political spaces carved “for us,” versus “by us.

I was inspired to create this work as a conversation piece between Mentors I've been blessed to have and young women struggling to find their voices amidst the chaos of social media, cultural identity conflicts and understanding power.
 Your support makes this possible.

Aspiring actress Molly has been chewed up and spit out by showbiz too many times to count. But when she is denied a callback by snooty director Ashford, something inside of her just...snaps. Molly kidnaps Ashford and holds him hostage in an abandoned theater, subjecting him to bouts of physical, mental, and emotional torture in a crazed bid for the part. Hey, how far would <i>you</i> go for the life you think you deserve?<br/><br/>After that is <strong><u>Slaughterhouse</u></strong>, which is exactly as fun as it sounds. Kurt is a nervous wreck about his new relationship with beautiful, fun-loving Caroline. His self-conscious is compounded by the fact that, oh yeah, he lives in an apartment with three notorious serial killers! They all mistakenly believe <i>him</i> to be one as well, and Kurt would much rather not find out what happens if his roomies discover the truth. But when sweet Caroline pops by for a surprise visit, all hell (and then some) threatens to break lose. However, nothing is ever as it seems...especially in matters of the heart.<br/><br/>Two hilarious (and frightening) plays for the price of one? Who <i>wouldn't</i> want to throw a little money our way? Especially when you--the theoretical producer--take into account that beyond simple giggles and scares, <strong><u>Bloody Awful</u></strong> touches on timely, feminist themes of gender inequality and society's patriarchal structure. </p>

<li>
<strong>$250</strong> for stage management services, to cover our five performances and tech. </li>
</ul>
<p>That comes to a grand total of <strong>$1,400</strong>, a percentage of which has already been paid in advance to the venue. Other costs (props, costumes, set, promotion, etc.) will hopefully be covered by our ticket sales -- though of course, if we go <i>over</i> funding here, your generosity will contribute to these other essential costs, plus marketing. With your support, we won't have to worry about whether or not our team will be going into debt trying to make <strong><u>Bloody Awful</u></strong> a reality. </p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Sides is a show dedicated to the universality of love, family, and friendship. 8 professional musical theatre performers will play multiple characters and share the stories written and composed by Matthew Capurro. Musical director, Jeffrey Michael Kauffman, will lend to the work his trained eye and skills as a pianist as he guides performers through the music and accompanies each performance. It is important to us that these artists receive proper compensation for their time and dedication to the work. </p>

</div></div>","Short Summary
Sides is a show dedicated to the universality of love, family, and friendship. 8 professional musical theatre performers will play multiple characters and share the stories written and composed by Matthew Capurro. Musical director, Jeffrey Michael Kauffman, will lend to the work his trained eye and skills as a pianist as he guides performers through the music and accompanies each performance. It is important to us that these artists receive proper compensation for their time and dedication to the work.

<h2><u>Welcome to <i>The Welcome Revolution</i>'s crowdfunding page!</u></h2>
<p> </p>
<p><strong><i>The Welcome Revolution</i> was born because we want to make the UK a more welcoming place</strong>; it is a retaliation to the negative attitudes towards migration; it celebrates diversity and multiculturalism; and hopes to inspires change. It exists because we believe small acts of kindness do make a difference.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Who are Feat.Theatre?</h3> <p>This show is <strong>about communities, made with communities and by communities</strong>. As a company, we are passionate about presenting diverse voices and experiences on stage, especially those often excluded from theatre. We create work that can be performed in almost every space, and find ways of telling stories that include everyone. We are constantly attempting social and political feats through performance (<strong>like starting revolutions to make the world a kinder place</strong>).</p>
<p><br/>Our first show won multiple awards at the National Student Drama Festival in 2017 (<strong>The Stage UK Directors Award </strong>and the<strong> Camden People’s Theatre Award</strong>). Since then we’ve been developing <i>The Welcome Revolution</i>, which is our first show we’ll be taking up to the Edinburgh Fringe.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>What is <i>The Welcome Revolution</i>?</h3> <p>We hosted many tea parties around the country, <strong>talking to people about their opinions and experiences of welcome and community</strong>. And most importantly, it gave us an opportunity to meet new people and spread kindness. <i>The Welcome Revolution</i> tells their stories, with humour, chocolate biscuits, the help of the audience, and includes the messy but refreshing honesty that voices of children can bring. It also tells the story of a woman who wants to make the world a better place. The show includes real-life responses from community events we have hosted and features new content every performance. But one thing stays the same - <strong>it will bring people together, and inspire people to make a change and join our revolution.</strong></p> <p><strong>Kind things audience members have said about the show so far…</strong></p> <p style=""text-align: center;"">“Left <i>The Welcome Revolution</i> with a huge smile on my face and lots to think about. Beautiful show.”</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>

However, this amazing opportunity comes at a huge cost.</p> <p>As a young company that is concerned with community engagement and outreach, we are relying on our own company funds as well as the generosity of others to help us get to Edinburgh. <strong>We wouldn't be doing this if we didn't think it was worth it!</strong></p> <p>Therefore, we are asking your help to raise £1500, which will help us massively towards our overall cost of the show.</p> <h3>Where will the money go?</h3> <h3><strong>Community</strong></h3> <p><strong>Our community engagement events are vital for the existence of <i>The Welcome Revolution</i></strong>.  They are always free to anyone who attends, and we want to be as generous as possible with tea, coffee and arts &amp; crafts. Of course, this comes at a price and your contributions will be going to a great cause.</p> <h3>Marketing</h3> <p>A lot of the money raised will be going towards making sure that as many people know about <i>The Welcome Revolution</i> as possible.

It is a huge cost for us to sustain this over the month long run at the fringe.</p> <h3>Venue</h3> <p>With help from our funding campaigns and work-in-progress sharings earlier this year, we have been able to cover most of the venue hire cost.

has given thousands of children the gift of the performing arts.   </p>
<p>Twelve or so years ago, I was in
Cheryl’s <i>Mother Jones and the March of
the Mill Children</i>.  The story follows
legendary Mary Harris “Mother Jones” and a group of ragged mill-children as
they march for human dignity and to end child labor.  The show’s universal theme of hope and standing up for what you
believe in has stayed with me all of these years.  As I grew older, continuing to perform in countless shows at
different theaters throughout high school, college and post-graduation, I would
constantly think about just how special <i>Mother
Jones and the March of the Mill Children </i>was, and I made it my goal to
bring this show to a wider audience. </p>
<p>This
past fall, I contacted Cheryl with the idea of reworking her show for a broader
audience—an enormous task involving drastic changes that focus the story and
its central characters.  Cheryl was
up for the challenge, and before we knew it, I was directing a cast of Broadway
performers that fell just as in love with the piece as I had, with two
successful presentations that got us to a very special next step. </p><p></p><p>Perhaps one of the proudest moments of my career thus far was receiving the phone call that the prestigious New York Musical Festival had selected <i>Mother Jones and the Children’s Crusade </i>to be a part of their summer 2014 festival as a Next Link selection, one of ten hand-selected scripts by a committee of some of the most important and influential individuals in the industry- ranging from Tony nominated actors, directors, and writers to world-renowned regional theater Artistic Directors. </p><p>The limitless opportunities and exposure this festival will bring to the show is something so vital to the show’s future life.

<p>Help Dimensions Celebrate 40 Years  of Dance and Community!</p>
<p><span>Dimensions Dance Theater </span>is
 a dance company and school that serves as a beacon of creativity and a 
model of artistic excellence for a low-income, inner city, urban 
community with little access to the arts.  Our audience totals 10,000 
per year: 70% comes from Oakland; 65% are African American; and 80% are 
low-income.</p>
<p><span>On October 5, 2013, Dimensions will present <i>The 40<sup>th</sup> Anniversary</i> <i>Celebration</i>, an evening-length retrospective of four decades of great African and African-derived choreography, </span><span>including the full premiere of <i>Down the Congo Line, </i>a
 work that explores the huge influence of Congolese culture in the 
living traditions of Brazil, Cuba, and New Orleans.  These dances will 
knock your socks off!</span></p>
<p><i>Celebration 40</i> will be presented at <span>Yerba Buena Center for the Arts in San Francisco and will mark
 a momentous occasion in our company’s history, affirming and 
acknowledging the huge contribution that Dimensions has made to the 
cultural life of the Bay Area, as the company looks forward to our next 
phase of artistic creativity and activism.  </span></p>
<p>But we need your help!  To ensure the success of this great celebration, <span>we </span><span>must </span><span>raise
  $15,000 to cover the cost of the production at YBCA.  Your 
contribution will go toward artist fees for more than 30 professional 
Bay Area artists who will be performing that night – and the show can’t 
go on without them! Every dollar counts.  Please know that if we do not raise the entire amount, funds raised will still go to support the artists for this event. If we exceed our goal, which we hope to do, those additional funds will support the expansion of our programs in our 5th decade.<br/></span></p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>DANIEL FETECUA SOTO, a native of Bogotá, Colombia, holds a BFA from Folkwang-Hochschule, Germany, and has appeared as a guest artist in Pina Bausch’s masterpieces, Rite of Spring and Tannhaeuser. He became a member of the LIMON DANCE COMPANY in 2006 and he's currently a soloist with the company. <br/>In 2003 he founded Pajarillo Pinta’o, a dance company that combines Colombian traditional dances and modern dance, that is now based in New York and Germany. <br/>He is currently guest choreographer and board member of ID Studio Theater, a not-for-profit organization led by German Jaramillo. In Spring 2008, he was commissioned to create a new piece by Dancing in the Streets with funding from Harlem Stage and in 2010 he was awarded another grant from Harlem Stage for a new group work. <br/>In 2012 Daniel very proudly received his first grant from NALAC (National Association of Latino Arts and Culture) for the creation of BELLA VISTA, a new dance work dedicated to commemorate the massacre of 2002, of Bella Vista, Bojaya, in the Pacific Region of Colombia.</p>
<p>The Bella Vista Project is meant to be a week of events in NYC in commemoration of the 10th anniversary from the massacre of Bella Vista, Bojaya, in the Pacific Coast of Colombia. </p>
<p>After 3 years of research,  study, and creation process, we have received a partial grant from the National Association of Latino Arts and Culture and we have found a presenting partner, the Flushing Town Hall, in NYC where we will be premiering this nw dance work on October 3rd and 7th. <a href=""http://www.flushingtownhall.org/events/event.php?id=935"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.flushingtownhall.org/events/event.php?id=935</a></p>

<p> <span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-size: 12px; font-weight: bold;"">What We Need &amp; What You Get</span></p>
</div>
<div>
<p>To complete the project and to be able to pay for all the production expenses we need to raise more money.</p>
<p>The project includes live performances, with live music and an original score composed by Sebastian Cruz; but also workshops, conferences , talk backs and Q&amp;A with Lubin Valencia, a direct victim and a survivor of Bojaya and with Camila Orjuela, a social worker of the Natonal University of Colombia. We have to pay for their travels and housing for the weeek they will spend wit us, sharing their stories with our audience, teaching dance workshops and moderationg conferences.</p>
<p>We need your help to pay for the technical expenses, costumes and the expenses for our two guests coming form Colombia: their housing, per-diems, plane tickets and us-visas fees. Their presence is vital for this project.</p>
<p>Bella Vista is a unique project that involves exceptional dancers and top musicians.</p>
<p>WHILE HELPING US YOU CAN GET AMAZING REWARDS: We brought back some amazing art crafts from our last trip to Colombia that you will be receiving as soon as you make your donation!! </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>WE HOPE TO BE ABLE TO LET MORE AND MORE PEOPLE KNOW ABOUT THE TRAGIC HAPPENING IN BELLA VISTA, BOJAYA, IN HOPE THAT THIS WILL BE OPENING SPACE FOR A CHANGE. THE PROBLEM ABOUT THE WAR IN COLOMBIA IS THAT PEOPLE NOT INVOLVED IN IT DON'T REALLY KNOW ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS. MEDIA DON'T TALK ABOUT IT AND THERE IS NO SPACE FOR A  REAL DIALOGUE. </p>
<p>ALSO, WE WISH TO SHARE INFORMATION AND TO LET PEOPLE KNOW ABOUT THE AFRO-COLOMBIAN CULTURE OF THE PACIFIC COAST OF COLOMBIA, THEIR HISTORY, THEIR DANCE, MUSIC and TRADITIONS.</p>

In Spring 2008, he was commissioned to create a new piece by Dancing in the Streets with funding from Harlem Stage and in 2010 he was awarded another grant from Harlem Stage for a new group work. In 2012 Daniel very proudly received his first grant from NALAC (National Association of Latino Arts and Culture) for the creation of BELLA VISTA, a new dance work dedicated to commemorate the massacre of 2002, of Bella Vista, Bojaya, in the Pacific Region of Colombia.
The Bella Vista Project is meant to be a week of events in NYC in commemoration of the 10th anniversary from the massacre of Bella Vista, Bojaya, in the Pacific Coast of Colombia. 
After 3 years of research,  study, and creation process, we have received a partial grant from the National Association of Latino Arts and Culture and we have found a presenting partner, the Flushing Town Hall, in NYC where we will be premiering this nw dance work on October 3rd and 7th. http://www.flushingtownhall.org/events/event.php?id=935
 
 What We Need & What You Get


To complete the project and to be able to pay for all the production expenses we need to raise more money.
The project includes live performances, with live music and an original score composed by Sebastian Cruz; but also workshops, conferences , talk backs and Q&A with Lubin Valencia, a direct victim and a survivor of Bojaya and with Camila Orjuela, a social worker of the Natonal University of Colombia. We have to pay for their travels and housing for the weeek they will spend wit us, sharing their stories with our audience, teaching dance workshops and moderationg conferences.
We need your help to pay for the technical expenses, costumes and the expenses for our two guests coming form Colombia: their housing, per-diems, plane tickets and us-visas fees. Their presence is vital for this project.
Bella Vista is a unique project that involves exceptional dancers and top musicians.
WHILE HELPING US YOU CAN GET AMAZING REWARDS: We brought back some amazing art crafts from our last trip to Colombia that you will be receiving as soon as you make your donation!! 


The Impact
WE HOPE TO BE ABLE TO LET MORE AND MORE PEOPLE KNOW ABOUT THE TRAGIC HAPPENING IN BELLA VISTA, BOJAYA, IN HOPE THAT THIS WILL BE OPENING SPACE FOR A CHANGE. THE PROBLEM ABOUT THE WAR IN COLOMBIA IS THAT PEOPLE NOT INVOLVED IN IT DON'T REALLY KNOW ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS. MEDIA DON'T TALK ABOUT IT AND THERE IS NO SPACE FOR A  REAL DIALOGUE. 
ALSO, WE WISH TO SHARE INFORMATION AND TO LET PEOPLE KNOW ABOUT THE AFRO-COLOMBIAN CULTURE OF THE PACIFIC COAST OF COLOMBIA, THEIR HISTORY, THEIR DANCE, MUSIC and TRADITIONS.

<h3>What/Who are the Near Misses?</h3>
<p>You're probably asking yourself ""Okay, but are you a band? Or an opera?"" We're both.</p>
<p>The Near Misses is an opera manifesting as an all-female electropop band. The show will feature original music, text and choreography inspired by near-death stories we've collected from community members and friends. Our band members will animate stories of trauma, grace, and recovery--and the role of personal and collective memory. These are heavy themes to be sure, yet what arises in all of these stories are exquisite recollections of beauty, humor, and hope. This is also our human legacy.</p>
<p>The Near Misses interweave music, storytelling, movement, and visual art in a subversive performance that will kick off with several performances in Charlottesville and then tour. Our producing artists include composer/performer Paige Naylor, stage designer Bolanle Adeboye, and Jennifer Hoyt Tidwell as instigator, director, and writer. Band members (in addition to Paige) include Katie Schetlick, Kara McLane Burke, and Catherine Monnes.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Producing, writing, composing, and rehearsing a new experimental opera with an ensemble requires a substantial commitment of time and expense. Paige, Bolanle, and Jennifer have spent 5 months so far planning the project, writing music, and designing prototypes of the portable set which will also serve as musical instrumentation. </p>
<p>Your donation will go towards fully developing the piece for premiering in June. Our expenses are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Artist Stipends</li>
<li>Rehearsal Space</li>
<li>Costumes &amp; Set </li>
<li>Marketing &amp; Promotion</li>
</ul>
<p>We are excited to make an ambitious, innovative collaboration in our community and to share the process with you along the way. If you're curious about the way we are making something like this, we will hold open rehearsals and a collaboration workshop as we get close to our premiere in June.</p>
<p>We will also be offering free tickets to our preview show at the Southern at the end of May.</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p><span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'>We are devoted to amplifying the voices and stories of women especially the underrepresented including our own. Just amongst the three of us producing artists, we have an immigrant woman of color, a queer solo mother and widow, and a female electronic music composer in a genre heavily dominated by men. Our opera focuses on other women's stories, but it contains ours and many other women's stories of trauma, grace, and recovery. It also acknowledges the near-death moment we're facing with our environmental degradation.</span></p>
<p>Some of us making The Near Misses have deep experience in collaboration and a track record of co-producing successful interdisciplinary performances such as CLAW, Shentai, A Charlottesville Wunderkammer, NO WAKE, now/now, and Ghost in Reverse, </p>
<p>A thriving and diverse local arts culture depends on a community that supports its working artists and welcomes experimentation and collaboration amongst artists. It creates a connected  and healthy ecosystem and takes us one step closer to making Charlottesville a viable home for its artists. By investing in this project and others like it, you are helping Charlottesville grow into the community we want it to be. And then we get to share the magic we made as we travel.</p>
<p>Thank you so much for considering donating. We look forward to updating you as we embark on this journey!</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>Through humor, this play reminds us that all 
relationships can be difficult - but that love, true love, is what compels us all. Humor is a perfect forum to remind us all of its importance, not only in
 relationships, but throughout society.<br/><br/><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">If we don't make this goal - </span>WE WILL STILL PERFORM!  We have the actors, the Fishtank rented from Feb. 2-18th (performance times TBA), however, we will have to produce the show at a lower quality than we originally planned and will need to take loans out for payment of the project.<br/><br/>Here are our performance times!  And even if you can't contribute, at least come see the show!!

</div></div>","Remember the first horrible date you went on? Remember the LAST horrible date you went on? Remember the time you swore off dating for good, then fell madly in love with the girl from 5A? Remember the time the girl from 5A turned out to be your long lost cousin?Yikes. It's a tough, unforgiving (and kind of sticky) world out there for love, but for some crazy reason...we keep trying. One man, Rich Orloff, begs to answer the question ""Why?"" and has more than one unhinged answer in, Romantic Fools. From the oddly primitive to the honestly insane, Orloff doesn't miss a beat in this vignette style boy-meets-girl-meets-boy-meets-you-get-the-picture comedy. Here's what others are saying about the show!ï¿½A side-splitting new comedy. Youï¿½ll ache from non-stop laughing.ï¿½
Show Business Weekly
ï¿½Hilarious!  Rich Orloffï¿½s play takes romantic situations over the top in this comedic look at the battle between the sexes.ï¿½
Milwaukee Journal-Sentinelï¿½The perfect date play.  Even if you're married, you might enjoy a date with your spouse for this.ï¿½
Akron NewsTHIS SHOW HAS NEVER BEFORE BEEN PRODUCED in Kansas City, and promises to be one night you and your date or spouse or...cousin, won't soon forget. The show will star the handsome Jeff Smith from 'The Outsiders', the hysterical 'A Very Joan Crawford Christmas' and the immensely popular 'Pride and Joy'. and quirky Katie Karel from the charming 'Seusical, the farcical 'Evil Dead' and the classic 'Evita', with Shea Coffman directing, Romantic Fools will run at the Fishtank Theatre in February;  February 2-18th with an additional performance on Valentine's Day.


The ImpactThrough humor, this play reminds us that all 
relationships can be difficult - but that love, true love, is what compels us all. Humor is a perfect forum to remind us all of its importance, not only in
 relationships, but throughout society.If we don't make this goal - WE WILL STILL PERFORM!  We have the actors, the Fishtank rented from Feb. 2-18th (performance times TBA), however, we will have to produce the show at a lower quality than we originally planned and will need to take loans out for payment of the project.Here are our performance times!  And even if you can't contribute, at least come see the show!!

<p>The duet is set to a recording of Jack Kerouac’s 1958 free-form poem “The Bowery Blues”. By identifying the rhythm, imagery, meter, and cadence in Kerouac’s prose, I then translated those elements to the body with the intention of creating a visual poem. I chose to have two women perform the work because although women were often the subject in Kerouac’s and his fellow beatnik’s work, there were not any women in the circle partaking in the creation process. The two women in <em>Kerouac’s Gift</em> are storytellers of sorts — casual bystanders of the transgressions taking place in Kerouac’s prose.</p>
<p><br/> I generated material through improvisation, collaboration with my partner, Sheila Klein, and was inspired by the rich and descriptive language Kerouac used to paint the city of New York and its idiosyncratic characters for his readers. My partner and I experimented with the juxtaposition between rhythm and melody, and explored what it is like to create gestures based on the text verses creating on the abstract.</p>
<p>The work will premiere on Sunday, April 15 at 8pm at Green Space in Queens. Tickets are $15.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Michel Heim est né à Paris en 1945.<br/>Il débute au théâtre dans la compagnie Les Caramels fous. Comédien et chanteur, il écrit, pour la célèbre troupe de gays militants, une dizaine de spectacles musicaux cocasses et débridés, dont <em>Les Dindes galantes</em>, qui obtient un Molière du Théâtre Privé, en 2006. Auteur d’une vingtaine de comédies pastiches, pseudo-littéraires ou historiques, il excelle en virtuose du détournement, poussant l’art du stéréotype pour en révéler les dessous plus complexes, plus humains. <br/>En 2012, Michel Heim écrit pour la compagnie Soleluna, <em>Besame Macho</em>, qui rencontre le succès la même année en Avignon. Il aborde pour la première fois le registre tragique avec <em>Le Maître et le Chanteur,</em> composé en 2013, en exclusivité pour la compagnie Soleluna.</p>

<p><strong>Fairmount Center for the Arts faces closure this fall without your help.</strong></p>
<p>For more than 40 years, Fairmount Center has been a place where students could discover their artistic talents and enjoy all the benefits that art can bring: creativity, self-esteem, friendship, mentorship, passion, healthy living, and even lifelong career opportunities. Fairmount Center's goal is to help all people - regardless of their age, ability, or training - explore themselves as creative and artistic beings.</p>
<p>After years of financial struggles, Fairmount is facing its most significant challenge yet: <strong>if we are not able to raise $50,000 in the coming weeks, Fairmount will be forced to close its doors this fall.</strong></p>
<p><strong><br/></strong>The goal of this online campaign is set at $20,000 from individual donors. However, we are seeking an additional $30,000 from foundations, corporations, and major gift donors, too.</p>
<p> <br/><strong>Our Challenge</strong></p>
<p>As you may know, Fairmount Center has faced significant financial challenges over the past five years, including the accumulation of credit card debt and the extension of its line of credit. This summer, the Board authorized a special campaign to let the community know about our dire financial situation and ask for its support to help us make up our cash shortfall. That effort yielded about $8,000 in support; a modest sum compared to the $35,000 we needed to cover expenses.<br/><br/> We saw a small infusion of cash in August from fall registrations which gave us reason to believe we might be able to overcome our challenges without significant outside support. However, we noted at that time that we did not know if the money we received was from new registrations and new money or merely early registrations from existing students. It now appears it was early registrations and not new. Our fall registration is only up about 5% over last year.<br/><br/> Moving forward, we will not have sufficient funds to make our next payroll or any payroll through the year end.  It is an understatement to say that this a dire situation for Fairmount. We cannot operate without paying our faculty and staff.</p>
<p><strong>What We Have Done</strong></p>
<p>In the last year, we have done the following to try to help turn things around for Fairmount. We believe these steps have prolonged the life of Fairmount but time has not been on our side and without signficant financial support we have not been able to significantly improve our situation. Since summer 2011, we have:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cut operating expenses by 15%</li>
<li>Engaged an accountant and began forecasting, created an operating budget, established a process for collecting on payments, and identified areas for savings </li>
<li>Began regular finance committee meetings with the Board of Directors to examine Fairmount's finances</li>
<li>Reduced debt spending and ceased using credit cards to make payroll</li>
<li>Began a plan for debt reduction and examined/re-negotiated credit cards and leases to try to save money and avoid interest and penalties</li>
<li>Cut programming that had resulted in major cash losses, including the elimination of professional theatre</li>
<li>Created new programming - particularly in the areas of dance and art and including events like Paint Nite; Sunday evening cafes; an enhanced tap program; dance mini-sessions; early childhood art workshops; PlopArt; mini-sessions and more.</li>
<li>Began meeting regularly as a staff which has strengthened our program offerings and fostered several cross-collaborations</li>
<li>Wrote proposals for more than $150,000 in foundation support</li>
<li>Planned and executed a large-scale benefit with $10,000 in revenue</li>
<li>Made significant changes to our building - nearly all by 100% donation - and made our facility more functional and welcoming</li>
<li>Hosted two community open house events to engage our public</li>
<li>Created Friends of Fairmount, an auxiliary group designed to provide support for Fairmount Center and its activities</li>
<li>Implemented Legally Addicted, a programming effort that has yielded terrific publicity for Fairmount and resulted in many new community relationships</li>
<li>Significantly increased our marketing efforts, resulting in several feature stories in local papers, an enhanced website, and Clear Channel radio spots</li>
<li>Explored ways to make our programs more profitable and reduce outside rental costs, particularly in the area of music</li>
<li>Began renting Fairmount for parties and events as an additional revenue stream</li>
</ul>
<p>Further, we are in the process of implementing on-line registration and a database program that we believe would take us to a new level in terms of accessibility for our students and new ways to reach our audiences.</p>
<p><strong>The Bottom Line</strong></p>
<p>Time is not on Fairmount's side. Despite our best efforts, unless something drastic happens in the next week, the Board of Directors anticipates we will close our doors this fall in what is called a ""wind down."" The details of this possibility are still being worked out and the Board will meet this Saturday, 10/13, to determine next steps.</p>
<p>If you value the arts - if you love Fairmount - if you believe our community is made stronger by having a place like Fairmount to gather and learn - please help. Any amount helps.</p>

At the end of every show there will be a discussion, in which the audience is encouraged to give a candid opinion. Art motivates individuals to embrace their community, and to respect the modern challenges faced by many. 
Risks & ChallengesA strong risk we run into when creating a theatre company is failure to satisfy our community. We believe to have some of the most talented actors in the city. Yet we cannot fulfill our dreams of acting if we do not have the funds to put on these shows. One of the advantages we have is that there are no other provocative theatre companies in Tucson. We also believe our repertoire could come off as vulgar and crude but we believe our target audience will appreciate us bringing to light several important themes.Other Ways You Can HelpYou don't have to donate to help us out! You can also share the campaign on your social media! And lastly you can come support us directly at our shows in Tucson, visit our website for more information, acting innocent.com.

<p>For her graduate solo performance thesis in May of 2016, Jess Otterbine created and perfromed an original theatrical piece entitled <i>Ophelia</i> that investigates Shakespeare's <i>Hamlet’s</i> young woman through a feminist lens. The piece came to explore this character in the context of positive female sexuality and abortion rights. </p>
<p>After a powerful reception of the piece, Jess decided to embark on a project to create a series of 5 solo-ish performances that would each use a different Shakespearean woman to interrogate contemporary feminist topics. Over the last year, Jess wrote a new piece entitled <i>Ravished</i> which follows Shakespeare's Lavinia of <i>Titus Andronicus</i> as she navigates rape culture and trauma.  </p>
<p>These pieces honestly, bravely, and openly discuss subjects that are deeply linked to the female experience. There is a deep need for these stories. That's where you come in. Produced in conjunction with Mz. Initiative and their Mz. Perspective series, Jess and her collaborators will mount a repertory of both <i>Ophelia</i> and <i>Ravished in January of 2018</i>.  </p>

Intergenerational Dialog

The impact of sharing TCM with the world is huge! For a new production company to be included in The National Black Theater Festival  is almost unheard of. TCM is an evening of stories- intergenerational stories we need to hear, especially today when the noise of pop-culture threatens to drown out the voices of the past. We need safe spaced to talk about things that are hard like...  


Race, class and gender
Sacrifices made by our ancestors
How to ""connect"" with today's youth



TCM does this through song, dance and imagery. Let us listen, truly listen to each others stories, help us hang them all on the line!

<p>I’m primarily a playwright, but I also direct, dramaturg, act, teach, and design sets, sound, and lights. I’ve written nine full-length plays and a bunch of shorter ones; my works have been performed in venues from Arizona to Florida to Ohio to Brooklyn, NY. I also wrote a book called <i>Workshopping the New Play: A Guide for Playwrights, Directors, and Dramaturgs </i>for students and professionals, especially those new to the important process of workshopping.</p>
<p>I'm asking for help to workshop my own latest play, <i>The Viking Suicides</i>. The idea behind workshopping is to take the rough draft of the play through a process involving seasoned theatre folks. After that, we’ll perform two staged readings where I’ll get all-important audience feedback that will help me ready the play to send out to potential producers. </p>
<p>Your help will enable me to make this happen.</p>
<p><strong>What we need:</strong></p>
<p>We have to rent rehearsal and performance space for a total of $450. Our director, stage manager, and seven actors will be compensated with small honoraria that total less than the minimum hourly wage (total of $1,485 for about 185 hours of work).</p>
<p>While most of our advertising will be through social media (which costs nothing but time), we still need to print posters, quarter cards, scripts, and programs, which together will run about $100. We’ll be using minimal sets, costumes, and props, for a total of $250.</p>
<p>That totals $2,285.</p>
<p>At the public staged readings we’ll suggest a donation of $10 per person, although what they actually give will be up to the attendees. We hope to earn $1,100 this way.</p>
<p>That leaves $1,185 to raise, which is what we’re hoping you can help with! Any overage will compensate the playwright, whose work is usually just a labor of love. And if the fundraising falls short, I’ll pay the costs out of pocket—alas, also not an uncommon occurrence in this business.</p>
<p><strong>What you’ll get:</strong></p>
<p><strong>$50</strong> <strong>donation</strong> includes a reserved seat at the show, your choice of Friday, April 27 or Saturday, April 28.</p>
<p><strong>$100 donation</strong> gives you a juicy speaking part in the show (which you can give away to someone else if you are too shy)!</p>
<p><strong>All donors</strong> will receive an official thank you in the program, and our deepest gratitude.</p>
<p>This play takes more of a social risk than my previous plays. My aim is to highlight the way many people follow the crowd and ultimately sacrifice their capacity for independent thought.</p>
<p>It would be great to have your support in this project as a donor and as someone who can help get the word out. And please try to come to the performances; we'll have talkbacks after each show and I'd love to hear your thoughts and impressions.</p>

<h3>The Blue Dog Project</h3>
<p>We are Blue Dog Project. For the last year we have been training in Rose Bruford's Master's in Ensemble Theatre programme, and we are pouring what we have learned into a new production. The four of us have come from three continents and four very different backgrounds to study theatre here in London, and our style of performance and production reflects and channels where we have come from. We will be performing in Summerhall, Upper Church, and are eager to share these powerful stories with the wider Edinburgh Fringe audience. </p>

<h3>What Does It Mean For Us?</h3>
<p>This is a one-of-a-kind opportunity for us as actors and theatremakers. The Edinburgh Fringe Festival is a place for taking risks and showing the theatrical world what we've got, and the possible benefits are endless; from awards and reviews to the possibility of having work produced, Edinburgh is a chance for bringing our work to a wider audience and taking it further in our careers. Your support helps us to focus solely on making the best work we can, without the nagging worry behind us of what the financials look like. </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Edinburgh itself is in many ways a risk. There are 3,000 shows going on during the festival, and while we have a huge advantage in the Summerhall venue, a known and recognized venue for good works, it's still a challenge to get people in the door. We are a new ensemble, and have not collaborated with each other in such a focused way before, and the production is mostly an untested work, having only had a couple of showings and being modified heavily now for this new run. The financial risks for us are, however, significantly less for us since we are not covering the costs of booking the venue. We are confident in the production and in our abilities, and we really looking forward to putting this work on its feet during the Festival. </p>

We are Blue Dog Project. For the last year we have been training in Rose Bruford's Master's in Ensemble Theatre programme, and we are pouring what we have learned into a new production. The four of us have come from three continents and four very different backgrounds to study theatre here in London, and our style of performance and production reflects and channels where we have come from. We will be performing in Summerhall, Upper Church, and are eager to share these powerful stories with the wider Edinburgh Fringe audience.

<p style=""margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal; font-family: Helvetica;""><span style=""font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12pt;"">I retired from the sheriffs office 18 months ago to open a dance fitness studio with Zumba as the core. </span></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal; font-family: Helvetica;""><span style=""font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12pt;"">I retired after 18 years of working mostly the worst areas of the county for Contra Costa County Sheriffs Department. I am also a disabled veteran of the United States Army. I found Dance Fitness (Zumba) and it changed my life. I lost 30 pounds and gained a confidence I didn't know was possible.</span></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal; font-family: Helvetica;""><span style=""font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12pt;"">
After two years of Zumba in a gym, I discovered a Brazilian instructor, Raquel, who taught some of her classes in a night club. </span></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal; font-family: Helvetica;""><span style=""font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12pt;"">
That summer, Raquel had three months of free classes for men. In the middle of one of her classes, Raquel stepped off the stage, found me in the middle of a class of more then 40 women and pulled me onto the stage to dance. Wow, that had never happened to me before. </span></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal; font-family: Helvetica;""><span style=""font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12pt;"">Because of Raquel, I have been a licensed Zumba instructor for the last four years.</span></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal; font-family: Helvetica;""><span style=""font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12pt;"">
The club was quite the dive, but her classes were always packed to over capacity. Each of Raquel's classes and master classes in this place were always special. </span></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal; font-family: Helvetica;""><span style=""font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12pt;"">
I realized these ladies wanted to dance in a bar like atmosphere without the bar type hassles (drunks and pick up lines). I loved the lights and stage but hated the smell of puke on the floor and the way the owner treated the instructor. </span></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal; font-family: Helvetica;""><span style=""font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12pt;"">
I thought they deserved a better place to dance and started dreaming of such a place. I started looking on behalf of Raquel. However, about that time, Raquel announced she was moving out of the country with her family. </span></p><p style=""margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal; font-family: Helvetica;""><span style=""font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12pt;"">
I wanted a dedicated space that had all the attributes of a dance club but dedicated to dance fitness. I started thinking I could open such a place myself. The studio would need to be able to make enough money to support itself and I would need to find an instructor as popular as Raquel. </span></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal; font-family: Helvetica;""><span style=""font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12pt;"">Those attributes would be a proper dance floor that would be easy on the knees and ankles and still look great, a great stage with easy access, a lighting and sound system, sound proofing and bathrooms (women judge you by your bathrooms). </span></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal; font-family: Helvetica;""><span style=""font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12pt;"">My first indication a dance fitness studio could make a profit was  when Raquel told me she would have made $20k the last month she was in California. </span></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal; font-family: Helvetica;""><span style=""font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12pt;"">I knew the only way I would have the money to open such a dance studio would be to retire. This was needed to get to my deferred compensation and retirement money. </span></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal; font-family: Helvetica;""><span style=""font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12pt;"">A year ago March 2013, the first location fell through because of unforeseen damage to the property. Another deal in a large shopping center fell through in May 2013. </span></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal; font-family: Helvetica;""><span style=""font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12pt;"">I did not find an appropriate location until September and due to licensing and construction delays, opened as Studio 925 Dance and Fitness in January 2014. </span></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal; font-family: Helvetica;""><span style=""font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12pt;"">I/we opened with several excellent instructors. Each class was like a party and grew every month from January to April. </span></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal; font-family: Helvetica;""><span style=""font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12pt;"">In addition to Zumba we offered U-Jam, Dance Fitness, kids dance and martial arts fitness classes.  We held several charity events, master classes and hosted two local college student events (Diablo Valley College, DVC).</span></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal; font-family: Helvetica;""><span style=""font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12pt;"">The charity events in part were for Hurricane victims in the Philippines and for a juvenile organ transplant recipient.  </span></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal; font-family: Helvetica;""><span style=""font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12pt;"">The music student union at DVC held a day of concerts that was awesome to behold.  The Chinese student union held a talent show. </span></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal; font-family: Helvetica;""><span style=""font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12pt;"">Some of the master classes and training classes have been over the top with some of the biggest names in the dance fitness world (PepperVon, Joy Smith, the Padia family and others) and we have more on line. </span></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal; font-family: Helvetica;""><span style=""font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12pt;"">We just finished a special summer class for kids with Down Syndrome from the George Miller Institute.

<p style=""margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal; font-family: Helvetica;""><span style=""font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12pt;"">Some of the reoccurring comments I hear from customers and visiting instructors alike are, ""we love the vibe here"", ""this place is so special"", ""there is no place like this"", ""photos don't do it justice"", ""we love Studio 925"", "" we love you (Dana and Michael), please don't go away"", even ""magical"".</span></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal; font-family: Helvetica;""><span style=""font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12pt;"">In April we had 1,200 people sign in. Not bad for a January opening. Unfortunately summer killed us with several city  (including the various cities surrounding us)  sponsored events like beer and wine festivals to vacations.  </span></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal; font-family: Helvetica;""><span style=""font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12pt;"">June was the worst but by the end of August we held our biggest events and have started our comeback. </span></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal; font-family: Helvetica;""><span style=""font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12pt;"">September and October are looking positive as well.

<p style=""margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal; font-family: Helvetica;""><span style=""font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12pt;"">With this in mind, I need to mention a few of the challenges I did not have or know I/we had when this adventure started.   </span></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal; font-family: Helvetica;""><span style=""font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12pt;"">In September 2013 my partner quit the day before I received the keys, leaving me without a lead instructor and partner. </span></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal; font-family: Helvetica;""><span style=""font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12pt;"">I took a full time job in San Francisco to help support the studio and my fiancée took over daily operations. We did this because I expended all my operating funds. In fact I spent all my retirement and savings to keep the studio operating. </span></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal; font-family: Helvetica;""><span style=""font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12pt;"">These monies were expended partly because we opened ten months later then I anticipated and the construction and labor costs were three times what was quoted. </span></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal; font-family: Helvetica;""><span style=""font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12pt;"">Also, Studio 925 is located in a somewhat secluded end of a shopping center off a main road in Pleasant Hill. I often hear locals say they didn't even know we were here.  </span></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal; font-family: Helvetica;""><span style=""font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12pt;"">This is why, beside rent, our most important need is an experienced professional promoter who is conversant with modern social media. </span></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal; font-family: Helvetica;""><span style=""font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12pt;"">After this is the need for an overhead sign to our building so people can find us. </span></p>

Changed lives… 
I wanted a place where these two goals could be achieved. I believe I am achieving these goals as we speak.

I wanted a dedicated space that had all the attributes of a dance club but dedicated to dance fitness. I started thinking I could open such a place myself. The studio would need to be able to make enough money to support itself and I would need to find an instructor as popular as Raquel. 
Those attributes would be a proper dance floor that would be easy on the knees and ankles and still look great, a great stage with easy access, a lighting and sound system, sound proofing and bathrooms (women judge you by your bathrooms). 
My first indication a dance fitness studio could make a profit was  when Raquel told me she would have made $20k the last month she was in California. 
I knew the only way I would have the money to open such a dance studio would be to retire. This was needed to get to my deferred compensation and retirement money. 
A year ago March 2013, the first location fell through because of unforeseen damage to the property. Another deal in a large shopping center fell through in May 2013. 
I did not find an appropriate location until September and due to licensing and construction delays, opened as Studio 925 Dance and Fitness in January 2014. 
I/we opened with several excellent instructors. Each class was like a party and grew every month from January to April. 
In addition to Zumba we offered U-Jam, Dance Fitness, kids dance and martial arts fitness classes.  We held several charity events, master classes and hosted two local college student events (Diablo Valley College, DVC).
The charity events in part were for Hurricane victims in the Philippines and for a juvenile organ transplant recipient.  
The music student union at DVC held a day of concerts that was awesome to behold.  The Chinese student union held a talent show. 
Some of the master classes and training classes have been over the top with some of the biggest names in the dance fitness world (PepperVon, Joy Smith, the Padia family and others) and we have more on line. 
We just finished a special summer class for kids with Down Syndrome from the George Miller Institute. This and the previously mentioned activities are where my heart is. 
Some of the reoccurring comments I hear from customers and visiting instructors alike are, ""we love the vibe here"", ""this place is so special"", ""there is no place like this"", ""photos don't do it justice"", ""we love Studio 925"", "" we love you (Dana and Michael), please don't go away"", even ""magical"".
In April we had 1,200 people sign in. Not bad for a January opening. Unfortunately summer killed us with several city  (including the various cities surrounding us)  sponsored events like beer and wine festivals to vacations.  
June was the worst but by the end of August we held our biggest events and have started our comeback. 
September and October are looking positive as well. With our number on the incline once again I have no doubt that it can only get better from here.   
With this in mind, I need to mention a few of the challenges I did not have or know I/we had when this adventure started.   
In September 2013 my partner quit the day before I received the keys, leaving me without a lead instructor and partner. 
I took a full time job in San Francisco to help support the studio and my fiancée took over daily operations. We did this because I expended all my operating funds. In fact I spent all my retirement and savings to keep the studio operating. 
These monies were expended partly because we opened ten months later then I anticipated and the construction and labor costs were three times what was quoted. 
Also, Studio 925 is located in a somewhat secluded end of a shopping center off a main road in Pleasant Hill. I often hear locals say they didn't even know we were here.  
This is why, beside rent, our most important need is an experienced professional promoter who is conversant with modern social media. 
After this is the need for an overhead sign to our building so people can find us. 
These are our most pressing needs. We are starting to gain momentum.  It would be very sad indeed if such a ""wonderful special place"" went away for the lack of operating funds.  
Therefore, I am requesting $55,000 for three things:
• 3 to 6 months of rent (triple net + rent) = $22,500 to $45,000
• Overhead building sign = $4000
• promotion and advertising = $500 month
I have short, medium and long term goals but I have taken to much time already.  I thank each and every person who visits this post and contributes. All I have to offer to contributors at this point are classes.

One of the longest-running Off-Broadway shows of all time, Little Shop of Horrors tells the story of Seymour Krelbourn, a struggling florist working on skid row. When he acquires a mysterious, alien plant he must choose between a simple, happy life with his true love, or fame and fortune at a very high price.Little Shop of Horrors will be free of charge for participants and audiences alike. Act III aims to provide access to theatre for as many students as possible - but we need your help. Again, donations can be made for any amount.This production would not be possible without your generosity. 
 
ABOUT ACT III 
Act III is dedicated to providing opportunities for creative expression and exposure for the UCLA student body through professional-level, quality student-run theatre.This mission is especially important on the UCLA campus, due to the limited opportunities for theatrical involvement on campus. The UCLA Department of Theatre produces one musical each year, with participation restricted to theatre students only. Act III stands out amongst other campus theatre organizations in its professionalism and its policy encouraging students of any major to participate—at no cost.Little Shop of Horrors will be Act III’s ninth production since our inception in 2008. Past productions have included the Wild Party, Sweet Charity, Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead, I Love You, Because and Xanadu.In addition to our productions, Act III hosts a yearlong musical cabaret and offers special master classes. We also produce two fundraising events: Bruins Care, a musical revue supporting Broadway Cares/Equity Fights AIDS, and 24 Hour Musical, a fully-staged musical mounted in 24 Hours to benefit No Limits, an organization that provides theatre programs to deaf children.
 
WHY WE NEED YOUR HELP 
Unfortunately, reaching our $5,000 goal will not close the gap in our budget. The statewide deficit has caused a continuing decrease UCLA organization funding. This is especially problematic for mounting a theatre production, as university funding sources already do not cover many of our expenses. With this limited institutional funding and without charging admission or membership fees, we rely on the generosity of individuals like you.Your contributions will help offset costs that include theater rental, equipment, performance rights, sets and costumes. You can make a big difference. Anything helps.  


$85 covers the cost of royalties for one performance 


$275 covers half of the rental cost for scripts and scores. 


$460 covers the the theater rental fee for one day. 


$805 covers the cost of performance rights & materials.

$1,550 covers all labor and equipment costs for one performance 
 
There is no way to fully show our gratitude for any and all contributions. 
So, please accept the heartfelt appreciation of everyone at Act III, the satisfaction of contributing to the arts and the perks of the Little Shop of Horrors-themed packages listed on this page.

<h3>The Project:</h3>
<p>Having worked for over 2 years to mount this powerful play, we have the theatre rented, rehearsals are well under way, and we are so close to bringing a really brilliant piece of important theatre back to the NY stage.  We are so close to our fundraising goals, we need your help to finish the remaining fundraising so we can present this play the way it deserves. This play hasn't been staged in the US in 80 years, and we want to make sure it is done correctly.</p>
<p><strong>Who We Are:</strong></p>
The Regroup Theatre Company was created in 2010 with the mission to produce ""great plays"" as defined by The Group Theatre as plays which are ""propaganda for a better life."" The ReGroup believes that entertaining the audience is not enough; the audience must also have a personal experience. By focusing on theatre's unique gifts - heightened dialogue, creative movement, controlled speech, stylized visuals and communion with a live audience - they hope to blow the years of dust off these plays and make them ""awake and sing"" once again.  In turn, they hope to inspire new playwrights to write material in this surging larger-than-life nature that will have social impact and relevance. Members of the company’s Board of Advisers include Angelica Page, Estelle Parsons, Austin Pendleton, Molly Regan, Susan Rowland, José Angel Santana, Lois Smith, Wendy Smith and Frances Sternhagen, among others.

<h2>What We Need</h2>
<p>We need to raise the remaining 14% of our budget. We are so close! Even with a volunteer company, the costs of putting on such a complex production is exorbitant.  <br/>With 25 rapid scene changes and over 60 characters, the design budget to make the show soar is not that of your usual off-off Broadway show.  We have things very streamlined, but in order not to skimp on the quality, we need to raise the extra funds.<br/>Anything over the amount we absolutely need will go toward advertising so we can make sure people see the quality work we have been doing.  This is a work that needs to be seen.<br/><br/></p>
<h3>What You Get!</h3>
<p><br/>Receive our eternal thanks along with other goodies! All donors will receive a thank you in our program, and different donor levels receive tickets, merchandise vouchers, advertising space in the program, and even associate producer credits.</p>
<p>ALL DONORS GET ACCESS TO EXCLUSIVE BEHIND-THE-SCENES REHEARSAL PHOTOS, ETC</p>
<p> </p>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Help us bring powerful, meaningful theatre to the public at a very affordable price.  When we've performed this piece in the past as a one-night-only staged-reading, it had a profound effect on the audience. Help us share it with a wider audience as a full length production.</p>
<p>In this politically devise ore-election time, this play helps show that we are all in this together.  It provides insight and compassion into the plight of the unemployed and the struggling. While the comparissons to the modern day are quite eerie, there is comfort in knowing that we've been here before and have found our way out of the dark.</p>
</div>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you are unable to make a donation, you can still help. Please spread the word about our production, volunteer to be on our guerilla marketing team, or pass this donation page on to someone who might be able to donate.  Your kindness is very much appreciated.</p>

<p>In June of 2012 I taped my very own one hour standup comedy special for CBC TV called, ""Ryan McMahon - UnReserved."" In doing so I became the FIRST Native Comedian to ever tape a one hour special for CBC TV - not bad for a kid that grew up in the bush in Northwestern Ontario. Also, this past summer I was invited to perform at the prestigious Just For Laughs Festival in Montreal - a childhood dream come true. While there I was named to the ""New Faces List."" This list is an high profile Industry list that gets published in Rolling Stone Magazine, SPIN and other Industry magazines and online blogs as the list identifies ""the next crop"" of ""can't miss, up and coming comedy stars"" that people in the Industry should be on the lookout for. Incredible.</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>In celebration of the most successful (relatively speaking) and rewarding summers of my life - I booked a tour. It began as a modest undertaking - 10 cities, 10 shows, during the month of October. Word got out that the tour was happening and the demand was incredible - people in places that didn't make the tour wanted the show to roll into their city. This was an incredibly humbing and exciting time for me. Quickly, the tour grew to 26 cities, 30 shows and I have 6 weeks to pull it off.</p>
<p>In general people are excited about what I've been able to accomplish in comedy. This is more than a dream come true for me. With art - all you can ever hope for is that people pay attention. Well, they are. And they have. And, so, here we are.</p>
<h3>WHY CROWFUNDING, WHY INDIEGOGO?</h3>
<p>As the tour was announced it got too big - many requests for shows in towns &amp; cities that I've never played in started to come and I really wanted to extend the tour to those fans that wanted to see the live show for the first time.</p>
<p>So here we are - the dates are booked, the cities are booked and work is well underway to make this tour the amazing success that I know it can be.</p>
<h3>WHAT WE NEED FOR THE TOUR</h3>
<p>Here is what we need to make the tour a success:</p>
<p>We're asking for a minimum of $15 000 to help offset a majority of the venue bookings costs &amp; the cost of paying technicians to help run the sound &amp; lights at the venues. While $15 000 might seem like a lot of money - it really isn't considering we're doing 30 shows in 26 cities in just under 6 weeks.</p>
<p>We'll also being using some of the funding to help with travel. Most of the tour will be done in ground transportation and the money is NOT being used for First Class airtravel or anything ridiculous. We're travelling humbly and modestly in the most economically reasonable way possible.</p>

<p><strong>What is Genius for Men?</strong></p>
<p>Genius For Men brings honor and innovation to DC through a men’s empowerment forum that fosters community between men and women, celebrates male achievement, and honors men who seek to transcend the limits within their professions. GFM honors was started by two sisters who would like to showcase the ways in which men meet the mark in our communities. The Genius for Men Honors is a full production in which we recognize men who are meeting the mark in our communities. Genius for Men is unique in that men and women attend and facilitate the entire event.  We tell their stories through tributes that feature emerging performing and visual artists. </p>
<p>Genius for Men is pleased to announce 2012 Honorees: Boys and Girls Club of Greater DC, Maestro Darin Atwater of Soulful Symphony, Impact Your World, Activist and Journalist Jeff Johnson, Rev.

<p><strong>From the Founder:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Dear Contributors,</strong></p>
<p><strong>Genius for Men is a project near and dear to my heart because I became frustrated about the narratives that say that black women are overly educated and that black men are overly incarcerated. I was tired of media coverage on men that praised their physical attributes but not their thoughtfulness and conscious inclusion of us in their work. I KNOW AMAZING BROTHERS WHO HAVE HELD MY SISTERS AND I DOWN. This is my way of modeling the sort of hospitality, research, and curiosity that we desire from men. Each year I receive emails and letters from men and women who confess that they began to see each other differently, after this event. Though I may be a graduate student, with student resources, I submit this work as a prayer for the fathers, brothers, sons and friends who should have positive models of men who know how to be there for, with, and beside us.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Play Synopsis:</strong><br/>Inspired by the stories of survivors of the Rape of Nanking, the production marks the 75th anniversary of this forgotten holocaust of WWII. RED SNOW is a story of love and the struggle to reconcile the past with the present in the search for peace and healing.  Isabel’s recurring nightmare of her grandparents’ favorite Chinese opera drives her to search for their silenced story. On her journey she falls in love with Jason, a man who is connected to the same forgotten holocaust. Their love unleashes three generations of guilt and pain perpetuated by a massacre still denied by the perpetrators today. When their lives collide they struggle to reconcile the past with the present - for themselves and their families, shaken from their lifelong silence by Isabel’s pilgrimage to uncover the secrets of her grandmother’s history ... and her own.</p>

<p>Red Snow had its world premiere at the Theatre Passe Muraille in Toronto, Canada, in January 2012.  We are the only Canadian theatre company (among the ten countries  chosen for 2012 festival) to be invited to the ACT Shanghai International Contemporary Theatre Festival in November. This will be our international premiere, opening up opportunities for our thirteen artists and crew in a forum of artistic and cultural exchange.  The ACT Shanghai International Contemporary Theatre Festival was founded in Japan in 1999, to showcase theatre productions from across Asia.  Since relocating to Shanghai, China, in 2005, the theatre festival's showcase has expanded internationally, to include Europe, the United Kingdom, the Middle East, Canada, and the United States.  Shanghai is one of the major Asian cities for culture and the arts, drawing artists and audiences from around the world.  Red Snow's international premiere presentation is especially important and poignant for both the production and the local Chinese audience, for the presentation of Red Show in China will commemorate the massacre and the horrors and the injustice committed in Nanjing in 1937.</p>

Play Synopsis:Inspired by the stories of survivors of the Rape of Nanking, the production marks the 75th anniversary of this forgotten holocaust of WWII. RED SNOW is a story of love and the struggle to reconcile the past with the present in the search for peace and healing.  Isabel’s recurring nightmare of her grandparents’ favorite Chinese opera drives her to search for their silenced story. On her journey she falls in love with Jason, a man who is connected to the same forgotten holocaust. Their love unleashes three generations of guilt and pain perpetuated by a massacre still denied by the perpetrators today. When their lives collide they struggle to reconcile the past with the present - for themselves and their families, shaken from their lifelong silence by Isabel’s pilgrimage to uncover the secrets of her grandmother’s history ... and her own.

Red Snow是一个关于爱情的故事，同时也是一个在过去与现在之间挣扎调和，以追寻平复与疗伤的故事。伊莎贝尔的祖父母最爱的京剧剧情不断出现在她的梦魇中，驱使她踏上去寻找他们那些沉默的故事的旅程。旅途中，她与杰森堕入情网。而把杰森和她联系在一起的却是同样的那一场被遗忘的大屠杀。

<h2>Moonshiner: A Musical Fabulism</h2>
<h3>The beginning.</h3>
<p>A few years ago I reconnected with an old friend, Jason, during the production of a musical (I was music directing, he was playing in the pit). We took a break one afternoon to get a mani/pedi, bro-style.  As we whiled away our time in the spa I started bemoaning the fact that current pop culture was dominated by really serious vampires and werewolves. I told Jason that I liked ""Teen Wolf"" and that kind of tongue-in-cheek treatment of the the supernatural and undead. Jason casually suggested I write a show, so I did!<br/><br/>The end result is this piece, ""Moonshiner."" A supernatural spoof of classic film noir, with jazz, rock-a-billy, doo-wop, and a couple of musical surprises; a delightfully silly one-act musical; and a mythical fable about the origin of rock'n'roll!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Why we're here.</h3>
<p>Some time after that spa afternoon, I became the artistic director of the <a href=""https://thez.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Zeiders American Dream Theater</a>. I created a series called ""The Hatchery"" that focusses on developing new theatrical works as part of our broader mission, and I plugged what I'd started calling ""Moonshiner"" into the calendar. We produced a reading of the show in 2015, and then did a full workshop in 2017. I submitted the show to a few places, and the <a href=""https://www.cmtf.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Chicago Musical Theatre Festival</a> selected it!</p>
<p>Here's the challenge: we- <a href=""https://thez.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">The Z</a>- need to raise some money to produce this show at the festival. Or, as Pete Rock of ""Moonshiner"" might say- ""We need some dough, daddy-o!""</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What we're doing.</h3>
<p>We're going to produce ""Moonshiner"" in full at CMTF. This doesn't mean just the actors and musicians- it also means costumes, props, projections, and all the other theater stuff. And marketing- tons of marketing. We're doing this because we believe that this show is a hit- it's family-friendly, engaging, twisty &amp; turny. It's got story the way hurricanes have wind- from all directions. And it's all packaged in one act, about as long as a typical film noir from the 50's.</p>

<h3>How you can help.</h3>
<p>Quite simply, donate to the project! The Z is a 501(c)3 not-for-profit organization, so your contribution is tax-deductible!* Every little bit helps, from $20 to $2,000. It all ads up to helping us get this show on the road!</p>

<p>For over 30 years--through workshops, retreats, classes and productions--we at Artistic New Directions have developed new theatre pieces.  We have a special interest in the intersection of improvisational and scripted theatre.  Without-a-Net is one intersection.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>For a Without-a-Net production, we give an original five-character play to five directors who, in turn, each cast five different actors.  The play is rehearsed separately by each director and cast.  Then, over two weeks, we present 25 performances of this one play with a different cast for every performance.  At each performance, one actor is called from each of the five companies.  The five actors encounter each other for the first time when they meet on stage.

</div></div>","For over 30 years--through workshops, retreats, classes and productions--we at Artistic New Directions have developed new theatre pieces.  We have a special interest in the intersection of improvisational and scripted theatre.  Without-a-Net is one intersection.


For a Without-a-Net production, we give an original five-character play to five directors who, in turn, each cast five different actors.  The play is rehearsed separately by each director and cast.  Then, over two weeks, we present 25 performances of this one play with a different cast for every performance.  At each performance, one actor is called from each of the five companies.  The five actors encounter each other for the first time when they meet on stage.  While they all have prepared their own characters (they have memorized their lines and understand the relationships to the other characters as written), they encounter the other characters as played anew every time the lights come up.  They fly without a net in a performance requiring complete trust.  The lines may be set but in all other respects the show is improvised, with discoveries surprising those on either side of the lights.

<p>Buongiorno a tutti,</p>
<p>il mio nome è Manolo Perazzi, sono un artista abruzzese e lavoro nell’ambito della danza contemporanea.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Ho presentato il mio lavoro, Crossover, all’interno del festival Oriente Occidente di Rovereto durante il mese di Settembre 2017. Ecco a voi una piccola presentazione:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“L’autore affida alla parola inglese crossover lo stato emotivo e fisico della sua danza. Questo lavoro cattura l’uomo sospeso tra il reale e l’immaginario, tra istinto e razionalità, impulsi e freni, guidato da un’energia che non si interrompe anche quando sembrerebbe accennare ad un’involuzione, ad un arresto. Si cerca un controllo al proprio flusso di azioni e pensieri.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>L’idea del progetto nasce da alcune domande: come l’essere umano con il suo corpo può cambiare in relazione ai mutamenti dell’ambiente che lo circonda? Di che natura sono gli impulsi che esso riceve da un ambiente che sta mutando? Qual’è la reazione del corpo ad un mutamento, cosa percepisce e che tipo di trasformazione avviene all’interno? Nel lavoro, gli interpreti vengono collocati sempre in un nuovo ambiente, i loro corpi vengono plasmati in relazione ad esso e alla situazione che si viene a creare. L’uomo si perde, smarrito in un caos mentale che rispecchia la confusione dell’ambiente esterno: viene continuamente costretto al cambiamento.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Il lavoro, è stato pensato per tre persone: due danzatori e la musicista e regista del suono Flavia Massimo la quale, attraverso un violoncello, un synt e una loop station costruisce la partitura sonora; è lei a dettare le regole dello spettacolo e del movimento, lei a governare sui performer, è un elemento esterno al di sopra delle parti. Durante la prima residenza è nata quindi un’interazione che ha portato Flavia oltre che a comporre la musica originale dello spettacolo anche ad essere di fatto un interprete che si muove, abita e condivide la scena. È lei a scandire lo spettacolo delineando la costruzione di un percorso sonoro che interagisce con gli interpreti accompagnandoli e guidando la loro danza”.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Sono stato selezionato per una residenza artistica presso il Did Studio di Ariella Vidach e il progetto avra’ luogo nel mese di Gennaio 2018. Mi sono stati offerti 20 giorni di residenza.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Sto lanciando la mia campagna di crowdfunding per avere modo di reperire i fondi necessari per pagare gli artisti.</p>
<p>-              20 giornate lavorative per 3 artisti;</p>

<p>I presented my last work as a dancemaker, Crossover, at  Oriente Occidente Festival in Rovereto in September 2017. Here a short description of the dance project:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“The author recognises in the English word “crossover” the emotional and physical status of his own dancing. This work captures the man between real and imaginary, instinct and rationality, impulses and brakes, being led by an energy that does not interrupt itself no matter what the external circumstances are.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The idea of the project generates from some questions: how can the human being with his own body react in relation to the changes within the surrounding environment? What kind of impulses does a change generate? Performers are always placed in a new environment, their bodies are shaped accordingly to to new situation. Man is lost in a mental chaos that reflects the confusion of the external environment: he is forced to change, perpetually.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In the work, the two dancers interact with the musician and director of the sound Flavia Massimo, who, through a cello, a synt and a loop station, builds up a live sound score; she dictates the rules of the show and the movement, she takes control of the performers; she is an outside element beyond the parts. She gives shape to a soundtrack which leads the performers throughout their path”.</p>

This is the FIRST YEAR we will be representing Chicago and the USA in 3 categories, Varsity, Adult and MegaCrew. Through an intense 10 day competition of 40+ countries, Hip Hop International's mission is to unite the world of hip hop through dance. HHI continues to be the world's ambassador in promoting hip hop dance culture.

How You Can Help

There	are	a number of costs	involved	through out our journey to HHI.	 Thousands	of	dollars	will	be	
spent	to	cover: rehearsal studio	rental	fees, competition fees, costumes fees,	transportation,	hotel	
accommodations, and	much	more. Through your contribution, our hope is to raise $3000 to cover	these	expenses. 

    

You've Donated! Now What?

Outstanding! Your support is greatly appreciated. You will receive an email at the conclusion of the campaign with information on how to claim your perk.

</b></p><p><b>It
takes a lot of money to produce a show like <i>Little
Miss Glitz, </i>a show that requires this much sparkle and glitter. We need your
help to make it happen. Every dollar you donate will go towards adopting a
sequin to put on our pageant dresses to make us sizzle and shine like we’ve
always dreamed. </b></p><b>
</b><p>Premiering
March 11-26 at the PAL Studio Theatre in Vancouver, this is your chance to
support the pageant event of a lifetime. </p><p></p><p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""></span></p><h3>The Show</h3><p></p><p><i style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""></i></p>
<p><i>Little
Miss Glitz </i>is a full-scale, over-the-top parody of child
beauty pageants set to some of the biggest pop hits of the past 30 years. </p>
<p>The show sets the questionable beauty standards
and parenting practices of hit reality TV’s <i>Toddlers
and Tiaras </i>to music in a high-energy musical with a twist: there is no
scripted winner. Each night, a panel of judges pulled from the audience will
determine who wins, leaving the cast to improvise the end of the show. Who will
win the pageant? You’ll have to see it to find out.  </p>
<p>Adding to this element of surprise is a
heartwarming story of Isabella Connor, a frumpy and impressionable 7-year-old
played by Paige Fraser, as she navigates through the world of child beauty
pageants. While at first pageants seem like a fun way to dress up, have fun and
get a foot in the door of stardom, Isabella soon discovers that the cutthroat
world of pageants takes no prisoners. You have to fight to survive.</p>
<p>Shocking, sassy, and uncompromisingly funny<i>, Little Miss Glitz</i> questions modern
society’s obsession with a person’s looks to uncover the beauty within. Coupled
with Dawn Ewen’s fearless direction and show-stopping choreography, and Stewart
Yu’s pop-savvy music direction, <i>Little
Miss Glitz</i> promises to take you on a musical adventure like you’ve never
seen before. </p>
<p>Go Glitz or go home!</p>
<p><b></b></p><h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3><p>We
need to raise $2,500 to help us get this show off the ground. As you can
imagine, producing a big-budget musical production is a daunting task,
especially for a brand-new non-profit theatre production society like ours. We
need your help to make our dream become a reality. </p>

It
takes a lot of money to produce a show like Little
Miss Glitz, a show that requires this much sparkle and glitter. We need your
help to make it happen. Every dollar you donate will go towards adopting a
sequin to put on our pageant dresses to make us sizzle and shine like we’ve
always dreamed. 
Premiering
March 11-26 at the PAL Studio Theatre in Vancouver, this is your chance to
support the pageant event of a lifetime. The Show
Little
Miss Glitz is a full-scale, over-the-top parody of child
beauty pageants set to some of the biggest pop hits of the past 30 years. 
The show sets the questionable beauty standards
and parenting practices of hit reality TV’s Toddlers
and Tiaras to music in a high-energy musical with a twist: there is no
scripted winner. Each night, a panel of judges pulled from the audience will
determine who wins, leaving the cast to improvise the end of the show. Who will
win the pageant? You’ll have to see it to find out.  
Adding to this element of surprise is a
heartwarming story of Isabella Connor, a frumpy and impressionable 7-year-old
played by Paige Fraser, as she navigates through the world of child beauty
pageants. While at first pageants seem like a fun way to dress up, have fun and
get a foot in the door of stardom, Isabella soon discovers that the cutthroat
world of pageants takes no prisoners. You have to fight to survive.
Shocking, sassy, and uncompromisingly funny, Little Miss Glitz questions modern
society’s obsession with a person’s looks to uncover the beauty within. Coupled
with Dawn Ewen’s fearless direction and show-stopping choreography, and Stewart
Yu’s pop-savvy music direction, Little
Miss Glitz promises to take you on a musical adventure like you’ve never
seen before. 
Go Glitz or go home!
What We Need & What You GetWe
need to raise $2,500 to help us get this show off the ground. As you can
imagine, producing a big-budget musical production is a daunting task,
especially for a brand-new non-profit theatre production society like ours. We
need your help to make our dream become a reality. 
Your
donation helps us to:


Buy
costumes, and glitter them to the gods;


Build
sets;


Rent rehearsal
space;


Pay for
our venue rental;


Print
lots of posters, postcards, etc. to help us market the show, and;


Buy
more sequins, glitter and rhinestones than we can possibly handle.


We
have come up with some amazing perks for you, our wonderful donors, friends and
supporters, including tickets to the show and autographed merchandise.
The ImpactIn
the high-stakes world of musical parodies, every little bit helps and there is
no donation too small. Everything that is donated to this campaign will be lovingly
used to realize our dream of having this show come to life. It is our goal, no,
our duty to make this musical a reality, and need your help to make it happen. As
the ancient proverb goes: It takes a whole online community to produce a new
musical!
About Us
Too
Fly Productions is made up of are a group of creative people who support each
others’ visions and help our dreams become a reality. No creative pursuit is
out of bounds or too ridiculous to realize. Except perhaps an all unicorn water
polo team – they pop too many balls.
Creativity
and performance is our passion. We seek out others who are equally passionate
about what they do to join us in creating fresh collaborative works. Our
projects are a chance for emerging artists to showcase their talents in a
supportive environment while nurturing joy for the craft. In other words, we
put the “fun” in “theafuntre”.

<p>SlamBamDance! is an immersive dance and rock music performance

audiences. Our first event in May was a smashing success (see video promo

level. Your contributions will help SlamBamDance! take its production value sky rocket, with a goal providing funds to keep SlamBamDance! going and of documenting the choreography process for a
television docu-series. I truly want to show the world my passion for bringing
professional dance and live rock music together. It's incredible important me to be able to provide the artists and bands with funding because of the hard work they put into their passions! We know all too well that artists don't get the financial support they truly deserve.</p>
<p>This event features choreography by SlamBamDance! Creator and

<p>Christopher Kelley, award

placed this bundle into the hands of the esteemed theatrical company Theatre of
NOTE. Elegant in its simplicity, <i>Whiskey
Maiden </i>is an allegorical piece surrounding Billy, a worldly, intuitive
homeless man with a bewildering mythology and Phil, an extremely wealthy former
agent now forced out and fearing for his life.</p>
<p>We are excited to bring Christopher Kelley’s
latest creation to life on our stage, BUT WE CAN’T DO IT WITHOUT YOU!</p>
<p>We at Theatre of NOTE
are very passionate about our productions and quite creative ourselves. These funds would go towards …</p>
<ul>
<li>Costumes for 7 separate characters</li>
<li>Designer Stipends – We believe that these talented and
     dedicated theatrical artists should be compensated for their hard work and
     the countless hours that they invest. The Costume Designer, Set Designer,
     Audio Designer, Lighting Designer, Prop Master, Graphics Designer, Stage
     Manager, Master Carpenter,… </li>
<li>Building materials, lighting &amp; sound design elements, painting supplies, etc.</li>
<li>Programs, postcards, &amp; a banner for the front of the
     theatre.</li>
</ul>
<p>We need to raise at
least an additional $2,000 in order to mount the production that we believe the script
deserves and we are hoping to raise as much of that as possible with this campaign.</p>
<p>All donations are tax

$2,000…but
the sky is the true limit and any amount will help!
**Be sure to check out
our amazing donation incentives**A NEW INCENTIVE HAS BEEN ADDED AT $75!
The Basics…
Christopher Kelley, award
winning playwright and director, has written yet another wonderful play and
placed this bundle into the hands of the esteemed theatrical company Theatre of
NOTE. Elegant in its simplicity, Whiskey
Maiden is an allegorical piece surrounding Billy, a worldly, intuitive
homeless man with a bewildering mythology and Phil, an extremely wealthy former
agent now forced out and fearing for his life.
We are excited to bring Christopher Kelley’s
latest creation to life on our stage, BUT WE CAN’T DO IT WITHOUT YOU!
We at Theatre of NOTE
are very passionate about our productions and quite creative ourselves. These funds would go towards …

Costumes for 7 separate characters
Designer Stipends – We believe that these talented and
     dedicated theatrical artists should be compensated for their hard work and
     the countless hours that they invest. The Costume Designer, Set Designer,
     Audio Designer, Lighting Designer, Prop Master, Graphics Designer, Stage
     Manager, Master Carpenter,… 
Building materials, lighting & sound design elements, painting supplies, etc.
Programs, postcards, & a banner for the front of the
     theatre.

We need to raise at
least an additional $2,000 in order to mount the production that we believe the script
deserves and we are hoping to raise as much of that as possible with this campaign.
All donations are tax
deductible as Theatre of NOTE is a 501(c)(3).
THANK YOU FOR YOUR SUPPORT AND ENJOY OUR DONATION INCENTIVES!
Hopefully some of our
featured incentives will inspire you. Even more important, we hope that your
desire to support new art, amazing theatre, and this exceptional script will
inspire you. We will be grateful for any donation, no matter how small. If you’re

<p>Milwaukee Irish Arts is proud to host the 2016 Acting Irish
International Theatre Festival (AIITF) from May 24-29 at Next Act Theatre in
Milwaukee. Founded more than 30 years ago, the AIITF has been held annually by
its member Irish theatre companies in cities around the U.S., Canada and
Ireland. Continuing this long tradition of showcasing Irish works, this year Milwaukee
welcomes theatre groups from Chicago, Cincinnati, Rochester NY, Del Ray Beach
FL, Calgary and Winnipeg in Canada, and Dublin, Ireland to present a wide
variety of offerings in an exciting week of Irish theatre.</p>
<p>Momentum for the festival is building locally with planning
for fundraising, hotel accommodations, adjudicator selection, programs, transportation
and reception venues spearheaded by a dedicated local festival committee.</p>
<p></p>
</div><div>
<h3>Why we need your help</h3> <p><span style=""background-color: initial;""></span></p>
<p>Fundraising for the festival is a huge challenge and your
support is crucial to making the festival a success. Among the many expenses we
need to cover: </p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>Housing for participating groups at
the InterContinental Milwaukee</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>Rental of Next Act Theatre</p>
<p>·<span>

space at Next Act Theatre as the festival headquarters, which will provide the
flexibility needed to present nine different plays in six days with production

<div></div> </div> <div> <h3></h3>
<h3>Fundraising Challenges</h3>
<p>Our skilled and dedicated festival committee has been hard at work seeking funds from grant sources and local businesses, and we’re already thrilled to welcome Northwestern Mutual, We Energies and Milwaukee Irish Fest as partners. But the additional donations of individuals, Irish theatre fans and organizations are absolutely essential for us to achieve our funding goals and allow us to host the best festival in the history of AIITF this May.</p>
<h3>The Impact</h3> <p></p>
<p>The mission of Milwaukee Irish Arts for over 30 years has
been to bring the Irish story to American audiences. Hosting the 2016 Acting
Irish International Theatre Festival not only continues the tradition of the
festival, but brings nine Irish plays to Milwaukee for local audiences to enjoy.
According to Irish theatre festival tradition, all performances are assessed by
an experienced adjudicator, who shares his/her evaluation with the cast and
audience following each show, making the performances a learning experience for
all.</p>
<p>Milwaukee Irish Arts hopes to impress with this year’s
production of Sean O’Casey’s epic “The Plough and the Stars,” to be presented
on the opening night of the festival in commemoration of the 100<sup>th</sup>
anniversary of the Easter Rising in Dublin.</p>
<p>The festival affords an excellent opportunity to participating
groups to improve their craft by sharing their work and ideas, in addition to
receiving invaluable critique by trained adjudicators.</p>
<p>Awards are given out at a final brunch on Sunday, May 29.
Milwaukee Irish Arts has won numerous awards at the AIITF over the years,
including awards for Best Production, Best Actor/Actress/Supporting Actor and
Director. </p>

<strong>About the Show</strong><em>:</em>
</h2>
<p><em></em><em>FREAK PLAYGROUND</em> is an original play by me, Keiko Green.  It follows 6 women on a playground, slowly retreating back into their childhood roles and games. </p>
<p>The show explores themes of sibling rivalry, bullying, competition, gender roles, drugs, and sex. All of the characters are based on playground children, and we will be recreating many playground structures (the slide, the swings, etc.) through representational movement.   </p>
<p>With aspects of dance, chance, and masks, this 60-minute performance is planned to perform in Seattle on July 6th &amp; 7th. The final script will be presented in mid-May, with rehearsals beginning right as the fundraising campaign comes to an end on May 21st.</p>
<h2>About Me:</h2>
<p><img alt=""Keiko Green"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://tpsonline.org/publicDB/images/full/8538_1334896350.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""KG""/></p>
<p>My name is Keiko Green. I'm a 26 year-old half-Japanese theatre artist. I got my BFA in Theatre from NYU's Tisch School of the Arts, studying mostly under the Experimental Theatre Wing. I like to mix little kid things with grown up things. I think it's important to say something with a show, but I take the word ""entertainment"" very seriously. I am here to entertain you!</p>
<h2><strong>Only 2 Nights?</strong></h2>
<p><strong></strong><em>Freak Playground</em> has already been submitted to a few festivals, and will continue to grow. But we need your help. I also have plans to do at least one site-specific version of the show at a local playground.</p>
<h2><strong>Why $3,000?</strong></h2>
<p><strong></strong>The goal amount is the bare minimum of what it will cost to put up this production.<br/>This includes rehearsal/performance space, the (unfortunately very little) pay for talent and crew, costumes, props, posters, etc. Anything you can give will be GREATLY appreciated!</p>

<h3>Thank you so much for your support! We'll keep you updated, and I'll see you at the show!</h3></div>","About the Show:

FREAK PLAYGROUND is an original play by me, Keiko Green.  It follows 6 women on a playground, slowly retreating back into their childhood roles and games. 
The show explores themes of sibling rivalry, bullying, competition, gender roles, drugs, and sex. All of the characters are based on playground children, and we will be recreating many playground structures (the slide, the swings, etc.) through representational movement.   
With aspects of dance, chance, and masks, this 60-minute performance is planned to perform in Seattle on July 6th & 7th. The final script will be presented in mid-May, with rehearsals beginning right as the fundraising campaign comes to an end on May 21st.
About Me:

My name is Keiko Green. I'm a 26 year-old half-Japanese theatre artist. I got my BFA in Theatre from NYU's Tisch School of the Arts, studying mostly under the Experimental Theatre Wing. I like to mix little kid things with grown up things. I think it's important to say something with a show, but I take the word ""entertainment"" very seriously. I am here to entertain you!
Only 2 Nights?
Freak Playground has already been submitted to a few festivals, and will continue to grow. But we need your help. I also have plans to do at least one site-specific version of the show at a local playground.
Why $3,000?
The goal amount is the bare minimum of what it will cost to put up this production.This includes rehearsal/performance space, the (unfortunately very little) pay for talent and crew, costumes, props, posters, etc. Anything you can give will be GREATLY appreciated!

THE CAST:
Sarah Bixler as Claire

Sarah J Eagen as Nik 
Elaine Huber as Katie

<p>This July, Lamondance has been invited to perform as a guest in the <em>Prestigious Summer Gala at the International Seminar of Dance </em>in Brasilia, Brazil. This invitation marks the end of the company's fourth season and the directors are excited to bring their talented group of dancers and their new full-evening show <em>Human</em> on the road!  The company will participate in a three-week long workshop with international teachers and choreographers and then tour with <em>Human</em> to the neighbouring cities of Taguatinga, Ceilandia and Sobradinho.</p>
<p>Lamondance was established in 2009 as a contemporary training and performance company for aspiring professional dancers. Directed by Lara Barclay, Monica Proença and Davi Rodrigues, the program offers dancers the opportunity to immerse themselves in original choreography and learn the motivation behind a professional dance company. The directors bring their unique international experience and passion together to guide students toward a career in dance. As well as nurturing young Canadian talent, Lamondance also invites select Brazilian students to join the program to share their experience and knowledge in dance. This allows for a wonderful cultural exchange between Canadian and Brazilian dancers.</p>
<p>Lamondance has showcased their work in various local and international performances, festivals and fundraisers including Vancouver Global Dance Project, Art Umbrella’s Sunday Performance Series, Move: the company, TanzArt Festival in Germany, Dancestreams, Art for Impact, Vancity Projects, One Night for 1 Day and the Cultch’s Ignite Youth Festival. </p>
<p>Lamondance operates as a Not-For-Profit Society, working under the umbrella of RNB Dance and Theatre Arts, based in North Vancouver.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<p>The company’s fundraising goal is to raise $5,000.00, an amount that will be put toward accommodations as well as transportation while in Brasilia.  Costs associated with performing abroad are expensive but it is important that our dancers are given this opportunity to perform and exchange with international artists.</p>
<p>Our dancers have already booked and paid for their own flights but we are still seeking support for their accommodation and transportation while in Brazil.   </p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>The Impact Your Contributions Will Have</strong></p>
<p>Any aid we receive here on Indiegogo will go toward off setting costs for the dancers and their paid chaperones while in Brazil as well as enable them to see the country and explore its rich history. This trip will change the lives of everyone on the journey, and your help will ensure that we are able to provide these deserving dancers with the best possible experience. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Lamondance is a creation center without limits, where movement and expression are explored through the physical language.  Your help is valuable to us because with it, we can plant more cultural seeds not only in Vancouver, but in Brazil where we can share our ideas with a broader community of artists.  </p>
<p>By making a donation, you will not only be helping Lamondance with their exciting trip to Brazil, you'll also be contributing to the development of world culture through dance.</p>

<p>So many of you have already helped with your financial contributions, time and emotional support. If you are unable to assist us with a contribution at this time, you can still help us by spreading the word! Feel free to share links to this page on your personal Facebook and Twitter accounts.

<h3>What's this all about?</h3>
<p>We all know psycho ex-girlfriends. Some of us have even been psycho ex-girlfriends. They’re on reality TV, stalking you on facebook, having lunch with your mothers and secretly showing up at your weddings “just to say ‘congratulations’”. They know your location, doctor’s name and social security number and their memories are impeccable. They love you so hard it just may hurt. <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">You</span>. But where, why and how were they created? Are they truly psychotic or simply victims of romantic crimes who were once innocent girls who looked for love in all the wrong places? Want to find out?</p>
<p><a href=""http://shelterbelt.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""The Shelterbelt Theatre"">The Shelterbelt Theatre</a>, Omaha's home for Certified Original theatre, is presenting Beaufield Berry's new original play, <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Psycho Ex-Girlfriend</span>, running from April 18th through May 12th. This is happening, but that's not to say we don't need your help!</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>The Shelterbelt has brought original plays to the Omaha theatre scene for 20 years now. We've developed new talent both on and off stage. We're dedicatied to continuing that tradition for at least another 20 years. But shows cost money to stage, and no matter how good the play, the cast, the production, it's just harder to get people to come see a show they've never heard of, written by someone they've never heard of, and performed by actors they've... you get the idea. The result is that a lot of our shows... really good shows that get great reviews... don't break even.</p>
<p>So we're trying something a little different this time. Our goal is to raise the money to cover the cost of the show before we open. Based on past productions, we're estimating this at $2000. This breaks down roughly as:</p>
<ul>
<li>$600 for the crew costs (designers, stage manager, house manager...)</li>
<li>$500 for production costs (sets, props, costumes...)</li>
<li>$900 for posters, mailers and other publicity. Even at bulk rates, mailing is expensive!</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What You Get</h3>

What We Need & What You Get Putting on a great show costs money.  We aren't looking for a lot (because we also believe that you don't need fancy digs and extreme - not to mention costly - measures in order to tell a great story), but there are still costs that must be covered.
Help us pay for:

Our talented, hard-working, and dedicated ACTORS!
Our talented, hard-working and dedicated CREW!
Advertising Material (flyers, posters, programs)
Costumes (we can't have naked nuns, after all)
Tech (so you can see and hear us)

How your good deeds will come back to you ten-fold:

You'll be supporting a fantastic show and local artists
Count this as your good deed for the day
Pick from some fun and interesting perks


And if we don't make our goal?  Well, as they say, the show must go on.


Ce dont nous avons besoin & Ce que vous obtenez en retour

Mettre sur pieds un grand spectacle coûte de l'argent. Nous n'avons pas besoin de beaucoup (car nous pensons aussi qu'il n'est pas nécessaire d'avoir des loges luxueuses ni de prendre des mesures extrêmes – pour ne pas dire coûteuses - pour raconter une belle histoire), mais il y a toujours des frais à payer.Aidez-nous à couvrir les frais pour:

Nos ACTRICES, talentueuse et dévouées, qui travaillent dur.
Notre EQUIPE, talentueuse et dévouée, qui travaille dur.
Le matériel publicitaire (flyers, posters, programmes)
Les costumes (nous ne pouvons pas avoir une religieuse dévêtue sur scène, après tout!)

Les supports technologiques (pour que vous puissiez nous voir et nous entendre)


Voici comment vos bonnes actions vous seront rendues décuplées:

Vous apporterez votre soutien à un spectacle fantastique et des artistes locaux
Considérez cela comme votre bonne action de la journée
Choisissez parmi les autres avantages intéressants et amusants qui s'offrent à vous

Et si nous n'atteignons pas notre objectif? Comme on dit, le spectacle doit continuer.
  The ImpactYour contribution will demonstrate the community's support of the arts and of its local storytellers.  Not to mention encouraging a higher standard for creative theatre experiences.L'Impact
Votre contribution témoignera du soutien apporté par la communauté aux arts et à ses conteurs d'histoires locaux. Sans compter le fait d'encourager un niveau supérieur de créativité théâtrale.
  Risks & Challenges  We're dealing with mature and graphic themes, challenging people's expectations and comfort zones.  We're taking the risk to make innovative and daring theatre.  With a passionate and dedicated team, we've already trouble-shooted our production process and come up with solutions as the journey takes us further into heaven (or down into hell).  Now all that's left is a little help from our friends ($$$).

Risques & Défis
Nous abordons des thèmes sérieux et graphiques tout en remettant en question les attentes du public et sa zone de confort. Nous prenons le risque de produire un théâtre innovant et audacieux. Avec notre équipe passionnée et dévouée, nous avons déjà analysé en profondeur notre processus de production et avons élaboré des solutions à mesure que ce voyage nous emmène plus loin vers le Ciel (ou en Enfer). Maintenant, tout ce dont nous avons besoin, c'est d'un peu d'aide de la part de nos amis ($$$).

  Other Ways You Can Help Don't have two pennies to rub together?  We still want your support!

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p><span>DoingSome Theatre is an emerging London theatre company comprised of graduates from the Royal Central School of Speech and Drama, which aims to push the boundaries of theatre. </span></p>
<p><span>Our debut show 'Exposure' explores the idea of superstition; its genesis, its effects, and the question of 'what if?' This performance will be constructed and framed by photography; in both the rehearsal process and the live event. We will examine people's representations, and what they choose to capture; to discover what is lost or gained in translation.</span></p>
<p><span>We are campaigning to raise funds for our production which will be performed as part of the Camden Fringe Festival. Our project is important to us as we are taking our first steps into the challenging and exciting field of experimental theatre and you can be a part of that process!</span></p>
<p><span>Without your contributions we would not be able to realise our debut production and any support we receive is greatly appreciated!</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We are aiming to raise £600 to fund our venue costs as well as our equipment and costume costs.</p>
<p>So far we have held three bake sales at our university to fund our fees to enter the festival, and now we are reaching further afield to fund our production costs.</p>
<p>We are also holding a fundraising event with live music, a photobooth, homemade baked goods, and a raffle to both raise funds, and awareness for the project.</p>
<p>By donating on our indiegogo page you will receive exclusive benefits as detailed in our 'perks' section!</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>

</div></div>","Short Summary
DoingSome Theatre is an emerging London theatre company comprised of graduates from the Royal Central School of Speech and Drama, which aims to push the boundaries of theatre. 
Our debut show 'Exposure' explores the idea of superstition; its genesis, its effects, and the question of 'what if?' This performance will be constructed and framed by photography; in both the rehearsal process and the live event. We will examine people's representations, and what they choose to capture; to discover what is lost or gained in translation.
We are campaigning to raise funds for our production which will be performed as part of the Camden Fringe Festival. Our project is important to us as we are taking our first steps into the challenging and exciting field of experimental theatre and you can be a part of that process!
Without your contributions we would not be able to realise our debut production and any support we receive is greatly appreciated!
 
 


What We Need & What You Get
We are aiming to raise £600 to fund our venue costs as well as our equipment and costume costs.
So far we have held three bake sales at our university to fund our fees to enter the festival, and now we are reaching further afield to fund our production costs.
We are also holding a fundraising event with live music, a photobooth, homemade baked goods, and a raffle to both raise funds, and awareness for the project.
By donating on our indiegogo page you will receive exclusive benefits as detailed in our 'perks' section!
 
 


The Impact
This project gives contributors the opportunity to be a part of a new, exciting and experimental form of theatre that we are passionate about, and the production will play a valuable part in the Camden Fringe Festival. 
This project ensures that we will be able to carry our successful theatre making from a university setting to the world of professional theatre, something which is daunting, but also bold and exciting!

Friends,

I knew
when I heard my good friend Melanie Jane Parker read her compilation of short stories for the first time that I needed to

beautiful, violent, and full of movement. This production will be performed in
a non-traditional space in Brooklyn combining art-installation, dance, theatre
and literature in a unique and meaningful way that enhances the stories and
continues to give them breath.


I am working with an amazing team of collaborators including Grace Courvoisier, Taylor Donofrio, Jonathan Cottle, Ryan Maeker, Chantel Pascente and Melanie Jane Parker
 
This piece has been on my mind for several years now and it is only now that I feel prepared to bring it to life.  Any assistance you can provide would be so appreciated as I embark on this very meaningful artistic journey.
 
Love,
 
Teff & The night-song and Te Ilum Family

 
We Can’t Do it Alone!

The Violet Hour



     The Violet Hour asks if you would have the courage, when surrounded by fear and uncertainty, to grab the reigns and lead your life in the direction of your dreams.  This is a play that examines the impact we all have on the world around us.  It's beautifully written, funny and heart-wrenching, and leaves you caring deeply about what will happen to every one of the characters.  
 
Culpability, desire, fate - these massive ideas converge in one small publishing office.




Why Us?
     The Violet Hour will kick off The Active Theater's 4th season of producing high quality contemporary American plays in New York City.  We do everything in our power to make sure our audiences have a phenomenal theatrical experience from top to tail.  We want you leave the theatre talking about what you saw - something that touched you, something that surprised you, something that outraged you, something that moved you.  We're telling human stories, encouraging human dialogue, and promoting a more humane world.

<h2 align=""center""><strong>“<em>My first experience of hearing Schuyler (Skye) Iona Press sing was one of </em>those<em> moments [being in the presence of greatness] and inspired me to share my appreciation for her remarkable talent</em>.” – Rebekah Blu, Avalon Magazine Spring 2012</strong></h2>
<h2><strong><span class=""notranlsate""> </span></strong></h2>
<h2><span class=""notranlsate""><strong>THE SHOW</strong><br/></span></h2>
<p>14-year-old singer songwriter <strong>Schuyler Iona Press</strong>, whose eclectic compositions include influences from modern folk, rock, and punk peppered with Latin grooves, is an outsider longing to be on the “inside”, yet simultaneously outraged by the implications of that — she's a kid entering adolescence and questioning her world. Accompanied by a live band, percussive modern Irish dancers and video, Schuyler brings us on a poetic imaginative quest into the depths of her emotions.</p>
<p>A mashup of theatrical drama/live concert/multimedia video, <strong><em>What I’m Failing To Learn</em></strong> takes us on a walking tour through the unpredictable streets of NYC and through the even more unpredictable mind of a young teenager.</p>
<p><strong><em>What I’m Failing to Learn</em></strong> is a personal journey of a child colored by both positives and negatives of growing up unsheltered from certain truths of our human world.  As Schuyler learns, truth holds both comedy and tragedy, but most importantly, truth holds hope. </p>
<h2><strong>WHERE YOUR CONTRIBUTIONS GO</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Your donations will help us cover some of the costs of staging this workshop production of ""What I'm Failing To Learn."" (anything generously donated above our goal will be valuable to us and go to good use for show expenses and recording the cast album) </strong></p>
<p><strong>Your contributions will go to:</strong></p>
<p>1. Audio and visual equipment used in the show: Sound system, projector, screen</p>
<p>2. Compensating our musicians, dancers, arranger and theater staff (producers, writers and directors are donating their services to this project)</p>

<p>5. Purchase of Marley dance floor</p>
<h2><strong>THE I AM TODAY PROJECT</strong></h2>
<p><strong>This workshop production will also help us raise awareness and support for the I AM TODAY PROJECT.<br/></strong></p>
<p><strong>THE I AM TODAY PROJECT </strong>is inspired by the song I AM TODAY, written by Schuyler at age nine and recorded by her at age ten. Schuyler wrote the song as a gift and it was her desire to use the song to raise money for pediatric cancer research.  'I am Today' has been on Itunes doing just this, but now Schuyler (and we) want to take it to another level.  The <strong>I AM TODAY PROJECT</strong> pairs children and teens in various at-risk situations (coping with life threatening and chronic illnesses, economic and social disadvantages, young victims of disasters and wars) with a mentor in the the arts.  Together with the guidance, friendship and support of his or her mentor, each child imagines and creates a personal and meaningful piece of art (poem, song, play, film, painting, etc.) The experience enriches the lives of the child, their loved ones, their mentor and many others who are able to witness the final creation.  The <strong>I AM TODAY PROJECT</strong> empowers young people with a creative ‘voice’ that tells their story, which in turn enriches the world.  Through creativity, young people learn to view their world with a sensitive eye and see themselves as important participants in making a positive impact.  Adults have much to learn from listening to the voices of these young people whose life experiences have given them unique perspective and understanding.  The children also gain practical skills by conceiving a vision, working with a partner and seeing a project through to finish.  The <strong>I AM TODAY PROJECT</strong> aims to expose young people, and the adults who care for and about them, to the healing and life affirming power of creativity and to help them understand and exert their own important ""voice.""  The final works of art will also serve as a means of promoting understanding, peace, hope, positive communication and purpose for our young mentees and those many people who are and will be affected by them.  Positve Creativity can heal our world! </p>

A May Sky Picture Entertainment Youth Education Initiatives
MAY SKY MENTORS
In an effort to honor the natural and necessary relationship between positive artistic contribution and positive social contribution, A May Sky Picture Entertainment utilizes the process of development and production of their live and filmed performing arts as living classrooms in which youth from diverse backgrounds are paired with artist mentors.
THE MAD INITIATIVE
A May Sky Picture Entertainment developed the MAD (Make A Difference) Initiative in order to foster a new generation of social entrepreneurs.  The Mad Initiative is a full curriculum geared towards Middle School and High School students.  Through a series of creative exercises and hands on projects students are challenged to think as social entrepreneurs, critically examining their world, their place in it, and their personal ability to make a positive difference with their lives and their career choices.  While fostering social consciousness and responsibility as well as skills of positive teamwork, problem solving and creativity, students ultimately develop their own “businesses” or non-profits and become social entrepreneurs.
The MAD Initiative workshops have been run privately in the Hudson Valley and through the organization Girls, Inc. in New York City.

<p> </p></div>","The Play – Presented by Moyo Theatre in Association with GromKat Productions
 
Tainted  tells the story of the Steele family and their fight to stay intact when the unimaginable happens. Set against the backdrop of the devastating tainted blood crisis, Tainted is a story about love, grief, justice, and the enduring power of forgiveness. 
 
Tainted will run from September 26th to October 12th at the new premier arts venue in Toronto, The Aki Studio Theatre, Daniels Spectrum. We have brought together a stellar cast and design team under the direction of multi-Dora-winning director Vikki Anderson. 
 
Moyo Theatre’s Mandate
 
Moyo Theatre’s mandate is to present theatre with a fearless heart. We have come together to create Tainted as there is an immediate need for this story to be told. 
We believe it is our obligation and our privilege to stand behind this story to ensure that the voices of the people who were so deeply affected by the tainted blood crisis continue to clamor. We believe that the truth must never be forgotten. We believe that one of the only ways to ensure catastrophes like the tainted blood crisis do not happen again is by creating a living testament to the real cost of this tragedy.
The funds we raise will go directly to the launch and costs of our Toronto production and will further our efforts in getting Tainted performed across the country as well as in the US and UK!
 
The True Story
The tainted blood crisis has spanned 30 years and infected over 30,000 Canadians of all ages and ethnicities with hepatitis C and HIV – many of those infections could have been prevented. It has wiped out almost an entire generation of hemophiliacs dependent on blood-clotting product to save them from life threatening bleeds. In the early '80s when HIV was a new blood-borne disease, the Red Cross, Health Canada and our government did not take the precautions necessary to protect the blood supply. Thousands of people were infected via blood transfusions. The effects were catastrophic. 
Our government is paying out billions of dollars in compensation to those affected. But compensation and acknowledgment of government failings was hard won and it came at an incredible cost to Canadian families. Those infected lobbied for years in order to attain a public inquiry into how the system failed them. They struggled financially, emotionally, and physically trying to stay alive during the height of AIDS, when life-saving treatment was not available.  What many people don’t realize is that hemophilia is a disease inherited genetically. For many Canadian families the loss was compounded by losing more than one son (hemophilia usually occurs in males). Moreover, people who were exposed to tainted blood were often not informed for years. Many unknowingly passed on the diseases to their spouses and unborn children. 
The Impact – The Urgency
In the federal inquiry into how our blood supply was contaminated, the legendary judge, Justice Krever recommended not to allow paid compensation for blood donation so as to ensure the future safety of the Canadian blood supply.
After millions of dollars has been spent creating a new and safe blood system it is now more crucial than ever for this story to be told. In the past, one of the reasons so much tainted blood was received was that it was purchased from the United States, who was sourcing it from paid-donor programs in prisons, skid rows, and neighbourhoods that attracted equally high-risk donors. A similar scenario is currently being proposed in Canada. In Toronto and Hamilton private collection clinics have already been set up - ready to open their doors to pay people for their plasma. One is beside a homeless shelter, another beside a methadone clinic. This has major implications for the safety of our blood supply and our voluntary system. 
Our play shines light on the vital role we share in preventing tragedies like the tainted blood crisis from recurring. We must not make the same mistakes again. 
Make sure this story is told! Make sure their voices are never forgotten. 
Our deepest gratitude.

<h3>interCulture casting &amp; management is the brain-child of respected actor, director &amp; producer Michael Turkic and talented writer, media consultant and analyst William Uy Vu Le</h3>
<p>Since 1981, <em><strong>Michael Turkic</strong> </em>has been appeared in or directed some of the largest commercial stage productions in Australia. An original Australian cast member of the international hit, Les Miserables, Michael has since 1985 worked at the top of his profession. His credits as either actor and/or director include: Company (Sydney Theatre Company) Les Miserables (Cameron Mackintosh) Chess (Theatre Royal Sydney) The Secret Garden (State Theatre Sydney) Grease The Arena Spectacular, Tim Rice's Concert Spectacular, Happy Days The Mega Musical, as well as projects for ABC TV. He was a regular featured actor in the children;s TV series Ship To Shore as well as Andrew Denton's The Money Or The Gun. A respected educator, he has lectured at the National Institute of Dramatic Art, West Australian Academy Of Performing Arts, and the Central Queensland Conservatorium of Music.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><em><strong>William Uy Vu Le</strong></em> is a writer with extensive experience in film, television, literature and media, particularly in the Asia Pacific rim. He worked for Persuasive Networks in HK and specialised in content aggregation, planning, forecasting and social media. He assisted with market research, branding, scheduling, acquisitions and co-production of two luxury lifestyle and educational channels in Asia-Pacific Pay TV market.</p>
<p>He also was strategy advisor to the direction of a full-service digital media agency. He assisted with 360-degree video content management solutions (CMS), convergence technologies and distribution needs in multi-platform or IPTV products.</p>
<p>William is well connected to the Vietnamese community and to key demographics of Australia and as such brings a wealth of talent identification and credibility to the business.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>interCulture casting &amp; management is in the start-up phase. Australia has approximately 47% of its population from a non Anglo Saxon background. This is currently not represented in the main-stream media, on stage, or in the web space insofar as it emanates from this country. Our business will represent and market actors, singers, dancers, choreographers, presenters, spokespeople, models and skilled artists from the diasporas of Asia, The Middle East, Middle Europe, the sub-continent, Pacific Islands and beyond.</p>
<p>Our model is to not only divide the business into both casting for feature film, TV, stage, event, corporate training, single projects, festivals and the like, but also to represent and manage the careers of up and coming artists, and artists with promise whose current management is not adding value.</p>
<p>We need $15,000 to open the business and have the following infrastructure in place:</p>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>Website</li>
<li>Social Media</li>
<li>Team</li>
<li>Equipment</li>
<li>Office Space (Surry Hills, artistic hub of Sydney)</li>
<li>Business relationships</li>
<li>Customer Database</li>
<li>Venture Partners</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>

<ul>
<li>Help us create the first NON ANGLO SAXON ARTISTS AGENCY IN AUSTRALIA</li>
<li>Be part of one of the most progressive multi-cultural high visibility businesses yet conceived.</li>
<li>By assisting us in start up mode, you will have the pleasure and satisfaction of seeing the incremental change to the way Media progesses to a fully representational model of Australia's multicultural society.</li>

<h3>The Show</h3>
<p><i>Alice in Wonderland,</i> based on the novels by Lewis Carroll, was originally adapted by André Gregory and the Manhattan Project in 1970. Lending itself to a six person cast, Wonderland is created through the use of comedy and the search for humanity behind Carroll's characters. Alice explores Wonderland as a young girl begging the question, ""Who am I?"" and matures as she encounters its inhabitants and grows to learn that Wonderland has its own shadows. </p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Funding a project of this scale is no simple task! Financial support is a necessity in making the director's vision come to fruition and in publicizing this incredible show. Your donation OF ANY SIZE will go toward</p>
<ul>
<li>Buying lumber, plywood, and paint to build our set</li>
<li>Purchasing clothing from thrift shops, rental stores, and consigment shops to dress our actors</li>
<li>Acquiring props from rental markets, thrift stores, and the like</li>
<li>Renting sound and lighting equipment</li>
<li>Advertising all around campus and the Chicagoland area</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Women are a large majority of the individual involved in theatre. However, their voices are not the majority voices - they are not an equal voice. The number of male roles are significantly higher than female roles. While Lipstick does not shy away from casting men in their shows, they make an honest effort to choose plays that showcase a larger number of the talented women at their disposal.</p>

As part of the process of creating and performing our multi-disciplinary revisitation it has been rewarding to share ""the book"" with younger cast members, as well as with audience members who hadn't previously encountered it. </span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Revisiting the artists and ideas from this book and their relationship to the
current political moment has enhanced all of our understandings of what a feminist/activist/artist looks like, and some of the issues that still need to be addressed. Our sold-out work-in-progress performance (at Dixon Place's HOT! Festival in July) sparked rich conversations and responses from our audience. We aspire for our full length performance of <i>Angry Women REvisited</i> to provoke even more. We consider this performance to be in reverence of the artists in the book, a</span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""> celebration of not settling for the world we live in, a pushing of the boundaries of multi-disciplinary performance, and an example of what it might look like if we define things in our own, sometimes very contradictory, terms.Your contribution will directly impact our ability to present this material as a live performance and to have the performance documented professionally.</span></p><h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3><p>If you don't have the cold hard cash, here are some other ways you can help:</p><ul>

We want all of our hard work to be fully realized and documented professionally. Donate at the $200 level and sponsor a support service for our performance directly. Professional videography and photography will benefit each and every cast member when we further our professional and artistic project portfolios after the show. 
Every dollars counts--$1, $5, $10, $20, bring it on!!Our FootprintsIn the early 1990s, when I was an angry, queer, feminist youngster, my encounters with the book Angry Women profoundly shaped my sense of possibilities for making dynamic and world-changing performance. I loved this publication as a twenty-something and returning to it with more life experience under my belt has been invigorating, inspiring, at times challenging, and overall just as juicy as the first time. As part of the process of creating and performing our multi-disciplinary revisitation it has been rewarding to share ""the book"" with younger cast members, as well as with audience members who hadn't previously encountered it. Revisiting the artists and ideas from this book and their relationship to the
current political moment has enhanced all of our understandings of what a feminist/activist/artist looks like, and some of the issues that still need to be addressed. Our sold-out work-in-progress performance (at Dixon Place's HOT! Festival in July) sparked rich conversations and responses from our audience. We aspire for our full length performance of Angry Women REvisited to provoke even more. We consider this performance to be in reverence of the artists in the book, a celebration of not settling for the world we live in, a pushing of the boundaries of multi-disciplinary performance, and an example of what it might look like if we define things in our own, sometimes very contradictory, terms.Your contribution will directly impact our ability to present this material as a live performance and to have the performance documented professionally.Other Ways You Can HelpIf you don't have the cold hard cash, here are some other ways you can help:
Donate your services to us. We are seeking in-kind support staff for professional sound mixing, photography shoot, videography, stage manager, and lighting design.
Spread the word about this show and about our campaign. Please post as far and wide as your imagination allows! Use the Indiegogo share tools.

Volunteer for our show. We need ushers, strikers and floor painters on Sunday night, and publicity volunteers. All volunteers will receive a complimentary ticket to the show in exchange for their help. Contact jdellecave@hotmail.com for more information, please put Angry Women Volunteer in the subject line. 
Keep checking back, as we will continue to post new photos/videos from our upcoming rehearsals. Maybe even a sneak peek of the show!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h2>BARE</h2>
<p>A contemporary rock musical, <i>BARE</i> follows a group of teens wrestling with identity, sexuality, and religion at a co-ed Catholic boarding school. </p>
<p>Provocative and raw, <i>BARE</i> is unyielding in its exploration of how our generation navigates the tightrope between adolescence and adulthood. Our production will explore what it means to wear a mask through life, how these facades alter our identities, and ultimately how far we are willing to go to compromise our sense of self in order to maintain the validity of our masks and fit into society’s prescriptive norms.</p>
<p>When our story gives these young adults the choice whether or not to reveal the turmoil underneath their masks, their decision to keep others out or lay themselves ""bare"" will not only alter the course of their lives, but leave everyone changed forever.</p>
<h3>The Team</h3>
<p><b>Cast</b>: Sam Shankman, Eric Peters, Sara Kase, Tessa Dettman, Alex Christ, Lindsey Olson, Dan Stromfeld, Rosie Chandler, Frankie Leo Bennett, Adhana Reid, Daniel Liu, Jessie Jennison, Chris Paul, Jason Dillion </p>

Provocative and raw, BARE is unyielding in its exploration of how our generation navigates the tightrope between adolescence and adulthood. Our production will explore what it means to wear a mask through life, how these facades alter our identities, and ultimately how far we are willing to go to compromise our sense of self in order to maintain the validity of our masks and fit into society’s prescriptive norms.
When our story gives these young adults the choice whether or not to reveal the turmoil underneath their masks, their decision to keep others out or lay themselves ""bare"" will not only alter the course of their lives, but leave everyone changed forever.

The Impact
Your generous donation will allow this project to become a reality in many ways. 


Set: The set design will transform our performance space into a church, complete with pews and stained-glass windows. Funds will go towards buying lumber, paint, and tools. 

Lights: To light the actors and to create special effects, funds will go towards renting and purchasing lights and lighting equipment.

Costume and Props: Funds will allow us to purchase and construct costumes for our 14-person cast as well as props.

Publicity: For the production to have the greatest impact possible, funds will be used to publicize our event across campus and the Evanston community with materials such as posters, programs, and promotional videos. 

Outreach: This production and Spectrum Theatre Company are committed to  making a positive impact on the community through meaningful theatre. Donations will allow us to organize community events such as workshops in local high schools and talkbacks and post-show events surrounding the theme of the show.

important because it means more fair job opportunities for artists, as

usually enjoy theatre.  We as a company pick nontraditional shows.  Our 
target is young adults ages 16 to 35, which is also the market thats

help fix that by exposing people to something different, and our next

profits will get directly donated to ""Hope House"" as well.  Hope House 
is an organization that houses specifically young people and families in
 crisis with abuse, neglect, as well as all other people in our society 
who are seen as abandoned.  Hope House is in the same town as our 
performance, and the members of the recovery programs there will get 
free tickets, as well as the staff.  So, that being said, support from our 
fundraiser campaign is critical in making all this happen well.<br/><br/>In 2013, we produced the New York premiere of Night of the Living Dead 
on stage for the Performing Arts Studio in Port Jefferson, NY.  We've

father's trailer on the Texas-Mexico border. 
There he finds his father Marcus, living with Ro—his much younger
live-in girlfriend.  And when a spark of
interest lights between Julian and Ro, old tensions seethe between father and
son, drawing Julian's brutal past to the surface.  A modern Western, at its heart ""Devil Lay Me

</div></div>","Devil Lay Me Down

""Devil Lay Me Down"" is a new play by Ean Miles Kessler, and will premiere at Theater for the New City, with the Dream Up Festival in August.  We've got an incredible team working on this project--with Stephen D'Ambrose, Mara Gannon, and Joe Williamson starring, David Delaney directing. and Glenn Quentin producing--and we're thrilled to be working with such an incredible venue and festival.



But we need your help.  There are dozens of costs in making a play a reality--from rehearsal space, to props and costumes, to paying all of our talented collaborators--and in order to bring this piece to life, we are looking to raise $5,000.  We're offering a whole bunch of perks for helping us out, including signed
memorabilia from the show, Haikus written by the Devil himself, invites to the
cast party after the final show, shout-outs for your own personal projects, and
much more.  Any help you can offer is tremendously appreciated.




The Play Itself...

""Devil
Lay Me Down"" centers on Julian Carthy, as he returns from prison to his
father's trailer on the Texas-Mexico border. 
There he finds his father Marcus, living with Ro—his much younger
live-in girlfriend.  And when a spark of
interest lights between Julian and Ro, old tensions seethe between father and
son, drawing Julian's brutal past to the surface.  A modern Western, at its heart ""Devil Lay Me
Down"" is a brutal love story, and love song to the American West.


Our Goals...

This is a workshop production, and our aim is to make it fairly bare-bones, so as to minimize costs, and any contribution you can give will help to make this show a reality.  No amount is too small, and everything is much appreciated.  This piece began as a through-line in another play that we produced in 2012, called ""King's River.""  If you helped with that fundraising campaign, we cannot thank you enough.  Now, we're trying to do the same thing for ""Devil.""  Fortunately, our monetary goal is much smaller this time--$5,000, a fraction of what ""King's River"" cost.  You'll be helping us build a new play, one that we've been working on for over 2 years now.  This piece has finally reached the next step in its gestation, and it needs to be put up on it's legs in front of an audience.  This campaign will help do that.

We want to get as much notice as we can for all of the artists we have collaborating with us on this project.  We're tremendously proud of all the work that they've done, and it's very important to us that they be recognized for all of their dedication.  Our hope is that this workshop production will lead to other extended productions in the near-future, and we want everyone affiliated with this play to grow and benefit from this experience.  But most of all, we want to put on a great show.  We hope you can help with this venture.

<p><a href=""http://www.fringesanmiguel.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Fringe Festival San Miguel de Allende</a> (October 11-19) is a celebration of the performing arts in multiple languages and venues in this historic, cosmopolitan city. In addition to a thrilling array of performances we will also offer workshops in acting, voice, movement, stage fighting, playwriting and more.</p>
<p>In Edinburgh, where Fringe began in 1947, the Festival Fringe is now the largest arts festival in the world, and includes over 2000 shows every year in 300 venues. The population of the city doubles during the festival. Fringe festivals have popped up in many cities around the world - New York, Avignon, Prague, Toronto, New Orleans - but this will be the first Fringe festival in Spanish-speaking Latin America.<br/><br/>To date, we have received 45 performance submissions from Mexico (DF, Guanajuato, Querétaro, Mérida, Hermosillo, Guadalajara), Spain, Great Britain, Costa Rica, the US (LA, NYC) and Canada (Montreal) in the categories of drama, thriller, comedy, cabaret, performance collage, stand-up, farce, children's theatre, dance, puppetry, improv and more. We have also invited several outstanding solo artists and groups, some of whom performed to great acclaim in our first small theatre festival held in San Miguel de Allende in August 2012 (<em>Encuentro de Teatro San Miguel</em>).<br/><br/><strong>Why San Miguel de Allende?</strong><br/><br/>San Miguel de Allende is a top destination for tourists from all over the world and this vibrant city has a colorful history as an artistic and culturally diverse community. English and Spanish, Latin and Anglo, ancient and modern all mingle here. In this beguiling atmosphere of cultural schizophrenia, the Fringe Festival SMA will make itself at home by bringing fresh entertainment and insights to the beautiful town’s theatres, cafés, restaurants, bars and streets. The Fringe Festival SMA will be accessible and inclusive to a broad audience and will attract visitors from other cities to stay in our city's hotels, eat in our restaurants, shop in our stores and markets.<br/><br/>Mexico is home to many innovative playwrights, actors, dancers and other performers and we hope that Fringe Festival SMA becomes an annual pilgrimage for them, a chance to try something new, test their boundaries, expand their horizons and interact with others in their field.<br/><br/><strong>Why we need your help</strong></p>
<p>We have been so inspired by the eager response to this festival on the part of the performing arts community here in Mexico and beyond. They are hungry for it. We have also been impressed by the quality of their work and the possibilities it represents for not only this inaugural festival, but for years to come. <br/><br/>Our only limitation is funding. We are working with artists to help them make the trip to SMA; as this is our first year, we are trying to be generous to encourage the best performers and instructors to participate. This means we will need to help cover some transportation costs, lodging and per diem. <br/><br/>Ticket prices will be kept low and the income will be shared with the artists (after paying the venue). Ticket sales will never cover our budget, which also includes administrative costs, print and digital advertising, and those thousand little costs you don't expect. One of our favorite quotes about the theatre business sums it up: ""The natural condition is one of insurmountable obstacles on the road to imminent disaster."" Need we say more? We need your help!<br/><br/>We have come up with some exciting perks to express our gratitude for your contribution (named after <em>lucha libre</em> wrestlers, our mascots). But your support - at any level - for launching this new cultural experience in San Miguel and Mexico is truly a priceless gift.<br/><br/><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></p>

 is an administrative assistant at Scrooge Industries in modern-day San 
Francisco. When three colorful and quirky ghosts visit her on Christmas 
Eve (including The Ghost of Christmas Breaks and The Ghost of Christmas 
Bonuses), Carole embarks on a wild yuletide adventure... but can she 
change things at the office, cheer up her humbug boss, and catch the 
holiday spirit in time for Christmas dinner?! Find out in this World 
Premiere play brought to you by the Thrillride Mechanics — the creative team that wowed Bay Area audiences with last summer’s all-ages hit WUNDERWORLD. Featuring broad physical comedy, innovative puppetry, unforgettable characters, and outrageous costumes, It’s Christmas, Carole! is a 50-minute holiday comedy for all families, all cultures, and all ages.

Who We Are:

The Thrillride Mechanics are San Francisco's very own Theater of Human Animation in residence at the beautiful Creativity Theater in Yerba Buena Gardens. Our mission is to tell stories onstage that are universally entertaining for children and adults and promote acceptance, empathy, and positive change. After the success of our flagship production WUNDERWORLD, our friends at the Children’s Creativity Museum asked us to come back in December with a new take on a beloved holiday classic. Like WUNDERWORLD, we wanted to do something a little different with this particular tale, something that updated the story for the modern family audience by including ALL holidays & cultures, plus plenty of our signature comic twists and turns. The result is It's Christmas, Carole! and we need YOUR help to make it happen!
By donating to our IndieGoGo campaign you become an integral part of bringing It’s Christmas, Carole!
 to the Children’s Creativity Museum this holiday season. As an 
independent producing company, we rely on the generous support of donors
 like you to bring new theater to life. We’ve got a tremendous community of performers, artists, 
designers, and technicians contributing their talents to this 
show. Your donations go directly to the independent artists who are building this new work. Any amount you can contribute will keep this community thriving and ensure that our show looks, sounds, and feels like the 
holiday hit we know it can be. We need your help, and we promise you won't be disappointed with the results!

What We Need:
The
 Thrillride Mechanics make miracles happen with a small amount of cash. We’ve done it before and we’ll do it again! Our $5,000 budget will help 
us pay for all of these things and more:

Costumes (materials, design, construction)
Sound Design (music, sound effects, microphones)
Lighting Design (animated effects & colors)
Website & Publicity Materials (domain & web hosting, photography, press packets)
Director, Stage Manager & Actor Rehearsal Stipends

We
 love paying good people good money for their time and talents, and for 
that we need a little help. Our fundraising goal of $5,000 is the 
minimum we’d like to raise and any additional funding means 
additional pay to all of these wonderful artists. Your
contribution will help the entire It’s Christmas, Carole! community bring you a World Premiere that will surprise and delight!

What You Get:
Besides the thrill of bringing new theater to life, your donation may get you a fun keepsake or two. We've got:

Signed It’s Christmas, Carole! memorabilia!
Exclusive Carole Art! Collect it all!
Carole Soundtracks! Rock out to the weirdest Christmas songs ever recorded!
Tickets to the Show!

And
 if we meet our goal we’ll have even more ways to show our appreciation 
to you, our generous benefactors. We promise it will be worth the 
investment! Every cent counts so please consider contributing whatever 
you can!

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hello Gracious Contributors,</p>
<p>  My name is Jamison Monella and I am recent graduate of Juniata College with a Bachelor's Degree in Theatre Performance and Art History. I have been acting since I was 9 years old and theater is not only my greatest passion in this life, but it is also one of the most essential pillars in human history as a whole. Without having an open and free space to explore the expansive issues of our society at large -- then we would never have been able to move forward.</p>
<p>  This moving forward is something I have experienced quite recently, as I left the comfort of my home in Pennsylvania and moved to New York City. The impetus behind my move was of course: theater. Mid-semester I was excited to accept two opportunities. The first being to perform in a production called Drones in the Planet Connections Theater Festivity. This production will be closing on July 9th and has made a fantastic run and had a warm reception. The second opportunity is the reason  you are reading the words on this webpage. In just under a month, on August 2 2016, I will be flying to Edinburgh, Scotland to perform as Hamlet in the largest theater festival of its kind in the entire world: The International Edinburgh Fringe Festival. At this particular festivity, the entire city is virtually converted into a performance space. Artists from all over the globe gather to perform, share their stories, and to network in one the most beautiful countries.</p>
<p>  Fortunately, the plane tickets and accommodations have been taken care of by an anonymous donor. However, assistance at this point in time is still needed. I have a day job working at Classic Harbor Line at Chelsea Piers and am also seeking a second job. Although I do have a source of income, this trip --which is inherently career enhancing -- may not be able to happen without your help. I am seeking funds to help pay for the sublets that I am currently living in, for food while I am on my trip, and for travel to and from the airports.</p>
<p>  If you can find the kindness and love to help out this starving artist, I would be eternally grateful. There is nothing more important to me than my career, and after a life dreaming of becoming a professional actor I can now say that I am living that dream. Thank you for reading and I hope to hear from you soon.</p>

<p>We are thrilled to announce that dNaga
has been invited to perform at this year’s World Parkinson Congress from September 20 to 23, 2016, in Portland, Oregon. There will be about 4000 attendees from all over the world at the Congress including researchers, medical professionals, people with
Parkinson’s, their families and caregivers. <br/></p>
<p>dNaga is an intergenerational dance
company based in Oakland, California that includes adult dancers with
Parkinson’s disease performing with high school dancers. We are an extension of
the Dance for PD® program that began in 2001 at the Mark Morris Dance Group in
Brooklyn. dNaga director and choreographer Claudine Naganuma has been offering
Dance for PD®<span>  classes in Oakland
since 2007. Claudine is featured in Dave Iverson’s documentary about the dance
program, “Capturing Grace”.</span></p>
<p>Our work is entitled <i>Proteinology </i>and it is inspired by the recent discovery of the misfolding protein. Our newest section, ""Ode to the Sticky Protein and Momentary Lapses of Escapism"" is performed to the music of the fantastic Portland group Pink Martini.</p>
<p>Collaborators and audience alike are inspired
by the courage and grace of our dancers. For those with Parkinson’s disease,
dancing provides an opportunity to creatively express and share the private
struggles of living with PD. For our young dancers, the unique experience of
working with dancers with PD is a precious opportunity to form bonds across the
generations while creating art together.</p>
<p>Our collaborative choreography, from
whimsy to solemn and back again, features personal narratives, current PD research,
original sound scores, symbols, poetry and myth, all around the theme of living
with Parkinson’s disease.</p>
<p></p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>
</p>
<p>We are seeking funding to cover the
costs of this project: In particular, we need to pay for flights and housing
for our 10 member company, 5 dancers with Parkinson’s disease and 5
adults/youth will be traveling with our director, composer, stage manager and lighting designer!</p>
<p>As a supporter of dNaga’s World
Parkinson’s Congress adventure, you will be associated with the cutting edge concept
that exercise, and in particular, dance, provides relief for many PD sufferers.
While a cure has yet to be found, dance brings movement, joy and community to
those with this affliction. </p>
<p>Unless you prefer to remain anonymous,
contributors’ names will be printed in the WPC program, projected on the
backdrop of the stage during the performances at the WPC and listed on dNaga’s
website.</p>
<ul></ul> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p></p>
<p>Your contribution will help us get to
Portland and pay for housing (which is VERY EXPENSIVE!)<span>  Our lighting designer (of two decades)
will be travelling from Texas and our composer (also of two decades) will be
bringing his MARIMBA LUMINA! (Buchla instrument). We also plan on having new
costumes made!</span></p>
<p>dNaga’s dancers have been creating and
performing since 2001. We have presented work annually at Laney College
Theater in Oakland, at Danspace in Oakland (our home studio), Z Space and SomARTS Cultural
Center in San Francisco, Tapestry at the Mormon Temple Auditorium in Oakland, and
several site specific dances. dNaga’s work has also been performed at the Mark
Morris Dance Center in Brooklyn and the Mulberry Street Theater in New York
City.</p>
<p>Our dancers, those with Parkinson’s as
well as our youth dancers, are dedicated, hardworking and aware of the profound
meaning of the dance, the process, the community we are creating and its
message to those with Parkinson’s, their families, caregivers, researchers and
medical professionals</p> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p> </p>
<p>For people with Parkinson’s, every day
is a challenge. We live with tremors, unruly limbs, rigidity, extreme fatigue,
balance issues, muscle and joint pains, and sometimes cognitive impairment. Despite this, we are devoted to the work
we are creating and presenting. Most of us are either not working any longer or
are “semi-retired”. This is why we need your help to fulfill this golden
opportunity to perform at the 2016 World Parkinson’s Congress.</p>
<p>Failure to reach our fundraising goals
would have a huge impact on our performance and presence at the World Parkinson Congress. Burdened by medical costs, our dancers are not able to finance the
project independently. Without your support, we will have to re-choreograph and
adjust so that fewer dancers will be involved. Scaling down our production would
put a huge damper on our ability to connect with attendees and share our
stories. </p>
<p>You may be wondering why we have such
an early deadline! Coordinating housing, transport and other logistics for our
dancers and collaborators requires early reservations and planning. Delays in
the process will increase costs and create larger hurdles beyond what we
already face.</p>
<p>Help us create a successful performance
at the World Parkinson Congress! Having all of our dancers onstage, opening
their hearts to the audience and connecting with others in the same predicament
will have an immeasurable benefit.</p> </div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Please help us spread the word to those
who might be financially able to support us. Tag and share this campaign on
social media. Send us your story of living with Parkinson’s disease.</p>
<p>Use Indiegogo share tools.</p>

meaning of the dance, the process, the community we are creating and its
message to those with Parkinson’s, their families, caregivers, researchers and
medical professionals   Risks & Challenges  
For people with Parkinson’s, every day
is a challenge. We live with tremors, unruly limbs, rigidity, extreme fatigue,
balance issues, muscle and joint pains, and sometimes cognitive impairment. Despite this, we are devoted to the work
we are creating and presenting. Most of us are either not working any longer or
are “semi-retired”. This is why we need your help to fulfill this golden
opportunity to perform at the 2016 World Parkinson’s Congress.
Failure to reach our fundraising goals
would have a huge impact on our performance and presence at the World Parkinson Congress. Burdened by medical costs, our dancers are not able to finance the
project independently. Without your support, we will have to re-choreograph and
adjust so that fewer dancers will be involved. Scaling down our production would
put a huge damper on our ability to connect with attendees and share our
stories. 
You may be wondering why we have such
an early deadline! Coordinating housing, transport and other logistics for our
dancers and collaborators requires early reservations and planning. Delays in
the process will increase costs and create larger hurdles beyond what we
already face.
Help us create a successful performance
at the World Parkinson Congress! Having all of our dancers onstage, opening
their hearts to the audience and connecting with others in the same predicament
will have an immeasurable benefit.   Other Ways You Can Help
Please help us spread the word to those
who might be financially able to support us. Tag and share this campaign on
social media. Send us your story of living with Parkinson’s disease.

<h3>About The Show</h3>
<p>THE HUMMM explores the soundscape of Chekhov’s Three Sisters and short stories.  Based on the belief that vibration carries meaning, our team uses sound as the driving force to unpack the subtlety and musicality of Chekhov’s most lonely women. Featuring four actresses, the show is set in a post-apocalyptic future where all the military men have died and only the women remain. Haunted by fading memories and the voices of their past loves, these women must find a way to survive on their own. Humming, whining, whispering, and clamoring — we wrap the audience in a  ‘Chekhovian polyphony,’ where the chords are made of ecstasy, anguish, and perpetual disillusion. Incorporating a wide range of music and media, and intensified by stylistic choreography and a live DJ, The Hummm creates an unprecedented aural and visual experience of the Three Sisters.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Who We Are</h3>
<p>All of our core collaborators recently graduated from the A.R.T. Institute at Harvard University. United by our shared artistic vocabulary and inspired by our studies in both Russia and Poland, we have come together to make current, wild, and inventive theatre.  We love this project almost as much as we love each other!</p>

<h3>Impact</h3>
<p><i>“Our business is to work and go on working, and our distant descendants will have any happiness that’s going.  I won’t have it, but my children’s children may.”  -Vershinin in Chekhov’s Three Sisters</i></p>
<p>While our team always intended to draw parallels between Chekhov’s turn-of-the-20<sup>th</sup>-century text and our own contemporary truths, igniting this discussion now feels more urgent. We have been particularly called to action by the 2016 presidential campaign; to ignore its outcome seems untruthful, and quite frankly, impossible.</p>
<p>Chekhov’s play poses essential questions about the consequences of inaction, and the challenge of moving forward in the face of hopelessness. We are more inspired than ever to explore his universal images and themes, and we hope you’ll join us in turning this social art to social act.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Nic Adams and I make poetry and theatre. For the last five years, I’ve been working as a stage manager and assistant director, mostly on experimental productions in New York City. But for the last five years, I’ve also been presenting productions of my own theatre at smaller venues.</p>
<p>My upcoming show, <i>Icarus in the L.E.S.,</i> is a kaleidoscopic performance-poem delivered from the final bastions of the New York vanguard. The performance centers on the wax-winged hero – who did not die when he fell from the sky, but instead lives on – chasing his destiny and scouting out the divide between artistic achievement and personal happiness. Presented as a teched-out poetry reading, and brimming with sound and video design culled from the most psychically-charged bits of city living, the poem is performed by the soulful and unendingly charismatic Ronald Peet.</p>
<p>I am asking for your help to raise $500 towards funding this project. <i>Icarus</i> has been the recipient of many hours of free labor and thoughtful play given to me by performers, directors, and writers. Over the past few years, I have paid out of pocket for rehearsal space, costumes, and glittery makeup. I have composed a rich soundscore from field recordings I’ve made in my free time. And I’ve built something I’m very proud of out of these donations of time and thought! Now, however, I am attempting to craft <i>Icarus</i> into a repeatable, enjoyable work of live performance with an actor, Ronald Peet, scenery, lights, sound, and video and all of that takes time, money, and skill to create. I must now ask for your support to get me over this final hurdle.</p>
<p>This production represents a big transition in my career as an artist. For years I have been helping others as an assistant or stage manager to create their own astonishing, progressive, lively, and fun pieces of live performance. Getting the chance to produce <i>Icarus</i> at this level for an audience of artists I deeply admire means the world to me, and cannot happen without your help.</p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>$500 is the fund I am asking this crowd to raise. This amount represents half of my costs for this show. This money is dedicated to paying the performer, shopping for and building the scenery of this play (<i>Icarus</i> is set in-between the aisles of a bodega – replete with an old TV, dried goods, and Bustelo coffee cans), paying for rehearsal space (always a really big expense), and boring-but-important things like printing, transportation, and contingency.</p>
<p>Starting at just $15, the perks for this show are one-of-a-kind, ranging from a high-quality show poster signed and numbered by the artist, to a handmade chapbook of the poem, signed by me. For higher-level donations, we’re offering a CD or digital download of the show with the original soundscore, and, at the highest level, I will come perform <i>Icarus in the L.E.S.</i> in its entirety at your home for a crowd of up to 20.</p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Without getting too hokey, I love poetry. Like most people, I began reading poetry and remember feeling embarrassed at the language. It was too big, too grand. I didn’t have the words for the way I felt, but poetry did. Or it got closer. And I was jealous. As I continued reading poetry, I realized it wasn’t all big and grand. Some poetry was goofy, some was romantic. Some couldn’t be categorized as easily, but felt true. All of a sudden, I realized poetry gave me more words for the way I felt. I want to share that experience with others, and I think, mostly, it comes from creating a joyful live experience led by a mesmerizing performer. This is what I hope my performance-poetry can achieve. Your contribution to this campaign can help create a space and time for this experience.</p>
<p>I have been sharing my live poetry for a few years now at places like Small’s jazz club, Cloud City, Dixon Place, and other small venues. A consistent refrain I hear from my audiences is “I don’t think of myself as a poetry person, but your poetry was beautiful.” They also say that they didn’t think poetry could be so fun, funny, etc. and that mine was. This feedback leads me to believe that if people can be surprised by my poetry, they may return to it and others’ work to help them define their experiences.</p>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The biggest challenge facing this – or any production – is time and space. I need the time and space to create and rehearse a thoughtful experience that will achieve my goals. And luckily, I have some help. I have been invited to perform at the venue, JACK, at no cost to the production. The co-producing company for this production is a group called Brooklyn Gypsies that has an excellent track record of presenting sold-out live events dedicated to social issues, poetry, and a kickass time. They will help offset the costs of marketing, promotion, venue rental, and insurance. But this will only get me part of the way there. I need your donations to help myself and the performer shape the poem into its most potent form, and there’s no better way to prepare for that other than renting a rehearsal room and picking apart the text.</p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you can’t donate, but are looking for a way to help, the best thing you can do is buy a ticket. Check out this website (<a href=""http://www.jackny.org/calendar.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.brownpapertickets.com/event/2729733</a>) for tickets.</p>

<p>Thank you so much for reading this far! I am so excited to share <i>Icarus in the L.E.S.</i> with you this winter!</p>

<p>Time: Arrive at 1900 for pre-show, show starts 2000<br/>Duration: 2 hours+<br/>Adapted and devised by 5toMidnight Singapore<br/>Supported by NAC MATCHBOX and Tote Board Arts Fund</p>
<h2>The Family</h2>
<p>5toMidnight is an international network of theater collectives that train under a single ethos. The collective has established branches in Indonesia and Taiwan, the maiden production of the Singapore branch is the first installment in a five- part series of Chekhov's major works adapted into a single, connected universe. </p>
<h2>The Show</h2>
<p>5toMidnight has taken a classic Russian play,and contextualized it for a Singaporean audience to examine how one man battles against the pressures of how difficult it is to be anything less than a model citizen in Singapore. Performed at what used to be the abandoned rooftop carpark of people's Park Complex, courtesy of Lepark, The Chekhov Cycle: Ivanov is a painful portrait of the struggle to survive in one of the most underrated venues of Singaporean nightlife. We've settled the logistical stuff, but we need your help to make sure we can eat!</p>
<p>This campaign is to raise funds to support the large, multiracial cast and creative team, and to offer opportunities for you, the audience, to engage in the creative process. We believe in community engagement in the creation of the work, while keeping prices as low as possible, to support large- scale, yet relevant work. Chekhov's major works have never been done in Singapore to the local taste, and in the local context, despite being a legendary playwright of the 20th century. <br/><br/>Come have a night out with us and then Lepark afterwards with the team!</p>
<h2>Come In</h2>
<h3>Contributions</h3>
<p>By contributing to this production, you will be supporting a diverse range of artists, offering them a fair wage and promoting a more tightly involved culture of creating theater that priorities an audience's cultural context, and social situation. You will be promoting theater in unconventional spaces, and challenging the definition of what is needed to create an immersive theatrical event.  </p>
</div><div>
<p>Even after receiving basic funding to cover production costs, this campaign's contributions will go directly to the people that make this show. For every ticket sold, $1.50 will go to each person involved in the production, so we can offer the tickets at cost price, essentially at a 10% discount of the retail price. In addition to that, crowdfunding allows us to offer you opportunities to work hands- on with the company from training with the director on the play itself, to watching the show being built, and even a souvenir for yourself to remember this event. </p>
<p>Whatever contributions we receive, big or small, will go directly to the actors (with the exception of the platform fee) so you will be directly paying the people you will see on stage with no one in between. <br/><br/>On top of getting to watch the show, these are some of the rewards you'll receive: Discounts, workshops, being a part of our rehearsals, a DVD and more! </p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Why Now?</h2>
<p>The team working on this production come from a variety of backgrounds to train together as theater makers in order to create a culture that is inclusive, and empathetic to each others' circumstances, and the world they live in with an audience. 5toMidnight strives for true intercultural exchange between its various branches in order to fight ignorance, violence, and discrimination. Chekhov was a humanitarian, and his plays reflect not just 20th century Russian Society, but also 21st century Singaporean society because we still face the same issues, therefore, in the interest of artistic equality, we want you to come and not just see the show, but to have a conversation with us about why Chekhov's stories can be, if not, are important to us.</p>
<p>Since the formation of 5toMidnight, we have embarked to Italy, Indonesia, and Taiwan to develop international collaborations and seed projects for the near future and for many years down the line. We have brought Singaporeans, Indonesians and Taiwanese together, worked together for international festivals, such as the Makassar International Writers' Festival (Indonesia), for the Farm 2016 international residencies in Italy, and at Robert Wilson's Watermill Center in New York. This is our first time doing a completely local project, grown and set in Singapore, and we hope that your support on this production will create a culture where the arts are beautiful, useful, and indispensable. </p>
<p>It is often said that there is no money in the arts. We don't believe that. If we can redefine what is enough for the artists to create high quality work for the audience to pay no more than they should, and come together to share an experience, then the arts stops being a high- class luxury activity and can return to what it felt like when our parents took us to watch wayang shows during festivals in our childhood. But as we have grown older, and become more ""educated"", and face realities of earning money, receiving a prestigious education, finding a job, owning a car, we risk losing the wonder of being a child living in a community. And why this can sound like a heartfelt speech, is because these are the barriers that the characters in the play grieve, celebrate, and fight about.</p>
<h2>Go On </h2>
<p>By contributing to this campaign, even if you choose none of the rewards available, you will get a ticket to watch the show, and we hope that that is enough of a gift from us to you for the time that you have spent clicking on the Facebook link, giving us your hard- earned money, coming to Chinatown, and partaking in a production that we've not only worked hard for, but thoroughly enjoyed creating for you. </p>

<p>The Negroes Are Congregating asks a lot of impolite questions about the ongoing effects of racism and how that ideology continues to exists in Canada and around the world.

The Negroes Are Congregating asks a lot of impolite questions about the ongoing effects of racism and how that ideology continues to exists in Canada and around the world. The Jamaican-Canadian writer, Natasha Adiyana Morris, infuses a taste of Toronto that incorporates accents, landmarks and a sort of local trivia often ignored by mainstream media. 
""Talking about race is exhausting and so I wanted to form my thoughts into live characters, displaying multiple sides of the race conversation. Some characters are full-on revolutionaries, others are complacent, there are parodies and plenty of satire but it ALL reflects uncomfortable truths.""
