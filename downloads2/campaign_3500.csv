<div>We are a group of 7 students from the College of Sustainability at Dalhousie University. We are a working group of The ENRICH Project (Environment Noxiousness, Racial Inequities and Community Health) spearheaded by Dr. Ingrid Waldron (Dalhousie School of Nursing) and a team comprised of Mi'kmaw and African Nova Scotian community members and activists, non-profit organizations, volunteer students and faculty/researchers. </div>
<div>We are currently in the process of organizing an art project, which will feature art contributed by Mi'kmaw and African Nova Scotian youth from around the province of Nova Scotia. The theme of the art project will depict the effects of Environmental Racism within their respective communities.</div>
<div>Environmental Racism is the the inequitable and disproportionate placement of toxic facilities and other environmental hazards near communities of colour and the working poor. Environmental racism also refers to the lack of democratic engagement of these communities in decision making about where these facilities are located.</div>
<div>If we are able to reach our goal of $500.00 it would assist the youth to purchase art supplies. Funds will also help pay for expenses incurred from ongoing outreach efforts to run this project.</div>
</div><div>
<p>Funds will be allocated for the purchase of arts supplies by youth who participate in this project. Funds will also be used for costs associated with travel to and outreach in Mi'kmaw and African Nova Scotian communities. Lastly, some of the funds will be used to rent space to house art displays submitted by youth for the Time to Clear the Air project.</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3> <p></p>
<p>Oppression which is systemically experienced by Mi'kmaw and African Nova Scotian communities is not an isolated issue, it occurs throughout
Canada and the rest of the world. Environmental racism is one example of systematic oppression. <i>Time to Clear the Air</i> and
the ENRICH project are hoping to help those who have been silenced by
environmental and toxic hazards in their community. Art has no barriers and helps
communicate significant messages across language, education and cultural
barriers and this is why we hope to receive help in facilitating art projects across
marginalized communities in Nova Scotia.  </p>

The end goal of this fundraising is to acquire my 200 Hour Hatha Yoga Teacher Certification from Yoga Alliance. With it, I will help others heal through movement, breath and art from symptoms of physical, mental, and emotional imbalances. Managing life depression, anxiety, addiction, etc. A regular Yoga practice will cultivate greater strength, flexibility, awareness, and inner peace.There’s only one catch; Yoga teacher training is expensive. Fortunately, with crowd funding this dream is now a reality. As I welcome abundance into my life, allow me to extend blessings back to you. Painting by Jeana Marino- ""Glory""What it coversYoga Teacher Training $2995.00Books and Reference Materials $150.009 months of Yoga Classes $355.00This painting is a piece from my energy series- Good Vibrations, ""Violets"" by Jeana MarinoIntentionBy deepening my practice and taking the leap to become a yoga teacher it will fulfill a natural state of being for me. I have always been passionate about counseling others to find what is possible for them. Through creativity, breath and movement we settle the mind as a collective and why not have some fun with it? We will dive into color and move into joy. :)Choose to make a difference for mind, body wellness through the beauty of art, movement and meditation. One of my favorite quotes is : “Don’t ask what the world needs. Ask what makes you come alive, and go do it. Because what the world needs is people who have come alive.”- Howard ThurmanAdvisorsFor the last 4 years, I practiced  with Jason Fischer, MA, LPC http://www.jasonbfischer.com/Jason is the founder/Clinical Director of Plumeria Counseling Center in Austin. His philosophy about counseling teaches individuals to become masters of their own emotional experience and then use this mastery toward the achievement of personal and interpersonal greatness.

Project Sketchbook is an annual sketchbook mail-out that culminates in an unjuried public exhibition. The venture began as the brainchild of Derrick Dent and the rest of the Rozelle Artists Guild gang as a way to engage the community around us. Every sketchbook turned into us is displayed in an open exhibition, and featured in our annual Project Sketchbook catalog. 

The project is simple: we (the lovely Rozellites) lovingly hand-cut and hand-stitch a whole mess of 16-page mini-sketchbooks. We mail/hand them out to whoever wants one, and they fill it up with whatever they want--pencil sketches, gouache paintings, grocery lists, public transit portraits, collaged magazine cut ups, rants about coffee prices--whatever you deem noteworthy. Some of our participants even turn the sketchbooks into delicate paper sculptures! 

Then we collect as many as we can wrangle, sit around picking our favorite pages from each, compiling them into a printed catalog, and put on a big exhibition with all of the books on display. There will be wine, snacks, catalogs for sale, live music by local musicians, and a whole gaggle of Memphis creatives cramming into a gallery. 
The event is always an interesting social experiment, but what we're really aiming to create is an atmosphere. This is a show where you can pick up the work, touch it, flip the pages, study the marks and read the notes, and that in itself makes it a personal experience. There is a sense of discovery that sets this show apart from the traditional art openings--you have no idea what will be lurking beneath that cover.


WHAT DO YOU NEED FROM ME?


In past endeavors, we have greatly underestimated the allure of this 
project--having to extend gallery hours to appease the throngs of 
attendees that populate the openings, and selling out of catalogs nearly
 instantaneously. This year, we're working on ways to be ready. A big 
part of that is funding. And that's where you can help!

Entry into Project Sketchbook is free. All the labor that goes into making it all happen is taken on by unpaid creatives. However, paper and galleries and postage are not free. Our goal of $2,000 will cover all the sketchbook materials, advertising & promotion, postage, gallery rental, exhibition costs and catalog printing.

Even if we do not raise the whole $2k, every dollar helps! We are thrifty, and through our five years of collaborative projects around Memphis, we have a good list of contacts to help us out. We will always find ways to get it done, but it's nearly impossible to get started without a little bank to help.



WHY IS PROJECT SKETCHBOOK IMPORTANT?

Project Sketchbook is one of our favorite events of the year because it best embodies what we as a guild hope to give to the community. Every year we have entrants who have never been in an exhibition, never seen their work in a gallery, and/or have never had their work published. Project Sketchbook gives any interested person these opportunities. The exhibition, while displaying the work of the artists, also serves as a networking event where the directors of art organizations, college students, bartenders, baristas, and muralists can mingle.

<span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-size: 16px; line-height: 26px; font-weight: normal;"">My name is Rachel Chase, a video, sound, and performance artist among other things. I have a B.F.A. in Studio Art from University of South Florida. As a teaching artist, I love to get kids excited about creativity. Currently, my outlet for this is teaching Dramatic Arts at <a href=""http://www.socprep.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Socrates Preparatory School</a> in Casselberry, Florida. I have recently been invited to create a performance art / video installation piece for the upcoming Creative City Project happening in Downtown Orlando, Florida, Saturday November 1, 2014. Please see <a href=""http://www.CreativeCityProject.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.CreativeCityProject.com</a> to feel the magnitude of this city-wide event. Other performers include Cirque de Soleil and many more large and small acts. </span><br/>
</h3>
<p>My Dramatic Arts class of fifteen children and I are currently in pre-production generating material for the sound, video, and shadow puppetry that will be part of our video installation piece. Included will also be live musical performance by one of the students who is a brilliant cellist, as well as me dancing and creating choreography to include members of the class as performers. Other class members who are not necessarily on stage performing are learning about running sound, lighting, and set installation. For a list of my artistic honors, please see below. Here's a video of one my performance art works for to enjoy (sound mix includes music by <a href=""http://www.radiantsol.com/blog/category/music/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Eluv</a> )  : <a href=""http://vimeo.com/32550890"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://vimeo.com/32550890</a></p>
<p>The site of our performance art / video installation piece, <i>Once Upon a Dream,</i> requires <b>installation of a large outdoor projection screen</b> in a 20'X20' circular area within a grouping of trees in Heritage Park on Central Ave, part of the <a href=""https://www.thehistorycenter.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Orange County Regional History Center.</a> Also, I require a good <b>sound recording microphone </b>to capture some of the pre-recorded sound we will use, <b>materials for costuming</b>, as well as <b>rigging to make the dramatic lighting and and video projections successful</b>.

<p>I am ecstatic to be a part of this amazing event, the <a href=""http://creativecityproject.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">3rd annual Creative City Project</a>. It is an honor to be invited, and exciting to be a part of the collaborative spirit of this event! Our assignments as producers for this event was to think in terms of collaborating with another group or entity that is not usual for us, to work with the audience in an unusual way, and to use the space creatively. I believe we are accomplishing this excellently. I am so grateful for all the brainstorming and visioning we've  been doing as well as the incredible support and encouragement from the school's President/Director, Faten Abdellah, as well as my immediate family. </p>
<p>Those of you who know my work know that I love to share and explore what's possible. Will you be a part of this with me? I promise to share lots of pics and videos of the making of this incredible performance art piece. The kids have never gotten to experience anything like this before, and I want them to see that they can create amazing things!</p>
<p>In addition to the satisfaction of contributing to the creative life of this performance, I will make a special thank you video art piece to inspire you and get it to you personally. You will receive a link to a video documentation of the live performance. </p>
<p>Thank you so much for your help at this crucial moment as we create a successful show on November 1st!</p>

</div></div>","My name is Rachel Chase, a video, sound, and performance artist among other things. I have a B.F.A. in Studio Art from University of South Florida. As a teaching artist, I love to get kids excited about creativity. Currently, my outlet for this is teaching Dramatic Arts at Socrates Preparatory School in Casselberry, Florida. I have recently been invited to create a performance art / video installation piece for the upcoming Creative City Project happening in Downtown Orlando, Florida, Saturday November 1, 2014. Please see www.CreativeCityProject.com to feel the magnitude of this city-wide event. Other performers include Cirque de Soleil and many more large and small acts. 

My Dramatic Arts class of fifteen children and I are currently in pre-production generating material for the sound, video, and shadow puppetry that will be part of our video installation piece. Included will also be live musical performance by one of the students who is a brilliant cellist, as well as me dancing and creating choreography to include members of the class as performers. Other class members who are not necessarily on stage performing are learning about running sound, lighting, and set installation. For a list of my artistic honors, please see below. Here's a video of one my performance art works for to enjoy (sound mix includes music by Eluv )  : http://vimeo.com/32550890
The site of our performance art / video installation piece, Once Upon a Dream, requires installation of a large outdoor projection screen in a 20'X20' circular area within a grouping of trees in Heritage Park on Central Ave, part of the Orange County Regional History Center. Also, I require a good sound recording microphone to capture some of the pre-recorded sound we will use, materials for costuming, as well as rigging to make the dramatic lighting and and video projections successful. This will run me around $500 to make it professional and successful. If I don't get the full amount, I will do the best I can with what we've got, but it won't ROCK the way I envision it truly can. I want it to be super successful so these kids have a fantastic experience, so the piece can really come to life, and for the audience to have a magical transcendent experience. Here's another video of one of my performance art / video pieces (a music video for Laura Escude) : CLICK this link for video: http://vimeo.com/32243540
I am ecstatic to be a part of this amazing event, the 3rd annual Creative City Project. It is an honor to be invited, and exciting to be a part of the collaborative spirit of this event! Our assignments as producers for this event was to think in terms of collaborating with another group or entity that is not usual for us, to work with the audience in an unusual way, and to use the space creatively. I believe we are accomplishing this excellently.

<p>I have a little hatchback Honda. I've never been attached to material possessions much. The one silk blouse I own was recently burned by a subletter.

<p>I am selling small and large paintings. Some are on stretched canvas. Some are on paper. Most are acrylic, some are oil. None are framed.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Create an understanding and a connection between the local island community, the visitors, the volunteers and the refugees.</p></li>
<li><p>Give locals, refugees and international participants the chance to demonstrate their talents and express themselves in a safe, non-judgemental and welcoming community.</p></li>
<li><p>Introduce international audiences to Lesvos: one of the Mediterranean’s architecturally, naturally and culturally richest islands.</p></li>
<li><p>Introduce new models of sustainable tourism that are best-matched to Lesvos’ position on the frontlines of the refugee crisis.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Why support the SYMBIOSIS Festival?</b></p>
<p>SYMBIOSIS is filling a gap – that is, the cultural integration of refugees. It is unique as it is an opportunity for refugees, locals and internationals to spend time together as equals and not in the context of supporter and person in need. It is a way of humanising the refugees and making the existing humanitarian crisis more sustainable by inviting them to become active participants in the cultural life of the island.</p>
<p><b>What is my donation going towards?</b></p>
<p>All artists have agreed to perform at SYMBIOSIS for free.</p>
<p>However, there are inevitable costs in organising such a big event. Here is what your donation will go towards:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Workshop design and delivery at the refugee camps</p></li>
<li><p>Transportation to and from the refugee camps and between remote villages</p></li>
<li><p>Sound and light engineering</p></li>
<li><p>Equipment rental</p></li>
<li><p>Accommodation &amp; food for our volunteers</p></li>
<li><p>Funding for administrative costs of an incorporated non-profit event</p></li>
</ul>
<p>We expect a great number of people to attend the festival over THE FULL MONTH OF PROGRAMMING. If everyone who attends donates <b>just $10</b> we will surely meet our fundraising goal! </p><p></p><p><b style=""background-color: initial;"">Good to know</b><br/></p><ul>
<li><p>The project is delivered by an <b>all-volunteer team</b>: we spend countless days and nights volunteering our time for this project - we believe in it, and hope you believe in it too.</p></li>

</ul><ul>
<li><p>The festival is <b>ONE MONTH</b> long. Why? <br/>-Because we want to give people from all over the world enough time to make their way here (Australians, there are no excuses!).<br/>-Because we want to live ‘symbiotically’ for a while and learn from each others’ habits and cultures.<br/>-Because the island and its people deserve a long break to celebrate life<br/><span style=""background-color: initial;"">-Because we want to have an active, daily presence at the refugee camps and make an impact in refugees’ lives.</span></p></li>
<li><p>It will give you a chance <b>to explore the unexplored</b>; we have discovered hidden treasures that you would never find in a travel guide.</p></li>
<li><p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">You will have the chance to participate in the creation of a </span><b style=""background-color: initial;"">huge mosaic that will stay on the island</b><span style=""background-color: initial;""> - a present from the SYMBIOSIS crowd to the inhabitants of Lesvos who stood in solidarity.

Amid the worst refugee crisis since World War II, the SYMBIOSIS Festival will fill a crucial gap – that is, the facilitation of cultural integration of refugees. This month-long celebration in Lesvos will enable artists, speakers, locals, refugees, and visitors from around the world to celebrate multiculturalism and altruism, and promote cross-cultural exchange and dialogue. It is an opportunity for a diverse range of people to come together and showcase their cultures, traditions and values and to share them with each other and the world. We aim to foster a better understanding of the ever-changing local and global identities.                                     The key aims of the SYMBIOSIS Festival are to:

Create an understanding and a connection between the local island community, the visitors, the volunteers and the refugees.
Give locals, refugees and international participants the chance to demonstrate their talents and express themselves in a safe, non-judgemental and welcoming community.
Introduce international audiences to Lesvos: one of the Mediterranean’s architecturally, naturally and culturally richest islands.
Introduce new models of sustainable tourism that are best-matched to Lesvos’ position on the frontlines of the refugee crisis.

Why support the SYMBIOSIS Festival?
SYMBIOSIS is filling a gap – that is, the cultural integration of refugees. It is unique as it is an opportunity for refugees, locals and internationals to spend time together as equals and not in the context of supporter and person in need. It is a way of humanising the refugees and making the existing humanitarian crisis more sustainable by inviting them to become active participants in the cultural life of the island.
What is my donation going towards?
All artists have agreed to perform at SYMBIOSIS for free.
However, there are inevitable costs in organising such a big event. Here is what your donation will go towards:

Workshop design and delivery at the refugee camps
Transportation to and from the refugee camps and between remote villages
Sound and light engineering
Equipment rental
Accommodation & food for our volunteers
Funding for administrative costs of an incorporated non-profit event

We expect a great number of people to attend the festival over THE FULL MONTH OF PROGRAMMING. If everyone who attends donates just $10 we will surely meet our fundraising goal! Good to know
The project is delivered by an all-volunteer team: we spend countless days and nights volunteering our time for this project - we believe in it, and hope you believe in it too.

The Festival is FREE as we want to give EVERYONE the chance to attend. You read right; you get to see amazing bands from around the world, participate in unique creative and movement workshops, watch a selection of independent films, attend exhibitions of invited local and international artists - all for free.

The festival is ONE MONTH long. Why? -Because we want to give people from all over the world enough time to make their way here (Australians, there are no excuses!).-Because we want to live ‘symbiotically’ for a while and learn from each others’ habits and cultures.-Because the island and its people deserve a long break to celebrate life-Because we want to have an active, daily presence at the refugee camps and make an impact in refugees’ lives.
It will give you a chance to explore the unexplored; we have discovered hidden treasures that you would never find in a travel guide.
You will have the chance to participate in the creation of a huge mosaic that will stay on the island - a present from the SYMBIOSIS crowd to the inhabitants of Lesvos who stood in solidarity. Imagine coming back ten years later and recognising your input on a publicly displayed piece of art...

                                   

What will SYMBIOSIS Festival include?SYMBIOSIS Festival is a huge celebration of life and coexistence!  Our activities include:
Music: World musicians and bands
Workshops: Creative and social-awareness workshops-Drama therapy, art therapy, music therapy with vulnerable children -Creative workshops aimed at showcasing the different cultures of the world; highlight the similarities, learn from the differences -Physical movement and choreography
Theatre performances: street performances, forum theatre, playback theatre, monologues 
Exhibitions: painting, photography, sculpture, jewellery and ceramics 
Panel discussions on: the arts, Lesvos's history, the refugee crisis, human rights, humanitarian aid efforts and the environment
Film Festival: a selection of films and documentaries on human rights and social issues
Games & challenges: unique opportunity to experience the outdoors, explore top-secret oases, meet and live with people from around the world
Food festival: try food from the Mediterranean and the Middle East, taste the local products, use the products to create your own recipe! 
What makes SYMBIOSIS Lesvos Arts Festival unique is that it focuses on the cultural integration of refugees. SYMBIOSIS will support refugees through:Cultural mediation: Refugees are faced with many challenges upon arrival in Europe, including a cultural shock. Successful cultural integration requires mutual knowledge and understanding between them and the local communities.

<p>Guess who's back! Gabriel San Roman and Carla Zarate have
joined forces again to return with the Subversive Historian’s ‘Calendar of
Revolt 2016’! Just like last year, the “Subversive Historian” morphs
from its origin as a daily radio segment as heard for years on KPFK-Pacifica
Radio in Los Angeles into 12-months of radical history! The 2016 edition comes with bolder artwork and 365 brand new subversive days in history. The Calendar of Revolt continues to focuses on the liberation struggles of workers,
radicals, women, people of color, and the LGBT community throughout the history
of the United States and elsewhere. <br/></p>
<p>Gabriel San Roman is the “Subversive Historian”
and also multimedia journalist whose work has been featured on KPFK Radio and
in the OC Weekly, Latino Rebels, and online at TruthOut in addition to
numerous other outlets. He’s also the author of “Venceremos:
Victor Jara and the New Song Movement” published by PM Press. </p>
<p>Carla Zarate is the designer of the ‘Calendar of
Revolt.’ Originally from Mexicali, Mexico, she was a producer, camera woman and
documentary directory before becoming a part of SolArt Gallery, a collective
promoting solidarity through ALL the arts in Santa Ana CA. Since then, Zarate’s
been busy creating graphic design for non-profit organizations, documenting the
Latin Alternative music scene, producing videos, collaborating with artists on
public art. </p>
<p><b>The Impact</b></p>
<p>The Subversive Historian’s ‘Calendar of
Revolt 2016' holds faithful to its mission of providing daily histories that 
have
otherwise remained “mysteries.” It's a rhyming nod to the fact that 
obscuring stories of injustice and resistance to it in the United States
 and beyond
frames establishment history. This has been on display in Tucson, 
Arizona and Texas before it where critical literature has been banned in
 the former and textbooks have been subject to ideological
revisions in the latter. To hell with that, we say!
</p><p><b>What We Need &amp; What You Get</b></p>
<p>This campaign is primarily aimed at covering the printing costs for 
the Calendar of Revolt. Carla and Gabriel will be collaborating again with 1984 Printing, an Oakland based printer that suffered heavy loses in a warehouse fire earlier this year. What do you get? Aside from the knowledge and

</div></div>","Thanks to everyone who has supported this cause so far!  You can see more about the building and the fundraising effort at www.dbarchitect.com/BringBeauty  Help us support Oakland seniors with local artwork!Lakeside Senior Housing provides 92 homes for low-income and formerly homeless seniors in a brand-new building with healthy interiors, supportive services, and educational programs in Oakland. This campaign is to raise money to BRING BEAUTY—works by local artists—into the common areas of Lakeside Senior Housing for color, life, and inspiration. You can sponsor a specific art piece, or make a general contribution.Sponsor this diptych by Warren Jee, for the Main Lobby LoungeDavid Baker Architects is partnering with developer Satellite Affordable Housing Associates and art studio Creativity Explored to bring bright, beautiful artwork into the building. This will provide the final touch to launch this new building as a warm and welcoming community place. 
Why Art?
“It'll liven us up and make us want to get up in the morning and see life and beauty. Art is beautiful!” —Valerie, resident
“It's more than just nice to have art on the walls, it's also part of our human experience.” —Susan, resident
""I like art because it enriches people's lives and it makes people be more encouraged and not depressed."" —Kat, resident
Sponsor this piece by Marilyn Wong, for the Community Room Entry 

What Art?
We have selected a wonderful suite of artworks, all by local artists, many of whom are senior citizens themselves. All funds raised will purchase, print, and install artwork in the Lakeside Senior Housing lobby, common areas, and elevator lobbies at each level. Creating a distinct visual identity for each floor, through varied color and style of artwork, helps senior residents orient themselves within the building. 


Sponsor these pieces by Cheryle Rutledge for the Second Floor Landing Lounges (see Perks: Plum Hero 1, Plum Hero 2)



Sponsor these pieces by Vincent Jackson, for the Third Floor Landing Lounges(see Perks: Crimson Hero 1, Crimson Hero 2)


Sponsor these pieces by Marilyn Wong, for the Fourth Floor Landing Lounges(see Perks: Indigo Hero 1, Indigo Hero 2)


Sponsor these pieces by Tony Gomez, for the Fifth Floor Landing Lounges(see Perks: Evergreen Hero 1, Evergreen Hero 2)
What's the Plan?
All artwork will be purchased from Creativity Explored, a
San Francisco-based non-profit art gallery that supports local artists with
physical and developmental disabilities. As part of our pro bono contribution, DBA will manage the process from selection through purchase, production, and installation. All of the art selected for the building has been created by local artists, many of whom are also senior citizens. 
Our partnership with Creativity Explored allows for many “wins”! 
It works like this:



With the money raised, we will purchase licenses for the
selected artworks from Creativity Explored, directly benefiting the artists.


Using Creativity Explored’s high-resolution scans, Sterling Graphics will
print and mount large-scale versions of the selected artworks to fill the
expansive common walls of the building, maximizing the “per square foot” cost
of art.

All donations are fully tax deductible and will be used by
Satellite Affordable Housing Associates toward this proposed art collection.

Please help us support these low-income and formerly homeless seniors by surrounding them with art and beauty and sending the signal that they are important and welcome members of the community!

<p><strong>Manuel Báez is an innovative architect, artist, and educator in Ottawa. Manuel and architecture students from his Crossings Workshop at Carleton University are producing a unique installation highlighting the diversity of the Canadian mosaic within our city. The installation will be featured at HUB Ottawa beginning in the fall. We are fundraising to cover the costs of the installation.<br/></strong></p>
<h3><strong>What’s the installation about?</strong></h3>
<p>""Resonant Currents"" is an expression of connection. It is a representation of the links that exist between the cultures of Canada and the world. This installation explores the parallels between disciplines - between architecture, art, the humanities and science. It is an expression of the local and global connections that happen daily in HUBs around the world.</p>
<p>Created with woven bands of birch plywood with wire-mesh highlights, ""Resonant Currents"" was inspired by intricate ethnic calligraphy, rich woven patterns and other cultural motifs.</p>
<h3><strong>Art that inspires innovation and community engagement.</strong></h3>
<p>HUB Ottawa, the future home of the installation, is a coworking space that houses a community of changemakers working to innovate for eco and social solutions to the world’s most pressing problems.</p>
<p>Our creative industrial space acts as a community centre where we create the conditions for hundreds of creative collisions, random introductions, experiments, idea jams and inter-disciplinary interactions every month. We believe that when our community thrives, the result is heightened creativity, new perspectives, valuable knowledge, unlikely relationships – and ultimately, ideas that change lives.</p>
<p>This installation will mirror the work of our community of local and global innovators, and the connections we aim to facilitate everyday at the HUB.</p>
<h3>Why this installation matters to you:</h3>
<p>Whether you’re someone who appreciates art, believes in the power of collaborative endeavors, or supports local artistic talent, we can all relate to the simple, yet profound vision this installation embodies. <strong>We’re asking for your support to cover material costs of this unique installation and showcase a world-class project by an architect and artist and his talented students right here in our community</strong>!</p>
<p>All funds raised will go directly to Manuel and his students to cover the costs of creating this installation. Our perks for donating include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tickets to the opening night party for the installation in September</li>
<li>A one month HUB membership</li>
<li>Your name engraved on a plaque to showcase your generousity in making this installation come to life</li>
</ul>
<p>We hope you will join us in making this installation a reality. Please support our campaign to fund Resonant Currents at HUB Ottawa.</p>
<h3><strong>Where does your contribution go?</strong></h3>
<p>We believe that all Canadians can relate to the vision this installation embodies. The inclusive vision of this installation, and the nature of the connections it seeks to embody represents what we all hope to have in our lives - a sense of belonging and interconnectedness.</p>
<p>All funds raised will go directly to recovering the material costs of the installation. We’re asking for your support to cover these material costs of this unique installation and showcase a world-class artist right here in our community!</p>
<h3>The ways that you can help:</h3>
<p>Donate: Take a look at the perks we have listed below for the four donation levels. Remember that simply by donating you can become a HUB member for a month!</p>
<p>Help us spread the word: Share the link to this campaign and our video on Twitter, Facebook and throughout your network!</p>
<p>Continue to support local artists in our community: Their work is invaluable and so is our support in getting them recognized. Help the Ottawa art community thrive!</p>

<h3><strong>Who’s the Architect/Artist/Educator and what has inspired him?</strong></h3>
<p>Manuel A. Báez is an Associate Professor at the Carleton University Azrieli School of Architecture and Urbanism. Previously, he taught in the United States at The Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art in New York City and the Rhode Island School Design in Providence, RI.</p>
<p>The parallels between the underlying themes of Manuel’s inter-disciplinary research and work as an educator, architect, and artist and those of HUB have motivated him to consider an installation at HUB Ottawa.</p>
<p>His work draws inspiration from the generative potential of the forms, structures and integrative systems generated by elemental processes that exist throughout the natural environment. Manuel’s work has been funded by such institutions as the Canada Council for the Arts, the New York Foundation for the Arts, the Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art, Cranbrook Academy of Art and Carleton University.</p>

<h3>We are raising $12,500 to convert the space</h3>
<p>My own money and in-kind donations are matching the Indiegogo $12.5K campaign for contributions. Here are where our expenses are going:</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1498596154/mplvl6zihonchhhkfzsc.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>About half of the build-out expenditures will help with creating the additional studios: mine and two others, for rent to artists. The other half will go toward rehabbing the teaching space. Income from the rental studios will support the ability to keep the teaching space open and affordable.

<p>If we do not reach the full goal of $12.5K, what we do raise will go proportionately toward the sectors highlighted above. If we reach a higher goal, it will be used to fund projects that are currently on hold such as the installation of track lighting, or starting a scholarship fund. </p>
<p><strong>What will you get for your donation?</strong> From regular updates and photos about the project to your name listed as a contributor, to a print of one of my paintings, to - at the top end - a commissioned painting of the subject of your choice <u>or</u> a summer week at a Maine lakeside cottage.

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>For a number of years, there have been few new artist studios created on Portland's peninsula. Especially those with street access and easy parking. We're adding 3, including mine.</p>
<p>Artists bring beauty and meaning to the world. Most work a ""day job"" to get by. The availability of a teaching studio-for-hire gives artists access to a favored source of income: teaching their version of art. I know, because I've been doing it for 8 years. For those who don't teach but need space to spread out for a day or a weekend, we can offer that too. </p>
<p>I've been saving my money. I've been consulting with business experts. I've had a dozen generous volunteers doing some very nasty jobs. My family and friends are with me. Now I need you.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The good thing about this business model is that the rent of 2 extra studios in the space will subsidize a substantial portion of the monthly lease. That said, risks may include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Slow response to the rental of the studios or teaching space</li>
<li>Uncovering a major construction problem</li>
<li>Social media, email, and word-of-mouth marketing not being enough to distribute the offers of space and classes.</li>
</ul>
<p>Yet, I already have inquiries from artists who are looking for studios and/or want to teach. I have done my due diligence on the building, though it's old and it's possible we may find ""things."" </p>
<p>I've consulted with the best start-up advisors. I have my financial projections spelled out, including contingencies. My contractor is already at work. I've set my intentions and am crossing my fingers. (Can't hurt.)</p>

<strong>Please</strong>, get the word out and make some noise about my campaign.

ABOUT THE PROJECT:
Six emerging artists and one documentary filmmaker have an exhibition in Toronto and need help getting there! This trip is important in its attempt to contribute to a much needed dialogue and exchange of ideas between artists from their respective cities across Canada. We propose to bring art produced in Calgary to another major centre in Canada: Toronto. As emerging artists we feel the need to contextualize our work nationally and build our community beyond our own borders.
The YYC to YYZ Exhibition will present a collection of work from each of the artists that represents their own practice while at the same time capturing the same ambitious DIY spirit discussed in Alternative Currency.  By sharing their work, views, and interests the artists hope to connect with a new audience and artists from a different city so as to initiate new relationships, share best practices and cultivate a national dialogue between the cities.  Through this exhibition there also lies the potential to begin exchange exhibitions between artists and galleries from across the country.
This exhibition is inspired by Lewis Liski’s inaugural documentary, Alternative Currency. Alternative Currency which premiered in front of a 200-person audience and opened the 2013 MISC Festival, is a feature length documentary that focuses on five emerging artists in the fourth year of their Bachelor of Fine Arts Degrees and the landscape that these artists enter into in the year Calgary was awarded the distinction of cultural capital of Canada. By giving the history of Calgary's art scene, from its grass roots initiatives to its do-it-yourself attitude, Alternative Currency attempts to answer whether there is an alternative to Calgary's current art landscape, if there is hope for these emerging artists, and how a city known for its western stampede could become a contemporary arts centre.
 
THE SHOW:
 
YYC to YYZ will be exhibited at Norman Felix Gallery and in partnership with Friendly Wealth, located at 627 Queen Street West in downtown Toronto from August 7th-14th. The entire trip will take place from July 27 to August 18, 2013
 
FROM YYC to YYZ:
As aspiring artists, sometimes our dreams are bigger than our wallets. But that doesn’t mean we won’t try to make things happen. Driving to Toronto from Calgary is no small task, but we will try nonetheless. We will be travelling in a red minivan with a trailer in tow full of art. Six educated people in one vehicle traveling across Canada in search of knowledge and experience, shoved together like a family on vacation, will inevitably have it’s interesting occurrences. Lewis Liski will be there documenting the trip and exhibition to create a short documentary that will be screened shortly after our arrival back. A catalog will also be produced in conjunction with the show and will feature writing and content from all of the artists. There will be a panel discussion at the Alberta College of Art and Design with the artists involved following the trip. 
We have the show already booked and the work is currently being produced. The artists featured will include: 
Natasha Alphonse, Ashley Ohman, Lindsay Falk, Kris Weinmann, Jesse Stilwell, Roman Abdoullaev  & Dan Zimmerman (The ArvbSpring).
The work produced for the show will range from sculpture, photography and media installation, to drawing, painting and performance. What more could you possibly ask for?!!
WHERE YOUR SUPPORT WILL GO?
We are attempting to raise $2660. The money will be broken down into three sections with the priority of funds starting from the top down.
1. Travelling in the Minivan (Gas, Flat Tires) – $1360
- ($120 & 600km/tank, 6800km round trip = $1360)
2. Accommodations (Motel 6, Travelodge) - $800.00
-(2 Rooms @ avg. $100/rm/nght x 4 nights)
3. Promotion (Posters, Flyers, Media, Catalog) - $500.00
Accommodation- we will all be staying with family, friends, or friends of friends.
Food & Day to Day costs - Our hope is that the potential sale of some of our artwork will help us offset the day-to-day costs of food and travel while we are in Toronto as well as any shortfalls in our fundraising.
HOW WILL IT BENEFIT CALGARY?
Our intention is to share our art, experiences and ambitions beyond our own borders in a way that inspires and stimulates the healthy growth of our communities.
Upon returning, there will be a presentation and panel discussion at the Alberta College of Art and Design (Date to be announced) where we will be premiering the short documentary and launching the catalogue. The panel discussion will examine the cohesion of arts communities in Canada and how artists from Calgary contribute to an inclusive and progressive dialogue with artists and other major art centre’s across Canada.

<h3>Hello, my name is David Shannon.  I'm an artist/student/grind slave living in Ocean Springs, Mississippi.  Ocean Springs is notably more art centric than most cities in south Mississippi, though in the 17 years i've lived here, there hasn't been an outstanding, outspoken artist community.  This project is an attempt to bring that community together.  </h3>
<p>Art is as diverse as the people who create it, however, it seems as though our city has been playing it safe.  Themes are seldom explored and local artists are more widely accepted when they portray classic coastal art.  Needless to say, southern Mississippi is a place ripe with natural beauty.  Scenic art is definitely a style that every painter should explore, but to be limited to that is selling an entire cities worth of potential short. </p>
<p>What i hope to accomplish is the construction of a mural wall where a full spectrum of artists will have full use of the space for one month to fully emmerse themselves in a chosen theme.  Specifically, 12 artists over 12 months regarding 12 themes loosely representative of a birth and death cycle and themes related to the human experience.  This project is designed to bring the art community and the general public together and keep the artistic process out in the open.  Relations have been established with a local newspaper where they will do a monthly spread regarding their piece and a 'meet the artists' article.  A local up-and-coming photographer will be hired to immortalize the artistic process so that the artist may keep a record for their portfolio, which will also add to the photographers reportoire.  this campaign, i and many others believe, will be a gateway that will open many doors for artists who seek to endeavor public projects, contemporary or otherwise.</p>
<p>All funding will see that the wall will be built in an aesthetically pleasing manner and congruous with the space it occupies.  Also, it will see to the compensation of the first few artist in the line-up based on time spent.  i do hope to get some outside sponsorship that would allow me to keep the space maintained and to finance future artists.  I'm in the process of developing a program that will allow the artist, at their discretion, to opt out of their compensation to help aid in local school art programs.</p>
<p>all contributors will be given a personal credit, read aloud, upon opening day, should we make it.  all procedes will go toward maintaining this project so we can shoot for even higher.  i will gladly accept any help, including just helping to get the word around.  i am in your debt.  thank you so much.</p>

<p>i received an excellent quote from an experienced contractor, so glad that's out of the way.  i also found a young photographer who convinced me that he's devoted to the project.  official flyers will be printed soon.  also, a personal thank you to the local business owners who jumped so quickly to help out and to all those outside of my periphery who helped to spread the word.  tusen takk!</p>

<p>both the flyers and the cad drawing for the wall are being finalized by the design team and the contractor, respectively.  also, the one and only shed bbq has entertained the idea of a fundraising event slotted for next month.  this project is pivotal and i'm very surprised that the community has so quickly taken an interest, though i must stress that this undertaking won't lift off the ground without a bit of financial aid.  thank you again for your support.</p>

0,"<div class=""routerContentStory-storyBody"" data-v-1df7bf5a=""""> <h3>Hi! My brother and I have a web-based short documentary series idea that we call ""Creative Textures"". This web program documents local artists, their crafts, and their inspirational insight regarding creativity and the arts. This is a non-discriminatory program; people from any walk of life are eligible to be showcased, and as long as they consider what they do to be an artform, we would love to capture them and their ideas in a 2-5 minute video segment. We are heavily rooted in the art community of LA's south bay and love to see our friends get the recognition they truly deserve, which is the sole reason we want this program to happen. Creative Textures is set apart from any other documentary program of its kind because we do not just showcase someone's art; we take it a step further. We aim to figuratively ""dissect"" the subject and give them a chance to express in words the cathartic relationship they have with their art because, after all, art is just as personal as it is public.

My brother and I have a web-based short documentary series idea that we call ""Creative Textures"". This web program documents local artists, their crafts, and their inspirational insight regarding creativity and the arts. This is a non-discriminatory program; people from any walk of life are eligible to be showcased, and as long as they consider what they do to be an artform, we would love to capture them and their ideas in a 2-5 minute video segment. We are heavily rooted in the art community of LA's south bay and love to see our friends get the recognition they truly deserve, which is the sole reason we want this program to happen. Creative Textures is set apart from any other documentary program of its kind because we do not just showcase someone's art; we take it a step further. We aim to figuratively ""dissect"" the subject and give them a chance to express in words the cathartic relationship they have with their art because, after all, art is just as personal as it is public.

Our goals are to have fun, inspire others, and learn and grow</h3>
<p>Hi, we're Devon and Lexi and we're known as the Chalk Twins. We are 14-time, award-winning identical twin chalk artists. We have been chalking in front of festival crowds for nine years and anime/comic convention crowds for over a year.</p>
<p>We love anime! We want to bring art to the masses at these anime conventions. So many convention attendees are budding artists themselves. The most fulfilling thing we hear at conventions is when young artists say they are inspired to try their hand at chalk (or any other medium) because they watched us.</p>
<p>We've been lucky enough to have been invited to some of the largest conventions in the US - Anime Expo, Dragon*Con and MegaCon. Now we want to quadruple the number of conventions we attend in 2014 and go international.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h3>Where we are Going, What we Need and What you Get</h3>
<p>Here are the conventions we plan to attend. Some have already said yes. For this initial campaign we are only raising the funds for the ones that have said yes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Taiyoucon, Mesa, AZ Jan 3-5 (yes), need $1,539</li>
<li>Ichibancon, Concord, NC Jan 9-12 (maybe), need $802</li>
<li>Swampcon, Gainesville, FL Jan 18-19 (yes), need $237</li>
<li>Ohayocon, Columbus, OH Jan 24-26 (maybe), need $1,060</li>
<li>Kawa Kon, St. Louis, MO Feb 7-9 (yes), need $738</li>
<li>Katsucon, National Harbor, MD (maybe) Feb 14-16, need $822</li>
<li>Con Nooga, Chattanooga, TN Feb 21-23 (yes), need $1,032</li>
<li>ROFCON, Virginia Beach, VA Feb 28-Mar 2 (yes), need $1,122</li>
<li>Tora Con, Rochester, NY Mar 8-9, need $272<br/>
</li>
<li>Anime Matsuri, Houston, TX Mar 14-16 (yes), need $2,090<br/>
</li>
<li>MegaCon, Orlando, FL Mar 21-23 (yes), need $50</li>
<li>Perth Oz Comic Con, Perth, AU Mar 28-30 (maybe), need $4,419</li>
<li>Kawaii-kon, Honolulu, HI Apr 4-6 (yes), need $3,171</li>
<li>Sabaku Con, Albuquerque, NM Apr 11-13, need $1,525</li>
<li>Anime Conji, San Diego, CA Apr 18-20 (yes), need $1,308<br/>
</li>
<li>Calgary Expo, Calgary, AB Apr 25-28, need $1,582</li>
</ul>
<p>$10,000 covers airfare, non-Con hotel days and car rental for the 9 conventions that have said yes. This doesn't include money for hotels during Con days, marketing, materials or food. We're hoping to get some other sponsorship to cover these additional costs. We will keep you updated if other shows invite us to attend. Any additional funds collected will go toward other shows. To attend all 16 of these shows will cost us approximately $22,000. That will be our stretch goal if we start to exceed the $10,000 we are looking to raise now. If this campaign is successful we'll be back to continue the second and third parts of this campaign to cover the entire year.</p>
<p>We think we've put together some great, unique perks to reward you for your contribution to our campaign. </p>
<p><b>Bookmarks.</b> We have five 2.5"" x 7"" bookmarks available - Fred and George Weasley, The Hobbit, Princess Mononoke, Tamaki and Sebastian.

<p> </p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://playuzzle.com/sites/default/files/styles/large/public/photos/Playuzzle%20Image%201.jpg?itok=0U2RhXYV"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>It's part art, part puzzle, and all cool. It's 16 lighted towers and 5 lighted buttons with 48 infrared beams. As you walk between the towers or press the buttons, you change Playuzzle. As you line up matching colors on adjacent towers, the EL-wire outline lights up on those towers. When you light all 16 towers, you've solved the puzzle, unlocking a wave of color, sound, and flashing light as your reward.</p>
<p>When it's too busy for puzzle solving, Playuzzle switches automatically to Art Mode, where the buttons become electronic paint buckets and you are a walking paintbrush.</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;""><strong>This part is important.</strong> <em>Like many large projects, we've had our delays and we owe it to you to be up front about it: we have scaled back our funding request to match what we can accomplish with reasonable certainty with the time </em><em>remaining </em><em>before the event - a smaller 4-tower version that will let people have fun while letting us verify the actual design in desert conditions. Your support gets us to the Playa this year, and next year we will do a 16- or 32-tower version. It's critical to get to Playa this year to make next year work.</em></p>
<p>By the way, Playuzzle makes for great self-portraits!</p>

<h1>What's Inside?</h1>
<p><em>It looks so simple on the outside. What's inside? </em></p>
<p>Quite a bit, actually. It takes a lot of technology to bring Playuzzle to life. Each tower has a both multicolor LED lighting to light the tower and EL-wire to outline it. Up to 8 infrared transmitters and receivers detect your motion. Hidden speakers provide ambient music and sound cues. Strobe lights light up the sky when the puzzle is solved. Each tower has a custom-designed microprocessor-driven control board. Underground, a 350-foot trench network connects all of the towers, buttons, lampposts, power station, and control station providing power and data. Three separate pieces of software operate across 22 processors to create the environment, including a real-time music generator that designs music that reflects the state of the puzzle.</p>

<h1>What Do We Need?</h1>
<p>We've spent two years designing, re-designing, and improving Playuzzle. We've built and tested all of the various components. Now we need your help for the final push, to purchase the materials to build all 16 towers, and to transport Playuzzle to the Playa.</p>
<h1>Where Does the Money Go?</h1>
<p>All work on Playuzzle is donated. About 75% of the money goes to the purchase of materials. The remainder goes to fundraising rewards and to transportation of the puzzle.</p>
<p>Our total budget is about $6,000 and we need about $3,500 to complete the mission. If we get a little more, we'll add more comfortable seating and a giant shade tarp for daytime shade. However we're asking for a litle less, and we'll bring a reduced version if we only receive basic funding, and grow it next year. But we need to get there this year to prove out the technology in the harsh playa environment.</p>
<p>Our Bill of Materials for Playuzzle is long, but if you like spreadsheets, the full budget is here: <a href=""http://www.playuzzle.com/budget.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.playuzzle.com/budget.pdf</a> or <a href=""http://www.playuzzle.com/budget.xlsx"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.playuzzle.com/budget.xlsx</a></p>
<h1>Rewards</h1>
<p>The biggest reward is, and should be, pride. It doesn't happen without you. But to help you feel even more a part of it, we have an array of rewards from shirts to dinner with the artist to owning your own Playuzzle tower. But a pldege of $25 receives our really cool Playuzzle medallion. (It's also included with any pledge of $100 or more). It's custom minted metal with 6 colors, and only supporters and team members get one.</p>

<h1>Into the Future</h1>
<p>There's more than just the desert. <strong>Playuzzle doesn't end when the Man burns!</strong> Many great pieces of art start on the Playa. We want to make Playuzzle available to the word as urban art. We'll let you build you own using our plans and software.And we're designing tools to let you control Playuzzle yourself, creating your own puzzles.</p>
<h1>Can I Help?</h1>
<p>Yes! Whether or not you can afford to help financially, we welcome your participation this year or next. If Playuzzle happens, we guarantee that Playuzzle II will be even cooler!</p></div>","What is Playuzzle?
 

It's part art, part puzzle, and all cool. It's 16 lighted towers and 5 lighted buttons with 48 infrared beams. As you walk between the towers or press the buttons, you change Playuzzle. As you line up matching colors on adjacent towers, the EL-wire outline lights up on those towers. When you light all 16 towers, you've solved the puzzle, unlocking a wave of color, sound, and flashing light as your reward.
When it's too busy for puzzle solving, Playuzzle switches automatically to Art Mode, where the buttons become electronic paint buckets and you are a walking paintbrush.
This part is important. Like many large projects, we've had our delays and we owe it to you to be up front about it: we have scaled back our funding request to match what we can accomplish with reasonable certainty with the time remaining before the event - a smaller 4-tower version that will let people have fun while letting us verify the actual design in desert conditions. Your support gets us to the Playa this year, and next year we will do a 16- or 32-tower version. It's critical to get to Playa this year to make next year work.
By the way, Playuzzle makes for great self-portraits!

What's Inside?
It looks so simple on the outside. What's inside? 
Quite a bit, actually. It takes a lot of technology to bring Playuzzle to life. Each tower has a both multicolor LED lighting to light the tower and EL-wire to outline it. Up to 8 infrared transmitters and receivers detect your motion. Hidden speakers provide ambient music and sound cues. Strobe lights light up the sky when the puzzle is solved. Each tower has a custom-designed microprocessor-driven control board. Underground, a 350-foot trench network connects all of the towers, buttons, lampposts, power station, and control station providing power and data. Three separate pieces of software operate across 22 processors to create the environment, including a real-time music generator that designs music that reflects the state of the puzzle.

Our custom control board - note the words ""Playuzzle Prototype""
What Do We Need?
We've spent two years designing, re-designing, and improving Playuzzle. We've built and tested all of the various components. Now we need your help for the final push, to purchase the materials to build all 16 towers, and to transport Playuzzle to the Playa.
Where Does the Money Go?
All work on Playuzzle is donated. About 75% of the money goes to the purchase of materials. The remainder goes to fundraising rewards and to transportation of the puzzle.
Our total budget is about $6,000 and we need about $3,500 to complete the mission. If we get a little more, we'll add more comfortable seating and a giant shade tarp for daytime shade.

<h3>Despre ”Copacul de la bibliotecă”</h3>
<p>Am lansat un proiect care să povestească prin prisma designului despre copacii prăbușiți în Chișinău la sfârșit de aprilie 2017 și în același timp să ofere spațiului public o alternativă de mobilier urban realizat din trunchiului unuia din acei arbori. Ne-am propus ca scuarul Bibliotecii Naționale „Vasile Alecsandri” și Teatrul Republican de Păpuși „Licurici” să rămână și mai departe mediul platanului căzut după acele ninsori. Un mediu în care el ar continua să existe transformat în bănci de diferite dimensiuni şi configurații, create așa cum o permite trunchiul său. Se abordează o prelucrare de manieră sculpturală a copacului, iar prin concepția de design a acestui mobilier îmbinăm lemnul masiv (în forma sa brută ca material cald cu o mare varietate de texturi) și metalul negru  – ca element de contrast, structural și rece.</p>

Mathias is a silkscreen instructor, makes light sculptures, and is a budding graphic novelist! Kim studied printmaking and now makes sculptures and installations out of fur, textiles, paper mache, and other things. And we are *very* excited to announce we have been accepted to a residency in Nepal with the Marpha Foundation!</p><p>This is a great collaborative opportunity for us as artists, but unfortunately the residency fees are just a little outside our budget. The fees are $1500 USD in total, which comes to $1986 CAD (essentially 2000). We are already on the Indian Subcontinent at the moment, so getting to Nepal and surrounding costs of the residency are affordable to us! It is just the residency fees that we can't afford, and we do not want financial constraints to stop us from taking on such an amazing opportunity, so we are asking for your help (if you are able!) to send us to Marpha! </p><h3>About the Marpha Foundation</h3><p>The Marpha Foundation is an NGO in the town of Marpha, Nepal that was founded in 2014! They work with children and families in the lower mustang region of Nepal and they work to improve local education. Unfortunately, rural communities in Nepal are often overlooked as backward and underdeveloped, which ignored a lot of the knowledges these communities have. So Marpha seeks to work with the communities in a way that honours their wisdom and works with the communities.</p><p>Marpha created the residency program because while they have been teaching their students art for many years, their students rarely have a chance to interact with art made by others. The residency program thus aims to expand the presence of artists in Marpha and create a collection of art pieces and art books for the children to interact with and enjoy. We will be donating the hard copy of the comic book that we are creating to the foundation, as well as potentially teaching a short silkscreen workshop to the children! </p><h3>Why this is so important to us!!</h3><p>Artist Residencies are not only important cultural cross-fertilization, but excellent opportunities for learning and for working uninterrupted on a project! We have never had the opportunity to work on a project collaboratively before, and this residency will give us the time and space to do just that! This is an excellent opportunity for our careers; we will be able to create a finished product during this residency (a short story comic book) and network with artists and other villagers in Nepal. This is also Mathias' first residency!</p><h3>But why do we need your help?</h3><p>Unfortunately, while we have enough money to get to Nepal (we are currently travelling and so have a modest budget for backpacking around the indian subcontinent), we did not know we would be applying for and then getting this residency when we were initially setting off on our trip. We only saved enough money to support ourselves on a shoestring backpacker budget, not for a residency. </p><p>The residency has a fee of $300 USD per week which covers the cost of room and board and studio in Marpha. In total this comes to $1500 USD or roughly $2000 CAD (as of January 2017's exchange rate). This is outside of our modest travellers budget that we have! While we can afford to get to Marpha, and to cover a portion of the fees, we don't have the money to pay for all of the fees. Especially with the current exchange rate between CAN and USD! This is also quite a last minute endeavour (it is now early January 2017, and the residency starts March 1st) and so applying for a grant is risky and even if we did get one we may not get it in time for the residency to start.</p><p>We are hoping to crowdfund between half and 3/4 of the residency fee if possible! Any little bit helps; even if we don't get all of the money covered, whatever we get will be put toward the residency fees (the rest will probably go on Kim's Visa, to be hopefully paid off later when we get home). We want to avoid going into debt, especially since both of us want to go back to school in September and will need to take out more loans for that.</p><h3>But what do you get out of it??</h3><p>We have come up with some fun perks if you want to donate to our little cause! Kim is selling some handmade things from her etsy store! There are also postcards, commissions, SPICE PACKAGES, original art, and of course a PDF or a physical copy of the comic book we are making on this residency!!</p><h3>""But I don't have any money!""</h3><p>Thats totally okay! We get that. If you cannot contribute financially, consider just sharing this with your pals! Any sharing on facebook or instagram or whatever social media you use will help us a lot, and we really appreciate it! There are indiegogo tools to share, or you can copy and paste the link directly!

<h3>UPDATE</h3>
<p>After the overwhelming demand for the book outside of the campaign, I have decided to look into options at offering the book in some capacity online. We will mention when and where the books are available for purchase on the Kukubee facebook page <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/pages/Kukubee-Designs/138831022805948"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.facebook.com/pages/Kukubee-Designs/...</a><br/>Sorry for Facebook link, but it's the easiest way to get a wide message across. Please don't feel any obligation to like or follow, but if you check that page periodically, we will be making announcements there.</p>
<p>The book may be offered in PDF format or a softcover version of the book. The limited edition signed, premium, hardcover books will most likely remain exclusive to campaign contributors. Perks will no longer be available and contributions made outside of the campaign will not be eligible to be mentioned on the Thank You page.</p>
<p>Also, the price for books outside of the campaign may not be the same as you see here.</p>
<p>Thank you everyone for your support and sorry to everyone who missed out on the campaign.</p>

<h3>What is Glitch?</h3>
<p>Glitch was the wonderfully whimsical online game developed by Tiny Speck, Inc. In 2012, Glitch was nominated for two GDC Online Awards, for Game Design and Visual Art. The mission of this campaign is to preserve all the incredible art from the enormous, ever-changing, persistent world of Glitch.</p>
</div></div>","UPDATE
After the overwhelming demand for the book outside of the campaign, I have decided to look into options at offering the book in some capacity online. We will mention when and where the books are available for purchase on the Kukubee facebook page https://www.facebook.com/pages/Kukubee-Designs/...Sorry for Facebook link, but it's the easiest way to get a wide message across. Please don't feel any obligation to like or follow, but if you check that page periodically, we will be making announcements there.
The book may be offered in PDF format or a softcover version of the book. The limited edition signed, premium, hardcover books will most likely remain exclusive to campaign contributors. Perks will no longer be available and contributions made outside of the campaign will not be eligible to be mentioned on the Thank You page.
Also, the price for books outside of the campaign may not be the same as you see here.
Thank you everyone for your support and sorry to everyone who missed out on the campaign.

<p>For the past 9 years I have been stenciling koi around America. In June I will be traveling to 4 cities to paint my koi stencils. Chicago, Milwaukee, Madison, and Detroit are my main stops. These stencils are quite unique in that you can literally make 32 different patterned koi before you need to repeat it. This helps make groupings look more natural and visually interesting  If this is more successful then I imagined I will add more cities.</p>
<p><b></b></p>
<h3><b>Why Koi?</b></h3>
<p></p>
<p>People have asked me for
years what is the meaning or purpose of the koi I stencil on sidewalks across
America. Well the answer may be simple but it has a lot of meanings both to me
as a person and to the symbols of harmony, strength, good fortune, friendship,
success, prosperity, longevity, courage, ambition, and perseverance.</p>
<p>  In 2006, while finishing my last art degree in
Photography, at Pecks School of the Arts in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, I had the opportunity
to travel around china for three months to study ancient and contemporary art. <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">While
I was looking at communist posters I also was looking at Chinese scrolls and
learning the different hidden messages and iconography that are under the
surface of the koi image. The koi symbolize several lessons and even trials
individuals often encounter in life. The koi has a powerful and energetic life
force, its ability to swim against currents and even travel upstream. Other
symbolism of the koi includes, good fortune, success, prosperity, longevity,
courage, ambition, and perseverance. The number of koi also symbolizes a
different and unique message that correlates with the Chinese lucky numbers.
During the time of the cultural revolution the ancient ways of thinking and symbols
where to be literally destroyed to make way for a new modern China.</span></p>
<p>  One symbolizes strength, courage, overcoming obstacles,
friendship, good fortune, success, and longevity. Two is a symbol of double
happiness or good things come in pairs. It is often used in wedding decorations
for a happy life in marriage.  The word
three sounds like the word birth and represent the three stages of life. Said
to be birth, marriage and death.  Four is
an unlucky number. In Chinese the word four sounds very much like the word
death and for that reason four is never used in china for several things including
placement of four objects.  Five has two meanings;
first it symbolizes transformation as it took the emperor five arches to walk
through to actually get to the Forbidden City. There are four walls surrounding
Beijing. Each wall has more levels of security, where the very last arch would
be the Forbidden City doors making the five arches.  The second meaning has to do with the five
elements of the universe. Earth, Wind, Water, Fire and Metal. China realized
early on that a metal fell from the sky in the form of a meteoroid. While we
have the four elements of earth in western society china has chosen to include
the universe as a fifth element, metal. Six is a symbol for business
relationships, and sounds like the word flow in terms of wealth. While seven is
for more personal relationships like with friends, family and neighbors. Eight sounds
like the word prosper or wealth and symbolizes good fortune, which is often
used in new business to help generate wealth. Nine historically has to do with
the emperor; it is believed that
the dragon has nine children. It also symbolizes harmony.</p> </div> <div> <h3>What You Get</h3> <ul>

first it symbolizes transformation as it took the emperor five arches to walk
through to actually get to the Forbidden City. There are four walls surrounding
Beijing. Each wall has more levels of security, where the very last arch would
be the Forbidden City doors making the five arches.  The second meaning has to do with the five
elements of the universe. Earth, Wind, Water, Fire and Metal. China realized
early on that a metal fell from the sky in the form of a meteoroid. While we
have the four elements of earth in western society china has chosen to include
the universe as a fifth element, metal. Six is a symbol for business
relationships, and sounds like the word flow in terms of wealth. While seven is
for more personal relationships like with friends, family and neighbors. Eight sounds
like the word prosper or wealth and symbolizes good fortune, which is often
used in new business to help generate wealth. Nine historically has to do with
the emperor; it is believed that
the dragon has nine children. It also symbolizes harmony.   What You Get 

A total of 8 custom made and hand cut stenciled stickers from 4 of my original designs. Each sticker is a original work of art in multiples, hand stenciled and die cut on USPS stickers to keep it legit street art.


Hand stenciled t-shirt with 2 unique koi. Each stenciled image of the koi is unique making no two shirts exactly alike. 2 is a symbol of double happiness and also good things come in pairs.


A signed copy of San Francisco Street Art by Steve Rotmen. The book contains 4 pictures of art making me the most credited artist in the book. A must-have for any street art enthusiast, this book presents the most mind blowing examples of renegade creativity in San Francisco.





A hand stenciled koi print on artist paper with one koi on each. Each is signed and dated and ready to be framed. No two prints are exactly alike.




A one of a kind hand stenciled koi on wood. Measuring 12x18 inches this one of a kind koi stencil hangs beautifully in your house or office. Each koi stencil is unique and no two paintings are alike.


A unique one of a kind stenciled window. Each window is roughly 32x26 inches and will have 3 koi which is the symbol for ""The three stages of life."" Birth, Marriage and Death. No two koi or windows are exactly alike.


A unique one of a kind koi painting on a glass window. Each window measures roughly 34x32 inches and contains 5 koi which is the symbol for Transformation. No two koi or windows are exactly alike.


Along my travels to paint koi I will paint you a custom one of a kind mural of koi or birds. You can find examples of my past murals at www.JeremyNovyStencils.com Some locations may not be available and size to be determined.
    The Impact The impact of my koi has gone far beyond a 16 inch spray painted stencil. It has crossed social, racial, political and many more boundaries we face in our public day to day travels. You can pretty much guarantee if you spot one you will smile, but not only that. You can have a conversation with someone of a totally different background about the koi and most likely be a very pleasant ice breaker to social conversations. 
People have since had them tattooed on them, painted cars, murals, and even getting best public art of 2013 in Milwaukee, WI by reader vote in through the local newspaper.

<h3><strong>The Story</strong></h3>
<p>Hi! We’re Rana and Saif, a recently married Egyptian couple. Our marriage has just turned one so we're excited to launch this project as a celebration!!  We’ve been planning for it for over two years now and the lockdown has given us a chance to materialise it. We’re very happy to finally share 'Fun Pharaoh' with the world.</p>
<p>We both run Letterlust which is a graphic design studio and gift shop. Saif comes from a business background and Rana is a Graphic designer. We're both stationery enthusiasts so this project is the perfect tribute to our passion and heritage. </p>
<p>For thousands of years Pharaohs have used colours widely in their artefacts. This was the inspiration behind our designs. The concept is to create Egyptian souvenirs that are fun and modern. If you're in doubt of what to buy for your friends or simply into Egyptian art then this project is for you ;)</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3><strong>Fun Pharaoh Products</strong></h3>
<p>This campaign will help us produce:</p>
<p>1. A set of three colourful hard enamel pins.</p>
<p>2. A set of three black and gold luxury hard enamel pins. </p>
<p>3. A set of four postcards (postcards are an add on perk that can be purchased at checkout). </p>
<p>These are the ten designs going to be produced in the first phase, final products may vary slightly.</p>

<h3><strong>Specs</strong></h3>
<p>All our hard enamel pins are made of pure zinc alloy material in order to ensure light weight and strength. The colourful 'Fun Pharaoh' pins are plated with black nickel while the 'Luxury' pins are plated in gold for a more premium look and feel. Pins come attached to a backing card with information about its history and a black rubber clutch that is sturdy and tight. Our postcards are A6 and are printed on semi glossy coated 350 gsm paper for long lasting anti-scratch cards, the back is always uncoated for ease of writing with any kind of pen or pencil. </p>

<h3><strong>Plan &amp; Timeline</strong></h3>
<p>Our current goal is to reach £1,000 in preorders. The campaign will run for 30 days. Right after the campaign ends every backer will be sent a survey to choose the final perk and have one final chance to change delivery address. Later we’ll start production and shipping will take place starting September 2020. We will be communicating with our backers to let them know of any possible delays due to current pandemic. Our suppliers have been very helpful and are always on time so fingers crossed!</p>

<p> </p>
<h3><strong>Stretch Goals</strong></h3>
<p>After the campaign achieves its first target for every extra £500 we will unlock 2 more enamel pin designs. This initial fund will kick-start our endeavours to sell our products to stockists in cities with a lot of tourism revolving around Egyptian monuments like Cairo, Giza, Luxor, London, Turin, Paris &amp; Berlin. Do you think we can do it?

<strong>Lots of love from Egypt</strong> ❤️</h3><p> </p></div>","The Story
Hi! We’re Rana and Saif, a recently married Egyptian couple. Our marriage has just turned one so we're excited to launch this project as a celebration!!  We’ve been planning for it for over two years now and the lockdown has given us a chance to materialise it. We’re very happy to finally share 'Fun Pharaoh' with the world.
We both run Letterlust which is a graphic design studio and gift shop. Saif comes from a business background and Rana is a Graphic designer. We're both stationery enthusiasts so this project is the perfect tribute to our passion and heritage. 
For thousands of years Pharaohs have used colours widely in their artefacts. This was the inspiration behind our designs. The concept is to create Egyptian souvenirs that are fun and modern. If you're in doubt of what to buy for your friends or simply into Egyptian art then this project is for you ;)
 

Fun Pharaoh Products
This campaign will help us produce:
1. A set of three colourful hard enamel pins.
2. A set of three black and gold luxury hard enamel pins. 
3. A set of four postcards (postcards are an add on perk that can be purchased at checkout). 
These are the ten designs going to be produced in the first phase, final products may vary slightly.

</p><p>One Motorcycle Show</p>
<p>My name is Brenden Smith and I am an artist, mostly a
painter.  I have promised 3 large painted
pieces (48” x 60”) to the 1 Motorcycle Show in Portland, OR, Feb 13, 14, and
15th and am trying to raise gas and lodging funds to get my paintings and
myself up there.  </p>
<p>An artist is always trying to get their artwork in front of as
many of the right type of people as possible and this show, in it’s sixth year is
an amazing opportunity.  To have every bike builder, bike blogger and
industry representative in the US in attendance, as well as every curious motorcycle
enthusiast in the Portland, OR area, see my art at this even may result in a
sale or other opportunity.  </p>
<p>It’s hard to cash a check on a maybe, so I’m asking my friends
for help.</p>
<p>It’s almost 4,000 miles, round trip from my apartment in Aspen,
CO to the middle of Portland, OR.  My
truck gets a 16mpg.  Gas is cheap right
now but if I estimate it at $4 a gallon, we’re talking $1000.  I added $500 for food, lodging and missing
three days of work.</p>
<p>This is a big deal and a huge gamble that I’m not used to
making.  Some financial backing and
support from my friends would go a long way to making this happen for me.  $20 is good, $50 is awesome.  If you throw down $100 or more I’ll get you a
signed art print of one of my newer pieces.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hello Friends! My name is Ania. I am a mother of four wonderful kids. I am a Baha'i. I weave in spiritual teachings into my daily activities with my children. I noticed that all children are naturally drawn in a powerful way to the animal world. I created the six posters in this campaign to hang in my own home as teaching tools for the kids. The posters were very popular and many were bought by my acquaintances. </p>
<p>At bedtime, or during morning devotions, I thought this would make a wonderful prayer book for parents and children to enjoy together.</p>
<p><i>This prayer book has been approved for publication by the National Spiritual Assembly of the Baha'is of Canada. </i></p>
<p>With your help these beautiful images and inspiring Writings can find their way to the homes and hearts of the world! </p>
<p>Animals are very special to me and this prayer book will help attract children's hearts to be kind to the animal world. In the Baha'i Writings we are encouraged to show the utmost kindness to animals. With the animals in this book as inspiration, we can educate our children to develop the capacities of compassion and kindness to all life.</p>
<h3><strong>Inspirational Quotes</strong></h3>
<p><i>""He should show kindness to animals, how much more unto his fellow man"" - Baha'u'llah</i></p>
<p><i>""Therefore one must be very considerate towards animals and show greater kindness to them than to man. Educate the children in their infancy in such a way that they may become exceedingly kind and merciful to the animals. If an animal is sick they should endeavor to cure it; if it is hungry, they should feed it; if it is thirsty, they should satisfy its thirst; if it is tired, they should give it rest."" - Abdu'l-Baha</i></p>
<p><i>""To the blessed animals, however, the utmost kindness should be exercised: the more the better it will be."" - Abdu'l-Baha</i></p>
<p><i>""Unless ye must,<br/>Bruise not the serpent in the dust,<br/>How much less wound a man,<br/>And if ye can,<br/>No ant should ye alarm,<br/>Much less a brother harm.""  - Abdu'l-Baha</i></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I need $3000 Canadian to print 500 board books. There will be 16 pages with full colour photographs. The six posters you see in this campaign will be included as well as 10 new photos and quotations! You will see a lion, tiger, sea turtle, rhino and more!</p>
<p>As a contributor, you have the option of receiving photographs, books, posters or a custom made poster just for you!</p>
<p>If this campaign doesn't raise all the funds, I hope to be able to fund the remainder myself. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This book of prayers and spiritual Writings will create opportunities for parents and children have a morning or evening cuddle and nourish their spirits. Toddlers and children of all ages will enjoy the beautiful photos and as the child grows the Writings will provide moments for reflection and spiritual growth.</p>
<p>We have a limited number of prayer books for children in Canada in the Baha'i Community. This prayer book captures children's fascination with animals as well as offering spiritual guidance. I am certain it will create lush teaching moments and your children will anticipate prayer time with joyful hearts!</p>

<p><span><br/></span></p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>The things we need in order to put together the show and their costs add up quickly.  The most important aspect of the exhibition is that it makes a lasting positive impression.  We achieve this by putting together a catalog of our work.  This gives us something to put forth as we transition into the professional artist community.  In addition to the catalogs, we are also responsible for:</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>Materials for pedestals, partitions, and other displays</li>
<li>Catering for the opening reception</li>
<li>Hired security</li>
<li>Postcards and invitations to get the word out</li>
</ul>
<div>We spend tremendous amounts of time in our studios to produce this work.  The funds we raise don't offset the cost of making, but they will allow us the benefit of learning how to budget and plan an exhibition of this magnitude.</div>
<div><br/></div> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>Your contribution matters.  This exhibition not only prepares us for the challenges of putting together professional gallery shows, but also for the stress of raising funds to do so.  Art is an important part of culture; as craftspeople, we make valuable contributions to society; we shape that culture and its history.  Think about how identifiable periods in history are: does the word 'Victorian' draw up a certain image?  How about 'The Roaring 20s'?  We can picture these historical movements because of the art and craft that came out of them.  This is what we are doing today.  We are striving to bring craftsmanship back into the public eye.  This exhibition is just a small part of that, but it is a centerpiece of the Philadelphia crafts community each year.  Your contribution helps to illuminate the importance of art to the general public and helps to keep events like this free to attend.</p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p>We understand that you may not be in a position to contribute.  Of course, we will spout the old adage 'every dollar counts!'  However, should you be unable to make a donation, we would be very grateful if you could help make some noise about our campaign.</p>
<p>Indiegogo has those very convenient little tools at the bottom to make it easy for you to share this on all of your social media platforms!  Please just hit 'share' and spread the word so we can spread the word and gain steam to plan an exciting, successful exhibition.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>And please... join us on May 1st to celebrate our work!</p>

   What We Need & What You Get The things we need in order to put together the show and their costs add up quickly.  The most important aspect of the exhibition is that it makes a lasting positive impression.  We achieve this by putting together a catalog of our work.  This gives us something to put forth as we transition into the professional artist community.  In addition to the catalogs, we are also responsible for:


Materials for pedestals, partitions, and other displays
Catering for the opening reception
Hired security
Postcards and invitations to get the word out

We spend tremendous amounts of time in our studios to produce this work.  The funds we raise don't offset the cost of making, but they will allow us the benefit of learning how to budget and plan an exhibition of this magnitude.
   The Impact Your contribution matters.  This exhibition not only prepares us for the challenges of putting together professional gallery shows, but also for the stress of raising funds to do so.  Art is an important part of culture; as craftspeople, we make valuable contributions to society; we shape that culture and its history.  Think about how identifiable periods in history are: does the word 'Victorian' draw up a certain image?  How about 'The Roaring 20s'?  We can picture these historical movements because of the art and craft that came out of them.  This is what we are doing today.  We are striving to bring craftsmanship back into the public eye.  This exhibition is just a small part of that, but it is a centerpiece of the Philadelphia crafts community each year.  Your contribution helps to illuminate the importance of art to the general public and helps to keep events like this free to attend.


    Other Ways You Can Help We understand that you may not be in a position to contribute.  Of course, we will spout the old adage 'every dollar counts!'  However, should you be unable to make a donation, we would be very grateful if you could help make some noise about our campaign.
Indiegogo has those very convenient little tools at the bottom to make it easy for you to share this on all of your social media platforms!  Please just hit 'share' and spread the word so we can spread the word and gain steam to plan an exciting, successful exhibition.

<p><strong>About the Exhibit</strong></p>
<p>Art for All Spaces is breaking new ground with its boldest exhibition to date: <i>The Monument as Art: Commemoration and Controversy.</i>  We need your support to fund this innovative exhibition at the CityArts Factory in Orlando Florida. The aim of the exhibit is to recognize the monument as an object of influence in the public sphere and to generate dialogue about the role of the monument in contemporary society. This is the first art exhibit to date to address the recent controversies surrounding public monuments.  We expect a terrific turnout and show of support!  The public is invited to attend the opening reception on Thursday, April 19th from 6-9 PM at the CityArts Factory in Orlando Florida.  A secondary opening featuring brief gallery talks by local scholars and professionals will take place at CityArts Factory on May 3, 2018 from 6:00-9:00 pm. </p>
<p><strong>The Inspiration </strong></p>
<p>Monuments are commanding public attention like never before, from the near daily removal of confederate-era statues to the hotly contested reversal of national monument protections. The controversy surrounding monuments in the United States and abroad is a testament to their power and importance in the public sphere.  The word ‘monument’ derives from the Latin monumentum, which can be translated as ‘something that reminds.’ Monuments remind us that we cannot run from history, however disgraceful it may be. But do we really want such reminders in public spaces, and should the oppressive symbolism of certain historical monuments go unchallenged? Should new monuments reflecting contemporary values, challenges and concerns replace those reflecting the values of a by-gone era? How are visual artists responding to the many questions and conflicts generated by monuments, past and present? </p>
<p><i>The Monument as Art: Commemoration and Controversy</i> takes on these challenging issues.  The exhibition will feature artists’ responses to monuments, past, present and future. Exhibited works will include concept sketches and maquettes of proposed monuments, as well as works addressing existing public statues of historical figures, national monuments, ancient monuments, digital, ephemeral, and non-traditional expressions of remembrance.</p>
<p><strong>What we need</strong></p>
<p>Art for All Spaces is seeking to raise $2,000 in contributions to produce this exhibit.  Major expenses include rental of gallery space, payment to gallery assistants to install the show, payment to guest speakers, catering, production of posters, marketing and other miscellaneous costs.</p>
<p>Are you a fan of any of the following artists?  Samantha Shumaker, Danny Rock, Diego Ocampa, Jessica King, Bonnie Sprung, Scotty Culpepper, Linda Brant, Marsha Debroske, Doris Smart, Patricia Byron, Cathy Hempel, Scott Fraizer, Tr3, Parker Sketch, Josh Garrick, Janae Corrado, Peter Forster,Richard Reep, Kayla Prommersberger, Paul Vicente ,Natasha Schaidt. Saulius Jankaskaus, Irma Kirveilne as well as students from Lake Highland Preparatory School!  Did you know that your contribution directly supports these artists? With your support, participating artists are able to show their work without having to pay a submission fee.  </p>
<p>Please help by giving any amount ($5.00 or more) to fund this important endeavor. </p>
<p><strong>Why support Art for All Spaces?</strong></p>
<p>Art for All Spaces produces quality exhibits that focus not only on visual appeal and revenue generation but also on education, learning, dialogue and interaction. ­ Galleries and exhibition spaces in the Orlando, Florida area have traditionally been reluctant to produce exhibitions that challenge viewers to consider the sometimes thorny interface between contemporary social issues and visual art. Art for All Spaces has an impressive track record of developing thought-provoking exhibits that generate dialogue and community engagement.</p>
<p><strong>Our Track Record</strong></p>
<p>Our track record speaks for itself. For the past five years, Art for All Spaces has been hosting exhibits at the CityArts Factory in Orlando.  These shows have included:</p>
<ul>
<li>I Believe (2013): An extraordinary exhibit pairing poetry with visual art and featuring a viewer’s choice award.   </li>
<li>Reviving the Ancients (2014): Exploring connections between the ancient past and the present, this show featured interpretive talks by three guest speakers from local colleges and universities at the secondary opening.  </li>
<li>Eureka! The Moment When Art and Science Collide (2016): In this exhibit, artists showcased work involving the many fortuitous intersections between art and science</li>
<li>Theatrix! (2017): The theatrical aspects of life and art were featured in this exhibit, along with a special performance by Phantasmagoria at the secondary opening.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How You Can Help</strong></p>
<p>Our goal is to offer professional, emerging and student artists the opportunity to exhibit work addressing the role of monuments in contemporary society, and to produce a one-of-a-kind educational exhibit that promotes community learning, dialogue and exchange.   You can help us accomplish our goal by making a contribution.  The success of this campaign depends on many small contributions. You can also help by sharing this campaign with others who love the arts and want to help make <i>The Monument as Art: Commemoration and Controversy</i> a reality.  </p>

<h2>The Temple for Christchurch</h2>
<p>The Temple for Christchurch is a community mental health initiative based on the Temple at Burning Man in the Unites States. It is driven by the need for emotional healing in Christchurch after the prolonged upheaval and stress caused by the Canterbury earthquakes which have shaken the city for the past two years.</p>
<p>We are building the Temple on a central city site where once finished it will be opened to the public who will be invited to write their earthquake experiences on its’ walls. After two weeks it will be de-constructed, taken out of the city, reconstructed, and ceremonially burned.</p>
<h3>Who's involved?</h3>
<p>This is a project of the Temple for Christchurch Trust and involves several core members of the International Arts Megacrew (builders of the Temple of Transition at Burning Man 2011) and Kiwiburn (New Zealand's regional Burning Man event).</p>
<h3>Why donate?</h3>
<p>By donating, you are helping us gift the Temple experience to a large group of people who are in need of the healing that it has to offer. Everyone in Christchurch has their own story to tell. The earthquakes were a constant threat, they just kept coming, and most people have not been able to deal with the trauma that these events have left behind. Emotional healing has been set aside as survival becomes priority number one. We hope that through this process we can offer people a way to deal with these emotions and to begin moving on with life.</p>
<h3>Where's the money going?</h3>
<p>All money raised through this campaign will go to the Temple for Christchurch Trust which is a registered charity in New Zealand. As a registered charity, 100% of the money raised must be put towards the Trust’s charitable purpose.</p>
<p>The money will be used to fund core resources needed to build the Temple, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Structural timber for the subframe.</li>
<li>Vehicle costs for collecting demolition timber.</li>
<li>Nails, screws and nail plates.</li>
<li>Saw blades and other consumables.</li>
<li>Foundations to hold the structure down.</li>
<li>Transporting the Temple to the burn site.</li>
<li>Consent and permit fees.</li>
</ul><h3>Other ways you can help</h3>
<p>If you can't afford to donate to our campaign you can still help:</p>

<h3>The design</h3>
<p>The Temple design is based on the seismic data taken from the Heathcote Valley Station during the February 22 earthquake, the largest and most damaging of the earthquakes to hit Christchurch. These waveforms inspired the shape and dimensions of the structure, with the central line of cones corresponding to peaks in the acceleration readout, while the shape of the waves reaching out from the centre are taken from the velocity. The finished structure will be approximately 40m long, 25m wide, and will reach 6.3m at it highest point. This creates a visual interpretation of the earthquake itself.</p>

<p>The cladding will be placed upon a structural subframe which has been designed by engineers. This subframe will be made from a mix of recycled and new timber.</p>
<h3>Project progress</h3>
<p>We are currently building the Temple on the old Convention Centre site. The convention centre, like many buildings around it, has been demolished due to damage caused during the earthquakes.

<h3>Who we are</h3>
<p>The Temple for Christchurch project is created entirely by volunteers. Members of it's core team include four of the organisers of Kiwiburn, New Zealand's regional Burning Man event; several temple builders from Kiwiburn, Burning Seed (Australia) and Burning Man (USA); and “Kiwi” Chris Hankins, the project lead for the Temple of Transition at Burning Man 2011.</p>
<h3>Why the Temple for Christchurch is needed</h3>
<p>Since September 4, 2010 the Canterbury region in New Zealand has experienced over 10,000 earthquakes. More than 40 of these were magnitude 5.0 or over and four were over magnitude 6.0. It has been a seemingly endless series of shakes and every time we thought we were getting back on our feet, another quake hit and we were brought back to square one.</p>
<p>The worst earthquake occurred on February 22, 2011. Although it only registered as a magnitude 6.3 , the energy it released was huge. On the Mercalli intensity scale the quake measured 9 out of 12 making it one of the largest earthquakes ever measured near an urban centre. Several buildings collapsed and 185 people died on this tragic day.</p>
<p>As a result of these series of quakes , large parts of the central city have been severely damaged with estimates as high as 80% of it needing to be demolished. Thousands of homes have been physically destroyed and nearly 7000 more are on land that has been determined to be uninhabitable by the New Zealand government. Families have been displaced and communities destroyed.</p>
<p>Most of the central city was immediately cordoned off after February 22 and large parts are still cordoned off to this day; it's been like that for over two years. We are only just starting to move into the rebuild stage. Held up by insurance companies and bureaucratic problems, thousands of people are still living in damaged homes. It's no surprise that the region has the highest anti-depressant prescription rate in the country. There has been an immensely prolonged disruption of daily life and many people are suffering from post traumatic stress.</p>
<p>Needless to say, life has been tough in Christchurch.</p></div>","Donations through this campaign are NOT tax deductible.

The Temple for Christchurch
The Temple for Christchurch is a community mental health initiative based on the Temple at Burning Man in the Unites States. It is driven by the need for emotional healing in Christchurch after the prolonged upheaval and stress caused by the Canterbury earthquakes which have shaken the city for the past two years.
We are building the Temple on a central city site where once finished it will be opened to the public who will be invited to write their earthquake experiences on its’ walls. After two weeks it will be de-constructed, taken out of the city, reconstructed, and ceremonially burned.
Who's involved?
This is a project of the Temple for Christchurch Trust and involves several core members of the International Arts Megacrew (builders of the Temple of Transition at Burning Man 2011) and Kiwiburn (New Zealand's regional Burning Man event).
Why donate?
By donating, you are helping us gift the Temple experience to a large group of people who are in need of the healing that it has to offer. Everyone in Christchurch has their own story to tell. The earthquakes were a constant threat, they just kept coming, and most people have not been able to deal with the trauma that these events have left behind. Emotional healing has been set aside as survival becomes priority number one. We hope that through this process we can offer people a way to deal with these emotions and to begin moving on with life.
Where's the money going?
All money raised through this campaign will go to the Temple for Christchurch Trust which is a registered charity in New Zealand. As a registered charity, 100% of the money raised must be put towards the Trust’s charitable purpose.
The money will be used to fund core resources needed to build the Temple, including:

Structural timber for the subframe.
Vehicle costs for collecting demolition timber.
Nails, screws and nail plates.
Saw blades and other consumables.
Foundations to hold the structure down.
Transporting the Temple to the burn site.
Consent and permit fees.

About the Temple for Christchurch
The Temple for Christchurch rendered into the build site.
The design
The Temple design is based on the seismic data taken from the Heathcote Valley Station during the February 22 earthquake, the largest and most damaging of the earthquakes to hit Christchurch. These waveforms inspired the shape and dimensions of the structure, with the central line of cones corresponding to peaks in the acceleration readout, while the shape of the waves reaching out from the centre are taken from the velocity. The finished structure will be approximately 40m long, 25m wide, and will reach 6.3m at it highest point. This creates a visual interpretation of the earthquake itself.
Building materials
The pile of demolition wood used to collect materials for the Temple.
The Temple will be clad with recycled wood gathered from city-wide demolition sites. With so many houses and other buildings being demolished there is no shortage of materials to be used. After collection, the wood is de-nailed and then ripped into slices to be used as cladding.
The cladding will be placed upon a structural subframe which has been designed by engineers. This subframe will be made from a mix of recycled and new timber.

<p>We are Frida Alvinzi and Raisa Veikkola, a creative partnership called ‘Theatre of Dolls’ and are based in London. We produce four-dimensional art pieces, using puppets as storytellers and our bodies as sculptural landscapes, creating the illusion that alternative realities are alive. We handcraft all the puppets, costumes and sets using mainly recycled materials and found objects from nature as media. We have worked together for six years and have created seven productions so far. You can view our previous work <a href=""http://theatreofdolls.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here</a>.</p>
<p>We have received a great reception from our performances and have performed in venues such as Tate Modern, Barbican and Victoria &amp; Albert Museum and also in galleries, festivals and events worldwide.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The project:</p>
<p>We want to stage <em>Dolls of Love, </em>a production investigating the concept of love; from the myth of the origin of love in Plato’s Symposium, to the definition and universal meaning of the concept. The narrative, which will be mainly told by puppets and dolls, is loosely based on the story of Cupid and Psyche, but the core of the performance is to create a visual poem that we will be physically part of. We are using the ideas of Russian dolls and dolls houses as visual references for the costumes and sets.</p>
<p>This piece is aimed at an adult audience and it will be 40 minutes long. We are currently on the production stage of the project and want to take it on tour from November through all of next year and perform it in venues across the UK, Europe and U.S.A. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>What we would like you to fund:</p>
<p>We are looking for funding to cover some of our production costs; mainly for the costumes, sets and equipment, and the film and soundtrack production that is incorporated in the performance. Creating each production is a painstaking process as we handcraft every element of it, from every puppet to the costume, sets and sound. This production is our most ambitions project yet so any sum is extremely helpful.</p>

<p style=""margin-top: .1pt; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: .1pt; margin-left: 0in;""><span style=""font-family: Verdana; color: black;"">            I have always drawn inspiration for my artwork from my passion for the outdoors and exterior landscapes. As an avid hiker, I try to spend as much time outdoors as possible.  My on-site paintings are direct reflections of my experiences in and with nature.</span></p>
<p style=""margin-top: .1pt; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: .1pt; margin-left: 0in;""><span style=""font-family: Verdana; color: black;"">            When I am hiking or camping, I bring my supplies along to create paintings and drawings of my surroundings.  Usually, I wonder around the woods exploring the creeks and riverbeds until I find a solitary place to paint.  This process of exploration is quite meditative and the act of drawing or painting the specific location allows me the time to sit and reflect within the space.  Although it is sometimes troublesome to carry an easel, canvases, and painting supplies while climbing over rocks and through trails, I enjoy the process.  The challenge makes the trek even more worthwhile.</span></p>
<p style=""margin-top: .1pt; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: .1pt; margin-left: 0in;""><span style=""font-family: Verdana; color: black;"">         I take similar walks in the city where I have experimented with a variety of media including painting, printmaking and video.  At first I struggled to find inspiration in the city environment until I realized what an interesting relationship I had been witnessing between the urban and natural landscapes.  Since recognizing this fascinating juxtaposition, I have found myself exploring the city and the wilderness as much as possible, finding solitary space to paint, photograph, or film these environments.  It is the process of the walk and the exploration that is the backbone of my work.</span></p>
<p style=""margin-top: .1pt; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: .1pt; margin-left: 0in;""><span style=""font-family: Verdana; color: black;"">        Over the last few years, I had the opportunity to explore and travel in Arizona, Colorado, and the Canyonlands of Utah. These places struck an emotive vein within me.  Backpacking, hiking, and painting in landscapes of catcti, canyons, and unbroken horizons inspired me to create new works on a greater scale and higher level than I was able to do back home. Ever since these perspective broadening experiences, I have sought out opportunities to return to the West. </span></p>

<p style=""margin-top: .1pt; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: .1pt; margin-left: 0in;""><span style=""font-family: Verdana; color: black;""> </span></p></div>","Hi, my name is Amy Leggin and I am a visual artist living in Baltimore City, Maryland.  I graduated from the Maryland Institute College of Art in 2008 where I received a BFA in painting.  Since graduating, I have been working on a series of onsite outdoor paintings as well as a number of landscape-inspired abstract pieces.
 
Painting on Location
            I have always drawn inspiration for my artwork from my passion for the outdoors and exterior landscapes. As an avid hiker, I try to spend as much time outdoors as possible.  My on-site paintings are direct reflections of my experiences in and with nature.
            When I am hiking or camping, I bring my supplies along to create paintings and drawings of my surroundings.  Usually, I wonder around the woods exploring the creeks and riverbeds until I find a solitary place to paint.  This process of exploration is quite meditative and the act of drawing or painting the specific location allows me the time to sit and reflect within the space.  Although it is sometimes troublesome to carry an easel, canvases, and painting supplies while climbing over rocks and through trails, I enjoy the process.  The challenge makes the trek even more worthwhile.
         I take similar walks in the city where I have experimented with a variety of media including painting, printmaking and video.  At first I struggled to find inspiration in the city environment until I realized what an interesting relationship I had been witnessing between the urban and natural landscapes.  Since recognizing this fascinating juxtaposition, I have found myself exploring the city and the wilderness as much as possible, finding solitary space to paint, photograph, or film these environments.  It is the process of the walk and the exploration that is the backbone of my work.
        Over the last few years, I had the opportunity to explore and travel in Arizona, Colorado, and the Canyonlands of Utah. These places struck an emotive vein within me.  Backpacking, hiking, and painting in landscapes of catcti, canyons, and unbroken horizons inspired me to create new works on a greater scale and higher level than I was able to do back home. Ever since these perspective broadening experiences, I have sought out opportunities to return to the West. 
 
Landscape Inspired Abstraction
           An important aspect of my creative process comes after my exploration of outdoor space.  Once I have stood, sat, climbed, descended, observed scenes, recognized smells, and felt breezes, I return to my studio space with a clear sensory memory of my recent experience.  I then use highly expressive motions to create and translate the memory of my experience that now exists within my psyche into a visual manifestation.
           This after-image has been really important to my work because I can see the reflections of the purity of nature as well as those of my closer surroundings; the dismal parts of a city, the litter and dirt, the homeless and the addicted.  Our societal relationship with nature and the man-made world has always been a strange and dynamic relationship. 
 
Teaching
           Since my graduation I have been fortunate to work with a number of great students and instructors at the Griffin Art Center in Frederick, Maryland.  At the Griffin I teach children’s art classes on the basics of drawing and painting, and elementary techniques for abstract painting.  I also work at Rivers Edge Learning Center, a pre-school and day-care where I am the regular substitute teacher.  Both of these teaching situations have been really beneficial for me.  I enjoy working with children and I feel that while I teach them new things, they tend to also teach me.
 
Glacier National Park, Artist In Residence
          Glacier National Park is one of the largest and most intact ecosystems in North America.  It was the world’s first International Peace Park, created when Wateron Lakes Park in Canada and Glacier National Park in Montana joined in 1932. This monumental park is home to more than 700 lakes, dozens of glaciers, and a plethora of wildlife.
           Every year the park staff selects two artists to live in the park and make work as a reflection of their time spent in Glacier.  I am proud to have been selected as the artist-in-residence for August 2013.  I am very eager and excited to have the time and space to quietly reflect and create within this effervescent landscape.  I am hoping that by creating work that reflects the pure beauty of this space, I can raise awareness about Glacier and its importance to the natural world.
           While in the residency, I will participate in a number of public programs that include painting demonstrations and informational sessions with children and other park-goers about artists and their relationship to the park.  After the residency I will make a presentation in my hometown where I will talk about my experiences and present my work.  I am hoping that my experience can highlight the importance of preserving this natural place and sustaining its thriving eco-system.
 
Why I need your help!
           In order for me to participate in this residency, I need to be physically and mentally prepared.  I will be living in a small cabin that the park has provided for me.  Aside from the cabin, I need to provide all of my other supplies: food, gear, painting/drawing materials and transportation.  I am going to begin my trip almost two weeks in advance to make the long haul across the country from Maryland to Northern Montana.  I am in need of certain colors of paints that I have been unable to afford, new painting surfaces, sketchbooks, and possibly some of my other living costs such as some food and water.  I would deeply appreciate your help in preparing me for this amazing experience by making a donation to my site.  I am sincerely grateful for your time and generosity, and I look forward to sharing my journey with you.

<p></p></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></div>","Recently, with ""Hot Shot Tragedies"" and ""Wildfires at Our Door"", we have all become acutely aware by experiencing first hand the sacrifices and dedication our heroic firefighters and first responders across the country are making on our behalves. Our Dalmatian sculpture project was borne out of the devastating emotions brought about by the impact of 9/11 and the subsequent onslaught of wildfires and terrorist acts.

Artists KAREN & TONY BARONE are fundraising to donate their larger-than-life bright blue “R. HERO” Dalmatian puppy sculpture honoring firefighters & first responders to the City of Palm Springs, CA and the people of the Coachella Valley.
Karen & Tony are a legendary artist couple
working side by side in the execution of their very large-scale sculpture and
paintings. This extraordinarily creative husband and wife team’s works have
been exhibited and acquired by individuals, cities & museums
worldwide.


The all aluminum 6’-2” tall shimmering bright blue “R. HERO” outdoor
sculpture honoring firefighters and first responders has been approved by the City Council for installation in front of Palm Springs Fire Station #3, (on Racquet
Club Drive across from Victoria Park and down from The Buena Vista Elementary
School). 
As
a gift to the City “R. HERO” will
become a permanent & significant part of the City’s Art-in-Public-Places
collection and a vital teaching tool for its citizens, especially the children.

The artists have created ""R. HERO"" as a unique
series of sculptures to be installed at public sites: children’s museums, children's hospitals,
municipal buildings, fire stations, schools, parks and other not-for-profits,
to honor and recognize our valiant firefighters and first responders who
operate in relative obscurity to save, rescue & protect humans and animals
alike. Through the creative & instructive expression of art, the “R. HERO” sculptures serve as a
reminder of their indefatigable heroism. 
Karen & Tony Barone are passionate
about making their “R. HERO” sculptures
available to communities across America – creating a “Dalmation-Nation”.


To date “R. HERO”, Dalmatian puppy sculptures honoring firefighters &
first responders, have been successfully sponsored and gifted to the following not-for-profits:
•The Children’s Discovery Museum of the Desert, Rancho Mirage, CA                                     •The Historical Society of Palm Desert (CA) on El Paseo, the City’s 1st fire station                         •The Children’s Museum of Phoenix (AZ)                                                                        •The EverWonder Children’s Museum of Newtown, Connecticut – “(R.
HERO was selected) as a symbolic, beneficial teaching tool in our well laid-out
plan of having the museum become a part of the cure for this emotionally devastated
community.”              . . . .Kristin Chiriatti, President 











What happens if we surpass
our goal? The short answer is – the more we raise, the more “R. HERO” Dalmatian puppy sculptures honoring firefighters &
first responders we will be able to donate – there is no shortage of deserving
recipients.


We have EXCITING PERKS (see sample image
below) – however, it is acknowledging these unsung heroes that we hope motivates
you to CONTRIBUTE

<p><strong><br/>ENTER THE NUTCRACKER<br/></strong>For two consecutive years (2010-11) Stockton, CA has been deemed the most miserable city in America. The time for change is at hand. The Pierced Ear Poetry Slam team is comprised of members from all different walks of life and located all across California. From Cotati to Santa Cruz, these artists are combining their powers like Planeteers to spread the California love from the local Stockton community all the way to North Carolina. This is the first time Stockton, CA has sent representatives to the annual National Poetry Slam -- any help you give is helping to make West Coast history.</p>

<p><strong><br/>SLAM POETRY<br/></strong>Slam Poetry is a spoken word competition in which poets are given a time limit to read or recite their work and are judged by selected members of the audience. Tracing its origins back to 1984 Chicago, Slam spread to the rest of North America and has touched every continent on the globe.</p>
<p><strong>NATIONAL POETRY SLAM<br/></strong>The National Poetry Slam (NPS) is an annual competition that began in 1990 at Fort Mason in San Francisco, CA with just four competing teams.

<h3>The Effigy</h3>
<p>Ke'el K'aak' meaning ""cold fire"" in Yucaten, the language of the Mayans embody the concept behind our effigy. We propose to build a tiered 14’ x 16’ pyramid reminiscent of Mayan structures found in Chichen Itza and Calakmul, Mexico. Within the walls of the effigy will be a combination of inlaid Mayan patterning and various snow crystal motifs. There will be four archways that let participants enter the structure. Each door will face one of the four cardinal directions: North, South, East or West. In the center of the pyramid will be a 6’ snowman, fabricated out of wood. As the effigy burns the snowman will rise through the pyramid; via a pulley and weight system that we have designed. The snowman will come to rest at the top of the structure until it burns down.</p>

<h3>Here's What We Hope to Accomplish</h3>
<p>I believe the world is out of balance and that we need to listen to women’s voices and understand their intent.  They do not speak up as often as men.  I believe that one of the reasons for this is the systemic violence against women that has been present throughout history.  I think it’s time to take the next step in evolution, to actively create a safe environment for women and to take responsibility for our society.</p>
<p>Truth is Beauty and my other sculptures are intended to demand this change in perspective. They are intended to be catalysts for social change; to de-objectify women and express the basic truth of femininity, a truth that is dangerous for individual women to express.  They are a reminder of what we gain when we value women.  My hope is to inspire men and women to take action to end violence against women, thus allowing all of us to live fully and thrive. </p>

<p>Standing 55 feet tall and weighing 7,000 pounds Truth is Beauty will be constructed using:</p>
<ul>
<li>55,000 single welds</li>
<li>25,000 feet of steel rod and pipe</li>
<li>6,500 steel ball connection points</li>
<li>2,000 square feet of stainless steel mesh</li>
</ul><p>One thousand five hundred (1,500) individual multi-colored LED lights will be distributed throughout her body. These lights will be controlled by a custom iPad application to create a spectacular light show that will enhance and expand the visual experience.</p>
<p><strong>Like Bliss Dance before her, she will be unveiled at Burning Man and then we plan to place her out in the world (Bliss Dance debuted at Burning Man 2010 and has been installed on Treasure Island in San Francisco since 2011.) </strong></p>

<h3><strong>My Inspiration</strong></h3>
<p><img alt=""1/3 Life Size Bronze Truth is Beauty"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://katyboynton.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/IGG-Bronze.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: right; margin: 10px;"" title=""1/3 Life Size Bronze Truth is Beauty""/>The story of Truth is Beauty and The Bliss Project began when I was 7-years old and my best friend was a 9-year old little girl.  One day I was told, in way too much detail for a little boy, that she had been raped right outside of my house.  It was incomprehensible, horrible, I never forgot, I never understood...it still haunts me.  I thought...that man couldn't have realized my friend was a person, that if he really could see her, this wouldn't have happened.</p>
<p>I grew up in the Bay Area in the 60's and 70's, in the philosophical revolution and turbulence of those times.  I learned to deeply appreciate feminine energy, influence and strength…and realized that the objectification of women imprisoned women and also men.  I also saw first-hand that one person, or a small group of people, can start a movement that can make a difference and change the course of history.</p>
<p>In my 20s I discovered sculpting, and in particular, the joy of seeing and then sculpting women; of the healing energy and power that I saw when women were not afraid...when they could be present, when they could be themselves, speak their minds...and the heroism it takes to do this in the face of real danger in their daily lives.  For more than 25 years I have been sculpting women.  At first glance, they appear to be classical figurative nudes, but they are not.  They are radically modern...revolutionary.   These women are safe, present. Look at them. They have chosen their own expression, so you will see the actual woman, the person, her energy and spirit.  It is my intent that these sculptures exude this healing energy and inspire us to take action; to finally say enough is enough.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>How You Can Help!</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Right now we are raising money so that we can complete Truth is Beauty!</strong></p>
<p>She began her journey as a bronze sculpture in 2007.  Using a pantograph — a medieval-era enlargement tool — she is being built by hand using classical sculpting techniques from my life-size original, first to an 18 ft clay version and then to her final 55 ft steel form. In 2011, with the help of generous donors and an amazing crew, we brought the 30 ft torso to the Playa. This year we have been awarded a grant from Burning Man toward her completion, but the grant does not cover all of our costs. </p>
<p><strong>Now, we need funds to cover materials (steel, stainless steel mesh, nuts, bolts, screws, welding materials) waterjet parts, insurance, rent, transportation, certified welders, structural engineers, heavy equipment, lighting and the list goes on.</strong>  If we go above our goal, we will be able to support the people who have dedicated themselves to bringing this project to life.  They have already put in months of work to get her to this phase of the build!  </p>
<p><strong>Please donate what you can, but also, and just as importantly, we really need you to collaborate with us on how we can take this healing out into the world.</strong>  These pieces are about taking action together.  We have already heard great ideas from the community.  One idea that comes from my friend, Aaron Schiller, is a reflection circle around the base of Truth is Beauty (in the form of two circles of chairs facing each other) where men and women will be invited to share their own true person with each other, thus “empowering each other to be stewards of the truth, the respect and the beauty that is man/women existence on this planet.”  Another idea that comes from my friend Aaryn Herridge, is to give anyone who is inspired by Truth is Beauty the opportunity to write a healing letter, a letter of hope, to be delivered to a young girl or woman affected by violence.  My letter would say ""I am sorry that happened to you.  I am standing with you. I will do what I can to stop this.""  What would your letter say? What is your idea? </p>
<p>So please visit our website at <a href=""http://www.blissdance.us"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.blissdance.us</a> where we are asking for and sharing your ideas as well!</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>The Bottom Line</strong></h3>
<p>Art can illuminate the human condition and be a catalyst to social change ...it can foment revolution and, with your help, art can help change human consciousness around violence against women and begin a healing process that will make room for women’s voices! I am asking you to stand with us!</p>

UPDATE:  Yay, thanks to all of you we made our Indiegogo goal early!!! We are so grateful for all of the love and support!!  It's not to late to keep it going though...Any donations above our minimum goal will be used to help compensate those who have already dedicated 100s and 1,000s of hours to help build Truth is Beauty, fund planned actions and activities on playa, as well as to starting the next and final sculpture in the Bliss Project, R-evolution, which we plan to start working on when we return from Burning Man 2013. Pendants are still available and the support and share campaign is still in effect!

The story of Truth is Beauty and The Bliss Project began when I was 7-years old and my best friend was a 9-year old little girl.  One day I was told, in way too much detail for a little boy, that she had been raped right outside of my house.  It was incomprehensible, horrible, I never forgot, I never understood...it still haunts me.  I thought...that man couldn't have realized my friend was a person, that if he really could see her, this wouldn't have happened.

<h4 style=""text-align: justify;"">‘Sapfo Fest’ is a first independent community-initiated festival in the
Baltics aimed at combating discriminatory practices against LBTQI. A
community-led festival, the ‘Sapfo Fest’ seeks to empower the LBTQI community
and combat prejudice and discrimination, as well as increase visibility of
LBTQI individuals in Lithuania and Eastern Europe more generally. </h4>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">For the third year in a row the Festival will be strengthening ties among LBTQI individuals by bringing people together into a shared space
and providing knowledge related to LGBTQI situation internationally and in
Lithuania. </p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">This year, through lectures and workshops as well as the LGBTQI art, the
‘Sapfo Fest’ will take a closer look at the ‘identity’. How do we shape our
gender, how do (not) conform to the normative roles, and how it affects our
identities? How it unites/divides us? How it relates to other LBTQI
problematics and issues?</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">In addition, the festival will bring together the queer scene
faces in Lithuania to the ‘Sapfo Fest’. A well know poet and an art critic
Laima Kreivytė, a queer poet and activist Gabrielė Labanauskaitė, Neringa
Danngvydė, a writer, whose fairy tale book was banned because of its homosexual
content, among others. With its diverse educational program – from Soviet
mental institutions for lesbians to today‘s trans* rights – the ‘Sapfo Fest”
hopes to create a learning, sharing, and appreciative space for everybody.</p>
<h2>Background:</h2>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Lithuania is a post-Soviet ‘transitioning’ democracy, which gained its
independence from Russia in  1990.;  Lithuania, just like Russia, maintains
national laws that are directly and overtly discriminating against LGBTQI
individuals, and many oppressive ‘values’, perceptions
and practices regarding LGBTQI have remained despite the material changes of
the  last twenty-five  years. As an example, our national Pride
Parade can only be arranged under heavy police protection due to verbal threats
and physical attacks by organised right-wing groups, and both our love life and
attempts at organising is routinely attacked by high ranking members of leading
political parties. Consequently, our private lives and individual
determination; as well as our right to freedom of expression and freedom of
association is constantly under threat. </p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Whereas the visibility of gay men in Lithuania has been growing steadily
and quite a few male artists and entertainers 'have come out' publicly, the
women’s community remains largely ignored and marginalised. </p>
<h2>Earlier festivals</h2>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Back in 2012, two community members - Sandra and Agne - organized
the first ever LBTQI festival in Lithuania - 'PiLeFe' (acronym for 'Angry
Lesbians' Festival'). Over the last two years (2012 &amp; 2013) the
pioneers of the festival have provided a platform for the LBTQI community
in Lithuania to strengthen ties through various cultural and educational
activities, share ideas and brainstorm new projects. Even without any
institutional support, the festival has proved a great success and attracted
around 90 participants last year. </p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Only around 30 participants out of 90 are in the photograph from the ‘PiLeFe’
of 2013. In our current political and social climate in Lithuania, most of
them are prevented from publicly sharing their faces with you due to potential
humiliation, bullying and discrimination, as well as physical safety
issues within both professional and personal circles. </p>
<h2>
<b>New vision</b> </h2><p style=""text-align: justify;"">This year the organizational committee has increased and now includes 13 human rights activists, who combine their
experience, knowledge, passion and determination for advancing the goals
of LBTQI community and more inclusive society. Organizers come from
various backgrounds and have both national and international LBTQI
advocacy experience. Some community members returned to Lithuania
after getting their degrees and activism experience in London, New York,
Athens, Barcelona &amp; many other places, and combined their energy and
passion with the ones who have been working in Lithuania and contributing to
the ‘Baltic Pride’ in 2010 and 2013, among others. Our vision is to grow
with the Festival and attract way more participants this year, who could
benefit from the Festival's shared space, educational, cultural and artistic
activities. </p>
<h2><b>New face</b></h2><p style=""text-align: justify;"">Although the organizers
strongly believe that community-building needs to be continued, however, they
also think that more visibility, awareness-raising and representation are
needed for the LBTQI community and women in Lithuania on political and
public level. Therefore this year in addition to the various artistic,
educational and cultural events, the Festival aims to provide a platform for
connecting with a public and 'coming out.' Willing LBTQI community
members, who include well-known arts &amp; cultural scene
individuals, will openly communicate and 'come out' for the media and
public. Thus the Festival in itself will seek to encourage the
Lithuanian society to acknowledge the existence and marginalization of the
LBTQI community and open up a dialogue for future collaborations. </p>

aimed for at least 200 - 300 community members. To make our vision a reality,
we are looking for possible contributions so we could cover the direct costs,
such as rent of the festival space, food, sound and multimedia equipment. Anything over this amount will go to cover
lecturers’ travel expenses and stretch goals in inviting and paying for the
travel expenses for other LBTQI rights organizations in the post-Soviet sphere. All activists are devoting their time

<p>The monolith itself is a representation of peace and evolution. Given the the sequel to 2001 was the Arthur C. Clarke book 2010 from 1982 which was quickly made into a film, it seemed appropriate given the nature of this event to bring it to life at Burning Man this year.</p>
<p><strong>A quick story about the life of this project so far: why is this funding so late?</strong><br/>
Though the concept was sewn in December 2009, it was proposed and sent to Burning Man by February. A partner joined and we were going to amplify the project by making it interactive. Partner bailed, 3 funding attempts to get $3k faltered miserably, and finally the structure that was built so far was stolen just recently.</p>
<p><strong>This Rendition</strong><br/>
Because of all the changes and the refusal to go empty handed, adding the desire to bring to life what this represents to me, I forged ahead with a newly realized static version.</p>
<p>Will build a box  in the same proportions 9′ x 4′ x 1′ out of plywood:</p>

<p>x place a polyurethane coat around it to make the surface smooth</p>

<p>x mount on steel tracks that will be used to anchor into the ground with re-bar posts.</p>

<p>This project is:</p>
<p>x an homage to Kubrick and Clarke for their vision in 2001: A Space Odyssey; with notes on 2010</p>
<p>x a representation of peace and a message of evolution of the planet</p>
<p>x and is is a beautiful representation of Kubrick’s translation of the monolith from the movies</p>
<p>This is a much more simplified version of the original concept. It will not be sustaining in it’s form and will not probably come back from Burning Man as a result. Hopefully, with better planning and realistic strategy future expressions will prove to be more of an asset both sustaining and environmentally friendly.</p>

<h3><em>IMPORTANT UPDATE</em></h3>
<p>Please note: In the midst of our initial fundraising attempt, we enjoyed an important ""update conversation"" with the community of Newtown, Connecticut. A commission to determine quantity and site placement of selected monument donations was just being formed—and the community asked us to postpone our significant efforts until they had made their final evaluations.</p>
<p>Although our project previously received excellent feedback from community stakeholders—and we expect more from this commission—we agreed to restart our campaign after hearing from the new group.</p>
<p>Please check back for important developments, and thanks for your support!</p>
<h3>Our Inspiration</h3>
<p>Unfortunately, we all have become familiar with tragedy—and we're REALLY familiar with feeling powerless to help people who are far away. With this awesome project, we're going to cast a 13-foot bronze monument and donate it to Newtown, Connecticut. The figure is holding origami cranes, which are symbols of peace and hope.</p>
<p>Participating in this project allows all of us to make a lasting, permanent contribution to the lives of an entire community—and the world.</p>
<p>The piece was sculpted by Lorri Acott, a former teacher who reacted like all of you did when the Newtown tragedy occurred last December. As a sculptor, she is able to express her own deep connection to those who suffer by making artwork. Sculpture is her loudest voice, and it's permanent. By contributing to this project, you can speak with her, and with the community of Hill City, South Dakota.</p>
<p>Lorri is joined in this effort by many. Black Hill Bronze will help with casting and installation. The students at Bethel High School in Bethel, Connecticut began by folding cranes and  have decided to join us in raising money for the big sculpture. The Hill City Arts Council is lending their support, and various people from all over the US are stepping forward to assist in this effo</p>
<p><strong><span style=""font-size: 1.17em;"">What we need &amp; What You Get</span></strong></p>
</div>
<div>We're asking for $70,000 to make this piece and transport it to Newtown. If we receive extra funding, we will enhance the base of the sculpture and landscaping—and if we receive a LOT of extra funding, we'll contribute to the college funds of Sandy Hook Elementary students.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>You get a ton of great perks for participating, from our heartfelt thanks, to sculptures, to in-person visits to our studio and the casting foundry. This is a community project—and the community is getting larger every day. By participating, you join other people who are MAKING A DIFFERENCE. Why not just save the world with art?</div>
<div> </div>
<div>If we don't raise the entire amount during this time, we will begin the casting process and move forward with the sculpture with what we have.  It is important enough to us that we will make it happen either way. Your help will allow us do it in a timely manner, as well as give you the opportunity to be a part of a the transformational power or art.</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The impact of this project will be a permanent memorial that commemorates the strength and resiliency of Newtown—as well as the compassion and hope of the world around Newtown. Our world is small, and we all have to share whatever love and support we can give.</p>
<p>As a sculptor who works in large format, Lorri has experienced the emotion of families and communities who place monuments in public spaces. She's watched people cry and laugh; she's read letters years later from those who have just then seen an important sculpture for the first time.</p>
<p>Monuments literally transform a physical space. They provide a gathering place, a positive aspect to history. All of us involved with this project can't wait to see this particular sculpture, which is called Peace, in this particular community. We can already feel it there.</p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
If this project speaks to you, then please share it! Link, Facebook, Tweet, chat, do whatever you can to spread the word. We already successfully accomplished our first collaborative phase of this project—helping school kids to fold paper origami cranes filled with ""love notes"" and sending them to Newtown. Word of our tiny town's efforts spread like wildfire across the country, and other kids and their schools also folded cranes. Let's do the same with this project! Spread the word.

<h3>Phase One—December 2012</h3>
<p>In cultures around the world, people have used the crane as a symbol of peace and hope—a way to soothe souls of their suffering. Following this tradition, children in Hill City, South Dakota—population 900—sent an irrefutable message of love to the<br/>families in Newtown, Connecticut. They folded origami cranes—embedded with drawings or written prayers, wishes, and personal messages—intended as physical representations of what is impossible to say.</p>
<p>“Each crane is a representation of a prayer,” Lorri Acott said. “One person, one crane, one prayer.”</p>
<p>Bethel, Connecticut, is just minutes away from Newtown, and students in its high school also had started folding cranes, with the hope of creating one string of 1,000 cranes for each of Newtown’s 26 grieving families. Hill City’s cranes first flew to<br/>Bethel to assist with that project—but the dream did not end there. Other communities around the country also provided their own crane “populations.”</p>
<p>“Art has a transformational quality,” Lorri said. “Art gives people a place to put their grief, sorrow, and pain—and a way to begin to transform it. Art gives both children and adults a way to share a silent prayer that cannot be adequately expressed in words—and if anyone needs our prayers right now, it’s the folks in Newtown.”</p>
<p>“This project is a tangible way that people can actually do something to help others—and themselves,” said Kristin Donnan Standard, president of the Hill City Arts Council, the organization that linked Lorri Acott to the school administration, the state arts council, and a video production company that volunteered its services. “This is art at its highest service.”</p>
<p>She said that folding cranes for a particular purpose reminded her of a traditional Native American practice of making prayer ties—in which tobacco is folded into small squares of cotton.</p>
<p>“You really focus your heart while you fold, whether it’s a crane or a tie,” she said. “And when you hang up a string of cranes, it’s like hanging Tibetan prayer flags. You’re putting your message out to God.”</p>
<h3>The Legend of the Crane</h3>
<p>This large and graceful bird is the subject of many legends, thanks to fables claiming that a single crane can live for a thousand years. The fossil record suggests that today’s cranes are probably relatives of the oldest birds on earth, which gives some credence to our human interpretations of their power of endurance.</p>
<p>More than a dozen species of crane inhabit five continents, with the most majestic standing five feet tall with a wingspan of more than seven feet.</p>
<p>The crane has been connected to ideas of joy and the celebration of life since Greek and Roman times, thanks to their association with Apollo, the sun god. Throughout Asia, the crane has symbolized happiness, eternal youth, longevity, and good fortune. In some legends, these powerful birds are said to carry a person to higher levels of spiritual consciousness—or a soul up to paradise.</p>
<p>If any bird has broad enough shoulders to carry messages of hope across the land, surely it is the crane—in the flesh or in paper. It is said that a thousand folded cranes, one for each year of the bird’s life, makes a wish come true.</p>
<p>“Art can help us heal,” Lorri says. “There are many examples of how art has been used to help people recover from traumatic events in the past. The crane project—both paper and bronze—is the vehicle we can use to help people who are so desperately in need of healing right now as a town, community, and country.”</p>
<h3>The Team</h3>
<p>LORRI ACOTT</p>
<p>A teacher for 25 years in elementary, junior high, and high school, Lorri taught in both general and art classrooms. She also taught children with emotional<br/>and learning disabilities.</p>
<p>“When I taught in the elementary school, I remember all the wonderful things the first grade teachers did to help kids understand the concept of 100,” she said. “They collected things all year long—they laid out bottle caps, jelly beans, and pennies, one by one, so that a hundred could really be understood.”</p>
<p>As she folded practice cranes, in brightly colored origami squares, she asked, “What do a thousand prayers look like? What about ten thousand, or one hundred thousand, or a million? The only way we will know is by seeing them.”</p>

che, sotto la laccatura marrone, emergevano delle tracce di colore. Avvicinando
una lampada alla superficie della porta ha potuto constatare che quelle che
all’inizio erano solo tracce di colore in realtà componevano delle figure:

For this reason, your help is necessary in order to save precious works of art.About us“RestuarArti” is an association of volunteers who gathered to promote our artistic heritage and to increase its value.Basically, “RestaurArti” is searching for some contributions in money which will be assigned to the restorations of damaged art-pieces.Team members:Rossana LoiaconoLaura CorchiaRossana Loiacono is a restorer specialized in recovery and conservation of paintings collocated in the Southern areas of Apulia. Her professional training started out with studies in this sphere of art, in Arezzo, under Professor Carlo Guido. She managed mainly her activity in Apulia and Basilicata.She has been collaborated with Monuments and Fine Arts Office since 1980. She was engaged in other important activities as such as a collaboration with the Provincial Museum, in the city of Lecce.Laura Corchia, instead, got her Bachelor’s degree of Conservation of Cultural Assets with the final work “The restoration of canvas paintings through minimus means of interventions and typical techniques”. She had some important professional experiences at the University of Salento,Faculty of Cultural Heritage Conservation. Now, she is going on with her studies at the same Faculty.“RestaurArti” would this project to come true.The door where our painting is placed is located in one of the Churches of Gallipoli.Money lacks and this condition could definitely lead to the loss of this art-work.Although a strong support is necessary, local authorities are not able to make better the situation.As far as money is concerned we are searching for some contributions to know more about the history of the art-piece, as well. State of the paintingThe painting was accidentally discovered last year.While the Prior of the Confraternity was dragging a big jar full of water, he tripped up and broke it.The water fell on the ground sprinkling the door. So, the Prior tried to wipe it with a cloth when under the brown lacquer some traces of colours appeared. He examined them and he noticed that those lines of colours belonged to a more complex figure such as an angel or a Dominican Saint.The surface of the painting  is completely deteriorated and the lack of funds enables us to discover something more about its subject or its style. The work could be made by a local painter but, at the moment, a signature is impossibile to be discerned.We know that this art-piece was an oil painting on a wooden board and that it measures 2,10x1,03 m. It probably rises from the first half of the VIIth century.According to our suppositions, in a vague period, the work was used as a door to separate the presbytery from the sacristy. This kind of use worn it out.The Rosary Church belonged to the Dominican Order arrived in Gallipoli during the XVIth century.The followers of St. Dominicus, in fact, in devotion to him, founded the Church which became very important for the Confraternity of the Most Holy Rosary. Now, it is one of the most ancient churches in the city and it represents the Christian faith of tailors.Some precious ornaments of the altar and of the nave constitute the evidence of the collaboration at the building between Vespasiano Genuino and Gian Domenico Catalano.OUR CAMPAIGN“Crowdfounding’s campaign” aims to substain restoration through contribution of every single one of you .You can always follow our progresses on facebook: https://www.facebook.com/pages/RestaurArti/713354805354554or you can subscribe  to our mailing list: restaurartipr@gmail.comRestoring a work of art means to let other generations know their past, their history which has to be protected.HOW YOU CAN HELP USIf you can not contribute in money you can spread our message.We need more LIKESShare this message on facebook, twitter and other social networksLet us know your opinion through commentsTalk about our project to your friends, your family.

<p><strong>Some Background Info</strong></p>
<p>My name is Mandy Cano Villalobos and I'm an artist based in Grand Rapids, MI. I work in a variety of mediums, from drawing and textiles to performance and installation. All of my projects are related to time. How do we understand our unfolding lives through story-telling? How do we use rituals to make meaning in everyday routines? These are the kind of questions that drive my artistic practice.</p>
<p>This Summer I've been invited to attend Hambidge Residency. With your help, I can take advantage of this tremendous opportunity. As a mother of three young kids, it's hard to be a full time mom and a full time artist. Your contributions would allow me to focus on my art and help nurture my career.</p>
<p>While at Hambidge, I have lots of goals. I will continue my Sisyphus series for upcoming exhibitions at Lafontsee Galleries in Michigan. I'll also produce small paper works for a November show at James May Gallery in Algoma, WI. In addition to studio production, artist residencies are an excellent way to network with colleagues and explore collaborative possibilities.</p>
<p>Basically, I'm excited for this Summer! Please consider supporting me, at any amount, to give me the time and space to focus on my craft.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<p><strong>Getting there...</strong></p>
<p>The fee to attend Hambidge is $500, which is an amazing bargain. But I also need to cover travel costs, meals and supplies (with a detour to the grandparents to drop the kiddos off in Alabama). Below are some estimated costs:</p>
<p>$500 Lodging and Attendance Fees</p>
<p>$300  Travel                                  </p>
<p>$400   Food </p>
<p>$600   Materials</p>
<p>$200 Miscellaneous costs, including Indiegogo fees</p>
<p>That's a total of $2000.</p>
<p>Any little bit helps. Even $10 will cover the cost of a meal! And if I don't achieve my funding goals, your contributions will still help meet my needs. If I exceed my goals, I will invest that money into studio production costs so I can keep making art through the Summer and Fall. Either way, it's a good cause!</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Thank you!</strong></p>
<p>This whole artist thing is so rewarding. It also takes a lot of time, money, and perseverance. Recently I've come to realize that there are a lot of people who want to support the arts and who value what I and other artists do.  I am so grateful for everyone who has helped me over the years - not only through funding, but through free materials, watching my kids while I finish that painting, helping me in the studio, and just showing up to my exhibitions. </p>
<p>I can't do this alone, but a community of art advocates can. You are my community, and I am so grateful for your support.  Thank you!</p>
<p>For those of you who are able to donate to this trip, I'd like to give you a small gift in return. Handmade thank you cards, tea bag quilts and hand embellished prints are all available at different levels of donation. Each item is one of a kind, and it's my way of showing you my appreciation.</p>
<p>As I said, I feel called to this profession - it's how I contribute to our culture. But with opportunities come challenges. I have a lot of exhibitions this year, and I need funding and support to make art, frame it, ship it and travel to gallery openings. It all begins at Hambidge.</p>

<p>You might not able to contribute right now. That's okay! One way you can help is to get the word out! Share this campaign on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram or email. There are nifty little icons to the right of the pink ""Back It"" button that makes sharing super easy. </p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Wine has always been a big
part of my life, but growing up in Napa Valley I took it for granted. When Kyle
and I met in college, I happily tagged along as his interest in craft beer led
us to seek out unique wines. Seeing his love of wine develop reinvigorated a passion
that I thought was just a small part of me. Since we met six years ago, we’ve
loved entertaining and introducing friends to new wines, and rosé is always our
go-to. It’s light, versatile and complex, but doesn’t take itself too
seriously. To us, wine is about more than great quality and taste; it's about
sharing it with our friends and creating lasting memories together. No other
wine does this better than rosé. It’s our passion for rosé and creating these
experiences that made us realize we had to make Paper Planes, so we could share
this on a larger scale.</p><p><br/></p>
<p><b>Why Rosé? It’s Not An After Thought, It’s Our Only
Thought</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Two years ago, after drinking
our way through just about every California rosé there was, we started thinking
about why, despite how great it is, does rosé still seem to be an afterthought?
We thought, “Maybe winemakers aren’t really interested,” or “Maybe people still
have misconceptions about rosé.” In the end, it didn’t matter. All that did
matter is that for us, rosé isn’t an afterthought - it's our only thought.
We're proud to be the first winery in the Russian River Valley to make
exclusively rosé. With Paper Planes, we aren’t just setting out to make a
product that the growing number of rosé drinkers will love, but one that will
convert non-rosé drinkers everywhere.</p><p><br/></p>
<p><b>Great Wine and Great Company - What It’s All About</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">We are part of the next
generation of wine drinkers. We crave adventure and innovation in our wines,
and we revel in the simple moments around a communal table. Whether it’s a
backyard dinner party, a spontaneous cocktail hour, or an afternoon picnic in
the park, Paper Planes is the perfect complement to easy-going enjoyment, and
we hope that it will inspire spirited connections in simple moments.</p><p><br/></p>
<p><b>Our Progress - We’re Harvesting!</b></p>

our fruit from winegrowers who we’ve known for years. We’ve also found the
facility where we’re going to make the wine, formed our LLC &amp; trademark,
created our label and website, and ordered all the materials like glass, corks

</p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">Thames: Dark River, Still Shining
is a photography project documenting people and communities living along the course of the River Thames from the source to the sea, examining their
connections to the river and surrounding landscape. The resulting photographs
will form a touring exhibition in the last 2 weeks of August 2014 stopping at 8
locations along the river from Oxford to Walton-on-Thames and ending in London
where the images will be exhibited during September in conjunction with 'Totally Thames'. I have arranged all the touring and exhibition details
but I need your help to cover printing, material and transportation costs and
to help with the production of a limited edition book, please help me to make
my dream a reality! </p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">
</p><p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">The project has been over two and
half years in the making; it started because of my interest in ‘the
photographic journey’ and how this can be used as a method to explore
relationships between people and their surroundings.  The idea for this project came from my desire
to undertake a photographic trip with a preformed route, which could give
the project a focused narrative. My grandparents lived by the Thames for 40
years, so I felt the urge to explore an area that has a personal significance
and that also covers many regions previously unknown to me; which are connected
by a unifying force. I began by walking sections of the Thames path, exploring
the different areas and photographing the people I met along the way. Through
each meeting I began to understand more about the way the river interconnects
with peoples lives and the spirituality felt by having a deep connection to the
Thames.</span><br/></p>

<br/><p></p></div>","Thames: Dark River, Still Shining
is a photography project documenting people and communities living along the course of the River Thames from the source to the sea, examining their
connections to the river and surrounding landscape. The resulting photographs
will form a touring exhibition in the last 2 weeks of August 2014 stopping at 8
locations along the river from Oxford to Walton-on-Thames and ending in London
where the images will be exhibited during September in conjunction with 'Totally Thames'. I have arranged all the touring and exhibition details
but I need your help to cover printing, material and transportation costs and
to help with the production of a limited edition book, please help me to make
my dream a reality! 
The project has been over two and
half years in the making; it started because of my interest in ‘the
photographic journey’ and how this can be used as a method to explore
relationships between people and their surroundings.  The idea for this project came from my desire
to undertake a photographic trip with a preformed route, which could give
the project a focused narrative. My grandparents lived by the Thames for 40
years, so I felt the urge to explore an area that has a personal significance
and that also covers many regions previously unknown to me; which are connected
by a unifying force. I began by walking sections of the Thames path, exploring
the different areas and photographing the people I met along the way. Through
each meeting I began to understand more about the way the river interconnects
with peoples lives and the spirituality felt by having a deep connection to the
Thames.
The
longest river entirely in England; The Thames is steeped in tradition and culture, described by some as being 'Liquid History' it is an
inspiration to artists and musicians, a river of leisure, of sport and a place
people call home. Having now covered the entire route of the river I want
to bring my photographs to as wide an audience as possible and you can help me do this by supporting the project!
What I Need & What You Get
My goal is to exhibit the
photographs at 8 locations along the river and at the Embassy Tea Gallery in
the Bankside area of London, near Tate Modern, and to produce a photobook to
accompany the exhibition. I have arranged a mixture of venues including
riverside pubs, arts centers and Environment Agency locks. By exhibiting in a
variety of venues, many of them next to the river itself, I hope to enhance the
artistic experience for audiences and bring the images to life by placing them within the areas where the pictures where taken. I also really like the idea of exhibiting in the open air or in place not normally associated with exhibitions as this allows different types of audiences to become engaged with the work.
I need
to build 4 freestanding exhibition boards on which I will display the images
at the touring locations.  The pictures will be shown at each venue for one night
only, so I need to be flexible and the boards will provide a
pre-prepared space on which to show the images.
The
photographs will be printed and mounted on aluminum for durability as they will be
transported and re-hung a number of times and I will also need to hire a large
van to transport everything needed for these exhibitions. Your donations will cover the cost of making and printing a limited edition photo book, as well as marketing and promotional costs. Every pound donated
will bring me one step closer to being able to show my project to an audience
and the more I can raise the better the exhibition experience will be for
everyone, thank you so much for your support! 
In return for your kind support I am offering a number of perks or gifts, including a set of 4x 6x6 inch postcards, 4 different sizes of prints, 2 of which will be framed  (you can choose your favourite image from the exhibition)  and of course the photobook! All perks come with a personal thank you note

For those of you who are not familiar with what Art Basel is, it is a 4-day event where over 250 of the world's leading galleries show the work of masters of art to newly emerging artists like myself with over 50,000 people including artists, collectors, enthusiasts, and curators in attendance. For more details/information on Art Basel you can visit their website: <a href=""https://www.artbasel.com/en/Miami-Beach"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Art Basel Miami Beach</a>.  For the past few months I have been working up to participate in this great event, stepping out of my boundaries and doing a series consisting of color photographs (I mostly work with black and white film). The photography that I will be displaying in Art Basel pertains to color psychology, how color affects us and what emotions we draw from seeing certain colors. If you are not familiar with my work and would like to see my photography, visit <a href=""http://oliviaperezphotography.tumblr.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Olivia Perez Photography</a>. </span></p><h3>How you can help!</h3><p>Although the gallery has expressed that they really like my photographs and want to showcase my work, in order for it to be displayed I must rent out the space for the month of December which is where I could use your help! The costs for processing film, printing, and framing alone have been and are very draining financially, and the cost of renting the space for the month is over $1200. Anything you can contribute would help me out exponentially, $1, $2, seriously anything you can afford or would like to contribute to help making my dreams come true! I know a lot of people are tight on money so even if you can't contribute anything, pass the word along and share this campaign with others :) **you can use the indiegogo share tools to promote on facebook and other websites</p><h3>How to claim your perk</h3><p>If you donate $25 or more, email oliviasartbaselfundraiser@gmail.com with your name, mailing address, and what picture you would like to receive. All pictures will be sent out once my campaign time limit is up (December 2) and if my goal is reached before that date then they will be sent out earlier :)<br/></p><h3>What you would be helping me accomplish?</h3><p>For the many years that I have been passionate about doing photography, these past 2 years have really been the first time I've been more open and motivated with my photographs; I've been sharing my work in art shows or online and have been constantly creating, becoming more comfortable with exposing what I do to the world, or at least anyone who is willing to enjoy them and relate. Getting the exposure which Art Basel provides with it's over 50,000 attendees is more than I could have ever imagined or hoped for. By donating money you will be helping me to share my art, myself, with not only people in Miami, or Florida, or even the U.S. but people from all over the world and I can feel nothing but the highest gratitude and appreciation for those who do and even those who share.

The photography that I will be displaying in Art Basel pertains to color psychology, how color affects us and what emotions we draw from seeing certain colors. If you are not familiar with my work and would like to see my photography, visit Olivia Perez Photography. How you can help!Although the gallery has expressed that they really like my photographs and want to showcase my work, in order for it to be displayed I must rent out the space for the month of December which is where I could use your help! The costs for processing film, printing, and framing alone have been and are very draining financially, and the cost of renting the space for the month is over $1200. Anything you can contribute would help me out exponentially, $1, $2, seriously anything you can afford or would like to contribute to help making my dreams come true! I know a lot of people are tight on money so even if you can't contribute anything, pass the word along and share this campaign with others :) **you can use the indiegogo share tools to promote on facebook and other websitesHow to claim your perkIf you donate $25 or more, email oliviasartbaselfundraiser@gmail.com with your name, mailing address, and what picture you would like to receive. All pictures will be sent out once my campaign time limit is up (December 2) and if my goal is reached before that date then they will be sent out earlier :)What you would be helping me accomplish?For the many years that I have been passionate about doing photography, these past 2 years have really been the first time I've been more open and motivated with my photographs; I've been sharing my work in art shows or online and have been constantly creating, becoming more comfortable with exposing what I do to the world, or at least anyone who is willing to enjoy them and relate. Getting the exposure which Art Basel provides with it's over 50,000 attendees is more than I could have ever imagined or hoped for. By donating money you will be helping me to share my art, myself, with not only people in Miami, or Florida, or even the U.S. but people from all over the world and I can feel nothing but the highest gratitude and appreciation for those who do and even those who share. Thank you!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

#TRIPTYCH is an exhibition of three hilarious and haunting portraits of society and psyche: Phenomena & Existences by Daniil Kharms, SPIDERS ARE REAL! THEY'RE ALIVE AND THEY HATE YOU!! by T. Adamson, and Le Mort de Tintagiles by
 Maurice Maeterlinck. These three shorts are being staged by a gathering
 of radical performers, designers, and writers who together desire to 
reinvigorate the spirit of the old-avant-garde within a visual, 
visceral, and ecstatic production bursting with the vulgar vitality of 
artistic rebellion. 
Three centuries, three nations, and three billion spiders collide in a
 triptych of three underperformed plays which will be imagined 
and re-imagined this August 20-23rd @HERE 145 6th Ave. as a part of SubletSeries@HERE: Co-op, HERE's curated summer rental program, which provides artists with subsidized space and equipment, as well as technical support.

What is Le Mort De Tintagiles?

Le Mort de Tintagiles by Maurice Maeterlinck. The Belgian Nobel-laureate’s eerie and devastating allegory of fate, fear, and death. Performed with a new American re-translation by T. Adamson, the play enchantingly orchestrates the  powerlessness, futility and beauty that inspired Maeterlinck's Static Drama.  Within the sickness of the castle, Tintagiles will die. 






The Competition:3 plays. 3 campaigns. 1 show. 



While all three #Triptych plays will be presented as a single show with a shared company, each play largely functions as its own production with its own featured actors and singular production needs. SO In the spirit of friendly competition, each play will fund-raise separately to try to reach their individual goal of $500 before the other two productions.
So donate to your favorite show! Donate to your friend's show! Donate to the shows that your enemy isn't in! Donate to all three! The possibilities are endless, and all donations go towards making a night of innovative theater a reality.

My name is Naomi Romero and I am illustrator and corgi enthusiast. I am lucky enough to work from home as a freelance children's illustrator for the Bright Agency, as well as working on cool projects from BOOM! Studios and even character design for an upcoming movie that will hit theaters soon! I have started selling at conventions last year in order to get myself out there and meet wonderful people. People often ask me if I would ever make a plush based off of my work. The thought has always been in my mind and I wanted to bring this dream to life. I am a crazy corgi enthusiast, having one of my very own! Artists usually know me as a corgi artist and I couldn't think of anything better than to create a corgi plush based off of my style!The plush is based off the following illustration!Kiernan Sjursen-Lien helped me plushify my illustration in an easy to read turn around!

<p><strong>~Walter Benjamin<br/></strong></p>
<p>Hi there, my name is <strong>Dorian Batycka</strong> and I am an artist and curator based in Hamilton, ON, Canada. My background involves attempting to challenge the boundaries of curatorial practice through nontraditional approaches to exhibition making, seeking to blur traditional distinctions between artist/curator/audience/artwork.</p>
<p>I have been active as a curator since 2009 and have curated numerous exhibitions in addition to developing various forms of artistic research pertaining to curatorial practice and theory.  In June 2011, I developed a curatorial method that sought to combine traditional scholarly approaches to understanding the history and origins of the <strong>Venice Biennale,</strong> with a series of actions, interventions and performances. This culminated in a DJ set at the Osloo Floating Bar (part of the Danish Pavilion), in which I used archival sound clips taken from the Historical Archives in the Giardini, in addition to a spoken-word manifesto from the guerilla-artist collective the Anonymous Stateless Immigrants, combining the two together with rhythmic drum loops, sounds and samples, in the process curating an environment of overlapping texts, art histories and experimental sounds.</p>
<p>Since then, I have been active in a variety of different contexts. In September 2011, I co-founded an artist-run project space called<strong> Temporary Projects</strong> located in the diverse James North neighborhood downtown Hamilton.  Recently, I have also been invited to develop a project at<strong> La Chambre Blanche</strong> in Quebec City for an international symposium and exhibition on Network Art, which is scheduled to open October 30th 2012. My work has also been published in a variety of internationally syndicated journals and magazines including <strong>Art &amp; Education</strong>,<strong> ArtLeaks</strong>, and <strong>Lump</strong>.</p>
<p>The opportunity to attend the <strong>9<sup>th</sup> Shanghai Biennale</strong> as part of the <strong>“Academy for Reciprocal Enlightenment”</strong> is an even more recent development in my artistic life and work. The “Academy” consists of a series of workshops exploring new typologies of curatorial practice, organized by <strong>Qiu Zhijie, Jens Hoffman, Boris Groys and Johnson Chang</strong>. The “Academy” will culminate in the development of an exhibition proposal for the 10<sup>th</sup> Shanghai Biennale in 2014. An exciting opportunity for me indeed!</p>
<p> The website of the Shanghai Biennale (<a href=""http://2012.shanghaibiennale.org/en/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://2012.shanghaibiennale.org/en/</a>) describes the program as:</p>
<p><em>“The Academy refers to a Platonic-style community of wisdom and criticism.”</em></p>
<p><em>“It embodies our educational philosophy: education is a self governing action by learner communities, which serve as a platform of exchanges and dissemination of opinions”</em></p>
<p><em>“The Shanghai Biennale 2012 will occur under the theme Reactivation, interpreting among other aspects the social mobilization and structure of community, as well as the critical role of education.”</em></p>
<p>Although the Shanghai Biennale is graciously covering the cost of the program and my accommodations throughout my stay in Shanghai, I am responsible for round-trip airfare to and from Shanghai, visa fee and living expenses (meal and local car fare), as well as the cost of materials to develop any new projects/art works while I am there.</p>
<p><strong>In order to participate in the 9<sup>th</sup> Shanghai Biennale, I will therefore need to raise enough money to cover the cost of my flight to Shanghai and back, along with associated Visa costs. The remaining expenses including meal and local travel costs along with costs associated with the realization of new art works I will incur myself.</strong></p>
<p><strong>In total, I am hoping to raise $1,500-$2,000 CDN enough to (hopefully) cover the following:</strong></p>
<p><strong>$1,200-$1,800 – round trip airfare (Toronto/Shanghai)</strong></p>
<p><strong>$100-200 – Chinese VISA fee (conditional upon how quickly I need it processed)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Please kindly consider supporting this endeavor through whatever financial contribution you are comfortable with. To make things a little more interesting, there are also some perks/giveaways I will be making to those who are able to make a contribution.</strong></p>

Although the Shanghai Biennale is graciously covering the cost of the program and my accommodations throughout my stay in Shanghai, I am responsible for round-trip airfare to and from Shanghai, visa fee and living expenses (meal and local car fare), as well as the cost of materials to develop any new projects/art works while I am there.
In order to participate in the 9th Shanghai Biennale, I will therefore need to raise enough money to cover the cost of my flight to Shanghai and back, along with associated Visa costs. The remaining expenses including meal and local travel costs along with costs associated with the realization of new art works I will incur myself.
In total, I am hoping to raise $1,500-$2,000 CDN enough to (hopefully) cover the following:
$1,200-$1,800 – round trip airfare (Toronto/Shanghai)
$100-200 – Chinese VISA fee (conditional upon how quickly I need it processed)
Please kindly consider supporting this endeavor through whatever financial contribution you are comfortable with. To make things a little more interesting, there are also some perks/giveaways I will be making to those who are able to make a contribution.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>What is Scrap?</h3>
<p>Scrap is a student-funded, student-organized art magazine comprised of student artwork and literature. It's an inclusive space for students to display their art and recieve recognition for their talents. All of us on the Scrap team are higly motivated and dedicated. We aspire to take Scrap to a city-wide level by increasing our scope for submissions and expanding our audience.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>How are we going to achieve that, you ask?</h3>
<p>We intend to print as many copies of our magazine as our funds will allow. To give you a rough idea of how many copies we need, 100 copies are $450, 200 copies are $840 and 300 copies are $1,200. We hope to print up to 300 copies, and begin to gather a base of submitting student artists at high schools all across the city by sending student representatives and sample copies to other schools.</p>
<p>Complete Budget Breakdown:</p>
<p>$1500 - indiegogo fees ($105) = $1,395</p>
<p>$1,395 - printing fees ($1,200) = $195</p>
<p>$195 - price of paper ($40) = $155</p>
<p>The excess $155 will be used either towards some sort of Scrap-related event (a gallery-type event, perhaps?), or towards printing even MORE copies. </p>
<h3>But who cares? What is the purpose of Scrap?</h3>
</div>
<div>
<p>As I said before, Scrap is a open medium for students to submit their artwork, in all senses of the word. It will hopefully eventually be a publication that not only inspires our student following, but the the public as well.</p>
<h3>Now I care. How can I help?</h3>
<p>Well, you can give us your money. But if you can't donate, for whatever reason, forward the page to others. You can also send us an email or leave comments on our website, whether they're comments of encouragment or disgust, we appreciate your interest.</p>

<h3>Crowdfunded Art!</h3>
<p>By contributing to a literary prize, you are helping a young writer create their art!</p>
<p>The #AppropriationPrize events highlighted two things: the lack of diversity in the ranks of senior Canadian editors and journalists, but also the democratizing power of social media. A crowdfunded literary prize won't just support new literary voices and nurture emerging indigenous writers, but is also the ultimate boon to young writers -- and to all of you who contribute<strong>. </strong>The more money we can raise, the better because it means we have more to give to emerging artists. But <u><strong>how many</strong></u> people give is also important.  Imagine knowing, as a writer just starting out, that your work is being supported by 1000 people. Our contributions, all together, are worth so much more than one big donation. Together we are a chorus of positive change, creating and building.</p>
</div><div>
<p>Point being:<strong> NO DONATION IS TOO SMALL!</strong> Remember the story of the hummingbird and the forest fire? Little hummingbird flew back and forth, sprinkling tiny droplets on the raging fire, while the other animals stood by and watched in wonder. ""What are you doing Nenookaasi?"" they asked her. ""Surely you will perish and you cannot stop this fire?"" </p>
<p>""I am doing what I can,"" she replied.</p>
<p>(Why not check out Michael Nicoll Yahgulanaas' beautiful book that includes this tale: <u>Flight of the Hummingbird</u> by Greystone Books? Learn more about his art here:  <a href=""http://mny.ca/en/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://mny.ca/en/)</a></p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Indigenous Voices Matter</h3>
<p>Seems obvious, doesn’t it? The more perspectives we can see/hear/read the richer our imagination, intellect and spirit.  Cherokee Nation academic and author Daniel Heath Justice offers seven reasons on his blog, <u>Imagine Otherwise</u>, why Indigenous literature matters:</p>
<ol>
<li value=""NaN"">It can give <strong>perspective</strong> on the diversity and complexity of the Indigenous community, revealing one dimensional stereotypes about Indigenous people for what they are;</li>
<li value=""NaN"">It can be <strong>beautiful</strong>, showcasing the “full, rich depths of Indigenous humanity and creative spirit.” Beauty is a positive and healthy thing to experience and be changed by;</li>
<li value=""NaN"">It can <strong>empower</strong> by reflecting back an image of community that is affirming of humanity, dignity and strength;</li>
<li value=""NaN"">Reading nuanced stories of human experience builds <strong>empathy</strong>, which we so desperately need to nurture and build in the non-Indigenous community at this moment in our history;</li>
<li value=""NaN"">It leaves a <strong>legacy</strong> of stories for future generations;</li>
<li value=""NaN"">Writing, reading, discussing, considering Indigenous literature firms up <strong>continuity </strong>of Indigenous culture. “The People go on, and so do the stories.”</li>
<li value=""NaN"">Creative expression in all forms is transformative, and offers hope and <strong>possibility</strong> for a wholesome abiding in the world by the artist and their community.</li>
</ol>
<p>Daniel Heath Justice, Chair of the First Nations and Indigenous Studies Program at UBC, has a forthcoming book, <u>Why Indigenous Literatures Matter</u> (Wilfred Laurier U Press). In the meantime you can read his blog post on this subject, which I have tried to summarize, here: <a href=""http://imagineotherwise.ca/scholarship.php?Blog-Posts-6"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://imagineotherwise.ca/scholarship.php?Blog-Posts-6</a></p>

By contributing to a literary prize, you are helping a young writer create their art!
The #AppropriationPrize events highlighted two things: the lack of diversity in the ranks of senior Canadian editors and journalists, but also the democratizing power of social media. A crowdfunded literary prize won't just support new literary voices and nurture emerging indigenous writers, but is also the ultimate boon to young writers -- and to all of you who contribute. The more money we can raise, the better because it means we have more to give to emerging artists. But how many people give is also important.  Imagine knowing, as a writer just starting out, that your work is being supported by 1000 people. Our contributions, all together, are worth so much more than one big donation. Together we are a chorus of positive change, creating and building.

Point being: NO DONATION IS TOO SMALL! Remember the story of the hummingbird and the forest fire? Little hummingbird flew back and forth, sprinkling tiny droplets on the raging fire, while the other animals stood by and watched in wonder. ""What are you doing Nenookaasi?"" they asked her. ""Surely you will perish and you cannot stop this fire?"" 
""I am doing what I can,"" she replied.

Indigenous Voices Matter
Seems obvious, doesn’t it? The more perspectives we can see/hear/read the richer our imagination, intellect and spirit.  Cherokee Nation academic and author Daniel Heath Justice offers seven reasons on his blog, Imagine Otherwise, why Indigenous literature matters:

It can give perspective on the diversity and complexity of the Indigenous community, revealing one dimensional stereotypes about Indigenous people for what they are;
It can be beautiful, showcasing the “full, rich depths of Indigenous humanity and creative spirit.” Beauty is a positive and healthy thing to experience and be changed by;
It can empower by reflecting back an image of community that is affirming of humanity, dignity and strength;
Reading nuanced stories of human experience builds empathy, which we so desperately need to nurture and build in the non-Indigenous community at this moment in our history;
It leaves a legacy of stories for future generations;
Writing, reading, discussing, considering Indigenous literature firms up continuity of Indigenous culture. “The People go on, and so do the stories.”
Creative expression in all forms is transformative, and offers hope and possibility for a wholesome abiding in the world by the artist and their community.

Daniel Heath Justice, Chair of the First Nations and Indigenous Studies Program at UBC, has a forthcoming book, Why Indigenous Literatures Matter (Wilfred Laurier U Press). In the meantime you can read his blog post on this subject, which I have tried to summarize, here: http://imagineotherwise.ca/scholarship.php?Blog-Posts-6
 
Where Should I Start?
Don’t know where to begin? Here’s a great piece by scholar Alicia Elliott, Ten Indigenous Writers You Need to Read Right Now:
https://www.vice.com/en_ca/article/ten-indigenous-writers-you-need-to-read-right-now.
CBC has a more daunting list of 108, recommended by listeners:
http://www.cbc.ca/books/2017/05/60-books-by-indigenous-writers-to-read-as-recommended-by-you.html. Pour yourself a cup of tea and savour losing yourself in these lists…

Logistics
It's a delight to announce that we will partner with the Indigenous Literary Studies Association (ILSA) to administer the award. ILSA is a national organization of scholars, knowledge-keepers, artists, and community members. Their guiding purpose is to honour the history and promote the ongoing production of Indigenous literatures in all forms.  We will announce more details about the award on Saturday May 27, 2017 at Ashineu Aimun: An Indigenous Poetry Night  at the Imperial Pub, 54 Dundas St. E., Toronto, 8:00 p.m.

<p><b>Where is Bronzeville? </b></p>
<p>Bronzeville is an area of the 
South Side of Chicago. It became the American center for African 
American Art, business, entertainment and culture in general. 
 Bronzeville was the end destination of  the 20th Century Great 
Migration of African Americans from rural Southern states to cities in 
the North. African American Legends such as musicians Louis Armstrong, 
Muddy Waters, Sam Cooke, Nat King Cole, Mahailia Jackson, boxers Joe 
Louis, Jack Johnson writers Lorraine Hansberry, Richard Wright and the 
activist Ida B. Wells called Bronzeville home. </p>
<p>100% OF THE 
PROCEEDS OF THIS FUND RAISING EFFORT WILL DIRECTLY BENEFIT THE PEOPLE OF
 BRONZEVILLE. THE MONEY RAISED IN THIS CAMPAIGN WILL BE MATCHED BY LOCAL
 POLITICIANS AND WILL PAY FOR SEVERAL PHOTO MURALS THAT WILL RE-CONNECT 
BRONZEVILLE TO ITS HISTORY, <b>THE FIRST PHOTO MURAL OF NAT KING COLE IS UP ON THE SOUTHEAST CORNER OF 43RD AND KING DRIVE,</b> FACING NORTH.  <b>A SECOND MURAL, OF LOUIS ARMSTRONG SITS AT 39TH AND KING DRIVE. WE NEED YOUR PLEDGE ASAP</b> <b>TO erect a large (20' x 27') photo mural of writer and Bronzeville Legend Lorraine Hansberry.  </b>Make<b> </b>a year-end donation to Bronzeville Legends and invest in our efforts to create community. <br/></p>
<p><b>What is the Bronzeville Legends Identity Initiative?</b></p>
<p>The
 three pillars of vibrant community development are Identity, 
Sustainability and Mobility.  Identity represents a community’s historic
 and present day character. When we think of China town, we know exactly
 what we are getting, quality restaurants and an authentic experience of
 Chinese culture. When we think of  Devon Avenue, we know it as place to
 experience Indian culture.</p>
<p> Bronzeville is sitting on a gold mine, it’s rich history and famous 
past residents.

Musician Louis Armstrong performed at clubs like the Savoy Ballroom 
(4733 S. King Drive), the Royal Gardens (459 E. 31st Street), and lived 
on 44th street.  Author Richard Wright wrote his first book here.  
Heavyweight boxers Joe Louis and Jack Johnson called Bronzeville home as
 did Muddy Waters, Sam Cooke and many other African American legends.

<br/></p>
<p></p>
<h3>The Impact</h3> The Bronzeville Legends Identity Initiative is a creative placemaking 
campaign that uses large scale commercial quality public art 
installations to create a backdrop, an ambiance within which the 
community’s commercial and cultural activities can take place and which 
acts as a magnet for tourism and a catalyst for healthy outdoor 
activities like biking and walking.  <b>When you attend a museum exhibit
 you are encouraged to “exit through the gift shop” and leave some of 
your money behind.  The idea is to transform Bronzeville into an outdoor
 museum that attracts visitors and to make its commercial corridors the 
gift shop.</b> This increases  retail sales per square foot and 
offer chances to sell Bronzeville as a cultural and entertainment 
destination, leading to jobs.  An investment in high impact, coordinated
 Public Art that conveys a single message of Black excellence that
compliments all of the cultural activities that go on in Bronzeville and supports the new Artist galleries and work spaces, attracting those
 members of the ""creative class"" so important to the revival of any 
community. The works turn the neighborhood's vacant lots into a positive
 attribute because the open spaces create viewing opportunities.  The 
photo murals ""activate' the space around them and support the many 
gardens springing up in the neighborhood.<br/>
<p></p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p></p>
<p><b>Violence is a quest for Identity.</b></p>
<p>The violent young man 
seeks to learn about himself by clashing with others.  Belonging to a 
gang gives the young man an Identity; membership makes him a somebody. 
At this crucial time, not only is not enough being done to give these 
young men something to hold on to, public schools are being closed and 
the County jail is over-flowing. When a kid looks back in his past, 
there is nothing there to give him hope,no values but materialism. To 
free them from the cycle we must provide them with a substitute 
Identity, one that will enhance their self-esteem. These Art works
partly replace that combative Identity with a new, healthier one by 
reconnecting our youth to a time when we were great. <b>The Initiative improves pride in the neighborhood and teachrd the area's children 
about the values of black excellence, entrepreneurship and perseverance 
that enabled these neighborhood legends to achieve what they did.</b>This helps address the neighborhood's current problems and improve safety perception.  <b>For all of this to succeed, the support of the entire community and indeed, the diaspora is needed. </b></p>This IndieGoGo campaign is a way for everyone to show their respect 
for the culture and to say, ""We know where we’ve been and so now know 
exactly where we are going.""  This campaign is not an attempt to live in
 the past, but rather a retracing of our steps back to that fork in the 
road where we got lost, so that we may start off in the right direction.
 Show your support today by making a pledge.  <b>Your donation will help erect a large (20' x 27') photo mural of Bronzeville Legend Lorraine Hansberry, who wrote ""Raisin In the Sun"",</b>  to be installed Spring, 2015 on the top wall of the Cain Barber College at 365 East 51st Street. Banners will be made and installed in 
the windows of local businesses. By reminding us of our past, the scale 
and power of these artworks get us excited about our future. <b>Pledge today.<br/></b>
</div><div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p> </p>
<p>Every project worth doing carries a certain amount of risk. 
However, the main risk with the Bronzeville Legends Initiative is not doing it. <b>A community that has lost its collective memory ceases to function as a cohesive unit.</b> Design
 standards that emphasize and preserve Bronzeville's unique Identity 
have been established and communicated to corporate entities who wish to 
do business in the community.  These standards will prevent large 
businesses from putting up bland, ""cookie cutter"" facades that are 
inconsistent with Bronzeville's image and requires them to make a 
contribution to the neighborhood's Identity.  Media companies that own 
billboards throughout Bronzeville are being asked to donate ad space for 
photo murals that sell the idea of community, not just product.  The 
Initiative seeks to get various community players working 
together from a common artistic stylebook in an effort to create a 
Bronzeville Renaissance.<br/></p>

<h3>Who is The Meeting Point?</h3>

I will also have to cover food and transportation costs in Nicosia.  The Build Peace conference can supply me with some funding to cover material costs and is going to try to set me up with housing among the local art community.  If I have some extra room in my budget I would like to add more details to the installation such as cushions for people to sit on.  I would also love to explore bringing this installation to other conferences and events, so any remaining funding would go towards further developing and expanding this project for future occasions.</p>

<div>I am excited and honored to have this opportunity to bring my art work to an international event.  I am determined to make this project happen whether or not I meet my fundraising goals in this campaign and I am looking into other forms of fundraising.  I am passionate about the idea of creating intentional and interactive space to foster community even on the transient level of a conference.  Being able to take this project to Cyprus and then continue to develop it beyond the <i>Together Separate</i> show would be incredible!  Even if you are not able to contribute financially, thank you for taking the time to listen to my ideas and please share this project with others! </div>
