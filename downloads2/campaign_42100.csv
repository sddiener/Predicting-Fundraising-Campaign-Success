<p>Hi, we are the team behind Simmone Standing
The Label and we have had the immense pleasure of being invited to showcase our
Spring /Summer 2016 Collection on the Fashion Palette New York runway in
September.</p>
<p>This is an amazing opportunity not only for
the head designer Simmone, but also her team of enthusiastic volunteers who get
to be involved in the ‘behind the scenes’ view of a runway show and gain
knowledge in developing a story around a collection. </p>
<p>Contributing to this campaign means that parallel
to assisting the head designer Simmone showcase her designs on an international
platform, you will also be encouraging other young aspiring designers who come to
Simmone for mentorship to see that there is always opportunity and a means to
follow their dreams!  No ambition
is too big or out of reach if you have the passion to make it happen!<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> </span></p>

<p><i></i></p>
<p><i>“Something
Starting Right Now”</i> Spring Summer collection sought
to create a range of garments that are adventurous in the wearing, that tickle
the inner girl of the most sophisticated woman and inspire new dimensions of
wearing statement pieces. </p>
<p>This is to be Simmone Standing The Label’s
second collection and like the previous collection has a unique story all of
its own. Thinking ocean shapes mixed with crisp detailing and decisive cuts
head designer Simmone has let the whimsy of Disney’s “The Little Mermaid” and
the sheer sophistication of Katherine Hepburn amalgamate into her inspiration;
androgyny with seashells…</p>
<p>This campaign will release sneak peak
shoots showing minor detail, colours and shapes to keep you excited with
anticipation but will predominantly be kept secret until it hits the runway in
New York shhh… </p>

<p>Designed and produced solely in Adelaide Australia
Simmone Standing The Label is a new clothing line that launched in late 2014 in
conjunction with winning the Adelaide Fashion Festival Emerging Designer Award.
</p>
<p>It is very important to the head designer
that each piece is unique and makes a statement all of its own, she likes them
to be thought provoking and inspire the woman that wears it to stand out from
the crowd. </p>
<p><i>“She
is the kind of person who loves current trends but doesn’t compromise her own
flair and direction by following clique fashion ideals” </i></p>

<p>Simmone Standing, head designer and founder
of Simmone Standing The Label decided early in 2014 to utilise her 20 years of
fashion “affliction” and garment development knowledge to launch this brand
with a fresh direction and innovative ideas and the desire of inspiring young
creative individuals. </p>
<p>After making the logical decision to launch
this new brand, Simmone was encouraged to enter the Adelaide Fashion Festival’s
Emerging Designer award; where upon winning she established recognition for her
idiosyncrasy, refined cut and innovation. </p>
<p>Utilising the knowledge gained in the
development of the brand Simmone has become driven by the purpose of building a
business that offers support as well as creating exposure and opportunity for
aspiring young designers and creatively minded individuals; a business that
shares resources and provides business experience.</p>
<p>Looking into the future for the brand, Simmone and her team's prominent goal is to branch out and stock Simmone Standing The Label in high end boutiques around Australia and internationally.  </p>

second collection and like the previous collection has a unique story all of
its own. Thinking ocean shapes mixed with crisp detailing and decisive cuts

the sheer sophistication of Katherine Hepburn amalgamate into her inspiration;
androgyny with seashells…

Designed and produced solely in Adelaide Australia
Simmone Standing The Label is a new clothing line that launched in late 2014 in
conjunction with winning the Adelaide Fashion Festival Emerging Designer Award.

It is very important to the head designer
that each piece is unique and makes a statement all of its own, she likes them
to be thought provoking and inspire the woman that wears it to stand out from
the crowd. 
“She
is the kind of person who loves current trends but doesn’t compromise her own
flair and direction by following clique fashion ideals” 






Simmone Standing, head designer and founder
of Simmone Standing The Label decided early in 2014 to utilise her 20 years of
fashion “affliction” and garment development knowledge to launch this brand
with a fresh direction and innovative ideas and the desire of inspiring young
creative individuals. 
After making the logical decision to launch
this new brand, Simmone was encouraged to enter the Adelaide Fashion Festival’s
Emerging Designer award; where upon winning she established recognition for her
idiosyncrasy, refined cut and innovation. 
Utilising the knowledge gained in the
development of the brand Simmone has become driven by the purpose of building a
business that offers support as well as creating exposure and opportunity for
aspiring young designers and creatively minded individuals; a business that
shares resources and provides business experience.
Looking into the future for the brand, Simmone and her team's prominent goal is to branch out and stock Simmone Standing The Label in high end boutiques around Australia and internationally.

We want you to have the HYDRO-TRAILER available as soon as possible. The plan is aggressive but we are confident in our exceptional vendors that it is achievable. Here is the projected timeline for getting the HYDRO-TRAILER available and on the water.August/September 2015:  Get tons of new Indiegogo supporters, launch website and spread the word.October 2015: Safety and quality assurance testing. Finalize the engineering and place the first production order and procurement of raw materials and components.November 2015: Finalize the assembly, and packaging,December 2015: Begin fulfillment to our Indiegogo fans, spectators, riders, pro-riders and champions.January 2016: Introduce HYDRO-TRAILER at Toronto International Boat Show. Launch online sales platform.Refinements: As the HYDRO-TRAILER goes into production, there will likely be some minor adjustments to improve the final product. Pre-production prototypes will be made for safety certification and testing and allow us to incorporate any adjustments suggested by our experienced partners to ensure you and your HYDRO-TRAILER remain safe on the water.Fulfillment:  Sometimes things go not as planned such as a supplier misses a deadline, a machine breaks down, or a shipment gets lost. Those things could cause a delay. To minimize the possibility of manufacturing setbacks we will enter the manufacturing stage with at least one back-up supplier for each component.We will be working with manufacturers who have years of experience delivering excellent products in tremendous quantities. There will no doubt be some surprises along the road, but any obstacle will be addressed by combining our internal knowledge with external expertise, and an overall goal of making the best possible product for you, our supporters and customers.We can't wait to see you on the water and to say thank you for your support here on Indiegogo.

<p>We are Lips the Magazine, we being Hanna Scott Corrie, Hannah Huffman, and Cristina Boatman. This all started last summer when Hanna and Hannah met while working at the Standard Grill in the meatpacking district. Hanna a freelancing stylist and Hannah finishing up her BFA in photography at SVA, not sure what to do next with their lives. One thing remained constant sex, and fashion. Talking about it,  looking at it. Whats good sex, whats bad sex? Then feminism, and then sexuality in general.</p>
<p> We're not sure who came up with the idea of a magazine but we knew that we wanted to start a project together. Hanna knew Cristina from Takamichi Hair, where  Hanna worked as a receptionist for two years. Cristina originally started out as just one of our hair dressers, and then quickly becoming our managing editor. </p>
<p></p>
<h3>Elaborate you say?</h3>
<p>Lips the Magazine is a commentary on the boundaries between sex and fashion. Where does one end and the other begin? Rather than ignoring the subject of sex in fashion, and fashion in sex, we represent a platform outside binary lines. We find ourselves amidst a sexual revolution where even the broadest subcultures of sexuality are being recognized and accepted. Lips the Magazine is produced in collaboration with emerging contemporary artists in the New York arts scene: encompassing photographers, stylists, writers, designers, actors, comedians, dancers, painters, and performance artists. Content is focused on embracing the diverse sexualities of our subjects. By working closely with our fellow artistic innovators, we can help draw attention to a topic that demands discussion. We aspire to be a magazine that inspires conversations and incites desires.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Who do we think we are anyway? </h3> <p>Sex is often used in media as a means for manipulation to get us to buy things, to want things; everything from clothing to hand soap. A plus for pop culture today is that it is beginning to represent different kinds of individuals who's sexualities previously were not recognized. However just simply representing is not enough, we need to help the general public understand LGBT. We hope to create a platform available to the general public as a hope to begin a dialogue, to get people curious. So that LGBT isn't a term of subculture but of just culture in general.</p>

A few years ago, I came up with the idea for MinkeeBlue Tote Bags. I was working with my nonprofit organization when I noticed student moms struggling to carry everything they needed for school and their children. They needed a purse, diaper bag and book bag. I realized that I was just like them, carrying three bags to work with my purse, laptop bag and lunch bag...and sometimes, I'd put my heels in one of those plastic grocery bags and stick that in my purse. I became totally frustrated and questioned, ‘Why am I carrying all these bags?’ Unfortunately, it's typical to see women carrying more than one bag. Since I couldn’t find a bag on the market that would allow me to carry everything I needed for the day while staying organized, I decided to create one. I put my engineering degree to work and committed to designing and making a fashionable everyday ""go to"" tote for work and travel that would eliminate the need to carry multiple bags.

<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">So, How Does it Work?</span><br/>
</h3>
<div>Most tote bags are designed as an ""open hole"" with pockets. We toss our personal items in the bag only for them to get lost at the bottom of the ""black hole"". I've designed MinkeeBlue as a functional stylish tote giving you full control of how you want to organize your personal items in the bag. No more messy bags and no more digging! Each Minkeeblue features a patent pending folding panel in the middle of the bag that transforms your bag. When the panel is in its closed position, it creates an upper and lower compartment. You can organize and separate items normally carried in three bags, in one MinkeeBlue. When the panel is in its open position, it becomes a one compartment tote bag. See photos below and watch our videos (check out the video in the Gallery in the menu bar) to see the versatility MinkeeBlue offers. </div>

Each Minkeeblue features a patent pending folding panel in the middle of the bag that transforms your bag. When the panel is in its closed position, it creates an upper and lower compartment. You can organize and separate items normally carried in three bags, in one MinkeeBlue. When the panel is in its open position, it becomes a one compartment tote bag. See photos below and watch our videos (check out the video in the Gallery in the menu bar) to see the versatility MinkeeBlue offers. 

MinkeeBlue Madison has a top magnetic closure, making it easy to access items in your bag. 


Folding panel in its open position. We use magnetic snaps to keep the panel attached to the side of the bag. All MinkeeBlue totes include a slip pocket to hold your laptop, tablet, files or reading materials. It fits 13"" and 14"" laptops.


Folding panel in its closed position creating a top compartment and lower compartment. Optional add-on includes a detachable wristlet coin purse which can also serve as a key fob.

<h3>Additional Information About Kowy™´s Story </h3>
<p><strong>Welcome to Kowy</strong><strong><sup>TM</sup></strong><strong>, the interchangeable and fun adornment for eyeglasses.</strong></p>
<p>I am Alessandra Marzano, the creator and founder of Kowy<sup>TM</sup>. I am Brazilian born, Naturalized American with an Italian Heritage. A Summa Cum Laude in Marketing, years of experience in many fields including, import/export, fashion and Real Estate. I speak 4 languages and wish I spoke them all. I am an entrepreneur at heart, always having creative business ideas, and a long life dream to build a brand. But nothing until now had made me drop everything in my life to pursue my dream.</p>
<p>My Kowy<sup>TM</sup> idea was the one, which meant everything to me. This product idea gave me a new life direction. It finally made sense to build a name, to build a house of products to enhance people´s lives and a brand which would bring happy moments into our everyday. I decided to pursue this myself, against all odd; not having a lot of capital or help.</p>
<p>Kowy<sup>TM</sup> was one of those ideas which invaded my mind and my thoughts bringing so much passion, I then realized my life would never be the same. I simply got obsessed, so thankfully, here we are!<br/>The idea popped in my mind when at dinner with a friend. I watched at a table next to us, a boy continuously crying, pushing his mom´s hands away who lovingly tried to put on these tiny prescription glasses on the boy´s face. The parents, clearly fatigue and saddened by the situation, had no way of making the glasses more fun or pleasurable to distract the boy´s attention and stay calm.</p>
<p>I then looked at my friend, which coincidently wears prescription glasses, and then BOOMMMM I saw them! I saw them so clearly in my mind! I saw the many different Kowy<sup>TM</sup> flashing thru so fast as a lightning bulb!</p>
<p>I looked back at the boy and (in my mind) and saw him happily playing with different characters and animals and shapes and little mini colorful toys, making the boy not only wanting to wear the glasses but actually getting attached to them.</p>
<p>I sank it in, took a breath while imagining the boy happy playing with his Kowy<sup>TM</sup>, making the parents happy and everyone was back in peace ending the stressful situation. That was it, I had to do them.</p>
<p><strong>Kowy</strong><strong><sup>TM</sup></strong><strong> was born!</strong></p>
<p>Moreover, getting deeper into my research after the fact, I realized how much teenagers often go thru tough times as well when prescribed glasses. They start having issues at school, fights with their friends and even strange episodes at home. Their self-confidence drops, and so does their happiness. Bullying and low self-steam can all be extremely harmful to the individual and consequently those around her (him).</p>
<p>As a woman at 40´s, the inevitable use of prescription glasses is also somewhat near.  I guess I was already dreading this moment and when I watched the boy it was a eureka moment for my issue as well! The use of prescription glasses with jewels and fun styles didn’t seem so boring and upsetting anymore!  And as a fashion lover with an incredible fascination for change, I saw Kowy<sup>TM</sup> taking over all of my glasses temples. Including the sunglasses! Then my creative mind really went wild.</p>
<p><strong>The mesmerizing fashion World</strong></p>
<p>I enjoy and appreciate the world of fashion because of its versatility and power to elevate someone´s self-confidence. A useful and fashionable accessory can improve someone´s life, socially and therefore, personally.</p>
<p>Use your Kowy<sup>TM</sup> on prescription and sunglasses! Mix them, collect them and swap them between your friends. Kowy<sup>TM</sup> is made for bringing happiness to everyone. All over the World!</p>
<p>Kowy<sup>TM</sup> is designed to bring joy to your life!</p>
<p>Let´s make people happy together - one Kowy<sup>TM</sup> at a time! </p>

I am an entrepreneur at heart, always having creative business ideas, and a long life dream to build a brand. But nothing until now had made me drop everything in my life to pursue my dream.
My KowyTM idea was the one, which meant everything to me. This product idea gave me a new life direction. It finally made sense to build a name, to build a house of products to enhance people´s lives and a brand which would bring happy moments into our everyday. I decided to pursue this myself, against all odd; not having a lot of capital or help.
KowyTM was one of those ideas which invaded my mind and my thoughts bringing so much passion, I then realized my life would never be the same. I simply got obsessed, so thankfully, here we are!The idea popped in my mind when at dinner with a friend. I watched at a table next to us, a boy continuously crying, pushing his mom´s hands away who lovingly tried to put on these tiny prescription glasses on the boy´s face. The parents, clearly fatigue and saddened by the situation, had no way of making the glasses more fun or pleasurable to distract the boy´s attention and stay calm.
I then looked at my friend, which coincidently wears prescription glasses, and then BOOMMMM I saw them! I saw them so clearly in my mind! I saw the many different KowyTM flashing thru so fast as a lightning bulb!
I looked back at the boy and (in my mind) and saw him happily playing with different characters and animals and shapes and little mini colorful toys, making the boy not only wanting to wear the glasses but actually getting attached to them.
I sank it in, took a breath while imagining the boy happy playing with his KowyTM, making the parents happy and everyone was back in peace ending the stressful situation. That was it, I had to do them.
KowyTM was born!
Moreover, getting deeper into my research after the fact, I realized how much teenagers often go thru tough times as well when prescribed glasses. They start having issues at school, fights with their friends and even strange episodes at home. Their self-confidence drops, and so does their happiness. Bullying and low self-steam can all be extremely harmful to the individual and consequently those around her (him).
As a woman at 40´s, the inevitable use of prescription glasses is also somewhat near.  I guess I was already dreading this moment and when I watched the boy it was a eureka moment for my issue as well! The use of prescription glasses with jewels and fun styles didn’t seem so boring and upsetting anymore!  And as a fashion lover with an incredible fascination for change, I saw KowyTM taking over all of my glasses temples. Including the sunglasses! Then my creative mind really went wild.
The mesmerizing fashion World
I enjoy and appreciate the world of fashion because of its versatility and power to elevate someone´s self-confidence. A useful and fashionable accessory can improve someone´s life, socially and therefore, personally.
Use your KowyTM on prescription and sunglasses! Mix them, collect them and swap them between your friends. KowyTM is made for bringing happiness to everyone. All over the World!
KowyTM is designed to bring joy to your life!
Let´s make people happy together - one KowyTM at a time!

As a result, people have produced billions of tonnes plastic waste, 79% of which is in landfill and environment.You may not see all that plastic around you, but you're eating it with seafood and drinking it with water - on average, 83% of water samples contain plastic fibers.Sustainable lifestyle requires planning and change of habits. Think about it: taking a reusable bag to a shop sounds so easy, and yet we keep forgetting it at home. We made a product that helps people become more planet-friendly without thinking much: a wallet with a built-in shopping tote. Its innovative addition? A slim side pocket that hides a spacious carry-all bag - just pull it out and use whenever you need it.  Now, there's really not much to remember - we simply don't go to a shop without money and credit cards. In a witty way, GENECIE helps anyone reduce their plastic bag use, easily and effortlessly.We spent months designing and redesigning GENECIE to create a product that's elegant and sophisticated, while intuitive and convenient to use.   Made of soft faux leather and fine-tuned to details - from zippers to linings - GENECIE is made for contemporary women with dynamic lifestyles.Even casually folded, the built-in shopping bag is invisible from the outside. In fact, you'll forget it's even there until you'll be at the counter, asked if you need a plastic bag.   The GENECIE wallet will be available in two colors - Midnight blue and Peach beige. With every wallet, you'll receive a minimal-cut tote bag in a color of your choice.    After spent a month traveling around Asia, Krista (one of the founders) came back broken-hearted - the plastic pollution she experienced there had left a lasting effect on her.She started to rethink her habits and decided to cut down her own plastic use.

<h3>Help Us Rebuild Your Creative Outlet</h3>
<p>On April 5th, 2018, we were among the millions of people who learned that Polyvore suddenly shut down with no warning leaving their dedicated and beautiful community without a home.</p>
<p>#BringBackPolyvore has become a movement and we have been personally touched by every story. This was more than a web destination for many users. It was a place for them to express their creativity and find like-minded people. They deserve a home and it has become our personal mission to make this happen for them.</p>
<p>But the realities involved with building some of these features will require a significant shift in our core business of Fashion.</p>
<h3>This support will help us deliver features that are most missed but difficult to fund with our current business model.</h3>
<p>* Ability to clip images from the web and bring them into ShopLook</p>
<p>* Ability to crop images within our editor</p>
<p>* Addition of text into our editor</p>
<p>* Group features such as groups and group messaging</p>
<p>* [TBD] We are also exploring a way to allow you to import in your old sets</p>
<p>In addition to building these features, some of these funds will be used to support the infrastructure costs that come with supporting them (storage, hosting costs, etc).  If we have learned anything from being in the world of tech, features are expensive to maintain and it is important that we plan properly to avoid being another source of disappointment.</p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Be a part of an unprecedented movement and enable a global community of creators to get their home back.</p>
<p>Here is one of the many personal user stories of impact:</p>
<p>""These tools had helped me through depression, anxiety, and hard times by giving me a place to let my mind wander and be creative and artistic with no judgment or pressure.""</p>
<p>Risks &amp; Challenges</p>
<p>Although we are committed to delivering these features, there are always elements of unpredictability that come with a software development business.</p>
<p>We will work hard to deliver these features but for some, you may see minor adjustments as we dig into building them.</p>
<p>Additionally, developing these features, to the standard of this amazing community, will take time and may involve multiple iterations.</p>
<p>That said, it is our promise that we will not rest until this product can help this amazing community share the beauty of their work with the world.  We greatly appreciate everyone’s patience and understanding as we deliver on this mission :-)</p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We know that not everyone will be in a position to contribute financially. There are many ways you can help:</p>
<p>Help bring awareness to this campaign</p>
<p>Sign up with ShopLook and use the current product (this will help us with other funding goals)</p>

A steady job and income helps provide a sense of purpose, self-worth and hope for future independence. The products we make provide these things, a positive work environment to our homeless veteran employees while teaching them skills to support their reintegration into the workforce.According to the US Dept. of Housing and Urban Affairs: “On any given night, there are over 49,900 United States Veterans sleeping on the streets. Many have found themselves homeless due to the lingering effects of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and substance abuse, which are compounded by a lack of family and social support networks. Additionally, military occupations and training are not always transferable to the civilian workforce, placing some veterans at a disadvantage when competing for employment”.By supporting us, you’ll do more than get a great bag. You’ll be making a personal statement that you also support ending veterans’ homelessness in America.Veterans carried us.

<h3><b>ABOUT ME</b></h3>
<p>Hello everyone! My name is
<b>Jennifer Somoza</b>, I’m a fashion designer and architect from Venezuela. 6 Years
ago I moved to Rome, Italy to study fashion design, I thought it was the time
to follow my dreams and I chose a country with lots of history about haute couture
and craftsmanship. You got to love made in Italy!</p>
<p>I come from a family of hard
workers, who believe that anything could be possible if you have faith, if you
make and follow a plan and if you work to achieve your goals! I’m passionate of
what I do, and my particularity is that I’m not just devoted to womenswear
fashion but I also do all kind of accessories, architecture designs, graphics
and illustrations.</p>
<p> Versatility and freedom of creativity are the fundamentals
of my life and <b>my brand</b>! Jennifer Somoza, created as the alter ego of an
artist, and everything this artist is capable to do, that's the idea, spread
some hope, that we can make our dreams come true if we work for it!....<b>My
purpose</b> is to register my brand and spread it all over the world, creating a
business where fashion, design and architecture could hold hands and walk
through a path of resolving cultural needs. It's a very ambitious plan but I'm
confident I will make it!</p>
<h3><b>THE PROJECT</b></h3>
<p>Since I finished my fashion
academy I’ve had the opportunity to <b>collaborate</b> with photographers and
stylists, I’ve participated to many events and contests, thanks to them, I’ve
had the chance to showcase my fashion pieces in Bratislava, Shanghai, Milan,
Berlin, New York and obviously Venezuela.</p>
<p>Today I feel thrill because
I’ve been contacted by the organization of <b>Vancouver fashion week</b> to invite me
to participate as an emerging designer and showcase my collection in the runway
in March 2016. I can't miss this incredible opportunity, and I think this would
be an excellent moment to successfully launch my brand! </p>
<h3><b>THE CONCEPT</b></h3>
<p>Based on the luxury bags I
recently designed,<b> the pagoda bags</b> will give the input for this new collection!
Pagoda talks about how Society tries so hard to compress us, to classify us
into categories, to make us follow a rigid pattern. “This is the story of a
regular box, house of our souls, our own prison! And this is the moment when we
all start to evolve, deforming the walls that keeps us lock, losing its
symmetry, moving them around. Transform that square shape and make it your own,
to be what you want in your own way! the way how walls deform itself represents
nothing but our <b>hunger for rebellion</b>!”</p>
<p>I will need to sew <b>12
different outfits</b> that would represent this pagoda rebel woman that I will
showcase together with my 6 already handmade Pagoda. Fortunately the academy
where I studied is going to help me with some of the fabrics I will use for the
making of the collection. So, basically I will need to raise <b>9500€</b> that will go
to: </p>
<h3><b>WHAT I NEED</b></h3>
<p>-Vancouver
Fashion Week participation fee </p>
<p>-Airfare to Vancouver </p>
<p>-Accommodations in Vancouver </p>
<p>-Food and transportation in Vancouver </p>
<p>-Additional fabrics and materials to produce the
Collection </p>
<p>-Legal Registration of my brand, VAT number and taxes
here in Italy </p>
<h3><b>WHAT COMES NEXT</b></h3>
<p>After
I raised the necessary for Vancouver fashion week I will occupied myself for
the<b> legal registration of the brand and the VAT number</b> needed to offer my
fashion pieces to buyers in the industry and for the participation of trade
fairs, as well as the creation of an <b>online store, marketing management, public
relations and commercial representatives</b>, I think this is a great opportunity to realize my dream as a
fashion designer, to rock with a strong concept proposal at Vancouver fashion
week, getting in contact with buyers, bloggers and media, to start spreading
the word about my brand worldwide and finally start my business, a business
that not only have fashion in mind but the future cohesion between it and the arts.</p>

<p>My name is Alex Cartwright, founder of Xtreme
Xcursions (Thats me on the fly board for fleet week!).  My team and I are bringing some serious adrenaline-producing
activities to the Bay Area and beyond.  </p><p>With a huge extreme sport culture in northern
California, we see the need for a central place where you can get your
Xtreme fix!  Our international team has traveled
the world over experiencing Xtreme activities from South Island New Zealand to
the jungles of Cambodia.  Now we want to <b>you</b> to experience these activities
in our own beautiful backyard.  </p>
<p>So
channel your inner Iron Man and come fly with us!  Right now we are offering up to %50 off some of our services and the chance to get you in front of the crowds in exchange for some contributions.  </p>
<p>We are launching in the Spring of 2016. By then we hope to be in a
position to offer many more activities from one central waterfront
location.  Here’s what we have going already:</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>Fly-boarding – making your
Iron Man fantasies come to life.</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>Water Zorbing – Yes,
like a hamster rolling around on the Bay in a giant ball! Fun for the whole
family!</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>Kite Boarding – Learn
to harness the power of the wind in one of the world most premier kiting
locations.</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>Jet Ski Tours – The
Bay offers so many areas up for exploration, and the back of a Jet Ski allows
up close action.</p><p>.  Sail Boat Tour Packages - Tour the Bay and beyond on a racing Yacht and be able to experience kiting, jet skiing, and fly boarding anywhere you want with hot showers and a fire-pit on board.</p><p>. Motorized Surfboards - No waves... No problem. Our motorized surf boards have plenty of juice to get your heart pumping.</p><p><br/></p><p>Here is what's in the pipeline for spring:</p><p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">· Skyscraper Zip Lining – the ultimate way to see SF and to beat the traffic!</span><br/></p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>Bungee Jumping – Dare you
take the leap? Perhaps a little push is in order!</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>Spear Fishing Tours –
experience the thrill of spearing your own dinner from the back of a 48ft sail
boat.</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>Shark Diving – We will
give you Shark Week every week (White Shark season permitting)</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>Our Waterfront
location will also stand as a community event space – holding concerts, indie
film showings, events for the local Xtreme community, a visual space for local
artists etc…</p>
<p>We
are seeking funding of $250,000, with these funds we plan to secure the lease on
a waterfront location so we can have a central hub and build a
community for Xtreme adrenaline seekers in the Bay Area. We anticipate this
location being not only a major tourist destination, but also a place where
locals can come and experience something new in their City.  In addition, part of the
funds will go toward purchasing the highest quality equipment with the latest safety standards for our activities. </p>
<p>In
exchange for your support we are offering an array of amazing perks!  We have something for everyone.  Now is the
time to secure for yourself, or treat a friend to some heavily discounted tickets
good for a few of our activities. Or perhaps you want to try everything <i>and</i> bring
your friends – in that case we have the ultimate package for you!  </p>
<p>Stay
tuned for progress updates and please pass this on to your friends, your family,
your neighbors, your Uber driver, your Eaze driver, your SpoonRocket driver,  your Airbnb guests, that rich guy your parents
know, pass it on to everyone you know!  Also join our <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/XtremeXcursions"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">facebook</a> page for exclusive news.   <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Xtreme Xcursions will sell itself, but

<p> </p>
<p>What makes Rita and Phill different is that we've created a unique pattern system that is personalized for each body type.  We've worked with women of many shapes and sizes and have learned from those experiences.  This means that we don’t just change the measurements on each skirt.  We also use a different cut, to make sure the skirt not only fits you, but that it also flatters your specific body type.<br/></p>
<p>We use classic hand-stitched techniques found only at the most exclusive designer brands. From the fabric selection to the construction and stitching, our techniques have been meticulously selected to give you the perfect combination of fashion, comfort and fit.<br/></p>

<p>At Rita and Phill, we’re a small team of women working to change the clothes shopping experience.  We believe that every woman should have a closet full of clothes that not only fit your every curve, but also have the quality of designer brands at the price of regular stores.  </p>

<p><br/></p>
<p><b>WHO ARE RITA AND PHILL?</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>The name Rita and Phill is inspired by the main characters in “Groundhog Day”. In the movie, Phil is stuck in a loop that repeats the same day over and over. The only way he could get out of this time trap and win Rita's heart, was to improve himself and to help those around him.</p>
<p>That's how we view the state of women’s fashion. Every day, women around the world open their closets and look at the same clothes, over and over.  And we generally always feel like we have nothing to wear!<br/></p>
<p></p>
<p>A closet full of clothes and we have nothing to wear.  Why is that?  It's usually because what we mean is: ""I have nothing that I'm <em>excited</em> to wear.""  Maybe the clothes don't fit as well as they used to, or maybe they never fit to begin with and we bought them in the hopes that we would fit them one day.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><em>Why do we accept this endless loop of wearing clothes that don’t really fit us?</em> Because all the stores sell clothes that are made for ""average"" sizes.  Who are these ""average"" sizes anyway?</p>
<p>At Rita and Phill, we've found a way to break that cycle by improving on the fit of your clothes, giving you items that you actually want to wear because it makes you look your best.</p>

HELP A GIRL IN NEED WITH EVERY DONATION
LIN CENTER FOR COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT
We met Dana, the founder of LIN, 5 years ago, and have been impressed by the growth and impact that she’s been able to make on the local community.  When we started Rita and Phill, we knew we wanted to be a part of the support network that she was building.
The LIN Center supports local non-profit organizations by providing them with training, access to grants and providing skilled volunteers.  The center plays an integral role in the local community; it serves as the crucial link between local non-profits that are understaffed and international resources that are looking for organizations to help.


LIN has over 176 partner organizations that range in focus, from women's empowerment to protection of children to LGBT advocacy.

BRIGHTER PATH PROGRAM

The latest PERK we are adding to the campaign is the Caring is Sharing package.  We are working with the VinaCapital Foundation’s Brighter Path Program – for every Caring is Sharing package you select, you will also be donating one professional outfit to a girl in the program.The Brighter Path Program provides impoverished ethnic minority girls with mentoring and scholarships while they attend high school and university. Each student receives a seven-year scholarship (three years of high school and four years of university) that includes support for books, food, housing and uniforms or clothing.  Before receiving the scholarship, the families must commit to support their daughter’s education through the duration of the scholarship.
When you opt for a Caring is Sharing perk with us, you will receive a custom-fit skirt in the style and fabric of your choice.  In addition, you will also donate a custom-fit skirt and blouse for an underprivileged young woman in the Brighter Path Program.  The professional attire will help these young women when they interview for internships and jobs.
THE RITA AND PHILL DIFFERENCE
 
What makes Rita and Phill different is that we've created a unique pattern system that is personalized for each body type.  We've worked with women of many shapes and sizes and have learned from those experiences.  This means that we don’t just change the measurements on each skirt.  We also use a different cut, to make sure the skirt not only fits you, but that it also flatters your specific body type.
We use classic hand-stitched techniques found only at the most exclusive designer brands. From the fabric selection to the construction and stitching, our techniques have been meticulously selected to give you the perfect combination of fashion, comfort and fit.


Our in-house production allows us to provide the highest quality control over every skirt. There are no assembly lines; instead, all our skirts are hand-made with care and attention to detail.

 HOW DOES IT WORK?


We just need 3 simple measurements from you: your waist, hips and thighs.  We plug those numbers into our design system, along with your height, and we create a custom pattern just for your body.  Yes, every skirt undergoes its own analysis, and a separate pattern is made for every single different skirt we make.  Your skirt will receive the TLC it deserves in order to make you look great!
We then manufacture everything in our in-house studio.  And we ship it directly to you.  We cut out all the middlemen and pass along the savings to you.

<p>Did you know that 85% of the global population can not find their shade in products labelled as ""nude?""-- think foundation, lipstick lingerie, and yes, even footwear. </p>
<p>I am Jeneba Barrie, Founder of Jeneba Barrie Nude Footwear.  During the day I am an attorney and at night I become obsessed with creating  the most diverse and inclusive luxury nude (skin-tone) footwear line on the market. We currently have 13 nude (skin-tone) shades in our collection--the most on the market--and we are just getting started. For far too long the market has had a very restrictive and narrow definition of ""nude""--one or two shades of beige. We all know that when it comes to nude shoes, like foundation, one or two shades are not enough. </p>
<p>Our line was created with the objective of fixing this problem. Our product affords everyday women true nude versatility with pumps that can be worn from the boardroom to happy hour and even running errands around town.   </p>
<p>Why Nude or Skintone?</p>

I am Jeneba Barrie, Founder of Jeneba Barrie Nude Footwear.  During the day I am an attorney and at night I become obsessed with creating  the most diverse and inclusive luxury nude (skin-tone) footwear line on the market. We currently have 13 nude (skin-tone) shades in our collection--the most on the market--and we are just getting started. For far too long the market has had a very restrictive and narrow definition of ""nude""--one or two shades of beige. We all know that when it comes to nude shoes, like foundation, one or two shades are not enough. 
Our line was created with the objective of fixing this problem. Our product affords everyday women true nude versatility with pumps that can be worn from the boardroom to happy hour and even running errands around town.   
Why Nude or Skintone?
A good pair of nude shoes gives the wearer a seamless look, it elongates the legs and it is versatile, as you can wear it with anything in your closet. Our line guarantees leg lengthening nudes.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>* 英語に続いて日本語を掲載しています.</p>
<p>暑さに打ち勝つ！持ち運べるボディクーラー、「Cool Human（クール・ヒューマン）」</p>
<p>服の下から冷風を送る充電式のポータブル・ボディクーラーで、あなただけの微気候空間をつくりましょう。</p>
<p>Summer is only 5 months away, and with it comes unbearable heat! Most personal coolers are hand-held and blow air on the face and neck only, thus severely limiting their cooling effect. In contrast, the Cool Human(TM) Portable Body Cooler is a hands-free cooler that  clips on to the belt or pants and is designed to be worn hidden UNDER the clothes and blow a steady stream of air up UNDER your shirt, thus cooling your entire upper body by cooling the microclimate that surrounds you. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1578490445/mmedjaomoftvju45amc3.png"" src=""""/></p>
</div><div>
<p>個人用のクーラーは、手で持って顔や首などに直接冷風を当てるようなものがほとんどです。そのため、冷却効果には限界があります。</p>
<p>その一方、ポータブル・ボディクーラーである「Cool Human（クール・ヒューマン）」はベルトやズボンなどに取り付け、服の下にすっぽりおさまるように設計されています。涼しい風が服の下から体全体に吹き込み、体の周りに微気候空間を作って上半身全体を涼しくすることができます。</p>
<h3> Cool down your body's microclimate, not the whole room! </h3>
<p>Your shirt acts as a closed system, preventing the blowing air from escaping too quickly and allowing it to circulate around your body, creating a microclimate that evaporates your sweat as it forms and cooling you down much more than a wet towel or hand held fan could.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1578490946/briwuzyqjxdbogec23k4.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>部屋全体を冷やすより、体に微気候空間を作ろう！</p>
<p>シャツを着た状態の体は密閉空間のようになっており、空気が体を巡らないため風の通りが悪い状態です。そのため、濡れタオルや手持ち扇風機などよりも効果的な、かいた汗を蒸発させて体を冷やす作用を促す「微気候空間」を作りにくくしています。</p>
<h3> The problem </h3>
<p>Overheating not only causes sweat and discomfort, but may even lead to dangerous health conditions such as heat exhaustion or heatstroke. </p>
<p>Overheating also limits performance in sports and exercise by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reducing muscular endurance</li>
<li>Shifting metabolism from aerobic to anaerobic (unable to exercise as long)</li>
<li>Causing dilation of blood vessels in the skin, leading to reduced blood volume returning to the heart (increased fatigue)</li>
</ul>
<p>The best way of cooling down the body is through the body's own innate mechanism of evaporative cooling, in which sweat produced by the body evaporates in the surrounding air, thus lowering the body's core temperature. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1578656886/xklplod00re0k2ahh2kw.png"" src=""""/></p>
</div><div>
<p>In fact, this is how nearly all of those ""miracle"" cooling shirts work--wicking your sweat through the shirt to the outside where the wind can evaporate it. <br/><br/>  But evaporative cooling is not effective when there is no wind, if you are indoors, or when humidity is high. Without a wind or dry air to act as a catalyst, they are just regular shirts.</p>
<p>体が熱くなりすぎると、汗をかいたり気持ち悪く感じたりするだけでなく、極度の疲労や心臓発作などの健康に害のある症状を引き起こす可能性があります。</p>
<p>また、体が熱くなりすぎることで、スポーツやエクササイズのパフォーマンスが以下のように下がってしまいます：</p>
<p>筋肉の耐性が低下する</p>
<p>代謝状態を好気性から嫌気性に変える (長時間の運動に耐えられなくなる）</p>
<p>皮膚内の血管を拡張子、心臓に戻る血液量を少なくする (疲労感増大につながる)</p>
<p>体の熱を逃す最も効果的な方法は、本来人間の体に備わっている気化冷却機能です。気化冷却とは、人間がかいた汗が空気中に蒸発することで熱を逃す機能で、体の深部の熱を下げてくれる働きがあります。</p>
<h3>Why you need this</h3>
<p>The Cool Human(TM) Portable Body Cooler eliminates these problems by producing air flow where you need it the most--UNDER your clothes. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1578491867/eenpl9mrxycczesbyt5r.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>And it works wonderfully, even when there is no wind or there is high humidity.  ​Your sweat is able to evaporate as soon as it forms, cooling you down significantly no matter what the external conditions are.  </p>
<p>And even better, you don't need to wear a sweat soaked shirt to achieve evaporative cooling.</p>
<p>しかし、気化冷却機能は室内や湿度が高い場合など、十分な空気が通らない場所にいると効果が半減してしまいます。 </p>
<p>そんな時でも、この持ち運べるボディクーラー「Cool Human（クール・ヒューマン）」があれば、衣類の下で風の通り道を作り、風のない湿度の高い場所でも人間の気化冷却機能の効果を発揮させることができます。</p>
<p>どんな外気状態にいても、あなたがかいた汗は空気中に蒸発して体温をしっかりと下げてくれます。</p>
<h2>Excellent cooling in everyday activities</h2>
<p>持ち運べるボディクーラー「Cool Human（クール・ヒューマン）」は、例えばこんなときに効果的に活用できます。</p>

<h3>Why is this cooler different?  </h3>
<p>Some of the main differences between the Cool Human(TM) Portable Body Cooler and other wearable coolers are listed below.  </p>
<p>他のクーラーとは何が違うの？ </p>
<p>持ち運べるボディクーラー「Cool Human（クール・ヒューマン）」 と他のウェアラブルクーラーの主な違いは、下記の通りです。 </p>
<ul><li>
<strong>Invisible.</strong> Curved air input port placed BEHIND the clip, NOT on the outside, allows for unimpeded air flow even when the outside of the cooler is covered by a shirt, thus maintaining strong aeration under the clothes at all times. </li></ul>
<p>服の中に隠すことができます。装置の外側ではなくクリップの後ろに斜めにデザインされた気の取り込み口がついているので、装置がシャツで覆われていても空気をスムーズに取り込むことができ、いつでも通気性の良い状態を保ちます。</p>
<ul><li> <strong>Cools under all conditions. </strong>Effective in poorly ventilated areas or high humidity.</li></ul>
<p>どんな状況でも体の温度を下げます。 換気の悪い場所や多湿な環境でも効果抜群。</p>

暑さに打ち勝つ！持ち運べるボディクーラー、「Cool Human（クール・ヒューマン）」
服の下から冷風を送る充電式のポータブル・ボディクーラーで、あなただけの微気候空間をつくりましょう。
Summer is only 5 months away, and with it comes unbearable heat! Most personal coolers are hand-held and blow air on the face and neck only, thus severely limiting their cooling effect. In contrast, the Cool Human(TM) Portable Body Cooler is a hands-free cooler that  clips on to the belt or pants and is designed to be worn hidden UNDER the clothes and blow a steady stream of air up UNDER your shirt, thus cooling your entire upper body by cooling the microclimate that surrounds you. 


個人用のクーラーは、手で持って顔や首などに直接冷風を当てるようなものがほとんどです。そのため、冷却効果には限界があります。
その一方、ポータブル・ボディクーラーである「Cool Human（クール・ヒューマン）」はベルトやズボンなどに取り付け、服の下にすっぽりおさまるように設計されています。涼しい風が服の下から体全体に吹き込み、体の周りに微気候空間を作って上半身全体を涼しくすることができます。
 Cool down your body's microclimate, not the whole room! 
Your shirt acts as a closed system, preventing the blowing air from escaping too quickly and allowing it to circulate around your body, creating a microclimate that evaporates your sweat as it forms and cooling you down much more than a wet towel or hand held fan could.

部屋全体を冷やすより、体に微気候空間を作ろう！
シャツを着た状態の体は密閉空間のようになっており、空気が体を巡らないため風の通りが悪い状態です。そのため、濡れタオルや手持ち扇風機などよりも効果的な、かいた汗を蒸発させて体を冷やす作用を促す「微気候空間」を作りにくくしています。
 The problem 
Overheating not only causes sweat and discomfort, but may even lead to dangerous health conditions such as heat exhaustion or heatstroke. 
Overheating also limits performance in sports and exercise by:

Reducing muscular endurance
Shifting metabolism from aerobic to anaerobic (unable to exercise as long)
Causing dilation of blood vessels in the skin, leading to reduced blood volume returning to the heart (increased fatigue)

The best way of cooling down the body is through the body's own innate mechanism of evaporative cooling, in which sweat produced by the body evaporates in the surrounding air, thus lowering the body's core temperature. 


In fact, this is how nearly all of those ""miracle"" cooling shirts work--wicking your sweat through the shirt to the outside where the wind can evaporate it.   But evaporative cooling is not effective when there is no wind, if you are indoors, or when humidity is high. Without a wind or dry air to act as a catalyst, they are just regular shirts.
体が熱くなりすぎると、汗をかいたり気持ち悪く感じたりするだけでなく、極度の疲労や心臓発作などの健康に害のある症状を引き起こす可能性があります。
また、体が熱くなりすぎることで、スポーツやエクササイズのパフォーマンスが以下のように下がってしまいます：
筋肉の耐性が低下する
代謝状態を好気性から嫌気性に変える (長時間の運動に耐えられなくなる）
皮膚内の血管を拡張子、心臓に戻る血液量を少なくする (疲労感増大につながる)
体の熱を逃す最も効果的な方法は、本来人間の体に備わっている気化冷却機能です。気化冷却とは、人間がかいた汗が空気中に蒸発することで熱を逃す機能で、体の深部の熱を下げてくれる働きがあります。
Why you need this
The Cool Human(TM) Portable Body Cooler eliminates these problems by producing air flow where you need it the most--UNDER your clothes. 

And it works wonderfully, even when there is no wind or there is high humidity.  ​Your sweat is able to evaporate as soon as it forms, cooling you down significantly no matter what the external conditions are.  
And even better, you don't need to wear a sweat soaked shirt to achieve evaporative cooling.
しかし、気化冷却機能は室内や湿度が高い場合など、十分な空気が通らない場所にいると効果が半減してしまいます。 
そんな時でも、この持ち運べるボディクーラー「Cool Human（クール・ヒューマン）」があれば、衣類の下で風の通り道を作り、風のない湿度の高い場所でも人間の気化冷却機能の効果を発揮させることができます。
どんな外気状態にいても、あなたがかいた汗は空気中に蒸発して体温をしっかりと下げてくれます。
Excellent cooling in everyday activities
持ち運べるボディクーラー「Cool Human（クール・ヒューマン）」は、例えばこんなときに効果的に活用できます。




Lower core body temperature; boost performance in and out of the gym. 

The cooler can also be worn outside the shirt depending on your preference.
このクーラーはあなたの好みに合わせて服の外に装着することもできます。

Why is this cooler different?  
Some of the main differences between the Cool Human(TM) Portable Body Cooler and other wearable coolers are listed below.  
他のクーラーとは何が違うの？ 
持ち運べるボディクーラー「Cool Human（クール・ヒューマン）」 と他のウェアラブルクーラーの主な違いは、下記の通りです。 

Invisible. Curved air input port placed BEHIND the clip, NOT on the outside, allows for unimpeded air flow even when the outside of the cooler is covered by a shirt, thus maintaining strong aeration under the clothes at all times. 
服の中に隠すことができます。装置の外側ではなくクリップの後ろに斜めにデザインされた気の取り込み口がついているので、装置がシャツで覆われていても空気をスムーズに取り込むことができ、いつでも通気性の良い状態を保ちます。
 Cools under all conditions. Effective in poorly ventilated areas or high humidity.
どんな状況でも体の温度を下げます。 換気の悪い場所や多湿な環境でも効果抜群。
 Portable and convenient. Small size, can be taken anywhere.
持ち運びでき、便利です。 小さいサイズで、どこへでも持っていけます。
 Versatile. 3 separate speeds; low, medium and high.
 多目的使用も可。 弱・中・強の3つの異なるスピードに調整可能。


 

Rechargable. Can be recharged using any standard phone or computer recharger.
充電可能。 一般的なケータイやPCの充電器で充電できます。




 

 Silent. Barely audible at the lowest setting with normal ambient sound, and non-obvious at higher air flow settings.
静かな稼働音。 スピードが弱の設定なら若干聞こえる程度、強でも邪魔にならない程度のボリュームです。
 Long-lasting. Up to 12-14 hours of continuous use on a single charge!  
とっても長持ち。 1回の充電で12-14時間程度稼働できます。
 Strong air flow at all speeds. 

弱・中・強、どのスピードでもしっかりした風圧。
 Multi-use. Also functions as a bright LED flashlight for safety. 
 様々な用途に利用可。 安全のためのLEDフラッシュライトとしても機能。


 

 Multiple styles (plain, retro style circuit, futuristic social media). 
 Styles
 プレーン・レトロサーキットデザイン、近未来ソーシャルメディアデザインの複数デザインを取り揃えています。

There is one more real benefit to using the Cool Human(TM) Portable Human Cooler: Cost and energy savings. 

持ち運べるボディクーラー「Cool Human（クール・ヒューマン）」を利用するもう一つのとっておきのメリットは、コストとエネルギー消費を抑えることができる点です。

I love coming up with different characters. I am a firm believer that a good character can encompass and carry an endless amount of stories, be it in a novel, a film or a game. I have long been pre-occupied with how I can create a brand that is based entirely on the characters that I have brought to life. This is essentially how the concept of WearWar was born. Community games have moved into the online world during the last couple of decades. With the help of WearWar, my intention is to return the excitement of community gaming into the real world. I believe that it is enough to truly engage players - everything else will come naturally.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1493121136/u4djphqn9z6pjsb2zvte.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1492901618/ss5yxv15phuv6y25fqx2.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><h3>Wear It and Wage War!</h3><p>The starter series consists of five characters, which you can purchase in both men’s and women’s cut on Indiegogo.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1492806828/y3atotmzvnhcklm9nezx.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>Regarding the gameplay itself, each side of the T-shirt is important: the hero is located on the front, and the back contains their name and who they can defeat.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1492807663/rxwngssx4p9owvsteafp.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><strong>Course of the Game:</strong></p><ul>

This attitude of wanting others to win helps us make inner personal discoveries and fosters the well-being of our community. It helps us to deal with losing, and to differentiate between happiness and triumph. Why shouldn’t we be able to experience a stranger’s triumph over us as a success? A Wearwar player is sexy because they wear their loss with pride, and their opponents’ happy smile symbolizes their prize.</p><p> </p><h3>Why Do I Ask For Your Support?</h3><p>The commercial introduction of the WearWar brand requires:</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1492871933/p7bcs1conikcoynreeew.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><ul>

I am the founder of WearWar. I have been a huge fan of roleplaying and board games since childhood. I love coming up with different characters. I am a firm believer that a good character can encompass and carry an endless amount of stories, be it in a novel, a film or a game. I have long been pre-occupied with how I can create a brand that is based entirely on the characters that I have brought to life. This is essentially how the concept of WearWar was born. Community games have moved into the online world during the last couple of decades. With the help of WearWar, my intention is to return the excitement of community gaming into the real world. I believe that it is enough to truly engage players - everything else will come naturally.Wear It and Wage War!The starter series consists of five characters, which you can purchase in both men’s and women’s cut on Indiegogo.Regarding the gameplay itself, each side of the T-shirt is important: the hero is located on the front, and the back contains their name and who they can defeat.Course of the Game:
Wear a WearWar T-shirt.
Once you meet an opponent, recognize each other as WearWar players! Someone will win, and someone will lose.
Decide for yourselves how you go about the situation.
Take a picture or make a video of the encounter, and post it via the smartphone app to the WearWar community page to your own heroes’ profile! Here you can also update everyone on the possible prize, or how the encounter went down.
In this way, members of the community can check out stories from around the world of others who had been strangers just moments before, all on their favorite characters’ page. They can also scroll through exciting statistics of current character standings. Besides leaving the decision of what the winner’s prize should be in players’ hands, Wearwar also suggests a counter-cultural philosophy to participants, where the notion of winning at all costs is brought into question. This attitude of wanting others to win helps us make inner personal discoveries and fosters the well-being of our community. It helps us to deal with losing, and to differentiate between happiness and triumph. Why shouldn’t we be able to experience a stranger’s triumph over us as a success? A Wearwar player is sexy because they wear their loss with pride, and their opponents’ happy smile symbolizes their prize. Why Do I Ask For Your Support?The commercial introduction of the WearWar brand requires:
A total of 8.000 dollars;
The development of a webshop-based community page;
The development of a native mobile app;
Production of a 500 piece T-shirt stock needed for launching the webshop;
I would also like to strengthen WearWar’s already existing professional team, fund the initial promotions and brand communication essential to the brand launch.
 PerksYou bear no risk! Since the WearWar project is already in its production phase, you are guaranteed to receive your perks, regardless of which ones you have chosen. Up and Coming UpdatesIf the idea of WearWar appeals to you, some special perks will become available to you during Indiegogo’s campaign:
A limited series T-shirt with the amazing sixth character, which you can only acquire here, on Indiegogo.
Loving the character? Become the sole owner of the original hero sketches!
Interested in co-creating new characters? No problem!

So join with us on this journey and be a part of it every step of the way.  We will send out several updates throughout the entire process making sure our backers are up-to-date on any important information.  We want to create a bond, with our backers, we want to build a connected family, because ultimately only You and your support is what is making this possible, to turn our dream into a reality.  We are excited to grow and We promise to enlarge the brand into more fields than only watches.<br/>Backup our project and be sure that this is a little investment at the beginning, to raise even more in the future!</p>
<h2>Who are we and how did it start?</h2>
<p>Started by young and ambitious entrepreneurs from the very heart of Europe. We are Sports and Watch enthusiasts.

<h1>What is our vision?</h1>
<p>Beautiful design, simplicity and high quality engineering excellence built into one timepiece.</p>
<p>We are here to set the new standard, step up the game and make products that everybody wants to grab right from the screen. </p>
<p>These are the watches you do not want to miss out on! You can easily wear it with a shirt during active lifestyle or with a suit on business meetings.</p>
<p>In a nutshell, it's a minimalistic yet functional watch with 45mm (men) / 36-40mm (women) case and a comfy high precision stainless steel.  </p>
<p>Lion was designed together with most delicate Italian watch crafters after their experience working for more than 20 years in this field. </p>
<p>Eternity are not just a luxurious watches which are made by most us, the most passionate and ambitional young people, it’s also a story teller which tells what’s beneath the outer sight. Our customers write about as that our watches would be more accurately labeled as the “Thin Line Underneath The Past And The Present."" Why? Well, that becomes less vague as to when we start seeing our watches as story tellers rather then just a time teller. Which is what Eternity accomplished with it’s watches by merging the finest luxuries and stories through a contemporary relation in it’s watches. </p>

Who are we and how did it start?
Started by young and ambitious entrepreneurs from the very heart of Europe. We are Sports and Watch enthusiasts. We have been obsessed with watches our entire life and got fed up paying for overpriced name brand watches. So now we're doing it ourselves. We started this as a small project as friends and now we are hoping to push it forward!



What is our vision?
Beautiful design, simplicity and high quality engineering excellence built into one timepiece.
We are here to set the new standard, step up the game and make products that everybody wants to grab right from the screen. 
These are the watches you do not want to miss out on! You can easily wear it with a shirt during active lifestyle or with a suit on business meetings.
In a nutshell, it's a minimalistic yet functional watch with 45mm (men) / 36-40mm (women) case and a comfy high precision stainless steel.  
Lion was designed together with most delicate Italian watch crafters after their experience working for more than 20 years in this field. 
Eternity are not just a luxurious watches which are made by most us, the most passionate and ambitional young people, it’s also a story teller which tells what’s beneath the outer sight. Our customers write about as that our watches would be more accurately labeled as the “Thin Line Underneath The Past And The Present."" Why?

Which is what Eternity accomplished with it’s watches by merging the finest luxuries and stories through a contemporary relation in it’s watches.

<b>Our Campaign's Goals
</b><div><p>We have been designing and handcrafting fine and functional products in non-swing machine studio since 2012 only by hand &amp; heart. For our Indiegogo campaign we hand-picked 6 of 12 product's line that we have in our collection and we could possibly reduce the prices by controlling production costs accessible to everyone with the same premium quality.</p></div>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1470237836/indi_plan_tdd8u9.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
</div>
<div style=""text-align: center;"">
<p></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Simply by avoiding ""Pricing Filters"" which caused marke-up pricing, we can serve our final costumer via our Indiegogo campaign directly. Your perks will be utilised for providing materials and costs of making without any markup. Ignoring ""Pricing Filters"" in the diagram above allows us to meet our <b>30 to 40% price reduction only in limited quantity</b> in this campaign in compare with our online and retail prices. Our wooden packages, marketing &amp; advertising costs, online fees, photography and huge percentage of middleman commissions and so on will be excluded in pricing method exclusively for our campaign. One of our costly crafting stage is dying and conditioning (curing the cowhide). Now, according to our campaign's goals we will be offering only Pure Natural Color Vegetable-Tanned cowhide. As result, we can handcraft same quality goods with no luxury and made-up price. <br/></p>
<p>But why is that? Just because of the context provided by Indiegogo that helps us serve you directly rather than online platforms that has been leading us not only to sell through their policy but also sell in complex and costly marketing plan defined in their selling framework for makers like us.</p>

<p><strong>THE STORY OF CRAFTED COCO®</strong><br/></p>
<p>Crafted coco is a leather goods brand founded in 2012. The name Coco is influenced by coconut's properties. From its durability, nature, color, even its taste. The strong feeling after drinking coconut milk and the time has taken for a coconut to get rich, all are metaphors of leather crafting process and making premium leather goods only by the hands of one craftsman. ​The founder and designer of crafted coco® leather goods was born in 14, February 1984. He has been involved with design and particularly with tendency of minimal product design since 2002. Graduated from Australian design collage. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><strong>DESIGN </strong><strong>PROCESS &amp; CURING LEATHER</strong><br/>By using CAD and providing template we design our products by passion and sincerity. We believe that accuracy and true proportion now a days is one of the most important factors in terms of design process which is lost in the handcrafted goods’ market. Crafting process starts with hand- cutting, hand-dying, stitching and ends with our own organic and in-house formulated leather milk and conditioner and here our secret starts working the best. The water repellent and Leather sealant makes the leather supple and durable. Almost all of scratches will be gone by buffing. Our Leather conditioner made of 8 different extra virgin organic substances that formulated &amp; patented by us and has been outsourced from 4 different countries to achieve premium quality and adorable look. This the most costly stage of crafting process for us. No mineral and petroleum based ingredient has been used in its formula. It means the more the leather works the more beautiful it becomes. There is no sewing machine in our workshop and every process has been done only by hand! Our products are limited edition according to the individual maker and designer and also production speed on the other hand which is quiet time-consuming.</p>

<p>​Our inspiration coming from both  heart of classical look and nature of modern product design. We start to pitch an idea simply with pencils and paper. There is where we meet concept development and boosting the durability aspect of our products while we are designing. When our inspiration begins then our principals must be fulfilled. When I feel to remember the seamless and structural organs in the nature like a leaf that its structure hold it up and How layers of coconut  fits together to  support the core, our journey gets started and it is what you can feel in the DNA of crafted coco, a coconut with the charismatic smell of leather that is not made for monkeys.<br/></p>

</div></div>","Our Campaign's Goals
We have been designing and handcrafting fine and functional products in non-swing machine studio since 2012 only by hand & heart. For our Indiegogo campaign we hand-picked 6 of 12 product's line that we have in our collection and we could possibly reduce the prices by controlling production costs accessible to everyone with the same premium quality.





Simply by avoiding ""Pricing Filters"" which caused marke-up pricing, we can serve our final costumer via our Indiegogo campaign directly. Your perks will be utilised for providing materials and costs of making without any markup. Ignoring ""Pricing Filters"" in the diagram above allows us to meet our 30 to 40% price reduction only in limited quantity in this campaign in compare with our online and retail prices. Our wooden packages, marketing & advertising costs, online fees, photography and huge percentage of middleman commissions and so on will be excluded in pricing method exclusively for our campaign. One of our costly crafting stage is dying and conditioning (curing the cowhide). Now, according to our campaign's goals we will be offering only Pure Natural Color Vegetable-Tanned cowhide. As result, we can handcraft same quality goods with no luxury and made-up price. 
But why is that? Just because of the context provided by Indiegogo that helps us serve you directly rather than online platforms that has been leading us not only to sell through their policy but also sell in complex and costly marketing plan defined in their selling framework for makers like us.

Lifetime Guarantee

We believe simplicity, functionality and durability give second hand value to a product. Most of our products has been sold to the U.S.A, The Netherlands, Germany, Spain, The U.K, Norway, Ireland and Singapore. We believe that accuracy and true proportion nowadays is one of the most important factors in terms of design process which is lost in the handcrafted goods’ market. We have lots of true craft experience and we value our costumers. These are the reason behind the No Expiration Lifetime Guarantee for every single purchase that will be made.


What Crafted coco’s lifetime guarantee means? 
​It simply means WHENEVER your purchase takes apart you will send it back to us and if it is repairable we will prepare it, if not you will receive a brand new item in same color! 

What the warranty does cover?

All Hardwares (snap fasteners, buckles, studs, rivets, joints, rings and etc.)
Non functionality of hardwares or malfunctioning of any components of our products.








THE STORY OF CRAFTED COCO®
Crafted coco is a leather goods brand founded in 2012. The name Coco is influenced by coconut's properties. From its durability, nature, color, even its taste. The strong feeling after drinking coconut milk and the time has taken for a coconut to get rich, all are metaphors of leather crafting process and making premium leather goods only by the hands of one craftsman. ​The founder and designer of crafted coco® leather goods was born in 14, February 1984. He has been involved with design and particularly with tendency of minimal product design since 2002. Graduated from Australian design collage. 

DESIGN PROCESS & CURING LEATHERBy using CAD and providing template we design our products by passion and sincerity. We believe that accuracy and true proportion now a days is one of the most important factors in terms of design process which is lost in the handcrafted goods’ market. Crafting process starts with hand- cutting, hand-dying, stitching and ends with our own organic and in-house formulated leather milk and conditioner and here our secret starts working the best. The water repellent and Leather sealant makes the leather supple and durable. Almost all of scratches will be gone by buffing. Our Leather conditioner made of 8 different extra virgin organic substances that formulated & patented by us and has been outsourced from 4 different countries to achieve premium quality and adorable look. This the most costly stage of crafting process for us. No mineral and petroleum based ingredient has been used in its formula. It means the more the leather works the more beautiful it becomes. There is no sewing machine in our workshop and every process has been done only by hand! Our products are limited edition according to the individual maker and designer and also production speed on the other hand which is quiet time-consuming.






TOOLS, MATERIALS & HARDWARES​We are utilizing premium materials, from U.S. made cowhides, rivets, belt buckles to French traditional Threads and Sam Browne solid brass studs. Cowhides are vegetable-tanned and has been outsourced from Australia, The U.S.A, Poland, Vietnam & Thailand. We know without using professional tools we won’t end with quality products. ​Now we are going toward our making and hand crafting method by having our hands on the world’s best leather crafting tools from Vergez Blanchard from France to Japanese Kyoshin Elle. We also costume made our fasteners applied in our products from one of the world's reputed hardware maker from Japan, such as copper and solid brass.






Leather Types
What kind of leather we will be using for making our products?
Australian ​Top grain, grade A, 100% genuine vegetable-tanned cowhide in four different thicknesses. | 1.5 | 2.2 | 3.5 | 4.5 | Millimetre.

<h3>Who are we?</h3>
<p>We are a group of college students from the Czech Republic. One day, we were wondering ""what to do with our spare time?"" That's when the idea came. And here we are now, trying to achieve our goal. Starting new brand and setting a new trend.</p>
<p>We are proud to introduce our first product - Woodley watch. Handmade out of bamboo wood with a leather band and the heart of the watch - Japan movement Miyota which provides an accurate display of time. The design is unisex - it is both for ladies and gentlemen.</p>
<p>What is best about the natural material - wood? Every piece is a little bit different, thanks to the structure of the wood; every piece is unique, original, just as a person that wears it on the wrist.</p>
<p>But what is even better? Wood is very easy to customize. Do you want a personalized gift for your husband or wife, boyfriend or girlfriend, brother or sister? That's no problem; we can help you make a watch with your desired inscription.</p>

<p>The design of the watch is minimalistic, but we want to meet the requirements of all potential customers; therefore, you can choose out of 3 different watch face designs.

<p>My name is Jahise LeBouef, a 21 year old designer from Washington, DC. I recently graduated from New York University studying costume design in the drama department. To some, deciding to make the switch from pursuing costume design for theatre/film to fashion design may not seem like too big of a decision, however there are many differences. Therefore, in a lot of ways, I am starting a new. Teaching myself fashion techniques, and making new connections that I didn't pick up during my studies because they were centered around another form of design. </p>
<p>This collection represents that decision for me. It will be the first time I step out and introduce myself as a fashion designer, not a costume designer. The first time I see a whole collection that will be released for purchase lifted off the page of my sketchbook. This is a big deal for me because I have seen very few people wearing my work.</p>
<p>Which brings me to, this campaign! You all will help me achieve that goal of launching pretty much my career, getting people to wear my designs, stamping that I am a fashion designer because things will not stop after this collection drops, it is just a jump start for the 'LeBouef' brand as a whole. Designing a line comes with a lot of production costs. Materials, manufacturing fees, and finishes, are half the battle to produce the samples I need to put together the other half; a showcase of the line when it is completed. From there I will build on a made to order process.</p>
<p>I have a lot of different sides to me, and all of the 'LeBouef' collections will represent that. I decided to have STAMP (a streetwear collection) be my first because it is closer to home. It is inspired by the streets of DC I grew up in, with my own twist. I am in a way paying homage; saying thank you for grooming me into the artist I am. Hence the DC slang word being the title. While I am located in New York currently, I plan on having my first showcase, in my hometown District.</p>
</div><div>
<p>I am asking for $5000. To get the best materials, the best people to make it to guarantee that it is made with great care &amp; quality, and finished with the utmost detail (embroidery, closures, etc.),to purchase clothing labels, and packaging, to put together a website for easy ordering, to lock in a venue for the showcase, and a team to make the event happen.</p>
<p>Also in the name of branding myself, if a certain amount is donated, I will give to the donater a neoprene, embroidered handmade by me, 'LeBouef' Tee as a thank you.</p>
<p>Every little bit counts, and if I do not make my whole goal, what was donated will still go toward STAMP, and costs will be cut and/or made up somewhere and somehow, but your help is greatly needed.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>I understand that not all can help in the monetary sense, but please know sharing and getting the word out is a huge help as well.</p>
<p>I cannot wait to share with the world all that 'LeBouef' has to offer, and I hope you enjoy STAMP.</p>
<p>Thank you greatly,</p>

<p>The thing that we appreciate most about fashion and art is that imagination is endless. Rêve de jour invites you to join in our proposition to provide a space where talented artists and fashion designers can build, advance, and host their collections under one platform. Along with housing multiple up and coming designers and artists under one roof, Rêve de jour will also be an ecommerce store and a virtual learning experience for creatives.</p>
<p>One of the main concepts is brand development as well as portfolio expansion for various artistic disciplines including fashion design, photography, fashion styling, makeup artistry, and modeling. Selected collections will have access to Rêve de jour’s in-house photography studio as well as a team of professionals to provide and assist with editorials, ad campaigns, and media content. In addition, Rêve de jour will also establish a nationwide registry for the aforementioned fields but also including influencers, web designers, illustrators, and graphic designers so that inquiring brands can easily connect with creatives in their local region or market.</p>
<p>      Although all demographic groups are encouraged to submit their collections, we would like to be a catalyst in amplifying the production and access to African American art and fashion. This also extends to all other African diasporic ethnic groups. Your donations and contributions will undoubtedly support the visions of hundreds of young creatives through this campaign.</p> <p>How it benefits artists + designers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Creative vendors set their own retail prices and choose how many pieces they would like to be featured. They will only pay for their selected packages, which will come with features such as curated editorials and social media content for their brand.</li>
<li>The retail store will feature a photography studio and professional equipment where students and creators can have a space to fuel their projects.</li>
<li>They will have access to a team of professionals to produce quality editorial photoshoots, videos, and media content to take their brands to further horizons. Designers will have the option to have editorials and ad campaigns curated and executed by a team of stylists, photographers, and creative directors.</li>
<li>Rêve de jour will also have internships for creative fields in areas such as fashion styling, photography, makeup, and hair to boost portfolio building.</li>
</ul>
<p>Customer perks:</p>
<ul>
<li>Patrons will have the unique shopping experience of an in store + online platform to purchase art and fashion from emerging designers.</li>
<li>Rêve de jour will provide an inside look at projects via a Youtube channel. We will also feature a virtual learning experience for students and all others who are interested in creative fields.</li>
<li>Work with us! Employees will gain hands on experience throughout all aspects of Rêve de jour. These include retail, photography, merchandising,and much more. Our purpose is to help you grow!</li>
<li>Rêve de jour will also implement a location and portfolio based registry for photographers, models, stylists, hair artists, makeup artists, and influencers so that brands can easily search, select, and hire for assignments. There will also be a separate registry dedicated to graphic designers, illustrators, art direction, branding, and advertising.</li>
<li>Patrons don't have to be designers to access our photography studio. All creatives are welcome to come build their portfolio or gain hands-on experience.</li>

<h2>Idea behind wtchout.com</h2>
<p>The idea of the wrist cover was born in a Finnish forest. I started a new hobby, trail running, in summer 2017. I fell in love with it instantly and bought a lot of new equipment. One of my new purchases was a sports watch that measures the heart rate on my wrist. It also helps me to navigate and prevents me from getting lost in the forest. Summer was followed by cooler weather – my watch did not feel comfortable anymore. My wrist got cold, because I had to wear the watch between my coat sleeve and glove. I instantly started to plan a solution to the problem. Because of my background as a craft teacher, it was easy for me to sew some prototypes of wrist covers. After one year of testing (with family and friends), sewing more prototypes and further testing, I completed the final product – the wtchout.com wrist cover was born. The idea behind wtchout.com is new, and the design has therefore been protected by applying for an international PCT patent.</p>

<h2>Goals</h2>
<p>Wtchout.com wrist cover is designed to keep you warm and comfortable. It is a simple solution to prevent cold chills.

Although it is difficult to purchase masks worldwide due to COVID-19, after seeing that many people are uncomfortable and having a hard time due to poor quality products, we are strengthening our team, holding many meetings, and working together on this product development.Our team challenges with ideas developing numerous products to collect crowdfunding.We are checking all risk factors related to project planning, production and transportation and we are doing our best to ensure quick delivery after the campaign is over.Starting with the INDIEGOGO campaign, we are preparing a distribution channel allowing customers to purchase products and various filters. Hence, we are preparing stock in advance for sponsors who want to purchase additional filters and products.",10.0,2,"1 Campaign

<p><i>Learn how you sleep and boost your energy for the day  </i></p>
<p>When we read about sleep and best practices to have a good night’s sleep, it often looks as though there is an universal solution for everybody. But is that really the case? Should all people wake up in the lightest phase of sleep and go to bed around 11pm?  </p>
<p>We want to give you a tool to check your sleep performance, then find your best sleep pattern based on both short and long-term feedback.</p>
<div data-id=""17277894""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""> </figure></div>
<p>So how will this tool work?  </p>
<p>A/B testing consists of two parts. First it helps you measure your subjective evaluation of sleep quality after various sleep patterns. Second it will objectively check the condition of your brain.  </p>
<p>1. After each sleep you will be given a short test in which you estimate your sleep quality and sleepiness after waking on VAS. This self-evaluation system records changes in the subjective reception of your sleep. This is then combined with metabolic and sleep-staging data in order to provide information about the best sleep pattern to suit you.  </p>
<p>2. As a voluntary extra option, you will have the possibility to try two short games which measure your mental capabilities after sleep. The working memory test will check your perception and working memory condition upon waking. The cognition test will check your cognitive capability. During the first ten days, Neuroon Open will gather data from the tests to personalize its analytic software. After this period, you will be informed about your daily results compared to the average, allowing you to choose the best sleep pattern for your top mental condition.  </p>
<p>These two methods help you to optimize Neuroon Open’s sleep-adjustment tools according to your needs. These tools include artificial dawn, bedroom conditions, specific sleep stage awakenings and optimal time-schedules for falling asleep and waking up.  </p>
<p>In short: they will help you sleep like a child.</p>

<p>The brain has the innate ability to act as a virtual reality generator, generating complex visual scenes, scenarios and imaginary characters, in the form of dreams. Lucid dreaming is a metacognitive state within a dream, which may enable the dreamer to know that they are dreaming or even give them full intellectual ability and volitional control over the dream.<br/><br/>Sounds familiar? According to a meta-analysis of lucid dream prevalence and frequency studies, no less than half of you reading this may have experienced at least one lucid dream in your life! The authors of the meta-analysis have proposed that “the capacity for lucid dreaming is widespread”!</p>

<p>Lucid dreaming is thought to be a trainable skill that<a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22841958"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""> has been demonstrated</a> to increase through the use of cognitive and <a href=""https://journals.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/index.php/IJoDR/article/view/13044"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">external stimulation</a> techniques. Both techniques are features of Neuroon Open!</p>
<p>Neuroon Open will use a combination of methods, including guided audio sessions (similar to guided audio mindfulness sessions that e.g. HeadSpace app uses) and external stimuli (light/sound/vibration) to help induce lucid dreams more reliably and easily. </p>
<div data-id=""17277907""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""> </figure></div>
<p>Cognitive techniques are audio sessions that you use before falling asleep- there are similar to guided audio mindfulness sessions that e.g. HeadSpace app uses (headspace.com).  </p>
<p>External stimulation consists of light and vibration stimulation provided you while you are asleep, in REM sleep. You can find a simplified scheme of this stimulation (based on F. Paul, M. Schädlich, D. Erlacher, Journal of Dream Research Volume 7, No. 1, 2014).</p>

<p>Nowadays there is no space to stop doing things and focus on calming your mind and body, and yet the benefits of meditation are priceless. With Neuroon Open we provide guided mindfulness meditation sessions. For those who are unfamiliar with the term: mindfulness meditation is a basic form of meditation in which one concentrates on his or her inner self. </p>
<p> It begins with breath awareness and builds from there. Whenever you find your mind full of thoughts, you return your awareness back to breathing. Because it provides an opportunity to explore one’s mind without judgement or resentment, it is widely used as an integral part in cognitive therapies (Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy or MBCT for short). </p>
<p>With Neuroon Open you can start meditating whenever you feel you need it: at home, at the office or outdoors. The benefits from meditation are visible even after 2 hours of practice. </p>
<div data-id=""17277915""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""> </figure></div>
<p><b>Neuroon Open meditation</b> feature consists of the three components:  </p>
<p><b>1. Guided audio meditation sessions.</b> Mindfulness meditation audio sessions will interact with your personal physiology based on brain wave readings and pulse oximetry. For example, when you are calm, you will be guided in a different way than when you are tense and nervous. Guidance will be adjusted to these parameters and will change in the middle of the session if your mood dramatically changes. Neuroon Open is the first device that guides your meditation session based on EEG and pulse oximetry in real time.  </p>
<p><b>2. Recording option.</b> Neuroon Open will record your EEG readings, movement and pulse, along with any variations in heart rate during each meditation session. You can compare different sessions and see your progress and the influence of external factors on your mood. It’s not only the mind that alters the way your body functions; your body changes your way of thinking, too.  </p>
<p><b>3. Biofeedback. </b>The Neuroon App gives you the chance to choose which form of feedback you’d prefer and what you’d like from the mask, for example, vibration when dominant brainwaves are alpha or light stimuli while your pulse is raised and unstable. You can customize your biofeedback depending on your needs. It’s all up to you.</p>

<p><i>Design your perfect wakeup and get energy for the whole day  </i></p>
<p>You might have noticed that it is much easier to wake up when it’s already after sunrise and sunny outside. When you wake up in very dark room you have many difficulties avoiding sleep inertia and getting out of bed on time.  </p>
<p>Neuroon Open simulates the light of a slowly-breaking dawn so that you wake up the natural way. The sleep tracker eliminates morning grogginess by waking you at the optimal moment.  </p>
<p>When it’s time to wake up, the mask will gradually fill with light that simulates a natural dawn. If you don’t wake up, Neuroon will add gentle vibrations followed by a final audio alarm from your mobile phone.  </p>
<div data-id=""17277924""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""> </figure></div>
<p>Neuroon Open allows you to choose out of which phase of sleep you’d like to wake up. For some people the optimal phase to be woken out of is light sleep. For some it’s REM. Using the Neuroon Open app, you will be able to choose. Additionally, while analyzing the EEGs of sleeping people during the product development stage, we discovered that before waking up there is a great deal of what is called “micro wakeups”. We added an option under the “automatic” button an option to be woken up from these micro wakeups.  </p>
<p>You can choose:  </p>
<p>1. If you want to be woken up by light or not  </p>
<p>2. If you want to be woken up using vibration or a ringtone, both or neither  </p>
<p>3. If you want to use smart wakeups, meaning you can pick a time when the mask should start to gently wake you up before the final alarm (as well as the sleep phase you would like to start waking up in).  </p>
<div data-id=""17281099""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><p> </p>

<p> <i>Control your home while you sleep  </i></p>
<p>Have you ever wished your bedroom lighting would automatically turn up when you get out of bed in the middle of the night? Maybe you’d like other adjustments made on your behalf.  </p>
<p>Of course Neuroon won’t clean your apartment for you but it can definitely make your sleep routine easier and help you sleep better.  </p>
<p>So how does it work?  </p>
<p>As has already been noted, Neuroon Open is doing sleep data analysis in real time. All of the recorded signals are forwarded to different algorithms, which can then detect various events. After that those events can be further fed into your home network.  </p>
<p>To begin we plan to integrate Neuroon Open with IFTTT. This is a free web-based service that can be used to create chains of simple conditional statements, called “applets”. Each applet consists of a trigger and an action. We would like to program a few triggers for the mask that can then be integrated with other smart home devices compatible with IFTTT.</p>
<div data-id=""17179963""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img alt=""Adjust your bedroom to your sleep"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://indiegogo-media-prod-cld-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1500572798/faiu4zoad0uyged5wwmf.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><figcaption>Adjust your bedroom to your sleep</figcaption></figure></div>
<p> </p>
<p>Triggers that will be implemented for this campaign include:  </p>
<p>1. The moment of falling asleep  </p>
<p>2. REM and NREM detection  </p>
<p>3. Exact wake-up moment, or the moment the mask is removed  </p>
<p>With such triggers it will be possible to:  </p>
<p>- Connect Neuroon Open with your smart hi-fi set and so that the volume is reduced when you fall asleep  </p>
<p>- Connect Neuroon Open with smart lightning in the home, making it shine gradually every time you wake during the night and take off the mask to go to the bathroom  </p>
<p>- Connect Neuroon Open with your Nest and lower the temperature in your room when you enter the REM phase of sleep  </p>
<p>Of course there are a great deal more possibilities for smart home integrations. </p>
<p>It all depends which IoT devices you use at home. It also depends on the number of triggers we program – but given Neuroon Open is open source, why not to program some useful solutions yourself?</p>

<p>We want you to get the most from our work. That’s why we have decided to make out device open-source and share our algorithms. This is what makes Neuroon Open unique.</p>
<div data-id=""17277931""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://indiegogo-media-prod-cld-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1500572799/lthusbfgpxwaficjqw1h.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></figure></div>
<p> </p>
<p>Our product is now transparent, available to the experts who can audit the code and provide constructive feedback as to what we can make better.  </p>
<p>It is verifiable. Researchers using Neuroon for their experiments can see where the results come from and can track the resulting data to electric circuits in the mask.  </p>
<p>It is accessible to DIY and Quantified Self-enthusiasts as it provides SDK and raw data access.  </p>
<p>Its functions may be extended or enhanced with custom apps and tools. With open APIs and data formats, it’s ready for integration with existing and upcoming technologies.  </p>
<p>In an unlikely worst case scenario, if we as a company decided to withdraw our product it could easily be resurrected by a collective of enthusiastic individuals.  </p>
<p>We hope that together we can create a new open standard for exploring and enhancing our minds.  </p>
<p>On the start day of the Kickstarter campaign we will release all of our work-in-progress:  </p>
<p>- Electronic design files  </p>

<p>For our product to be truly successful is to provide a new standard, an open platform for working with your sleep, dreams and meditating mind.</p>
<p>It can only happen with mass adoption and thriving and healthy community around Neuroon Open. The most important part of which, next to the early adopting customers, is the community of developers, makers, FLOSS hackers, diy coders, researchers, etc. Shortly, the people creating new layers of tools and research upon our part of the work.  </p>
<p><b>Clean and well-documented open-source Software Development Kit  </b></p>
<p>In order to make it comfortable and rewarding we intend to provide the ever-growing set of clean and extensive documentation and real-life examples of usage of our SDK and other tools.  </p>
<p>Imagine creating your own tools, algorithms and research with scripts as simple as the following conceptual Python snippet:  </p>

</div></div>","Neuroon Open is made of soft foam that adapts to the shape of your face       You can easily sleep on your side with Neuroon Open     Press kit available here              The most advanced sleep tracker on the market!  Neuroon Open is an advanced sleep tracker that uses build-in sensors to measure your sleep.  What parameters does Neuroon Open measure?  - brainwaves (1-channel EEG- Fp1-Fp2)  - heart rate (pulse oximeter)  - oxygen saturation (pulse oximeter)  - changes in the skin temperature (thermometer)  - movement (accelerometer)  All this information is processed by our core sleep-staging algorithm and then used to build your personal sleep staging, which is shown in Neuroon App. In the morning you can read EXACTLY when you fell asleep, when you had the fastest heart rate and when the slowest. 
Thanks to this data, Neuroon Open algorithms can show you a detailed architecture of your sleep, calculate your sleep efficiency and what is the most important for you, advise how to improve your sleep habits by suggesting tools (such as meditation) to get a better night’s sleep.
 
After sleep you can read all the data in the Neuroon Open App
Every single feature in Neuroon Open works due to the mask’s ability to measure sleep metrics in such a detailed manner. And most importantly for most of the features: sleep analysis takes place in REAL TIME!

Learn how you sleep and boost your energy for the day  
When we read about sleep and best practices to have a good night’s sleep, it often looks as though there is an universal solution for everybody. But is that really the case? Should all people wake up in the lightest phase of sleep and go to bed around 11pm?  
We want to give you a tool to check your sleep performance, then find your best sleep pattern based on both short and long-term feedback.
 
So how will this tool work?  
A/B testing consists of two parts. First it helps you measure your subjective evaluation of sleep quality after various sleep patterns. Second it will objectively check the condition of your brain.  
1. After each sleep you will be given a short test in which you estimate your sleep quality and sleepiness after waking on VAS. This self-evaluation system records changes in the subjective reception of your sleep. This is then combined with metabolic and sleep-staging data in order to provide information about the best sleep pattern to suit you.  
2. As a voluntary extra option, you will have the possibility to try two short games which measure your mental capabilities after sleep. The working memory test will check your perception and working memory condition upon waking. The cognition test will check your cognitive capability. During the first ten days, Neuroon Open will gather data from the tests to personalize its analytic software. After this period, you will be informed about your daily results compared to the average, allowing you to choose the best sleep pattern for your top mental condition.  
These two methods help you to optimize Neuroon Open’s sleep-adjustment tools according to your needs. These tools include artificial dawn, bedroom conditions, specific sleep stage awakenings and optimal time-schedules for falling asleep and waking up.  
In short: they will help you sleep like a child.

Your entrance to the world of lucid dreaming

The brain has the innate ability to act as a virtual reality generator, generating complex visual scenes, scenarios and imaginary characters, in the form of dreams. Lucid dreaming is a metacognitive state within a dream, which may enable the dreamer to know that they are dreaming or even give them full intellectual ability and volitional control over the dream.Sounds familiar? According to a meta-analysis of lucid dream prevalence and frequency studies, no less than half of you reading this may have experienced at least one lucid dream in your life! The authors of the meta-analysis have proposed that “the capacity for lucid dreaming is widespread”!
The system we present to you is the most advanced on the market due to its professional sleep tracker and artificial algorithm methods.
Lucid dreaming is thought to be a trainable skill that has been demonstrated to increase through the use of cognitive and external stimulation techniques. Both techniques are features of Neuroon Open!
Neuroon Open will use a combination of methods, including guided audio sessions (similar to guided audio mindfulness sessions that e.g. HeadSpace app uses) and external stimuli (light/sound/vibration) to help induce lucid dreams more reliably and easily. 
 
Cognitive techniques are audio sessions that you use before falling asleep- there are similar to guided audio mindfulness sessions that e.g. HeadSpace app uses (headspace.com).  
External stimulation consists of light and vibration stimulation provided you while you are asleep, in REM sleep. You can find a simplified scheme of this stimulation (based on F. Paul, M. Schädlich, D. Erlacher, Journal of Dream Research Volume 7, No. 1, 2014).

Prepare your body and mind for the night

Nowadays there is no space to stop doing things and focus on calming your mind and body, and yet the benefits of meditation are priceless. With Neuroon Open we provide guided mindfulness meditation sessions. For those who are unfamiliar with the term: mindfulness meditation is a basic form of meditation in which one concentrates on his or her inner self. 
 It begins with breath awareness and builds from there. Whenever you find your mind full of thoughts, you return your awareness back to breathing. Because it provides an opportunity to explore one’s mind without judgement or resentment, it is widely used as an integral part in cognitive therapies (Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy or MBCT for short). 
With Neuroon Open you can start meditating whenever you feel you need it: at home, at the office or outdoors. The benefits from meditation are visible even after 2 hours of practice. 
 
Neuroon Open meditation feature consists of the three components:  
1. Guided audio meditation sessions. Mindfulness meditation audio sessions will interact with your personal physiology based on brain wave readings and pulse oximetry. For example, when you are calm, you will be guided in a different way than when you are tense and nervous. Guidance will be adjusted to these parameters and will change in the middle of the session if your mood dramatically changes. Neuroon Open is the first device that guides your meditation session based on EEG and pulse oximetry in real time.  
2. Recording option. Neuroon Open will record your EEG readings, movement and pulse, along with any variations in heart rate during each meditation session. You can compare different sessions and see your progress and the influence of external factors on your mood. It’s not only the mind that alters the way your body functions; your body changes your way of thinking, too.  
3. Biofeedback. The Neuroon App gives you the chance to choose which form of feedback you’d prefer and what you’d like from the mask, for example, vibration when dominant brainwaves are alpha or light stimuli while your pulse is raised and unstable. You can customize your biofeedback depending on your needs. It’s all up to you.

Design your perfect wakeup and get energy for the whole day  
You might have noticed that it is much easier to wake up when it’s already after sunrise and sunny outside. When you wake up in very dark room you have many difficulties avoiding sleep inertia and getting out of bed on time.  
Neuroon Open simulates the light of a slowly-breaking dawn so that you wake up the natural way. The sleep tracker eliminates morning grogginess by waking you at the optimal moment.  
When it’s time to wake up, the mask will gradually fill with light that simulates a natural dawn. If you don’t wake up, Neuroon will add gentle vibrations followed by a final audio alarm from your mobile phone.  
 
Neuroon Open allows you to choose out of which phase of sleep you’d like to wake up. For some people the optimal phase to be woken out of is light sleep. For some it’s REM. Using the Neuroon Open app, you will be able to choose. Additionally, while analyzing the EEGs of sleeping people during the product development stage, we discovered that before waking up there is a great deal of what is called “micro wakeups”. We added an option under the “automatic” button an option to be woken up from these micro wakeups.  
You can choose:  
1. If you want to be woken up by light or not  
2. If you want to be woken up using vibration or a ringtone, both or neither  
3. If you want to use smart wakeups, meaning you can pick a time when the mask should start to gently wake you up before the final alarm (as well as the sleep phase you would like to start waking up in).  
 

 Control your home while you sleep  
Have you ever wished your bedroom lighting would automatically turn up when you get out of bed in the middle of the night? Maybe you’d like other adjustments made on your behalf.  
Of course Neuroon won’t clean your apartment for you but it can definitely make your sleep routine easier and help you sleep better.  
So how does it work?  
As has already been noted, Neuroon Open is doing sleep data analysis in real time. All of the recorded signals are forwarded to different algorithms, which can then detect various events. After that those events can be further fed into your home network.  
To begin we plan to integrate Neuroon Open with IFTTT. This is a free web-based service that can be used to create chains of simple conditional statements, called “applets”. Each applet consists of a trigger and an action. We would like to program a few triggers for the mask that can then be integrated with other smart home devices compatible with IFTTT.
Adjust your bedroom to your sleep
 
Triggers that will be implemented for this campaign include:  
1. The moment of falling asleep  
2. REM and NREM detection  
3. Exact wake-up moment, or the moment the mask is removed  
With such triggers it will be possible to:  
- Connect Neuroon Open with your smart hi-fi set and so that the volume is reduced when you fall asleep  
- Connect Neuroon Open with smart lightning in the home, making it shine gradually every time you wake during the night and take off the mask to go to the bathroom  
- Connect Neuroon Open with your Nest and lower the temperature in your room when you enter the REM phase of sleep  
Of course there are a great deal more possibilities for smart home integrations. 
It all depends which IoT devices you use at home. It also depends on the number of triggers we program – but given Neuroon Open is open source, why not to program some useful solutions yourself?
 

We want you to get the most from our work. That’s why we have decided to make out device open-source and share our algorithms. This is what makes Neuroon Open unique.

 
Our product is now transparent, available to the experts who can audit the code and provide constructive feedback as to what we can make better.  
It is verifiable. Researchers using Neuroon for their experiments can see where the results come from and can track the resulting data to electric circuits in the mask.  
It is accessible to DIY and Quantified Self-enthusiasts as it provides SDK and raw data access.  
Its functions may be extended or enhanced with custom apps and tools. With open APIs and data formats, it’s ready for integration with existing and upcoming technologies.  
In an unlikely worst case scenario, if we as a company decided to withdraw our product it could easily be resurrected by a collective of enthusiastic individuals.  
We hope that together we can create a new open standard for exploring and enhancing our minds.  
On the start day of the Kickstarter campaign we will release all of our work-in-progress:  
- Electronic design files  
 - Sources for Neuroon’s firmware  
 - Sleep-staging algorithms  
We encourage everybody to use the materials for both personal and commercial work, so long as the results remain open source.

For our product to be truly successful is to provide a new standard, an open platform for working with your sleep, dreams and meditating mind.
It can only happen with mass adoption and thriving and healthy community around Neuroon Open. The most important part of which, next to the early adopting customers, is the community of developers, makers, FLOSS hackers, diy coders, researchers, etc. Shortly, the people creating new layers of tools and research upon our part of the work.  
Clean and well-documented open-source Software Development Kit  
In order to make it comfortable and rewarding we intend to provide the ever-growing set of clean and extensive documentation and real-life examples of usage of our SDK and other tools.  
Imagine creating your own tools, algorithms and research with scripts as simple as the following conceptual Python snippet:  

Hackathons   
As our code and user base matures, we plan to organize several hackathons around the world to ignite some interesting community projects. The first one is already on the horizon and will take hopefully take place in August this year in Warsaw at Copernicus Science Center!

Here on the campaign we would like to share with you a part of our hardware documentation! We explain there how Neuroon Open measures your forehead temperature, what is the meaning of this temperature and a little bit more technical/ geek details for hackers- measurement method description with the whole analog layout, pin connections and more. 
Please mind that this is just the beginning. We are working really hard to make the whole documentation fully nonconfidential during the campaign!
You can find the documentation here

Neuroon Open App is so called remote controller of Neuroon Open.
If you don’t want to write your own software on Neuroon Open this app will be your very best friend when using Neuroon Open. It will guide you through all the Neuroon Open features, gather your sleep data, show you your sleep score and personalized sleep tips.  
Neuroon Open app is needed to manage your device and trigger different features of the mask. It also controls the mask, analyzes the data coming from the device and present it to you.  
The app works with Iphones and Android phones.  
You can find all* screens of the new app under this link. 
*Please be noted that Meditation and Lucid Dreaming features will be developed after the Kickstarter campaign finish.

Our first Kickstarter campaign took place in December 2013 and lasted one month. During this time 1,944 backers pledged $438,573 to help us bring Neuroon to life. We have reached the goal of the campaign: $ 100 000 within 1 day! Here are the statistics of that campaign: Infographic here During the last 3 years we received a lot of valuable feedback and positive comments from our users.

 

 

We are very thankful to all the backers who supported us at that time. We couldn’t be here today without them, without their belief and patience :) 
Our team has learned a lot through these 3 years. We are aware that we have delivered the product to our backers with a delay so now we have planned everything much better in terms of production and logistics and the whole process with run very smoothly. 
Production of Neuroon Open
This time we won’t spend much time on development because Neuroon Open is pretty much done. It just requires some final polishing and the factory that is based in Poland will start its work in 100%. The most important thing that we learned through the last 4 years was to listen to all the comments and feedback that we have received - the community gave us always lots of energy, great ideas and topics to think about.
Last units of our first product has been shipped to customers.
 

The formal name of our company is Inteliclinic. We are based in San Francisco, California, and Warsaw, Poland. 
In February 2016 we became a member of Sky Deck accelerator organized by one of the most respected universities in the world - the University of California Berkeley in US and member of Pfizer Consumer Healthcare & Galvanize network.  
We are also prizewinners of many prestigious, global competitions for the most innovative new companies eg. first place at the LeWeb contest in Paris in 2013 and first place at the ReleaseIt at SXSW in Austin, TX, the USA in 2016. 

Also the company has been selected as the best sleep startup in 2015 by HealthXL with cooperation with Cleveland Clinic. Inteliclinic was also awarded the Best Health Startup from the Plug and Play accelerator program by Johnson & Johnson and received a $25K award.
 

  
In 2016 Neuroon was featured in the Lufthansa FlyingLab that allowed passengers to test out innovative products in accordance to their ‘Sleep Better’ theme.
In 2017 we received prestigious grant: $1.7mln from the European Commission as part of the Horizon 2020 program for implementing a medical version of Neuroon Open for sleep apnea detection and sleep screening tests.

</div></div>","'Crew''No-Show'We created BeClothed because we wanted to create products that are comfortable, look great and are better for the environment.We believe it is our mission to reinvent the relationship you have with your everyday wear. We do this by making clothing that is not only good for you but for the world too. Our clothes are designed to eliminate odour, thereby requiring you to wash them less often, leading to less wasted water, energy and wear on your clothes.Born out the frustration that our clothes would never be the way we wanted, we set out to disrupt an outdated industry which is focused on planned obsolescence, the practice of intentionally and artificially limiting the useful life of a product for the purpose of driving more sales, something we're completely against.We’re dedicated to crafting high-quality timeless products designed to last (and, hence, reduce waste). Our products are made from some of the best materials and are intentionally designed to last for years.After the overwhelmingly positive response to SilverSocks V1 we’ve been in extensive talks with our factories but most importantly our backers to find out how we can make them even better! We've managed to make several important improvements.An extra 5% of silver has been worked into the SilverSocks design, bumping the silver content up to a massive 30%. Instead of making the silver denser, we’ve totally reformulated the weave. Allowing for the same nylon frame flexibility, whilst spreading the silver out- for more consistent coverage, in turn creating a more evenly spaced silver to cotton ratio, making the supersoft twill even comfier.As if that wasn’t enough the gentle cuff has been rethought too, adding 3% more spandex to allow for extra stretch. The toe has also been strengthened without effecting comfort by meticulously adding a layer of ‘pick’ stitching to the design.How it worksThe Cotton is intertwined with threads of our patented Silver fibers that weave in and out to ensure full coverage.When any part of the Silver touches a bacterial cell, it breaks down its cell wall until the bacteria is no longer able to function, effectively rendering it inactive and unable to produce the pungent smell that comes when it feeds on your sweat.Method of ApplicationOur patented Silver fibers are made from a specialist design allowing them to be woven directly into the fabric. During manufacture, the Cotton fibers are intertwined with our patented Silver fibers to ensure each and every surface is covered. High definition close up of silver-infused yarn Breakdown of Materials  Comfort, Hygiene and VersatilityThe three pillars of everything we make are underscored by comfort, hygiene and versatility. We believe that every single thing you wear should be the best version that exists. Our main focus above all is comfort, because who's going to wear something that doesn't feel great? We try our hardest to give your clothes that extra cosy feel. You can see everything we use in our garments below.Hygiene is the second of our pillars which is a huge part of our culture as many clothes get smelly very easily and need washing after every single wear which ultimately leads to degradation. Our garments don't smell for up to seven days, so you can pack light on that weekend away and come back wearing the clothes you went in (so you've got plenty of space for presents).Last but by no means the least, versatility. We believe everything you buy should withstand everything you do, so whether you're at work, at the gym or even on a hike, all our clothing is made to withstand any environment so you won't need any athletic or smart versions of your clothes to take up more room in your wardrobe. What are 'No-Shows'?Not to be confused with ‘Ankle Socks’. No-Show socks were originally made to act as an additional unseen insole for primitive footwear. Fast-forward; several centuries and here at BeClothed we’ve made these into the best invisible socks out there. Perfect for hiding just below the frame of; loafers, shoes or sneakers. No-show socks provide ultimate comfort and hygiene, particularly in warm climates where Crew or Ankle socks are not appropriate.What are 'Crew' socks?Originating from the standard uniformity ‘Crews’ wore on Naval ships. This type of sock holds perfectly at just below the mid-shin level on our legs. Rather than using outdated suspenders or unforgiving elasticated bands to keep our Crew socks up all day. We use a super-soft woven nylon and spandex cuff, entwined within our twill-weave cotton, to keep circulation and breathability flowing all day long.Origins of CottonGrown from a soft, fluffy boll that's cultivated all over the world - that's even made it to the far side of the moon - cotton is by far one of the oldest and most widespread materials around.Usually planted in the spring, it is a perennial that lives on year after year and keeps growing. With evidence of use in the old world before 5000 BC, it sits firmly near the top of the most resilient fabrics around.What Does It Do?Cotton is super lightweight and durable and as a result, is one of the best base materials there is. The soft-to-the-touch quality ensures comfort and cosiness with every wear.With its roots in the neolithic period, cotton is a reliable, weather-proof insulator that's perfect at any moment and for every occasion.The comfortable yet flexible stretch makes cotton the perfect fabric to use in all garments, along with its hypoallergenic properties that make it a flawless favourite.With the prominently high tensile strength of the twill weave, it's able to withstand multiple washes without a problem.Sustainable FarmingWe only source our cotton from organic crops which haven't been adulterated by genetic modification. This gives an experience as similar to the original cotton that we strive to implement. By cutting out the use of pesticides and other chemicals, we can ensure all our garments are held to a higher standard and free from allergens.We spend on average 70% of our lives with our feet covered, whether we're wearing socks around the home or additionally, shoes outside the home. We live in unnecessary discomfort with socks that don’t work with our feet.SilverSocks provides you with a premium silky feeling on your feet while stopping other irritants like itchy feet. 
 
 For our first major product launch, we chose Indiegogo as the community is both intrigued by new inventions and incredibly useful as a sounding board to help us understand if our ideas would work out.We were picked up by many outlets in the wake of our launch that by the end of it all we had shipped over 10,000+ pairs of our SilverSocks No-Show across all our platforms. This gave us the green light that we were doing something that was in very high demand and we knew we couldn't stop there.With our first product hitting shelves and our team working tirelessly to keep up with orders on our site, we were being asked by thousands of customers if we'd be able to make our socks in a longer crew version that they were more used to. Even with the demand, we had to spend countless months perfecting every single aspect so as to ensure we'd release only the best version before launch day. Again, we were picked up by outlets across the globe and the SilverSocks Crew flew past its goal overnight. By the end of it all, we had shipped over 15,000+ pairs on all our platforms. Right now, at this moment in time, we've sold over 50,000+ pairs to over 160+ countries across the world which is something we wouldn't ever have imagined.It's all thanks to you, our supporters. Thank you.

</div><p><b>Welcome to our Page!</b></p>
<p>Thank you for
visiting our campaign.  Now that we have
your attention, we want to explain what we are doing and why we need your
help.  To give you a little history about
the brand, the company name is LuJeanik and we are based out of the Tampa Bay
area.  Our company was established by its
designer Shanikki Peterson.  Shanikki
always had a dream of becoming a designer since she was young.  She moved all the way from her hometown, Jacksonville,
FL to pursue her career in Fashion Design at the International Academy of
Design in Tampa, FL.  After graduating
she later created her own brand and name it LuJeanik which the name was created
by including her mother's name, her grandmothers name and her name into one.  The name itself represents uniqueness and
three strong fashion forward women.  Since
the establishment of LuJeanik women have appreciated the brand because it
offers sexy yet classy and sophisticated pieces for the mature woman that has a
love for fashion.  To further enhance her
background and to also learn the business side of fashion, Shanikki decided to
enroll in Saint Leo University to obtain an MBA in Marketing.  After working full-time in Corporate America
for nine years at a well known financial institution, being a full-time student
as well as managing and building LuJeanik, Shanikki decided to leave Corporate
America and work full-time on her dream. 
Since working full-time on her dream, the brand has been slowly
progressing but we need your help to put our goals on the frontline.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1171351/files/20150124120850-Marissa4.jpg?1422130130"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/>
<p><b>What We Need</b></p>
<p>We Need
$20,000 for our campaign.  We have so
many projects that we would like to start on immediately, however these
projects have been placed on hold due to lack of funding.  LuJeanik would like to take the brand to a
whole new level.  Currently, all the
pieces we create are designed and personally created by Shanikki.  We would like to build a small team to help
with the production and manufacturing.  We
also need funding to pay for inventory, supplies, a new working location and to

Thank you for
visiting our campaign.  Now that we have
your attention, we want to explain what we are doing and why we need your
help.  To give you a little history about
the brand, the company name is LuJeanik and we are based out of the Tampa Bay
area.  Our company was established by its
designer Shanikki Peterson.  Shanikki
always had a dream of becoming a designer since she was young.  She moved all the way from her hometown, Jacksonville,
FL to pursue her career in Fashion Design at the International Academy of
Design in Tampa, FL.  After graduating
she later created her own brand and name it LuJeanik which the name was created
by including her mother's name, her grandmothers name and her name into one.  The name itself represents uniqueness and
three strong fashion forward women.  Since
the establishment of LuJeanik women have appreciated the brand because it
offers sexy yet classy and sophisticated pieces for the mature woman that has a
love for fashion.  To further enhance her
background and to also learn the business side of fashion, Shanikki decided to
enroll in Saint Leo University to obtain an MBA in Marketing.  After working full-time in Corporate America
for nine years at a well known financial institution, being a full-time student
as well as managing and building LuJeanik, Shanikki decided to leave Corporate
America and work full-time on her dream. 
Since working full-time on her dream, the brand has been slowly
progressing but we need your help to put our goals on the frontline.
What We Need
We Need
$20,000 for our campaign.  We have so
many projects that we would like to start on immediately, however these
projects have been placed on hold due to lack of funding.  LuJeanik would like to take the brand to a
whole new level.  Currently, all the
pieces we create are designed and personally created by Shanikki.  We would like to build a small team to help
with the production and manufacturing.  We
also need funding to pay for inventory, supplies, a new working location and to
pay for marketing strategies to promote the brand.  Shanikki has placed the brand to where it is
at today using her own funds and we are now looking for others to help.  Shanikki's goal is to not only be a fashion
label that is successful but to also help out within the community by helping
others.  Future goals for the brand is to
open a non-profit organization that will empower young women and men by
teaching fashion and finance that will help young entrepreneurs start their own
companies and become successful.   Regardless if we are successful at meeting our
goal or not, please be reassured that the funds we do achieve will be invested

Hello and thank you for checking out my 1956 Ford Fairlane classic car project.   My name is Jason Palermo, and I'm a native Atlantan.   In July 2014, I purchased my first classic car a 1956 Ford Fairlane in Denver, Colorado after a ten year hunt online, and searching in person I found a barn find. 
Over four months I worked on the car turning wrenches trying to get the original 292 engine to start, draining oil which looked like a chocolate milkshake, pulling out spark plugs and draining coolant.   Unfortunately the 292 engine was seized and I am unable to get the engine to start on my own therefore I shipped the car from Denver to Georgia on 10/31/2014  to my mechanic to start the process of an original engine rebuild.

DELIVERY 
We've spent the last year developing the line, and working closely with our production facility to iron out any issues with fit, catch design flaws, and come out with the best product.
The benefit of keeping manufacturing local is that it allows for fast turnaround times. Once the campaign is completed, we will go straight into production, and are planning to ship October, 2015.

<p>Sadly, when his grandfather passed away, he found him self neglecting watches, as it didn’t feel the same without his grandfather.

<p>At that moment, he decided he would start his own brand in the hope to reconnect a love for watches back into the world as it once did. His aim is to provide a neatly designed range of elegant watches at reasonable purchasable prices.

London with its roots and assembly-line in the worlds diamond capital Antwerp,
Belgium. The company was built by jewelry and diamond veterans with over 30
year experience in diamonds and jewelry, who wanted to take jewelry to the
next level.</p>
<p>We developed and patented an innovative way of
fastening diamonds and gems into jewelry. Anyone and everyone can do it, easily
and 100% securely. </p>
<p>This is how it works. A gem or diamond is fastened
into a cartridge-like setting, coined a pYppa. The pYppa fits perfectly into all the
pYppa compatible jewels. The pYppa is protected by US and International Trademarks, Patents and Patent Pending.</p>
<p>Our system consists of three parts:</p>

</div></div>","pYppa is an innovative jewelry company, based in
London with its roots and assembly-line in the worlds diamond capital Antwerp,
Belgium. The company was built by jewelry and diamond veterans with over 30
year experience in diamonds and jewelry, who wanted to take jewelry to the
next level.
We developed and patented an innovative way of
fastening diamonds and gems into jewelry. Anyone and everyone can do it, easily
and 100% securely. 
This is how it works. A gem or diamond is fastened
into a cartridge-like setting, coined a pYppa. The pYppa fits perfectly into all the
pYppa compatible jewels. The pYppa is protected by US and International Trademarks, Patents and Patent Pending.
Our system consists of three parts:


The Jewel.


One or more pYppa (BTW pYppa is both singular and
plural )


Our Tool to fasten and unfasten the pYppa, the
Ykey.





This campaign: Changing Jewelry Forever with the Domin8In this campaign we are introducing both the
concept of interchangeable gems and an innovative, exciting and iconic jewel
especially designed for the pYppa, the Domin8.The Domin8™ is a pendant that looks like a domino with
five and three dots. The eight dots are either white mother of pearl discs or
multi-colored natural gemstones or a combination of both.It's 2"" (5.2mm) high and 1"" (2.6mm) wide and
weighs 1/2 ounce (15gr).
This gorgeous midnight black jewel is made of one of
the lightest yet most resistant metals there is: hard-anodized airplane grade
aluminum 7075. Like the very expensive watches and jewelry pieces, every Domin8
has an engraved serial number.ALL OUR METAL PIECES
Are precision milled on CNCs with tolerances of 0.05mm or 0.002"" 
The black metal is airplane grade aluminum 7075, hard anodiezed
The back of our pYppa is a special stainless steel that is magnetic and chrome plated to last many years 
the springs are tested for at least 30,000 cycles, take out or fasten back in
ALL OUR GEMS:

</div><p>Most people do not know the horrors of human
trafficking. Once I learned about human trafficking and how it affected the
world, I changed the direction of my business.</p><div>
</div><p>My name is Carolyn Bailey founder of Treasure Box Kids and I have been steering my company to become a socially responsible company. I
believe that a for-profit company should also be socially responsible and help
people as much as it reasonably can.  </p><p></p><h4>Treasure Box Kids Mission:</h4><p><b>To offer the highest quality children’s clothing through socially-responsible manufacturing practices.</b></p><div>
</div><p>Treasure Box Kids designs, retails and sub contract manufacturers children's clothing from newborn to size seven. Our product mix consists of unique American-made independent designs as well as imported, designer and embellished children’s clothing. Treasure Box Kids original U.S.A. designs are ethically manufactured in Central Florida. </p><p>We are now embarking in a new direction. We will introduce a new line of children's clothing-Little Maisha. This new line of children's clothing will be manufactured in Kenya by former victims of human trafficking or women who want to educate their children so that they do not become human trafficking victims. </p><p>Maisha means life in Swahili. I named the line Little Maisha because our <b>little clothing will change lives</b>.   </p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1452265447/grxgq5i1hqhzpjnsa3ac.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 620px; height: 468px;""/></p><p></p><h3>Why Kenya?</h3><p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""><b>The International Labor Organization estimates that there are 20.9
million victims of human trafficking globally, with the Kenyan government
consistently ranking toward the bottom half of the U.S. Department of State’s
three-tier human trafficking compliance list, thus making the African country a
severe source, transit, and destination for men, women, and children subjected
to forced labor and sex trafficking.</b></span><br/></p><div>
</div><p>After learning this
information and more about what is happening in Kenya, I felt compelled to launch an effort through Treasure Box Kids to
help educate, employ, and ultimately prevent Kenyan women from becoming victims
of human trafficking. This is why I created the <b>Little Maisha Line</b> of children's clothing.  <b>Your support is needed to jumpstart this endeavor.</b></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1452265391/vf4bbndh4flu1zuxinfe.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>If you would like to reach us, feel free to email us at <b>contactus@treasureboxkids.com</b>. We would love to hear from you and answer your questions!</p><p>Thank you!</p><p></p><h3>The Impact</h3><p><b>Education and Economic development are the two keys to preventing Human Trafficking.</b>  If woman are working they can help their families. Women in Kenya are eagerly waiting for the completion of this campaign. They know that they will start to be able to rebuild their lives economically and be given the opportunity of educating their children. A partnership with an American company to produce a line of clothing will change their situation from one without hope to a situation for themselves and their children that is now filled with hope.  </p><p><b>A successful campaign will start to give hope to people that have not seen any hope for a better future.</b> </p><p>The success of this project and campaign will also help our own domestic Human Trafficking victims. Treasure Box Kids will start to employ former victims in our administrative office. We have future plans to open a fashion production house in Central Florida in  2016 and employ former victims in an ethical and emotionally supportive environment.  </p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1452265033/ohjn7tqe66azydsqdgx4.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 30px; background-color: initial;"">What We Need &amp; What You Get</span></p><h4>Campaign Goal-$20,000</h4><ul>

Most people do not know the horrors of human
trafficking. Once I learned about human trafficking and how it affected the
world, I changed the direction of my business.
My name is Carolyn Bailey founder of Treasure Box Kids and I have been steering my company to become a socially responsible company. I
believe that a for-profit company should also be socially responsible and help
people as much as it reasonably can.  Treasure Box Kids Mission:To offer the highest quality children’s clothing through socially-responsible manufacturing practices.
Treasure Box Kids designs, retails and sub contract manufacturers children's clothing from newborn to size seven. Our product mix consists of unique American-made independent designs as well as imported, designer and embellished children’s clothing. Treasure Box Kids original U.S.A. designs are ethically manufactured in Central Florida. We are now embarking in a new direction. We will introduce a new line of children's clothing-Little Maisha. This new line of children's clothing will be manufactured in Kenya by former victims of human trafficking or women who want to educate their children so that they do not become human trafficking victims. Maisha means life in Swahili. I named the line Little Maisha because our little clothing will change lives.   Why Kenya?The International Labor Organization estimates that there are 20.9
million victims of human trafficking globally, with the Kenyan government
consistently ranking toward the bottom half of the U.S. Department of State’s
three-tier human trafficking compliance list, thus making the African country a
severe source, transit, and destination for men, women, and children subjected
to forced labor and sex trafficking.
After learning this
information and more about what is happening in Kenya, I felt compelled to launch an effort through Treasure Box Kids to
help educate, employ, and ultimately prevent Kenyan women from becoming victims
of human trafficking. This is why I created the Little Maisha Line of children's clothing.  Your support is needed to jumpstart this endeavor.If you would like to reach us, feel free to email us at contactus@treasureboxkids.com. We would love to hear from you and answer your questions!Thank you!The ImpactEducation and Economic development are the two keys to preventing Human Trafficking.  If woman are working they can help their families. Women in Kenya are eagerly waiting for the completion of this campaign. They know that they will start to be able to rebuild their lives economically and be given the opportunity of educating their children. A partnership with an American company to produce a line of clothing will change their situation from one without hope to a situation for themselves and their children that is now filled with hope.  A successful campaign will start to give hope to people that have not seen any hope for a better future. The success of this project and campaign will also help our own domestic Human Trafficking victims. Treasure Box Kids will start to employ former victims in our administrative office. We have future plans to open a fashion production house in Central Florida in  2016 and employ former victims in an ethical and emotionally supportive environment.  What We Need & What You GetCampaign Goal-$20,000
We will start production of the Little Maisha line
The first production run will include the eight offered rewards 
Several women will obtain new work 
If We Exceed Our Goal-
 We can include a larger line of girls clothing 
 Expand the line to include a complete boys line (there is currently only one  style that will be produced as a reward) 
 More Women will be employed
 Hire additional USA staff to market the expanded line

If we do not meet and/or exceed our goal we will still start to manufacture in Kenya. It will still include the eight designs but it will be a smaller production run and it will not help put as many women to work as a full line of both boys and girls clothing. If we exceed our goal and manufacture two complete lines we can help more women. This is a breakdown of how the funds will be utilized.
Project TimelineThis project will be completed and rewards shipped by the end of June 2016. We are adding in additional time to deliver rewards as there can be complications with overseas deliveries. We do anticipate shipping in earlier in May 2016. Rewards:The initial Little Maisha Line will consist of these Eight Styles and One Infinity Scarf.We included a Infinity Scarf as a reward, available in Women's and Child sizes. Great as a gift to support the campaign.                          Our outfit styles are available in size 12 Months to size 6 in girls- 12 Months to size 4 Toddler in Boys.At the end of the campaign you will be sent a style selection sheet to choose your exact style and size. Pre Ordering during the campaign will save you money as these designs will retail higher after the campaign ends.

<p><b>ABOUT ME:</b></p>
<p>Hi everyone! I’m Anthony and welcome to the <b>Bed Threads</b> post startup campaign! A
little about myself, I come from a family of five. I was born in Hawaii and
moved around because my dad is a former Marine. He served 32 years. I grew up playing video games,
watching cartoons and movies, and playing sports. I’m a huge Call of Duty fan.
I graduated high school in New Orleans and soon after joined the service like
my dad. I did two tours in Iraq and now have two children that I love
unconditionally. </p>
<p><b>CAMPAIGN SUMMARY:</b></p>
<p><b>Bed Threads</b> will
be the first store geared towards the big kids in all of us!</p>
<p>I think it would be cool for someone to come home from work
and change into their favorite Avengers pajama pants or for a guy to watch his
girlfriend walk out of the bedroom with her Batman pajama pants and bra on and
sit next to him on the couch.  It’s just
another way to express “them” in a fun relative way with each other. </p>
<p>Thing is, we know that we aren’t not the only people to
think like this. But we know it’s hard to find everything a person would need
all in one place. So we wanted to bring to everyone a place where they could
find the latest, fashionable, but affordable lingerie and pajamas all in one
setting. Theme based from movies, cartoons, and comic books, these products
will never allow room for a dull moment. </p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1449583890/tggr3977cr5ml00v6vdh.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><b><br/></b></p><p><b>WHAT WE NEED &amp;

<p><b>SOCIAL IMPACT/VALUE:</b></p>
<p>We know that women love to be sexy and that men love to look

</div></div>","Veza
is a unique line of 12 fashion and sport wristbands.
We have taken the traditional plastic wristband and given it an upgrade, both
in the look and the charitable aspect. The Veza wristband has a leathery feel,
an embossed Veza logo and an innovative design. And the Veza wristband is the
first of its kind with a seamless lip that gracefully sits on your wrist.
Veza
wristbands are stylish, sporty and fun for men, women and teens. Each Veza
color is partnered with a different world-renowned charity organization (see
all wristbands & their partnered charities below). Your support helps build awareness for the charity and provides a portion of proceeds to the cause. Wear the color
you like, or support the cause you feel connected to.



CHARITIES:

Each wristband color supports a different charity.
When you wear the wristband of the charity you support, not only are you
wearing a stylish bracelet but you are also helping build awareness for the
cause.
Below are the 12 Veza wristband colors
and the charities that are supported by each wristband:






CHOOSE A COLOR. CHOOSE A CAUSE.

Each Veza wristband color is partnered
with a different cause. No two causes are the same and each partnership
directly impacts people in need throughout the United States and Worldwide.

You as the shopper can choose either
the wristband color you like, or the cause that you want to help support. With
a variety of causes to choose from -- like hunger, orphans, crisis aid, and
more -- the choice is yours. And you get to show your support in fashionable
and fun way.

<div>I apologise for the cheesy video but hopefully it will tell you a bit about how this whole business began as Scarletts Vintage Attire (now Oh So Scarletts) over 4 years ago. I am 21 years old and live in Cornwall,  anyone who has ever been to cornwall will know it's very quiet and thus small businesses struggle, so here is the plan. I am moving to Brighton! My campaign is to ask all you lovely people to help us make the big move and open a fabulous handmade clothing shop were customers can walk in and see clothing made before their very eyes. If my funding is completed then I will be able to rent a shop for 3 months, kit it out and start my dream of making pretty things for a living.</div>
<div><br/></div>
</div><div>
<div>The £20,000 sounds like a lot and it honestly is and it's impossible to get that sort of money without selling a kidney on ebay. The money will cover 3 months rent in Brighton with a little extra to buy rails, decoration and flyers for promotion so we can continue to grow after this venture. By investing in this you will get to watch the transition take place, receive a handmade headscarf and an invitation to the launch event where I can personally thankyou for all your support! </div>
<div>If we do not reach the entire goal the money will be saved up for the day when we can afford the move so it will go towards a shop as I am determined to make this happen! However if we only get £100 we would put it towards advertising in the hope that sales will drive us closer to the dream.</div>
</div><div><br/></div><div>
<div>It's important to support independent business because each one has something unique and special to give, with everything being handmade every item we make is unique and with the ability for people to watch this process while shopping, is rare!</div>
<div>In previous years I have travelled to London and back in a day to sell in the big city and I have always made profit at these events however with a part time job to support myself I have been unable to gather enough money at one off events to really make the business thrive. If I get the right money I will be able to open a shop and support myself on wages as the business begins to fully fund itself.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>With every venture there are risks, and uprooting my life to open a shop is a mighty big risk however after 4 years I am ready. Being a manager in a store for others I have the ability to promote and push the business enough to make the move permanent and the business thrive enabling it to fund itself and then me.</div>
<div>I have accommodation for the months I will be in shop until I am satisfied with the growth of the business and the determination to make it happen.</div> <p><br/></p>
<p>If you are as excited as I am for this venture please donate as much as you can, however if you are unable to donate it doesn't mean you can't help Oh So Scarletts grow, share this campaign,  get tweeting, make some noise and like our social pages! Even talking can set the ball in motion! </p>

<br/>
<b></b><p></p>
<p><b>Introduction</b> <br/></p>
<p>Since the foundation of our label <a href=""https://www.indiegogo.com/campaigns/howl-by-maria-gluck-high-end-sustainable-fashion/edit/www.howlhowlhowl.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">H O W L by Maria Glück</a> in 2013, our
      collections
      and designs are driven by the idea to bring ethical and sustainable      fashion not just  into
      <a href=""http://presshowl.tumblr.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">magazines</a> and fashion weeks, but into
      our wardrobes.
      </p>
<p>We love fashion and we love people, and this is exactly why we believe the production process to
        be as
        important as any other side of the fashion industry. Incidents like in Rana Plaza are only the peak of the iceberg. While fast fashion in the sphere of production proves to be unsustainable, in the sphere of consumption it leaves us with meaningless and repetitive commodities. Fashion garments no longer have a value based on the design, the craft, the fabric quality or the producers' work.  <br/></p>
<p>For us, employing sustainable, organic, ethical,
          recycled and
          waste reducing sources in the production is essential. It is part of
        how we want to live. It's our lifestyle. 
We
are very excited to see our <span>movement growing. More and more conscious
and reflected people are looking for a big change in fashion. </span></p>
<p>Some of our designs are intended for fashion runways, shows
      or photos. However, our passion and aim are to create for people
      who simply love
      and wear our clothes. This is why we want to get closer with you. Learn how we work, and
      tell us what
      you love. Let’s work together on the future of fashion. Now.<br/></p>

<b>What is
our next challenge?</b><span><br/><br/></span><p><span>

We
are looking forward to designing the <b><i>SS 16 collection</i></b> with much
excitement. We plan to explore historical weaving looms<span> in rural Spain where local artisans
still handcraft beautiful
woven fabrics employing old techniques. In cooperation with them, we will create beautiful patterns and <span>unique </span> textiles. </span></span></p>
<p><span><span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>By doing so, we prevent the loss of these traditions and we support local and peripheral economies. For us,
that’s not just a matter of respect. We actually enjoy the social, cultural and
artistic challenges coming with the encounter, and
we incorporate those challenges in our designs.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>We will regularly update our findings and the development of our sourcing on our blog. Our Spring/Summer 16 collection will be finally presented in September or October 2015 in the frame of an international </span>fashion week.</span></p>
<p><span></span></p>

<br/>
<p><b>Why do we need your help?</b></p>
<p>As much as we love to put <span>all our efforts into the research of sourcing, into a reflected
design or a sustainable production – it all creates high costs. </span><span>Product research, traveling
to find traditional and sustainable producers, prototyping, samples, colors,
lookbooks, photo shootings, web design, showroom, and collection's presentation. <br/></span></p>
<p>That’s why we decided to reach out for your help, so that we can continue to
go further and make sustainability in fashion real. </p>

</div></div>","Introduction 
Since the foundation of our label H O W L by Maria Glück in 2013, our
      collections
      and designs are driven by the idea to bring ethical and sustainable      fashion not just  into
      magazines and fashion weeks, but into
      our wardrobes.
      
We love fashion and we love people, and this is exactly why we believe the production process to
        be as
        important as any other side of the fashion industry. Incidents like in Rana Plaza are only the peak of the iceberg. While fast fashion in the sphere of production proves to be unsustainable, in the sphere of consumption it leaves us with meaningless and repetitive commodities. Fashion garments no longer have a value based on the design, the craft, the fabric quality or the producers' work.  
For us, employing sustainable, organic, ethical,
          recycled and
          waste reducing sources in the production is essential. It is part of
        how we want to live. It's our lifestyle. 
We
are very excited to see our movement growing. More and more conscious
and reflected people are looking for a big change in fashion. 
Some of our designs are intended for fashion runways, shows
      or photos. However, our passion and aim are to create for people
      who simply love
      and wear our clothes. This is why we want to get closer with you. Learn how we work, and
      tell us what
      you love. Let’s work together on the future of fashion. Now.





What is H O W L  by Maria Glück?

Maria Glück founded the Berlin based label
        H O W L in 2013. 
      
H O W L  by Maria Glück creates sustainable high end fashion
        for men, women
        and unisex with a minimal style. 
      
      
Our production is local and regional 
(Berlin-area
and various regions of
Spain) and sustainable, respecting all social standards and labor rights.
H O W L by Maria Glück has been featured by fashion magazines like VOGUE, Factice, OZON, FuckingYoung,
      Protein, Eluxe, Chasseur or Œ Magazine.
H O W L by Maria Glück has presented collections in Berlin
          Fashion Week        (SS 14), Mercedes Benz Fashion Week Madrid (FW 14), Paris Fashion Week, London Fashion Week (FW15) and Fashionclash.
        In 2014, Maria Glück was a finalist of The Future Of Fashion
        program organized
        by Not Just A Label and Who's Next Paris. In
        September 2014, she was featured as one of the 200 world’s top talents
        byVogue Italia.
      
        In February 2015, Maria Glück took part in the International
          Fashion Showcase at London Fashion Week organized by the British Fashion Council.




What is
our next challenge?

We
are looking forward to designing the SS 16 collection with much
excitement. We plan to explore historical weaving looms in rural Spain where local artisans
still handcraft beautiful
woven fabrics employing old techniques. In cooperation with them, we will create beautiful patterns and unique  textiles. 

By doing so, we prevent the loss of these traditions and we support local and peripheral economies. For us,
that’s not just a matter of respect. We actually enjoy the social, cultural and
artistic challenges coming with the encounter, and
we incorporate those challenges in our designs.

We will regularly update our findings and the development of our sourcing on our blog. Our Spring/Summer 16 collection will be finally presented in September or October 2015 in the frame of an international fashion week.









Why do we need your help?
As much as we love to put all our efforts into the research of sourcing, into a reflected
design or a sustainable production – it all creates high costs. Product research, traveling
to find traditional and sustainable producers, prototyping, samples, colors,
lookbooks, photo shootings, web design, showroom, and collection's presentation. 
That’s why we decided to reach out for your help, so that we can continue to
go further and make sustainability in fashion real. 



You could support this crowdfunding campaign for our collection's project.
 We aim to raise $ 10,000 to support the funding. We offer exciting and 
exclusive rewards in exchange for your support. Donate, spread the word,
 connect, and join in! We also welcome any ethical and sustainable 
sponsor.

</p>
<p>QUESTION: How do you provide thousands of jobs of all types?
Affordable, low cost housing for tens of thousands of residents, generate no
energy bills, create a cleaner environment, and get paid to do it!?!?</p>
<p>ANSWER: It begins with the Deep Green Tech
Accelerator.</p>
<p>The things that cause high electric, water, and gas prices
at home also impact your health and lifestyle.</p>
<p>The Deep Green Tech Accelerator will improve the performance
and availability of energy independent solutions, buildings, and products by
providing facilities and programs that allow residents to interact, learn, and
innovate alongside the Corporate, Government, Academic organizations, and
Utility Providers.</p>
<p>Tom Bray and Jim Schemmel began working together in 2004
to develop the greenest community in America. 
Before Tom passed, his sons Matt and Marcus joined the team to add new
focus and their business, marketing and finance backgrounds.</p> </div> <div> </div><h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3><div> </div><p></p><div>
</div><p>Jobs, careers, entrepreneurial opportunities and Homes are
created when we move to energy independent solutions and build or update buildings
and housing with layouts and designs that use their current environment to its
benefit and include affordable smart technology that is available to everyone. </p><div>
</div><p>A ‘Living Laboratory’ community will be built first as part
of the Deep Green Tech Accelerator, then duplicated with lower costs in other
cities and states.  </p><div>
</div><p>The energy saved will be in such great quantities in each community that you can sell some of it back to your utility provider, and you will receive an energy
check instead of a bill each month.</p><p>What the campaign will cover:</p><div>

QUESTION: How do you provide thousands of jobs of all types?
Affordable, low cost housing for tens of thousands of residents, generate no
energy bills, create a cleaner environment, and get paid to do it!?!?
ANSWER: It begins with the Deep Green Tech
Accelerator.
The things that cause high electric, water, and gas prices
at home also impact your health and lifestyle.
The Deep Green Tech Accelerator will improve the performance
and availability of energy independent solutions, buildings, and products by
providing facilities and programs that allow residents to interact, learn, and
innovate alongside the Corporate, Government, Academic organizations, and
Utility Providers.
Tom Bray and Jim Schemmel began working together in 2004
to develop the greenest community in America. 
Before Tom passed, his sons Matt and Marcus joined the team to add new
focus and their business, marketing and finance backgrounds.   What We Need & What You Get 
Jobs, careers, entrepreneurial opportunities and Homes are
created when we move to energy independent solutions and build or update buildings
and housing with layouts and designs that use their current environment to its
benefit and include affordable smart technology that is available to everyone. 
A ‘Living Laboratory’ community will be built first as part
of the Deep Green Tech Accelerator, then duplicated with lower costs in other
cities and states.  
The energy saved will be in such great quantities in each community that you can sell some of it back to your utility provider, and you will receive an energy
check instead of a bill each month.What the campaign will cover:

Help us build the first Deep Green Tech Accelerator and the
model for creating jobs, and low cost affordable smart housing, with no energy
bills.  
So that we can all have a cleaner environment and get paid
doing it in the ‘living laboratory’ and in your community.   Risks & Challenges We have a developed plan, Corporate, Government, Academic
organizations and Utility Providers ready to go.  But, when the financial crisis hit in 2008
operations were put on hold, until recently. 

We now have a location that has the diversity of terrain needed
to test many different solutions and methods required to reduce costs as much
as possible and it is conveniently located by many of the resources needed.  


Now is the time, and the team is ready to go again with your
help and support.
 We will share regular updates on the progress of the Deep Green Tech Accelerator.
Some perks will include 'interactive membership' on planning for Tech Accelerator projects.    Other Ways You Can Help So you can't contribute, that doesn't mean they can't help:  Help get the word out and make some noise about this campaign.

The wood qualities come from all over the world making it international and approachable. Every wood has its own spirit. The specific design of a banana shape demands a very skilled craftsman to process it.

Great day with BETH STERN as we donated 500 blankets to North Shore Animal League America . She really showed tremendous support for our efforts here at Kona Benellie Designs - Creators of the Throwbee which inspires us to do even more.

us warm front and back while leaving our hands free. There was nothing out there like it. The

matches each customer purchase with a new blanket given a shelter dog in need.

<br/>
<h4>What makes the OART-Tee different?</h4>
<br/>
<p><b>Uniqueness</b><br/>
Every OART-Tee is a work of art and one of a kind in the world. You can choose the artwork you want, and can fully customize both the front and the back of your personal tee. You can expand, reduce and move the artwork around the tee, so that you get a great looking tee exactly the way you like it.
</p>
<p><b>Premium Quality</b><br/>
We use only premium quality 100% soft luxurious cotton which lasts longer and can reproduce the artwork properly. Oh, and we use NO harmful chemicals and NO dye sublimation printing!
</p>
<p><b>Social Equality</b><br/>
Over 99% of all T-shirts and T-shirt blanks in the world are mass-produced. Unfortunately, some of these tees are produced in sweatshops; where poor and uneducated workers slaved away in unbelievable working conditions to produce low-quality and low-cost tees. We do not mass-produce (but employ and properly compensate) skilled workers to customize the production of every single tee.
</p>
<br/>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1427661/files/20150429215340-MandieManzano.jpg?1430369620"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/>
<p><b>High-End Production</b><br/>
Most screen, digital and dye sublimation printing are done on a mass factory-produced t-shirt blanks, with severe limitations on high-resolution all over  printing. Our production methodology ensures a high-resolution, digital quality image that does not fade - even after many washes, and we use environmentally friendly dyes.
</p>
<p><b>Support the Artistic Community</b><br/>
Each OART-Tee is a work of art, literally! We have a very talented global artists and designers in our community who have uploaded well over 15,000 pieces of original artwork and designs, for you to choose for your tee that will delight, mesmerize and wow you!
</p>
<p><b>Customization</b><br/>
Unlike mass-produced tees that you can get in department stores or even on some very high-end boutiques, we can confidently guarantee you that each OART-Tee will be different due to its unique production, customization and individualized tailoring.
</p>
<p><b>All-Over Printing</b><br/>
The world's first integrated sleeves, showing the ENTIRE artwork; one of the challenges wit all-over printing on cotton is that the different printed images on the front, back and sleeves will shrink unevenly during the color fixation and steam cleaning stage.
</p>
<br/><br/>
<p>Our newly designed Integrated Sleeves (no seams!) allows the artwork and design to be clearly displayed on both the front and the back of the tee in one great looking, unbroken and continuous image.</p>
<p>THE RESULT... you own a super unique OART-Tee you love and it is guaranteed to be one of a kind in the world!</p>
<p>Immerse yourself into the creative process and unleash your artistic genius today!</p>
<p>YAY! Kick A@@!</p>

<h3 style=""color: #7c148b; font-size: 25px;"">The OART-Tee Difference </h3>
<p>Why pay good money to look like everyone else?</p>
<p>Every single OART-Tee is a work of art and simply one of a kind in the world.</p>
<p>Unlike mass produced tees that you can get in department stores or even very high-end boutiques, we can confidently guarantee that each OART-Tee will be different due to its unique production, customization and individualized tailoring.</p>
<p>Even if two OART-Tees were designed with exactly the same look and size, there will be subtle differences. Like twins, they may look somewhat similar, but each OART-Tee will be special and distinctive in its own right.</p>
<p>You will never have the embarrassment of seeing someone else wearing an exact duplicate of your OART-Tee on Planet Earth, GUARANTEED!</p>
<p>Oh, 100% soft luxurious cotton, NO harmful chemicals and NO dye sublimation printing!</p>
<p>  A Necessary Luxury!

<p style=""color: #111111; font-size: 15px;"">When Vincent discovered “all over printing” in 2012, he saw the possibilities of wearable art providing an opportunity to unify artists globally, give them hope for a future, let them run their own business and provide an international platform to share their creation.</p>
<p style=""color: #111111; font-size: 15px;"">The “all over printed” technology was very new back then and only a few companies were offering dye sublimation printing on blank polyester t-shirts.</p>
<p style=""color: #111111; font-size: 15px;"">Vincent decided to buy some dye sublimated printed t-shirts for himself. He quickly discovered that although they looked good on the surface, there were significant quality flaws and found many people preferring cotton to polyester.</p>
<p style=""color: #111111; font-size: 15px;"">He strongly believed that an artist will not create a masterpiece of their work on a cheap medium; hence he sourced the best quality cotton medium and the best and most vibrant inks for artists to showcase their work on.</p>
<p style=""color: #111111; font-size: 15px;"">Together with a business partner in Europe, Vincent co-developed a new production process, and together they created the OART-Tee.</p>

</div></div>","CUSTOMIZE YOUR OWN TEE AND SUPPORT THE ARTISTIC COMMUNITY


Are you tired of wearing the same mass-produced tee like everyone else in the public?

Are you unhappy with uncomfortable, common and boring tees that don't last long or the colors fade only after a few washes?

Are you fed up with stores giving you fixed designs and absolutely no other choices to express who you really are?

Have you ever bought a custom-printed polyester tee only to receive a product with printing flaws and imperfections?

The OART-Tee (Original Art Tee) can be customized to your own design, doesn't fade, is premium quality, and is made by properly compensated workers. 
By choosing your own tee design, you are also helping supporting emerging artists.

A collection of amazing and eye-popping designs by our artists.


Over 10,000 other amazing artist-inspired designs you can check out, customize and own today!

THE OART-TEE   A Fusion of Art, Design and Fashion


What makes the OART-Tee different?

Uniqueness
Every OART-Tee is a work of art and one of a kind in the world. You can choose the artwork you want, and can fully customize both the front and the back of your personal tee. You can expand, reduce and move the artwork around the tee, so that you get a great looking tee exactly the way you like it.

Premium Quality
We use only premium quality 100% soft luxurious cotton which lasts longer and can reproduce the artwork properly. Oh, and we use NO harmful chemicals and NO dye sublimation printing!

Social Equality
Over 99% of all T-shirts and T-shirt blanks in the world are mass-produced. Unfortunately, some of these tees are produced in sweatshops; where poor and uneducated workers slaved away in unbelievable working conditions to produce low-quality and low-cost tees. We do not mass-produce (but employ and properly compensate) skilled workers to customize the production of every single tee.




High-End Production
Most screen, digital and dye sublimation printing are done on a mass factory-produced t-shirt blanks, with severe limitations on high-resolution all over  printing. Our production methodology ensures a high-resolution, digital quality image that does not fade - even after many washes, and we use environmentally friendly dyes.

Support the Artistic Community
Each OART-Tee is a work of art, literally! We have a very talented global artists and designers in our community who have uploaded well over 15,000 pieces of original artwork and designs, for you to choose for your tee that will delight, mesmerize and wow you!

Customization
Unlike mass-produced tees that you can get in department stores or even on some very high-end boutiques, we can confidently guarantee you that each OART-Tee will be different due to its unique production, customization and individualized tailoring.

All-Over Printing
The world's first integrated sleeves, showing the ENTIRE artwork; one of the challenges wit all-over printing on cotton is that the different printed images on the front, back and sleeves will shrink unevenly during the color fixation and steam cleaning stage.


Our newly designed Integrated Sleeves (no seams!) allows the artwork and design to be clearly displayed on both the front and the back of the tee in one great looking, unbroken and continuous image.
THE RESULT... you own a super unique OART-Tee you love and it is guaranteed to be one of a kind in the world!
Immerse yourself into the creative process and unleash your artistic genius today!
YAY! Kick A@@!










Fashionable and Trendy
Make your personal art fashion statement today!



Having Fun and Looking Cool

Accessorize and Look Even Cooler
Accessorize with your favorite gear and look even better!





The OART-Tee Difference 
Why pay good money to look like everyone else?
Every single OART-Tee is a work of art and simply one of a kind in the world.
Unlike mass produced tees that you can get in department stores or even very high-end boutiques, we can confidently guarantee that each OART-Tee will be different due to its unique production, customization and individualized tailoring.
Even if two OART-Tees were designed with exactly the same look and size, there will be subtle differences. Like twins, they may look somewhat similar, but each OART-Tee will be special and distinctive in its own right.
You will never have the embarrassment of seeing someone else wearing an exact duplicate of your OART-Tee on Planet Earth, GUARANTEED!
Oh, 100% soft luxurious cotton, NO harmful chemicals and NO dye sublimation printing!
  A Necessary Luxury!

Vincent has a deep love and appreciation for all types of art. He loves the creative energy that goes into a piece of original art, where an idea is lovingly transformed into reality.
Vincent first learned about the personal challenges, the years of sacrifices and the tough challenges and struggles faced by many new artists; when he first met and spoke with his wife’s uncle, AH TEE ANG.
Ang is a renowned national artist in Singapore and is a highly decorated recipient of the Cultural Medallion award, the highest accolade awarded for artistic excellence in Singapore. His work is widely recognized, sold at Christies Auctions and proudly displayed at the United Nations, the Singapore Changi Airport, hotel chains and in the private collection of the Sultan of Brunei.

When Vincent discovered “all over printing” in 2012, he saw the possibilities of wearable art providing an opportunity to unify artists globally, give them hope for a future, let them run their own business and provide an international platform to share their creation.
The “all over printed” technology was very new back then and only a few companies were offering dye sublimation printing on blank polyester t-shirts.
Vincent decided to buy some dye sublimated printed t-shirts for himself. He quickly discovered that although they looked good on the surface, there were significant quality flaws and found many people preferring cotton to polyester.
He strongly believed that an artist will not create a masterpiece of their work on a cheap medium; hence he sourced the best quality cotton medium and the best and most vibrant inks for artists to showcase their work on.
Together with a business partner in Europe, Vincent co-developed a new production process, and together they created the OART-Tee.",58.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Hi there! I'm Shivani, the founder of Arture. Like most great things, Arture started out of a flash of inspiration - a light bulb moment! I was aching to create products that would be luxurious, while being harmless to our world at the same time. And just like that, Arture was born.</p>
<p>Arture is about art and nature uniting as one. Nature holds within it so many beautiful secrets and Arture is on a mission to rediscover those secrets and bring them to you. The world around me never stops surprising me, and Arture is my <b>canvas of nature</b>! </p>

<p><b>ABOUT ME…</b></p>

Hi guys!  My name is Kellia
Reed and I am a graphic artist &amp; computer illustrator from New Jersey.  I am very passionate about all genres of art especially
graphic design, anime, and manga art culture. 
In result, I love creating urban
themed graphic and anime inspired illustrations combining my hand drawing skill
and computer drawing programs.  I also have
a freelance graphic illustration and design business in which I assist and
advise my clients on how to create their own creative works.

<p>I am also a single mom to an amazing 3 year old son, Kaden.  Recently, my son and I were involved in a serious
car accident in which timing and what I believe was God’s protection pretty
much saved our lives; still I got banged up pretty bad. I experienced how life literally can be taken
away in just a moment and realized that there is no time like the present to
accomplish whatever it is that I want to do. 
My ambition is to share my art with the world so I created a logo,
converted my artwork into graphics, and decided to start a wearable art collection.</p>
<p><b>THE DOPE
MOVEMENT…</b></p>
<p>DEFINED DOPENESS will be a unisex apparel collection in
which I plan on using apparel pieces as the canvas for my artwork.  Instead of just selling print work or using
fine art materials as a medium, why not utilize something that everyone needs
and can use and reuse?  I see apparel as
a moving canvas.  Most works of art are
placed somewhere stationary and I don’t want that.  I want my artwork to be seen as much as it
can be.  The complexity of the each
illustration and printing style will all depend on how much money I can
contribute to each design for production. 
First production will consist of just t-shirts based on my main logo (to
get the brand out) and a couple of my anime illustrations utilizing different
printing and ink techniques. The goal is
to release a new piece every 3-6 months. 
As my funds grow, ultimately I would like to branch out into fleece
goods and more cut &amp; sewn pieces along with different types of trim such as
appliques, embroidery, custom woven labels, etc.  I also plan on using social media as sort of
a lifestyle platform in which I will assist my customers on how to coordinate
my apparel pieces with other articles of clothing they may already have or are
looking to purchase.</p>
<p><b>HOW YOU MAY
HELP…</b></p>
<p>Here is where I need your help. Humbly I am asking for your
generosity to help me raise $5,000 to complete my first production.  Below is the breakdown on how I plan to use
all funds raised:</p>
<p><b><u>LEGAL + BUSINESS
CARDS</u></b></p>
<p>First and foremost, approximately
15% of proposed funding will be used for legal purposes to register or trademark
my logo.  The last thing I ever want, as
any artist can agree with, is for someone to see my work and try to copy my
ideas. Therefore I must protect myself
and already have a business lawyer to do so. 
Once my logo is in the works to be legalized, I plan on printing new
business cards.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1442886797/baba1kcyvzjwgohjwh2t.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><b><u><br/></u></b></p><p><b><u>WHOLESALE + PRODUCTION
+ PACKAGING + DISTRIBUTION + PROMOTION</u></b></p>
<p>The remaining 85% of funds will be
divided between purchasing wholesale t-shirts, ink, outsourced printing, production,
packaging, distribution, and promotion.  For
my basic logo t-shirts, I plan on doing the printing myself at a local print
shop, Newark Print Shop, which is why I would need to purchase ink.  But I also want to explore as many printing
techniques as I can which is why I will be using additional printing services.  The more detailed oriented illustrations and
printing techniques I can produce, the better for my vision.  I plan on selling my first collection
personally, through social media utilizing PayPal or cash, the Etsy website, and
bigcartel.com. Each purchase will be
wrapped and fastened with a custom DEFINED DOPENESS sticker that I will also
print myself.  With each purchase I plan
on including a personalized invoice, and a small card with my logo and a
personal thank you to each customer.  As
my funds grow, the ultimate goal is to build a DEFINED DOPENESS cut &amp; sewn apparel
line and lifestyle brand.</p><p><br/></p>
<p>If I do not raise the
proposed amount of $5000, I will use the funds I do receive to produce as much
as I can. I still plan on legalizing my
logo first because I feel that is most important and I will then take it step
by step until I reach my goals.</p><p><br/></p>

<p><b><br/></b></p><p><b>THE IMPACT
OF YOUR GENEROSITY…</b></p>
<p>Honestly, I
just cannot do this alone.  My life does
not afford me the extra funds to get my goals to the next level, especially
being a single mom with other financial responsibilities, mostly repaying
student loans.  It really is that challenging
but I want the opportunity to share my art in my own way. I want the freedom to
be an entrepreneur, work on my own time and most importantly to have more time
with my son.  I know I have the talent to
be successful; I have been sharing my artwork through print since 2009 and
people have really responded positively and have always inquired if I were
going to start a t-shirt collection or sell my prints.  So not only is this for me but for those who
have supported me all these years.  The
same people who trust me to help them with their own creative projects.  For example, I have been working with a
non-profit and one t-shirt I designed for Cancer awareness has raised over
$6.5k to date.  I am also a graphic
designer by day and have been creating licensed artwork for major sports leagues
for 3 years now.</p>
<p>I am also a firm believer of giving back to the community.  From every purchase, I plan to donate 10% to Fashion
For A Cure (FFAC), <a href=""http://www.fashionforacure.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><u>www.fashionforacure.org</u></a>
, a non-profit organization I support which uses fashion to help raise money to
increase education and support for families affected by Heart Disease and
Cancer and is also a platform intended to motivate people to give back to their
communities.</p>
<p><b>THE
CHALLENGES…</b></p>
<p>Of course with starting any new business venture, especially
a creative one, there will be risks.  Printing
and production could not be as per my standards and I have to reprint, the
apparel could not sell as well as I would hope, or I just run out of money and
cannot move forward in the direction I’d like. 
One of my biggest personal challenges will be establishing a client base
beyond my friends and family and competition with other apparel lines.  I am constantly viewing other apparel
collections that could possibly be competition for my genre of artwork and have
found a good number of collections that could be considered similar.  The challenge will be whether or not my apparel
collection stands out amongst them.  I
have no idea of the answer but I believe in myself and my art and will get my
apparel out to as many people as I can by establishing a solid customer base
from selling, word of mouth, and social media.</p>

<br/>The Results: after 30 days of continuous use, MDRN boxers still had their same contour fit and stretch. While they were a little worn as you’d expect, they looked almost as good as new.

<br/>  </div></div>","Why did we start MDRN?Boxers are only the beginning of our crusade to liberate menswear from the archaic businesses that you’ve been stuck with and we hope you join us. We’ve seen a fundamental problem with the men’s basics market. There are cheap brands that don’t last, aren’t very comfortable, and convince you that they are “just good enough”. We don’t think your clothes should be just good enough. On the other end of the spectrum, are designer brands that feature nicer fabrics at extortionary prices and are designed for looks over function resulting in some nice, but expensive and uncomfortable underwear. We’ve spent the last year and a half trying to figure out why there can’t be a happy medium of boxers that are high quality, high comfort, and high performance at a reasonable price. We think that we’ve developed the perfect pair of boxer briefs for the modern gentleman and now we need your help. Why you’ll love our boxersComfortWe’ve designed our boxers to maximize comfort, and we believe that we’ve created some insanely comfortable boxers. They don’t ride up. They aren’t too tight. They have four-way stretch fabric. They breathe easy and dry quickly.Great lookOur co-founders Steve and Keri developed dozens of designs and finally created the perfect pair that are flattering no matter how you’re built and look great both in the locker room and at home.Performance FabricWe’ve sourced our fabrics from premium manufacturers located in the US to ensure maximum quality. Our custom blend of lightweight cotton and spandex blended fabric is designed specifically for these boxers. You literally cannot find this fabric in any other product anywhere in the US… we checked! We’ve combined organic pima cotton that is light, breathable, and quick drying with the stretch and performance of spandex. In addition, we used an anti-microbial treatment to ensure these boxers stay fresh. Our fabric keep your boxers fresher, longer and reduce the odors created by microbes on a daily basis.A Fair PriceWe’ve decided to ditch the traditional apparel business model for a more modern approach with direct-to-consumer online sales. This allows us to cut out the middleman distributors, retail markup, and traditional marketing channels, resulting in a brand made and sold directly to you. Why We Need Your Support100% of your contributions here will fund the first production round of MDRN boxers. In order to produce the high quality fabric that is used to create our boxer briefs at an affordable price point, we need to order several thousand yards of it. By pre-ordering a pair (or 7) here, you will help us reach the threshold needed to make these boxers a reality. The Founding of MDRNCo-founder, Stephen Haugse, has been on-the-go for the past decade. Owning and operating retail stores in Honolulu, HI and commuting monthly to California to manage an online marketing firm, while fitting in a little surfing and hiking on the side. He noticed that his wardrobe – specifically his underwear - could not keep up with the on-the-go lifestyle. He tried dozens of brands, but couldn’t find anything that offered high-quality performance and insane comfort at a reasonable price. Fortunately for him the answer was closer than he could ever imagine!During Stephen’s constant commutes, his girlfriend, Keri Ogden was busy growing her own swimwear business, Elle Mer. Keri grew up on the Big Island of Hawaii, wearing bikinis just about everyday to the beaches along the Kohala coast. Her swimwear business was built on sourcing the best fabrics, stitching the perfect seams, and making swimwear that stays on in even the most powerful shorebreak Hawaii has to offer.Working together, Stephen and Keri began to design the concept of what the perfect pair of men’s boxer briefs should be. The shorts had to be top quality but also priced reasonably. They had to look great and perform better than any pair Stephen had tried to-date.That meant no riding up.They had to be breathable.They had to dry quickly and stay cool on the warmest Hawaiian afternoon. And they had to be insanely comfortable.Using Keri’s design expertise and connections to the best US fabric suppliers & manufacturing, the first MDRN boxer briefs were created.Steve and Keri decided that all MDRN boxer’s should be made in California and shipped around the world. The shorts are sewn in a proprietary method to ensure comfort with every movement. The fabrics are non-pilling, breathable, quick drying, and super stretchy to ensure comfort in any environment.
Custom Designed Features
 No Riding Up - Some brands claim to have boxers that don’t ride up and don’t need adjustment, but overcompensate with tight elastic bands and minimal stretch in the fabric. Our boxers offer the perfect medium to keep everything where it should be without having to add in tight elastic. 2” Premium Elastic Waistband - Smooth to the feel, no loss of elasticity, no warping in the wash or baconing. Don’t worry about frayed edges or stretched out waistbands, our custom elastic will hold tight time after time. The extra tall elastic provides added surface area which in turn delivers a more personal and comfortable fit. Our thin, ultra durable elastic contours to your waistline immediately upon putting them on.No Bothersome Tag - We’ve been there, you just settle in for a 6 hour flight and realize the the tag on your boxers is not going away.

Spain in 1971 along with daughter Mika and others … and much more.


In sum, the files provide an invaluable
record which tell us as much about the observers as they do about the
observed, and the times in which they moved.
   What We Need & What You Get As noted above, we intend eventually to produce eight volumes in total comprising all 1,800 pages of the FBI documents. Reproducing full facsimiles of the Bureau's actual typewritten and handwritten documents is an expensive proposition for which our small publishing company will need help in the way of prepaid orders for this first book off press (8.5"" x 11"", 300 pages).  
Funders who support the 1967-1971 volume at the $20 level will receive the book itself as a 'thank you' gift, this in effect amounting to a 33% discount off the $29.95 list price, with shipping/handling on us. As well, these funders will have their names noted in the acknowledgments, and will be offered the opportunity to purchase subsequent volumes at the discounted $20 price. Funders who contribute $10 or more will get their names in the acknowledgments.
Funders below $10 will receive our grateful thanks. Should we not make our goal of $3000, we will still publish the 1967-1971 volume, but may be forced to reconsider our long-term publication of all eight books.

<p>FRAME is an  easy-to-set-up camera that you can control
fully from your mobile device. It allows you to see in real-time what's going

</div></div>","Our smart camera offers two options that will instantly adapt to your lifestyle. Either FRAME -fixed base- or FRAME 360° -rotatable base- will make your life smarter. 














Our rotation base will provide a 360° degree view of your home or office. The microphone will allow to have two communication and with the 1080p HD video quality you will have full control of your surroundings. 



The infrared functionality will allow you to track motion in low light. Angle adjustment together with a rotational base will provide great flexibility to set FRAME in the best position according to your needs.   



Share electronic messages (Sticky Notes) with your loved ones and friends. FRAME’s rotatable base is equipped with a color indication light that can be set in the App. See who is watching or get an indication of a personal message left behind for you in one of the 16 million colors you can pre-set.   





. 









FRAME is made to last because of its durable technology. Back us up now and enjoy it for years to come without the need of upgrading your hardware.


This feature lets you
record voice messages from your phone to FRAME devices in your home or office. The
indication light lets you know who the message is from and automatically will play when you enter .




FRAME connects to your home
or office's Wi-Fi and notifies you when someone has entered the premises. FRAME
can then be set to take a picture of the person entering and send it to
straight to your mobile device.



Share your moments through LifeSmart App with the live stream feature, invite family members to help you keep-an-eye on your loved ones while you're out. 


FRAME's 8GB will allow you to store videos and images. For an additional fee you will be able to upgrade and keep your recordings from a week up to a month and play them back when you need to see them. Play your video on your
mobile device from any location. 




Upload your favorite
FRAME videos straight from our cloud into your social media. 







Trigger actions between your FRAME camera and other LifeSmart devices.  Create a full smart home experience that is simple to set up and easy to use. Create a full security check up or create triggers to make your life easier.


  
Upgrade your FRAME! Get this incredible Home Automation Kit,  normally at a price of $199 USD and now for $99 USD. Limited time offer!







* Our cameras are stand alone products, therefore, you don't need any other devices to experience FRAME or FRAME 360°.

Want to store your footage? Upgrade through our dedicated cloud storage.  











Yeah! You´ll have an award winning design camera either at your office or at  home.  We are so proud to win ""The Chicago Athenaeum Award 2015"" for Good Design, the oldest and most well known Design Award in the world!
We would like to thank Branch for the fantastic design!























































As we have been working on this project for a long time we have overcome many challenges already. 

Since manufacturing will
be done by a large electronics manufacturer that we have worked with before,
we do not foresee any issues with the quality of the hardware. As soon as the
campaign comes to its end we will start the manufacturing process. We expect to be able to
deliver the first backers in August. Not knowing the exact volumes might be a
challenge. 


We are currently setting
up local servers to support FRAME around the globe. The challenge we face
is whether FRAME will be able to support top speeds for our backers in
countries outside of the USA, Europe, South-America, and Japan. E.g. We have
not been able to test our speeds in Africa.






In this moment, we only
offer LifeSmart App in English. Although we would like to translate LifeSmart App
into other languages this will not be ready on time for the product launch. We have
designed LifeSmart App to be as intuitive as possible with the use of icons but
for some of our users who do not speak English, this might be a challenge. 




All of the functionalities shown in
the screen shots have been developed and are working. New software features
will be released but we don't want to slow down the manufacturing process.









1. How does FRAME work?
FRAME is an  easy-to-set-up camera that you can control
fully from your mobile device. It allows you to see in real-time what's going

also leave messages that get delivered when and where they need to be heard.
FRAME interacts with other LifeSmart devices in your house to
make it a smart home.

use. For some additional features such as cloud storage we will have to ask

<p>Solestice Socks combines the comfort of your favorite pair of socks with the support of an insole. They bring sustainable structure to the arch of your foot so you can stay active and comfortable wherever your feet take you. The stitched-in gel design is custom made to fit in your shoes or wear around the house, always providing you with the comfort you need.</p>

<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">Our Story</h2>
<p>We created Solestice Socks because we were tired of switching our insoles from shoe to shoe and got annoyed when they wouldn’t fit! We also didn’t want to wear dirty shoes around the house to get the support we needed. We wanted something more universal and thought “Why can't the insert be in our socks?” From there we searched the web. However, we couldn’t find what we wanted anywhere. That is when we decided to design our own arch support socks! </p>

<h3>Foot Pain</h3>
<p>Everyone experiences foot pain at some point in their lives. For some it is an ongoing problem. One of the biggest recommendations to combat foot pain is to wear supportive shoes. Unfortunately, most shoes don't have the support our feet need. Solestice Socks gives you that added support regardless of what shoes you are wearing. They even support your feet when you are not wearing shoes!</p>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Are These Machine Washable?</h3>
<p>Yes! As long as you wash our socks in cold water and dry them on low heat, it is safe to do so.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Patent Pending</h3>
<p>Our patent pending, gel absorption technology combines with ergonomic sock compression to give your feet the comfort and support they need to endure the toughest conditions. Our custom gel design continuously shapes to your arch and disperses the pressure of each step by distributing it evenly and comfortably. The dual stitch pattern locks in the gel, providing non-slip, prolonged support.</p>

<h2 style=""text-align: center;""> </h2>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">Silver Fiber Thread</h2>
<p>Silver is a natural antibacterial. For that reason, we weave our socks with silver fiber thread, which allows the silver to continuously remove bacteria and odor. We use pure silver thread so that these antimicrobial properties don't wash away and last for the lifetime of the sock. Germs and bacteria grow in dark, damp places like our shoes and socks, causing odor and irritation. Using silver fiber thread prevents the growth of these germs so you don't have to worry about your socks smelling when you take off your shoes after wearing them all day. </p>

<h3>Works with All Arch Types</h3>
<p>Everyone can benefit from wearing arch supports. With every step you take, your feet take on the weight of your body. When you walk or run, the pressure on your feet can be up to four times more than your body weight. That is why arch supports are so important. They support your feet, no matter what your arch type is, by helping distribute pressure evenly across the bottom of your foot so no one spot ever takes the full brunt of the weight.  </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1601411452/zh4ysjsfp8x0xb8nx7uw.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Our goal is to bring to life ideas that revolutionize the footwear industry. We strive to provide a new level of comfort through initiative. Our footwear unites the best qualities of your favorite socks and custom formed insoles into the perfect hybrid. Take arch support wherever you go and say goodbye to everyday foot pain! We're working each day to reach more people and introduce the innovative ideas and sustainable model of Solestice Socks to the world. Thank you for being part of our journey!</p>

Solestice Socks combines the comfort of your favorite pair of socks with the support of an insole. They bring sustainable structure to the arch of your foot so you can stay active and comfortable wherever your feet take you. The stitched-in gel design is custom made to fit in your shoes or wear around the house, always providing you with the comfort you need.

Our Story
We created Solestice Socks because we were tired of switching our insoles from shoe to shoe and got annoyed when they wouldn’t fit! We also didn’t want to wear dirty shoes around the house to get the support we needed. We wanted something more universal and thought “Why can't the insert be in our socks?” From there we searched the web. However, we couldn’t find what we wanted anywhere. That is when we decided to design our own arch support socks! 
 

 
Foot Pain
Everyone experiences foot pain at some point in their lives. For some it is an ongoing problem. One of the biggest recommendations to combat foot pain is to wear supportive shoes. Unfortunately, most shoes don't have the support our feet need. Solestice Socks gives you that added support regardless of what shoes you are wearing. They even support your feet when you are not wearing shoes!
 



 
 

 
 

 

 
Are These Machine Washable?
Yes! As long as you wash our socks in cold water and dry them on low heat, it is safe to do so.
 
Patent Pending
Our patent pending, gel absorption technology combines with ergonomic sock compression to give your feet the comfort and support they need to endure the toughest conditions. Our custom gel design continuously shapes to your arch and disperses the pressure of each step by distributing it evenly and comfortably. The dual stitch pattern locks in the gel, providing non-slip, prolonged support.
 

 
Silver Fiber Thread
Silver is a natural antibacterial. For that reason, we weave our socks with silver fiber thread, which allows the silver to continuously remove bacteria and odor. We use pure silver thread so that these antimicrobial properties don't wash away and last for the lifetime of the sock. Germs and bacteria grow in dark, damp places like our shoes and socks, causing odor and irritation. Using silver fiber thread prevents the growth of these germs so you don't have to worry about your socks smelling when you take off your shoes after wearing them all day. 
​
 


 
Nonstop Arch Support

 


 
Works with All Arch Types
Everyone can benefit from wearing arch supports. With every step you take, your feet take on the weight of your body. When you walk or run, the pressure on your feet can be up to four times more than your body weight. That is why arch supports are so important. They support your feet, no matter what your arch type is, by helping distribute pressure evenly across the bottom of your foot so no one spot ever takes the full brunt of the weight.  

Our goal is to bring to life ideas that revolutionize the footwear industry. We strive to provide a new level of comfort through initiative. Our footwear unites the best qualities of your favorite socks and custom formed insoles into the perfect hybrid. Take arch support wherever you go and say goodbye to everyday foot pain! We're working each day to reach more people and introduce the innovative ideas and sustainable model of Solestice Socks to the world. Thank you for being part of our journey!

STORY
Hello! We are Carolyn and Mariano the team behind Alium. We met at university 10 years ago while studying textile (Carolyn) and product (Mariano) design, and introduced Alium in 2008, a small shop in Pueblo Garzon, selling a curated collection of Uruguayan-made fashion and furnishings.
Uruguay is a fairly traditional country that has gained international attention lately. We love our traditions and materials and we saw an opportunity to show them to the world in a modern and contemporary way by re-designing our typical Ruanas, Ponchos and Blankets.

Inspired by Merino wool, one of the largest natural resources in Uruguay, we launched our own collection in 2016, a selection of ruanas, ponchos and blankets handcrafted by knitters around the country.
Our goal is to deliver a high quality product, combining contemporary design with traditional craftmanship and natural materials, and also revalue local artisans as a fundamental part of the production process, which has been set aside by mass production companies.

What we need and what you get.

After seeing the success of our first collection in 2016, we realized it was time for alium to blossom in a much bigger way. We are designing a new and bigger collection for the South American summer 2017, including Ruanas, Ponchos, Blankets, and tablewear. 
We need your help to produce our second collection for the summer 2017. In addition to the Garzon shop we are planning a small place on the square in the beach town of Jose Ignacio.In order to make it happen we need to double our production and expand to new lines of products such as bags and ceramic tablewear.By contributing with alium you will be helping local knitters and wool mills who work with us as outsource suppliers.You will also help us create a strong southamerican brand which promotes and respects natural materials and local traditions.*If we dont reach our fund goal, the money will be destined only to produce our new collection of products for this summer 2017.
Details of investment.
The money will be destined to produce your rewards, the entire collection of ruanas ponchos, blankets, ceramic tableware for next summer, and extras such as packaging, photoshoot, print catalogues, etc.

The rest goest to Indie gogo fees, additional costs and taxes.

Uruguay es un país bastante tradicional que ha ganado atención internacional últimamente. Nos encantan nuestras tradiciones y materiales, y vimos una oportunidad para mostrar al mundo nuestras tipicas ruanas ponchos y mantas de una manera moderna y contemporánea.

Nuestro objetivo es ofrecer un producto de alta calidad, que combina el diseño contemporáneo con artesanía tradicional y materiales naturales, y también revalorizar los artesanos locales, como parte fundamental del proceso de producción, que han sido desplazados por producciones en masa.
Lo que necesitamos y lo que tu otienes
Después de ver el éxito de nuestra primera colección en 2016, nos dimos cuenta de que era hora de alium florecer de una manera mucho más grande. Estamos diseñando una nueva y más grande colección para el verano sudamericano 2017, incluyendo ruanas, ponchos, mantas y objetos de hogar.
Necesitamos su ayuda para producir nuestra segunda colección para el verano de 2017 y además de la tienda de Garzón estamos planeando abrir un pequeño local en la plazas de Jose Ignacio.
Con el fin de hacer que esto suceda tenemos que duplicar nuestra producción y expandirnos a nuevas líneas de productos tales como: bolsos y objetos para el hogar.

¿Por qué Lana Merino?
La lana merino, uno de los mayores recursos naturales del Uruguay. Conocido por ser uno de los mejores fibras naturales y renovables. Es muy suave, respira y también es apta para cualquier condición meteorológica. Es muy fácil de cuidar gracias a su capa protectora natural que evita los olores y las manchas.

<h3>Story of KOJO</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1487542409/pxuwyamrfwjvpqc09jsm.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>My name is Jana and I am mom of a 16 months old son FIlip. I am practicing contact parenting and I think breastfeeding is crucial in the early child development period. I am an active person too. My day to day life is connected with sports activity the same way as it is with food and sleep. I have always practiced running and hiking, and I love time spent outside - in nature, in any weather conditions. When Filip, my son was born, I started to carry him  in a baby-wrap. KOJO idea came up during one of my walks in nature with Filip wrapped to me. My baby was whining and I needed to breastfeed him. I found it too difficult to find and get the breast out of the tight, skinny, regular activewear I was wearing to make my newborn satisfied and calm. I started to think about <strong>combination of activewear made of perfect materials, for all kind of outdoor activities with the comfort of Tshirts designed specialy for breastfeeding mothers.</strong></p>

<p>The journey from the basic idea to the final product was longer, than I expected. I had no intention to start my own brand with such a specific product. I searched the local market and later the internet, but I found nothing matching my demand.  No product did really match the design and material that I was looking for. </p>
<p>After long days of struggle finally I found an ecofriendly and sustainable  family owned  local company. This company, I am partnering with is developing and manufacturing their own syntetic and wool fiber and whole production is based in Slovakia, Europe. Production process and used materials are guarantee of top quality of KOJO activewear.</p>

<p>We tried using cheap, plasticky bands and other tidying mechanisms sent our way from China only to find ourselves even more frustrated than when we first started. </p>

<p>We will be able to deliver the Cable Hug to you right at the end of this campaign. No months to wait. Pre-order everyone's favourite future Xmas gift now.</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>With this campaign, we want to show Indiegogo supporters that as much as a taboo product as someone may perceive them, precious Italian exotic leather can actually be a luxurious, eco alternative to mass-produced, highly-toxic plastic cable-management systems.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Civitas Regis exotic leathers come only from unused scraps and clippings that other big name brands left over from their production processes. So not only will you have the pleasure of storing and tiding your cables in a stylish way; you will be able to do so in an ecological way.</p>
<h3>BONUS: Bundle Perks</h3>

<p>We recognise that other tidying-bands solutions do exist out there and that, therefore, we are not creating a revolutionary, break-through product.<br/>However, our product has many points of strength against such solutions</p>
<p><strong>1</strong>. Cable Hug is made entirely using repurposed scraps of exotic leather, the most sought-after of its sector. Not only is it a precious, high-end product; it is also an ethical, ecological way to reuse the wastage of leather produced by an always-thirsty fashion market.</p>
<p><strong>2</strong>. The leather we use for the Cable Hug is tanned and processed completely in Italy by families of tanners that have been doing this for many generations. The Civitas Regis Cable Hug is not only made from the highest quality leather in the world, it is also a piece of tradition and timeless history.</p>
<p><strong>3</strong>. Our full range of products, of which Cable Hug represents the latest addition, is not a mass-produced, cheap plastic from China. It's uniquely crafted for you. Civitas Regis's mission to repurpose scraps and wastage of leather also makes every piece a one-of-a-kind item.</p>
<p>Note to Backers: We cannot be held responsible for any issues at customs which backers may experience when their prize imported into their country.

Rather, it has become a lifestyle accessory, a “personal statement” for men, so to speak. For them, it is a major, often the only one piece of jewellery and as such, it should have a very personal touch, and express the statement of status and sophistication.

For us it was “foldable sunglasses”, while the concept of reducing in size an item that needs to be carried around all day is fantastic, there was a flaw. They fold leaving the lens on the outside, unprotected, effectively rendering the whole process futile. They cannot be carried in pockets or bags without having to bring an extra case to avoid annoying scratches. For normal sunglasses is even worse, lens are unprotected, they are space consuming and get in the way when not needed. </p><p>This got us thinking, what if the whole structure could transform at will to protect the delicate parts and adapt to various situations and needs? How could we make them them useful also when they are not on your face?

Sunglasses like no others. There is no reason why technical eyewear have to be ugly and cost a fortune. You can do anything with our BÆNDIT. Just lock the UNSHAKEABLE™ to your ear by bending the sides to your comfort or activity.              1 year of prototyping, 2 years and 4 generations of BÆNDIT Sunglasses and we are ready to introduce the UNSHAKEABLE™. We perfected materials, streamlined our operations and production to come out with the only sunglasses you will ever need.     Each  pair of sunglasses comprised of 5 interchangeable parts that allow for extreme flexibility. The shades can be worn loosely with ease, until they need to be transformed for a kite surfing or beach volleyball session, in which case they can be instantly moulded into any shape for maximum stability and protection.  When it’s time to store the glasses you have the option to fold them to protect the lenses and store in any small compartment, or wrap them to fit comfortably around your wrist, belt loop or anywhere. BÆNDIT’s exclusive metal and TPEE polymer core allows the glasses to take and maintain any desired shape without sacrificing quality or care.             All BÆNDIT pieces are interchangeable and work with all BÆNDIT models, creating a customisable collection with endless combinations. You can mix and match pieces to create a completely distinct pair of sunglasses that speak to your personal needs in both fashion and function. With the collection’s patent pending structure, the glasses can be deconstructed to fit in the tightest of spaces.  In addition to this market changing design, the glasses contain the best 100% UVA and UVB protection lenses available.       One pair of BÆNDITs is made of 5 interchangeable modules, 3 fully flexible sections, 2 adjustable parts, 7 different materials, the best.        How strong are our lens? Not only sun protection, full impact protection too.                Last generation of thermoplastics materials. TR90 for the frame, TPE-EE for the skeleton cover, indestructible Polycarbonate for the lens and a core of plastic annealed Stainless Steal composite . No other sunglasses uses as many blends and materials and no other required all this effort.                                 Get an extra UNSHAKEABLE™ temples and nose set for 19 USD.                   BÆNDIT CAN MIX THROUGHOUT OUR FULL COLLECTION               All ideas start with a disappointment. For us it was “foldable sunglasses”, while the concept of reducing in size an item that needs to be carried around all day is fantastic, there was a flaw. They fold leaving the lens on the outside, unprotected, effectively rendering the whole process futile. They cannot be carried in pockets or bags without having to bring an extra case to avoid annoying scratches. For normal sunglasses is even worse, lens are unprotected, they are space consuming and get in the way when not needed. This got us thinking, what if the whole structure could transform at will to protect the delicate parts and adapt to various situations and needs? How could we make them them useful also when they are not on your face? Fully flexible and bendable eyewear structure was born, BÆND IT.We then went a step further: could it be possible to make them modular too? A revolutionary composite structure was conceptualised so that our eyewear can be separated and recombined in 5 pieces. 3 parts to allow the flexibility and 2 to carry the best lens in the market. After a year of engineering and testing BÆNDIT was finally born. Forward another 2 years and 4 generations and we have the UNSHAKEABLE™ .The modularity allows users to change colours and shapes to best fit your mood and style without having to buy multiple expensive sunglasses and the bendability keeps them right where you need them to be. Bændit, Revolution by Design. Finally the elephant in the room, how were we able to drop the prices from 120 to the current ones. 1 Reengineering of the sunglasses. The first 3 generations of Bandit eyewear used a metal core with a silicon casing. This meant that the links (where the temples and nose piece attached to the solid TR90 lens frames) needed a hand welded 4 pins anchor for the temples and a hand welded 8 pins anchor for the nose piece, this costed a fortune and also was not effective as with use the silicon casing connection would wear off or worse in case of hard pressure rip, exposing the metal structure.For the UNSHAKABLE™ we developed a TPEE composite of Polytetra-methylene glycol and Crystalline Polybutylene Terephthalate, basically hard and soft fully plastic materials so the casing for the connection provides for the anchorage system, making them 100 times stronger and resistant to wear and tear as well as a lot more cost effective to make. 2 Discounting development costs, engineering and material studies as well as moulds.All of this reengineering and development costs are not embedded in the price of the sunglasses and we believe we will recoup the investment in the long run with plenty of happy customers.  3 Streamlining operations focusing on direct sales.We now have 3 production facilities and have 7 different suppliers for the “ingredients” of the sunglasses.

<h2>Where It All Started...</h2>
<p> </p>
<p>Hi! I'm Dirma and I love nature. Privasack  was born out of my love for the outdoors. The beach, the lake, the mountains... outside is where I've always loved to be! I also happen tothink that everyone should spend as much time in nature as possible; it's good for the soul! So I never miss an opportunity to feed my spirit, by taking in as much of this beautiful world at every chance I get. But all that outdoor playing left me very disappointed with options to change out of my play clothes.  That's why I created Privasack: to provide quick, portable privacy for all of us!</p>
<p>This crowdfunding campaign is for the purpose of creating a new and improved version of Privasack. I want to also increase production so we can have a major re-launch of the new <strong>Privasack 2.0 just in time for Spring/Summer 2018.</strong></p>
<p><strong><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1509536127/kaluzjj8kekwgbilnkj7.jpg"" src=""""/></strong></p>

<h2><strong>Privasack is...</strong></h2>
<p>Privasack is made of colorful, durable Nylon, flexible stainless steel (the key to it keeping its shape while in use) and an elastic opening at the top for ease of entry and exit. There are no zippers, no pockets, no buttons, no strings or pulleys...just a simple enclosed sack with an opening at the top for you to get in, get changed, get out, and get on with it!</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1509536243/ir9tu2penazli8ucahf2.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>The images you are seeing are of the original prototype. With the new design, you will get a wider, roomier base with lots of extra space to change, giving you comfort and confidence. Our Patent Pending design is the only one with an completely enclosed base, which ensures that your change of clothes remain clean and dry inside the sack.</p>
<p>Privasack can be enjoyed by men and women of all ages...we are even working on a design for parents to assist small children who can't change themselves.</p>
<h2> </h2>
</div><div>
<h2>This Is Why We Launched This Campaign:</h2>
<p>As happy as we are with the current version of our product, we have identified the areas where we can make Privasack even better: </p>
<p>1. Mass Production: If we produce a massive amount of product, our production cost will go down and we will gladly pass down that savings to you! More product + Lower Price = More people can enjoy Privasack everywhere! <strong>Note: By joining our campaign, you are guaranteed to pay an even lower price than the reduced price we are hoping to achieve; so get your Privasack TODAY at the lowest price possible!</strong></p>
<p>2. New, roomy design: We think that by expanding the base and body, more people will feel comfortable using Privasack for all their public changing needs. We will also introduce new colors: our customers let us know that they prefer simple, darker colors to ensure even more privacy as they changed. We will keep the popular Hot Pink and Deep Blue Sea, and add Black Onyx and Forest Green. We love to listen to our awesome customers to give you what you want!</p>
<p>3. Increase outreach: With the funds we acquire, we will also be able to use social media in a more powerful way to spread the word about Privasack. Every time folks hear about Privasack they get excited and often say ""I've been needing this my whole life!"" With social media, not only can  we reach out to the people who would most enjoy this product, but we can engage with you in a more personal way by getting to know our customer and finding ways to make Privasack even more of what you want! We want to reach more people so everyone, everywhere, can say ""I've been needing this my whole life!""</p>
<p>By contributing to this campaign not only will you get to own this amazing product which gives you the freedom to change anywhere (If you contribute at the purchase levels), but you will also have the satisfaction of knowing that you made it possible for Privasack to reach more people!</p>
<h3>What We Are Asking and What We Will Do With the Funds:</h3>
<p>We are asking for a total of US $20,000. This, in the simplest of terms, will be distributed as such:</p>
<ul>
<li>12,000: To increase production of the new and improved Privasack.</li>
<li> 8,000: Improved social media engagement and an outreach campaign to identify a production or licensing partner. This will allow us to go above and beyond our current expansion goals.</li>
</ul>
<p>If we were so lucky as to exceed our requested amount, we could expand production even further and go on to hire a small staff to make the process even more efficient. The more we raise, the more we can achieve! <strong>NOTE: WE GUARANTEE WE WILL DELIVER YOUR ORDER, REGARDLESS OF HOW MUCH WE RAISE. PROMISE!!!!</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>Here Are The Perks:</strong></h2>
<p>Currently, we have 4 Perk levels:</p>

<h2>Project ""Love-A-Sack""</h2>
<p> </p>
<p>At one of our promotional events, we were approached by a very nice lady who informed us that she was homeless. She said ""Privasack would be perfect for homeless people, because we are always looking for a private place to change clothes."" That conversation lit a spark within us and gave us a grand mission: The Love-A-Sack Project, where we will partner with and share part of our proceeds with organizations that assist and seek to house people in need of shelter. We are honored to have this mission! Think about it: Privasack is a solution for what is very much a First World Problem. I started this company because I love the outdoors and figured it would be awesome to make a living doing something I love. But now, with this project, this is more than a fun job: there is real passion and purpose behind it now, and we are all really blessed to do this. We will keep you informed about the strides we make with this project. Stay tuned!</p>

<p>My mother, Yolette Fontaine,  and I left a beautiful life in Haiti in the midst of political unrest in the late 80s when her fashion boutique was burned down. She lost everything and had to begin again. </p>
<p>Over these past few years, we have been creating, with a goal to maximize and grow the I Am Kreyol fashion brand. Our mission is simple. We seek to empower women to change their narrative and create the life they envision. I Am Kreyol is a fashion brand with a purpose- a movement. Our garments are made to enhance our customer's inner beauty and sense of confidence while impacting the lives of women back home. We are seeking to produce our garments in Haiti to work with skilled artisans to provide the opportunity for sustainable income and creativity in the workforce.</p>

<p>In the past, Haiti was known for their expertise in garment production, embroidery, and accessory design. There has been a great deal of progress in the country in the past eight years after the earthquake. Haiti has transitioned from a post-disaster era to a period of reconstruction and development, slowly closing the 70% unemployment gap. Thousands of needed jobs have been created in the growing export apparel sector. With the HOPE Act (Haitian Hemispheric Opportunity through Partnership Encouragement Act), I Am Kreyol will be able to take advantage of duty-free treatment of select apparel imports from now until September 30th, 2025, which would cut down costs tremendously. Working with our production partner, Tribes of Joseph, this would allow us to work with Haitian artisans at a fair working wage, providing the best quality garments for our customers and continuous income for sustainable living for our workers.</p>

My mother, Yolette Fontaine,  and I left a beautiful life in Haiti in the midst of political unrest in the late 80s when her fashion boutique was burned down. She lost everything and had to begin again. 
Over these past few years, we have been creating, with a goal to maximize and grow the I Am Kreyol fashion brand. Our mission is simple. We seek to empower women to change their narrative and create the life they envision. I Am Kreyol is a fashion brand with a purpose- a movement. Our garments are made to enhance our customer's inner beauty and sense of confidence while impacting the lives of women back home. We are seeking to produce our garments in Haiti to work with skilled artisans to provide the opportunity for sustainable income and creativity in the workforce.




In the past, Haiti was known for their expertise in garment production, embroidery, and accessory design. There has been a great deal of progress in the country in the past eight years after the earthquake. Haiti has transitioned from a post-disaster era to a period of reconstruction and development, slowly closing the 70% unemployment gap. Thousands of needed jobs have been created in the growing export apparel sector.

<h3>The Problem</h3>
<p>With increasing prices in men's clothing, buying high quality apparel through a respected brand is becoming more and more difficult today for the average man. Popular Surf, Skate, and Athletic brands hold a monopoly on Mens clothing; and because there is such a high demand, companies raise their prices without creating better products.</p>
<h3>Our Solution</h3>
<p>Aarose offers a business model that gives the consumer a brand that they can love and wear every day; as well as sell independently with reasonable margins. We focus on the <strong>consumer </strong>which in this case is both the buyer and the seller. The easier it is to help the consumer wholesell our clothes, the more in turn he will be able to buy himself. This creates a win-win partnership as well as a culture centered around self-sufficiency and unity</p>
<h3>Why Help Us</h3>
<p>Backing this project will:</p>
<ul>
<li>Jump-start an opportunity to disrupt the way mens apparel is bought and sold</li>
<li>Create thousands of jobs</li>
<li>Push mens apparel to become more innovative and quality oriented rather than brand oriented</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Mutually Beneficial </h3>
<p>We need $4000 to start up phase one of the operation. Starting at custom designed T-shirts, Shorts, and Hats we can then begin to bring on individual whole-sellers (regular people) to market, sell, and advertise the product itself. All who contribute will receive a personal thank you, as well as email updates explaining the progress of the first and later phases. They will also be the first to be offered wholeselling positions, and some may participate in decision making activities and corporate level positions. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Though the ultimate goal is to create new jobs and improve the American economy as a whole, there is no guarantee that it will be a success. In order for this to happen Aarose must transition from a novice indie type company into a full cooperation. We plan on doing this by scaling our business one step at a time, through hard work and determination, and by placing all equity and profit back into the company and it's representitives in order to reach our big picture.</p>

<h3>The Positivity Bracelet Story</h3>
<p>I want to talk about an issue that is not getting enough attention. I want to talk about mental health. It seems that today, mental health is more stigmatized than ever despite the rise in teens who have mental health disorders. Today, 1 in 5 teenagers have a diagnosable mental health disorder. Only HALF of those teens ever receive the treatment they need. Suicide is now the THIRD leading cause of death in teenagers behind car accidents and homicide. Something has to change.</p> <p>Why the sudden rise? What’s different today that is causing this dramatic rise in mental illness?</p> <p>This sudden rise in mental illness can be attributed to a couple of causes. The most recognizable of these causes is the stigmatization of mental health in general. Let me elaborate on that. It seems that today more than ever, we think of mental health in a negative light. When somebody mentions mental illness, we automatically associate it with a serious illness. We often dehumanize people who are actively admitting their disorder and are reaching out for help. What kind of position does this put 20% of our youth in? The result is a vicious cycle. Suicides rise, we cast mental health into an even darker light, and the stigma grows deeper.

</div></div>","The Positivity Bracelet Story
I want to talk about an issue that is not getting enough attention. I want to talk about mental health. It seems that today, mental health is more stigmatized than ever despite the rise in teens who have mental health disorders. Today, 1 in 5 teenagers have a diagnosable mental health disorder. Only HALF of those teens ever receive the treatment they need. Suicide is now the THIRD leading cause of death in teenagers behind car accidents and homicide. Something has to change. Why the sudden rise? What’s different today that is causing this dramatic rise in mental illness? This sudden rise in mental illness can be attributed to a couple of causes. The most recognizable of these causes is the stigmatization of mental health in general. Let me elaborate on that. It seems that today more than ever, we think of mental health in a negative light. When somebody mentions mental illness, we automatically associate it with a serious illness. We often dehumanize people who are actively admitting their disorder and are reaching out for help. What kind of position does this put 20% of our youth in? The result is a vicious cycle. Suicides rise, we cast mental health into an even darker light, and the stigma grows deeper. More teens are looked at as mental cases instead of human beings. This NEEDS to change. How can you join the cause? I will be donating 2 dollars out of every bracelet sale to Mental Health America, an organization dedicated to raising awareness for mental health. That’s over 10% of each sale. The biggest impact my brand is going to have is reducing the stigma on mental health. I want to make anxiety and depression something that we can openly talk about with our friends and family so that if someone needs help, they can find it easier. As the problem stands today, young adults feel as though they can’t talk about how they’re feeling. They’re afraid of being cast out and looked down upon and they should not have to be. When you wear a Positivity Bracelet, you’re joining our cause. You’re actively standing up against the stigma on mental health and teen suicide. Pat yourself on the back, you’re helping fight an issue that has gone unnoticed for far too long. The teenagers of today are the FUTURE of our nation and society is not doing enough to help them. Together, we are going to change how we think of mental health. Join the movement.

Why do I need the support?
I want to grow this brand to radically change the way our society talks about mental health. If I hit my goal, I'll be able to expand this message and continue raising money so that those who need treatment can receive it.

The Impact
Together, we are going to CHANGE the way people discuss their personal mental health. Teenagers should be able to discuss their feelings openly without feeling like they're being dehumanized or judged.

Local communities are thus forced to encroach steep slopes for farming.RESULTS? high soil erosion.River pollution both by siltation and leaching. Steep Slopes are not sustainably productive and this leads to poor yields and thus the farmers end up incurring losses.Green Nettle Textile team chose to see an opportunity where others saw a challenge. Demand for clothing increases with the high population growth in the continent. Producing these in a conservative way is a gateway to a sustainable future. Our solution is simple yet groundbreaking: work with Mother Earth, not against her. Stinging nettle which is native in these areas is a true survivor, requiring just a bit of sun, a little amount of water, and whatever soil already exists. In return, the plant grows stalks that can be transformed into quality eco-fabric. Better still, process leftovers can be converted into different commercial products. This revolutionary approach will provide jobs and nutrients to over 200,000 smallholder farmers across Kenya.

<p><strong>Lucy Fragrances</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Something old, something new. Our perfume connects the past and the present so we can move into the future.</p>
<p>In the ancient world, people used plants to extract different scents and wear them. Wearing these scents was a sign of cleanliness and beauty. It was also believed that there were medicinal values of putting on perfume. For instance, Lavender was used to reduce anxiety and Frankincense was used as an antiseptic. Now, the science supports what our ancestors have known for thousands of years. </p>
<p>Made from 100% natural and organic ingredients, Lucy is made from blends of fresh citrus, oriental warm notes and tropical flowers to create the perfect harmony. Our carefully curated blends of natural fragrances will have you smelling naturally beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>About Us</strong></p>
<p>We are a couple of young women who are deeply passionate about creating an authentic product that represents the place we call home, Ethiopia.  Edom is a Biochemistry graduate shifting gears into the world of business. Senait is a Marketing and Management graduate with experience working with several businesses in Ethiopia. Together we make a strong team that is able to take on diverse challenges and successfully overcome them. </p>
<p><strong>Why you should fund Lucy</strong></p>
<p>We plan on manufacturing our perfumes from start to finish in Ethiopia. We will use the profits we earn from this phase to start our long term goal of locally producing all the ingredients we require to create our perfumes. Ethiopia is rich in land and resources that are used in the cosmetic industry. However, the country mainly exports these raw materials for a small price and imports perfumes for a much higher price. If we can add value by processing the raw materials we can decrease the amount of imports and hence foreign currency spent outside. </p>
<p>Our perfume will be one of the few perfumes made in Africa and the first natural perfume made in Ethiopia. So let’s make history together!</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What the funds will pay for</strong></p>
<p>We have already made several different scents and we are loving them, and can’t wait to share them with all of you. In order to start making more, we need more supplies like perfume bottles, different ingredients, mixer machines, and packaging materials. </p>
<p>In funding this project, you will get the first whiff of our perfume before it hits the market. And at the $200 level you'll even get to provide input that will be incorporated into the final scent and have your name engraved on the bottle you receive. Even if we don't reach our intended funding goal of $2,000, what we do raise will bring us closer to being able to get started.</p>

<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Hello, future IndieGoGo backers!</strong></p>
<p>We're a new garment company that reflects the voice of a great American subculture. Observing some of the influencers that have paved the way for Hip Hops lasting impression on the world. From rap, break dancing and graffiti, to tv, movies and fashion. We hope to provide ""statement"" t-shirts with the flyest designs, committed to quality for everyday wear. </p>
<p>We are here to raise money to get started. Well, continue growth in the foundation already laid. Building a brand that reflects where we're from and how far we've come to bring you a fresh take on active wear. By backing this campaign you will be helping to fulfill the dream of three brothers who love designing new, objective, good looking gear.</p>

<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">What We're Working To Accomplish</h2>
<p>The whole reason we're starting this campaign is to ask for your help in obtaining the necessary equipment for this venture. Let's start with the basics.</p>
<p>The initial challenge we face is the procurement of the DTG (Direct To Garment) digital printer, one we hope to invest in that will allow us to be able to produce top quality shirts using the latest and best equipment. A DTG Curing Heat Press, Sublimation printer, as well as other applicable supplies such as inks, papers, etc. We are still working with textile companies and t-shirt makers to buy the best quality shirts for the best price. Initially we will buy our shirts from a third party. While being able to get a good wholesale price, we really want to be able to make the product from start to finish. Not having to go through a printing service would help us immediately in the areas of lowering the cost of production per shirt, as well as helping the speed of distribution.</p>
<p><strong>RICOH Ri 1000 Direct to Garment Printer</strong> - High production DTG printer - This is the most important piece of equipment to our business. Having this machine will alleviate outsourcing to printers - Retail $16k </p>
<p><strong>ST3042 Sublimation 3D Vacuum Heat Press</strong> - Sublimation printer - Used to transfer dye on to plastics/ceramics/papers to generate graphics/photos - Retail $800 </p>
<p><strong>HPN Craftpro 12x15 Heat Press</strong> - High pressure heat press - Needed to transfer/seal images for labels, tags and graphics - Retail $450</p>
<p>What gets generated from this campaign will go towards these items and other materials that we have vendors in place to fulfill, i.e. shirts, inks, papers, etc. </p>

<p>The company will be an ode to Art, an ode to album covers and concert posters of the 70's. It will be a political view or satirical observation, such as the Nixon ""toilet"" poster, or the humor of everyday life. What we have is a plan to start this t-shirt company because of a couple reasons, one being the love of art and its placement. T-shirts are that perfect form for what we are going to do, create amazing thought on shirts.</p>
<p>This company has been put together by 3 brothers, whose vision is to bring something fresh to t-shirt art, urban in nature, stylish, under and overstated in message. The art and illustrations will hammer home the intellectual, silly, and often sarcastic world we live in. Drawing emotions as well as thought, we want to make people think, not just sell them t-shirts. On top of it all, we are making the products ourselves, a home grown American textile company.</p>

While being able to get a good wholesale price, we really want to be able to make the product from start to finish. Not having to go through a printing service would help us immediately in the areas of lowering the cost of production per shirt, as well as helping the speed of distribution.

HPN Craftpro 12x15 Heat Press - High pressure heat press - Needed to transfer/seal images for labels, tags and graphics - Retail $450
What gets generated from this campaign will go towards these items and other materials that we have vendors in place to fulfill, i.e. shirts, inks, papers, etc.

That's That Fly S***
Here it is!  The lifestyle brand that has a finger on the pulse of our culture.  What culture, you may ask?  The culture that reflects the struggle, courage and commitment it takes to level up.  Taking all that life has to throw at you and turning the bleak into laughable afterthoughts.  Of course with a bit of satire and social commentary, we want to create streetwear with a voice.  Having the approach that ""We all we got!""  We, meaning the people.  Let's get it!

What We're About
The company will be an ode to Art, an ode to album covers and concert posters of the 70's. It will be a political view or satirical observation, such as the Nixon ""toilet"" poster, or the humor of everyday life. What we have is a plan to start this t-shirt company because of a couple reasons, one being the love of art and its placement. T-shirts are that perfect form for what we are going to do, create amazing thought on shirts.
This company has been put together by 3 brothers, whose vision is to bring something fresh to t-shirt art, urban in nature, stylish, under and overstated in message. The art and illustrations will hammer home the intellectual, silly, and often sarcastic world we live in. Drawing emotions as well as thought, we want to make people think, not just sell them t-shirts. On top of it all, we are making the products ourselves, a home grown American textile company.

Telling the time on INFINITY Ⅱ  is different from all other automatics. It uses a 5-layer dial layout that indicates hours (inner upper index), minutes (outer whole-circle index), and seconds (inner lower index). Combined with a multi-hand system - 2 hour-hands in a 180°arrangement, 1 minute-hand in a special triangle shape, and 3 second-hands in a 120° layout, INFINITY Ⅱ  presents one of the most distinctive time displays that has ever been created and one that is an instant conversation starter!  Have no fear of the dark, and let your style shine bright in the night! INFINITY Ⅱ uses the latest Swiss Super-LumiNova coating on both Index and Hand surfaces that enable you to read the time even in a very dark environment, adding modern convenience to a watch with a classic soul inside! Compared to the other 3 versions, the White version features a dedicated Night Vision design that delivers a friendly user experience!  With a unique concept in mind, INFINITY Ⅱ is designed to stand out and impress at first sight. From its intricate mechanical details to its bold stylish aesthetics, it is a true one-of-a-kind.A great mechanical automatic relies on superior design and thoughtful craftsmanship. INFINITY Ⅱ  is crafted with the latest cutting-edge technology and sophisticated processing, ensuring that perfection is expressed from any angle.   INFINITY Ⅱ’s case is designed with 44 individual facets and one sophisticated crown that are all hand-polished with dedicated tools and specially coated with Ceracote Ceramic Coating*, a thin-film protective ceramic coating widely used in military weapon manufacturing. This ultra-durable finish greatly improves the rigidity, heat, and scratch-resistance of INFINITY Ⅱ  for an enduring look that lasts for years.*(Ceracote coating is exclusive for the White & Green Case versions, Blue & Black Case versions are coated with PVD) INFINITY Ⅱ’s easy-change strap is made of Fluoro rubber, which is a superior polymer material that is waterproof and highly resistant to oils, temperature changes, and harsh environments. These vividly colored straps are durable, colorfast, and comfortable on the skin.Note: you can purchase the extra strap in the add-on section, choose your color to add them to your pledge in check out. You can refer to the picture below for different color combinations: INFINITY Ⅱ is made with an anti-reflection Sapphire Crystal that protects the inner workings of the watch. Compared to traditional Mineral Crystal, it’s more scratch and smudge resistant, ultra-protective, and lasts longer. OLTO-8 has an experienced in-house R&D team dedicated to optimizing the Infinity II movement. They begin with a Japanese Miyota 82S5 Movement and customize it for INFINITY  Ⅱ, to work perfectly with its 180° semi-circular time display. The movement and the watch include a 2-year International Warranty and are designed for years of maintenance-free operation. Born with a classic soul, INFINITY Ⅱ also encourages a bold heart to explore! It features a 5 ATM waterproof rating, which can withstand a pressure of 5 bar or a depth of 50 meters.

Our focus is on creating sustainable, ethically sourced, and naturally tanned premium leather goods that are both beautiful and functional.
 


Choose from our four beautiful patinas: Black, Brown, Midnight Blue or Beige.
 
Introducing our Versatile Leather Bag. We designed this multifunctional waterproof bag to be all you need for your daily carry. It easily transforms from a briefcase to a backpack or a crossbody messenger depending on your changing needs throughout the day. Our bags are made with modern machinery but hold the old-world charisma and durability that you would look for in an elegant leather bag.

Never get lost in the abyss, as everything has its place in this thought-out multi-pocketed design. A Place for Everything​The front panel can be fully unzipped for easy access to your commonly used items.    We found four problems when looking into leather products and how the big name brands are operating.
Hazardous chemicals are used to cut down production time
Top-quality materials cost too much money
Most of the time animals are killed for only leather
Workers are not treated correctly and not getting paid enough
 We solved the problem by:
Eliminating the use of Hazardous Chemicals (Chromium, Lead, Azo-dyes) and by adapting the vegetable tanning process
Providing premium quality (Full-grain/Top-grain) in a fraction of the price
Sourcing organically, means we are using leathers that are the by-products of human meat consumption. The leathers could go to waste and harm the environment if they were not processed and used. We made sure zero animal killing only for leather
Making sure that we address the issue seriously and everyone gets fair pay, benefits and proper training

   Zwuits is a peoples company first and we have creatively structured our business model to benefit our workers’ needs. We strongly believe happy healthy employees, foster a happier healthier workforce. With your support, we can continue to produce beautiful, functional, cost-effective products and offer great benefits to enhance the quality of life of our employees in Bangladesh.      All our products are manufactured in Bangladesh, which is home to many large USA brands. In order to ensure our products are made with the highest standards, we want to help our workers as they help us grow. Regardless of skill or position in the company, all employees get the same benefits package.
 


 

 We rely on the centuries-old condensed/catechol method of vegetable tanning with the use of modern equipment. It includes extracts of Gambier, Mimosa Bark, and Quebracho Wood. Due to the lack of strong chemicals, this method takes up to 35 days depending on the season. The result -- a beautiful item with rich, warm tones that looks entirely natural and smells just the way you think leather should.    We began our journey with one thing in mind, quality goods that are affordable. However, as we dug deeper into leather manufacturing, it quickly became apparent that there was a major problem in the industry - most chrome oil-tanned leather is produced with highly toxic chemicals that cause allergic and asthmatic reactions - not to mention leads to a risk of lung cancer.Not only an issue for the consumers who buy leather products, but this hazardous manufacturing process also affects the lives of those who make the products. The products can cause:
Many skin diseases such as ""Chrome Holes""
Respiratory problems
Infertility
Congenital disabilities
Drinking water pollution
 The health risks of the chrome tanning method are high and that was something the team at Zwuits is not willing to be part of. We adopted a hazardous chemical-free, vegetable tanning method that is safe for the users of our products as well as those who make them.    Founded by Habib Ferdous a lifelong learner, successful accountant, and serial entrepreneur.Habib came a long way from selling newspapers in front of Canning Town station in London to becoming a successful accountant and business owner in New York.
