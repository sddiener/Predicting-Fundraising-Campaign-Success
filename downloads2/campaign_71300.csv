</h3> <p>We started homeschooling our children seven years ago. About a year ago we discovered one of our daughters was dyslexic.  After searching high and low for a program that would help us to teach her uniqueness, we found the perfect program.  However, it would require many days of traveling and most of our budget for curriculum.  So we started to figure out what changes would have to be made in order to make it work. We had a 'Eureka!' moment as we realized the way we were homeschooling our five children could be changed. Drastically.</p>
<p>So we designed a curriculum that freed us from feeling trapped by our home and by our finances. We got rid of some bells and whistles, which always lost the focus of the child anyway, and centered it on the classics. We designed assignments to teach each student how to think critically in every subject. We focused on digitizing everything we could, so all of our books and materials could fit into a single backpack and travel with us anywhere. Even the Instructor's Guide.  Finally, a curriculum that allows all of us to maximize 
extracurriculars - athletics, field trips, internships, and other life experiences - with more control and 
affordability. </p>
<p>At the core of the curriculum we use art, journaling, and creating a portfolio as a vehicle for the student to express who they are and show a progression of maturity. Students can focus their journaling and portfolio-building on their interests and their strengths. By the end of 12th grade a student will have a mature, well-rounded portfolio which demonstrates the person they are to potential colleges, universities, and employers.</p>
<p>And The Artistic Homeschooler was started... <br/></p>
<br/><br/><h3>What Makes Our Curriculum Different?</h3>
<p>Focusing on Middle and High School grades, we will be writing a total
 of six guides covering grades 7-12. Each guide will cover History, Art 
History, Science, Language, Grammar and Composition, Latin, a modern 
language, and Studio Art. All for less that the price of a single 
elective.</p>We will also be writing several unit studies, perfect for 
supplemental education of other curricula or summer education for 
traditional high schoolers. <br/><br/>Our Curriculum is:<br/><b>Versatile</b><br/>What we use to educate our children should not hinder our lives or their educational development. What we use to educate our children should conform to us, not make us conform to its needs.<br/><br/>The ease of digitized books, experiments based on household supplies, and harnessing verified internet sources means that you can easily educate your child from anywhere and at anytime. Schooling while traveling, moving often or repeatedly, living outside the radius of a library, or even missioning in remote ares will not hinder your child's education anymore. Our digital platform means no heavy instructor's guide to juggle, no workbooks to manage and no heavy books to lug around. Our instructor's guide comes in a downloadable file easily imported into your computer, laptop, iPad, Kindle, or other tablet. Everything you need fits into a single backpack!<br/><br/><b>Expressive</b><br/><p>As
 a student matures the ultimate goal is to inspire them to self 
education. Invoking and encouraging that passion to learn has no better 
vehicle than art. Artistic talent is not required.  Art has many facets 
that we see and use everyday in life without acknowledging the presence 
of the creativity that is a part of it. Any businessman can run a store,
 but an entrepreneur sees a new and creative opportunity that adds value
 to society. Any skilled tradesman can use tools and follow a plan, but a
 craftsman designs and creates new wonders that were never there before.
  </p>
<p>Art is the communication 
of information from your student to others. It is the expression of 
their thoughts and beliefs. It may be painted or drawn, but it can also 
be written, spoken, built, and carved. A student must be taught to 
express or communicate their thoughts. As your student moves through 
this curriculum, they will build an entire portfolio to express their 
passions and their ideas to future employers and universities.</p>
<p><b>Thought-Provoking </b><br/>There
 is more to an education than inspiring passion or the recitation of 
memorized facts. The goal of an education should be to learn the ability
 to coalesce information you've learned into a reasonable narrative and 
to spark the desire to learn more and dig deeper. In order to do that, 
an education must train a student in a critical and logical thought 
process. Using critical thought and logic trains a mind to explore and 
question the world and viewpoints around him. By doing this, the student
 grows and matures.</p>
<p>Lastly, an education must build an 
understanding of personal values.  Values may be different for many 
people for a number of reasons.  With this curriculum, we will ask 
questions that challenge a student. As a student processes challenging 
topics, they will grow and mature as a person which will be apparent in 
their portfolio. It also will spark some wonderful conversation and 
dialogue in the family.</p>Download a Free Sample <a href=""http://www.theartistichomeschooler.com/year8/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">HERE</a><br/><br/><br/><h3>Why Are We Crowdfunding?</h3>When we started to talk to other homeschooling parents (either actively schooling or looking at schooling), we realized that we were not the only ones who were looking for this answer.

<p><strong>Who We Are:</strong></p>
<p>My name is Brad Carr. I’m 32 years old. And I’m a professional baker. I have 9 years of restaurant experience, serving as both a cook and a pastry chef. I really enjoy the effort that goes into making delicious desserts and pastries. I’m passionate about using quality ingredients to create great tasting items from the bakeshop. My wife, Kim, is my partner.  She manages the bakery and does an awesome job. She has 8 years of experience in accounting and office management.</p>
<p>This campaign will not only help us reach our goal to have the funds necessary open our bakery, but will also help create awareness of who we are and why our bakery will be a great asset to our community. When you decide to contribute you’re not only helping us achieve our dreams but you’re helping us build a better city together. We are strongly involved in community events and want nothing more than to continue making Hartsville a great American city.</p>

<p><strong>What We Need:</strong></p>
<p>We are seeking $7500 in startup capital which will go towards the following:</p>
<p>We need $2500 for kitchen equipment: work tables, inventory racks, utensils, bowls, pans, and cooling racks.</p>
<p>We also need $2500 for front of the shop furnishings: tables, chairs, display cases, a drink case, a hot beverage station, coffee thermoses, and window displays and decor. </p>
<p>We will use $1500 to purchase packaging and service utensils: product boxes, box liners, paper bags, mugs, glasses, saucers, forks, spoons, and serving dishes. </p>
<p>The last $1000 will be used for promotional materials to help us get our name out into the community in the form of rack cards, business cards, t-shirts, hats, and decals. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Our most unique perk will be that our products will be baked fresh daily. We want to create an atmosphere of community and hometown pride. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Your Impact:</strong></p>
<p>It has been far too long since Hartsville has had a true hometown bakery. We are looking forward to sharing delicious mouth-watering desserts, fresh crusty breads, and gorgeous custom made cakes with our city. </p>
<p><strong>Our success so far:</strong></p>
<p>We are in the final stages of remodeling our build to better serve you! We are on the verge of opening, but we need your help to make the final push to meet our mark!

We have also completed the Business Builder Program of Hartsville. We are also a member of the Chamber of Commerce and MainStreet Hartsville.</p>
<p><strong>Challenges we face: </strong></p>
<p>We face the same challenges that any small startup business faces, however our team has plenty of experience in running small businesses. We have a combined 17 years of experience.

   Needs for us and Perks for you  We need $2,500 to cover the expenses for this first event. We are not charging the vendors a booth fee and for this reason, need help offsetting the cost. These funds will go towards helping us cover event essentials such as insurance permits, signage, music equipment, etc.  We are thrilled that we can offer all of our supporters the opportunity to help make this mission have global impact. We are 100% confirmed for this event, so any funds contributed to this endeavor will be used towards making it amazing.    Join the movement 

We see The Good Weekends as a movement. We believe that the majority of people want to make purchases from ethical brands and impact-driven companies, but many consumers don't know how to find these brands or learn about them. We want to change that.

Over the past six years we've slowly transformed a neglected Christmas tree planting into a productive and diverse farm.  We've grown the farm at a pace consistent with our financial capabilities and the pace of changes made by hand.  Now we are at the point of needing a way to cool and store the fruits and vegetables that we grow for our CSA program and local sales.  With your help we can build a root cellar and passive cooler to refrigerate our goods without electricity year round, using the insulating power of the earth and the abundant winter cold found here in Vermont.</span></h3><div>

<p>Each year the farm is increasing production as our gardens improve and perennial plantings of fruit crops come into maturity.  In order to meet the cooling needs of the farm and be able to offer a winter share of storage crops to our CSA we need a way of cooling our produce.  Many farms turn to a walk in cooler for this purpose. We'd like to try something different, and a little experimental, that operates without burning fossil fuels.  Root cellars have been used for thousands of years, and ice houses at least  a hundred, but both have their limitations.  <b>We'd like to take the principle of using earth as a constant insulator a step farther by adding tanks of water inside the cellar that will freeze during the cold months and slowly melt and cool the space in the summer months.  </b></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1454015706/ocexmrios36yoixsvhft.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>The root cellar will be a 16x16x8 foot poured cement foundation dug into a side hill.  The root cellar’s cooling time period will be expanded beyond the winter months with the addition of tanks of water inside the cellar that will freeze from the inside out when outside air temperatures are 31ºF or below, utilizing a passive heat exchange system of copper pipes filled with butane.  The frozen tanks will slowly melt during the warmer months, cooling an enclosed space within the cellar that can be used as a walk in cooler.  Once built, the passive cooler should continue to operate without the need for a power source, saving emissions and dollars. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1454025412/jzbyv1yia7bzvi1ttp8x.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h2>How The Passive Cooling Action Works</h2>
<p>Butane boils at 31ºF.  When the copper pipes containing butane are in contact with air or water that is above 31ºF, the butane will boil and become a gas that will rise to the top of the sealed pipe which is outside the root cellar.  If the temperature outside is below 31ºF the butane gas will condense back into a liquid and drop down to the bottom of the pipe array inside the water tank.  If the water in the tank is above 31ºF the butane will once again boil and condense, starting a cycle that will continue as long as the water temperature is above 31ºF and the outside air temperature below 31ºF.  Each time the butane is boiled by the water tank temperature, heat is transferred from the water, cooling, and eventually freezing the whole tank starting from the inside out.</p>

</div></div>","Peace of Earth is a small farm in Vermont's Northeast Kingdom. Over the past six years we've slowly transformed a neglected Christmas tree planting into a productive and diverse farm.  We've grown the farm at a pace consistent with our financial capabilities and the pace of changes made by hand.  Now we are at the point of needing a way to cool and store the fruits and vegetables that we grow for our CSA program and local sales.  With your help we can build a root cellar and passive cooler to refrigerate our goods without electricity year round, using the insulating power of the earth and the abundant winter cold found here in Vermont.


What We Need Your Help For
Each year the farm is increasing production as our gardens improve and perennial plantings of fruit crops come into maturity.  In order to meet the cooling needs of the farm and be able to offer a winter share of storage crops to our CSA we need a way of cooling our produce.  Many farms turn to a walk in cooler for this purpose. We'd like to try something different, and a little experimental, that operates without burning fossil fuels.  Root cellars have been used for thousands of years, and ice houses at least  a hundred, but both have their limitations.  We'd like to take the principle of using earth as a constant insulator a step farther by adding tanks of water inside the cellar that will freeze during the cold months and slowly melt and cool the space in the summer months.  

The root cellar will be a 16x16x8 foot poured cement foundation dug into a side hill.  The root cellar’s cooling time period will be expanded beyond the winter months with the addition of tanks of water inside the cellar that will freeze from the inside out when outside air temperatures are 31ºF or below, utilizing a passive heat exchange system of copper pipes filled with butane.  The frozen tanks will slowly melt during the warmer months, cooling an enclosed space within the cellar that can be used as a walk in cooler.  Once built, the passive cooler should continue to operate without the need for a power source, saving emissions and dollars. 

How The Passive Cooling Action Works
Butane boils at 31ºF.  When the copper pipes containing butane are in contact with air or water that is above 31ºF, the butane will boil and become a gas that will rise to the top of the sealed pipe which is outside the root cellar.  If the temperature outside is below 31ºF the butane gas will condense back into a liquid and drop down to the bottom of the pipe array inside the water tank.  If the water in the tank is above 31ºF the butane will once again boil and condense, starting a cycle that will continue as long as the water temperature is above 31ºF and the outside air temperature below 31ºF.  Each time the butane is boiled by the water tank temperature, heat is transferred from the water, cooling, and eventually freezing the whole tank starting from the inside out.

What we'll use the money for:
$7,000 16’x16’x8’ poured cement foundation with roof (labor and materials)
$2600 Excavation, gravel, trucking and drainage pipe
$1300 Construction details (Insulation, Ventilation, Shelving, Door, Interior wall)
$1100 Passive refrigeration units (4 water tanks, copper piping and fittings, butane)
-If we raise less than our goal we will still be able to move towards completion of the root cellar/passive cooler by scaling down the project, completing it in stages as finances allow, or using the money pledged as matching funds for further grant or loan requests
What's Growing at Peace of Earth Farm?


Rebecca, Jeffrey and the other animals on the farm have been doing the work of clearing, fertilizing, mulching, and planting a diverse array of plants and fungi to create our current farm community.   Instead of reacting to the challenges of farming with pesticides, we choose to maintain ecological diversity, keep the soil undisturbed and covered with mulch, and make sure that the proper nutrients are available for growing healthy resilient plants.  We grow a wide variety of vegetables, fruits, and herbs.  As well as pigs, chickens and ducks.  We are just in the beginning stages of growing shiitake mushrooms on logs.  In addition we operate an indoor shoot and sprout operation from our home, helping to create year round income and fresh green things available locally in the heart of winter.


We sell our produce through a CSA (Community Supported Agriculture) program as well as to stores and restaurants, mostly within 30 miles of the farm.  We'd love to be able to offer a winter CSA share with the storage capacity of a root cellar.



Your support of this project will help in 3 main ways

1. A small farm will receive a financial boost from the community, allowing us to grow as a business and provide more food locally
2. The local community will gain access to more high quality food in the form of a winter CSA share, fresh flats of raspberries, shiitakes, sprouts or lettuce....!

3.  The passive cooler concept is a new idea.  We are dedicated to keeping good records about how well it works.  We will adjust the amount of tanks or insulation as necessary and make the results known.  We would like this experiment to benefit other farms or individuals wishing to replicate it and will gladly share our data with school groups, tours, or others wishing to stay up to date via newsletter. Someone has to go out on a limb and experiment with new alternative technologies that companies are not likely to invest their dollars in.  This is grass roots research!

Bethlehem360° will contain photos and videos of historical, religious, and archeological sites that you will be able to control. From our tour, you can view the site you are interested in from any angle and get in depth as much as you wish. You will be able to rotate, zoom, and control the image using the keyboard, mouse, or touch screen. From this project, you will be able to visit any place in Bethlehem from anywhere in the world. You can discover Bethlehem from our 360 virtual tour as if you are actually here. If you haven't visited Bethlehem before, you will be able to now from our online tours. (Imagine a simulated reality of this holy city.)(This is a 360 video sample , you can move right, left, up and down)


The WHO and the WHATiFocus team brings a variety of experience and knowledge to the Virtual Tour. Our Team produces only the highest-quality virtual tours for a variety of industries. We utilize the latest high-tech equipment, combined with our team of photographers. Our virtual tours can be viewed on a variety of platforms from mobile devices, tablets, laptops and PCs. You can view our work by visiting these places below!                         solomon's pools                                                ST.saba monastery
                         Herod's mountain                                           Qruntol mountain                                               and there is #So_Much_more  ...

You will see that we have already filmed some of the most historical sites in this region but have not been able to continue and get you and our viewers further. This is why we need your help. We want to showcase and introduce Bethlehem to the world and deliver this holy city directly into your home. With just a click of the mouse, we want you to be able to experience everything Bethlehem has to offer. For example, viewers are able to enter the Manger Square and view the Church of the Nativity from the outside but are not able to enter inside the church and explore there. With your help, we can achieve this.



Our team wants to create tours of all the important sites in the city of Bethlehem, and each site has several points it needs filmed. In total, we need to film around 150 points which includes locations in and outside the area, street views, and different angles for a complete 360 experience.BETHLEHEM is the city where Christ was born. It is a city full of significance for millions of people worldwide. It is the center for culture and tourism and is only 10km south of Jerusalem, another very significant city for all people. People of Bethlehem rely heavily on tourism and our project will help bring people and businesses together from all over.  WHY we need YOUThe funding we are seeking here is to get us started. We want to start filming these locations right before and during spring time and it takes time, money, and man power to begin.-We need to provide food and transportation for five people during filming time which needs at least 2-3 months.-We also need to pay for entering these locations which can run up to $300 per day for just one site and on most occasions we need a couple of days for just one location due to tourist visits, closures, and time interference with other schedules.-We use one set of equipment to film but would need at least another to capture the material quicker and more vividly or we have to continue renting some of the equipment. We need a new camera, lens, head, and tripod.-Pay taxes to the Ministry of Tourism for filming-We need to pay for the photographer, design film maker, marketing agency and campaign writer.-Pay for marketing our campaign using Google AdWords and Facebook Ads.-And we need to finish and launch our website.So we have come here for people who are interested in this project and can help us create it. We want to be part of your world and invite you to ours.With your help, we will provide food and transportation for our crew, rent or preferably purchase equipment for filming and editing, pay for all the entrances for the locations and pay for permits to be allowed to film and display some of these sites. Your help will get us to start this project and allow us to work for the following months! Some of our lovely places you will enjoy as well!  THE PLANOnce our team gets the funding it needs, we will begin preparing ourselves and our equipment to begin. We will seek permits to film in the areas we have chosen, and once we pay for these permits, we will make schedules for each location biweekly. We plan to begin filming mid-March and end in May, with an extra month (June) for any corrections or last minute problems to solve.While filming, we will meet with hotels, restaurants, and souvenir shops and make connections with them in order to use them in our virtual tours. Our project, after the initial funding will sustain itself by advertising these businesses. With a special price and coding, customers will be even able to purchase items from souvenir shops or book hotel rooms via the virtual tour.At the same time, tourist agencies around the world and locally will have the option to purchase our packages to use for their agencies which will be specially designed for them. Our project will be able to sustain itself but we need the jump start! We need your help to start us off!Other Ways you can Help!Most importantly, give whatever you can to the campaign. Many small donations will add up and help us stay relevant online.In addition to that, you can always, and please do, share share SHARE!· Spread the word: Share this campaign on Facebook and Twitter, or tell your friends in an email.· Stay connected: Follow our Facebook page for updates and easy sharing!For daily updates follow our social media accounts!

Besides that we already employ one man as a gardner and night guard and we can imagine we, at one point, when the business is thriving, we have jobs for other local people.

<p>I have been in the business of graphic design and printing for
many years, and not a moment has passed where I was not striving to provide the
best service and experience to my customers. I always aim to go the extra mile.
From this, my company Atuahene Designs was born, and has become my pride and
joy. I am able to focus my efforts on making sure that I am not only doing what
I love, but bringing persons’ ideas and designs to life in a colorful and
unique way. </p>
<p>Atuahene Designs is my main source of income, and therefore
what I use to provide for myself and my family. It is important to me in more
ways than one, and to lose it would be devastating. I have scraped and saved
many times in order to invest in growing the business, but each time,
emergencies and unforeseen circumstances keep popping up, leaving me no choice
but to tap into my savings. This has happened at least three times, and I am at
the point where if my business does not grow, it will fall under, but I refuse
to withhold finances at the cost of helping my family. They mean the world to
me.</p>
<p>This is why I have decided to try and seek funding in order to
get Atuahene Designs to the next level.</p>
<p>Presently, I am seeking $10,000 in donations in order to purchase
some necessary machines and software for the business, and to register the
company. Some of the items I would like to invest in include graphic design
programs, a new desktop computer, papers, a hard drive, and accounting
software. With this expansion I would not only be able to provide better and
faster service for my customers, but grow the business to a sustainable size,
that will allow it to take on bigger and better contracts.</p>
<p>To those who donate, I thank you for your generosity, and am
more than willing to offer my services in order to show my gratitude. If you
check out the reward tier, you will see what I will offer to donors at various
levels. Every dollar counts, and even if you cannot donate this time, sharing
my campaign on social media would go a long way in helping to spread the word.</p>
<p>I am still working hard to save money towards the company,
because I believe in this venture. Please help me to keep it afloat.</p>

I am is committed to strengthening my local community.
Throughout my culinary career, I has been an advocate for
environmental issues, culinary arts and grassroots community outreach. Through
Food for Thought by the Sea, I am able to incorporate my passion for
charitable work and outreach into a non-profit organization. 
Just one of many
ongoing initiatives, Food for Thought by the Sea’s Community Table has fed more
than 10,000 hungry neighbors on Thanksgiving, Christmas and Easter. In
addition, it helped provide local restaurants and community members in Asbury
Park with fresh produce and goods at the Carousel Farmers Market, and is and
acts as a platform for local youth to pursue interests in horticulture, the
culinary arts and water sports.
Food for Thought by Sea's continued goal is
to strengthen Asbury Park through positive community outreach and
youth-empowerment programs.  Some past
and current programs include:
·  Free Summer Surf Lessons with the Boys and Girls Club
and Asbury Park Recreation Department
·  Free art music and gardening program with the Boys and
Girls Club
·  Support of the Kula Garden project in affiliation with
the Kula Café in Asbury Park
·  Carousel Farmer’s Market in Asbury Park
·  Free community dinners at Langosta Lounge in Asbury
Park on Thanksgiving, Christmas and Easter.
The Food Truck will also cooperate with the Food For Thought program to help engage the community youth with similar programs!

We are Anand and Chef Mason of WholeWay Home, in Las Vegas, NV. We have been teaching people how to make their own RAW chocolate for a several years now. This June we are pleased to be presenting at the Health-Healing-Happiness Conference and Expo! Over 1000 people are expected at this year's event!!!  
To top it off, we want to throw an after party that features not just ordinary chocolate... but one that focuses on RAW and vegan and Organic Chocolate, PLUS all the other things that make it swing! Like CHAGA! MACA! MAGIC! Music! Mocktails! and MORE!!! We're calling it the RAWket Chocolate Frolic!
There are some actual hard costs to throwing an awesome party. More Cash = EPIC Bash. ALL PROCEEDS go towards party planning. 




 Why Cacao? Why Frolic? 
Are you wanting, needing, waiting, yearning, burning for chocolates? Justify your LOVE of Chocolate. Chocolate heals your heart! …and boosts LOVE CONNECTIONS! When you eat RAW VEGAN CHOCOLATE ~ it can increase regular dark chocolate health benefits up to 20 times! It’s low-glycemic, raw, gluten-free, vegan and gourmet. 
Why NOT Frolic?!?!
--------------------------------------------------------------

    Party with REAL Impact! A spoonful of sugar makes the medicine go down. When folks who are not vegetarian or vegan (yet) see how much fun and delicious raw vegan chocolate is - they just might start thinking about changing their diets!


Get people to be Vegan-curious! Expose folks to raw, living and minimally processed foods in a light-hearted and playful accessible manner! 

Let Loose with the Juice! Give people the opportunity to let loose and have a blast without feeling the overwhelming pressure to drink or consume harmful “Sin City” substances. By offering unique interesting elixirs to imbibe that will raise spirits – we WILL raise consciousness!

Transform lives! Your hosts have produced numerous fun events before. They know how to get people to interact and open up to once-in-lifetime experiences and good times - that subtly transform lives...

   Challenges and the VISION to achieve  Here are the risks and obstacles to achieving our goal.
People  Sponsors with healthy versions of chocolate (and related products) who want to access ""Product Influencers"" in a great setting where they can engage consumers for life.
Professional DJ with  sound system and setup.

<p>The principal goal of this campaign is to give a home to Alpha Shape. A place where we can give fitness classes and nutrition coaching with the philosophy of “Pay as you Train”. We already identified the ideal place and you can have a glance on the picture below.<br/></p>

<p>But as excited as we are, our dream has become more expensive than anticipated and we are reaching out to our community to help us push through. Our ideal project would require 100 000. However, for the moment our goal is to at least get into action. Because our clients, our team and our idea needs a home. We hope to raise 35 000 and the money raised on Indiegogo will help us:</p>
<ol>
<li>With the deposit required by the city of Montreal of 15,000$, this is not even taking in consideration the permit fee</li>
<li>Then we have Basic renovations: 6000$</li>
<li>The fitness equipment: 9000$</li>
<li>Media and computer system: 1000$</li>
<li>And the follow up and coaching app:  4000$. This will be a way to connect and engage even more with our clients.

</div></div>","This impacts those who have obesity, their families, employers,
neighbours, health practitioners and governments. 
We found ourselves in the public parks of Montreal working out with a surprisingly high number of other MontrealersWith the only goal of helping more people reaching their health goals
 and particularly those who can't afford or don't like gyms, we 
organized workouts and bootcamps in the public parks of Montreal and the
 number started growing rapidly.
No equipment was necessary, just bars, benches and our body weight. 
The more we continued the more the numbers grew … until winter.  We 
started to think about creating a place to welcome the community that we
 spent the summer creating.

In the parks it was always free so it was open to everyone. However, 
it was a bit complicated to keep it going all year, especially when the 
winter arrived.
Right now we operate from a small office, that we share with other 
coaches and we mainly use it for consultations. And it became very 
complicated to give the necessary fitness support to our clients. It 
became obvious to us that we had to level up the standards of our 
service.What we have noticed:

The principal goal of this campaign is to give a home to Alpha Shape. A place where we can give fitness classes and nutrition coaching with the philosophy of “Pay as you Train”. We already identified the ideal place and you can have a glance on the picture below.



But as excited as we are, our dream has become more expensive than anticipated and we are reaching out to our community to help us push through. Our ideal project would require 100 000. However, for the moment our goal is to at least get into action. Because our clients, our team and our idea needs a home. We hope to raise 35 000 and the money raised on Indiegogo will help us:

With the deposit required by the city of Montreal of 15,000$, this is not even taking in consideration the permit fee
Then we have Basic renovations: 6000$
The fitness equipment: 9000$
Media and computer system: 1000$
And the follow up and coaching app:  4000$. This will be a way to connect and engage even more with our clients.

accessories made from the roots of Vetiver, a medicinal plant.</b></h1>
<p>Vetiver is a kind of grass mainly available in
eastern and western part of India. This grass can grow up to 150 centimeters (5
ft) high and form clumps as wide. The stems are tall and the leaves are long,
thin, and rather rigid. The flowers are brownish-purple. Unlike most grasses,
which form horizontally spreading, mat-like root systems, Vetiver's roots grow
downward, 2 meters (7 ft) to 4 meters (13 ft) in depth. </p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1457105724/fudglsfbxyczhnhsnizv.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/>
<p>The Vetiver bunch grass has a gregarious habit
and grows in tufts. Shoots growing from the underground crown make the plant
frost and wildfire resistant, and allow it to survive heavy grazing pressure.
The leaves can become up to 150 centimeters (5 ft) long and 8 millimeters (0.3
in) wide.[3] The panicles are 15 centimeters (6 in) to 30 centimeters (12 in)
long and have whorled, 25 millimeters (1 in) to 50 millimeters (2 in) long
branches.[3] The spikelets are in pairs, and there are three stamens.</p>
<p>The plant stems are erect and stiff. They can
persist deep water flow. Under clear water, the plant can survive up to two
months.</p>
<p>The root system of Vetiver is finely structured
and very strong. It can grow 3 meters (10 ft) to 4 meters (13 ft) deep within
the first year. Vetiver has no stolons nor rhizomes. Because of all these
characteristics, the Vetiver plant is highly drought-tolerant and can help to
protect soil against sheet erosion. In case of sediment deposition, new roots
can grow out of buried nodes.</p>
<h2>Herbal skin care use</h2>
<p>Vetiver in recent years have been used to produce
perfumes, creams and soaps. It is used for its antiseptic properties to treat
acne and sores.</p>
<p>Several aspects of Vetiver make it an excellent
erosion control plant in warmer climates. </p>
<p>Strong root: Vetiver does not form a
horizontal mat of roots; rather, the roots grow almost exclusively downward, 2
meters (7 ft) to 4 meters (13 ft), which is deeper than some tree roots.</p>
<p>This makes Vetiver an excellent stabilizing hedge for stream banks,
terraces, and rice paddies, and protects soil from sheet erosion. The roots
bind to the soil, therefore it can not dislodge. Vetiver has also been used to
stabilize railway cuttings/embankments in geologically challenging situations
in an attempt to prevent mudslides and rockfalls, the Konkan railway in Western
India being an example. The plant also penetrates and loosens compacted soils.</p>
<p>Vetiver is mainly cultivated for the fragrant
essential oil distilled from its roots. In perfumery, the older French
spelling, Vetiver, is often used. Worldwide production is estimated at about
250 tons per annum. Due to its
excellent fixative properties, Vetiver is used widely in perfumes. It is
contained in 90% of all western perfumes. Vetiver is a more common ingredient
in fragrances for men; some notable examples include Dior's Eau Sauvage,
Guerlain Vetiver, Mr. Vetiver by Une Nuit a Bali, Zizan by Ormonde Jayne and
Vetiver by L'Occitane.</p>
<p>Vetiver 
is also used as a flavoring agent.</p>
<p>The United States, Europe, India, and Japan are
the main consumers.</p>
<p>.</p>
<h2>In-house use</h2>
<p>In the Indian Subcontinent, Khus (vetiver roots)
is often used to replace the straw or wood shaving pads in evaporative
coolers.[3] When cool water runs for months over wood shavings in evaporative
cooler padding, they tend to accumulate algae, bacteria and other
microorganisms. This causes the cooler to emit a fishy or seaweed smell into
the house. Vetiver root padding counteracts this smell. A cheaper alternative
is to add Vetiver cooler perfume or even pure Khus attar to the tank. Another
advantage is that they do not catch fire as easily as dry wood shavings.</p>
<p>In the hot summer months in India, sometimes a
muslin sachet of vetiver roots is tossed into the earthen pot that keeps a
household's drinking water cool. Like a bouquet garni, the bundle lends
distinctive flavor and aroma to the water.</p>
<h2>Medicinal use</h2>
<p>Vetiver has been used in traditional medicine in
South Asia (India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka), Southeast Asia(Malaysia, Indonesia,
Thailand), and West Africa.</p>
<p>Old Tamil literature mentions the use of Vetiver
for medical purposes</p>
<p><b>More over the Vetiver routs have

<p><br/></p><p></p></div>","Nature's best home decors and
accessories made from the roots of Vetiver, a medicinal plant.
Vetiver is a kind of grass mainly available in
eastern and western part of India. This grass can grow up to 150 centimeters (5
ft) high and form clumps as wide. The stems are tall and the leaves are long,
thin, and rather rigid. The flowers are brownish-purple. Unlike most grasses,
which form horizontally spreading, mat-like root systems, Vetiver's roots grow
downward, 2 meters (7 ft) to 4 meters (13 ft) in depth. 
The Vetiver bunch grass has a gregarious habit
and grows in tufts. Shoots growing from the underground crown make the plant
frost and wildfire resistant, and allow it to survive heavy grazing pressure.
The leaves can become up to 150 centimeters (5 ft) long and 8 millimeters (0.3
in) wide.[3] The panicles are 15 centimeters (6 in) to 30 centimeters (12 in)
long and have whorled, 25 millimeters (1 in) to 50 millimeters (2 in) long
branches.[3] The spikelets are in pairs, and there are three stamens.
The plant stems are erect and stiff. They can
persist deep water flow. Under clear water, the plant can survive up to two
months.
The root system of Vetiver is finely structured
and very strong. It can grow 3 meters (10 ft) to 4 meters (13 ft) deep within
the first year. Vetiver has no stolons nor rhizomes. Because of all these
characteristics, the Vetiver plant is highly drought-tolerant and can help to
protect soil against sheet erosion. In case of sediment deposition, new roots
can grow out of buried nodes.
Herbal skin care use
Vetiver in recent years have been used to produce
perfumes, creams and soaps. It is used for its antiseptic properties to treat
acne and sores.
Several aspects of Vetiver make it an excellent
erosion control plant in warmer climates. 
Strong root: Vetiver does not form a
horizontal mat of roots; rather, the roots grow almost exclusively downward, 2
meters (7 ft) to 4 meters (13 ft), which is deeper than some tree roots.
This makes Vetiver an excellent stabilizing hedge for stream banks,
terraces, and rice paddies, and protects soil from sheet erosion. The roots
bind to the soil, therefore it can not dislodge. Vetiver has also been used to
stabilize railway cuttings/embankments in geologically challenging situations
in an attempt to prevent mudslides and rockfalls, the Konkan railway in Western
India being an example. The plant also penetrates and loosens compacted soils.
Vetiver is mainly cultivated for the fragrant
essential oil distilled from its roots. In perfumery, the older French
spelling, Vetiver, is often used. Worldwide production is estimated at about
250 tons per annum. Due to its
excellent fixative properties, Vetiver is used widely in perfumes. It is
contained in 90% of all western perfumes. Vetiver is a more common ingredient
in fragrances for men; some notable examples include Dior's Eau Sauvage,
Guerlain Vetiver, Mr. Vetiver by Une Nuit a Bali, Zizan by Ormonde Jayne and
Vetiver by L'Occitane.
Vetiver 
is also used as a flavoring agent.
The United States, Europe, India, and Japan are
the main consumers.
.
In-house use
In the Indian Subcontinent, Khus (vetiver roots)
is often used to replace the straw or wood shaving pads in evaporative
coolers.[3] When cool water runs for months over wood shavings in evaporative
cooler padding, they tend to accumulate algae, bacteria and other
microorganisms. This causes the cooler to emit a fishy or seaweed smell into
the house. Vetiver root padding counteracts this smell. A cheaper alternative
is to add Vetiver cooler perfume or even pure Khus attar to the tank. Another
advantage is that they do not catch fire as easily as dry wood shavings.
In the hot summer months in India, sometimes a
muslin sachet of vetiver roots is tossed into the earthen pot that keeps a
household's drinking water cool. Like a bouquet garni, the bundle lends
distinctive flavor and aroma to the water.
Medicinal use
Vetiver has been used in traditional medicine in
South Asia (India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka), Southeast Asia(Malaysia, Indonesia,
Thailand), and West Africa.
Old Tamil literature mentions the use of Vetiver
for medical purposes
More over the Vetiver routs have
fibrous properties so here we are introducing attractive handicrafts for your show case.
Beautifully made boat and house will be a main
attraction of your show case or at working place.

<p>I want to bring Chicago (Wicker Park/ Ukrainian Village/ West Town/ Bucktown area) an old-fashioned general store where neighbors can get away from modern times and discover goods crafted by hand by people who take pride in their work!</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1481935777/n6mzmv6jah5fmtsght08.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<ul>
<li>But me, I've been a lowly shop girl for 20-something years. I live paycheck-to-paycheck. I know that it takes some time to grow a business properly and I don't have the means to support it in the start-up phase . I need YOU!</li>
<li>I've got a business plan to share but also put together a temporary storefront to bring to life a mini-version of my vision. Please watch the video to get the idea ~ sorry I couldn't capture how AMAZING it smells in here!!!</li>
<li>Backing this store is backing my dream to do GREAT THINGS through COMMERCE! I want to create an environment that is FUN and REWARDING to work in, that is GRATIFYING to shop in, and which supports American makers and heartwarming causes WORLD-WIDE!</li>
</ul>
<p><i>I'd like to inspire &amp; propel good deeds through local commerce! </i></p>
<p><i><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1482432903/zoaaptjiseuhkjjvzxf8.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></i></p>

<h3>It's a great idea, right?!? But I need proper capital!</h3>
<p>We've had encouraging feedback from neighbors during the pop-up shop on Division St. I'm confident that this concept can indeed grow and become a stop that the West Town/ Wicker Park/ Ukrainian Village communities will be very fond of. In fact, I can envision a growth stage where we'll be able to grow roots in other communities as well one day! However, it really takes time and patience and a lot of energy to get a small business its legs. I want to be sure that it has what it needs to grow. To have the capital to sustain a year's expenses would give it a really strong shot. This campaign is intended to begin that fund and hopefully also to reach some people who can back it at a larger contribution (be a financial partner!).  I'd love for you to be a part of it!</p>
<ul>
<li>Capital raised will allow this concept to find a spot to grow roots. I'll be looking for a corner storefront (1000-1500sf) somewhere within the West Town, Wicker Park, and Ukrainian Village neighborhoods. The goal is to raise enough to give this a go in Spring 2017.</li>
<li>If you're chipping in at a rate which gets you product perks, you're in for a treat! I've used many of these brands for years and I absolutely love them. Ask me about them if you'd like when you're choosing your reward. And~ as we've extended the pop-up shop through January 29th ~ you can even claim your credit immediately by shopping in store at 2124 w Division!</li>
<li>This is a business model for a community general store and YOU are part of this community! This will be a venue for young and old, for positive thought and ideas, for strengthening the identity of the neighborhood. Symbolically, you can contribute at a rate which earns you to literally etch your name into our business! The aesthetic will have lots of weathered wood as a general store would have in the 1880s. You'll be able to carve your name into a board when we open! You can also get a lifetime employee discount or even share a special cause which we'll promote and contribute to!</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Is it a good guess...</h3>
<p>to say that you've spent a little time feeling blue about some people not being as kind or as considerate or as responsible and careful of others and Earth??? It so happens that I organized and executed the pop-up shop version of this concept in a time of strong emotions and feelings of despair all around me.  I am so thankful for the experience of learning so many good things that makers and organizations are doing to fight for our resources and to leave positive footprints. Keep your chin up and be part of solutions!  :</p>
<ul>
<li>Help craftspeople find new audiences for their quality goods.</li>
<li>Keep vibrant small business sectors in neighborhoods.</li>
<li>Communicate ways to produce with clean energy, with fair labor practices, and with renewable resources.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>It won't be easy!</h3>
<p>I know this well! I've had a small business before back in 2001-2002. I ran the pop-up shop while working a full time job (couldn't have done it without a fabulous team~~whoot!) I've seen many businesses lately struggle and fold. Yet still, there are businesses in similar neighborhoods with similar values which sustain and persevere. Through observation and interaction that I've had with neighbors and other business owners during the pop-up event, I know that this concept can thrive here in time.  But it needs essentials to do this: financial support, a caring eye, and patience. I've got two-thirds of the ingredients.</p>
<ul>
<li>I started my retail career at  Kline's -a small, family-owned department store in Chicago Heights, Illinois. I'm sure that is where I got my business values. Seeking great, quality brands is what they did. Listening to the customer brought them pleasure. Enjoying connection to community and individuals made them a destination for generations. I've worked for a regional dept. store ~Carson's~ over 20 years cumulatively. I've also worked for Mark Shale, Marshall Field's, and Museum Company. I've worked in merchandising for Phillips Van Heusen, Haggar, and Sarah Lee. I've had a vintage shop (fun, costume-y stuff from the 60s-80s mostly) in Bucktown (Phoenix Retro Resale).  I've studied Retail at Syracuse University and I've studied Marketing at University of Illinois at Chicago. I've picked up a little bit (and sometimes a lot) at each of these stops. I'm eager to take all of that and turn it into something that really elevates the shopping experience into something that does the heart good.</li>
<li>I'm a frugal-by-nature person. But, I know that sometimes you have to put your nose out there more than is comfortable. I don't want to see this idea fail because it didn't have enough in the bank to get through the start-up phase. I will take the capital raised and continue to watch for ways to improve and to think on those things and try and regroup and react and brainstorm and press until this works as long as there is a dime in the bank.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Pockets empty?</h3>
<p>I can relate!! Even $5 or $10 helps a LOT in giving the campaign more momentum. If not, you can still show support by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sharing this effort with family, coworkers, neighbors, and friends! Tell them about it in person, too!</li>
<li>Use the Indiegogo sharing tools! </li>
<li>Check out the Instagram &amp; Facebook pages! There are many videos on the Facebook page for the causes that our brands named to give back to. I love to watch them. It might be a good way to start your day. Get inspired. Spread the love. (<a href=""http://facebook.com/EvilEyePopUp"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.facebook.com/EvilEyePopUp</a>)</li>
<li>Check out our website ~ <a href=""http://EvilEyeMercantile.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.EvilEyeMercantile.com</a>! You'll still be able to shop there while I'm trying to raise funds for the brick-and-mortar space &amp; there will be updates there, too!</li>
<li>If you would like to contribute as a financial partner, please get in touch directly. There is a 6% loan + 5 year/ 1% net profit structure for shares at $5,000 currently set up and I'm very interested in bringing more great minds to this team.</li>
</ul>

Step into the past & look to the future! 
I want to bring Chicago (Wicker Park/ Ukrainian Village/ West Town/ Bucktown area) an old-fashioned general store where neighbors can get away from modern times and discover goods crafted by hand by people who take pride in their work!
 


But me, I've been a lowly shop girl for 20-something years. I live paycheck-to-paycheck. I know that it takes some time to grow a business properly and I don't have the means to support it in the start-up phase . I need YOU!
I've got a business plan to share but also put together a temporary storefront to bring to life a mini-version of my vision. Please watch the video to get the idea ~ sorry I couldn't capture how AMAZING it smells in here!!!
Backing this store is backing my dream to do GREAT THINGS through COMMERCE! I want to create an environment that is FUN and REWARDING to work in, that is GRATIFYING to shop in, and which supports American makers and heartwarming causes WORLD-WIDE!

I'd like to inspire & propel good deeds through local commerce! 


It's a great idea, right?!? But I need proper capital!
We've had encouraging feedback from neighbors during the pop-up shop on Division St. I'm confident that this concept can indeed grow and become a stop that the West Town/ Wicker Park/ Ukrainian Village communities will be very fond of. In fact, I can envision a growth stage where we'll be able to grow roots in other communities as well one day! However, it really takes time and patience and a lot of energy to get a small business its legs. I want to be sure that it has what it needs to grow. To have the capital to sustain a year's expenses would give it a really strong shot. This campaign is intended to begin that fund and hopefully also to reach some people who can back it at a larger contribution (be a financial partner!).  I'd love for you to be a part of it!

Capital raised will allow this concept to find a spot to grow roots. I'll be looking for a corner storefront (1000-1500sf) somewhere within the West Town, Wicker Park, and Ukrainian Village neighborhoods. The goal is to raise enough to give this a go in Spring 2017.
If you're chipping in at a rate which gets you product perks, you're in for a treat! I've used many of these brands for years and I absolutely love them. Ask me about them if you'd like when you're choosing your reward. And~ as we've extended the pop-up shop through January 29th ~ you can even claim your credit immediately by shopping in store at 2124 w Division!
This is a business model for a community general store and YOU are part of this community! This will be a venue for young and old, for positive thought and ideas, for strengthening the identity of the neighborhood. Symbolically, you can contribute at a rate which earns you to literally etch your name into our business! The aesthetic will have lots of weathered wood as a general store would have in the 1880s. You'll be able to carve your name into a board when we open! You can also get a lifetime employee discount or even share a special cause which we'll promote and contribute to!


Is it a good guess...
to say that you've spent a little time feeling blue about some people not being as kind or as considerate or as responsible and careful of others and Earth??? It so happens that I organized and executed the pop-up shop version of this concept in a time of strong emotions and feelings of despair all around me.  I am so thankful for the experience of learning so many good things that makers and organizations are doing to fight for our resources and to leave positive footprints. Keep your chin up and be part of solutions!  :

Help craftspeople find new audiences for their quality goods.
Keep vibrant small business sectors in neighborhoods.
Communicate ways to produce with clean energy, with fair labor practices, and with renewable resources.


It won't be easy!
I know this well! I've had a small business before back in 2001-2002. I ran the pop-up shop while working a full time job (couldn't have done it without a fabulous team~~whoot!) I've seen many businesses lately struggle and fold. Yet still, there are businesses in similar neighborhoods with similar values which sustain and persevere. Through observation and interaction that I've had with neighbors and other business owners during the pop-up event, I know that this concept can thrive here in time.  But it needs essentials to do this: financial support, a caring eye, and patience. I've got two-thirds of the ingredients.

I started my retail career at  Kline's -a small, family-owned department store in Chicago Heights, Illinois. I'm sure that is where I got my business values. Seeking great, quality brands is what they did. Listening to the customer brought them pleasure. Enjoying connection to community and individuals made them a destination for generations. I've worked for a regional dept. store ~Carson's~ over 20 years cumulatively. I've also worked for Mark Shale, Marshall Field's, and Museum Company. I've worked in merchandising for Phillips Van Heusen, Haggar, and Sarah Lee. I've had a vintage shop (fun, costume-y stuff from the 60s-80s mostly) in Bucktown (Phoenix Retro Resale).  I've studied Retail at Syracuse University and I've studied Marketing at University of Illinois at Chicago. I've picked up a little bit (and sometimes a lot) at each of these stops. I'm eager to take all of that and turn it into something that really elevates the shopping experience into something that does the heart good.
I'm a frugal-by-nature person. But, I know that sometimes you have to put your nose out there more than is comfortable. I don't want to see this idea fail because it didn't have enough in the bank to get through the start-up phase. I will take the capital raised and continue to watch for ways to improve and to think on those things and try and regroup and react and brainstorm and press until this works as long as there is a dime in the bank.


Pockets empty?
I can relate!! Even $5 or $10 helps a LOT in giving the campaign more momentum. If not, you can still show support by:

Sharing this effort with family, coworkers, neighbors, and friends! Tell them about it in person, too!
Use the Indiegogo sharing tools! 
Check out the Instagram & Facebook pages! There are many videos on the Facebook page for the causes that our brands named to give back to. I love to watch them. It might be a good way to start your day. Get inspired. Spread the love. (www.facebook.com/EvilEyePopUp)
Check out our website ~ www.EvilEyeMercantile.com! You'll still be able to shop there while I'm trying to raise funds for the brick-and-mortar space & there will be updates there, too!
If you would like to contribute as a financial partner, please get in touch directly. There is a 6% loan + 5 year/ 1% net profit structure for shares at $5,000 currently set up and I'm very interested in bringing more great minds to this team.

Thanks reading & listening. Please pitch in how ever you can so that this can happen!!

</div> <div> <h3></h3>
<p><b>How Did We Get That Name?</b></p>
<p>We named our farm “Mad Lavender” as a nod to Lewis Carroll. It reminds us to always inject a dose of fun and frabjousity into our creations on the farm. A good example is our “Flowering Dome”, an 18 foot high geodesic stainless steel dome donated to the farm this year by our friends Eric &amp; Grace Fiorito. To complete our vision, by Summer 2016, the dome will covered with a mass of flowering vines and the interior will be outfitted with reclaimed pallet furniture and homemade cushions. Imagine sitting in the shade of fragrant blossoms having a Mad Lavender Tea Party under a geodesic dome in the middle of July!</p>
<p><b>How Did We Get Here?</b></p>
<p>In 2012, the future of our family's 10 acre farm came into question. Once a popular “pick your own raspberry” farm, my father’s crop was demolished by the ever increasing deer population. In order to preserve our farm, and to continue to maintain our farm tax assessment, we needed to find a deer resistant crop. Then we discovered Lavender. The more we learned the more enchanted we became with Lavender for it's beauty, variety, healthful properties and resilience. We decided that we would be lavender farmers.</p> </div> <div> <h3></h3>
</div><p><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Building Community</b><br/></p><p> There is a bit of magic in the lavender; walking the labyrinth, picking bouquets or gathered around the cauldron burning lavender stems. The heart begins to open, the mind finds clarity. There's a bit of magic, too, when people discover common ground. Perhaps it's in a sense of play, sharing resources, solving problems together, finding a sense of belonging or a new level of empathy. <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">The community experience is what brings Mad Lavender Farm to life. </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">We want to continue to build Mad Lavender Farm to serve our community in a way that is  satisfying, educational, entertaining and accessible. </span></p><p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""></span></p><p><b>Risks &amp; Challenges</b></p>
<p>Our first attempt to raise lavender in 2013 was disastrous. We invested in 300 plants and we lost nearly the entire crop to a devastating winter. By the following winter, we were ready. With sufficient research and better support, we grew healthier plants, better varieties and they came through another bitter cold winter no problem. We continue to remain teachable and open to new ideas. A sustainable farm is one that supports diversity, a vision for the future and a respect for the wisdom of experienced elders. </p><p></p><p><b>How You Can Help (even if you can’t donate money)</b></p><p>If you are  excited about our vision, please share our campaign with your friends on social media. </p><p>If you know of a used Yurt in the tri state area, please let us know about it. </p><p>A temporary goat hut would come in handy, too.</p>Give us a call if you’re local and would like to lend a hand on the farm for a couple of hours.

Constructing the Geodesic Dome (a four person project!)   

                                                                                                                            

  
How Did We Get That Name?
We named our farm “Mad Lavender” as a nod to Lewis Carroll. It reminds us to always inject a dose of fun and frabjousity into our creations on the farm. A good example is our “Flowering Dome”, an 18 foot high geodesic stainless steel dome donated to the farm this year by our friends Eric & Grace Fiorito. To complete our vision, by Summer 2016, the dome will covered with a mass of flowering vines and the interior will be outfitted with reclaimed pallet furniture and homemade cushions. Imagine sitting in the shade of fragrant blossoms having a Mad Lavender Tea Party under a geodesic dome in the middle of July!
How Did We Get Here?
In 2012, the future of our family's 10 acre farm came into question. Once a popular “pick your own raspberry” farm, my father’s crop was demolished by the ever increasing deer population. In order to preserve our farm, and to continue to maintain our farm tax assessment, we needed to find a deer resistant crop. Then we discovered Lavender. The more we learned the more enchanted we became with Lavender for it's beauty, variety, healthful properties and resilience. We decided that we would be lavender farmers.   
Building Community There is a bit of magic in the lavender; walking the labyrinth, picking bouquets or gathered around the cauldron burning lavender stems. The heart begins to open, the mind finds clarity. There's a bit of magic, too, when people discover common ground. Perhaps it's in a sense of play, sharing resources, solving problems together, finding a sense of belonging or a new level of empathy. The community experience is what brings Mad Lavender Farm to life. We want to continue to build Mad Lavender Farm to serve our community in a way that is  satisfying, educational, entertaining and accessible. Risks & Challenges
Our first attempt to raise lavender in 2013 was disastrous. We invested in 300 plants and we lost nearly the entire crop to a devastating winter. By the following winter, we were ready. With sufficient research and better support, we grew healthier plants, better varieties and they came through another bitter cold winter no problem. We continue to remain teachable and open to new ideas. A sustainable farm is one that supports diversity, a vision for the future and a respect for the wisdom of experienced elders. How You Can Help (even if you can’t donate money)If you are  excited about our vision, please share our campaign with your friends on social media. If you know of a used Yurt in the tri state area, please let us know about it. A temporary goat hut would come in handy, too.Give us a call if you’re local and would like to lend a hand on the farm for a couple of hours. We feed our helpers very well!Don building our Gypsy Caravan coop (with a cement floor to protect our hens from predators).Adrienne's high brow damask stencil design to decorate the caravan.Voila!

<h3><u>About</u></h3>

<p>My name is Morgan Davis. I'm a graphic designer, fashion designer, photographer, proud graduate of Howard University, and the founder + CEO of Distinctly Creative. I founded Distinctly Creative in the Winter of 2015 because I wanted to create a safe space + community for black creative entrepreneurs to grow professionally &amp; personally. In addition, I wanted to help further push the narrative that we as black people, black creatives all deserve a seat at the table.</p>
<p>What started as an Instagram page highlighting various black creatives turned into events, the Black Creatives Matter apparel line, the DMV Black Creatives Directory, an online learning platform, and so much more.</p>
<p>Currently, Distinctly Creative is located in a small studio space in Brentwood, MD. This space functions as an event space that's available to rent for a variety of creative events, and a rotating gallery space featuring work by local black creatives. </p>
<p><strong>In November of this year, Distinctly Creative will be moving to a 3000+ sq ft coworking + maker space in Suitland, MD. This space will allow us to further implement our mission of advocating &amp; supporting for black creatives by opening a space that is catered towards helping creative entrepreneurs succeed. </strong></p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3><u>What's a coworking + makerspace &amp; why? </u></h3>
<p>A coworking space is a collaborative, shared workspace where entrepreneurs and business professionals are able to work amongst other like-minded individuals. A makerspace is a collaborative workspace that unlike a coworking space provides members access to a variety of maker equipment. </p>
<p>Coworking + makerspaces are not only a cost-effective option towards having access to professional level tools, but they also help establish a sense of community.</p>
<p>When you give creatives a space to create so many amazing things can happen between networking, economic empowerment, and community building which are things that are so needed, especially in Southern Maryland -- where there are very few spaces that are focused on entrepreneurs in general -- especially black creative entrepreneurs. </p>
<p>Our new space will be able to provide the tools, resources, education, and community for creative entrepreneurs of a variety of mediums &amp; skill levels -- in an atmosphere that not only promotes creativity + innovation, but does so in a way where it’s also providing a welcoming environment for black creatives &amp; the overall community.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><u>What will the space look like + where will it be located? </u></h3>
<p>Our new coworking + makerspace will be located in Suitland, Maryland next to the Branch Avenue Metro Station. The space is 3,000+ square feet and will include access to the following:</p>
<ul>

<li>Sewing Machines + Sergers</li>
<li>Embroidery Machines</li>

<p>----</p>
<p>""Distinctly Creative has been crucial to my evolution as a creative and building my network of like-minded black creatives.

<h3><u>Why your contribution matters. </u></h3>
<p>Here's why we think it's worth it help us open our space:</p>
<ul>
<li>Our space will create jobs by employing creatives to teach classes, and curate exhibits. We also provide free monthly opportunities for members to vend/sell their products &amp; services to the overall community. </li>
<li>Our space will help make having access to professional creative equipment easier for those in the DMV -- especially in Southern Maryland + SE DC. There are very few spaces for entrepreneurs in SE DC &amp; Southern Maryland, and even fewer spaces for creative entrepreneurs. </li>
<li>Our space will help cut down the costs of being a creative entrepreneur. Being a creative can be expensive, and our space will help reduce some of those overhead costs by providing access to the necessary equipment/workspaces. </li>
<li>Our space will act as a safe space &amp; community hub for black creative entrepreneurs.</li>
<li>Our space will teach children &amp; young adults the importance of entrepreneurship. Throughout the year we will be holding free after-school &amp; summer classes for local middle schoolers and high schoolers to teach them about the facets of entrepreneurship.

My name is Morgan Davis. I'm a graphic designer, fashion designer, photographer, proud graduate of Howard University, and the founder + CEO of Distinctly Creative. I founded Distinctly Creative in the Winter of 2015 because I wanted to create a safe space + community for black creative entrepreneurs to grow professionally & personally. In addition, I wanted to help further push the narrative that we as black people, black creatives all deserve a seat at the table.
What started as an Instagram page highlighting various black creatives turned into events, the Black Creatives Matter apparel line, the DMV Black Creatives Directory, an online learning platform, and so much more.
Currently, Distinctly Creative is located in a small studio space in Brentwood, MD. This space functions as an event space that's available to rent for a variety of creative events, and a rotating gallery space featuring work by local black creatives. 
In November of this year, Distinctly Creative will be moving to a 3000+ sq ft coworking + maker space in Suitland, MD. This space will allow us to further implement our mission of advocating & supporting for black creatives by opening a space that is catered towards helping creative entrepreneurs succeed. 
 

What's a coworking + makerspace & why? 
A coworking space is a collaborative, shared workspace where entrepreneurs and business professionals are able to work amongst other like-minded individuals. A makerspace is a collaborative workspace that unlike a coworking space provides members access to a variety of maker equipment. 
Coworking + makerspaces are not only a cost-effective option towards having access to professional level tools, but they also help establish a sense of community.
When you give creatives a space to create so many amazing things can happen between networking, economic empowerment, and community building which are things that are so needed, especially in Southern Maryland -- where there are very few spaces that are focused on entrepreneurs in general -- especially black creative entrepreneurs. 
Our new space will be able to provide the tools, resources, education, and community for creative entrepreneurs of a variety of mediums & skill levels -- in an atmosphere that not only promotes creativity + innovation, but does so in a way where it’s also providing a welcoming environment for black creatives & the overall community.
 
What will the space look like + where will it be located? 
Our new coworking + makerspace will be located in Suitland, Maryland next to the Branch Avenue Metro Station. The space is 3,000+ square feet and will include access to the following:

So we are really launching platform, AKA <strong>an “incubator” kitchen </strong>- we handle all regulations, inspections, fees and insurance to maintain a commercial kitchen, which we then rent at an affordable price, so artisans can focus on what matters most to them - their craft. <strong>This will give the local economy a major boost! </strong></p><p>Just as Lulu’s is successfully expanding beyond Sedona out of this space, watch and see what comes of this - all the success of our collaborators. And you get first taste at the Lounge :)</p><p> </p><h2><strong>The Challenges</strong></h2><h3><strong>City Compliance &amp; Funding </strong></h3><p>As we face some real rules &amp; fees with the City of Sedona to do what really want to do (up to 10k sewer fee alone, and brand new, more expensive sign regulations), the biggest challenge we face is not getting enough start-up funding! If our beautiful Sedona community wants to see vital, local businesses succeed in our town, we all need to actively support them. No one wants to see a strip mall in West Sedona. Let’s keep it unique, and support amazing local businesses like Synergy, Chocolatree, Indian Gardens, Creekside, Local Juicery, Interdependence, and all your favorite Local Digs! We need community support right now, especially in the beginning, to create another amazing community space <strong>FOR YOU.</strong></p><h3><strong>Parking</strong></h3><p>Some people have said the parking lot is difficult to get into.

Phase 2 - Optional - THE CONCERT VENUE IF you help this kitchen first succeed, Sedona, both by pledging to this campaign & coming into the lounge, then we build you a real stage intimate concert venue. Costs to be determined, though we already have architect, Dan Surber, & designers with plans in the works. That’s when we really become SYNERGY - food, music, lounge, art, the works - all in one. The ImpactBoosting Local Economy and Beyond Think of all your favorite products that improve your everyday - food, drink, herbals, beauty-care. All your favorite goods come from original creators who put their life’s energy into bringing it to you. SYNERGY is going to bring more of those favorites to you, to Sedona, and beyond. A commercial kitchen is legally required to ship out of state. So we are really launching platform, AKA an “incubator” kitchen - we handle all regulations, inspections, fees and insurance to maintain a commercial kitchen, which we then rent at an affordable price, so artisans can focus on what matters most to them - their craft. This will give the local economy a major boost! Just as Lulu’s is successfully expanding beyond Sedona out of this space, watch and see what comes of this - all the success of our collaborators. And you get first taste at the Lounge :) The ChallengesCity Compliance & Funding As we face some real rules & fees with the City of Sedona to do what really want to do (up to 10k sewer fee alone, and brand new, more expensive sign regulations), the biggest challenge we face is not getting enough start-up funding! If our beautiful Sedona community wants to see vital, local businesses succeed in our town, we all need to actively support them. No one wants to see a strip mall in West Sedona. Let’s keep it unique, and support amazing local businesses like Synergy, Chocolatree, Indian Gardens, Creekside, Local Juicery, Interdependence, and all your favorite Local Digs! We need community support right now, especially in the beginning, to create another amazing community space FOR YOU.ParkingSome people have said the parking lot is difficult to get into. Well we have a solution for that - sedonatakeout.com will bring the goods, drinks, Lulu’s Bliss Shakes and all our offerings right to you. front of building view at the current ""Lulu's Chocolate Lounge""We have a lot to build on, and we start where we are and grow from here - just like Lulu's started out selling chocolate with an umbrellad push cart at California festivals, now look. Just like all your fav foods started in someone's home kitchen.With the support of those who enjoy it, we get there.Please pledge NOW - this is ONLY a 30 day campaign! Delaying means you might forget, so THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR TAKING ACTION NOW! The more you give, the more we can give you to love! This is How We Do ItOur Crew Julie Ayla Earthwalker - Kitchen Manager.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hello! I am Cristina Drumm, the founder of <i>Hygge</i> in Savannah, Georgia. I moved to Savannah in 2013 to study at the Savannah College of Art &amp; Design and fell in love with the city. Owning a brick and mortar shop has been a dream of mine since I was young. This year, I finally took the plunge and poured all of my love, time and savings into making it happen in the city I now call my home. </p>
<p>The name <i>Hygge</i>, pronounced <i>‘hue-guh</i>,’ is a Norweigan and Danish word for a feeling of coziness. The shop is a thoughtful curation of ethical and sustainable goods for the home, body and mind. I am often asked how the concept came together and the answer is simple; it was born out of a love for the things that bring us happiness and offer a sense of wellbeing. </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The money raised will be used for a shop sign, retail displays, shipping fees, and legal startup fees. The sweet perks are my way of saying thank you for your thoughtful contribution to reach my goal. The timing is such that you can even use your gift card redemptions on some holiday shopping!</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>I believe that every piece we bring into our homes should have a purpose and should last a lifetime. I am committed to offering products that are friendly to our environment, ethically produced, one of a kind, and made by individuals who truly believe in their creations. Together, I believe we can create a more mindful approach to buying. </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The inventory costs for the type of goods Hygge carries are high given the nature of production. The majority of the products have been purchased at more than the typical fifty percent (or more) discount offered at wholesale. Having a lower markup does not result in excessive profit when considering the expenses of rent, insurance, supplies, labor and taxes. While risky, I have poured all of my savings as well as taken out a loan because I truly believe in the makers, their wonderful products and the difference they are making in the industry.</p>

<h3>OUR STORY</h3>
<p>Hi, my name is Aidan Miller, and I am the founder of Kwizera Coffee! Growing up in East Africa I witnessed the effects of poverty and unemployment in communities across Rwanda. Our team at Kwizera has a heart for marginalized people and a passion for coffee. Kwizera coffee exists to leverage the specialty coffee industry to provide for hope creation programs that fight sex trafficking and provide economic opportunity to vulnerable women and youth in Rwanda, East Africa! </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1612380682/bm1aixhtgm0vofy0tzmk.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Kwizera coffee is a brand that is a continuation of our journey of using our passion for coffee to directly impact people’s lives. 'Kwizera' in Kinyarwanda (the language of Rwanda) means “hope” or “belief,” and above all we believe that we can use coffee as a means of hope creation and that coffee can be used to bring about greater change in this world. </p>
<p>Kwizera initially started out of the dorm room that I shared with my friend Elijah Reeves. Together we sold coffee to our fellow residents and students on campus. With the help of the College of Business at Lipscomb University we started to develop the company and book ourselves for different events and corporate venues.  </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1612380042/scsxdhrhfedehy5uleug.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>As our bookings increased the future for our company seemed bright! When COVID - 19 hit we had a majority of our contracts canceled. Through the following months we iterated our model to selling coffee online to support food relief packages for people in Rwanda. Praying for an opportunity I was approached by my friend William Robertson  (Seen in the Video above^) and he  connected me to Rocketown. Our missions aligned so perfectly and we had the opportunity to build out a space in their building. </p>
<p>We had a soft launch in October of 2020 but we still have a lot to do to create the space and impact that we have envisioned. I hope you can join our campaign and help us in supporting this vision! </p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>What does ""Hope Creation"" Mean? </strong></h3>
<p> </p>
<p>When we talk about ""Hope Creation"" we are referencing how our company helps to generate hope in peoples' lives through our partnerships and how we operate our supply chain.  Ten percent of all of our profits will be dedicated to supporting our partner organizations that fight sex trafficking and provide economic opportunity to vulnerable communities in Rwanda and throughout East Africa!</p>
<p>This funding will also allow us to achieve our goal of vertical integration with our coffee supply chain by the end of the year and begin to heavily invest with our nonprofit partners. We believe in 100% Transparency. We want you to know exactly who grew your coffee, who picked your coffee, what farm it came from, that they received above fair wages, and how Kwizera's involvement is changing peoples lives for the growth of God's Kingdom!</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Earth + Ether is an educational and retail project birthed by Lindsey Granger on October 1st, 2019. With 6 years of Zero Waste research, 4 years of experience running a Bodywork private practice, and a hunger to hold space for her community, Lindsey trusted her instincts and signed a lease on a retail space in Amesbury, MA. <br/><br/>The retail store stocks a wide variety of Zero Waste Consumables including; Butters, Carrier Oils, Clays, Essential Oils, Herbs, Salts, Seeds, Spices, Waxes and Zero Waste Reusables in 4 categories; Personal Care, Cleaning, Food prep &amp; Storage, School &amp; Office Supplies</p>
<p>The Healing Arts Co-op features 3 Session Spaces available for rent on an as needed basis for 1-1 practitioners in a variety of industries which creates a coworking space for practitioners interested in practicing outside of their homes, but not quite in their very own rented office.  </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need capital to:</p>
<ul>

<h3>Dashi Needs Your Help!</h3>
<p>We've been in business 5 years now, and this has been the toughest period we've ever faced.  Coming out of winter we felt as if we'd hit our stride in the restaurant, the food truck was going out again, we'd expanded our base of loyal customers and we were growing.  Spring was looking good!   Then it all came to a screeching halt as part of the COVID-19 crisis.  </p>
<p>Although we remain open, we have cut back to a skeleton crew.  We are offering only takeout and delivery via the restaurant and most of our food truck services have cancelled.  This leaves enough to keep our heads above water (for now) and we are scrambling to continue going for as long as we can, but we are all facing a crisis of unknown duration and magnitude.</p>
<p>Accordingly, we need your help!  We are committed to keeping our core staff intact for as long as we can so that we can resume normal operations quickly once we get through this crisis.  In order to do so, we are asking you to pre-purchase activities and events (called perks) with Dashi (at a discount!).  Doing so will provide us with much needed additional cashflow during this time, and will enable you to lock in an experience with us once we put all of this behind us and are ready to celebrate!</p>
<p>So, please browse the perks available and make plans to enjoy happier times with us.  Your support means the world to us!  </p>
<p>And, even if you decide you can't spend now on one of these experiences (this is tough on all of us), please spread the word, share this campaign, stop by the restaurant and food truck, and support other local restaurants, breweries, farmers and other small businesses!</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>In September 2018 we were able to secure and open our first restaurant ""Casa Indigo"" in the Pilsen neighborhood in Chicago.  Casa Indigo is a affordable all day type cafe with great coffee, lunch and dinner.  Our menu's soul comes from Mexico City, where our mother Suzanna is from and has taught us her families recipes.  We try and serve unique dishes only found at our restaurant.  Our tortillas are hand made everyday by our Mother from organic Oaxacan heirloom corn that we purchase from a local tortilla maker El Popo.  Our menu is focused on buying local, wild, and sustainable goods.  Our chicken comes from 3 local farms, our beef comes from Slagel Family Farm, all our seafood is wild and or sustainable, and almost everything else in the menu is local or organic when possible.  We serve high quality ingredients with affordable prices so everyone in our neighborhood can enjoy.  With our quality and affordability at the top of our business plan, we hope it allows for all people in our diverse neighborhood to come and try new food, meet new people, start new conversations, and etc.  We offer all our employees liveable wages, health insurance, and daily tips passed out to all employees. </p>
<p>Rebel Owl company was created in the Pilsen neighborhood in Chicago. We use many local business' everyday that make a direct social and economic impact in our community. We've established direct relationships with many local farmers which allows them to keep more revenue while allowing us to offer high quality unique menu in our neighborhood at a reasonable price. This project was founded by lifelong Pilsen residents Mer Mansuria and Carolina Landeros-Mansuria.  Here are some articles and reviews from the Chicago Tribune, and Eater Chicago:</p>

</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Our dream was to open a restaurant in our own neighborhood with food that is not served by any other restaurant in the area. We secured a location and a small investment from family and friends.  Once we started building our restaurant, we had a lot of unexpected expenses and expensive demands from the city of Chicago and health department.  Shortly after opening while preparing for a large catering order, our car was stolen from in front of the restaurant.  We had over $3000 of all our Japanese knives, supplies, equipment, and food stolen(car was found slightly damaged 2 months later).  With some unexpected costs and we had gone a lot deeper into our life savings to keep the restaurant running.  All our employees are from the neighborhood, and our focus is to make our neighborhood thrive through meeting places and great food. We want to increase our hours, increase our menu, add more employees, and be able to provide livable wages and health insurance for the entire staff.</p>
<p>We were hoping to secure a grant from FedEx of up to $50,000 but we did not place in the top 10. However, our business at Casa Indigo is on the rise, and we have gotten great reviews on all our media outlets.  We are now preparing for a busy Summer patio season as well as street festivals for which we will have to purchase equipment and a license.  Busy Patio and street festival season will greatly increase our sales.</p>
<p>We are very close to achieving our goals but but we need your help to raise the money to cover the gap in funding. In return we will offer an array of perks including a large bottle of our habanero hot sauce and our exclusive Indigo Pilsen T-shirt created by Definitive Selection only for us.  Here is what your donations will allow us to complete:</p>
<p><u><strong>$10,000</strong></u></p>
<p>By helping us raise $10,000 you will help us purchase equipment or invest in more retail space that was removed from the budget due to not receiving the FedEx grant.</p>
<p>Increase hours, add more employees, add to menu</p>
<p>Wood-fired Grill</p>
<p>Equipment for All Street festivals</p>
<p>License completion for street festivals and outdoor space.</p>
<p>Apply for the permit for the adjacent land next to our restaurant and reserve it for gardening and al fresco dining</p>
<p>Commissary and Test Kitchen for our growing catering operations and other concepts, space close to our restaurant on 18th St.</p>
<p>Outdoor Patio build-out</p>
<p>Japanese Knives that were stolen when our catering car got stolen</p>
<p><u><strong>$15,000</strong></u></p>
<p>With $15,000, we will be able to cover our cash requirements for working capital until we hit our break-even point and allow us to fund the following:</p>
<p>Living wage salaries/health insurance for owners Chef Mer and the entire kitchen staff</p>
<p>Apply for liquor license, cannabis license research, and outdoor spaces in the city.</p>
<p>Gardening and Green space investment around neighborhood with fresh vegetables and herbs</p>
<p>Marketing</p>
<p>Rainy day fund</p>
<p><u><strong>$20,000</strong></u></p>
<p>Anything raised above $20,000 will go towards building, researching, and acquire more property or retail space, learning how to get into the legal cannabis business to create more local jobs, invest into rent control and affordable housing initiatives, 50-seat outdoor garden space free to the public and for rent, and build out our research and catering kitchen.   Currently, the neighborhood lacks these places where people can gather for events, culture, music, and the arts for free. We hope to provide the space where people could create, discuss ideas and share their talents with the community. We want to inspire that anything is possible.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The Rebel Owl company and Casa Indigo restaurant mission is to have a direct social and economic impact in our Pilsen neighborhood.  The Rebel Owl company will create better paying culinary or hospitality jobs, increase business to business sales within our communities, help bridge the gap between entrepreneurship opportunities and the local residents.</p>
<p>Both Mer and Carolina are natives of the Pilsen neighborhood and we have a long track record of service in the community. Carolina helped create and run ""we are hip hop"" a program which is still running to this day.  Casa Indigo has donated food to numerous local non profit organizations, and food for the homeless in our neighborhood.  During the Polar Vortex of 2019, Casa Indigo donated 200 servings of hot oatmeal to the less fortunate.  </p>
<p>That is why we understand the importance of doing this as a community. With your help, Rebel Owl company and Casa Indigo can:</p>
<p>Provide new taxable revenue into the local economy</p>
<p>Purchase from local urban farms and small businesses</p>

<p>Offer entrepreneurship training and support and work together to learn about the Cannabis industry</p>
<p>Help fund current initiatives that are working to yield high social and economic returns</p>
<p>Additionally, we hope to create a large yearly music festival on 18th St. and use that platform to help fund local initiatives and community interest.</p>

<h3>But first, why?</h3>
<p>Paddle Park was born on a beautiful summer day kayaking on the shores of Lake Erie with my son.  We asked the question, ""Why don't we do this more often?"" That continued with ""What if we could kayak indoors when the weather outside sucks?""</p>
<p>Over the ensuing time that we took to develop the concept of creating a first-of-its-kind indoor paddle sport facility, we learned from paddlers both novice and experienced, as well as those without any paddling experience. The resounding feedback was positive and accepting of creating a facility that allows for educational, therapeutic, physical fitness and entertainment elements suitable for a wide audience of users.</p>
<p>In creating Paddle Park, we want it to be all of these things and a bit more. Providing educational access to disadvantaged kids as well as therapeutic access for those with special needs, we decided to make Paddle Park a social enterprise to meet the needs of these communities. We hope you'll support our mission!</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>To create our first pilot facility, which we are targeting at about a 10,000 square foot size with two pool, locker rooms and a small event space, we seek to raise $100,000. This will cover the cost to rent a warehouse/industrial type space and retrofit it with the necessary equipment we need to get going.</p>
<p><i>Here's the quick breakdown:</i></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Pools and plumbing: $25,000</i></li>
<li><i>Projectors, screens and computers: $20,000</i></li>
<li><i>Watercraft: $10,000</i></li>
<li><i>General buildout including decking, racks, event space, lockers: $20,000</i></li>
<li><i>Facility Lease downpayment: $10,000</i></li>
<li><i>Signage, licenses, insurance: $5,000</i></li>
<li><i>Indiegogo fees and perk fulfillment: $10,000</i></li>
</ul>
<p>We've created some pretty awesome perks where you can get some cool Paddle Park swag, pre-order park time and unlimited use memberships, sponsor educational access for our Kayak Kids program, attend our preview night party, or autograph a permanent art installation at the park. The support/perk levels were carefully crafted to provide you with a great value while allowing us to raise the funds needed to be able to fulfill our promise.</p>
<p>Our stretch goals will allow us to do a little bit more at our first facility. If we raise $150,000 we will be able to add in a retail shop along with a food and beverage center. With $175,000 we'll add in a Pooch Paddle area where you can bring your four-legged friends to swim. And if we make it all the way to $250,000 we will lease a bigger space and add in a fourth pool with pumps powerful enough to recreate some whitewater experiences.</p>
<p>If, by chance, we don't meet our campaign goal here, we will fundraise privately to make up the difference and get Paddle Park built.  Trust us, we want this to come to fruition as much as our followers and supporters do!</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Paddle Park has been carefully structured and designed to be an all-inclusive and highly unique destination that also does good for its community and will serve to enhance Columbus' image and reputation for being a sports/athletic and entertainment destination.</p>
<p>We aim to fill the void of indoor sports and activities by building the first immersive paddle sport facility, that recreates water current and entertaining visuals of the outdoors, all within a climate controlled and secure environment.  The educational opportunities, along with the fitness and entertainment ones are boundless as we have discovered in researching this concept, but we need the financial backing of the paddle sport community to make Paddle Park a reality in order to meet these opportunities.</p>
<p>This project was not sketched out on a napkin last month. In fact, it has taken several years of planned development to get to this point, including market and consumer research, legal navigation, and the building of partnerships with stakeholders in the community. These partnerships include the American Kayaking Association, Adaptive Sports Connection, LifeSports OSU, A Kid Again, Hero USA, Special Olympics and more.</p>
<p>Our ultimate goal is to provide educational, therapeutic, fitness and entertainment access to people of all ages, skills and abilities. For the first-time paddler too fearful of going out on an open body of water, Paddle Park will provide that safe learning environment to get comfortable with a watercraft. For the novice that enjoys the challenge of SUP yoga but is limited to fair weather conditions, Paddle Park will serve that need no matter the weather outdoors.  And for the pro paddler who just wants to sneak in a lunch-break fitness session to stay in top form, Paddle Park will do just that for them.</p>
<p>Beyond that, Paddle Park will allow for fun teambuilding and group outings, party rentals, date  night fun, and probably some things we haven't even thought of yet.  This is a groundbreaking project that, given the chance, can be a transformative experience for many.</p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Resiliency is the hallmark of an entrepreneur, as is remaining adaptable to circumstances beyond ones control.  These are the things I've learned the most having been a small business owner for the past 18 years.  I've also learned that I don't know what I don't know.  In creating Paddle Park I asked many questions of many people and have learned a lot about the paddle sport community. It is our pledge to all of our supporters that Paddle Park will provide a space for ALL people to enjoy paddle sports in a safe and secure environment.</p>
<p>The biggest challenges we foresee is the actual process of securing a facility and building it out.  But with a solid professional contact list and the partnerships we have already developed here in Central Ohio, we'll rally the community to get it done on time and on budget.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Whatever you can do to help us here is wonderful and so truly appreciated. Whether you grab a few perks or not, we ask for you to help us spread the word about our fundraising campaign and how making Paddle Park a reality will benefit our community.</p>

<p>""I support Paddle Park and their mission to create the first indoor paddle sport facility that creates an immersive paddling environment. Check out their campaign on Indiegogo.""</p>
<p> </p>
<p>""Paddle sports should be experienced by people of all ages, skills and abilities, and that's just the mission that Paddle Park is setting out to meet in central Ohio. They're raising funds on Indiegogo and I encourage you to support them (as I do).""</p>
<p> </p>
<p>""Hey fellow paddlers, check out Paddle Park on Indiegogo. They're a new social enterprise raising funds to build a paddle sport facility that will allow for fitness, education and entertainment.""</p>
</div></div>","But first, why?
Paddle Park was born on a beautiful summer day kayaking on the shores of Lake Erie with my son.  We asked the question, ""Why don't we do this more often?"" That continued with ""What if we could kayak indoors when the weather outside sucks?""
Over the ensuing time that we took to develop the concept of creating a first-of-its-kind indoor paddle sport facility, we learned from paddlers both novice and experienced, as well as those without any paddling experience. The resounding feedback was positive and accepting of creating a facility that allows for educational, therapeutic, physical fitness and entertainment elements suitable for a wide audience of users.
In creating Paddle Park, we want it to be all of these things and a bit more. Providing educational access to disadvantaged kids as well as therapeutic access for those with special needs, we decided to make Paddle Park a social enterprise to meet the needs of these communities. We hope you'll support our mission!
 

What We Need & What You Get
To create our first pilot facility, which we are targeting at about a 10,000 square foot size with two pool, locker rooms and a small event space, we seek to raise $100,000. This will cover the cost to rent a warehouse/industrial type space and retrofit it with the necessary equipment we need to get going.
Here's the quick breakdown:

Pools and plumbing: $25,000
Projectors, screens and computers: $20,000
Watercraft: $10,000
General buildout including decking, racks, event space, lockers: $20,000
Facility Lease downpayment: $10,000
Signage, licenses, insurance: $5,000
Indiegogo fees and perk fulfillment: $10,000

We've created some pretty awesome perks where you can get some cool Paddle Park swag, pre-order park time and unlimited use memberships, sponsor educational access for our Kayak Kids program, attend our preview night party, or autograph a permanent art installation at the park. The support/perk levels were carefully crafted to provide you with a great value while allowing us to raise the funds needed to be able to fulfill our promise.
Our stretch goals will allow us to do a little bit more at our first facility. If we raise $150,000 we will be able to add in a retail shop along with a food and beverage center. With $175,000 we'll add in a Pooch Paddle area where you can bring your four-legged friends to swim. And if we make it all the way to $250,000 we will lease a bigger space and add in a fourth pool with pumps powerful enough to recreate some whitewater experiences.
If, by chance, we don't meet our campaign goal here, we will fundraise privately to make up the difference and get Paddle Park built.  Trust us, we want this to come to fruition as much as our followers and supporters do!

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Wandering Deli- Dairy Free is a unique vegan cheese company in Toronto, ON, helmed by Kira Lancaster. We specialize in nut cheeses that embrace the idea that if you wander from dairy, there is a path of truly rewarding delights awaiting you. After years of vegan cheese experimenting, and working in Toronto restaurants, Kira was being asked to make delicious nut cheeses for every occasion by friends and family, and as word spread she extended her cheese endeavours to a 'secret' vegan cheese club that was quickly featured in The Toronto Star, The Globe and Mail, Toronto Life, and various blogs! Needless to say, the secret was out, and she started renting kitchen space generously offered by Easy Restaurant in Parkdale. Running a special order vegan cheese company allowed for vegan cheese creativity to flourish, and we have offered over 40 different vegan cheeses, including the favourites that Wandering Deli offers at farmers markets today. </p>
<p>This year, 2019, Wandering Deli has transitioned it's reach to farmers markets and the response has been overwhelmingly positive! Kira's husband, Cailean Lewis, has joined the company full time and we are overjoyed to be meeting new folks who love what we do on a constant basis. Something we are often asked at farmers markets is 'where else can I buy this? do you have a storefront?""  and that is where this campaign comes in!</p>
<p>We have been offered the downright incredible opportunity to renovate our current production space at Easy Restaurant into Toronto's <u>first bonafide vegan cheese shop!</u> As a small family company, this is huge! A shop would mean we would be able to continue to offer a wide variety of cheeses that truly 'wanders' from the expectation of what 'cheese' or 'dairy' or even 'vegan food' should be. Most large city's have vegan cheese shops popping up, and it would be a true honour to continue this path in our beloved community.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We are so ready to bring this cheese shop to Toronto! We have the space, the team, the oodles of recipes, the awesome clientele, but we need some renovations and equipment:</p>
<p>Your support will help us:</p>
<p>-put a new entrance door on at Easy, just for us ($3000+)</p>
<p>-buy some new kitchen equipment to scale up ($6000+)</p>
<p>-put in a new sink ($700)</p>
<p>-purchase larger quantities of supplies (variable)</p>
<p>-and generally get our space customer ready ($2500+)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In return for your support, we are offering some no-thing-else quite like it perks, like our cheese itself, of course, as well as unique platters- go special occasion with something for two or get lavish and have us craft a whole table for a party! Take a vegan cheese making class with friends, book a private cheese maker consult for yourself (via skype or in person), check out a zine that will have you well on your way to being a vegan cheese platter afficianado, there's something that suits any vegan cheese lover. We are passionate about what we do, and every chance we have to show our gratitude through food is one we will truly celebrate.</p>
<p>If we don't quite reach our goal, we still intend to undertake this project, it will simply be a little slower. If fully funded, we could potentially open our doors in a matter of months, if not, a little longer as we tackle things piece by piece, or wedge by wedge, if you will.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Funding this project not only blossoms a small family business, it rewards the loving community that has supported us along the way. Kira has been wildly lucky on her wandering path to meet so many people who truly love and support not only vegan cheese, but small local business. She's seen Wandering deli (in all it's forms) grow from a facebook group to a family business. This opportunity comes out of years of hard work, but also years of generous folks believing in us. Toronto is a city where it is becoming increasingly cost-prohibitive for companies like ours to find space to get started, and it cannot be understated that the owner of Easy Restaurant is truly putting his faith in community and small-scale entrepreneurial gumption when he offers us this chance. Supporting our dream sends the message that he is doing a great thing! </p>
<p>It's time for Toronto not only to have an artisan vegan cheese shop, but a small business that truly is something the whole community can celebrate.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>There will certainly be challenges, especially if scaling up quickly takes place, but years of honing recipes and working in the food and hospitality industry have Kira and Cailean honed and familiar with tackling the work of a busy food establishment.</p>

<h3>Welcome to ""La Vie en Rose"" Food Truck Crowd Funding Campaign. </h3>
<h3>Bienvenue à mes amis et membres de famille outre-Atlantique.<br/>
</h3>
<div>Delicious, simple, healthy food. My mom's is an authentic French ""Cordon Bleu"" and as far back as I can remember was cooking amazing dishes for our family and friends. She got em hooked on delicious food. She's the reason I am so passionate about cooking and want to bring the same dishes to our community. <br/><br/>Great food means smiles, laughter and happiness.  Chefs like me do what we do  not only to satisfy your hunger,  but to feed your senses and your soul. It's a lot of love embedded in a bunch of ingredients and cooked together :-) <br/>
</div>
<div>I have been working as a Chef  in different restaurants for a long time now. Today my family and I have the chance to start our own business. We have a gorgeous  remodeled school bus which is now a food truck compliant with the Health Department regulations. Obviously we are working on a (very) tight budget. We are doing a lot of the work ourselves and also with the help of some good friends and family members very enthusiast about this project (Thanks Benoit, Greg, Olivier, Spike, Anthony we love you ;-) )</div>
<div>We are almost ready to hit the road. We want to share those special moments  people love to celebrate with great food, which will be ideally completed by eating an authentic French crêpe just as French people have been doing for centuries.</div>
<div>We have a couple of jobs left to finish before we be part of your lives.<br/>
</div>
<div>If you feel like this project is exciting, fun as we think it is then please contribute any the way you can. Every dollar is highly appreciated and counts a lot.

<div>  </div></div>","Hello,
Welcome to ""La Vie en Rose"" Food Truck Crowd Funding Campaign. 
Bienvenue à mes amis et membres de famille outre-Atlantique.

Delicious, simple, healthy food. My mom's is an authentic French ""Cordon Bleu"" and as far back as I can remember was cooking amazing dishes for our family and friends. She got em hooked on delicious food. She's the reason I am so passionate about cooking and want to bring the same dishes to our community. Great food means smiles, laughter and happiness.  Chefs like me do what we do  not only to satisfy your hunger,  but to feed your senses and your soul. It's a lot of love embedded in a bunch of ingredients and cooked together :-) 

I have been working as a Chef  in different restaurants for a long time now. Today my family and I have the chance to start our own business. We have a gorgeous  remodeled school bus which is now a food truck compliant with the Health Department regulations. Obviously we are working on a (very) tight budget. We are doing a lot of the work ourselves and also with the help of some good friends and family members very enthusiast about this project (Thanks Benoit, Greg, Olivier, Spike, Anthony we love you ;-) )
We are almost ready to hit the road. We want to share those special moments  people love to celebrate with great food, which will be ideally completed by eating an authentic French crêpe just as French people have been doing for centuries.
We have a couple of jobs left to finish before we be part of your lives.

If you feel like this project is exciting, fun as we think it is then please contribute any the way you can. Every dollar is highly appreciated and counts a lot. If you can't, please share this campaign with your friends and relatives any way you can. Thanks for Watching/Contributing/Sharing !

</h2><p>This is a document composed by all the members of this
community, in an effort to share our collective vision for the next year (April
2015-April 2016). We have witnessed, and been humbled by, the dream into which
we see this community giving breath, and we are excited to bring you into what
is rising up from our journey in this space. We would love for you to contribute to our vision in any way you can, even if it's just sharing this page with your friends and family.</p>
<h3>
<b>Vision:</b> </h3><p>We see this center as a catalyst for
cultural renewance, integration of interdependence, and spiritual activism. A
home for spiritual warriors who are dedicated to living out a lifestyle
embodying fieriness, aliveness, and loving kindness. We see this community as a
microcosm of what is possible in the world when people bring the fullness of
their being into community. We see this place as a hub of revitalization and a
launch bay to carry people closer to what it means to serve Life. </p>
<p>Our passion is
re-kindling the inner flame: That people can show up with their full sense of
power in the world, and actualize their gifts to wholly project themselves into
a living process of global transformation. We are actively co-creating a
culture that amplifies the essential Self of each community member, so we are
deeply conscious participants in the living process of a world recreated.

     spaces. This community would sustain the Meta-Response Force as a
     continuous practice. </li>

</div><br/></div>","Short Summary Hello from 3 women passionate about coffee and doing business in a conscious way.  We are so excited about providing high quality organic coffee beans sourced with social responsibility as our priority, as well as supporting earth~friendly farming practices. Fair Trade coffee empowers farmers  to lift themselves out of poverty by investing in their farms and communities, protecting the environment, and developing the business skills necessary to compete in the global marketplace. Maine Morning Micro Roasters is committed to serving the greater good and providing fresh, top notch, small batch coffee roasted with love sourced from family farms where people are being supported for their hard work.   What We Need & What You Get Help us get a leg up!  We need $6000 to purchase a micro coffee roaster, associated equipment and complete minor electrical and carpentry work to relocate operations in Nancy's home. We need $500 for commercial insurance so we can sell coffee at our Farmers Markets. We need $1000 for website and logo design and to print marketing materials.    The Impact  We want to make a socially and environmentally responsible statement by proving that we can provide amazing coffee in an affordable way that supports the greater good. 

Our importer buys our Central American and African coffees directly from the farmer eliminating a middleman, thus making sure the growers are the ones that receive a fair benefit of their labor. Our Bolivian and Costa Rican coffee farmers are paid above market prices for quality coffee beans (usually above Fair Trade guidelines).  The farmer that toiled cultivating our coffee beans was treated with the respect he/she deserves and also received fair compensation for his/her added efforts.
 Each of us are successful small business owners and find this new path an intelligent and sweet way to combine forces, passions, and to work smart, sharing something we love in a conscious way. 
We have had extremely positive responses from our friends, family and community when we told them about this business opportunity that came to us. The previous owners of this small coffee roasting company were already touching many and we got handed an opportunity to bring it to the next level for a reasonable investment.    Risks & Challenges We are learning the art and science of  care~fully selecting and roasting coffee beans, while maintaining our other businesses and busy lives. In this interim period we are doing all we can to remain balanced and minimize additional commitments while we follow what really excites us, transitioning into ownership of  Maine Morning Micro Roasters.  We have been self~employed for a combine total of 32 years! That is a lot of experience in being creative and resourceful to generate a living. We are a team each bringing unique skills to the table that compliment each other very well. From customer service, to attention to detail, to bookkeeping, marketing and having a student's mind, we have all it takes for great success!

Please see Perks for details.What is a SuperCyberCenter® Network?The SuperCyberCenter Network is comprised of local online malls featuring physical stores in local neighborhoods - usually 5 to 7 zip codes per Area.  This enables 30-45 minute shopping and delivery to your home and office.Major retailers are the Anchor tenants in the SuperCyberCenter Network similar to physical malls. Anchor retailers help attract customers and benefit from joint marketing programs with other smaller retailer and business tenants. This increases local shopping and employment. Communities remain vibrant.Our role is the Network Coordinator. Our extensive field trials generated millions of orders for customers who became fervent fans of 30-45 minute shopping and delivery from all local SuperCyberCenter Network stores. We also learned we needed to enlist the major retailers both as Anchor tenants and as our Major Marketing Partners by offering them the necessary incentives common in every major Bricks and Mortar Regional mall.
 Your donation will be applied in these important areas:
Launch the SuperCyberCenter Network in your city as Priority #1
Travel to major retailers to enlist them as our Marketing Partners
Update our R&D beta website www.TheNowMall.com (use zip 33180 to test)
Fund our Team's attendance and exhibition in industry tradeshows

The growth of Amazon is sucking the lifeblood from local
stores – and the speed of this is accelerating fast.  Soon shopping malls will be shadows of their
former selves and communities will have greater unemployment. Over 4.3 million Americans work in retail
stores. These jobs will disappear unless we help local stores offer FREE Delivery of Everything in 30 to 45 Minutes, 24/7/365 = The Ultimate Shopping Convenience®

We provide Rapid Online Order Fulfillment (ROOF) that enables customers to order online or by phone from one or more stores and have their products delivered
FREE within 30 to 45 minutes by our team of professional CyberValet Shoppers
who go to the stores, buy the products and bring them to the customer
immediately (not in arbitrary ""windows"").
You can order anything that local stores have on their
shelves: groceries, fast food, clothing, electronics, hardware, office
supplies, toys, etc. with FREE Delivery to your home and office.
Imagine what you need and want NOW !!  
Local stores join the SuperCyberCenter Network and advertise
to their customers in their stores and online to let them know they now have a way to get
immediate FREE delivery instead of using Amazon.  This keeps the store owner in business with added incremental higher-profit sales, the staff employed and customers VERY happy!
Perks:  When you register online with your local SuperCyberCenter Mall, you can choose to be a regular member or an Advantage Member. Just think of your lifestyle improvement with your Advantage Membership service in the SuperCyberCenter Network from these magnificent major retailers and all the other local stores that will come along with them in your local area.  (Amazon charges $99 yearly for Prime Membership and you still don't get 30-45 minute service, let alone FREE delivery that fast - and you're limited to what is in their warehouse.)Your Advantage Membership includes 5% product discount and ability to place phone orders. Your Advantage Membership confirmation will be sent within 45 days of your donation. The valid time period will begin when these retailers open their part of the service in your zip code.  See Perks for details
Here's our deal:

$10 Donation = Autographed copy of Book sent to Top Retailers 
$25 Donation = 1 year Advantage membership in TheNowMall 
$50 Donation = 2 years Advantage membership in TheNowMall
$75 Donation = 3 years Advantage membership in TheNowMall
$100 Donation = 5 years Advantage membership in TheNowMall

We field tested our proprietary technology and
marketing programs in many cities with excellent results.   We bootstrapped our
R&D and now your donations are needed to help us launch the SuperCyberCenter Network nationwide - starting with the Areas where our donors live, update our beta R&D website, attend and
exhibit in industry tradeshows and meet with major retailers to get them to
join us as marketing partners to roll out nationwide. We met with senior executives of several major retailers and shopping malls who call our program The Holy Grail Of Retail. Your donation will enable us to continue our conversation and enlist their participation. 
These major retailers (e.g. Best Buy, Target, Publix and
Walgreens) and shopping malls also have experienced flat or declining sales for years due to
Amazon’s growth and all their omnichannel efforts have failed to put them back
on track.  Get our book ""INSTANT GRATIFICATION: The Trillion Dollar Retail Market Revealed"" as a perk or order on Amazon.

</h3> <p>If you are a mobile massage therapist, you know very well how difficult it is to go from appointment to appointment carrying all your stuff - massage beds aren't the smallest, or lightest, things to carry around. In and out of the car, up and down stairs, through doorways, setting up. By the time you've done a days work, it's YOU that needs a massage!<br/></p>

When I trained as a massage therapist back in 1998, I experienced the same problems, as did many of my fellow students (we had to bring our own beds to each class). That was when I asked the question ""what if they folded up smaller, to the size of a sports bag?"" And the idea was born. Sixteen  years later ...<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1242916/files/20150223120658-girlwithcouch400x600.jpg?1424722018"" src="""" style=""""/><br/><br/><h3>Introducing ..... microCOUCH<br/>
</h3>microCOUCH looks and functions like any other massage bed when setup and in use, but quite different when it comes to moving it! Instead of folding in half like other beds, microCOUCH is made up of six sections and folds in on itself down to the size of a small suitcase. This makes transporting it from place to place easy. <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1249315/files/20150225145011-indie_microCOUCH_folded.jpg?1424904611"" src="""" style=""""/>
It also has a unique leg arrangement. There are no leg support braces and no cables! Each leg has it's own locking catch. Simply pull back the spring loaded catch, swing the leg down and let it 'click' into place. So less setting up time.<br/>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1249384/files/20150225151909-indie_microCOUCH_details.jpg?1424906349"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h3>
</h3>
<h3></h3>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Traditional massage tables are typically constructed from wood, with either wooden or aluminium legs. microCOUCH will be made from High Density Polyethylene (HDPE), which is not only very strong, but also lightweight.<br/></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1265382/files/20150303113113-indie_montage.jpg?1425411073"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
We hope that microCOUCH will transform the way in which mobile therapists do their business. No more sore backs.<br/><br/>microCOUCH. Smaller. Lighter. Easier.<br/><br/><h3>
<br/>Status of the project &amp; next steps</h3>
<p>We've spent the last twelve months designing the product and testing 
the prototypes, and now we are finally ready to start the production,

<li>Order the moulds for plastic injection</li>
<li>Order materials</li>

</div></div>","My back hurts!
 If you are a mobile massage therapist, you know very well how difficult it is to go from appointment to appointment carrying all your stuff - massage beds aren't the smallest, or lightest, things to carry around. In and out of the car, up and down stairs, through doorways, setting up. By the time you've done a days work, it's YOU that needs a massage!
Sound familiar? When I trained as a massage therapist back in 1998, I experienced the same problems, as did many of my fellow students (we had to bring our own beds to each class). That was when I asked the question ""what if they folded up smaller, to the size of a sports bag?"" And the idea was born. Sixteen  years later ...Introducing ..... microCOUCH
microCOUCH looks and functions like any other massage bed when setup and in use, but quite different when it comes to moving it! Instead of folding in half like other beds, microCOUCH is made up of six sections and folds in on itself down to the size of a small suitcase. This makes transporting it from place to place easy. 
It also has a unique leg arrangement. There are no leg support braces and no cables! Each leg has it's own locking catch. Simply pull back the spring loaded catch, swing the leg down and let it 'click' into place. So less setting up time.





Traditional massage tables are typically constructed from wood, with either wooden or aluminium legs. microCOUCH will be made from High Density Polyethylene (HDPE), which is not only very strong, but also lightweight.

We hope that microCOUCH will transform the way in which mobile therapists do their business. No more sore backs.microCOUCH. Smaller. Lighter. Easier.
Status of the project & next steps
We've spent the last twelve months designing the product and testing 
the prototypes, and now we are finally ready to start the production, 
but we need your help.
As of today, all the manufacturers are ready to begin production and your support on our campaign will help us to:

Order the moulds for plastic injection
Order materials
Assemble the product
Quality test and inspection
Design, produce and manufacture the packaging
Shipping to our warehouse
International shipping to your home.


We are optimistic about shipping out microCOUCH in the first weeks of September.

<div>has been rough.  This year? Okay. The past 27 years have been rough. This year in particular I was diagnosed with Fibromyalgia, a chronic pain disorder that people with depression have a predisposition to. It also can be brought on by a trigger such as PTSD (my diagnose from shortly after my dad passing).</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>The tricky thing about Fibro is there isn't much information out there about it yet. And medicating the disease is pretty much a crapshoot. The first medication they put me on spiked my depression and landed me in the hospital. I have talked for years and years about how bad my depression and anxiety have been. In the two weeks that they had me on, let's call it ""ZimBalta"", I was questioning my desire to live and fighting every muscle and bone in my body that were ready to give up.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>After a week in the hospital and $50,000 later they weened me off ""ZimBalta"" and tried me on ""Myrica"". ""Myrica"" was actually helping until the auditory and visual hallucinations started. Nothing scarier than being a single, alone, 27 year old girl who keeps slipping out of reality. I got to the point where I removed the dials from my stove and tried my hardest to keep myself safe which was feeling more and more out of my control as the medication kicked in.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>After an MRI and some testing, it was determined that ""Myrica"" was causing the hallucinations and hopefully in weening me off of them I would start to get better mentally, but there were still no answers on how to treat my condition physically. </div> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>I am tired of being sick and tired. I am tired of being behind with every bill as this year has left me unable to work for large periods of time. I am ready to be well and I am ready to do good. In raising money I promise to take everything passed on to me and pay it forward with my time, experience, words, and love. </p>
<p>I am currently in need of a piece of shit car, a functioning computer, and just enough to get caught up financially and pay my medical insurance. </p>
<p>With your help, I promise to spend my time becoming a volunteer and friend to many in need who have been through the same struggles I have. I will be volunteering with a suicide hotline, a sexual abuse hotline/support group, a fibromyalgia support group, and a loss and grief support group.  Every penny raised will just increase my ability to do what I believe I was put on this earth to do, and that's to be there for others and give back as much to this world as I have taken from it. </p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>I believe everything happens for a reason.  Which is crazy considering my past of abuse, struggle, and loss.  But if what happened to me, and the things I have experienced can help or change one person's life - then surviving this all will mean something.</p>
<p>I just want a chance to show the world how beautiful I see it. </p>
</div><div>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">A share of this page to me is just as valuable as a dollar raised.  I also find great benefit in words of encouragement, shared stories of love and loss, and any assistance finding a cheap car or computer so I can continue to network, meet strangers and make them smile. </span></p>

Nothing scarier than being a single, alone, 27 year old girl who keeps slipping out of reality. I got to the point where I removed the dials from my stove and tried my hardest to keep myself safe which was feeling more and more out of my control as the medication kicked in.

After an MRI and some testing, it was determined that ""Myrica"" was causing the hallucinations and hopefully in weening me off of them I would start to get better mentally, but there were still no answers on how to treat my condition physically.    What We Need & What You Get I am tired of being sick and tired. I am tired of being behind with every bill as this year has left me unable to work for large periods of time. I am ready to be well and I am ready to do good. In raising money I promise to take everything passed on to me and pay it forward with my time, experience, words, and love. 
I am currently in need of a piece of shit car, a functioning computer, and just enough to get caught up financially and pay my medical insurance. 
With your help, I promise to spend my time becoming a volunteer and friend to many in need who have been through the same struggles I have. I will be volunteering with a suicide hotline, a sexual abuse hotline/support group, a fibromyalgia support group, and a loss and grief support group.  Every penny raised will just increase my ability to do what I believe I was put on this earth to do, and that's to be there for others and give back as much to this world as I have taken from it. 
    The Impact I believe everything happens for a reason.  Which is crazy considering my past of abuse, struggle, and loss.  But if what happened to me, and the things I have experienced can help or change one person's life - then surviving this all will mean something.
I just want a chance to show the world how beautiful I see it. 

    Other Ways You Can Help A share of this page to me is just as valuable as a dollar raised.  I also find great benefit in words of encouragement, shared stories of love and loss, and any assistance finding a cheap car or computer so I can continue to network, meet strangers and make them smile.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<div>
<p>We are two friends who like to have fun and always willing to try new experiences. Blob grabbed our attention since the first time we saw it in one of the episodes of Jackass. Since my friend and I both like spending time on the beach, we decided to build the Blob on one of the European beaches in Romania. It was the best decision ever! People fell in love with Blob from the first day it got available to the public. We had 4000 jumps a month. We were happy to bring a new type of entertainment to the Romanian beach and we also enjoyed watching people having fun trying it. </p>
<p>Now it's time to bring it to New York!! There is no better way to have more satisfaction and adrenalin than Blobbing! We are eager to introduce Blob to New York beaches this summer so people can experience a new way of having fun at the shore. </p>

Sometime recently, I managed to live abroad for quiet a long time in Europe, mainly in Poland for about 15 months, which gave me the chance to see different countries and meet lots of free spirits and great people from all around the world. Cheap and low cost budget travel always interested me, I've always done it and helped others as well. I hosted people, Surfed others couches, beds, and floors. I traveled, hitchhiked and took share cars in several countries. As well as it is known worldwide Palestine is one of the most interesting places to visit by so many different people and for so many different reasons with as many different perspectives. Unfortunately due to so many barriers and restrictions, the hosting and couchsurfing idea is not as popular as it should be, you might not know, but occupation makes it really hard for people to trust strangers and international people, although the people here are so very welcoming and hospitable. So here came my idea in order to make the idea of hosting a bit more popular and more accepted.

</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Because locals are changing over time,
local guidebooks and even the internet information soon get obsolete. But nowadays,
people who find great restaurants, encounter eye-opening happenings or
experience something different from usual, they take those pictures or movies
and post those to the social media. So, if we follow the social media, we get
real time information updating with durations. However in the current social
media system, the information usually comes from your following friends. It is
difficult to reach suitable and nearby information you need. Therefore, to
solve the problem, our invented system extracts and analyzes all social media
posts in real time and notify you what is happing or what is interesting in
your area.</p>

Spectee - 
The smart and intelligent social travel guide with
nearby SNS for visitors to Japan 
 
Spectee is a location-based information distribution
platform that curates and analyzes tweets and Instagram posts in real time. The
platform collects every contribution from Twitter and Instagram, posted by
people in your location, and sorts it based on geotags, keywords, our knowledge
database and machine learning, that enables you to find nearby local
information, local cool stuff, nice restaurants and happenings as you move
around.


  Why we develop 



Because locals are changing over time,
local guidebooks and even the internet information soon get obsolete. But nowadays,
people who find great restaurants, encounter eye-opening happenings or
experience something different from usual, they take those pictures or movies
and post those to the social media. So, if we follow the social media, we get
real time information updating with durations. However in the current social
media system, the information usually comes from your following friends. It is
difficult to reach suitable and nearby information you need. Therefore, to
solve the problem, our invented system extracts and analyzes all social media
posts in real time and notify you what is happing or what is interesting in
your area.




   Compatibility with smart wearable devices 
The app is also compatible with smart wearable
devices, watches, glasses, etc.



    Why we need your support and What you get 

The Japanese version has already been
released and promotionally tied up with Sony. And it has been accessing to more
than 7 million users. Now, we are planning to develop an English version that
is specially customized to foreign visitors to Japan. The new English version
will especially focus on collecting the local information that is not listed in
travel guidebooks and connecting and communicating with local people who speak
English.

    Why it is attractive 

Tokyo is going to host the 2020 Olympic
Game. So, now Japan is continuously upgrading to be a foreign visitor friendly
country. Japan is also listed as one of the top tourism countries by many
tourism organizations in the world. Next five years up to 2020, foreign visitors to Japan will be enormously growing.



Visit Japan with Spectee

With the new English version, you can discover
enjoyable things outside your experience while visiting Japan; those cannot be
found in travel guidebooks.


Your support will be much helpful for our

Your contribution will turn a parking space (two spaces actually) into a one-of-a-kind parklet -- a public destination for all ages.   We wanted to go beyond railings and tables, to create a new landmark at the north end of Temescal. The 51st Street Parklet will be located at 510 51st Street in beautiful Oakland, CA and will be a free, public place we can all be proud of. 








This Project Can Only Happen with Your SupportWe have come up with some fun incentives to help make this worth your while. Contribute and be a part of crafting a beautiful, safe and unique space for our community to be enjoyed for years to come.  




  What We Need & What You Get So, we need at least $29,000 (fingers-crossed!) to build this one-of-a-kind parklet:  
The funds will go entirely to the cost of building the parklet.  There are a number of structural pieces including a rigid steel frame, shade overhang, and bike parking.  Your contributions fund the materials and builders needed to produce the parklet. The artistic elements add to the beauty and to costs, but we know together we can do this. 
 
We have some unique perks as thanks for your donations, including: Temescal and 51st Parklet swag, a cooking class with famed Chef Preeti Mistry, some seriously awesome spice blends and a local farm tour with picnic to boot. And for the big spender - we got you! - your ultimate birthday bash at Juhu Beach Club with 40 of your besties! Check out all these perks and more and help us build this thing!





Help Us Spread the Word!
 It's going to take all of us to make this happen. Every dollar counts, and all types of contributions are important. You can help by:  Contributing and getting the word out by using the Indiegogo share tools

Making some noise about our campaign -- we would be reallllly grateful!

</div></div>","A Crowdsourced And Streamlined Vision To Reduce The Footprint And Evolve An Outdated Shipping Industry.






Purpose:One day we'll all look back on ""snail mail"" as a stepping stone to something greater. Much like the beeping of a pager before smart phones redefined the modern world. As a result of the progress in telecommunications and eco-friendly automobiles, we've now reinvented the response time in which consumers can interact with the vast world of e-commerce and only use a fraction of the earth's precious resources along the way!Our Mission: You just purchased an online product. We bring it to your door in 2-12 hours! The arrival time is up to you!As a childhood dream of being an entrepreneur has stirred with years of experience in the shipping industry, we're now honored to present this unrivaled efficiency to the world! We sought crowdfunding as (what we thought to be) the perfect platform to aid in launching something so exciting and personable for every online shopper.As you read and enjoy...keep in mind that, through this campaign, you have an exclusive opportunity to be part of our journey. Should you choose to contribute, it could be your favorite shoe store, fashion line, family owned business, etc., that we choose to deliver for next! 
The sole purpose of your pledge is to launch this brand new venture and support these evolved services! 

(Above) ""Understanding The Law"" podcast host Peter J. Lamont, esq. (a top rated and nationally recognized business and personal law attorney) conveyed the excitement and innovation of 12 Hour Express on April 21st, when we became a sponsor of the show. Thank you Mr. Lamont! We were very happy to be a part of your show! (Check them out at www.utlradio.com)
(Above) After being approved and cited, 12 Hour Express has acquired legal rights to show the logos. Check out the""gallery"" photos for more info.




Operations At A Glance:

With their overhead, they won't stand a chance against us! 
Signing up: All customers will initially create an account with us and be required to have a verified form of payment on file before placing a delivery. With this, we can go to any store for you, make a purchase, then bring it right to you. 



Service Options & Procedures:


1.) #BuyAndZipBy Service


When you get to the shipping part of an online purchase, you'll see the 12 Hour Express option (and price) beside our competitors. [After having a laugh at what the others are charging to make you wait for days] You'll select from a list of 2 hour delivery windows, telling us when you'd like it delivered. You can request delivery as soon as possible or, if you're not at the shipping address yet, you can have it delivered later.



2.) Standard Pickup And Delivery Service 
Let's say you're at work and you need a delivery to be picked up from your mother's house and dropped of to you at your place of work... 
This would start on our app or website by you keying in the pickup and delivery addresses. Once you do that, it'll notify all of our drivers within a 10 mile radius. (at this point, you'll have the option to view each driver's profile. Easily seeing their personal photo, their vehicle photo, service rating, customer reviews, etc.). Shortly thereafter (within seconds), you'll start getting responses from drivers who can fulfill the delivery within the time frame that you require. Based on what you've read, you'll select the driver that best meets your satisfaction. 
(If the driver is picking up an item that needs to be bought, you'll be required to accept our terms of agreement before the order is competed.)
Once the delivery is placed and accepted by a driver, you can contact and track them the while in route, until you've received a delivery confirmation email (showing the picture of the location or the signature of the person it was left with). 






3.) Boomerang Service (send and receive)

The details in this delivery are the same as the standard delivery plus two (very convenient) additions.
1) You have the option to add a 3rd delivery point 
2) You can add special instructions to have done before leaving each one of them.
For example: You have a document that needs to be signed... 
Our driver comes to pick it up, delivers it to the signers location, waits until all documents are signed, then returns back to you once they're filled out. 



Driver Requirements:


Electric, hybrid, or 4 cylinder vehicles only
LiveScan background check
18-Point vehicle inspection
Smart phone with G.P.S.
An up-to-date profile for all customers to see
Only deliver in the area that they live
10 year D.M.V. printout


This is a brand new form of digital logistics for the shipping along with an unrivaled reduction in overhead! Your delivery is always taken care of on the day you want it to be.

Want more examples of our service? Check the ""updates"" for real life scenarios of our service, we like to call 12 Hour ""Expressions""






The Impact:

Our #BuyAndZipBy service gives local businesses a direct and unique connection with their customers. We'll be showing you who we're partnered with on our site so you go directly to their online store.
Furthermore, could you imagine if the vast majority of those 10s (or 100s) of thousands of Fedex and UPS trucks were replaced with an electric, hybrid, or 4 cylinder vehicle?? 
Also, check our ""gallery"" to watch a short documentary on the effects of Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy for P.T.S.D. See what the $1 from every pledge will be going towards!





F.A.Q:

Why haven't they thought of this? Or done this?
While we won't lie and say we're not afraid of this catching on or seeing big courier companies reform, we also know that we have a huge head start (and a unique logistics strategy). These multimillion and billion dollar companies have built an empire on the logistics and tools they're already using. We couldn't imagine what their costs would be to completely re-do their whole operation. 12 Hour Express is starting with technology and expanding upon it.
With so many pieces of mail delivered everyday, how will they all get there on the same day they're shipped?
After working for years in the courier industry, Jonathan's very savvy about how much one driver can handle within certain time frames. The more deliveries = more drivers.  





Thank you so much for taking the time to read this and allowing us to share our vision with you!

<p><b></b></p>
<p>One major obstacle that we may face is having an extremely large demand where we would have too many programs to design and manage for our staff. This would require us to hire more professionals to work on our team and delay the amount of programs we can provide from the start. We are preparing a training program and hiring process for new Dynasty Performance Labs professionals to account for this.</p>
<p>Another major obstacle could be an issue in the programming of our user portal. Should an issue arise that would result in a delay of product availability, we will communicate with you and provide an updated timeline.</p>
<p>We have managed to put together this initial offering of exercise videos and online training tools with minimal resources, however we have a much larger vision in mind.

We have already invested a significant amount of money, but like any small business start-up, we need a little more to fill our store with awesome products


This project will create 5 full time and 3 part-time jobs when we open (and more in the future)    Plus, it will also help the other small businesses who are supplying us with products. That means that Fudge from Uranus isn't just Tasty, It's good for America!


We are trying to create a Historic Route 66 Destination for friends and family to stop and visit and leave with a funny tee-shirt, some tasty fudge and a belly full of laughs.

Frequently Asked Questions


Is this a Joke or is it ""For Real""?It's ""For Real"".  We have a saying here about our fudge ""You buy it the 1st time as a joke, but the 2nd time because it tastes so darned good""  We are creating a real business that will create several new jobs in our area. This Campaign isn't just about the Fudge (even though it is really awesome too)



Is Uranus Missouri really a town?Not yet, but the people involved in the Uranus Missouri project actually have the ability in the future to make it into a legally recognized ""VIllage"". However, over the next several years, the main focus is to build a ""destination"" that brings in visitors and revenue from outside the area, 


What exactly is Uranus Missouri on Historic Route 66 trying to accomplish? Uranus is located in a very unique place. On Historic Route 66, On Interstate-44 (between St. Louis and Springfield, Missouri) and adjacent to a U.S. Military Base, Uranus is positioned to be able to create a one-of-a-kind destination    However, it is sometimes tough being in a community that relies almost entirely on the local Military Base (Fort Leonard Wood) for our revenue stream.     This means that the local area is subject to the whims of the people in Washington D.C. (ie. Congress) and how they decide to spend their budgets.  Because of the downsizing of the Military over the past several years and possibly in the future and of course, nonsense like the government shutdowns and sequesters, we have seen huge swings in the unemployment rates, multiple small business closures, especially the ones that relied almost solely on base traffic and area sales tax revenues in the area drop several % points.   Don't get me wrong, it is wonderful to know that no matter what, we will have the ""nearness"" of the military base to help our business grow and sustain itself, but by creating a destination that appeals to people all over the country (and the world) the folks in Uranus hope to create a more stable business model for the area.

 Can other people put businesses in Uranus?  Yes, and in fact, Uranus is setting up a way for people to raise money through crowdfunding on Indiegogo to Launch their own business in Uranushttp://uranusmissouri.com/startup-uranus/

<p><b>Exponential
Reforestation</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The
     More for Less Paradigm permits exponential reforestation to emerge.  First the farmer experiences a better
     way, next the idea spreads and spreads. 
     Those who might say that one product will not be feasible for so
     many growers and consumers are correct. 
     To solve that we have more than 300 more food source trees from
     which to select.</li>
<li>With
     regards to the beginning, i.e. Moringa oleifera:  When we grow 100,000 Moringa oleifera
     not only does the community of 900 farmers climb out of poverty the
     ecology benefits as if we had planted 2 million to 5 million trees of the
     other more general varieties.  </li>
<li>This
     campaign is the first outreach used to engage our agroforestry
     demonstration farm as the initial step to reforesting the Philippines.</li>
<li>The
     magnitude of what your contribution will help us, all of us, to achieve
     starts with this ongoing sole proprietorship model for replication, it is THE
     BEGINNING TO THE REFORESTATION OF THE PHILIPPINES THROUGH INCREMENTAL
     REPLICATION BY FARMERS AND ENTREPRENEURS WHO UNDERSTAND THAT THEY CAN EARN
     MORE FROM GROWING TREES THAN THEY CAN FROM TRADITIONAL MONOCROP FARMING. </li>
<li>The
     Philippines needs to be reforested, it is basically agricultural, which is
     not alleviating poverty; of the millions of farmers, nearly all are poor. </li>
<li>Growing
     Moringa oleifera at the demo-farm and in the adjacent community will provide
     a model for the other farmers to successfully grow trees that within one
     year provide a substantial increase in their incomes. </li>
<li>The
     leaves of Moringa oleifera trees grown on 300 square meters are
     commercially more productive than growing rice on 15,000 square meters or
     50 times (50x) more profitable. </li>
<li>In
     this example Moringa oleifera is the tree of choice and this plan provides
     the step-by-step process for rapidly winning over the farmer. The plan
     demonstrates how the Philippines can reforest incrementally and rapidly to
     help both the economy and the environment and thirdly, the consumer. The
     demonstration farm is on track to open in July/August of this year. There
     are more than 1,000 similar valleys on Mindoro that can replicate the
     project as a beginning. In concert with the Barangay of Tanyag in January
     2016 we are jointly planting 33,333 Moringa oleifera annually for three
     years on contiguous land provided by 100 farmers. The entire community of
     900 will share in the work and the profits.  The Philippines has over 7,000 islands
     and 42,000 barangays, the task requires exponential thinking and
     approaches but first it must be totally in-house from where it can reach
     outwardly.</li>

licensing and health requirements including the respective labeling and packaging where we
will set our product apart from others by making authorized nutritional and
health benefit claims as we may.</p>
<p>We are on the verge of having a positive
cash flow which will be turned internally to meet our continuing requirements.  This outreach is to raise
us to the next level and permit us to step away from the ordinary and

they could be otherwise.  </p>
<p>We need to deal directly with the
consumer who needs to be our customer and partner.  Our product is a food with tremendous
nutrients so we need government certified/approved testing to enable us to make
such claims on our labeling.  </p>
<p>We need to get away from the present
practice of using a toll company and not being able to list the beneficial
claims of our product that we want our customers to know about.  </p>
<p>Your help by joining our membership will
enable us to complete these requirements in record time so that we can market

recipients also begin reforesting.</p>
<p>We do profit financially and our as the profits
grow the overall project will expand more rapidly from our internal funding. </p>
<p>One reason we selected Moringa oleifera
to be our first product is that the existing worldwide research is extensive

Value</b></p>
<p>Our gift to you as a new member has
special value for you, examine this:</p>
<ul>
<ul>
<li>Value,
      retail:  two orders of 60 capsules
      each, 500mg, per month, one-year is $514.68, your gift for membership.</li>
<li>The
      funds from the membership go to the support, maintenance, care, custody
      and control of one Moringa oleifera tree at the demonstration farm and to
      reforest.  </li>
<li>The
      proceeds from the sale of product produced by that tree far exceed the
      cost of the gift and the size of the gift to you is double your monthly
      requirement.  The value of the
      extra 60 capsules that you do not need is about $16.00 and you will have
      12 of them over the next year valued at 257.34 which allows you to
      sustain your membership indefinitely while personally benefiting from the
      health benefits that we are seeking to be able to claim on our own
      label.  </li>
<li>The
      funds that we receive will first go to qualify Hilltop Moringa oleifera
      leaf powder to make health and/or therapeutic claims on its label.  Beyond that goal the membership
      proceeds will go directly to the direct involvement of the community to
      grow 33,333 new seedlings each year for three years commencing in January
      2016 in partnership with Hilltop Moringa Farms.  </li>
<li>Proceeds
      from those producing trees will be used to enhance the public relations
      of the project to foster broader interest in the neighboring villages and
      others to observe the lessons of the demonstration farm and to create
      replication that leads to reforestation in other villages.  </li>
<li>The
      unwitting benefit is the carbon tradeoff.

</div> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3>
<div>
<p>The characteristics of the Moringa
oleifera tree are such that the 100,000 trees combined over their lifetime will
be able to offset 30,001.7 tons of CO<sub>2</sub>.<a rel=""noopener nofollow""><span><span>[1]</span></span></a>  The uncanny quantity and diverse nature of
the nutrients contained in Moringa oleifera are well documented and when
Hilltop Moringa Farms is able to make these credible claims about its
particular product line we will be able to grow, produce and provide products
exclusively from our own farms.  Our
products will avoid all middlemen.  The cost
of producing the product is absorbed from the membership dues and the excess “profit”
is for reforestation.</p>
<ul>
<li>The
     growing area in Tanyag will be 10 hectares of community land.  Considering that the Moringa oleifera
     produces twenty to fifty times (20x to 50x) more CO<sub>2</sub> extraction from the air than the
     Japanese Cedar and other general vegetation that planting 100,000 Moringa
     oleifera is the equivalent of between two to five million “regular” trees.<a rel=""noopener nofollow""><span><span>[2]</span></span></a>  From the memberships sought in this
     campaign the results should be the equivalent of three million trees per
     village for ten villages or 30,000,000 trees.</li>
<li><span style=""background-color: initial;"">This
     project has everyone’s best interest at heart throughout the world, even
     those who do not believe in climate change mitigation or eating healthy
     food. The benefits from reforestation can only help us all and the
     benefits from making very healthy food available to the rising billion,
     likewise, can only help us all.</span></li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li> The single most significant part of the
     project is replication.  Why?  Social psychology is at play here.  Only the farmers, particularly the poor
     farmers, can successfully reforest deforested lands that lay barren.  Any other way involves either the
     wealthy or the government using traditional methods that are far too
     costly and consistently wrought with failure.</li>
<li><span style=""background-color: initial;"">""I began growing
     Mahogany trees in November 1999 when I first visited the 9,000 hectare,
     remote and mostly barren, island in the Philippines which was inhabited
     with 16,000 people, all subsistence farmers.” Is what Reynolds has told to
     so many, so many times over so many years and is willing to tell it so
     many more times?  He observed the
     lack of soil, fresh water and protection against the wind.  The logistics were a nightmare. He met
     30 local farmers who all belonged to the local forester’s association,
     interesting especially when considering that they had no training
     whatsoever in forestry.  The village
     (barangay) captain, who was his host, had spent three years working in
     Japan as a forester in one of Japan’s foreign assistance programs. When he
     returned to his roots on Ilin Island he planted Mahogany seeds with the
     money that he had earned.  His
     friends, the farmers, joined him and they formed a forestry association
     but they had no resources to buy even seeds.   “We selected 10 of the farmers and
     entered into agreements that our foundation would provide seedlings, which
     they would each plant on their land, maintain them, replace those that
     died and get paid for their labor; the trees however would remain the
     property of the foundation.” Reynolds recalls. </span></li>
<li>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">As
     of this time the program has more than 50,000 mature Mahogany trees all growing

     will be for their grandchildren, they too know and appreciate that the
     sustainable forest benefits Mother Nature. 
     Each farmer took it upon himself to plant seedlings for himself from
     seeds that they scrounged and other farmers outside of the program also
     planted in a similar fashion until the total was close to double.  The nearly 100,000 trees continue to
     grow and so does our trust for one another. </span><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1435627421/lrtegg6whrcqxy3mt1lb.jpg"" src="""" style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""/>

<p>Using Moringa oleifera as
the Tree of Choice</p>
<ul>
<li>What
     it is that we offer for the poor farmer is a significantly higher earnings
     methodology that is regular and sustainable, unlike rice that has a
     150-day cycle before repeating its laborious self, time and time again?  On the low end this plan will increase
     the local farmer’s net income per square meter of P5.4 to P35.2 and
     subsequently to P70 (US $0.12 to $0.80 and subsequently to $1.59), an
     increase of more than 1,200%.  </li>
<li>This
     program varies by using a demonstration approach and changing from timber
     to food production.  The tree of
     choice rapidly provides highly nutritional leaves on a regular basis after
     only about six months.  The result
     is healthy food, cash flow and discretionary money for both the farmer and
     the project.  In time, after the
     basic needs of the farmer are met he will become a student and advocate of
     climate change mitigation.  At that
     point watch the reforestation take off exponentially, but for now let’s
     get him sustainable income from growing trees.  </li>

<p></p>
<p>The
primary risk is in the influence that soothsayers possess.  In particular the ones who say that it is too
good to be true.  </p>
<p>The
significant results from the anticipated growth of the trees is risky to sell
to the traditional farmer unless it is first demonstrated beyond doubt.  </p>
<p>Our
biggest challenge is to complete the demonstration farming cycle and show
through documentation that corresponds directly with the farmer’s hands-on
examination of the trees, their leaves, the harvesting, processing, packaging,
marketing, selling and generating positive cash flow that shows actual income
that exceeds what they are used to receiving from growing rice.  </p>
<p>Everything
is in place to be able to so demonstrate except for our being able to not have
to outsource the packaging and being able to make health claims, however, even
under the current co-packaging arrangement the farmer will still benefit with no
less than ten times (10x) his current net earnings from growing rice.  That is because he is paid for the wet matter
(leaves) as they are harvested from the trees. 
His share from the subsequent processing and sale of the finished
product is extra, an incentive to help see the process through to the
finish.  In order to make it possible for
him to earn the extra we must be able to label the project ourselves, with
claims.</p>
<p>At
the Hilltop Moringa Demonstration farm …..</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>In
short, our greatest risk is in non-believers but our greatest barrier to that
influence is in presenting empirical data along with hands-on examination of
the process, the product and proof of income.

in January 2016 Hilltop Farmers’ Helper Demonstration Farm in partnership with
Barangay Tanyag will begin planting seedlings of Moringa oleifera on ten (10)

<p><span>The learning activities conducted at the
demonstration farm are the key catalyst for minimizing any social risks.  The technical risks are already minimal in
that the test growing has been ongoing since 2008 and the results are what we
have come to work with routinely.  For
instance the bedding area is well drained in the wet season, however irrigated
from in-ground saturation hoses so that in the dry season there is water.  Fertilizers and ‘pest pushers’ are all made
from leaves and branches of a combination of four trees also growing within the
project hectares.  Also, each seedling
has a companion tree, Gliricidia sepium that
is a legume and thereby always fixes nitrogen to the soil of each Moringa.  The legume is kept smaller than the Moringa
and its leaves are also mulched with others, such as the mulched leaves of the
banana tree that provide manganese which helps in the photosynthesis of the Moringa
leaves keeping them luscious green.  The
mulched leaves, seeds and branches of the Neem, Azadirachta indica, amazingly
pushes (repels) and/or interrupts the breeding cycles of more than 300
different kinds of insect pests without disturbing the beneficial insects such
as the pollinators or Ladybug nor the beneficial bacteria found within the soil
nor the earthworms.  The mulched leaves
of the Atis, Annona squamosa L., provide additional pest control.  All-in-all the Moringa oleifera grows well by
itself, but these processes make the commercial aspect of growing it for profit
a pleasure, not a burden.  </span></p>

Short Summary
The goal is to place a money making
methodology in front of poor farmers who can put it to use. 

Figure 1.  The eastern view of the valley at Tanyag about, 300 farms are visible.

The person behind the methodology is the
mentor, Joseph J. Reynolds.  He is passionate
about bringing back forests throughout the tropical world. 




Figure 2 Moringa seedlings, two months old"" 


The
     Moringa oleifera tree is highly productive and it produces income monthly on
     a sustainable basis.
The Moringa oleifera tree is highly productive
when cultivated properly and it produces income monthly on a sustainable
basis.  The profitability for the farmer
is more than ten times what his net earnings are from growing rice when
computed on a per square meter basis. 

Planting one Moringa will be equivalent to the
effectiveness of fifty (50) Japanese cedar trees in absorbing carbon.[1]



Marketing of the product uses the Internet to make direct consumer sales. 


The savings of eliminating the middlemen layers more for less achieves the paradigm shift.  And, commences reforesting.

Exponential
Reforestation

The
     More for Less Paradigm permits exponential reforestation to emerge.  First the farmer experiences a better
     way, next the idea spreads and spreads. 
     Those who might say that one product will not be feasible for so
     many growers and consumers are correct. 
     To solve that we have more than 300 more food source trees from
     which to select.
With
     regards to the beginning, i.e. Moringa oleifera:  When we grow 100,000 Moringa oleifera
     not only does the community of 900 farmers climb out of poverty the
     ecology benefits as if we had planted 2 million to 5 million trees of the
     other more general varieties.  
This
     campaign is the first outreach used to engage our agroforestry
     demonstration farm as the initial step to reforesting the Philippines.
The
     magnitude of what your contribution will help us, all of us, to achieve
     starts with this ongoing sole proprietorship model for replication, it is THE
     BEGINNING TO THE REFORESTATION OF THE PHILIPPINES THROUGH INCREMENTAL
     REPLICATION BY FARMERS AND ENTREPRENEURS WHO UNDERSTAND THAT THEY CAN EARN
     MORE FROM GROWING TREES THAN THEY CAN FROM TRADITIONAL MONOCROP FARMING. 
The
     Philippines needs to be reforested, it is basically agricultural, which is
     not alleviating poverty; of the millions of farmers, nearly all are poor. 
Growing
     Moringa oleifera at the demo-farm and in the adjacent community will provide
     a model for the other farmers to successfully grow trees that within one
     year provide a substantial increase in their incomes. 
The
     leaves of Moringa oleifera trees grown on 300 square meters are
     commercially more productive than growing rice on 15,000 square meters or
     50 times (50x) more profitable. 
In
     this example Moringa oleifera is the tree of choice and this plan provides
     the step-by-step process for rapidly winning over the farmer. The plan
     demonstrates how the Philippines can reforest incrementally and rapidly to
     help both the economy and the environment and thirdly, the consumer. The
     demonstration farm is on track to open in July/August of this year. There
     are more than 1,000 similar valleys on Mindoro that can replicate the
     project as a beginning. In concert with the Barangay of Tanyag in January
     2016 we are jointly planting 33,333 Moringa oleifera annually for three
     years on contiguous land provided by 100 farmers. The entire community of
     900 will share in the work and the profits.  The Philippines has over 7,000 islands
     and 42,000 barangays, the task requires exponential thinking and
     approaches but first it must be totally in-house from where it can reach
     outwardly.

What We Need & What You Get

We
Need
We require funding to meet the FDA[1]
licensing and health requirements including the respective labeling and packaging where we
will set our product apart from others by making authorized nutritional and
health benefit claims as we may.
We are on the verge of having a positive
cash flow which will be turned internally to meet our continuing requirements.  This outreach is to raise
us to the next level and permit us to step away from the ordinary and
customary, or traditional, marketing practices that keep prices higher than
they could be otherwise.  
We need to deal directly with the
consumer who needs to be our customer and partner.  Our product is a food with tremendous
nutrients so we need government certified/approved testing to enable us to make
such claims on our labeling.  
We need to get away from the present
practice of using a toll company and not being able to list the beneficial
claims of our product that we want our customers to know about.  
Your help by joining our membership will
enable us to complete these requirements in record time so that we can market
exclusively under our own brand using the Internet to create additional memberships
in furtherance of our reforestation efforts. 


What
You Get

1. 
You
receive membership in Hilltop Moringa Farms
2. 
You
receive recognition through our commemorative marble wall for tropical
reforestation.
3. 
You
may receive free product for one year.
4. 
You
may receive extra free product for one year.
5. 
You
may receive a wall certificate commemorating your participation in tropical
reforestation.
6. 
You
may receive a wall plaque commemorating your participation in tropical
reforestation.
Memberships guarantee that product
received by members is the finest and it is free.  The product is not for sale, it is a gift to
the membership that guarantees reforestation. 

Memberships lower our production cost through
efficient scheduling to meet our long-term gift requirements.
The savings are significant enough to
make our/your reforestation possible. 
Volume is built through lots of little
bits rather than bulk sales to a redistributor. 
Our gift is shipped to you monthly for a year’s supply ensuring
freshness.
The extra product gifted to you enables
you to spread the word when you either gift it to another or even sell it to
another.  In either event those
recipients also begin reforesting.
We do profit financially and our as the profits
grow the overall project will expand more rapidly from our internal funding. 
One reason we selected Moringa oleifera
to be our first product is that the existing worldwide research is extensive
and the very positive results are archived at the National Center for Biotechnology information(NCBI),United States National Library of Medicine(NLM),National
Institutes of Health,
Bethesda, Md., www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov › NCBI › Literature › PubMed
Central (PMC). 
It is from this repository of data that we substantiate
health/nutritional claims that we intend to place on our label with government
approval.

capsules; no label or claims.


Figure 5 No Claims, we will add appropriate and government approved claims."" 
The modest funding that we are seeking will overcome
     our immediate impediments to being fully independent.  It will begin the paradigm shift from
     the ordinary and customary sale of our product using middle companies, a
     process that requires keeping the consumer retail price very high and will
     bring all outsourced processes inside so we may exclusively label and make
     specific nutrition and health claims. 


Figure 6.   The kinds of claims that we want to make but first we must have the independent lab certification/report.


Funding
     that surpasses our immediate needs will speed our growth and the rapid
     reforestation may begin scaling up to exponential reforestation.

Extra
Value
Our gift to you as a new member has
special value for you, examine this:


Value,
      retail:  two orders of 60 capsules
      each, 500mg, per month, one-year is $514.68, your gift for membership.
The
      funds from the membership go to the support, maintenance, care, custody
      and control of one Moringa oleifera tree at the demonstration farm and to
      reforest.  
The
      proceeds from the sale of product produced by that tree far exceed the
      cost of the gift and the size of the gift to you is double your monthly
      requirement.  The value of the
      extra 60 capsules that you do not need is about $16.00 and you will have
      12 of them over the next year valued at 257.34 which allows you to
      sustain your membership indefinitely while personally benefiting from the
      health benefits that we are seeking to be able to claim on our own
      label.  
The
      funds that we receive will first go to qualify Hilltop Moringa oleifera
      leaf powder to make health and/or therapeutic claims on its label.  Beyond that goal the membership
      proceeds will go directly to the direct involvement of the community to
      grow 33,333 new seedlings each year for three years commencing in January
      2016 in partnership with Hilltop Moringa Farms.  
Proceeds
      from those producing trees will be used to enhance the public relations
      of the project to foster broader interest in the neighboring villages and
      others to observe the lessons of the demonstration farm and to create
      replication that leads to reforestation in other villages.  
The
      unwitting benefit is the carbon tradeoff. 
      
If
      we do not reach our goal of raising the required amount of money we will continue until we do.

   The Impact

The characteristics of the Moringa
oleifera tree are such that the 100,000 trees combined over their lifetime will
be able to offset 30,001.7 tons of CO2.[1]  The uncanny quantity and diverse nature of
the nutrients contained in Moringa oleifera are well documented and when
Hilltop Moringa Farms is able to make these credible claims about its
particular product line we will be able to grow, produce and provide products
exclusively from our own farms.  Our
products will avoid all middlemen.  The cost
of producing the product is absorbed from the membership dues and the excess “profit”
is for reforestation.

The
     growing area in Tanyag will be 10 hectares of community land.  Considering that the Moringa oleifera
     produces twenty to fifty times (20x to 50x) more CO2 extraction from the air than the
     Japanese Cedar and other general vegetation that planting 100,000 Moringa
     oleifera is the equivalent of between two to five million “regular” trees.[2]  From the memberships sought in this
     campaign the results should be the equivalent of three million trees per
     village for ten villages or 30,000,000 trees.
This
     project has everyone’s best interest at heart throughout the world, even
     those who do not believe in climate change mitigation or eating healthy
     food. The benefits from reforestation can only help us all and the
     benefits from making very healthy food available to the rising billion,
     likewise, can only help us all.

Figure 7 the original 10 Ilin Forester Families, still growing trees, since 1994, before Mr. Reynolds entered the picture in 1999, back right.

 The single most significant part of the
     project is replication.  Why?  Social psychology is at play here.  Only the farmers, particularly the poor
     farmers, can successfully reforest deforested lands that lay barren.  Any other way involves either the
     wealthy or the government using traditional methods that are far too
     costly and consistently wrought with failure.
""I began growing
     Mahogany trees in November 1999 when I first visited the 9,000 hectare,
     remote and mostly barren, island in the Philippines which was inhabited
     with 16,000 people, all subsistence farmers.” Is what Reynolds has told to
     so many, so many times over so many years and is willing to tell it so
     many more times?  He observed the
     lack of soil, fresh water and protection against the wind.  The logistics were a nightmare. He met
     30 local farmers who all belonged to the local forester’s association,
     interesting especially when considering that they had no training
     whatsoever in forestry.  The village
     (barangay) captain, who was his host, had spent three years working in
     Japan as a forester in one of Japan’s foreign assistance programs. When he
     returned to his roots on Ilin Island he planted Mahogany seeds with the
     money that he had earned.  His
     friends, the farmers, joined him and they formed a forestry association
     but they had no resources to buy even seeds.   “We selected 10 of the farmers and
     entered into agreements that our foundation would provide seedlings, which
     they would each plant on their land, maintain them, replace those that
     died and get paid for their labor; the trees however would remain the
     property of the foundation.” Reynolds recalls. 

As
     of this time the program has more than 50,000 mature Mahogany trees all growing
     and protected by the farmers themselves. 
     They know now about sustainability and that the monetary benefits
     will be for their grandchildren, they too know and appreciate that the
     sustainable forest benefits Mother Nature. 
     Each farmer took it upon himself to plant seedlings for himself from
     seeds that they scrounged and other farmers outside of the program also
     planted in a similar fashion until the total was close to double.  The nearly 100,000 trees continue to
     grow and so does our trust for one another.

Using Moringa oleifera as
the Tree of Choice

What
     it is that we offer for the poor farmer is a significantly higher earnings
     methodology that is regular and sustainable, unlike rice that has a
     150-day cycle before repeating its laborious self, time and time again?  On the low end this plan will increase
     the local farmer’s net income per square meter of P5.4 to P35.2 and
     subsequently to P70 (US $0.12 to $0.80 and subsequently to $1.59), an
     increase of more than 1,200%.  
This
     program varies by using a demonstration approach and changing from timber
     to food production.  The tree of
     choice rapidly provides highly nutritional leaves on a regular basis after
     only about six months.  The result
     is healthy food, cash flow and discretionary money for both the farmer and
     the project.  In time, after the
     basic needs of the farmer are met he will become a student and advocate of
     climate change mitigation.  At that
     point watch the reforestation take off exponentially, but for now let’s
     get him sustainable income from growing trees.

   Risks & Challenges  

The
primary risk is in the influence that soothsayers possess.  In particular the ones who say that it is too
good to be true.  
The
significant results from the anticipated growth of the trees is risky to sell
to the traditional farmer unless it is first demonstrated beyond doubt.  
Our
biggest challenge is to complete the demonstration farming cycle and show
through documentation that corresponds directly with the farmer’s hands-on
examination of the trees, their leaves, the harvesting, processing, packaging,
marketing, selling and generating positive cash flow that shows actual income
that exceeds what they are used to receiving from growing rice.  
Everything
is in place to be able to so demonstrate except for our being able to not have
to outsource the packaging and being able to make health claims, however, even
under the current co-packaging arrangement the farmer will still benefit with no
less than ten times (10x) his current net earnings from growing rice.  That is because he is paid for the wet matter
(leaves) as they are harvested from the trees. 
His share from the subsequent processing and sale of the finished
product is extra, an incentive to help see the process through to the
finish.  In order to make it possible for
him to earn the extra we must be able to label the project ourselves, with
claims.
At
the Hilltop Moringa Demonstration farm …..
· 
In
short, our greatest risk is in non-believers but our greatest barrier to that
influence is in presenting empirical data along with hands-on examination of
the process, the product and proof of income. 



Figure 9 the green highlight marks the intended area of Moringa oleifera to be planted, 100 meters by 1,000 (10 hectares).


Commencing
in January 2016 Hilltop Farmers’ Helper Demonstration Farm in partnership with
Barangay Tanyag will begin planting seedlings of Moringa oleifera on ten (10)
hectares of community designated land using the demonstrated biodiversified
method to produce commercial products. This second phase within Barangay Tanyag
will grow out 100,000 Moringa oleifera trees in three years. 


Figure 10 timing is perfect, high school and college students are learning about reforestation…


The learning activities conducted at the
demonstration farm are the key catalyst for minimizing any social risks.  The technical risks are already minimal in
that the test growing has been ongoing since 2008 and the results are what we
have come to work with routinely.  For
instance the bedding area is well drained in the wet season, however irrigated
from in-ground saturation hoses so that in the dry season there is water.  Fertilizers and ‘pest pushers’ are all made
from leaves and branches of a combination of four trees also growing within the
project hectares.  Also, each seedling
has a companion tree, Gliricidia sepium that
is a legume and thereby always fixes nitrogen to the soil of each Moringa.  The legume is kept smaller than the Moringa
and its leaves are also mulched with others, such as the mulched leaves of the
banana tree that provide manganese which helps in the photosynthesis of the Moringa
leaves keeping them luscious green.  The
mulched leaves, seeds and branches of the Neem, Azadirachta indica, amazingly
pushes (repels) and/or interrupts the breeding cycles of more than 300
different kinds of insect pests without disturbing the beneficial insects such
as the pollinators or Ladybug nor the beneficial bacteria found within the soil
nor the earthworms.  The mulched leaves
of the Atis, Annona squamosa L., provide additional pest control.  All-in-all the Moringa oleifera grows well by
itself, but these processes make the commercial aspect of growing it for profit
a pleasure, not a burden.  
Our
Current State of Readiness

We are
     already staffed and ready to move onto the paradigm shift.  
Our
     laboratory is equipped with four commercial grade dehumidifiers to enable
     the rapid indoor drying of leaves in 8 hours without the use of applied
     heat.  
Our
     pulverizer is industrial grade, South Korean made and can operate at constant
     temperature without overheating or otherwise being required to stop before
     whatever amount of leaves there are to be pulverized are completed.  The mesh size is #100, most competition
     is less at #65.  
We
     utilize tie-grid solar energy for our laboratory operations to assure
     start-to-finish processing is continuous and we are scheduled to step up our capacity. 
     
Our
     facilities are hygienic and meet government health standards for
     commercial food preparation.
Storage of the powder is maintained inside the climate
     controlled laboratory until shipped to the toll packaging company for
     encapsulating, labeling and packaging into sheets of 10 capsules each, 10
     sheets to a box and sealed and ready for distribution to the clientele. 

Our
     trees are ready for routine harvesting.        




Ordinary
and Customary Funding vs. Crowdfunding
The traditional way for projects to
proceed is to apply to large financial or development organizations and to
supply volumes of substantiation of endless details while asking for millions
of dollars and finally being rejected.
The crowdfunding way is to make a
common sense appeal to real people and gain their support, a little bit from
each contributor, and then apply the funds to the project and make it happen on
the basis of the amount of funds received. 
Our initial goal is small but most significant because it will allow us
to use a small amount to change our direction so that we can then earn millions
on our own and apply those funds to our overall goal.  Thanks for your incremental help, however
large or small.

Other Ways You Can Help 
If
you are not able to contribute through membership please do not shy away.  The mere fact that you are reading this means
it is of interest to you.  Tell us what
you can do to help us and good common sense will take it from there.  Even the useful common sense suggestion will get your name on the memorial
wall.  We would like to see your name there
and someday that will be as significant to the public as so many exceptional memorials are around the world.  
Please
help to get the word out.  Your help in sharing this with your network
whether tiny or large is all that we can ask, you do that and the rest will
happen.  Thanks.  
We read about Indiegogo and I first saw its value when observing one of
their campaigns that was a huge success in getting their very beneficial
product to both the public and to Mother Nature.  Please check the Indiegogo share tools!  In doing so the one additional interested
person may make the difference that we all need.  Thank you.",26.0,0,"2 Campaigns

Adopt Pennadomo, an
ancient Italian village in the hills of Abruzzo
An exciting project that helps
a community save and revitalize their 1,000 year old village in Abruzzo, Italy
The non-profit IK0
Foundation takes a unique approach to responsible tourism by helping local
people in Italian villages open up their own extraordinary range of small
business opportunities, while providing travellers’ with authentic experiences
in the countryside.  Pennadomo will
become an all-inclusive resort entirely developed, owned and managed by the
local population, thereby ensuring both the preservation of this ancient
village and employment for future local generations of this unique community.
The Foundation needs an
initial contribution to make the Pennadomo project happen.  Once this first village is revitalized, the
Foundation will become self-sustaining with profits generated by the project
and re-invested to support other ancient and declining villages across the
country.
Funding for Pennadomo will
create locally-owned and managed, sustainable businesses, including 56 boutique
hotel rooms, panoramic and traditional restaurants, a local specialties store
featuring products of the region, wine tasting, olive oil tasting in an old
mill, two Panini cafes, two bars and one artisanal shop, along with a botanical
garden, art gallery and a museum of the fairy tales of Abruzzo.

intellectual disabilities in the Oaza organization in Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Oaza Sarajevo, in cooperation with FIFH Malmö, MyRight and Special Olympics, organizes
large sports events for people with disabilities in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Oaza
Sarajevo and FIFH Malmö has managed to create incredibly impressive projects in
the eight years they have worked together.</p>
<p>This project is not only about physical education and sport.
It’s also about the right to a meaningful life and the right to grow and develop
as an individual. It’s also about creating a forum where people from different parts
of the community can come together. This creates an opportunity for people with
disabilities to participate in society as equal citizens. </p>
<p>We intend to continue to cooperate with Oaza in Bosnia and we
need to quickly gather 40 000 in order to fund the project!</p><p><br/></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1434479588/gb3eaxtlj7ag5g9dt62p.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><br/></p>
<p><b>Where will your money go?</b></p>
<p>MyRight has already agreed to fund the project but require an
initial participation fee of 4350€ before Oaza and FIFH are allowed to access the
grant. The money raised would be used for paying this fee.</p><p><br/></p>
<p><b>About the project</b></p>
<p>The ‘Oaza’ Sports Games and the
Games of the Special Olympics of Bosnia and Herzegovina were established in
2011. The length of the tournament is four days and persons with intellectual disabilities
have an opportunity to compete in eight sports: football, basketball, swimming,
bocci bowling, athletics, table tennis, bowling and MATP (Motor Activity Training
Program). The games have been organized consecutively for three years. Furthermore,
during these three years, a great number of people were involved in the implementation
of the games, whether it were the partners, volunteers, or parents of persons with
intellectual disabilities.</p>
<p>Having in mind the experience
gained in the last three years, during which a great number of people aided the
implementation and realization of the project, an idea was further developed. It
involved the youth population that are a active in different sports teams in the
Canton of Sarajevo, directly influencing the youngest demographic and raising awareness
in their understanding and attitudes towards persons with intellectual disabilities.
It was conceptualized that interactions between persons with intellectual disabilities
and the younger demographics are very likely to be established through sports encounters.</p>
<p>The aim of the project is that
through its realization, a chance is given to persons with intellectual disabilities
to develop through sports and active training, thus helping them achieve a higher
quality of life through the equalization of possibilities. This in accordance to
Article 30 of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. Through
acquired knowledge we have witnessed the importance of sport as an instrument in
integrating persons with intellectual disabilities in society, as well as enabling
the promotion of their rights. Sport is a means of decreasing prejudice towards
persons with intellectual disabilities and encouraging the development of their
rightful possibilities and capabilities.</p><p><br/></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1434479627/ikjtymmnhegvmgqisjr4.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><br/></p><p><b>Why is this project important?</b></p>
<p>Primarily, the objective of this
project is the inclusion of persons with intellectual disabilities in social activities
and their improved status in society. We have recognized the possibilities of sports
as a means to solving this issue. The main goal we want to achieve is for the attitudes
of the society to change towards persons with intellectual disabilities and the
opportunities they are offered; they should be allowed an equal, lawful position
in society. This is a responsibility because Bosnia and Herzegovina has signed the
UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. Through sports tournaments,
we have a chance to show the general public that persons with intellectual disabilities
can equally participate in social, cultural and sport life. Sports and sports tournaments
are a means through which we will establish common ground. Acquaintances between
persons with intellectual disabilities and persons without disabilities will consequently
demonstrate to the public that persons with intellectual disabilities are unjustifiably
neglected.</p>
<p>Besides this importance, sport
plays a role in the improvement of overall health of persons with intellectual disabilities,
their ability to work, self-confidence, and overall quality of life. Through this
project we plan to cooperate and target sports clubs so that we may be able to form
selections and teams which will include both persons with intellectual disabilities
and persons without disabilities.</p>

<br/></div>","This is a humanitarian response for vulnerable young people with
intellectual disabilities in the Oaza organization in Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Oaza Sarajevo, in cooperation with FIFH Malmö, MyRight and Special Olympics, organizes
large sports events for people with disabilities in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Oaza
Sarajevo and FIFH Malmö has managed to create incredibly impressive projects in
the eight years they have worked together.
This project is not only about physical education and sport.
It’s also about the right to a meaningful life and the right to grow and develop
as an individual. It’s also about creating a forum where people from different parts
of the community can come together. This creates an opportunity for people with
disabilities to participate in society as equal citizens. 
We intend to continue to cooperate with Oaza in Bosnia and we
need to quickly gather 40 000 in order to fund the project!
Where will your money go?
MyRight has already agreed to fund the project but require an
initial participation fee of 4350€ before Oaza and FIFH are allowed to access the
grant. The money raised would be used for paying this fee.
About the project
The ‘Oaza’ Sports Games and the
Games of the Special Olympics of Bosnia and Herzegovina were established in
2011. The length of the tournament is four days and persons with intellectual disabilities
have an opportunity to compete in eight sports: football, basketball, swimming,
bocci bowling, athletics, table tennis, bowling and MATP (Motor Activity Training
Program). The games have been organized consecutively for three years. Furthermore,
during these three years, a great number of people were involved in the implementation
of the games, whether it were the partners, volunteers, or parents of persons with
intellectual disabilities.
Having in mind the experience
gained in the last three years, during which a great number of people aided the
implementation and realization of the project, an idea was further developed. It
involved the youth population that are a active in different sports teams in the
Canton of Sarajevo, directly influencing the youngest demographic and raising awareness
in their understanding and attitudes towards persons with intellectual disabilities.
It was conceptualized that interactions between persons with intellectual disabilities
and the younger demographics are very likely to be established through sports encounters.
The aim of the project is that
through its realization, a chance is given to persons with intellectual disabilities
to develop through sports and active training, thus helping them achieve a higher
quality of life through the equalization of possibilities. This in accordance to
Article 30 of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. Through
acquired knowledge we have witnessed the importance of sport as an instrument in
integrating persons with intellectual disabilities in society, as well as enabling
the promotion of their rights. Sport is a means of decreasing prejudice towards
persons with intellectual disabilities and encouraging the development of their
rightful possibilities and capabilities.Why is this project important?
Primarily, the objective of this
project is the inclusion of persons with intellectual disabilities in social activities
and their improved status in society. We have recognized the possibilities of sports
as a means to solving this issue. The main goal we want to achieve is for the attitudes
of the society to change towards persons with intellectual disabilities and the
opportunities they are offered; they should be allowed an equal, lawful position
in society. This is a responsibility because Bosnia and Herzegovina has signed the
UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. Through sports tournaments,
we have a chance to show the general public that persons with intellectual disabilities
can equally participate in social, cultural and sport life. Sports and sports tournaments
are a means through which we will establish common ground. Acquaintances between
persons with intellectual disabilities and persons without disabilities will consequently
demonstrate to the public that persons with intellectual disabilities are unjustifiably
neglected.
Besides this importance, sport
plays a role in the improvement of overall health of persons with intellectual disabilities,
their ability to work, self-confidence, and overall quality of life. Through this
project we plan to cooperate and target sports clubs so that we may be able to form
selections and teams which will include both persons with intellectual disabilities
and persons without disabilities.

Cooperation
between Oaza and FIFH
The swedish organization FIFH
Malmö will, Malmo Open - one of the biggest competitions of its kind in the world,
provide security and stability in Project Oaza Sarajevo. FIFH will advise Oaza in
strategizing and planning the future for the Oaza Sports Games in Sarajevo to further
professionalization.
FIFH will be able to apply the
functional structure used in Sweden and use the knowledge, resources and contacts
gained through organizing Malmo Open to assist Oaza. The organization of FIFH will
act as a model for the construction of buildings and sustainable, long-term solutions.
Oaza athletes gain experience
and vast improvements in terms of sports right in Malmo Open. They get a chance
to compete with the people from all around the globe and prove their skills internationally.

<p>A typical day for me involves going to work for 8+ hours and
then when I get home from work I make dinner for my family and then I make
soap.  My days are typically 18+ hour
days and I am not complaining at all!  I
am saying, however, that these days can be exhausting and it would be my dream
at some point to just focus on growing Squeaky Suds, rather than working a full
day before I get to come home and focus on what I love. Our production is very small scale at this
time.  Our production area consists of a
corner of our kitchen. And our storage area is one small corner of our family
room.  We are currently preparing to sell
Squeaky Suds at a local farmers market and so that has been our most recent
focus.  My family is 100% supportive of the Squeaky
Suds dream!  In fact , my children have
become very passionate about our dream.

 to Precious Metals Bullion and Vault, LLC, a premier <b>gold, silver</b>, 
platinum and palladium precious metals dealer. My name is Dale Olmstead,
 manager of PMB&amp;V, located in the beautiful Pacific Northwest of the
 United States of America. In this campaign, I am excited to introduce a
 new concept in spending:  <b>using precious metals as money!</b> </p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1435798890/erhos5xq5ikkoc2wwg48.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p>    Gold and silver have been around since the beginnings of money 
and trade, consistently <b>retaining their purchasing power</b>. Commonly used as money in early America, it is  clearly stated in the U.S. Constitution that, ( Article 
1, section 10) ""only gold and silver are to be used as money""! But of 
course, no one actually goes to the grocery store or buys shoes with 
silver and gold anymore! No store is prepared to handle the exchange of precious
 metals as money. We are excited at PMB&amp;V to announce that we have developed a way to do just that, harnessing the purchasing power of gold and silver through a <b>
Precious Metals Access Card</b> (PMAC)! A <b>precious metals backed debit card</b> that can be used to purchase 
products and services <b>wherever Visa is accepted</b>, allowing the easy use 
of precious metals as money.</p><p align=""center""><b>OUR STORY</b><br/></p><p>    Let me give you a
 bit of my personal history. I have worked in the fine jewelry industry 
for 35 years as a journeyman jeweler. In 1985, I established my own 
business, Olmstead's Fine Jewelry, (which later evolved into XS 
Wholesale Jewelers) and have enjoyed the trade and our customer 
relationships very much. This experience has laid the foundation for me 
to now manage <b>Precious Metals Bullion &amp; Vault</b>. <br/></p><p>    In 2001-2002, I 
began to notice the value of gold starting on an upward price move, 
doubling in value from $250 to $500! I asked myself, ""If my product 
price just doubled, why did my income not?"" This thought stirred a new 
interest in the precious metals market for me and I quickly became a 
student of the
 exciting history of precious metals. What I discovered was very clear, 
precious metals <b>do hold</b> their purchasing power. In 1964, a 90% silver quarter could
 purchase a gallon of gasoline. Interestingly, at today's precious 
metals values, PMB&amp;V can liquidate that same 90% constitutional coin
 for fiat dollars and a gallon of gas can still be purchased for that 
same twenty five cent coin of constitutional money! We can go even 
further back to biblical times and see that, at that time, an ounce of 
gold would clothe a man nicely-again, at today's gold prices, an 
ounce of gold would still clothe a man very nicely! <i><b>History FACT has proven 
time and time again that precious metals hold their purchasing power over fiat 
paper / digital currency.</b></i><span style=""background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);""> <br/></span></p><p><span style=""background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);"">    In 2005, a few of
 my clients began asking about buying precious metals, 
looking for ways to protect their hard earned monies through <b>wealth preservation</b>. As I listened to their concerns regarding the <b>debt dollar 
paradigm</b> pendulum correcting itself back to center,  and the very real 
concern of the purchasing power of the dollar <b>dropping to zero</b> (Fact: like all other 
fiat currencies in history before it), I began to see that the only 
true, <b>constant and secure wealth remains in precious metals</b>. I had 
always been buying precious metals for my jewelry trade but not with the
 understanding of the monetary aspects in the actual value of owning 
precious metals. I began accumulating precious metals at that time, 
closely watching the markets and studying other successful individuals 
in the precious metals community. When asked by clients, ""How can I buy 
silver or gold?"", I realized that I myself could begin to provide this 
<b>added service </b>(instead of sending them to a local coin shop) and I 
became a precious metals dealer, helping others to preserve and protect 
their wealth. </span></p><p><span style=""background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);""></span></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""435"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FBNoJPG3wR5g%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DBNoJPG3wR5g&amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FBNoJPG3wR5g%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube"" width=""580""></iframe></div>        <br/><p></p><p><span style=""background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);"">    Something I 
learned long ago in my early business years is that <b>service above and 
beyond</b> your competition generates great success and good referrals. I practice this today in managing<b> Precious Metals Bullion &amp; Vault</b> and have developed a very 
successful business model. <br/></span></p><p><span style=""background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);"">    In addition to helping people with their <b>
wealth preservation</b> through the purchasing of precious metals, it became
 clear that at some point, people would want and need to<b> 
access their wealth to use their metals as money.</b>  The traditional 
way to exchange metal for money is to go to your secure location, 
estimate what you are going to need to exchange for currency, find a 
dealer who will be willing to make the exchange and finally deposit the 
funds in the bank in order to have access to your wealth. I used this same service with my clients wishing there was an easier,faster way. <br/></span></p><p><span style=""background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);"">    As I committed myself to becoming the best student possible of the precious metals industry, I attended the Silver Summit 2011, held right here in my hometown of Spokane Washington. The speakers included some highly successful and widely renowned experts in the industry including Eric Sprott and David Morgan. This very topic of accessing metals was being discussed by one of the keynote speakers, <span></span><b> David Morgan </b>(who is now a good friend and colleague and a PMAC system client). He addressed from stage stating, <b>""Some day someone is going to offer you a debit 
card and when you purchase something, it will account for selling just 
enough silver to pay for that debit""</b>. I thought to myself, ""This is the 'added service' I need to go above and beyond my 
competition to provide the best possible service to my clients!"" As he 
finished his talk, I jumped up on stage to 
meet him asking, ""Where do I get some of these cards? Who has done this 
and how do I get in touch with
 him?"" His response was, ""Let me get out from behind the podium, 
they need to introduce the next speaker! Meet me at my table and I'll 
answer all your questions!"" Once outside, David informed me,""I don't 
know of anyone who has done it! I have tried and many others have also, 
but no one has been able to succeed!"" That was the beginning of many 
sleepless nights, (like the one now, as I type this out for my 
campaign!) I began writing out ideas, interviewing with bankers, 
searching the Internet for like products and services to no avail, I found no successful program available, anywhere. <br/></span></p><p><span style=""background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);"">    The very next week, I contacted the 
three local banks with whom  I was doing business and then some of 
the larger institutions in town. It was slow and difficult for them to 
grasp the concept of how to incorporate this idea to work within their 
current systems. I was disappointed with how long it would take (4-6 
weeks!) to process a single account! During this process, I randomly received a flyer in the mail from Mountain West Bank, who had recently established a branch near my place of business. I attended a meet and greet with the branch manager at the time, who 
introduced me to the business accounts manager, and in an hours time, I left carrying with me my <b>first precious metals debit cards</b>!</span></p><p><span style=""background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);""><b>    </b>After about six months of beta testing and

 to Precious Metals Bullion and Vault, LLC, a premier gold, silver, 
platinum and palladium precious metals dealer. My name is Dale Olmstead,
 manager of PMB&V, located in the beautiful Pacific Northwest of the
 United States of America. In this campaign, I am excited to introduce a
 new concept in spending:  using precious metals as money!     Gold and silver have been around since the beginnings of money 
and trade, consistently retaining their purchasing power. Commonly used as money in early America, it is  clearly stated in the U.S. Constitution that, ( Article 
1, section 10) ""only gold and silver are to be used as money""! But of 
course, no one actually goes to the grocery store or buys shoes with 
silver and gold anymore! No store is prepared to handle the exchange of precious
 metals as money. We are excited at PMB&V to announce that we have developed a way to do just that, harnessing the purchasing power of gold and silver through a 
Precious Metals Access Card (PMAC)! A precious metals backed debit card that can be used to purchase 
products and services wherever Visa is accepted, allowing the easy use 
of precious metals as money.OUR STORY    Let me give you a
 bit of my personal history. I have worked in the fine jewelry industry 
for 35 years as a journeyman jeweler. In 1985, I established my own 
business, Olmstead's Fine Jewelry, (which later evolved into XS 
Wholesale Jewelers) and have enjoyed the trade and our customer 
relationships very much. This experience has laid the foundation for me 
to now manage Precious Metals Bullion & Vault.     In 2001-2002, I 
began to notice the value of gold starting on an upward price move, 
doubling in value from $250 to $500! I asked myself, ""If my product 
price just doubled, why did my income not?"" This thought stirred a new 
interest in the precious metals market for me and I quickly became a 
student of the
 exciting history of precious metals. What I discovered was very clear, 
precious metals do hold their purchasing power. In 1964, a 90% silver quarter could
 purchase a gallon of gasoline. Interestingly, at today's precious 
metals values, PMB&V can liquidate that same 90% constitutional coin
 for fiat dollars and a gallon of gas can still be purchased for that 
same twenty five cent coin of constitutional money! We can go even 
further back to biblical times and see that, at that time, an ounce of 
gold would clothe a man nicely-again, at today's gold prices, an 
ounce of gold would still clothe a man very nicely! History FACT has proven 
time and time again that precious metals hold their purchasing power over fiat 
paper / digital currency.     In 2005, a few of
 my clients began asking about buying precious metals, 
looking for ways to protect their hard earned monies through wealth preservation. As I listened to their concerns regarding the debt dollar 
paradigm pendulum correcting itself back to center,  and the very real 
concern of the purchasing power of the dollar dropping to zero (Fact: like all other 
fiat currencies in history before it), I began to see that the only 
true, constant and secure wealth remains in precious metals. I had 
always been buying precious metals for my jewelry trade but not with the
 understanding of the monetary aspects in the actual value of owning 
precious metals. I began accumulating precious metals at that time, 
closely watching the markets and studying other successful individuals 
in the precious metals community. When asked by clients, ""How can I buy 
silver or gold?"", I realized that I myself could begin to provide this 
added service (instead of sending them to a local coin shop) and I 
became a precious metals dealer, helping others to preserve and protect 
their wealth.             Something I 
learned long ago in my early business years is that service above and 
beyond your competition generates great success and good referrals. I practice this today in managing Precious Metals Bullion & Vault and have developed a very 
successful business model.     In addition to helping people with their 
wealth preservation through the purchasing of precious metals, it became
 clear that at some point, people would want and need to 
access their wealth to use their metals as money.  The traditional 
way to exchange metal for money is to go to your secure location, 
estimate what you are going to need to exchange for currency, find a 
dealer who will be willing to make the exchange and finally deposit the 
funds in the bank in order to have access to your wealth. I used this same service with my clients wishing there was an easier,faster way.     As I committed myself to becoming the best student possible of the precious metals industry, I attended the Silver Summit 2011, held right here in my hometown of Spokane Washington. The speakers included some highly successful and widely renowned experts in the industry including Eric Sprott and David Morgan. This very topic of accessing metals was being discussed by one of the keynote speakers,  David Morgan (who is now a good friend and colleague and a PMAC system client). He addressed from stage stating, ""Some day someone is going to offer you a debit 
card and when you purchase something, it will account for selling just 
enough silver to pay for that debit"". I thought to myself, ""This is the 'added service' I need to go above and beyond my 
competition to provide the best possible service to my clients!"" As he 
finished his talk, I jumped up on stage to 
meet him asking, ""Where do I get some of these cards? Who has done this 
and how do I get in touch with
 him?"" His response was, ""Let me get out from behind the podium, 
they need to introduce the next speaker! Meet me at my table and I'll 
answer all your questions!"" Once outside, David informed me,""I don't 
know of anyone who has done it! I have tried and many others have also, 
but no one has been able to succeed!"" That was the beginning of many 
sleepless nights, (like the one now, as I type this out for my 
campaign!) I began writing out ideas, interviewing with bankers, 
searching the Internet for like products and services to no avail, I found no successful program available, anywhere.     The very next week, I contacted the 
three local banks with whom  I was doing business and then some of 
the larger institutions in town. It was slow and difficult for them to 
grasp the concept of how to incorporate this idea to work within their 
current systems. I was disappointed with how long it would take (4-6 
weeks!) to process a single account! During this process, I randomly received a flyer in the mail from Mountain West Bank, who had recently established a branch near my place of business. I attended a meet and greet with the branch manager at the time, who 
introduced me to the business accounts manager, and in an hours time, I left carrying with me my first precious metals debit cards!    After about six months of beta testing and 
developing the metal tracking software, we launched the PMB&V, LLC in February of 2012. This
 is why we believe that we are the original, first to market, and still the only working precious 
metals debit card system, able to be used wherever Visa is accepted. We 
call this the PMAC (Precious Metals Access Card) system allowing instant
 access to the purchasing power of your precious metals through the Visa network 
world wide.        We believe that 
our clients should be in control of their money and wealth. Precious 
Metals Bullion & Vault would like to help you:

Secure goods and services in the future for yesterdays and today's values. 

Preserve
 what is yours.

Protect your wealth for future generations.

Defend our CONSTITUTIONAL money. 


Promote
 what we believe; that precious metals, in this unstable world, are the 
most sound and reliable place to secure your resources, and with your 
PMAC (Precious Metals Access Card) you can now access your wealth 
anytime and anywhere Visa is accepted!

HOW IT WORKS    With our system of precious metals holding accounts, one can virtually buy, pay and/or settle any debt, public or private with precious metals. It works like this: 1. To Sign Up and open any one of the four types of precious metals holding accounts download the application from our web site and send it in: PreciousMetalsAccessCard.com 

Silver (our most popular) 


Gold 

Platinum 

Palladium
2. Fund your new precious metals holding account with purchased metals fromPMB&V, fiat currency (cash) or your personal precious metals (subject to approval).3. You then will be issued a PMAC that can be used where ever Visa is accepted.    A Precious Metals Holding account with PMB&V is very unique. You actually have a precious metals holding with cash availability all in one account. In your dual purpose holding account, your currency will always be used first to settle debits. Your precious metals act as an overdraft protection and/or savings account. When the currency in the holding account is depleted, then, and only then, will PMB&V sell just enough precious metal from your holdings to settle any debits. Because of market volatility PMB&V reserves the right to adjust it's premiums to buy and sell  into the physical market not just using the managed COMEX spot cash price of the day.    Your precious metal holding account is Protected:
No commingling of funds from other holding accounts is ever allowed, meaning  your cash is segregated and never mixed with any other holding accounts. 
Your precious metals are fully insured while in PMB&V's custody, meaning, if there is a loss it will be replaced with like kind at time of loss. 
Also, for transparency, we have a monthly independent audit to confirm that the precious metals inventory equals or is greater than all of the account holders precious metals inventories. The results of this audit are sent out with your monthly statement.
OUR CAMPAIGN    Up
 until now PMB&V and XS Wholesale Jewelers have been sharing a 
retail office space of only 500 square feet. We are, to say the least, 
literally tripping over each other at times and it has become necessary 
to find other accommodations for PMB&V! Our consistent rate of growth and increased need for
 secured storage and office space is pushing us to expand! We have found the ideal location to take Precious Metals Bullion & Vault to the next level! After much

and provide the ideal place for PMB&V's growth and expansion! This location previously housed a large,  privately owned security firm. There are two fully secured, walk in vaults and plenty of room for more, as 
well as ample office space. The asking price of the building
 is below taxed assess value and exceeds every need we can see for the 
future. We believe it is the building we have been searching for.     We 
desire to practice sound money disciplines in not only our business 
concept and conduct, but in the funding of our growth as we want to 
provide consistency in honest and sound money principles, both 
personally and in business.




    Our
 campaign therefore, is to help us avoid using the 'debt dollar' system 
(getting a loan from a large financial institution) and help us to 
purchase the location that we need to continue promoting sound money 
principles through precious metals and the use of the PMAC system.     We
 would like to go ahead with the purchase of this property but do not

But the most important investment would be in creating an addition to my range - Wood Wick candles and Candles with Crystals - You may say, ""this has been done before"", BUT not the creative way I can make them, my prices are most definitely affordable and my fragrances are unforgettable, which is attractive to a candle buyer.</p><p>My Candles are Soy and/or Palm Wax (certified) candles that provide unforgettable fragrances to fill your home for any mood/environment.  Perfect for relaxation/meditation or for a unique and cosy home décor with many creative styles of candles to choose from, including assorted jar sizes, assorted pillars sizes, custom made candles, CHAKRA candles just to name a few.</p><p>I have worked hard on this small business of mine and want to expand, to expand I need some help with funding.  I want to give this everything I can, because I know I have fantastic ideas and great motivation to succeed.

I have always loved and been good at making things with my hands, I have tried other jobs since my technician job to make money to invest in my business, which has got my this far, but now I would like to strive for more and I have some great ideas I would love to bring to reality, I just need some help with funding.  I started my small candle business -SoyfortheSoul Candles - nearly two years ago and am still very passionate about it.  I have a great following and customer base online and on facebook and continually try to amaze my customers with unique soy or palm wax candle creations, and I would love to expand my presence .This campaign is important to me as is the success of bringing my dreams closer to reality.  With this funding I would be able to purchase the tools I need to be a unique presence in  market places and online, such as buying market tables, acceptable waterproof overhead coverings, and shelving.  I have also previously had my candles in handmade gift stores - and would also like to invest in being able to provide my own shop displays with my products.  This funding would also help in the upgrade of my website, which is important when approaching the online shopping community. But the most important investment would be in creating an addition to my range - Wood Wick candles and Candles with Crystals - You may say, ""this has been done before"", BUT not the creative way I can make them, my prices are most definitely affordable and my fragrances are unforgettable, which is attractive to a candle buyer.My Candles are Soy and/or Palm Wax (certified) candles that provide unforgettable fragrances to fill your home for any mood/environment.  Perfect for relaxation/meditation or for a unique and cosy home décor with many creative styles of candles to choose from, including assorted jar sizes, assorted pillars sizes, custom made candles, CHAKRA candles just to name a few.I have worked hard on this small business of mine and want to expand, to expand I need some help with funding.  I want to give this everything I can, because I know I have fantastic ideas and great motivation to succeed. Of course as a contributor helping me achieve my goal, you wont go unnoticed, I will be most grateful for any consideration you have for my ideas.What We Need & What You GetI am asking for $5000 in funding for the following tools
$2000 on stock, example - wax, Jars, wicks, fragrance, dyes, melting pots, packaging and labelling.. 
$2000 for Market Place tools, such as tables, storage, shelving, undercover protection
$1000 on my new products - Wood Wick Candles and Candles with Crystals!!
I do have perks involved for contributing!
If I don't reach my goal I would still like to put the funds into my website and creating my new wood wick and Crystal candles, so I can provide my customers and candle lovers with more ways to relax after that long day.
Risks & Challenges I know there are risks involved in trying to expand this candle business, as there is competition out there.  However, I am confident I can rise to be one of, if not the best small candle business, because I am creative and fresh, I have great unique ideas and people who buy from me say they have never seen or been able to buy candles like them.  I am also flexible with my customers and offer them custom make option and refill options of a custom kind.Other Ways You Can HelpSome people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean you can't help:

<p>          <b>Natural Handmade Ice Cream</b> from an amazing
original recipe and process. This is something completely different from your current
concept of “Ice-Cream”. When people try it, they often say they feel like they
are discovering ice cream for the first time! The base of this ice cream has
its own intensive and delicious taste. It is made from all-natural creams
without any stabilizer, chemical flavoring or coloring. With only natural
nuts and fruits, it is an absolutely unforgettable experience. People rave
about two flavors in particular, <b>“Salty Sailor”</b> and (yes, you read it right)
<b>“Cheese Please”</b>.</p>

<p>          My famous<b> Cherry “Small Pockets”</b> are derived from traditional Finish
cuisine. Once while in Finland, I sampled some Finish bakery with cherry. It
was good, but as is my habit, I immediately began to imagine ways make the
taste bolder and more intense. After extensive experimentation, this
traditional dish was transformed into my famous Cherry “Small Pockets” made
with (among other things) cherry juice instead of water. Once I'd found the
perfect balance, people loved it.</p>

<p>My name is Taras, and e<span>ver since I can remember, I've been
fascinated with cooking. As a toddler I pulled pots and pans out of the
cupboard and pretended to cook. By the age of 8, I was already pestering my
mother in the kitchen, peering between her oven mitts. Once I even tried to
grab a hot tray! Under her watchful eye, I began to cook. First following her
instructions carefully, and then experimenting on my own.</span></p>
<p>          While other kids
played war games and pretended to kill each other, I wanted nothing more than
to bake and cook. I soon began to experiment with my own creations. These early
experiments in cuisine enjoyed varying degrees of success.  Some were popular with my family, while in
fairness, others became more notorious than anything else.</p>
<p>          After high school, I went to culinary college and finished my full 3-year studies within 2 years with distinction. I became a trained Chef and continued my experiments on a new level as a professional.<br/></p>
<p>          An area of interest
and recurring theme that arose during my evolution as a chef, are what I call
“resurrected recipes”. I love to find old recipes that have fallen out of favor,
and make them au courant. They say that everything comes around again. As with
fashion, some rediscovered recipes should really be left right where they are
found, banned to the annals of “bad idea to begin with”. However, occasionally,
even stunningly, others are real gems have somehow been mysteriously lost through
no fault of their own. In the case of my more successful dishes of this sort,
only Father Time knows why they were lost through the generations.</p>
<p>          Finding a hidden
gem like this has become my passion. Every chef has some “go-to” favorites that
they know they can rely on to elicit the magic the requisite moment requires,
and these quality offerings through<b> FARBO Café</b>, are mine.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1441384699/nkttw2tpkejmowmmri1b.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>          One of the other guiding stars I've realized
through years of experimentation and experience is that food must be made from
natural products. It is critical to prepare everything with only the best
and most natural products available. In all areas of gastronomy, the whole
really can be greater than the sum-of-the parts <b>IF</b> you begin with the very finest ingredients and apply some magic
and craft but if you don't start correctly with the best ingredients, no spell
or trick you can conjure in the kitchen will change the reality of “garbage in,
garbage out”.</p>
<p>          As such, I strive to create food that is
perfectly balanced and healthy, in addition to being delicious. Even good baked
items, if made with an eye for balance, can be part of a balanced diet that
won’t pile on the pounds AND delicious. Unfortunately we now live in an
industrialized and myopic food culture from GMO to the ridiculous amounts of
preservatives we ingest each year, where cheap tricks reign -such as simply
piling on the sugar in the form of cheap but unhealthy corn syrup, for example,
or ridiculous amounts of sodium and other preservatives while skimping on the
more satisfying and delicious natural sugars and tastes available only in
fruits and other quality natural ingredients.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1441385949/kosjszmwlxmtzhh2ogty.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>          What gives my passion for cuisine true meaning,
is sharing it with other people. Only then does it take on ultimate value for
me. I want to create my own café to share the results of my long research and
bring new ideas and great tastes to people around me.</p>
<p>          My direct experience has taught me the
importance of a focus on quality for not only food, but every aspect of life.
New experiences are like splashes of color in an otherwise faded world. New
experiences bring color to our life. That why I am creating<b> FARBO Café</b>.</p>

<p>          To create<b> FARBO Café</b> I need <b>68.000

take me many years if I do it on my own. I believe that with your help I can
reach my goal faster and without any question do much more good in the world
than simply getting a loan from the bank. In addition to bringing my delicious
and healthy products to the world, I will be able to help educate and feed
people who really need it rather than feeding other greedy and mythical “animals”
like Angels, Dragons and fat-cat bankers!</p>
<p>          Here on <b>Indiegogo</b>, as well as on<b>
Facebook, Twitter and YouTube</b> my supporters will get up-to-date pictures, a

<p>            <b>Natürliches handgemachtes Eis</b> schonend hergestellt nach einem großartigen Originalrezept. Wenn Ihr denkt Eis zu kennen dann habt Ihr unseres noch nicht probiert! Viele die in den Genuss gekommen sind es zu kosten, sagten es war „ein neues Geschmackserlebnis“, „als hätten sie zum ersten Mal Eis gegessen“… Das liegt vor allem an der Basis, den Ingredienzien, unserer köstlichen aromatischen Eiscreme. Sie wird ausschließlich aus natürlichen Zutaten hergestellt, enthält keine Stabilisatoren, chemischen Aroma- oder Farbstoffe. Verfeinert mit knackigen Nüssen und frischen Früchten ist unser Eis ein absolut unvergessliches Erlebnis. Unsere Gäste schwärmen vor allem von zwei Geschmacksrichtungen <b>“Salty Sailor”</b> und <b>“Cheese Please”</b>.</p>

<p>          Meine berühmten <b>""Kirschtäschchen""</b> entstammen der traditionellen finnischen Küche. Während einer Finnlandreise habe ich diverse finnische Kirsch-Backwaren probiert. Ich fand sie gut, doch etwas fehlte. Da kulinarisches Tüfteln zu meinem Naturell gehört überlegte ich mir gleich wie man den Geschmack intensivieren und abrunden könnte. Nach einer langen Versuchsreihe kreierte ich aus den traditionellen finnischen Kirsch-Backwaren etwas Neues: meine berühmten „Kirschtäschchen“, die u.A. mit Kirschsaft statt Wasser zubereitet werden. Einmal die richtige Geschmacksbalance gefunden, begannen die Leute sie zu lieben.</p>

Wir bieten echte Grün- und Schwarztees, ohne Staub oder Farbstoffe, an. Aber auch Pu-Erh, Oolong, Longjing und viele weitere Sorten stehen in unseren Regalen. Nur die besten und authentischsten Tees, schaffen es in unser Sortiment. Und das ist heutzutage keine Selbstverständlichkeit!

<p>Mein Name ist Taras. Seit ich denken kann übt Kochen eine besondere Faszination auf mich aus.
Als Kleinkind zog ich Töpfe und Pfannen aus dem Schrank und habe so getan als ob ich kochen würde. Im Alter von 8, nervte ich meine Mutter in der Küche und spielte mit allen möglichen Küchenutensilien. Einmal habe ich sogar versucht ein heißes Backbleck anzufassen! Unter ihren wachsamen Augen fing ich langsam an zu kochen. Zuerst befolgte ich genau ihre Anweisungen, doch im Laufe der Zeit begann ich selbst zu experimentieren.</p>
<p>          Während andere Kinder Kriegsspiele spielten und vorgaben sich gegenseitig zu töten, wollte ich nichts weiter als backen und kochen. Bald wagte ich mich an eigene Kreationen heran. Diese frühen kulinarischen Versuchsreihen waren von unterschiedlichen Erfolgen gekrönt. Einige kamen nur sehr gut bei meiner Familie an, während andere auch außerhalb der eigenen vier Wände berühmt- berüchtigt wurden.</p>
<p>          Nach meinem Schulabschluss besuchte ich eine 3- jährige kulinarische Hochschule und schloss diese bereits nach 2 Jahren ab. Danach konnte ich, als offiziell anerkannter Profi, meine experimentellen Versuche auf einem wesentlich höheren Niveau fortsetzten.<br/></p>
<p>          Ein Thema, das immer wieder eine Rolle in meinem Arbeitsleben spielt und während meiner Entwicklung zum Profi dominant wurde, ist jenes das ich „wiederbelebte Rezepte“ nenne. Ich liebe es, alte Rezepte, die in Ungnade gefallen sind auszugraben, und sie zu revitalisieren. Man sagt, dass alles irgendwann wiederkommt. Wie bei der Mode, sollten einige wiederentdeckte Rezepte wirklich genau dort bleiben wo sie hergekommen sind: in der Versenkung. Doch gelegentlich lassen sich unter ihnen echte kulinarische Juwelen entdecken, die lange verloren zu sein schienen, und die, nachdem sie durch meine liebevollen Hände gingen, in neuem Glanz erstrahlten.</p>
<p>          Die Suche nach solch verschollenen Schätzen hat meine Leidenschaft geweckt. Jeder Koch hat seine ganz persönlichen Favoriten, bei welchen er sich darauf verlassen kann, dass sie dem Genussmoment eine einzigartige magische Wirkung verleihen. Auch ich darf solch wundervolle Erzeugnisse mein Eigen nennen und möchte diese nun in Form meines ganz persönlichen Sortiments im <b>FARBO Café</b> anbieten.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1441384699/nkttw2tpkejmowmmri1b.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>          Ich bin im Laufe der Jahre und nach etlichen Experimenten zur Erkenntnis gelangt, dass Lebensmittel ausschließlich aus Naturprodukten hergestellt werden sollten.
In diesem Zusammenhang ist eine sorgfältige Auswahl der hochwertigsten Naturprodukte von essentieller Bedeutung. In allen Bereichen der Gastronomie ist das große Ganze bedeutender als die Summe aller Teile, sofern man mit den besten Zutaten beginnt und etwas Magie sowie handwerkliches Geschick hinzufügt. Doch wenn am Anfang minderwertige Zutaten stehen, so kann auch die beste „Zauberformel“ zu keinem guten Ergebnis mehr führen. Ganz nach dem Motto: „garbage in, garbage out“.</p>
<p>          Unter diesem Aspekt strebe ich danach Produkte zu kreieren, die ausgewogen, gesund und darüber hinaus köstlich sind. Selbst Backwaren können, wenn man auf die richtige Balance der Zutaten achtet, Teil einer ausgewogenen, gesunden Ernährung sein und noch dazu hervorragend schmecken. Leider leben wir momentan in einer Welt, die von einer industrialisierten und kurzsichtigen Esskultur dominiert wird. Voller gentechnisch veränderter Lebensmittel, ganz zu schweigen von den Unmengen an Konservierungsstoffen, die wir Jahr für Jahr zu uns nehmen. Eine Welt in der billige Tricks regieren – wie zum Beispiel die Verwendung von minderwertigem Zucker in Form von billigem und ungesundem Maissirup, oder unnötig hohen Mengen an Natrium und anderen Konservierungsstoffen, während mit dem wesentlich gesünderen Fruchtzucker und anderen hochwertigen natürlichen Inhaltsstoffen viel zu sparsam umgegangen wird.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1441385949/kosjszmwlxmtzhh2ogty.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>          Was meiner Leidenschaft für die Küche wahre Bedeutung verleiht ist es diese mit anderen Menschen zu teilen. Erst dann stellt sie auch einen Wert für mich dar. Ich möchte mein eigenes Café eröffnen, um die Ergebnisse meiner lang andauernden Forschung unters Volk zu bringen, innovative Kreationen zu liefern und den Menschen neue Geschmackserlebnisse zu bieten.</p>
<p>          Meine unmittelbare Erfahrung hat mir gezeigt, dass der Fokus auf Qualität, nicht nur in Bezug auf Lebensmittel, sondern auch für jeden Aspekt im Leben, von enormer Bedeutung ist. Neue Erfahrungen sind die Farbtupfer in einer sonst so fahlen Welt. Sie bringen Farbe in unser Leben. Der Grund, warum ich <b>FARBO Café</b> ins Leben rufen möchte.</p>

           We are ready to bring FARBO Café to
the people of Austria,                               and we need your help to make it happen!



Support this project by buying a “Pre-Order” Perk. You
can use it in FARBO Café anytime you like in future,
Or receive our best Coffee Beans or Tea Leaves sent directly to your home (see more below),
Or choose anything else you like from our Perks listed to the right. →






Our top quality offerings:

          At Farbo Café we offer many quality
products for our guests.  A small
sampling of these products are described below:


FARBO 
Quality Offering #1 - Ice Cream







          Natural Handmade Ice Cream from an amazing
original recipe and process. This is something completely different from your current
concept of “Ice-Cream”. When people try it, they often say they feel like they
are discovering ice cream for the first time! The base of this ice cream has
its own intensive and delicious taste. It is made from all-natural creams
without any stabilizer, chemical flavoring or coloring. With only natural
nuts and fruits, it is an absolutely unforgettable experience. People rave
about two flavors in particular, “Salty Sailor” and (yes, you read it right)
“Cheese Please”.

FARBOQuality Offering #2 – Pastry “Small Pockets”


          My famous Cherry “Small Pockets” are derived from traditional Finish
cuisine. Once while in Finland, I sampled some Finish bakery with cherry. It
was good, but as is my habit, I immediately began to imagine ways make the
taste bolder and more intense. After extensive experimentation, this
traditional dish was transformed into my famous Cherry “Small Pockets” made
with (among other things) cherry juice instead of water. Once I'd found the
perfect balance, people loved it.




FARBOQuality Offering #3 – Coffee Specialty Beans






          FARBO’s coffee (Third Wave) is brewed from beans
which come from farmers who only collect ripe coffee cherries on organic
plantations, which they work lovingly by hand. Business with them is conducted
under the direct Fair Trade model recognized across the world. The result is
simply the BEST coffee beans from roasters who refuse to sell beans that are
not of the highest roasting quality.



FARBOQuality Offering #4 – Green and Black Tea Leaves







          As with our coffee, our Tea Leaves
come from best organic plantations in China and Sri Lanka with only the highest
handpicked quality selection making its way into our customer's cups. We offer
real Green and Black (Red) Tea without dust and coloring. Pu-erh, Oolong, Longjing
and also rich choice of flower teas from all over the world. Only the best authentic Tea, something that these days is more
and more rare!
Additionally we are happy to offer you different Natural Flower Teas, which are also wonderful.


Who am I and what is FARBO Café?
                                                 


My name is Taras, and ever since I can remember, I've been
fascinated with cooking. As a toddler I pulled pots and pans out of the
cupboard and pretended to cook. By the age of 8, I was already pestering my
mother in the kitchen, peering between her oven mitts. Once I even tried to
grab a hot tray! Under her watchful eye, I began to cook. First following her
instructions carefully, and then experimenting on my own.
          While other kids
played war games and pretended to kill each other, I wanted nothing more than
to bake and cook. I soon began to experiment with my own creations. These early
experiments in cuisine enjoyed varying degrees of success.  Some were popular with my family, while in
fairness, others became more notorious than anything else.
          After high school, I went to culinary college and finished my full 3-year studies within 2 years with distinction. I became a trained Chef and continued my experiments on a new level as a professional.
          An area of interest
and recurring theme that arose during my evolution as a chef, are what I call
“resurrected recipes”. I love to find old recipes that have fallen out of favor,
and make them au courant. They say that everything comes around again. As with
fashion, some rediscovered recipes should really be left right where they are
found, banned to the annals of “bad idea to begin with”. However, occasionally,
even stunningly, others are real gems have somehow been mysteriously lost through
no fault of their own. In the case of my more successful dishes of this sort,
only Father Time knows why they were lost through the generations.
          Finding a hidden
gem like this has become my passion. Every chef has some “go-to” favorites that
they know they can rely on to elicit the magic the requisite moment requires,
and these quality offerings through FARBO Café, are mine.


          One of the other guiding stars I've realized
through years of experimentation and experience is that food must be made from
natural products. It is critical to prepare everything with only the best
and most natural products available. In all areas of gastronomy, the whole
really can be greater than the sum-of-the parts IF you begin with the very finest ingredients and apply some magic
and craft but if you don't start correctly with the best ingredients, no spell
or trick you can conjure in the kitchen will change the reality of “garbage in,
garbage out”.
          As such, I strive to create food that is
perfectly balanced and healthy, in addition to being delicious. Even good baked
items, if made with an eye for balance, can be part of a balanced diet that
won’t pile on the pounds AND delicious. Unfortunately we now live in an
industrialized and myopic food culture from GMO to the ridiculous amounts of
preservatives we ingest each year, where cheap tricks reign -such as simply
piling on the sugar in the form of cheap but unhealthy corn syrup, for example,
or ridiculous amounts of sodium and other preservatives while skimping on the
more satisfying and delicious natural sugars and tastes available only in
fruits and other quality natural ingredients.


          What gives my passion for cuisine true meaning,
is sharing it with other people. Only then does it take on ultimate value for
me. I want to create my own café to share the results of my long research and
bring new ideas and great tastes to people around me.
          My direct experience has taught me the
importance of a focus on quality for not only food, but every aspect of life.
New experiences are like splashes of color in an otherwise faded world. New
experiences bring color to our life. That why I am creating FARBO Café.


                                    FARBO Café -                                         A place where your experiences
brings new                                           colors to life!







         What I Need & What You Get

          To create FARBO Café I need 68.000
euro. I’m working hard to develop my own funds for this project, but it will
take me many years if I do it on my own. I believe that with your help I can
reach my goal faster and without any question do much more good in the world
than simply getting a loan from the bank. In addition to bringing my delicious
and healthy products to the world, I will be able to help educate and feed
people who really need it rather than feeding other greedy and mythical “animals”
like Angels, Dragons and fat-cat bankers!
          Here on Indiegogo, as well as on
Facebook, Twitter and YouTube my supporters will get up-to-date pictures, a
newsletter, and updates regarding FARBO Café projects, so you
can see first-hand how your contribution is making a difference!

Unsere Top-Qualitätsangebote:

          Im Farbo Café bieten wir unseren Gästen viele qualitativ hochwertigen Erzeugnisse. Hier ein kleiner Auszug aus unserer Produktpalette:


FARBO 
Quality Offering #1 - Eiscreme






            Natürliches handgemachtes Eis schonend hergestellt nach einem großartigen Originalrezept. Wenn Ihr denkt Eis zu kennen dann habt Ihr unseres noch nicht probiert! Viele die in den Genuss gekommen sind es zu kosten, sagten es war „ein neues Geschmackserlebnis“, „als hätten sie zum ersten Mal Eis gegessen“… Das liegt vor allem an der Basis, den Ingredienzien, unserer köstlichen aromatischen Eiscreme. Sie wird ausschließlich aus natürlichen Zutaten hergestellt, enthält keine Stabilisatoren, chemischen Aroma- oder Farbstoffe. Verfeinert mit knackigen Nüssen und frischen Früchten ist unser Eis ein absolut unvergessliches Erlebnis. Unsere Gäste schwärmen vor allem von zwei Geschmacksrichtungen “Salty Sailor” und “Cheese Please”.

FARBOQuality Offering #2 – Backwaren ""Mini- Täschchen""


          Meine berühmten ""Kirschtäschchen"" entstammen der traditionellen finnischen Küche. Während einer Finnlandreise habe ich diverse finnische Kirsch-Backwaren probiert. Ich fand sie gut, doch etwas fehlte. Da kulinarisches Tüfteln zu meinem Naturell gehört überlegte ich mir gleich wie man den Geschmack intensivieren und abrunden könnte. Nach einer langen Versuchsreihe kreierte ich aus den traditionellen finnischen Kirsch-Backwaren etwas Neues: meine berühmten „Kirschtäschchen“, die u.A. mit Kirschsaft statt Wasser zubereitet werden. Einmal die richtige Geschmacksbalance gefunden, begannen die Leute sie zu lieben.




FARBOQuality Offering #3 – Kaffeespezialitäten–Bohnen






          FARBO Kaffee (Third Wave) wird aus Bohnen gewonnen, die aus biologischem Anbau stammen und liebevoll von Hand geerntet werden. Die Bohnen werden unter Fair Trade-Bedingungen angebaut, geerntet und verarbeitet. Ergebnis der Fair Trade- geprüften Produktion sind beste Kaffeebohnen von Röstern die ausschließlich Qualitätsware verwenden.



FARBO
Quality Offering #4 – Grüne und schwarze Teeblätter







          Wie unser Kaffee stammen auch die Teeblätter
von Bio-Plantagen in China und Sri Lanka. Die Blätter werden ausschließlich handverlesen. Am Ende sind es nur die qualitativ hochwertigsten Blätter, die ihren Weg in die Tassen unserer Kunden finden. Wir bieten echte Grün- und Schwarztees, ohne Staub oder Farbstoffe, an. Aber auch Pu-Erh, Oolong, Longjing und viele weitere Sorten stehen in unseren Regalen. Nur die besten und authentischsten Tees, schaffen es in unser Sortiment. Und das ist heutzutage keine Selbstverständlichkeit!

Darüber hinaus freuen wir uns, Ihnen verschiedene natürlich Blumen-Tees, die auch wunderbar sind.


Wer bin ich und was ist FARBO Café?
                                                 


Mein Name ist Taras. Seit ich denken kann übt Kochen eine besondere Faszination auf mich aus.
Als Kleinkind zog ich Töpfe und Pfannen aus dem Schrank und habe so getan als ob ich kochen würde. Im Alter von 8, nervte ich meine Mutter in der Küche und spielte mit allen möglichen Küchenutensilien. Einmal habe ich sogar versucht ein heißes Backbleck anzufassen! Unter ihren wachsamen Augen fing ich langsam an zu kochen. Zuerst befolgte ich genau ihre Anweisungen, doch im Laufe der Zeit begann ich selbst zu experimentieren.
          Während andere Kinder Kriegsspiele spielten und vorgaben sich gegenseitig zu töten, wollte ich nichts weiter als backen und kochen. Bald wagte ich mich an eigene Kreationen heran. Diese frühen kulinarischen Versuchsreihen waren von unterschiedlichen Erfolgen gekrönt. Einige kamen nur sehr gut bei meiner Familie an, während andere auch außerhalb der eigenen vier Wände berühmt- berüchtigt wurden.
          Nach meinem Schulabschluss besuchte ich eine 3- jährige kulinarische Hochschule und schloss diese bereits nach 2 Jahren ab. Danach konnte ich, als offiziell anerkannter Profi, meine experimentellen Versuche auf einem wesentlich höheren Niveau fortsetzten.
          Ein Thema, das immer wieder eine Rolle in meinem Arbeitsleben spielt und während meiner Entwicklung zum Profi dominant wurde, ist jenes das ich „wiederbelebte Rezepte“ nenne. Ich liebe es, alte Rezepte, die in Ungnade gefallen sind auszugraben, und sie zu revitalisieren. Man sagt, dass alles irgendwann wiederkommt. Wie bei der Mode, sollten einige wiederentdeckte Rezepte wirklich genau dort bleiben wo sie hergekommen sind: in der Versenkung. Doch gelegentlich lassen sich unter ihnen echte kulinarische Juwelen entdecken, die lange verloren zu sein schienen, und die, nachdem sie durch meine liebevollen Hände gingen, in neuem Glanz erstrahlten.
          Die Suche nach solch verschollenen Schätzen hat meine Leidenschaft geweckt. Jeder Koch hat seine ganz persönlichen Favoriten, bei welchen er sich darauf verlassen kann, dass sie dem Genussmoment eine einzigartige magische Wirkung verleihen. Auch ich darf solch wundervolle Erzeugnisse mein Eigen nennen und möchte diese nun in Form meines ganz persönlichen Sortiments im FARBO Café anbieten.


          Ich bin im Laufe der Jahre und nach etlichen Experimenten zur Erkenntnis gelangt, dass Lebensmittel ausschließlich aus Naturprodukten hergestellt werden sollten.
In diesem Zusammenhang ist eine sorgfältige Auswahl der hochwertigsten Naturprodukte von essentieller Bedeutung. In allen Bereichen der Gastronomie ist das große Ganze bedeutender als die Summe aller Teile, sofern man mit den besten Zutaten beginnt und etwas Magie sowie handwerkliches Geschick hinzufügt. Doch wenn am Anfang minderwertige Zutaten stehen, so kann auch die beste „Zauberformel“ zu keinem guten Ergebnis mehr führen. Ganz nach dem Motto: „garbage in, garbage out“.
          Unter diesem Aspekt strebe ich danach Produkte zu kreieren, die ausgewogen, gesund und darüber hinaus köstlich sind. Selbst Backwaren können, wenn man auf die richtige Balance der Zutaten achtet, Teil einer ausgewogenen, gesunden Ernährung sein und noch dazu hervorragend schmecken. Leider leben wir momentan in einer Welt, die von einer industrialisierten und kurzsichtigen Esskultur dominiert wird. Voller gentechnisch veränderter Lebensmittel, ganz zu schweigen von den Unmengen an Konservierungsstoffen, die wir Jahr für Jahr zu uns nehmen. Eine Welt in der billige Tricks regieren – wie zum Beispiel die Verwendung von minderwertigem Zucker in Form von billigem und ungesundem Maissirup, oder unnötig hohen Mengen an Natrium und anderen Konservierungsstoffen, während mit dem wesentlich gesünderen Fruchtzucker und anderen hochwertigen natürlichen Inhaltsstoffen viel zu sparsam umgegangen wird.


          Was meiner Leidenschaft für die Küche wahre Bedeutung verleiht ist es diese mit anderen Menschen zu teilen. Erst dann stellt sie auch einen Wert für mich dar. Ich möchte mein eigenes Café eröffnen, um die Ergebnisse meiner lang andauernden Forschung unters Volk zu bringen, innovative Kreationen zu liefern und den Menschen neue Geschmackserlebnisse zu bieten.
          Meine unmittelbare Erfahrung hat mir gezeigt, dass der Fokus auf Qualität, nicht nur in Bezug auf Lebensmittel, sondern auch für jeden Aspekt im Leben, von enormer Bedeutung ist. Neue Erfahrungen sind die Farbtupfer in einer sonst so fahlen Welt. Sie bringen Farbe in unser Leben. Der Grund, warum ich FARBO Café ins Leben rufen möchte.


                                    FARBO Café - 

               ein Ort wo neue Erfahrungen Farbe 

                               ins Leben bringen!






    Was ich brauche & was Ihr erhaltet

          Um das FARBO Café gründen zu können benötige ich € 68.000. Ich arbeite hart, um eigene finanzielle Mittel für dieses Projekt aufzubringen, doch es würde mich etliche Jahre kosten, um es aus eigener Kraft zu schaffen. Ich bin sicher, dass ich mit Eurer Hilfe mein Ziel schneller erreichen kann und zweifelsohne mehr in der Welt bewirken kann als einfach nur einen Kredit bei der Bank aufzunehmen. Abgesehen von den köstlichen und gesunden Produkten, die ich in die Welt hinaustrage, werde ich in der Lage sein Menschen zu helfen, sie auszubilden und ausgewogene Nahrungsmittel an den Mann/die Frau zu bringen, anstatt irgendwelche Kredithaie mit horrenden Zinsen zu füttern.
          Hier auf Indiegogo, sowie Facebook, Twitter and YouTube werden alle die mich unterstützen mit up-to-date- Bildern, einem Newsletter und sämtlichen Neuigkeiten rund ums FARBO Café Projekt versorgt. So erfahrt Ihr aus erster Hand welch große Wirkung Euer Beitrag erzielt!

<p>My name is Ruben Morgado and I am a Mozambican architect living in the United States. I don’t know anyone that loves his country like my father, Carlos Morgado, did.  After he passed away, my brothers and I made a promise to keep his name and legacy alive - for that reason we created the <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/carlosmorgadofoundation"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Carlos Morgado Foundation</a>.</p>
<p>Mangundze is a village in the south of Mozambique with a severe lack of basic infrastructure like water, electricity and sanitation.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1432696954/cormffq00qcnvgeuycaq.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p></p><h4><i style=""font-weight: normal;"">Why Mangundze?</i></h4><p></p>
<p>Mangundze is a community with many pressing needs, but with a little bit of funding, we've identified a way to immediately and easily address some of those needs.  <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/juan.g.arias.129"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"" target=""_blank"">Juan Gabriel Arias</a>, an Argentinian priest that is a close friend of Pope Francis, has a crazy passion for soccer (we do too!) and settled locally to become the caretaker of the old and charming church of Mangundze, is dedicated to assisting the community in any way that he can.  We immediately recognized in him the same commitment and determination to help our country.  Together, we have already worked towards a better Mozambique by implementing projects to rehabilitate schools and a health center to improve the lives and health of vulnerable Mozambicans.</p>
<p>The most critical problem in Mangundze is lack of access to drinking water from improved water sources.  The Carlos Morgado Foundation is determined to work with the regional government and other local organizations to build more boreholes and/or wells closer to the population;  however, this will take time, and requires a larger investment.  While these efforts are being planned, the lack of water continues to affect the daily lives and health of the population.</p>
<p>For this reason we are committed, with your help, to buying and transporting 50 Hippo Water Rollers (<a href=""http://www.hipporoller.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.hipporoller.org</a>) from South Africa to Juan Gabriel for distribution to the population.  A Hippo Water Roller is a high capacity plastic drum that can be rolled when filled, instead of the traditional jugs that require carrying, often on the head.  The plan is that 1 hippo roller will be shared by 5 families, resulting in a life-changing impact to 250 families, or approximately 1,250 people.</p>
<h3>The Budget</h3>
<p>Imbuvu Projects in South Africa, the company that sells the Hippo Water Roller, has quoted us with a cost for 50 units to be delivered to the closest postal office to Mangundze in the city of Xai-xai. If we are unable to reach our fundraising goal to buy 50 units, we will still buy and distribute any units possible with the funds raised.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1432695221/s5fqpdgbuxsvfcaxidni.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h3>The Problem</h3>
<p>Only a very small percentage of the population in Mangundze has direct access to an improved water source - drinking water here is a luxury.  The lack of access to water is responsible for serious health problems in the population and is the main direct cause of the high infant mortality in the region.  Consumption from unimproved water sources most commonly leads to diarrhea, and consequently dehydration, exacerbating the effects of chronic malnutrition in the region.  In addition to these obvious health concerns, the community’s social, educational and economic development is stifled as a result.</p>
<h4><i style=""font-weight: normal;"">Access to Water Sources</i></h4>
<p>For the World Health Organization (WHO), an improved drinking water source is defined as one that, by nature of its construction or through active intervention, is likely to be protected from outside contamination, in particular from contamination with fecal matter.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1432696386/evoeqzbqoc5kj27eg0ec.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p></p><h4><i style=""font-weight: normal;"">Consumption of Water</i></h4><p></p>
<p>The average water consumption in developed countries varies between 200 and 300 liters (52 and 79 gallons) per person, per day.  According to the WHO, the minimal water consumption for drinking and cooking is set at 15 liters (3.9 gallons) per person, per day.  In rural Mozambique, this is estimated at approximately 4 liters (1 gallon).  With just this one glaring statistic, the extent of the problem becomes clearer.  Due to lack of access, residents of Magundze consume only one quarter of the minimal amount of water deemed necessary for a healthy life.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1432696404/e7qypqy2p9qqvz3mlvfg.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h4><i style=""font-weight: normal;"">Women and Children</i></h4>
<p>In Magundze, women and children travel long distances every day to collect water for their families, carrying the water on top of their heads.  Most of these children skip school to help with this important task, yet the quantity of water that can be collected in one day is still insufficient.  The physical stress of carrying the large weight of water on their heads is immense, often causing spinal injuries and other back problems.  Furthermore, temperatures can easily reach 35 degrees Celsius (95F) and higher, making the collection of water even more physically taxing.</p>
<h3>The Immediate Solution</h3>
<p>“Designed in Africa for Africa the Hippo Water Roller enables women, children and the elderly to collect 5 times more water than a single bucket by simply rolling it along the ground. The savings in time, energy and reduced suffering are immense and the positive social-impact benefits are far reaching.""</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1432696563/jaao2mvcmbjdlgmcmy7j.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p></p>
<p>The Hippo Water Roller is a plastic drum with
90 liters of capacity.  With Hippo Rollers, the population can collect drinking water and easily roll it back to their homes. The use of this solution has the following immediate benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>Makes the collection of drinking
     water faster</li>
<li>Reduces the physical strain of
     carrying the water</li>
<li>Relieves women and children to have
     more time for education, livelihood and social activities</li>
</ul>
<p>The use of Hippo Rollers does not replace the need for new water sources, but with a lifespan of 5-7 years, it will alleviate this stress in the community while efforts are made to open up new water access points.</p><h3><i>Thank you for your help!</i></h3></div>","Summary

The lack of access to water is responsible for serious health problems in the population and is the main direct cause of the high infant mortality in the region.  Consumption from unimproved water sources most commonly leads to diarrhea, and consequently dehydration, exacerbating the effects of chronic malnutrition in the region.  In addition to these obvious health concerns, the community’s social, educational and economic development is stifled as a result.
Access to Water Sources
For the World Health Organization (WHO), an improved drinking water source is defined as one that, by nature of its construction or through active intervention, is likely to be protected from outside contamination, in particular from contamination with fecal matter.

Consumption of Water
The average water consumption in developed countries varies between 200 and 300 liters (52 and 79 gallons) per person, per day.  According to the WHO, the minimal water consumption for drinking and cooking is set at 15 liters (3.9 gallons) per person, per day.  In rural Mozambique, this is estimated at approximately 4 liters (1 gallon).  With just this one glaring statistic, the extent of the problem becomes clearer.  Due to lack of access, residents of Magundze consume only one quarter of the minimal amount of water deemed necessary for a healthy life.

Women and Children
In Magundze, women and children travel long distances every day to collect water for their families, carrying the water on top of their heads.  Most of these children skip school to help with this important task, yet the quantity of water that can be collected in one day is still insufficient.  The physical stress of carrying the large weight of water on their heads is immense, often causing spinal injuries and other back problems.  Furthermore, temperatures can easily reach 35 degrees Celsius (95F) and higher, making the collection of water even more physically taxing.
The Immediate Solution
“Designed in Africa for Africa the Hippo Water Roller enables women, children and the elderly to collect 5 times more water than a single bucket by simply rolling it along the ground. The savings in time, energy and reduced suffering are immense and the positive social-impact benefits are far reaching.""
The Hippo Water Roller is a plastic drum with
90 liters of capacity.  With Hippo Rollers, the population can collect drinking water and easily roll it back to their homes. The use of this solution has the following immediate benefits:

Makes the collection of drinking
     water faster
Reduces the physical strain of
     carrying the water
Relieves women and children to have
     more time for education, livelihood and social activities

The use of Hippo Rollers does not replace the need for new water sources, but with a lifespan of 5-7 years, it will alleviate this stress in the community while efforts are made to open up new water access points.Thank you for your help!",5.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<p><b>Holistic Dreamz, Soldier’s Success Story</b></p>
<p>Take your place in the line of people standing together. Secure the future for thousands of soldiers and their families. Instantly guarantee hope for their health and happiness.</p>
<p><b>The road to recovery</b></p>
<p>A powerful show of support is what military and veterans need right now.</p>
<p>Enterprising soldier Gemma Gardner fought her way back from a mental breakdown. She took the road to recovery.</p>
<p>She now owns a successful health and wellbeing venture. She is mapping out the route for others to follow.</p>
<p>33-year-old Gemma from Salford UK, served 14 years in the army.</p>
<p>She was left devastated in 2014 when she was medically discharged with compartment syndrome, causing her legs to become very swollen.</p>
<p>Cut off from army life, loss of identification from all she had known since the age of 17, Gemma suffered a mental breakdown and became totally reliant on her husband Gareth.</p>
<p>But her hope for the future started to improve when she discovered healing therapies that worked alongside medical advice. Through determination and support the mother-of-three went on to launch Holistic Dreamz, which connects the public to a range of alternative healing services. Now Gemma is expanding the business to focus on military personnel and their families. She needs your help to promote her 90 day programme of support.</p>
<p>Gemma is a living testament to the success of taking ownership when transitioning from military to civilian life.</p>
<p><b>Help thousands of military personnel worldwide</b></p>
<p>This campaign will reach out to 2,437,000 European, 59,000 Canadian, 51,000 Australian, 9,000 New Zealand, 1,370,000 US military personnel.</p>
<p>A unique 90 day programme (with 100% success rate) can provide structure, remove personal barriers and give life focus. The 90 day programme provides continual support to those who are feeling overwhelmed by life outside the parameters of the armed forces. Struggling in silence can become a thing of the past.</p>
<p><b>What the programme does</b></p>
<p>If someone can’t swim, they need help to stay afloat until they can swim. If someone has health problems, they need help to find answers until good health returns.</p>
<p>The programme will give ironclad information and support to serving and veteran military personnel in Europe, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and the USA.</p>
<p><b>Your donation will save family lives</b></p>
<p>There are currently over 20 million veterans living in the United States and nearly ten percent are receiving care for mental illness <sup>[1]</sup> Although Governments give high priority to the care of injured troops, including mental health support, often more support is needed too. As Gemma knows, the feelings of isolation and despair can be overwhelming.

</div></div>","What is Dom’s Chop Salsa?Dom’s Chop
Salsa (DCS) is the real deal; made in a way that’s different from other salsa
you might see on the shelf.  The secret
is that we grill our ingredients – instead of oven roasting them. 
Why is
grilled better?  The process
results in a natural smoky flavor that is infused into all of our salsa
fixin’s.  The heat, temperature and mesquite chips in the charcoal creates this flavor goodness right over
the open grill.  No fake flakes here!Our secret
seasoning combines authentic Tex-Mex flavor and the homestyle BBQ taste you
love.  Traditional + BBQ = a special
flavor fusion known as DCS.The Story:Started by Dom and Susie Mendiola in
August 2014, the DCS concept came from a desire to share a unique homemade salsa
with friends and family. What began with a couple of grills, blenders,
and fry carts expanded as demand increased - which led to the decision to scale production, fill online orders and enter the local market.Why do we need to fund DCS?Our goal is to raise $50,000 ... and keep your mouths happy with that smoky grilled taste!
Hitting this gets us:1. A custom made stainless steel grill ... the DCS 5000,
designed just for us:To keep making salsa and take DCS to market with our true grilled taste – this is a must! Designed by our partner Ernest Flores,  this will allow us to automate and scale production 1000 percent.  Today we can make 25 jars per hour and we can't keep up with demand ... the DCS 5000 will bring us to 275 jars per hour! The DCS 5000 will cost $25k to have created through a custom
grill fabricator and is essential to keep DCS going. 
2. First official release of Dom’s Chop Salsa:We are ready to release three official DCS flavors:

Traditional Mild


Happy Medium


Scorpion Hot 

A minimum of 1100 jars per flavor is required, which
means the first official DCS release will be a minimum total of 3300 jars. Our hope is that
this campaign will blow that number out of the water! Shh – don’t tell our
co-packer yet.

3. What we need to make it all work:
From labels to advertising to getting Dom some voice lessons
(he sings to the tomatoes) ... we're gonna do it right. It also includes some of the fun stuff we’ve
got in the pipeline for this campaign – stickers, t-shirts, engraved grill plates, grill kits, launch party support &
more.
How else to get
involved:

the word out to your friends. Facebook, Tweet, email Gammy in Ohio - whatever you
can do to help us spread the word!


Continue to believe in us. The support we've had
from family, friends & the community is what has taken DCS this far and
inspires us to push even further.  


TL;DR: We have the best grilled salsa in South TX and need your
help sharing it with the rest of the world.

<p>It is a big dream and I know that the funds I am looking for are not small and the work that needs to be done is tremendous but I have seen how people together can do incredible things! <br/></p>
<p>A lot of my motivation comes from a simple observation that a lot of men and women, and especially women, struggle to like and feel good about themselves - What to wear?  What to eat?  Am I too fat?  Is my make-up looking o.k?  Am I beautiful enough?  Hours and hours are spent in front of the mirror and are we ever fully happy with what we see?  The reflection in the mirror has taken over the real person.  We need to look more carefully to see clearly, we need to look within. <br/></p>

<p><b></b></p>
<p>I
grew up in a small town in Latvia.  There was a time when I believed I would never board a
plane, it was something only privileged people got to do.  We got to visit the airport with my class teacher to see the air planes.  Through a child's eyes they were amazing and I dreamed of taking flight one day.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1437345114/nf1ijueqpbhvi0dyii5q.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p></p>At
the age of 19 I boarded my first flight to Ireland.  Times had changed fast and<b> </b>flying had become affordable.  English was the language I always wanted to learn. Cork, a beautiful and charming city, became<b> </b>my home<b>.</b><br/><p>I
grew fond of Irish people immediately, I found them kind, friendly, very helpful,
and full of cheer. <br/>
</p>
<b></b><p>I
started working in bars and retail shops.  Soon enough I found myself itching to
become master of some trade<b>.</b>  At<b> </b>age 21 I embarked on my first nail course. Breaking into the beauty industry
was harder than I imagined, but the joy of making people happy and being able to listen to so many life stories kept me
going.

</p>
<b></b><p>Eight
years went by, I did a lot of growing up, explored the world, and worked for
different salons.  I started to dream of my own salon, I had a clear, vivid vision
of how it would look and feel, and how it could change the concept of a beauty salon.</p>

<h3><b>The Vision</b></h3>
<p></p>
<p>Creating Beauty Crime on a
     bigger scale would be an amazing opportunity to provide everyone living and visiting Cork with wonderful and unforgettable experiences; a place where you can renew your energy and enjoy your time, a place where the true meaning of
     beauty can be revived, cherished and shared!  If this beautiful vision comes true who knows...  one day we might spread our wings to
     reach you overseas!</p>
</div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get  <br/>
</h3>To buy the building €950,000 is needed.  I went inside the building three weeks ago, to 
take some pictures, and I got the floor plans.  I showed it all to my 
brother to see if it would be architecturally possible.  My brother Ervin 
has been passionate about building since childhood, he builds houses 
from the foundation upwards, and completed the renovation at Beauty 
Crime premises as well as custom made all the wooden furniture. I call 
him the  man with ""golden hands"" and have always admired his skill, 
creativity and precision.  We estimate that the renovations, refurbishing and opening to the public will cost us € 1.500 000. <br/><br/>If  we don't manage to get enough funding to buy and renovate the 
beautiful white building on Grand Parade, we can explore other possibilities of how to invest the funds to expand and make some of these wonderful things come true.  All our supporters that purchased Treatment Vouchers are welcome to book and enjoy their treatments at our current beauty salon: Beauty Crime on 10 Cornmarket Street, Cork, Ireland .
 <br/>Everyone who contributed by purchasing products from our ELIER Organic Skin Care Perks will receive their package soon after the funds are transferred with a little thank you token!<br/><br/><h3>This is how you can support us! </h3>

<p></p>I chose a relatively new brand of natural cosmetics for the
treatments we offer at Beauty Crime and as you might have never heard about ELIER before, I will give you some insights.<br/><p>The company and the products are based on Organic Mud that has been used in skin regeneration for more than 200 years.<br/></p>
<p>I started to use Elier 3 years ago when I decided to spend a summer at my parents’ house after coming home from 6 months of traveling in India. 
My Mom had become a true admirer of the brand which meant that wherever I
turned there was a bottle of Elier.  What I loved immediately were the scents and
feel of all the products – light, smooth, natural, truly elegant.  Twice a week
we covered ourselves in Elier Organic Mud and enjoyed the pleasant heat of traditional Latvian sauna, which increases the effect of the mud.  After this process I felt like a new born baby,
clean and pure inside out.  Two months later I was in love with Elier and in many ways this new found love added inspiration for me to open a beauty place that
embraces health, a place where the least possible amount of chemicals are used.</p>
<p>Elier has a beautiful history.  The Organic Mud has been used
in skin regeneration treatments for more than 200 years.  The known history dates back to the time of the Russian Empire when Catherine the Great discovered Elier Mud in a
small village in the land where Latvia now is.  In 1785 Catherine the Great
opened a clinic for the people, before that it was used only by the royal family.
The clinic remained open until World War II.  Later the natural reserve of
Elier Organic Mud was bought by a private investor.</p>
<p>At the time there was no scientific research done, and there
was no clarity on why the mud was so effective in skin regeneration.  The
research was started in 1999 by an international team of scientists in
Switzerland, the results were incredible - the underground caves that were
filled with Elier Mud over millions of years were formed from broken down flora
and fauna soaking through the ground.  The mud reservoir is like a living organism
capable of reproducing.  The composition of Elier Organic Mud has <strong>more than 800 biologically active substances</strong> that are
all present in human skin cells which means that our skin can easily recognize and absorb them.</p>
<p><b> </b></p>

<p>ELIER product formulas were developed in collaboration with
scientific laboratories. The Swiss ELIER Laboratory developed a 5-stage patented extraction technology that made it possible to extract highly organic substances and create a unique skin and
health care product range that could mark the end to your search for the perfect

Hello Dear Citizens of the World!  I am very excited to share my dreams, ideas and passion with you!  Thank you for watching my video! 
My name is Ilze.  I am very passionate about beauty and I feel privileged to have met some of the most
beautiful people in my life. They were kind, caring, they shared their stories,
their happiness and smiles, they were open-hearted and they made me feel special. 
Today I
feel experienced enough, wise enough, and determined enough to create a place where
people can gather together to indulge in beauty and feel special. 

This beautiful building is a true landmark of Cork City. It has been empty for a long time.

A few weeks ago it came on the market, the starting price is € 950,000 and it needs a lot of renovation and complete refurbishment. I have walked past it so many times envisioning the amazing place it could become.  The
official use at the moment is listed as offices, but it could be changed. This building
could become a true embodiment of beauty and health.  A place where people can come to regain their energy, clear
their mind, socialize productively, and get inspired. Just imagine...

Unique Spa where you
can enjoy a Manicure, Pedicure, Facial, Full Body Mud Treatment, Sauna and Relaxing Massage



Organic Food Restaurant where you can treat yourself to the most Delicious
and Nutritious Food presented in creative recipes

Organic
Cosmetic Shop where you can get skincare you can trust 

Beauty
Training School where newly qualified specialists can gain real experience
through unique training programs designed by experienced professionals


Function
Room where you can enjoy your drink in the company of great people with wonderful
live music performances


40
Seat Home-Style Cinema for watching documentaries, speeches and inspiring movies
designed for the ultimate feel of comfort


Lecture Room where courses on self-development, lifestyle, beauty and nutrition
would be held



Solo
Escape Meditation Rooms were you can hide away from the world for a while and reconnect with yourself.  There would be a Silent Room, Mantra
Room, and a Symphonic Music Room featuring color and imagery therapy 


Men’s
Grooming Wing for men who like to take good care of themselves. There is nothing as charming as a well-groomed and well-mannered man


Guest Bedrooms for a very special stay in Cork City




Kids
Drop off Point, happy days! Just imagine leaving your children in safe hands while you
pamper yourself or catch an inspiring lecture.


It is a big dream and I know that the funds I am looking for are not small and the work that needs to be done is tremendous but I have seen how people together can do incredible things! 
A lot of my motivation comes from a simple observation that a lot of men and women, and especially women, struggle to like and feel good about themselves - What to wear?  What to eat?  Am I too fat?  Is my make-up looking o.k?  Am I beautiful enough?  Hours and hours are spent in front of the mirror and are we ever fully happy with what we see?  The reflection in the mirror has taken over the real person.  We need to look more carefully to see clearly, we need to look within. 

Beauty starts with
     taking good care of yourself - your intellect , your body and your feelings.  It is a way to develop a contented character, a healthy body and a  heart that is filled with hope, love and happiness.  It can be hard work to get there but it is worth it!  It leads to meaningful relationships, a satisfying life and lasting happiness. A bit of my story 

I
grew up in a small town in Latvia.  There was a time when I believed I would never board a
plane, it was something only privileged people got to do.  We got to visit the airport with my class teacher to see the air planes.  Through a child's eyes they were amazing and I dreamed of taking flight one day.


At
the age of 19 I boarded my first flight to Ireland.  Times had changed fast and flying had become affordable.  English was the language I always wanted to learn. Cork, a beautiful and charming city, became my home.I
grew fond of Irish people immediately, I found them kind, friendly, very helpful,
and full of cheer. 

I
started working in bars and retail shops.  Soon enough I found myself itching to
become master of some trade.  At age 21 I embarked on my first nail course. Breaking into the beauty industry
was harder than I imagined, but the joy of making people happy and being able to listen to so many life stories kept me
going.


Eight
years went by, I did a lot of growing up, explored the world, and worked for
different salons.  I started to dream of my own salon, I had a clear, vivid vision
of how it would look and feel, and how it could change the concept of a beauty salon.

When
I found the Beauty Crime premises, at first my friends thought I was a mad woman and I
guess they had a good reason!
This is what we were facing..

Together
we embarked on the mission to make the impossible possible. It was three months of super hard work, a lot of worry but a lot of laughter too.There
was very little sleep and a lot of coffee with chocolate croissants. The abundant
support of my friends and family was invaluable. 
Today when I see people
enjoying themselves at Beauty Crime I think to myself – it was all worth it.

I wanted our clients to experience beauty with all of their senses. I wanted them to feel comfortable, to see beautiful surroundings, to inhale the mild calming scent of fresh flowers and incense with every breath.  I wanted them to forget about their daily worries, just sip away on delicious coffee, flip through inspiring books and truly indulge themselves in serenity while our friendly team of professionals are taking good care of them.  After a few  months I saw that Beauty Crime was becoming a very special place.

The Vision

Creating Beauty Crime on a
     bigger scale would be an amazing opportunity to provide everyone living and visiting Cork with wonderful and unforgettable experiences; a place where you can renew your energy and enjoy your time, a place where the true meaning of
     beauty can be revived, cherished and shared!  If this beautiful vision comes true who knows...  one day we might spread our wings to
     reach you overseas!
  What We Need & What You Get  
To buy the building €950,000 is needed.  I went inside the building three weeks ago, to 
take some pictures, and I got the floor plans.  I showed it all to my 
brother to see if it would be architecturally possible.  My brother Ervin 
has been passionate about building since childhood, he builds houses 
from the foundation upwards, and completed the renovation at Beauty 
Crime premises as well as custom made all the wooden furniture. I call 
him the  man with ""golden hands"" and have always admired his skill, 
creativity and precision.  We estimate that the renovations, refurbishing and opening to the public will cost us € 1.500 000. If  we don't manage to get enough funding to buy and renovate the 
beautiful white building on Grand Parade, we can explore other possibilities of how to invest the funds to expand and make some of these wonderful things come true.  All our supporters that purchased Treatment Vouchers are welcome to book and enjoy their treatments at our current beauty salon: Beauty Crime on 10 Cornmarket Street, Cork, Ireland .
 Everyone who contributed by purchasing products from our ELIER Organic Skin Care Perks will receive their package soon after the funds are transferred with a little thank you token!This is how you can support us!

 Natural Skin Care PERKS 

ELIER - Highly Organic Mud Cosmetics




I chose a relatively new brand of natural cosmetics for the
treatments we offer at Beauty Crime and as you might have never heard about ELIER before, I will give you some insights.The company and the products are based on Organic Mud that has been used in skin regeneration for more than 200 years.
I started to use Elier 3 years ago when I decided to spend a summer at my parents’ house after coming home from 6 months of traveling in India. 
My Mom had become a true admirer of the brand which meant that wherever I
turned there was a bottle of Elier.  What I loved immediately were the scents and
feel of all the products – light, smooth, natural, truly elegant.  Twice a week
we covered ourselves in Elier Organic Mud and enjoyed the pleasant heat of traditional Latvian sauna, which increases the effect of the mud.  After this process I felt like a new born baby,
clean and pure inside out.  Two months later I was in love with Elier and in many ways this new found love added inspiration for me to open a beauty place that
embraces health, a place where the least possible amount of chemicals are used.
Elier has a beautiful history.  The Organic Mud has been used
in skin regeneration treatments for more than 200 years.  The known history dates back to the time of the Russian Empire when Catherine the Great discovered Elier Mud in a
small village in the land where Latvia now is.  In 1785 Catherine the Great
opened a clinic for the people, before that it was used only by the royal family.
The clinic remained open until World War II.  Later the natural reserve of
Elier Organic Mud was bought by a private investor.
At the time there was no scientific research done, and there
was no clarity on why the mud was so effective in skin regeneration.  The
research was started in 1999 by an international team of scientists in
Switzerland, the results were incredible - the underground caves that were
filled with Elier Mud over millions of years were formed from broken down flora
and fauna soaking through the ground.  The mud reservoir is like a living organism
capable of reproducing.  The composition of Elier Organic Mud has more than 800 biologically active substances that are
all present in human skin cells which means that our skin can easily recognize and absorb them.
 
ELIER

ELIER product formulas were developed in collaboration with
scientific laboratories. The Swiss ELIER Laboratory developed a 5-stage patented extraction technology that made it possible to extract highly organic substances and create a unique skin and
health care product range that could mark the end to your search for the perfect
product! 
Today the 800 organic components extracted from
Elier Organic Mud is recognized as Peloid Complex®.
Elier Peloid Complex® is a high concentration of active substances:
amino acids, vitamins, enzymes, minerals, micro- and macro-elements, natural
anti-oxidants and natural antibiotics. 
Peloid Complex® has a positive influence on blood micro-circulation and the state of the body's capillary system and lymphatic vessels.  It
activates the immune system, stabilizes the functioning of the nervous system and eliminates
toxic and metabolic intermediate products from skin cells, while enhancing their
vitality and process of regeneration.  It also provides a deep antioxidant effect,  and regulates the synthesis of collagen and elastane.

<p>Team Canada has
been selected for IFMA's 2015 Royal World Cup International Tournament on August 13th-23rd, and we want them to bring home gold.</p>
<p>Travelling
internationally is expensive and we want to help lighten the load for our
athletes so they can focus on their training and nutrition. Travel &amp; tournament expenses alone
are <b>$3,500 per athlete</b>. The better we can ease their financial burdens, the
better chance of success each one will have.</p>
<p>Our aim is to
establish Ontario as a predominant source of world class athletes for the sport
of amateur Muay Thai. However, performing at this level presents substantial
challenges outside the ring. Funding, in particular, is the biggest barrier to
high level amateur competition and, in order for our athletes to reach the
world stage, they need your support. Ontario has historically been
underrepresented on Team Canada, and we want that to change. We have a wealth
of Muay Thai talent in our province and this is our time to put Ontario on the
map.</p>
<p>This fundraiser
is for the benefit of four athletes who represent our province on Team Canada: </p>
<p><span>·<span> 
</span></span>Noel
Hussey of West City Muay Thai</p>
<p><span>·<span> 
</span></span>Janice

built out of this success, establishing a legitimacy for the sport and allow
even greater resources to be rallied behind our athletes.</p>
<p>We want to learn

our athletes as they prepare to travel overseas.</p><b>Yes, there are some risks</b><br/><p>As is the case with any sport, there's

establish Ontario as a predominant source of world class athletes for the sport
of amateur Muay Thai. However, performing at this level presents substantial
challenges outside the ring. Funding, in particular, is the biggest barrier to
high level amateur competition and, in order for our athletes to reach the
world stage, they need your support. Ontario has historically been
underrepresented on Team Canada, and we want that to change. We have a wealth
of Muay Thai talent in our province and this is our time to put Ontario on the
map.
This fundraiser
is for the benefit of four athletes who represent our province on Team Canada: 
· 
Noel
Hussey of West City Muay Thai
· 
Janice
Lyn of Krudar Muay Thai
· 
Matt
Mackillop of Siam No. 1
· 
Christine
Doyle of Siam No. 1
The International Federation of Muaythai Amateur is the highest level organization for
amateur Muay Thai and considered the Olympic level of the sport. Each year,
IFMA holds an international tournament with this year's being the Royal World Cup
in Bangkok, Thailand. Athletes that go to IFMA are considered the best in the
amateur circuit, and many champions go on to successful professional careers.

You can help the Ontario athletes with
your donations. Any fundraiser perk that has a physical reward will have a cost
to cover, with any remaining profit being divided evenly among the team. If physical rewards aren't your thing you can donate any amount without selecting a perk and all the funds will go straight to the athletes. Alternatively you can mail a cheque toMuay Thai Ontario
153-155 Limestone Crescent
Toronto ON, M3J 2R1
Our goal is raise $5,200 for the team ($1,300
per athlete) which is only a portion of the travel expenses. If we're extremely successful, any additional funding will still be disbursed to the athletes, up to $14,000; funds donated beyond this amount will be set aside for future athlete travel. Should we not reach our goal any received funds will still be
distributed equally among the athletes.
All donors will be listed permanently on MuayThaiOntario.org.

$16-50: Bronze Donor
$51-99: Silver Donor
$100-199: Gold Donor
$200-500: Provincial Champion Donor
$500-999: National Champion Donor$1000+: World Champion Donor
There are direct
expenses related to the Royal World Cup, totalling $3,500.

· 
$1700
for a round-trip flight to Thailand;
· 
$1,500
for 10-nights of accommodation and food;
· 
$200 in
registration fees; and
· 
$100 in
team uniforms.
The athletes
have to train incredibly hard in preparation for competition, incurring
additional expenses in the form of
· 
Specialized
coaching (Strength, conditioning, sports doctors, exercise therapy);
· 
Proper
nutrition;
· 
Equipment;
and
· 
Training
camps.

Our athletes are
incredible role models and act as ambassadors for our country. With consistent
support they will continue to inspire future generations of Canadians. 
Considering this is
our first fundraiser, we'll be establishing a new means of support and setting
a precedent in Ontario. We aim to be trailblazers in the community when it
comes to finding financial support for our athletes so they can represent our
country on a national or international stage. Future opportunities will be
built out of this success, establishing a legitimacy for the sport and allow
even greater resources to be rallied behind our athletes.
We want to learn
from our experiences, grow as a community and continue to represent Canada with
our provincial athletes. It's important to us that Ontario play an integral
role in the sport of Muay Thai in Canada. You can help us do that by supporting
our athletes as they prepare to travel overseas.Yes, there are some risksAs is the case with any sport, there's
always the risk that an athlete can get injured during the training leading up
to competition. In the event of a withdrawal from the event, the funds will be
evenly distributed among the remaining athletes representing Ontario. Unfortunately Olivia Loth of Krudar has injured her knee and had to withdraw; we wish her a speedy recovery!As a thank you most levels of donations have a perk attached to them. What's a perk? A perk is either a physical good or service that Muay Thai Ontario will facilitate delivering to you once the fundraiser ends. We have partnered with InFightStyle to bring you EXCLUSIVE #TeamOntario2015 apparel and gear, that will only be made for this limited run.PLEASE NOTE: There may be minor variances between the product images and finished product.
There are other ways you can support
Muay Thai in Ontario than through financial donations. Share our fund-raising
campaign on various social media platforms and help get the word out on the
street. If you have the time, you can volunteer, or, alternatively, Muay Thai Ontario
is always looking for talented individuals who want to assist with our campaign
