<p>Hi, my name is Bernard and Im 20 years old. I decided to left my homeland for my dream and went study to Scotland because i think here i will have more opportunities for my dreams.</p>
<p>Right now im in the middle of building my porfolio for apply for university and im reworking on 3d animation project. Unfortunately my old laptop broke down and i have no other facilities for continue at my project and building of my porfolio. I need powerful laptop so i would be able to continue do what I started. I already have all developes done and ready to make it real, i just need tool.</p>
<p>im working part time because i have college three times per week and i need to pay my rent and food. I dont have any bursary or funding from school. I dont have any support from my family so i dont have any chance to earn enough money in time.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>This is my personal statement for university where I explainied my dreams and plan for my future.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Why have I decided to study this course? Because, I need the experience to help me succeed in being successful in a career that I really want to do in my future. I need to know more about what I would like to do and I need explore this part of art in more depth. Im learning in my own time too but I need professional explanations and demonstrations from people who already have the experience I desire.</p>
<p>Why am I so interested in this subject? Because it has always been what I wanted to do. <br/>My mother used to work as designer and through her I learned to see art everywhere around me. I was always surrounded by artists. She was responsible for decoration of whole buildings where as my grandmother used to work for company who designs patterns and designs for textiles.</p>
<p>Art is something that I live in. I’m the kind of person who is always looking for art everywhere. In my case graphic design, packaging, typography, photography are what I'm truly interested in doing and generally I think I have a good sense of balance and harmony in these areas of art and have developed a good sense of what looks right so far although I realise that I have still have much to learn.</p>
<p>I have had a few useful experiences from high school where I was responsible for complete design, layout and cover page of high school magazine. In those four years I started using and learning software like Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign and Corel Draw. I have only been to one Photoshop course, after that I taught myself how to use all this software with the aid of watching various tutorials and reading many blogs. People often approach me asking me if I can design posters or various postcards for them because they know that I love to do it and I like a challenge and any chance to prove myself.</p>
<p>My past study was always connected or centered around art, after high school I graduated in art history and decided leave my home country and go to Scotland where I studied Advanced Art and Design at Banff and Buchan College and now currently I'm studying HNC Art and Design, this is now my second year of Art and Design here in Scotland. I think I won’t have any major problems with English language since I was studying this language for more than nine years at school plus two years of real life experience here in Scotland.</p>
<p>Self motivation is one of my strengths and I invest all my free time sketching, drawing, trying to bring my ideas from my imagination alive. Its not easy because I don't have much free time but for the things I love Im always able to find time even at work I will bring my sketch book with me and work on things in my breaks or when its quiet. My hobbies are creatively focused: listening to great music while I'm drawing or designing something on my laptop. I also love reading, mainly fiction and fantasy books and specialized art magazines and blogs such a tumblr.com.</p>
<p>I have been studying English since primary school and then at higher lever in high school. After graduation I decided to try something new and leave my country, so I went to study abroad. I decided to try International Banff and Buchan College. I decided to become independent when I was nineteen, get my own apartment and pay my own bills, get a job. It is not easy but I learnt a lot in a very short time which has taught me a lot about responsibility and the realistic world.</p>
<p>After this course I would like to get a job in a design studio and then after a few years when I have gained some experience I would like to start my own business and start freelance. My plan is start work at home and after that when I will have more clients I would like to rent my own design studio, hire some talented and hard working people to my studio.</p>

<p>University of Nebraska students, professors, and Lincoln's <a href=""http://www.communitycrops.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Community CROPS</a> have teamed up to transition a former asparagus patch on East Campus into a productive farming plot operating under organic, sustainable practices.

<p>However, the growing season is primarily during the summer months--or, in other words, during summer break. Hoop houses, or high tunnels, are incredible tools when it comes season extension. This means we could begin our growing season while students are finishing out spring semester and prepare things for the summer months, when student volunteers may be less available. The season will then continue into the fall semester when students return. With this addition to the farm, we can grow more to serve more and offer more opportunities for students who will be away during the summer to get experience working on the farm.</p>

I'm taking an English Honours program with a Film Studies minor. I have been freelancing for FRANK Magazine since 2011 and recently started writing for Halifax's alternative weekly newspaper, The Coast. My contributions to the Arts section include DVD reviews. The first DVD review I wrote was one of the most wonderful occasions in my academic and professional career. I never want to stop writing about film.Why I Want Your Dollars There's a film class happening at the University of Toronto this summer titled ""Special Topics in Genre and Modes: B Movies and Cult Cinema."" I've been accepted to the University of Toronto. I have the time and motivation but I can't attend without financial assistance.This class will bring me one step closer to finishing the longest BA in history. More than that, this opportunity
will contribute to my academic, professional, and personal development beyond anything I could have hoped for this summer.What I NeedLet me break it down for you fine folks: I need $4000 CAD to fund this academic adventure. Application: $100Tuition: $1400Residence: $1600Flight: $500Food: $400Total: $4000I have been awarded $1500 CAD from the lovely people who administrate the Fountain School of Performing Arts Summer Program Awards. I am able to contribute $500 CAD straight from my lint-filled pockets. That leaves $2000 CAD that I need to fill and that's where you come in.Every little bit helps.

We are raising funds to cover the legal cost so the children could be freed from undertaking heavy religious responsibilities on a daily basis. Please contribute and share this campaign with people in your network.<br/><br/><h2>The Children and their Religious Responsibilities</h2>My brother and his children live in Melbourne, Australia. He is the father of three beautiful girls – the sunshine of his life. Do you have children? And if so, do you believe they should be free to learn, play and have fun as children instead of praying 5 times a day, recite holy Quran every day and wear hijab at the ages of 5 and 10? If you said yes, then I really need your help.<b><br/><br/></b>In January 2003, my brother and his wife separated. Until final court orders, the children live with their mother. Over a two year period and without my brother’s knowledge, the wife converted to a fundamentalist Muslim by a local Islamic group who believe in the practice of Sharia (Islamic) law. The girls – who are 10 year old twins and a 5 year old – are now being coerced by their mother to pray 5 times a day, during the night, even in their lunch break at school. Children are also instructed to recite holy Quran every day and wear hijab in public and at school. A major part of children’s day is taken away to undertake religious observances.<br/><br/>My brother doesn’t believe that such young children should be brainwashed and forced into practicing religious rituals mandated only for Muslim adults. He wishes to see the children learning, playing and participating in extracurricular activities and just enjoying being children. When they are adults, they can decide for themselves which particular religious ritual they want to practice and how often. For now, the kids should be allowed to be just kids without heavy religious responsibilities.<b><br/><br/></b>Children have rights and parents and adults have responsibilities. Children rights are being abused in the name of religion and political correctness. You can put a stop to this! <br/><br/><h2>Legal Fees</h2>So I am helping my brother raising money for the legal fees to fight for his children’s religious freedom. He has a 1-day court hearing in March 2014 and a 4-day hearing in June 2014 where his legal team will argue that his ex-wife has no right to indoctrinate, instruct and force the children to practice adult-like heavy religious practices on a daily basis. It’s a big issue which will require expert academic and religious evidence and the legal fees are very expensive. I would like to raise about $40,000 alone to pay for the legal team. Can you help?<br/><br/>I can’t offer gifts for your kind donations but a promise to send hugs from the children and their hand-drawn digitally converted artworks. You will have full commercial rights to these artworks. You will be contributing to an issue of international importance and towards the future of 3 very special girls. Please help if you share our view that kids should be free to be kids, it is their right.<br/><br/><h4>Please help in the best interest of the children.<br/>
</h4><h2>
<br/>Other Ways You Can Help</h2><p>If you can't contribute financially, just spreading the word to everyone you know is just as valuable! Please share this campaign with people in your social network by Facebook, Twitter or or by good old fashioned email. Thank you, your help will be much appreciated.<br/></p><p></p></div>","I have created this campaign on behalf of my younger brother and his three young children.

<h3>For Teachers</h3>
</div><div><ul>
<li>Save time! No need for newsletters any longer. Keep all families or individual families current with a no hassle, 60 sec message sent from your mobile phone or computer.</li>

<li>Send individualized updates on a particular student to families each day, every few days, or weekly.</li>
</ul></div><div><br/></div><h2>The Questions</h2><ul>
<li>How would knowing more about the school day change your conversations with your children at home?</li>
<li>If you knew more about what happened in school, would your children be better students? Would they be happier?</li>

</ul><h2><br/></h2><h2>Who We Are</h2><p>We are educators, working with more educators, families, professionals and software developers to build a company acutely focused on needs in education today. We are dedicated to building innovative resources that incite and excite learning. Our products are created by rethinking current educational issues and concerns. Others, come from our passion to expand the current learning environment. With our Wink App, we aim to fill families in on what their children do during the school day. We were founded in early 2013. Wink is our first product.</p><p>We are Educate Einstein. <a href=""http://www.educateeinstein.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.educateeinstein.com</a></p><h2><br/></h2><h2>How Wink Will Change the World!!! <i style=""font-weight: normal;"">Or at least, let a whole bunch of kids know we care.</i>
</h2><p>Teachers don't need research to tell them (although it does) that families who are well-informed and involved in their children's education, more often raise kids who are successful students. One of the main challenges we face however, is less and less time in our day. This makes communication between school and home much more difficult. We think in this day and age, we should be able to do better. So…we built Wink.</p><h2><br/></h2><h2>What We Will Use the Funds For</h2><p>Any funds raised from this campaign will go directly to the final build and testing phase of the Wink App. We have the great people at <a href=""http://www.zco.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Zco Corporation</a> ready to build our app!  Our problem is that the well of funds for this project has nearly dried-up! <b>Please participate by donating and/or passing the campaign along!</b></p><h3><b>Main Elements Covered In The Build</b></h3><p></p><ul>

Communicate the school day home. Help us build the Wink App so you can better help your kids!SimpleThe Wink App is a new, convenient, no-hassel educational app built around communicating the school day back to families. Web and mobile options allow teachers quick access to sending one-way messages home to parents. Parents receive the messages in their email in-box or on their mobile device. Informal and relaxed. Just the good stuff so you can help your kids.Key Features of the Wink App

Focused: geared toward early childhood through middle school students and families

Informational: built with the goal of helping school come home

Seamless: ease of use for teachers and for families is our priority

Functional: informal, one-way messages starting with the teachers 

Available: teachers login online or via the mobile app and send to family preferred smartphones or an email in-box
What does Wink do for YOU?For Families and Students

Lessons make their way home unobtrusively 
Parents are better informed, so in turn can help their children more effectively
Generate better performance by students knowing that their teacher and family are working as a team.
Greater continuity between home and school

For Teachers

Save time! No need for newsletters any longer. Keep all families or individual families current with a no hassle, 60 sec message sent from your mobile phone or computer.
Less misscomunication and questions from parents.
Improved relationships with families. 
Send individualized updates on a particular student to families each day, every few days, or weekly.
The Questions
How would knowing more about the school day change your conversations with your children at home?
If you knew more about what happened in school, would your children be better students? Would they be happier?
Would more communication from the classroom home, positively affect a teacher's own performance?
Who We AreWe are educators, working with more educators, families, professionals and software developers to build a company acutely focused on needs in education today. We are dedicated to building innovative resources that incite and excite learning. Our products are created by rethinking current educational issues and concerns. Others, come from our passion to expand the current learning environment. With our Wink App, we aim to fill families in on what their children do during the school day. We were founded in early 2013. Wink is our first product.We are Educate Einstein. www.educateeinstein.comHow Wink Will Change the World!!! Or at least, let a whole bunch of kids know we care.
Teachers don't need research to tell them (although it does) that families who are well-informed and involved in their children's education, more often raise kids who are successful students. One of the main challenges we face however, is less and less time in our day. This makes communication between school and home much more difficult. We think in this day and age, we should be able to do better. So…we built Wink.What We Will Use the Funds ForAny funds raised from this campaign will go directly to the final build and testing phase of the Wink App. We have the great people at Zco Corporation ready to build our app!  Our problem is that the well of funds for this project has nearly dried-up! Please participate by donating and/or passing the campaign along!Main Elements Covered In The Build

We are spreading the good in this world by giving away random acts of kindness! What could a paid cup of coffee or covered fare to send a package do for others? We can tell you, at the very least, it makes people smile. After that? We believe one good deed deserves another.  Keep an eye on it through our Facebook page or on our website.

<h3>What is this campaign about?</h3>
<p>Hello/Sawatdee Kup/Sabaidee, My name is Christopher Jilley. Two very good friends of mine David Burrows and Chris Corbett and I have visited Thailand, Laos and SE Asia a number of times and have ridden around much of Thailand and Laos by Motorcycle. During our visit's we have always been overwhelmed by the beauty and friendliness of the people of Laos. Given the hardship and loss the country and its people have endured over the years, being the most bombed country on earth, the love and friendship the Laos people are so willing to share is so Inspiring. The children of Laos want so much to learn and some travel long distances to attend schools with very little equipment to assist in their learning other than of course the vital support provided by the devoted families and teachers.</p>
<p>We realise that we can only do a little, but a little goes a very long way! We have raised funds through our workplaces and friends and our own donations so far to raise funds to purchase school/sports equipment as well as bicycles to give to schools to help their students get to school where no public transport is available or can be afforded.</p>
<p>We invite you to join us on our Tour via our Blog <a href=""http://illyjay.blogspot.com.au/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">http://illyjay.blogspot.com.au/</a><a href=""http://illyjay.wordpress.com/thailand-and-laos-bike-tour-2013/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a> <span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">where from November 1st 2013 to November 24th 2013 we will be riding around these beautiful countries and down the Ho Chi Minh trails in Southern Laos, bringing a book party to a School as well as later in the trip donating Bicycles to a school(s) in Luang Prabang.</span></p>
<p>If you are able to and willing to support us in this good cause we promise you it will make a difference!</p>
<p>We will of course post receipts for the purchases with 100% of the money raised going directly to the people of Laos in the form of School Equipment and/or Bicycles. When we arrive in Luang Prabang at the end of this campaign and we will see how many more bicycles we can/it makes sense to purchase and any further left over funds will be used for the next Book Party(s)/Good Cause(s). Whilst David and I only have 3 weeks in Asia this time, our good friend Chris Corbett (Who started Riding Laos for Good Causes and runs <a href=""http://www.motorcycle-tours-laos.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.motorcycle-tours-laos.org/</a> was key in organising all of this) will continue his good cause work after we have left and we are excited about the amazing things that can be done.</p>
<p>David and I are regular visitors to the region and plan to keep visiting regularly to continue Riding for Good Causes and look forward to sharing these experiences with you! :)</p>

potters helps preserve their traditional culture and gives them
income-generating skills.



WE'VE REACHED $4000. WHAT'S NEXT?
Training more potters does no good if they don't have places to sell them. SWOPA would love to be able to show their work at Le Salon International de l'Artisant de Ouagadougou, an international arts and crafts fair in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso. (That's the next country to the north. Ouagadougou is about 1/2 a day away.) In the past it's been prohibitively expensive, but last year some of them went to check it out. (See the photo.) Money raised over $4000 would help them have a booth at the 2014 fair.

SOME BACKGROUND
The people of Sirigu in northern Ghana are culturally rich but economically poor. The village is known for its indigenous architecture, pottery and wall designs. They maintain a traditional lifestyle. Many still live in intricately painted mud houses. Changing weather patterns, however, have hurt their agrarian economy, and new sources of income are needed. The revival of its traditional arts has become an important source of revenue. Additional income from pottery helps Sirigu women pay for school fees, food and other needs of their families.





Pottery is central to the culture of the women. Besides creating it for their own domestic and
ritual uses, the women sell it in local markets. Like the designs on their houses, their pottery has symbolic designs, telling stories and often invoking the protection of the gods. 
In the past, girls learned pottery in their home, but fewer are now learning this way. SWOPA, the Sirigu Women's Association of Pottery and Art, has been developing new markets for pottery, enabling pottery sales to be a more signifiant part of a family's income. 


I first visited Sirigu in 2007 and have been back twice since. When I was there in January, 2013, I asked the potters what I could do to help. They requested that I raise money to finance a program to train young women to be potters.
THE TRAINING PROGRAM
The training program will be made available to women in the village between the ages of 20 and 35 to assure that Sirigu's traditional pottery making skills are transferred to a younger generation.


Four thousand dollars provides a month-long
training program for 10 women, funding two experienced trainers and materials. 
Besides learning to make traditional
pots, trainers will teach the women marketing and business skills. 

The women
will also learn something completely new to the village – to fire their pots in a new
community kiln. Currently pots are fired in a large bonfire. The next
generation of potters needs to know how to use a kiln and fire to higher
temperatures. Higher-fired pots can be transported without breaking to markets
in larger cities to the south, giving the potters a broader customer base.



SWOPA - The Sirigu Women's Organization for Pottery and Art
In 1997, the Sirigu Women’s Organization of Pottery and Art (SWOPA) was founded, with the aim of preserving traditional culture and increasing their income through ecotourism and the sale of their pottery and art. Since
its founding in 1997, the goal of SWOPA has been to produce high quality pottery that has its roots in
the village culture. SWOPA has built
an arts center where it sells the work of local potters, established tourist
accommodations including guest rooms in traditionally decorated huts, and a
restaurant. It provides guided tours of the village and workshops in pottery,
basket weaving and drumming. They are moving towards marketing their pottery to
galleries and hotels in the larger cities to the south.

     trip to <b>Togo, Africa</b> is just the start to the amazing journey that I know
     God has ahead for me.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">My past semester at Lee University, I started as a Business
     major. At the end of the semester, within two weeks time I changed my
     major to Intercultural Studies (Missions work) with a Business minor. I
     also met the missionary couple that I would be going on my trip with the
     very next week. During this time, I was in consistent prayer, desperate
     for God to reveal to me what he desired for my life. I know that this
     opportunity is not a coincidence, but it is a divine appointment from God.
     This will be a life changing experience, and your contribution would allow
     this transformation to begin to take place.</span></p><p></p><ul>
<li>I could attempt to explain to you what your donation
     would mean to me, but I do not think that I could even begin to cover the
     surface. On this trip, I will encounter children of all ages, families of
     all numbers. All of these individuals have one thing in common: they are
     in need of wholistic <b>miracles</b>. They need food, CLEAN water, medical help,
     love, encouragement, and most of all, they need to know Jesus Christ. By
     donating towards this trip, you would allow hundreds, even thousands of
     people in Togo to have the opportunity to get this wholisitic healing. </li>

<p>Here is the break down:</p>
<ul>
<li>There are many things that the donations would be going
     towards.<b> $4,500 </b>is not just a number. That includes the flights, down payments,
     registration fees, the housing, the food required to bring to Africa,
     vaccination costs, medications, a camera, luggage bags, travel toiletries
     and hygiene products, etc. <br/>
     - $4,020 is the exact cost of the trip itself. This would cover flights,
     down payments, registration fees, and housing. Everything else is required
     by the missionary to come up with on their own. Deadlines for my payments
     are on April 27<sup>th</sup>, 2014 and June 27<sup>th</sup>, 2014.<br/>- I am also required to get a yellow fever vaccination before leaving. In order to make sure I will be safe in Togo, it is recommended to get <b style=""text-decoration: underline;"">at least</b> 3 more shots. This can get <i>pretty</i> costly. (Which vaccinations? Take a look here: <a href=""http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/destinations/traveler/none/togo"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Health Information for Travelers to Togo</a>)<br/><br/>
</li>
<li>I bet you’re thinking, “What will I get out of this?”
     Well, good news! Any donation you make towards this trip is <b>TAX
     DEDUCTIBLE</b>! All you have to do is make sure you do not submit anonymously
     when you donate online. After the campaigns are over, I will get the names
     of the donors and contact each one with the information and where to
     send it to get your tax deduction.<br/><br/>
</li>
<li>Even if the goal is not reached financially, the money
     will still go towards the trip. I will be making campaigns to raise money
     until the trip deadlines. If one campaign is over, you will still have a
     chance to donate!</li>

<p></p><p></p></div>","About MeHi! I’m Brooklyn Holbrook. I’m a passionate, dedicated,
     loving girl who is just looking to fulfill God’s plan for my life. This
     trip to Togo, Africa is just the start to the amazing journey that I know
     God has ahead for me.My past semester at Lee University, I started as a Business
     major. At the end of the semester, within two weeks time I changed my
     major to Intercultural Studies (Missions work) with a Business minor. I
     also met the missionary couple that I would be going on my trip with the
     very next week. During this time, I was in consistent prayer, desperate
     for God to reveal to me what he desired for my life. I know that this
     opportunity is not a coincidence, but it is a divine appointment from God.
     This will be a life changing experience, and your contribution would allow
     this transformation to begin to take place.
I could attempt to explain to you what your donation
     would mean to me, but I do not think that I could even begin to cover the
     surface. On this trip, I will encounter children of all ages, families of
     all numbers. All of these individuals have one thing in common: they are
     in need of wholistic miracles. They need food, CLEAN water, medical help,
     love, encouragement, and most of all, they need to know Jesus Christ. By
     donating towards this trip, you would allow hundreds, even thousands of
     people in Togo to have the opportunity to get this wholisitic healing. 
What We Need & What You Get
Here is the break down:

There are many things that the donations would be going
     towards. $4,500 is not just a number. That includes the flights, down payments,
     registration fees, the housing, the food required to bring to Africa,
     vaccination costs, medications, a camera, luggage bags, travel toiletries
     and hygiene products, etc. 
     - $4,020 is the exact cost of the trip itself. This would cover flights,
     down payments, registration fees, and housing. Everything else is required
     by the missionary to come up with on their own. Deadlines for my payments
     are on April 27th, 2014 and June 27th, 2014.- I am also required to get a yellow fever vaccination before leaving. In order to make sure I will be safe in Togo, it is recommended to get at least 3 more shots. This can get pretty costly. (Which vaccinations? Take a look here: Health Information for Travelers to Togo)

I bet you’re thinking, “What will I get out of this?”
     Well, good news! Any donation you make towards this trip is TAX
     DEDUCTIBLE! All you have to do is make sure you do not submit anonymously
     when you donate online. After the campaigns are over, I will get the names
     of the donors and contact each one with the information and where to
     send it to get your tax deduction.

Even if the goal is not reached financially, the money
     will still go towards the trip. I will be making campaigns to raise money
     until the trip deadlines. If one campaign is over, you will still have a
     chance to donate!
The Impact


Not only does this trip to Africa expose
people to God’s love, but it also involves bringing about a change of the
living conditions in Togo. Innocent people are suffering every day from the
contaminated water there and as a result, many children are orphaned daily. Mentor Leaders continues to work hard to supply clean water,
provide homes for the orphans, and they are educating them to grant them the
same opportunity for a thriving life. 


Traveling with a
worship choir at Lee, I have been able to witness the lasting impact that
ministry makes on people’s lives. I desire to see that same
change in these people’s lives. Please know that by donating to this cause, you
would be investing into a child's
eternity. 


Other Ways You Can Help
Even if you can’t
contribute, that doesn’t mean you can’t help! Some other ways to make this
dream come to life:
Spread the word! The more exposure of this trip, the
     better.
Share this campaign on your social media. Your friends
     are your friends for a reason!
One of the most important things: Partner with me in prayer.
     For the kids, the missionaries, the circumstances. I believe in the power
     of prayer. 
If you have ANY questions or concerns feel free to contact me bholbr00@leeu.edu.

It
is a page dedicated to capturing people’s photo while sharing a personal
thought or story, based on the question asked by Brandon (the founder). On this
particular day a photo was posted with a lengthy story about how the man in the
photo and his wife adopted their first child. After hearing the story, Brandon asked if he could post the full story. The man
said yes and then asked if there was any way to raise money for the little boy
they had waiting to be adopted as their second child. The goal was to raise
$26,000 dollars for this family. In one hour the goal was met. With continued out-pour, Brandon kept the fundraiser open for a period of time that evening. Beginning around 4:00PM, it was closed at 11:59PM. $83,935
dollars was raised in that short window of time for this family. 4,569 funders,
an average of $18 dollars donated per person. <br/><br/>
I was blown away. After taking a moment of gratitude for those who funded this
project, it was no more than a minute later that my thoughts came to those
dying of some related cause to starvation every day around the world. Whether
it be lack of food or clean water. I thought about what $83,935 dollars could
do. And so began my research. <br/><br/>
We sponsor children from Compassion International. Compassion International
exists as a Christian child advocacy ministry that releases children from
spiritual, economic, social and physical poverty and enables them to
become responsible, fulfilled Christian adults.<p></p>
<p>Founded by the Rev. Everett Swanson in 1952, Compassion began providing
Korean War orphans with food, shelter, education and health care, as well
as Christian training.<br/><br/>
Through their online resources I went to their gift catalog where you have
the freedom to give according to where you feel led. The first thing that I saw
was the title “Safe Water for Life”, clicking through I learned that for $30
dollars you can provide a family with a water well. For $79 dollars you can
provide a family with a water filtration system. 1,062 families could have
received a water filtration system for the amount of money raised by Humans of
New York. In continued
research through Compassion I found that for as little as $14 dollars a
mother and infant will be provided with food and nutritional supplements for one
month. $168 dollars will meet their needs for a year! The options are endless in
being able to help, these are just a few to gain perspective. </p>
<p>On November 5th I received a packet in the mail from Compassion with 6
pictures of little children waiting to be sponsored. The cost to sponsor one
child is $38 dollars per month. 2,208 children could have been sponsored with the
funds raised by Humans of New York. <br/><br/>
As I have thought about this issue my mind continues to be boggled by the small
percentage of people that gave, raising more than enough funds
needed. Imagine if everyone gave? World hunger would be abolished! Something I
can't even wrap my head around! And yet when I see something done like raise
$83,000 dollars in a short window of time, I have great confidence and hope that
it can! </p>
<p>Today more than 50 percent of children alone are bound in the chains of
poverty. More than 6 million children die each year from malnutrition. There
are more than 9 million deaths related to hunger each year. <br/><br/>
Those numbers are staggering. And it’s on my watch. On your watch. If Humans of
New York can raise nearly $100,000 dollars in less than a day for one family,
why can't we raise enough money to feed the world.<br/><br/>We are approaching a holiday based on thankful giving.<br/><br/>As a follower of Jesus Christ I am called to feed His sheep. Please join me in feeding the sheep of this world by giving. <br/><br/>12,500 children could be sponsored if we reach our goal of raising $1,000,000.<br/><br/>Sound impossible? <br/><br/>Have hope. All things are possible through Christ. <br/><br/>SIDE NOTE: I have been approached on the matter that some people already contribute to Compassion International by way of sponsorship. Begging the question why give here if giving is already happening there? <br/><br/>I created Feed the Sheep in comparison to what Humans of New York did. However, the take away and purpose here is to glorify God in the process of doing something radical for the public to see. I want to put emphasis on the power of those in Christ Jesus and what can happen when the body comes together. I want to take what was done through a secular source and change it into a movement to further God's Kingdom. <br/><br/>Whether you give her or directly to Compassion is your choice. I would simply ask that it be done here to show the world who our God is, and what He is capable of. I believe that Feed the Sheep will not only be a way to conquer poverty, but a way to bring those watching to Christ. <br/></p></div>","Total amount collected will go specifically to the Compassion International Philippines Disaster Relief donation. On October 30th I saw a post on Facebook by Humans of New York. It
is a page dedicated to capturing people’s photo while sharing a personal
thought or story, based on the question asked by Brandon (the founder). On this
particular day a photo was posted with a lengthy story about how the man in the
photo and his wife adopted their first child. After hearing the story, Brandon asked if he could post the full story. The man
said yes and then asked if there was any way to raise money for the little boy
they had waiting to be adopted as their second child. The goal was to raise
$26,000 dollars for this family. In one hour the goal was met. With continued out-pour, Brandon kept the fundraiser open for a period of time that evening. Beginning around 4:00PM, it was closed at 11:59PM. $83,935
dollars was raised in that short window of time for this family. 4,569 funders,
an average of $18 dollars donated per person.

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>For 6 amazing months of my life I lived in a boys orphanage in Klong Toey, a slum of Bangkok.  During this time I was surrounded by children who had been through more than I could imagine but who were happier and more thankful than any I had ever encountered.  The orphanage was one of six that is run by The Human Development Foundation Mercy Centre.  More inspiring than the positivity and strength of the children were the adults who took care of them.  From the house moms and kindergarten teachers to those who found sponsors and raised money, I have never met more generous and dedicated people.  Every single person associated with The Mercy Centre is 100% committed to the poor, the children, the sick, and the entire community.  </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Apart from the six orphanages the HDF Mercy Centre also runs slum kindergartens across the city of Bangkok, combats child trafficking, is home to an HIV/AIDS hospice, provides aid to the community, and has opened schools in the island communities as well.  I could go on and on but you can also go to <b><a href=""http://mercycentre.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://mercycentre.org</a></b> to read about the different projects, see pictures, and hear first hand from Father Joseph Maier, the heart and soul of Mercy.  The Mercy Centre is one big family and the love that flows from person to person is contagious.  They have become my family now and, as it is Christmas, I want to send the best present I can think of: the gift of hope, health, and a future.</p>

</div><div>
<p>As I am sure you all know Thailand sustained immense flooding this year, flooding that ruined houses, destroyed food supplies, put schools out of commission, and caused sickness.  The people of the slums suffered greatly and the Mercy Centre worked diligently to keep the community safe and happy.  Food and resources were stretched thin, but they are a strong group of people and prevailed.  Right now the Mercy Centre is in more need than ever for our love and support to keep everyone staying afloat after the destruction from the flooding.  The Mercy Centre will never turn down a child who needs help regardless of funding or space.  Every cent donated by companies or sponsors goes directly to the those who need it, I can testify to seeing this myself.  Money donated goes to food, clothes, school uniforms and supplies, and healthcare to ensure each child is properly cared for.  </p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>My goal is to raise $3000 to send to the Mercy Centre.  This is the estimated amount it takes to provide total care for one year to a child living in one of the Mercy Centre's houses.  Total care when sponsoring a child includes education, food, healthcare, housing, and most importantly LOVE!  Even if we don't make it to $3000 I will send every penny to Father Joe because the Mercy staff will certainly be appreciative of any amount we can give them.  I am in regular contact with Father Joe and the Mercy Centre staff and can guarantee that all money donated will be safely transferred to the foundation.  These are hard times, trust me as a broke law school student I understand, but when I say that every little bit helps I literally mean that every little bit helps.  Please look into your hearts and give the gift of life and love to my brothers and sisters in Thailand during this holiday season.</p>

<h3>The Legacy of Loveness</h3>
<p><strong>There are many organizations doing great work in Africa including House of Loveness (HoL).</strong> One difference with our NGO is that we are <em>focusing on fewer children and using community resources to build programs and opportunities that creates jobs and empowers the children, their families and the local community</em>.</p>
<p>In 2008, filmmaker Betsy Blankenbaker went to Zimbabwe to adopt a baby that had been abandoned. Her name was Loveness. She died as Betsy was arriving in Africa.  Betsy buried Loveness in the fertile soil of Zimbabwe and then promised to never go back.  That same trip,  Betsy met Kuda, Primrose, Cheepo and Tariro. They had also been abandoned.  Kuda was pushing himself across a hospital floor on his hands because he couldn't walk. Betsy thought to herself, <em>Okay just one more trip to Zimbabwe to bring Kuda a wheelchair.</em></p>
<p>That was nearly four years ago and Kuda is now playing soccer and going to school.  It was all possible through House of Loveness, an NGO which Betsy founded after burying Loveness and which is supported through donations of money and supplies from hundreds of<strong><em> House of Loveness heroes</em> </strong>all over the world.</p>
<p><strong>In 2010, HoL helped open a school that gave the children the opportunity to start their education. </strong> There are now 30-36 children attending the year-round school. <em>HoL is now ready to empower the older children in our program through</em> <em>the gift of a <strong>private boarding school education</strong> in Zimbabwe.</em></p>
<p><strong>Kuda, Primrose and Brighton are all ready to start boarding school in September.</strong> Tariro and Cheepo will follow them a year later.</p>
<p>We realize that greater opportunities in life will come for the children through receiving a private school education. <em>We believe in the future of these children. Do you?</em></p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We desire that our 8 and 9 year old HoL children start private boarding school (with your help) in September 2012.  The annual school fees are $2,400 per child.  <strong>The first children to be sponsored for the HoL boarding school program are Primrose, Kuda and Brighton</strong>.  When HoL first began supporting these children in 2008, Primrose and Kuda were living in the children's ward of a local hospital. </p>
<p>Brighton, age 9, is a local boy supported by HoL since 2011. His parents died several years ago and Brighton had been caring for himself and his grandfather when we met him. He had never been to school. <strong>With support from HoL and his grandfather's blessing, Brighton is now looking forward to going to boarding school and playing on the soccer team.</strong></p>
<p><strong>And what about you?!</strong> By donating to this campaign we have some fantastic perks from<strong> postcards from Zimbabwe and artwork by the children</strong> to a <strong><em>Service &amp; Safari trip</em></strong> to Zimbabwe for two to <strong>visit the House of Loveness children and experience the beauty and soul of Zimbabwe</strong>. <em> Give yourself a bonus perk by visiting Victoria Falls on your way home.</em></p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>HoL supports emergency short-term and long-term needs of at-risk children in Zimbabwe.  Most of the children have been abandoned or orphaned.  <strong>Through HoL, the children are living beyond the wounds of their past and growing into happy, empowered children with a future full of possibilites.<br/></strong></p>
<p>In just four years, <strong>HoL has helped nearly 100 children</strong> through donations to the local hospital, moving abandoned and ophaned children into private housing with local caregivers and paying school fees for children to attend school for the first time in their lives.</p>
<p>Last year, through the <strong>successful IndieGoGo campaign <em>Susie's Birthday Wish</em></strong>, over $5,000 was raised to pay the school fees, food and supplies for the HoL children and we celebrated in Zimbabwe with a massive birthday party for London-based<strong> House of Loveness hero Susie Sourwine</strong> who gifted her annual birthday party to the HoL children. For many of the children, it was their first time to make a wish and blow out the candles on a birthday cake.</p>
<p>The funds raised from the <strong><em>Share Your Heart</em></strong> campaign will go towards private school fees and school supplies for the children. Any additional funds raised from this campaign will go towards to continued support of the school HoL sponsors in Zimbabwe.</p>

<h4><b>¡<em>Hola</em>! </b></h4>
<p><span>  My name is Laura and I am a senior
at the University at Albany working towards a double major in Urban Studies
&amp; Planning and Globalization with a minor in Spanish.  I have an opportunity to study abroad in
Santiago, Chile during my fall semester at 
ECELA (Español y
Cultura en Latino America) Spanish Language School. I will be in Chile from August 17<sup>th</sup>-
December 5<sup>th</sup>, 2014.  Please help me make this amazing opportunity
happen! I receive grants that will cover the full coast of tuition and housing abroad. I need to raise money for my airplane ticket, textbooks, meals, and to help my
family with living expenses while I am away and unable to generate income.  In total I need to raise $5,000. We have a stretch goal of $6,000 for the unforeseen living expenses that are sure to arrive.  </span></p>
<p><span>  Studying in Chile has been a long
time goal of mine.  If I do not take
advantage of the funding I have now, I may never be able to go.  Your support is vital in helping me actualize
my dreams for my family, education, and career. <br/></span></p><p><span><img class=""rg_i lazy"" data-src=""https://encrypted-tbn2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcRWNLNtXykLSrD1W3uHeEIN0eAXgUTGpY6-W9rGhisDMn_fmv6BEw"" name=""Z61Wzki6QZg5QM:"" src="""" style=""""/><br/></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><i>Santiago, Chile - Photography by Morten Andersen</i></p><h4><b>Why Santiago, Chile?</b></h4>
<p><span>  Studying and living in Santiago will
undoubtedly enhance my education as an urban planner in a way that is
impossible to get by only studying on my home campus.  </span></p>
<p><span>  During the last half-century cities
in the United States experienced a steady population decline.  This is not the case for the majority of the
countries in the world, which are undergoing rapid rates of urbanization and
growth.  The metropolitan area of
Santiago is home to over 6 million people and is the third largest city in
South America. Its rapid growth has presented Chile with urban planning challenges
that have created opportunities for innovation and creativity. Experiencing Santiago will expose me to new urban
planning strategies I can bring home with me. Practicing urban planning or
understanding globalization requires a robust understanding of Latin America;
this is something I hope to set a foundation in by studying in Chile. </span></p>
<p><span>  To anchor my education I have committed
to learning Spanish. I recently received two A’s by completing an intensive 3 week class in Puerto Rico. I
have also successfully completed a year of Spanish classes at my home
university. However to become fully
fluent I need a longer emersion experience. 
In Chile, I will be living with a host family and communicating in
Spanish every waking hour of the day.  I
will complete 4 formal Spanish classes (15 credits). </span></p>
<p><span>  Finally learning Spanish is very
important to my family, outside of any career or educational goals I might
have.  My spouse and children are Puerto
Rican and our children have repeatedly asked for help in learning Spanish.  They have visited Puerto Rico and have dreams
of going to school there.  My partner can
speak Spanish, but increasing family members who are fluent would help our
children immensely. </span></p><p><span><img alt="""" class=""spotlight lazy"" data-src=""https://fbcdn-sphotos-f-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xap1/t1.0-9/149905_1698954799443_6465212_n.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 263.613px; height: 227px;""/></span></p><p><span><i>The kids and I the year we first went to PR</i><br/></span></p><h4><b>Risks
&amp; Challenges</b></h4>
<p><span>  My path in higher
education has been non-traditional.  I am
a thirty year old undergraduate student helping to raise two kids. My journey
in undergraduate education has been a windy road, eight years in the making. I
have remained dedicated and now I am very close to graduating. When college
students study abroad they typically are able to put their belongings in
storage and just go.  For me it requires
not just raising funds for a plane ticket and food, but helping my incredibly
supportive and loving family while I am gone. 
I will be unable to work at my current job as a secretary and my spouse
will still need to pay rent, pay bills, and take care of the kids.  Life will not be put on hold till I come
back. </span></p>
<p><span>  That said, given that I
have my tuition covered, and a host family able to house me, this will be the least expensive opportunity to study abroad and live in a foreign
country that I will ever have. I am a senior this year. If I do not go now, I
may never be able to go. This is why my family and I have decided that despite
the challenges and difficulty in being apart, now is the perfect time. It’s
literally now or never!</span></p><br/><h4>What we need</h4>

December 5th, 2014.  Please help me make this amazing opportunity
happen! I receive grants that will cover the full coast of tuition and housing abroad. I need to raise money for my airplane ticket, textbooks, meals, and to help my
family with living expenses while I am away and unable to generate income.  In total I need to raise $5,000. We have a stretch goal of $6,000 for the unforeseen living expenses that are sure to arrive.  
  Studying in Chile has been a long
time goal of mine.  If I do not take
advantage of the funding I have now, I may never be able to go.  Your support is vital in helping me actualize
my dreams for my family, education, and career. 

Santiago, Chile - Photography by Morten AndersenWhy Santiago, Chile?
  Studying and living in Santiago will
undoubtedly enhance my education as an urban planner in a way that is
impossible to get by only studying on my home campus.  
  During the last half-century cities
in the United States experienced a steady population decline.  This is not the case for the majority of the
countries in the world, which are undergoing rapid rates of urbanization and
growth.  The metropolitan area of
Santiago is home to over 6 million people and is the third largest city in
South America. Its rapid growth has presented Chile with urban planning challenges
that have created opportunities for innovation and creativity. Experiencing Santiago will expose me to new urban
planning strategies I can bring home with me. Practicing urban planning or
understanding globalization requires a robust understanding of Latin America;
this is something I hope to set a foundation in by studying in Chile. 
  To anchor my education I have committed
to learning Spanish. I recently received two A’s by completing an intensive 3 week class in Puerto Rico. I
have also successfully completed a year of Spanish classes at my home
university. However to become fully
fluent I need a longer emersion experience. 
In Chile, I will be living with a host family and communicating in
Spanish every waking hour of the day.  I
will complete 4 formal Spanish classes (15 credits). 
  Finally learning Spanish is very
important to my family, outside of any career or educational goals I might
have.  My spouse and children are Puerto
Rican and our children have repeatedly asked for help in learning Spanish.  They have visited Puerto Rico and have dreams
of going to school there.  My partner can
speak Spanish, but increasing family members who are fluent would help our
children immensely. The kids and I the year we first went to PRRisks
& Challenges
  My path in higher
education has been non-traditional.  I am
a thirty year old undergraduate student helping to raise two kids. My journey
in undergraduate education has been a windy road, eight years in the making. I
have remained dedicated and now I am very close to graduating. When college
students study abroad they typically are able to put their belongings in
storage and just go.  For me it requires
not just raising funds for a plane ticket and food, but helping my incredibly
supportive and loving family while I am gone. 
I will be unable to work at my current job as a secretary and my spouse
will still need to pay rent, pay bills, and take care of the kids.  Life will not be put on hold till I come
back. 
  That said, given that I
have my tuition covered, and a host family able to house me, this will be the least expensive opportunity to study abroad and live in a foreign
country that I will ever have. I am a senior this year. If I do not go now, I
may never be able to go. This is why my family and I have decided that despite
the challenges and difficulty in being apart, now is the perfect time. It’s
literally now or never!What we need

<div>
<p></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">This campaign is about Rose,
Faith and Blessing, three girls who have gained admission to higher
institutions in Nigeria but would be unable to go to school without financial
help. Their faces are different but they share a common story. All three of them
have finished secondary school at least two years ago but due to financial
constraints, they have been unable to move on to a higher education. Rose’s
father suffers from partial paralysis and the family has had to depend on the meager
earnings from her mother’s petty trading for survival. Faith comes from a
family of peasant farmers whose harvests are dedicated primarily to feeding the
family and Blessing had to run away from an option of early marriage offered by
the family in the absence of resources to go to school. </p>
<p>These are three girls
with the desperate desire against all odds to have an education capable of
liberating them from their present poverty traps and that is why this campaign
was set up. Our goal is <b>to</b> <b>raise $6800
which is the estimate required for the three girls to go through two years of
school. </b>I
know how hard Rose, Blessing and Faith and their families fight to overcome the
basic task of daily survival. A higher
education will greatly improve their chances of breaking this vicious cycle of
poverty. This is why we need your help so these girls would not have to bring the unfortunate circumstances of their present into their future.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Rose, Faith and Blessing may not be
the girl next door. In fact, to you, they are probably total strangers in a
distant corner of the world. But in the end they are 3 human beings… individuals
like you with dreams and aspirations and desperate to achieve them. Wherever we
are from, we are all connected by our humanity. I truly believe that by virtue of
this connection, you can lend a hand to help these girls achieve their simple
dreams. Unless you have been there, you truly cannot imagine how much your generous donations will transform their lives. We need your help.</p>

<p>
</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Poverty continues to
stand as one of the principal hindrances to the enrollment of girls in tertiary
education throughout the developing world. Roseline, Faith and Blessing have shown a strong desire for higher education but are unfortunately caught in a poverty trap. Your contribution to this campaign, will make a huge impact upon the lives of these 3 girls . </p>
<p>In a Nigerian economy with high unemployment and stiff competition for jobs, without higher education these girls do not stand a chance at leading a better life and breaking this  vicious cycle of poverty, with repercussions even for their unborn children. By contributing to this initiative<span>, you are providing a
potential gateway to poverty reduction and the achievement of sustainable
development on a personal level for the girls and Nigeria in general.</span></p>
<p><span></span></p>
<p>Women are, by default in Nigeria, disadvantaged with respect to economic and socio-political empowerment. A higher education will provide these girls the tools needed for independence, save them from potentially looming early marriages that would only further their cycle of poverty. On a larger scale , with a higher education they will be better equipped to contributing towards the overall development of Nigeria and by extension to global development.</p>
<p>Nigeria still has one of the worst maternal and child mortality rates in the world. Harmful cultural practices like disinheritance and female genital mutilation are some of the unfortunate things women still suffer. Without a doubt, women who are educated and economically empowered are less likely to suffer these unfortunate situations. By contributing to this campaign, you would be empowering women educationally, and consequently economically and politically.</p>
<p></p>
<p><span>Of particular importance is the opportunity for these girls to
access all levels of education in order to take advantage of the growing
opportunities in Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics (STEM)  and  related areas. Being underrepresented in these fields of study, your help will therefore propel these girls to go beyond their
""expected"" boundaries.</span></p>

My name is Itodo Anthony. I hold an MSc from Heriot-Watt University, Edinburgh, Scotland. I also
belong to Junior Chamber International, an organization for young people where
we believe that service to humanity is the best work of life. I have always
volunteered service to create positive change.  In Edinburgh, I worked as a volunteer with the

Please join us in giving these girls a fair chance.</div></div>","HELLO


This campaign is about Rose,
Faith and Blessing, three girls who have gained admission to higher
institutions in Nigeria but would be unable to go to school without financial
help. Their faces are different but they share a common story. All three of them
have finished secondary school at least two years ago but due to financial
constraints, they have been unable to move on to a higher education. Rose’s
father suffers from partial paralysis and the family has had to depend on the meager
earnings from her mother’s petty trading for survival. Faith comes from a
family of peasant farmers whose harvests are dedicated primarily to feeding the
family and Blessing had to run away from an option of early marriage offered by
the family in the absence of resources to go to school. 
These are three girls
with the desperate desire against all odds to have an education capable of
liberating them from their present poverty traps and that is why this campaign
was set up. Our goal is to raise $6800
which is the estimate required for the three girls to go through two years of
school. I
know how hard Rose, Blessing and Faith and their families fight to overcome the
basic task of daily survival. A higher
education will greatly improve their chances of breaking this vicious cycle of
poverty. This is why we need your help so these girls would not have to bring the unfortunate circumstances of their present into their future.

Rose, Faith and Blessing may not be
the girl next door. In fact, to you, they are probably total strangers in a
distant corner of the world. But in the end they are 3 human beings… individuals
like you with dreams and aspirations and desperate to achieve them. Wherever we
are from, we are all connected by our humanity. I truly believe that by virtue of
this connection, you can lend a hand to help these girls achieve their simple
dreams. Unless you have been there, you truly cannot imagine how much your generous donations will transform their lives. We need your help.


THEIR STORIES


 
Roseline Yusuf is the 4th child in a family of 5
children ( 7 in total) , a family in a dire financial situation that threatens to deny her
a simple dream of an education. Rose is 19 and finished high school 2 years ago
but had to wait until now to gain an admission to study Computer Science at
Federal Polytechnic Idah, Nigeria. Rose needs help to afford school. For the last few years, her
dad has been unable to work due to partial paralysis, and with a mother engaged in
petty trading, the meagre family resources have been dedicated to the uphill
task of daily survival. Rose is due to resume school by the end of February and an estimated
cost of $2075 is what she needs to
complete a 2-year National Diploma. Rose needs our help to achieve a simple dream. Will
you help her?




Faith Aver Toryila is 19 and has just been offered admission to study
Social and Environmental Forestry at the Federal University of Agriculture,
Makurdi, Nigeria. Without financial assistance, she is going to have to forfeit
the admission, and sadly, this would not be the first time. Three years after
completing her secondary school education, she is still unable to go on and
study for a higher degree. At the moment, there are musings within her family to get her married  in order to cushion her family's economic challenges. This may be her fate if she does not get financial assistance. Together, we can help
avert that fate. Her programme is a 5-year degree; this campaign aims to
help her through the first two years. An estimated $2054 is what stands between Faith and this goal. Kindly lend a hand.




Blessing Godday is 19 and has also had to forfeit admission due to
lack of financial support. This year she gained admission again to study
Laboratory Science Technology and I started a campaign on Facebook on December
5, 2014 to raise money for her. The campaign generated $476
with which she has paid her fees and obtain accommodation. Blessing still needs
help for books, transportation and feeding. This campaign aims to raise enough funds for the duration of her 2-year National Diploma. The estimate to
reach this goal is $1610. Kindly
help Blessing to finish the programme she has started. 

OUR NEED
 
The objective of the campaign is
to raise enough money to finance two years of tertiary education for each of
the girls. For Blessing and Roseline that would be enough to earn a National
Diploma, however Faith would have 3 more years to earn her degree. The
estimates used here involve fees, accommodation, living expenses (basically
feeding) and miscellaneous (books, internet, transportation, printing, etc.) needed per year and then upscaled to cover 2 years for each of them.
Roseline:
Fees - $227, Accommodation - $
216.20, Living Expenses – $432.40, Miscellaneous - $162.20
Total per year = $1037.80, Total
for TWO YEARS = $2075.60
Faith:
Fees - $216.20, Accommodation - $
216.20, Living Expenses – $432.40, Miscellaneous - $162.20
Total per year = $1027, Total for
TWO YEARS = $2054
Blessing:
Fees - $232.40, Accommodation - $
189.20, Living Expenses – $432.40, Miscellaneous - $162.20
Total for first year (fees and
accommodation already paid from Facebook fundraising, hence only living expenses and miscellaneous needed) = $594.60
Total for second year = $1015,
Total for TWO YEARS = $1610
Total for 3 Girls = $5739
Amount required to meet above total = $6308 (Since 9% of funds go
to the website). We are also allowing $500 for buying and delivering perks, hence:
Campaign Target = $6800
PLAN OF ACTION
Roseline is due
to resume school late March and Faith resumes early April. Blessing is already in
school and only needs funds for living expenses for the rest of the session.




Campaign Target:  $6800


Campaign Duration:  26th
January 2015 – 6th March 2015 (40 days)


A trust fund would be set up with a bank
under the Develop a Youth (DAY) foundation which would be registered in Nigeria
this January.


Between late March and early April realized
funds would be disbursed  to pay for fees and housing for first
year and living expenses for the first semester (4 months)

Funds would be deposited into Trust
Fund bank account and instructions left with the bank to disburse funds to the
beneficiaries' accounts subsequently as follows:
Fees and accommodation for the session, at
the beginning of each session

Living expenses per month at the beginning
of every month from the second semester for 2 years


If the funds raised do not meet the target
of the campaign; priority will be given to the tuition fees and accommodation fees.


Once tuition and accommodation have been paid for,the remaining funds
will be  evenly distributed and paid to the beneficiaries during the target
duration of the assistance (two years).


If the funds raised are more than the target
amount; the excess would be used to pay for the beneficiaries’ studies beyond
the first two years of their studies as planned.


The Develop a Youth Foundation would also
find scholarship resources which the girls will be eligible for upon resumption
of school and help them access such funds.


WHAT YOU WILL HELP US ACHIEVE
   


Poverty continues to
stand as one of the principal hindrances to the enrollment of girls in tertiary
education throughout the developing world. Roseline, Faith and Blessing have shown a strong desire for higher education but are unfortunately caught in a poverty trap. Your contribution to this campaign, will make a huge impact upon the lives of these 3 girls . 
In a Nigerian economy with high unemployment and stiff competition for jobs, without higher education these girls do not stand a chance at leading a better life and breaking this  vicious cycle of poverty, with repercussions even for their unborn children. By contributing to this initiative, you are providing a
potential gateway to poverty reduction and the achievement of sustainable
development on a personal level for the girls and Nigeria in general.

Women are, by default in Nigeria, disadvantaged with respect to economic and socio-political empowerment. A higher education will provide these girls the tools needed for independence, save them from potentially looming early marriages that would only further their cycle of poverty. On a larger scale , with a higher education they will be better equipped to contributing towards the overall development of Nigeria and by extension to global development.
Nigeria still has one of the worst maternal and child mortality rates in the world. Harmful cultural practices like disinheritance and female genital mutilation are some of the unfortunate things women still suffer. Without a doubt, women who are educated and economically empowered are less likely to suffer these unfortunate situations. By contributing to this campaign, you would be empowering women educationally, and consequently economically and politically.

Of particular importance is the opportunity for these girls to
access all levels of education in order to take advantage of the growing
opportunities in Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics (STEM)  and  related areas. Being underrepresented in these fields of study, your help will therefore propel these girls to go beyond their
""expected"" boundaries.
  OTHER WAYS TO HELP We would be grateful if you could help us by sharing our campaign among your friends through email or your Facebook , Instagram and Twitter profiles and encouraging them to make a donation. You can also make book donations in the fields of Laboratory Science and Technology, Computer Science and Social/Environmental Forestry.
Many thanks for your contribution and for changing a life!

<h2><b>Our Farm</b></h2>
<p>Our school, gardens, nursery, and
apothecary are located on 40 acres in a rural mountain cove in Madison County,
North Carolina.<span>  We started from scratch
on this undeveloped land in 2001 and have added to it little-by-little, working
with limited resources.  By now it
features a number of small houses built with natural building methods (clay,
straw, sand, poles harvested from our land), a large communal kitchen, several
permaculture gardens watered by year-round springs, a solar-powered electrical
system, a stage for performances, and even an elaborate treehouse.</span></p>
<p>Our neighborhood is made up of
old-school Appalachian mountain folks, who’ve lived here for many generations.<span>  Herbal medicine was still practiced as
primary care when some of them were children, but is now a dying
tradition.  Still, they mostly avoid
doctors, and they're pleased to have herbalists in the neighborhood again,
even if we don’t practice quite like Granny did!</span></p><p><span></span></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1459468368/DSCF3500_l0jqer.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

since we began, and every year we have to turn away more applicants because our
facilities cannot accommodate more than a handful of students.  Also, the lecture classes are held in our
lovely but open-to-the-elements communal kitchen &amp; dining space, <b>and</b> <b>we are

<h2><b>Why We Are Reaching Out<br/></b></h2>
<p>In everything that we offer to the
world, whether it’s giving health advice, dispensing herbal medicine, distributing
medicinal plants, or teaching budding herbalists, we have chosen to avoid a

greater community that we are seeking community support to expand what we can
do.</b></h3><p><br/></p>
<h2><b>How We’re Going to Build It</b></h2>
<p>In the fifteen years since we started

we’re going to build it ourselves, with the help of our summer apprentices (who

land for as much of the lumber as possible.<span> 
We’ve cut a number of Tulip Poplars to clear the building site, and our
neighbors are converting them to lumber with their sawmill operation.</span><p><span><br/></span></p>

<br/></div>","We have a vision:  an herbalist in every community, able to
provide skilled, sensitive, accessible holistic health care, using nature's
gifts as their tools and nature's wisdom as their guide.  Everyone should have an herbalist to turn
to.  Herbalists go to the root causes of
disease instead of just managing symptoms. 
They empower people to take control of their own health, relying on
plants from the garden and the wild lands nearby, and on simple practices that
you can do at home.  If everyone knew an
herbalist, no one would have to solely rely on our expensive, unjust, and
inadequate medical system.The Terra Sylva School trains exactly
this kind of community herbalist in our unique full-immersion summer internship
program (read on for why our program and our location is so special).  But we have outgrown our facilities, so this
year we’re building a new facility that will house an indoor classroom, our
extensive research library, our herbal apothecary, and an attached greenhouse
for growing medicinal herbs.  
We have our
design ready, we have labor lined up, our neighbor’s sawmill is ready to
provide the lumber.  We’re asking you to help with the cost of materials.

Our Work
Medicine County Herbs is an herbal apothecary & medicinal plant

Appalachian cove forest near Asheville, North Carolina.  Our herbal practice was born of
full-time immersion in this forest, the richest ecosystem in Appalachia.  We share this immersive experience with our students
each summer in our residential apprenticeship program, the Terra Sylva School.An herbal education does more than
inform an individual student—its impact reverberates as students share their
healing knowledge with friends, family, and community.  At our school, we seek to sow the seeds of
generations of community herbalists by providing an inclusive and safer space for passionate
students of all genders, races, ethnicities, and economic backgrounds.  We differ from other herb schools in that we
provide an education in radical, DIY, community-minded herbalism in a rural

Students live on our farm through the

permaculture gardens watered by year-round springs, a solar-powered electrical

Our neighborhood is made up of
old-school Appalachian mountain folks, who’ve lived here for many generations.  Herbal medicine was still practiced as

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Pathway to Certification is a start up company founded by two Board Certified Behavior Analysts, Erica Bauer and Lisa Nikiforuk. Both Erica and Lisa have worked in the field with children and adults with Autism and their families. They have supervised students on the path to taking the certification exam to become Behavior Analysts.</p>
<p><strong>What motivated us to start this company/website? </strong></p>
<p>The number of people pursuing certification and becoming BCBA's is growing, as is the need for quality supervision of future practitioners. We believe that educators, families, and businesses in need of behavior analytic services deserve to have well trained, highly prepared Behavior Analysts working with you. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1531089569/fffadhdnqhlchrdxqo9e.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>(BACB.com)</p>
<p><b>What will your contributions do? </b></p>
<p>You will be helping to create a website for supervisors and supervisees to keep track of accrued supervision hours, and mastery of skills required to become exceptional Behavior Analysts.</p>
<p><b>Why should they need to keep track of their supervision in such a way?</b></p>
<p>This tool will allow supervisors to monitor their supervisees progress by visually displaying areas of strength and areas for improvement, while also tracking the number of supervision hours they are accruing as required by the board. This will help supervisors navigate their supervision curriculum and provide access to resources, projects and practice opportunities that will help their student focus on the skills they need to improve.</p>
<p><b>Who are Board Certified Behavior Analysts and what do they do?</b></p>
<p>A Board Certified Behavior Analyst® (BCBA®) is a behavioral health professional who develops &amp; implements treatment plans towards positive behavioral changes &amp; life skill acquisition.</p>
<p>BCBA’s hold a graduate-level certification in behavior analysis. Professionals who are certified at the BCBA level are independent practitioners who provide behavior-analytic services. In addition, BCBAs supervise the work of Board Certified Assistant Behavior Analysts, Registered Behavior Technicians, and others who implement behavior-analytic interventions (BACB.com).</p>

</div></div>","Short Summary
Pathway to Certification is a start up company founded by two Board Certified Behavior Analysts, Erica Bauer and Lisa Nikiforuk. Both Erica and Lisa have worked in the field with children and adults with Autism and their families. They have supervised students on the path to taking the certification exam to become Behavior Analysts.
What motivated us to start this company/website? 
The number of people pursuing certification and becoming BCBA's is growing, as is the need for quality supervision of future practitioners. We believe that educators, families, and businesses in need of behavior analytic services deserve to have well trained, highly prepared Behavior Analysts working with you. 

(BACB.com)
What will your contributions do? 
You will be helping to create a website for supervisors and supervisees to keep track of accrued supervision hours, and mastery of skills required to become exceptional Behavior Analysts.
Why should they need to keep track of their supervision in such a way?
This tool will allow supervisors to monitor their supervisees progress by visually displaying areas of strength and areas for improvement, while also tracking the number of supervision hours they are accruing as required by the board. This will help supervisors navigate their supervision curriculum and provide access to resources, projects and practice opportunities that will help their student focus on the skills they need to improve.
Who are Board Certified Behavior Analysts and what do they do?
A Board Certified Behavior Analyst® (BCBA®) is a behavioral health professional who develops & implements treatment plans towards positive behavioral changes & life skill acquisition.
BCBA’s hold a graduate-level certification in behavior analysis. Professionals who are certified at the BCBA level are independent practitioners who provide behavior-analytic services. In addition, BCBAs supervise the work of Board Certified Assistant Behavior Analysts, Registered Behavior Technicians, and others who implement behavior-analytic interventions (BACB.com).

<p>my name is Marco Ricci and I am a 37-year-old art historian with Austrian and Italian family background. I live in Vienna and have always been interested in genetics, genealogy and the migration patterns of ancient tribes and peoples. When I was a child I fantasized that one day it would be possible to tell from your DNA who your ancestors were. Nowadays we live that childhood fantasy of mine! People from all over the world learn that their lineages are connected and help us to develop a feeling of global culture awareness!</p>
<p>Two years ago I learned about the possibilities of genetic genealogy and had my own Y-DNA tested. The resolution of the initial test was very small as I only could afford a 12-marker test. When I received my results I was nevertheless astonished. I turned out to be Y-DNA haplogroup J1! From my experience every European has that <em>WOW!</em> feeling once he discovers to belong to J1 as this is a quite rare haplogroup in Europe but very common in the Middle East. From that very moment I wanted to know more about my male ancestors and their ethnic background. After a Deep Clade test I was sure to belong to a big cluster that is present in Arab as well as in Jewish and other Middle Eastern populations. This cluster is called J-L147.1. My curiosity grew stronger and stronger!</p>
<p>The more SNPs I tested the more I was fascinated by this group as my sample tested negative for all subclade-defining SNPs downstream from L147.1 except L858! I began to read internet forums, scientific studies and post here and there and eventually became volunteer project co-admin of the FTDNA KMY and Y-DNA Haplogroup J Project. My enthusiasm has not diminished since then but is steadily growing because of the innovations genetic genealogy is undergoing! A big step in the last years is the possibility to have your complete Y-DNA (and not only single markers) sequenced and that is this project’s goal: raise the additional 1100$ that are still necessary to make this happen!</p>
<p>What are the benefits for the donors? Once my Y-DNA is sequenced, hundreds of new SNPs will be available for everybody. These single unique mutations will help clarify the phylogeny of my branch of haplogroup J1, namely J-L858! We will try our best and make these SNPs testable to the benefit of every single genetic genealogist. It could help us also understand when our ancestors arrived in Central Europe and which source population they were belonging to in the Middle East. Many fascinating new insights will emerge from this and a great many people will eventually profit from the results! By contributing to this project you help us make this happen! Even a small amount of money is giving us a helping hand and can be decisive in the realization!</p>

<strong>RUBY CUP: </strong><strong>Menstruation Matters</strong>
</h2>
<p>Ruby Cup is a menstrual cup that is re-usable for 10 years. With 400 of your tokens during Socap12, we will make sure that 250 primary schoolgirls in Kenya wont have to worry about their menstruation again until they are done with college. For many of them, this could mean that they will actually make it through school.</p>
<h3><strong>IT’S A BLOODY MESS</strong></h3>
<p>Menstruation is the main cause of school drop-out for girls in poverty and hinders women in achieving life opportunities. Sanitary pads are too expensive or simply unavailable. Instead, women use mud, bark, rags, cotton wool, pieces of mattress or pieces of newspaper. Unhygienic and undignified solutions. This is 20% of school/work time!</p>
<p>Just think about it, who would want to be seen leaking in public? Menstruation is a taboo, and an overlooked issue effecting more than 1 billion women and girls globally. Let’s help girls and women move beyond the shame.</p>
<p>My name is Veronica D'Souza and I am the co-founder and Managing Director of Ruby Cup. We provide a sustainable solution to menstruation for girls and women in poverty. With 1 Ruby Cup, a girl can go from primary through college with out having to worry about her menstruation.</p>
<h3><strong>RUBY CUP: A Sustainable Solution<img alt=""Ruby Cup"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.bkfarmyards.com/rubycup/Ruby%20Cup%20Packaging%202%20-%20Version%202small%20copy%202.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: right;""/></strong></h3>
<p>Ruby Cup is a high quality menstrual cup made of 100% medical grade silicone that is re-usable for 10 years. I personally use Ruby Cup because it is healthier than pads and tampons, cost-saving, safe, and environmentally friendly.</p>
<p>We are selling and distributing Ruby Cup in the slums of Nairobi through female entrepreneurs. This way, we generate income for women, increase peer-to-peer education about menstrual hygiene, and solve the problem sustainably. We also sell Ruby Cup online for a premium price in western markets (in case you want to get one for yourself or your wife) and use this revenue to cross subsidize the cost for women and girls in poverty.</p>
<h3><strong>THIS PARTICULAR CAMPAIGN: Schoolgirls in Kenya <img alt=""Diana"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.bkfarmyards.com/rubycup/IMG_1667small.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: right;""/><br/></strong></h3>
<p>With this campaign, at SOCAP12, you can  change lives for girls immediately.</p>
<p>All money raised through this campaign during SOCAP12, will be used to provide primary schoolgirls in the slums of Nairobi with a Ruby Cup. Each Ruby Cup comes with training and education about reproductive health.</p><p>We are a for-profit company, and there is an enormous market worldwide for Ruby Cup.</p>
<p>But there are primary schoolgirls who will never be able to afford our product. Let’s help them today.</p>
<h3><strong>THE BIGGER PICTURE </strong></h3>
<p>Our team is ambitious. Since we started one year ago, we have designed and produced our product together with the women and girls in Kenya. We have done acceptability testing and just launched sales in three different slum areas in Nairobi with our first commercial shipment of 10.000 units. We have 500 happy Ruby Cup users in Kenya, Uganda and South Africa in the age of 13 - 35. And we are just getting started.</p>
<h3><strong><img alt=""Sales Women"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.bkfarmyards.com/rubycup/Livelihoods%20small.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: right;""/></strong></h3>
<p>Our goal is to reach 1 million women and girls world wide over the next 5 years through both a market based distribution model that generates income for women and through donations in cooperation with NGOs and governments.</p>
<p>We cannot do it alone. I am here at Socap12 to meet with you, get connected to relevant partners, and fundraise $500,000 in grants and debt. I will be showcasing Ruby Cup all day <strong>Wednesday</strong> in the main hall. Write me, meet with me, and come and hear more about Ruby Cup. </p>
<p>Thank you on behalf of my team and the schoolgirls in Kenya.</p>
<p>Veronica D’Souza</p>
<h3><strong>Letter from Annet Shilaho 15 years old, Skt. Jones primary School, Kibera, Nairobi. </strong></h3>
<p>""My first day when I started my menstruation period I used rugs because my father did not afford to buy me a pad. I did not have anyone to afford to buy for me cause my mother had been already dead. I felt ashamed of myself. I stayed for a week at home because I thought it was not normal. I was very funny because I went everywhere telling people that the bleeding is come out of my vagina. A few days later friend introduce me to their life skills teacher. I explained everything to her and at last she promised to provide for me pads. </p>
<p>My opinion about Rub cup is that it helps me a lot because before I was using two pads per day. I thank Moraa and Ruby Cup because they made my dreams come true. Cause once before she came I was ashamed facing my father asking him to buy me pads. Ruby cup is my number one choice cause it has help me a lot. Since I started used it I have seen changes. It has even help me saving my dad’s money. I don’t have much to say all I ask you all is to bring more ruby cup to help others a lot. The thing is good a lot if even you wear it nobody will notice. </p>
<p>I prefer Ruby cup than anything else.""</p>
<h3><strong>TEAM</strong></h3>
<p>We are three young female entrepreneurs from Copenhagen Business School (Maxie, Julie and I) who have started Ruby Cup together. We now live in Nairobi where we are working full speed on introducing Ruby Cup in the slums. If you are passing by, we’ll happily invite you for a Bloody Mary.</p>
<p>Ruby Cup is the winner of The Global Social Entrepreneurship Competition 2012 (US), Venture Cup 2012 (DK), a selected Sustainia100 Solution, Finalist in Ben&amp;Jerry's Join Our Core 2012 (EU), Awarded Fidelity Future Impact Award 2nd prize 2012 (CH).</p>

The entrepreneurs were given 2 hours to develop their campaign page. The campaign will run for 1 week to an audience of 1500 global social innovators at SOCAP.  SOCAP attendees were given a wooden token representative of $5 that they will choose to designate towards 1 of the 5 project, in total worth $10,000.  Additionally, attendees are encouraged to further contribute both financially and otherwise. Though the entrepreneurs have financial goals far exceeding the small amount they will raise through the campaign, this exercise is a symbol of how crowd and community support towards inspiring and innovative individuals can leverage great resources to change the world.""</em> </p></div>","RUBY CUP: Menstruation Matters

Just think about it, who would want to be seen leaking in public? Menstruation is a taboo, and an overlooked issue effecting more than 1 billion women and girls globally. Let’s help girls and women move beyond the shame.
My name is Veronica D'Souza and I am the co-founder and Managing Director of Ruby Cup. We provide a sustainable solution to menstruation for girls and women in poverty. With 1 Ruby Cup, a girl can go from primary through college with out having to worry about her menstruation.
RUBY CUP: A Sustainable Solution
Ruby Cup is a high quality menstrual cup made of 100% medical grade silicone that is re-usable for 10 years. I personally use Ruby Cup because it is healthier than pads and tampons, cost-saving, safe, and environmentally friendly.
We are selling and distributing Ruby Cup in the slums of Nairobi through female entrepreneurs. This way, we generate income for women, increase peer-to-peer education about menstrual hygiene, and solve the problem sustainably. We also sell Ruby Cup online for a premium price in western markets (in case you want to get one for yourself or your wife) and use this revenue to cross subsidize the cost for women and girls in poverty.
THIS PARTICULAR CAMPAIGN: Schoolgirls in Kenya 
With this campaign, at SOCAP12, you can  change lives for girls immediately.
All money raised through this campaign during SOCAP12, will be used to provide primary schoolgirls in the slums of Nairobi with a Ruby Cup. Each Ruby Cup comes with training and education about reproductive health.We are a for-profit company, and there is an enormous market worldwide for Ruby Cup.
But there are primary schoolgirls who will never be able to afford our product. Let’s help them today.
THE BIGGER PICTURE 
Our team is ambitious. Since we started one year ago, we have designed and produced our product together with the women and girls in Kenya. We have done acceptability testing and just launched sales in three different slum areas in Nairobi with our first commercial shipment of 10.000 units. We have 500 happy Ruby Cup users in Kenya, Uganda and South Africa in the age of 13 - 35. And we are just getting started.

Our goal is to reach 1 million women and girls world wide over the next 5 years through both a market based distribution model that generates income for women and through donations in cooperation with NGOs and governments.
We cannot do it alone. I am here at Socap12 to meet with you, get connected to relevant partners, and fundraise $500,000 in grants and debt. I will be showcasing Ruby Cup all day Wednesday in the main hall. Write me, meet with me, and come and hear more about Ruby Cup. 
Thank you on behalf of my team and the schoolgirls in Kenya.

Letter from Annet Shilaho 15 years old, Skt. Jones primary School, Kibera, Nairobi. 
""My first day when I started my menstruation period I used rugs because my father did not afford to buy me a pad. I did not have anyone to afford to buy for me cause my mother had been already dead. I felt ashamed of myself. I stayed for a week at home because I thought it was not normal. I was very funny because I went everywhere telling people that the bleeding is come out of my vagina. A few days later friend introduce me to their life skills teacher. I explained everything to her and at last she promised to provide for me pads. 
My opinion about Rub cup is that it helps me a lot because before I was using two pads per day. I thank Moraa and Ruby Cup because they made my dreams come true. Cause once before she came I was ashamed facing my father asking him to buy me pads. Ruby cup is my number one choice cause it has help me a lot. Since I started used it I have seen changes. It has even help me saving my dad’s money. I don’t have much to say all I ask you all is to bring more ruby cup to help others a lot. The thing is good a lot if even you wear it nobody will notice. 
I prefer Ruby cup than anything else.""
TEAM

""This campaign was designed for the SOCAP conference community for it's annual gathering on October 1-4th.  A group of 100 entrepreneurs selected 5 entrepreneurs to showcase their work through a small crowdfunding campaign on Indiegogo. The entrepreneurs were given 2 hours to develop their campaign page. The campaign will run for 1 week to an audience of 1500 global social innovators at SOCAP.  SOCAP attendees were given a wooden token representative of $5 that they will choose to designate towards 1 of the 5 project, in total worth $10,000.  Additionally, attendees are encouraged to further contribute both financially and otherwise. Though the entrepreneurs have financial goals far exceeding the small amount they will raise through the campaign, this exercise is a symbol of how crowd and community support towards inspiring and innovative individuals can leverage great resources to change the world.""",3.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<p style=""display: inline !important;"">Hi Everyone,</p>

<div>
<b>
</b><p>My
name is Clara Lamai Nødskov Holm, I ́m 20 years old and my dream is to attend Marist College
in New York and play Division 1 Soccer.</p>
<p>I’m
Danish and part Thai, grew up in Denmark and attended International school near
Copenhagen. My family spent a few years in the UK and I have always appreciated
having a cultured network from all parts of the world. I graduated high school
with an IB Diploma (International Baccalaureate) to have a better chance of
taking my B.A. degree abroad.</p>
<p>After
graduation I spent two years working, traveling and doing internships, before
applying to college.</p>
<p>In 2013, I
spent three months as an intern at Jimmy Choo Ltd in London, in their
Communications Department, working with digital media. It was an amazing
experience and I have been interested in studying media and productions ever
since. </p>
<p>July
2013, I backpacked around America with my best friend for three months,
traveling from the East Coast to the West Coast. In New York, I met some
fantastic people who introduced me to Marist College.</p>
<p>Marist
is a small private liberal arts college on
the Hudson River in upstate New York. It has outstanding facilities for <i>“Media
Studies and Production in Film”, </i>an incredible campus, a great
selection of internships in New York City and also a Division 1 Women’s soccer
team<i>, The Marist Redfoxes</i>.</p>
<p>In Denmark education is free and
thus, I don’t have a college fund, but when Marist College caught my attention,
I was certain it was the school for me. I would love to study and live on a college campus
and to be able to play soccer at such a competitive level, with the students I go to school with. </p>
<p>I was well aware of the fact
that as a European the process of getting into an American College and funding
the tuition could be challenging, but I was up for it.</p>
<p>March
2014, I got my acceptance letter from Marist and my dream came much closer to reality. As I
am not able to cover the expenses on my own. I began applying for funds in
Denmark in order to achieve my goal. The chance of getting financial support
in Denmark for a BA in the US are
slender, so I figured that my American College dream might lie in getting
on the Marist soccer team, and potentially getting financial aid to finish my
education.</p>
<p>I
began training soccer intensively and working out every day. I know that
getting a chance to tryout and possibly make the team is hard work and requires certain skills, so I stepped
my game up both on the field and at the gym.  </p>
<p>I believe I have what it takes to play at such a competitive
level. Soccer has been a part of my life for 12 years. I have contacted Marist’s soccer coach and
I am eagerly awaiting her response. I am hoping to get a tryout when I attend
Marist this coming Fall.</p>
<p>As I need your help for my first
year at Marist, I am setting up this crowd-fund. Tuition is 45,000$ a year and
I am 20,000$ short. By helping me attend Marist, you give me a chance to make
the soccer team and fulfilling my college dream. </p>
<p>As I plan to study Media Studies
&amp; Production, I have decided to produce a video about the process of
getting into college in America, how it is to live on campus and my journey to
becoming a <i>Redfox</i>.  Such a video might serve to inspire other
international students who have the same ambitions that I do.</p>
<p>As I need
to start paying my tuition shortly, I would really appreciate your help. Give me a chance to show you, that I have what it takes to make the team. Please, share my story and support my dream of attending Marist College and
becoming  a <i>Redfox</i>! </p>

<p><b>Build Something Important</b></p>
<p>Provide youth in
marginalized communities with accessible arts education, leadership training
workshops, mentorship opportunities and meaningful employment.</p>
<p><b>Double your
Investment</b></p>
<p>If we can raise $5000, the Halsall Family Foundation will
match each donation dollar for dollar! That’s $10,000 to celebrate 10 years of
incredible Samba Kidz programming!</p>
<p><b>Drum Artz Canada And The Samba School Model</b></p>
<p>Samba schools were born in Brazil and use Samba music,
dancing and art as an instrument for social change and a way to build
community. Drum Artz Canada uses the Samba School model and Samba drumming to
empower youth and teach the value of community. </p>
<p>Samba represents a way of life; a culture based on
celebration of community that includes the participation of each individual
regardless of race, class, age, ability or gender. Drum Artz applies the core
values of Samba by using music and artistic expression as ‘equalizers’ that
break down barriers of race and class, fostering channels of meaningful communication
among diverse groups in our society. Drum Artz creates a social space where youth
are encouraged to collaborate and perform, and where the success of the
individual is critically dependent on the success of the group.</p>
<p><b>The Samba Kidz
&amp; Samba Youth Program</b></p>
<p>The Samba Kidz and Samba Program provide youth with meaningful learning experiences, leadership development opportunities, job skills training, meaningful employment and, of course, the joy of Samba music!</p>
<p>Our Samba Kidz receive training in Samba music, steel pan,
visual arts, stilt walking and more, from some of Toronto’s most exciting
professional artists. Within this structure of arts-based learning, our youth receive
an experiential education in team building and collaboration through the
collective creation of music and art, expanding their cultural outlook through
an appreciation of world music, and the power of peer-to-peer mentorship as the
older, more experienced players help teach novice musicians. Through
performance opportunities at various events and major festivals around the
city, Samba Kidz are also able to build self-confidence, experience positive
civic engagement, and develop a broader sense of community. </p>
<p>Our Samba Youth participate in additional leadership
training workshops and work on special skill-building projects. As youth
continue to progress through the program, they have the opportunity to be paired
with a professional mentor and explore potential career paths in a field of
their interest. The Samba Youth program also offers youth meaningful employment
opportunities as Interns or Youth Staff in our summer program. In addition to gaining
practical job-skills training and experience, our Samba Youth take part in
leadership workshops focusing on personal development (e.g. Goal Setting,
Overcoming Obstacles, Mental Health, etc.) and participate in a self-evaluation
process. </p>
<p><b>Accessibility</b></p>
<p>Our Samba Kidz and Samba Youth Program is a high
quality arts and youth leadership program led by professional artists and
passionate youth workers. While the costs associated with running a program of this caliber are quite significant, it is central to our organizational
mandate to make this program accessible to all families.</p>
<p>As such, Samba Kidz is a highly subsidized program with
95% of our families receiving a financial subsidy of up to 90% or more of the
total fee for our summer program, and our after school programs are offered for free. In order to support this model of funding, we rely heavily on the
support of corporate sponsors, private foundations, government funders and
individual donors like you!</p>
<p><b>Highlights</b></p>
<p>Since its inception in 2004, DAC has offered subsidized
arts education programs for hundreds of kids and families in Toronto’s marginalized
communities. The Samba Kidz Performing Troupe has performed at high profile
events such as The Beaches Jazz Festival, WE Day, Kensington Festival of
Lights, Muhtadi International Drum Festival, Easter Seals Telethon on CBC, and
at Dundas Square with Brazilian megastar Carlinhos Brown. In 2010, DAC was
named Royal Bank of Canada’s charity of choice and in 2011, Executive Director
Gili Zemer, was given the Community Cultural Champion Award by the city of
Toronto. In 2013, Samba Youth Jade Shortte, received an honorable mention in the
national competition for the Urban Leadership Awards for her work with Drum
Artz and “her commitment, dedication and leadership in her community, serving
as a role model to children and aspiring musicians”. In 2014, Samba Youth Joshua Witter-Lucas won a Student Leadership Award from the Durham Black Educators Network.</p><p><br/></p>

<p><strong>Interactive columns detect people's presence and behavior, creating amazing experience of sounds, lights and movements. The interaction between the viewer and the COLUMNICATION has been happening in the sensitive area of the installation, building up the ambience of emotional connection. Columnication itself is the ideological mirror of the relationship between  people. It represents different levels of communication in various situations. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Let get involved in this interaction:</strong></p>

<h3>How does it work?</h3>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://img687.imageshack.us/img687/6807/howdoesitwork.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>The columns spread emissions of ultrasound clouds through the sensitive area in order to receive back information of the surrounding area. A microcontroller inside creates and represents the unique profile of the viewer by changing the shape of the composition, the set of lights and sound of nature. The interaction depends on the distance, movement and number of persons.</p>
<h2><span style=""font-size: 15px;""> </span></h2>
<h3>Concept</h3>
<p>Every human being has an individual and unique perception of the surrounding environment and is reacting in different ways. The columns recreate this complex fusion, throughout the interaction between the viewer and Columnication. Our installation creates bonds between technology and art. And this is the most valuable part of the concept because it gives the viewers the opportunity to participate in this piece of art.</p>

Short Summary

We are a student team from Delft University of Technology, consisting of around 20 students, trying to build the most efficient hydrogen powered car in the world! We combine cutting-edge technology with creativity and engineering knowledge to build a vehicle we compete with in the annual Shell Eco-Marathon.

<h3>Bonjour à tous!</h3>
<div>Nous sommes quatre étudiantes de 16 à 17 ans. Aux mois de janvier et février prochains, nous partirons au Costa Rica avec l'organisme Global Crossroad pour venir en aide à de jeunes enfants démunis dans la ville d'Atenas. En effet, nous irons dans un centre pour enfants pour réaliser plusieurs activités avec les jeunes Costa Ricains pendant leurs vacances. Nous voulons d'abord et avant tout contribuer à améliorer leur situation de vie difficile principalement causée par le manque de ressources et la pauvreté auxquels ils sont confrontés. Ainsi, nous désirons apporter divers biens essentiels au sain développement des enfants (tels que des vêtements et du matériel scolaire), aider le village à se développer (travaux de construction) et apporter un soutien moral aux jeunes. </div>

<div>3. Peindre une murale sur le mur de l'église de la communauté.</div>
<div>4. Écrire un livre pour enfants illustré de dessins réalisés par les enfants. Nous souhaitons publier le livre à notre retour au Québec afin d'envoyer les profits à Atenas, pour permettre au village de continuer  à améliorer la situation de leurs enfants, et leur assurer un avenir meilleur.</div>

La comunidad de la Escuela de Inversión se compone de más de 5.500 y continuamente estamos haciendo eventos y creando sinergias entre profesionales del sector para acercarle a todo el mundo la educación financiera.
www.laescueladeinversion.com es el portal de difusión propio con gran afluencia, además al ser un portal educativo, divulgativo y de formación tenemos muchos colaboradores que apoyarán la causa. Estimamos poder llegar a 20.000 personas en suma de todas las personas que nos visiten.

<p>This year our school closed its doors and left us without a place to go. We have several students that have social disorders, need one-on-one attention, and have mild autism. These students have come from many different backgrounds that include public schools and homeschools.</p>
<p><em>""Our teacher decided that she could not see her students have to go to a new school and make new friends. So she decided to homeschool some of us. Soon parents got word of this and wanted in. Next thing we know we have 30 students that did not want to go back to public school.""</em></p>
<p>So a few parents got together and decided to start a school for the students - Nest Academy Utah. We have most of what we need except a building and school starts in just a few short weeks.</p>
<p>We are not under the umbrella of any church so that we can better meet the needs of the families that come from all different denominations and religious backgrounds.</p>
<p><strong>What Have We Done So Far?</strong></p>
<p>We have obtained our corporation and built a board that consists of teachers, parents, and local business owners. We have our bylaws and paper work ready to be filed with the 501(c)(3) at the IRS. We have desks, chairs, chalkboards, computers, students, and teachers. We have found a building that we like...</p>
<p><strong>What Will Funds be used for?</strong></p>
<p>Our goal is to raise enough money to pay for the deposit and lease for the first few months. In addition, we will need to cover monthly expenses as we continue to build our student body. These expenses will include remodeling, art supplies, and pay for our 501(c)(3) application. </p>

<p><strong>How Can You Help?</strong></p>
<p>First and foremost, we welcome your dollars! There are costs associated with both launching and seeding a fruitful, long-term venture like this! (Did we mention we are thinking BIG? We want to grow in our community as a safe place for our kids to go to school.)</p>
<p>Second, we would love your help getting the word out that Nest Academy Utah is here in Salt Lake City. We cannot be everywhere and we do not know everyone who will want to be involved, so we really need your help. Sharing on Facebook, Twitter, G+ or your favorite online or real-life networks of choice increases our chances of getting our building in time for school to start this season. Otherwise, our students will have no where to go.</p>
<p><strong>What Happens if We Do not Meet Our Goal?</strong></p>
<p>All funds will go toward the school, Nest Academy Utah, whether we reach our goal or not.</p>

<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<p>We really believe that this is what God will have us do! Many children’s education is counting on our school to start and we are trusting that the funds will be there in time.</p>
<p>Our students have not had a positive educational experience in other school atmospheres and have grown and flourished in our care. We have been able to teach them the importance of education in a family atmosphere. Our goal is to help these children become lifelong learners in spite of their learning disabilities, social disabilities, or bad experiences in education.</p>
<p>We have a vision to strengthen the family unit by offering after hour courses that will teach our parents and the community how to succeed. We strongly believe in partnering with the parents to create as firm a foundation at home as they have at school.</p>

<h3>What this Project is About</h3>
<p>Hello and THANK YOU for coming to our campaign page!  Have you watched the video yet, posted above?  It's only 2 minutes long but it gives a good explanation of our project  I'm definitely not a movie star, but hopefully my message will be clear and you'll come away feeling that this is something you really want to be a part of.</p>
<p>I’m currently in the process of starting a vocational trade school in Mendoza, Argentina – it’s called Juntos Argentina (“juntos” is the Spanish word for “together”).  The school will be exclusively for lower class youth, and we will be teaching skills such as welding, auto repair, construction (carpentry, electrician, etc.) and commercial driving.  Our website gives a great explanation of everything --- <a href=""http://www.juntosargentina.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">www.JuntosArgentina.com</a></p>
<p>Juntos Argentina urgently needs to make a video, for use when meeting with people and organizations for donations, as well as recruiting potential board members.  I could talk for hours about the need for the school, but a video will have a lot more impact:</p>
<ul>
<li>Alfredo and Fabian talking about how the courses will teach them a technical skill that will open the doors of employment opportunities and help them to rise out of poverty</li>
<li>Business owners explaining how providing technical education to the poor will provide them will skilled workers</li>
<li>Community leaders commenting on how this type of education will benefit the families, communities, and country</li>
</ul>
<p>People often ask me what they can do to help Juntos Argentina, because they see the great value in providing education to poor youth, especially education that will directly result in employment and rising out of poverty.  Well, here's a simple, concrete way that you can help, and you'll know that the money is going directly to what you're donating for, and not for some administrative costs.  DONATE TO HELP MAKE A DIFFERENCE!</p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>To make a professional video, a videographer and I need to travel to Mendoza, Argentina and film various people, organizations, and locations.  The filming will take approximately five days, and the money needed will cover air fare, lodging, food, the videographer’s production fee, miscellaneous production costs, and the fee for editing what we film and make a finished, polished video.  A total of $9750 is needed for this video project, and friends have already donated $2500, so $7250 is still needed.  Normally a video like this would cost $30-40,000 but the videographer (Victor) believes strongly in Juntos and is giving us a great discount in his fees.</p>
<p>Together (“juntos”) we can make this video project a reality!  And...you’ll receive some cool perks like a postcard from Argentina or delicious empanadas - check them out on the right side of this page.  <strong>Please consider making a donation so that the video can be made and Juntos Argentina will be able to move forward with providing valuable education to lower class youth in Argentina.  </strong>Alfredo, Fabian, and thousands of youths like them will be so grateful that you care enough to make a difference in their lives!</p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Naturally, I’d be extremely grateful if you decide to make a donation.  Just as important though is to get the word out to your network of friends, family, co-workers, church, groups/clubs, Facebook, LinkedIn, twitter, blogs, etc.  This is a campaign, and we have a maximum of 30 days on this site to raise the funds.  So if you’re interested in taking an extra step and help spread the word, please send out a group email, or post on your Facebook, or whatever you can think of to <strong>get people to visit this page!  </strong>AND please “Like” us on the Facebook icon above this summary – that will help us so much!  The more times people view this page and “Like” it, and donate, the more prominent it will be displayed on Indiegogo and attract others who will want to donate.</p>
<p>Again, THANKS SO MUCH for deciding to help Juntos Argentina!</p>
<p>p.s. - feel free to contact me directly - <a href=""mailto:Paul@JuntosArgentina.com"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">Paul@JuntosArgentina.com</a> / 303-202-2636 - with any questions, comments or concerns.</p>

</h3> <p></p>
<p>Wooden Shoe Books has been in Philadelphia since 1976. The Shoe, as it is sometimes called, primarily operates as an infoshop, meaning that we function as a space where people gather, learn, and share ideas, news, and events related to our local radical communities. The infoshop is solely sustained by the passion of our volunteers. Functioning within a system we oppose, we seek to be an example of one way people can work together to challenge dominant power structures. As a collective, we do not have a boss or managers, but rather all of the decisions in the space are made through consensus by collective members and volunteers to empower everyone involved in the space to have a voice.</p>
<p>This past year has been tough on us. We are currently short on volunteers, and our core group has been stretched thin. We depend on sales and donations to ensure that we can pay the rent and other costs, and the winter months are particularly rough on us every year. As the collective is undergoing a much overdue restructuring, shifting our focus away from finances would allow us to focus on more important issues, such as building a stronger sense of community.</p>

Due to a lack of after school activities, we have partnered with the Abaco Youth Football Association (AYFA) in order to introduce the first ever youth football team to our little Island. The Bull Sharks is a flag football team, broken down into three age groups who compete with three other Abaco Islands. Our PeeWees are 6-9yrs old, our Juniors are 10-13, and our seniors are 14-17. <br/>
</div> <div> <h3>What We Need<br/>
</h3>Because this is out first year participating in the league, we are beginning from scratch. It is our hope that through fundraising, we can raise enough money to allow all island kids to participate in the sport, regardless of their ability to pay. Between team fees, player fees, insurance, uniforms, equipment and travel costs, we estimate that our start up cost to participate in the 2014-2015 season will be between $5,000 and $5,500. <br/>
</div> <div> <h3>The Impact<br/>
</h3>Introducing a football program to the island of Hopetown will a) provide youth with a positive way to spend their free time, b) introduce them to a sport which many have no knowledge of, c) provided much needed exercise for children who do not receive a regular PE program, and d) teach children the benefits of cooperation and being part of a team. <br/>
</div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Although all sports carry with them  a certain degree or risk, flag football is considered a non-contact sport. In addition, coaches go out of their way to  ensure proper training in flag pulling and blocking, thus further reducing the chances of injury. Should an injury occur, each player is covered by personal medical insurance which will cover the costs of any necessary medical care.<br/></p>
</div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>As of right now, the Bullsharks are in desperate need of funds in order to cover insurance costs, player fees, uniform costs and transportation to and from away games. Currently some coaches have spent their own money in order to purchase basic equipment, but we are currently training with rubber balls, and need funding in order for there to be any chance of the Bull Sharks being competitive in the coming months and years. <br/>

Currently some coaches have spent their own money in order to purchase basic equipment, but we are currently training with rubber balls, and need funding in order for there to be any chance of the Bull Sharks being competitive in the coming months and years.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

</h3><p>Hillcrest is a vibrantly diverse elementary school of 480 students in southeast San Francisco.  Over half of our students are on campus from <span>7:50 a.m. to 6:00 p.m.</span> each day and THIS is their playground.  They deserve better.  Our hope is to transform more than 5000 sq ft of cracked asphalt into a creatively designed and safe play space with an incredible turf soccer field as it's center piece. </p>
<p>With a strong investment in community, health, wellness, and
academics, America SCORES has been an ideal after-school offering for students
on campus for the last 12 years.  This
partnership has blossomed and spread over the years with the help of their
expert soccer coach Rudy Osorio, who has gone from coaching three
hard-to-defeat SCORES teams, to becoming a full-time staff physical education
instructor and icon in the neighborhood and soccer community.  </p>
<p>Hillcrest has created an environment rich in learning
opportunities for both the mind and body. 
Recreation and sport are valued for the inherent health and social
benefits. In fact, each Thursday the school hosts pick-up soccer games for all

With a strong investment in community, health, wellness, and
academics, America SCORES has been an ideal after-school offering for students
on campus for the last 12 years.  This
partnership has blossomed and spread over the years with the help of their
expert soccer coach Rudy Osorio, who has gone from coaching three
hard-to-defeat SCORES teams, to becoming a full-time staff physical education
instructor and icon in the neighborhood and soccer community.  
Hillcrest has created an environment rich in learning
opportunities for both the mind and body. 
Recreation and sport are valued for the inherent health and social
benefits. In fact, each Thursday the school hosts pick-up soccer games for all
the parents!  Principal Richard Zapien

for one hour a week for 20 weeks, during or after the school day.<span>  A variety of methods stir the students' interest:  discussion, journaling, video
clips, skits, students’ presentations, games, role-playing, and dyads – (where
the kids face one on one, often with someone they didn’t yet know very well, and speak
with honesty on a topic of importance to both.) And as one of our kids said<i>, “It’s the first time I felt someone was
really listening to me”</i> </span></p>

they now understand, to all areas of their lives! 
</span></span></p>
<p>We’ve learned from parents’ “before”

</p><p> <b><u><span>Methodology:</span></u></b></p>
<p>Kids Create
Peace is a 20-week, one hour per week, after school session, and
explores how conflict begins:  the cultural assumptions and judgments that
cause separation, prejudice, and hostility.</p>
<ul>
<li>The
     program introduces a set of concepts, to be understood and applied through
     experiential, “anchoring” activities, such as games, role-playing and
     short videos; written material, like songs, poetry, plays, speeches,
     quotes, and newspaper and magazine articles. These are chosen and
     used in ways that allow students to see how patterns of judgmental
     behavior and conditioned thinking create unwanted “drama”, trauma and
     stress in their lives – and in the lives of those around them.</li>
<li>Students
     learn the value of ‘journaling’ (recording their thoughts about class discussions
     and important things they can share with family members.)</li>
<li>We
     share a few moments of ‘mindfulness’ quiet time at the beginning of each

<li>We

<b><u>
</u></b><br/></div>","WHAT IF THERE WERE NO NEED FOR VIOLENCE PREVENTION?We have an answer!Bullying ​and violence ​among ​kids and ​you​th hasn't gone away. 
In fact it's getting​ worse!  ​A​nd ​it begin​s​ as early as kindergarten and doesn’t let up​.... ​It continues through
high school and beyond.  Bullying,​ and most shockingly, suicides, among children and youth of
all ages and backgrounds​ are being reported
from all over the country.​ This is true for racially
and gender motivated hate behavior also.
The effects are
devastating​ and result in​ school absenteeism, truancy, dropping out and increased
gang involvement: gangs ​replace broken family
ties, ​and lead to ​more violence.What Kids Create Peace Does 

We coach children  in learning essential life skills, (e.g. discernment; non-aggressive, non-oppositional communication; deep listening; critical thinking and leadership).
We assist them to discover and be free of limiting or negative concepts and beliefs, and to perceive, speak, and act without judgments that are reactions to the  beliefs or actions of others.
And to understand conflict: how it arises and how to prevent it. We provide tools of behavior to resolve conflicts and expand peacemaking skills of children and youth.
We strengthen their connection with, and commitment to their family, friends, teachers and other adults, their school and community.
We engage children with their families, schools and community in creating an enjoyable learning experience of caring individuals who model positive behavior and meaningful interactions.
We instill the pursuit and enjoyment of academic excellence that results from increased self-worth and self-esteem.
Watch
our short video! (Above) You’ll hear some of the kids
we’ve worked with share how KCP built their confidence, their respect for
others – and themselves; their desire and ability to cooperate, and create
together.
Your participation will help that happen for at least 300
more 'miracle' kids this next school year! 

Our Demographic  Our kids come mostly from low income families (75%) and middle income (25%); many with difficult or harsh living conditions; i.e. single parent family or with both parents working; 60% non-English speaking; some with gang-active household members. 

The Mission of non-profit “Kids Create
     Peace”:  to provide children and
     youth the understanding and skills to change conflict into opportunities for positive  outcomes, and
     to achieve academic proficiency.Kids Create Peace (KCP) is a program of One Voice of Peace, our 501 C-3 non-profit educational corporation registered in the states of Washington and California.  All donated funds go directly to supporting KCP and its operations.

Where does this happen?
Right now, it’s in Southern
California’s Coachella Valley.  Its pilot
year in 2011-2012, in one elementary school in Palms Springs, brought invitations
to four schools for the next year.  
This school year, KCP has been invited to six elementary schools , one Boys & Girls
     Club, and is adding one Middle School. 
     Principals of other schools are interested, but like most schools, they don’t (yet)
     have the funding.

Since
     its pilot year working with 5th graders, KCP has added 3rd,
     4th, and 6th grade.   

KCP’s future:    One Voice of Peace plans to take KCP  Valley-wide in two years, state-wide in three years and nation-wide in five.  
KCP’s magical methodology
Consistency: We’re with these students,
for one hour a week for 20 weeks, during or after the school day.  A variety of methods stir the students' interest:  discussion, journaling, video
clips, skits, students’ presentations, games, role-playing, and dyads – (where
the kids face one on one, often with someone they didn’t yet know very well, and speak
with honesty on a topic of importance to both.) And as one of our kids said, “It’s the first time I felt someone was
really listening to me” 
              With all these methods, the kids have
direct experience of the changes they can easily make:  in relationships, circumstances and
events.  This empowers them to bring what
they now understand, to all areas of their lives! 

We’ve learned from parents’ “before”
and “after” surveys that parents truly see the changes in their children’s
attitude and behavior – that increases harmony in their home-life (which is all
too often very stressful these days).
What we need – And what you receiveWe need your participation! 
We can’t do this by ourselves. 
This is a national cause: 
helping our young people become the best they can be, by starting early
in life, with the support they need and deserve.
As you may know, most schools have little or no money for these
“extra” programs.  This is why we are inviting
you to join us in raising money, so we can provide our KCP program free of cost
to the schools that lack funds for these programs.


What you’ll receive:

The realization that you are
     directly involved in changing lives – for the better!  

And you’ll also be able to sign up
     for a thank you gift from us – some of which are shown here – related to
     the size of your contribution. 


$5 -
$250 – Your name on list of supporters on OVP’s website


 $250
- $500 (Same as above) & Choice of any one gift


$500
& above – Combo totaling three items plus your name on
website list
(PLEASE CHECK PREFERENCES) 
                                   


Your contribution confirms you
     are part of KCP's  journey to become world-wide.

You’ll
be able to look back, as years pass, and know that you were part of getting One Voice of Peace, its programs and  benefits more widely known. Get on board and help make KCP reach children
and youth and their families nation-wide and in many other countries.  Imagine what it will be like to have people
everywhere able to resolve differences and disagreements, even conflict – into
peaceful, productive outcomes!  Isn’t
this one of our highest of human visions?                                                            

Indiegogo’s role in raising
money:
Given
the size of this vision, we are not asking for much money at this time.  Our goal now is $80,000 – enough to cover KCP's basic expenses for the upcoming school year.
Budget Highlights:
  KCP Program costs:  for
20 weeks, in 6 venues, each with 2 classes (units)  
  $6,712
each school  (or $3,356 per unit, e.g. 6th grade or B&G Club)  Cost covers:


3 Lead Facilitators, 3 Co-facilitators

Insurance                            



 Methodology:
Kids Create
Peace is a 20-week, one hour per week, after school session, and
explores how conflict begins:  the cultural assumptions and judgments that
cause separation, prejudice, and hostility.

The
     program introduces a set of concepts, to be understood and applied through
     experiential, “anchoring” activities, such as games, role-playing and
     short videos; written material, like songs, poetry, plays, speeches,
     quotes, and newspaper and magazine articles. These are chosen and
     used in ways that allow students to see how patterns of judgmental
     behavior and conditioned thinking create unwanted “drama”, trauma and
     stress in their lives – and in the lives of those around them.
Students
     learn the value of ‘journaling’ (recording their thoughts about class discussions
     and important things they can share with family members.)
We
     share a few moments of ‘mindfulness’ quiet time at the beginning of each
     session to ease stress, and set up a relaxed environment.
We
     demonstrate how easy it is to cooperate, appreciate each other (including our
     diversity), and to create together. Kids and youth directly experience
     the positive changes they can create in relationships, circumstances and
     events. Thus they experience themselves as peacemakers!

In summer seminars, school
breaks, etc., teachers and other educators are trained in the program’s ideas
and in use of its materials.  All are independently funded, therefore no
added expense for school systems.

</p><p>My name is Julia DeJesus, and I am a sociology major at Vanderbilt University.  I am currently studying abroad for the semester in Cape Town, South Africa, participating in a service-learning program. As part of this program I decided to volunteer at Ned Doman High School in Athlone, a small suburb of Cape Town. Ned Doman is extremely underprivileged but with the help of a very passionate principal, the school has improved vastly over the past few years.  One of the first things that the principal, Mr. Philander, mentioned to me was that he wanted to implement a garden on the campus in order to help the students understand that they deserve to be surrounded by beauty. </p>
<p>After conducting research on the positive impacts of plants in a workplace I have decided to take on the garden and addition of plants to the school as my Capstone project.  Some plants have already been placed in the courtyard but the addition of many more is still necessary, along with giving the students a place to sit within the garden.  <b>With your help and generosity I hope to add 4 picnic tables to the courtyard, giving more students a place to eat and hang out during interval, as well as more plants to fill in the garden.</b></p>
<p>Throughout the rest of my time here I will be measuring the levels of students’ self esteem as well as their view of themselves as learners.  In order to keep the garden groomed and in shape I will look for students with an interest in and willing to help while I am here and to continue to do so once I leave.  Along with these students, a government-run team placed in the school called Fusion is enthusiastic to take on the project and continue the cultivation of the garden after my departure.  <b>My hope is that the addition of plants and the beautification of the campus will improve not only the students’ academic focus but also their self-esteem.</b> </p>

The growth of this garden over the coming years has the ability to impact hundreds of students and with your generosity we have the chance to get it underway and “blossoming!”  Any contribution is greatly appreciated and would make a huge difference in the impact of this project and on the students’ lives.  
Regardless of whether you can contribute funds please share this link with family and friends to help get the word out!
Thank you so much for your support, the students of Ned Doman and I are extremely appreciative of your help in the launch of this project!!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Helping kids early can have the biggest impact later on in their lives.</h3>
<p></p>
<p>ADD and ADHD have a tremendous impact
throughout an individual’s life – on their education, income,
relationships, jobs, and within their communities. All ages of
individuals are impacted from as early as 4 years old throughout the
rest of their lives.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Between 2007 and 2009 CDC/NCHS found 8.4%/5.2 million children between 3-17 had as some point been diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.<br/><br/>""One study that included clinical assessment of children for ADHD symptoms (8) found that only one-half of children meeting the criteria for ADHD had received a diagnosis of ADHD or regular medication treatment""  Source CDC August 2011<br/></p>
<p>""Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common mental health disorders of childhood (1). The symptoms of ADHD (inattention, impulsive behavior, and hyperactivity) begin in childhood and often persist into adulthood. These symptoms frequently lead to functional impairment in academic, family, and social settings (2,3). The causes and risk factors for ADHD are unknown, but genetic factors likely play a role (4). Diagnosis of ADHD involves several steps, including a medical exam; a checklist for rating ADHD symptoms based on reports from parents, teachers, and sometimes the child; and an evaluation for coexisting conditions (5)."" <span class=""notranlsate"">
                Source CDC August 2011</span></p>
<p></p>
<p>Our goal is to help engage children
earlier and empower them through collaboration with family members,
educators, tutors, and health providers to have a bigger impact
earlier in their lives. This level of support is currently
managed in a face-to-face setting and is cost prohibitive. While
medication and professional testing is often  required to both
diagnose and manage the symptoms, we can reinforce and extend the
benefits by providing family members and care givers with more
efficient ways to recognize earlier indicators, share best
practices,and leverage tools and support mechanisms to help the child
going forward.</p>
<p>The services are available today but
can be very costly to procure and often require months of waiting to
schedule testing and meetings.</p>
<p>For those that are diagnosed, commonly
prescribed medication can cost up to $150 per month (with a co-pay)
for time-released doses. Cheaper versions of the medication are
available but require the child to take them multiple times a day.</p>
<p>But thousands of kids fall through the
cracks – kids that can be helped earlier in their lives.</p>
<p>Like many other challenges in our daily
lives new tools, services, and technology are helping to speed up
identification and management of various health issues and improve
outcomes. By engaging earlier with newer technologies, leveraging
services available in your home, making straight forward process
improvements and collaborating with thousands of other people in
similar situations, you and your child can live more fully.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Who We Are:</strong></p>
<p></p>
<p>Our team has spent the last seven years
developing a core web-based Health application framework that allows
our customers to collect data, analyze, collaborate, engage, coach,
create action plans, and then report and track outcomes. Since our
initial launch, thousands of organizations have interacted with our
platform, hundreds of thousands of individuals have been analyzed and
hundreds of millions of transactions have been processed.</p>
<p>Our team members have backgrounds in
Engineering, Data Analysis, Continuous Process Improvement systems
(i.e. Six Sigma, Lean), Behavioral Science and more than 15 years
developing web-based enterprise applications.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong></strong></p>
<p><b>Kids
Steps for (or 4) Life</b> is one of the first times
we are providing our platform directly to members. Usually  we embed
our platform within other corporate services in support of Corporate
Wellness Programs, Health Coaching and Bench-marking.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Why is this my personal passion?</strong><br/></p>
<p>This is a cause close to my heart, one
in which  I have a personal, vested interest.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<ol>
<li><p>My wife and I struggled with
	attention issues with our son and early in his life, we struggled
	for a couple years trying to figure out what was wrong, what to do
	about it, and how to manage the condition ongoing. We learned that
	early identification for less extreme cases of ADD is limited and
	reports show that it is even more difficult to detect in females.
	Schools have pulled back from any type of testing most likely due to
	budget constraints, professional resources and liability. Once you
	determine testing is needed, it is very expensive and you can wait
	months to schedule tests. Even for those that can afford it, years
	can go by during which time support could have occurred, and for
	those less fortunate, detection and treatment may not occur at all.</p></li>
<li>
<p>For me there is nothing more rewarding to me than working with kids and helping them.</p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">With this platform
	we could impact tens of thousands of kids, helping them
	and their parents. We could have a tremendous effect on
	kids’ lives and those around them in the long term.</span></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p></p>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>We have decided to participate in the Phillips Fellows program for two primary reasons</p>
<p></p>
<ol>
<li><p>To raise additional capital to
	implement our platform within this area. If we exceed our goal,  additional services will be added for all members, such as mobile
	integration, additional assessments, and interactive collaboration features.</p></li>
<li>
<p>This is the much bigger reason, to
	engage with a wide variety of potential members, families, and
	providers to collaborate, support and help increase the impact of
	our solution on kids’ lives.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>All capital raised through this
	campaign will be used in two phases</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Phase I – implement and launch
		the portal over the next four months</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Phase II – add additional
		services over the next six months. 
		</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Members will begin receiving limited
	access accounts right after the campaign has ended. 
	</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We want your help to quickly bring this
to production, period.</p>
<h3>What you get</h3>
<p></p>
<p>We have provided various perks for
different levels of contribution. 
</p>
<p>Lower levels are for our supporters and
those that would like to donate annual members to kids in need (or
you can provide as a gift for someone you know.)</p>
<p>We will work with other organizations
to provide the platform, for example, schools, teachers, tutors and
anyone that has (or knows) children that show early characteristics
and need family support.</p>
<p>One of the direct perks is that you
will receive an annual membership, giving you you access to all the
tools we currently have and will be adding each year. We will also
help provide sources of other local providers in direct support like
tutoring or testing facilities depending on the level of support
needed. 
</p>
<p>The highest level of perks are for our
provider level that they may be able to provide the service. In 2014
we will extend our service to integrate local providers to help
members that may need additional support, such as  coaching.</p>

individuals are impacted from as early as 4 years old throughout the
rest of their lives.

Between 2007 and 2009 CDC/NCHS found 8.4%/5.2 million children between 3-17 had as some point been diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.""One study that included clinical assessment of children for ADHD symptoms (8) found that only one-half of children meeting the criteria for ADHD had received a diagnosis of ADHD or regular medication treatment""  Source CDC August 2011
""Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common mental health disorders of childhood (1). The symptoms of ADHD (inattention, impulsive behavior, and hyperactivity) begin in childhood and often persist into adulthood. These symptoms frequently lead to functional impairment in academic, family, and social settings (2,3). The causes and risk factors for ADHD are unknown, but genetic factors likely play a role (4). Diagnosis of ADHD involves several steps, including a medical exam; a checklist for rating ADHD symptoms based on reports from parents, teachers, and sometimes the child; and an evaluation for coexisting conditions (5)."" 
                Source CDC August 2011

Our goal is to help engage children
earlier and empower them through collaboration with family members,
educators, tutors, and health providers to have a bigger impact
earlier in their lives. This level of support is currently
managed in a face-to-face setting and is cost prohibitive. While
medication and professional testing is often  required to both
diagnose and manage the symptoms, we can reinforce and extend the
benefits by providing family members and care givers with more
efficient ways to recognize earlier indicators, share best
practices,and leverage tools and support mechanisms to help the child
going forward.
The services are available today but
can be very costly to procure and often require months of waiting to
schedule testing and meetings.
For those that are diagnosed, commonly
prescribed medication can cost up to $150 per month (with a co-pay)
for time-released doses. Cheaper versions of the medication are
available but require the child to take them multiple times a day.
But thousands of kids fall through the
cracks – kids that can be helped earlier in their lives.
Like many other challenges in our daily
lives new tools, services, and technology are helping to speed up
identification and management of various health issues and improve
outcomes. By engaging earlier with newer technologies, leveraging
services available in your home, making straight forward process
improvements and collaborating with thousands of other people in
similar situations, you and your child can live more fully.
 
Who We Are:

Our team has spent the last seven years
developing a core web-based Health application framework that allows
our customers to collect data, analyze, collaborate, engage, coach,
create action plans, and then report and track outcomes. Since our
initial launch, thousands of organizations have interacted with our
platform, hundreds of thousands of individuals have been analyzed and
hundreds of millions of transactions have been processed.
Our team members have backgrounds in
Engineering, Data Analysis, Continuous Process Improvement systems
(i.e. Six Sigma, Lean), Behavioral Science and more than 15 years
developing web-based enterprise applications.


Kids
Steps for (or 4) Life is one of the first times
we are providing our platform directly to members. Usually  we embed
our platform within other corporate services in support of Corporate
Wellness Programs, Health Coaching and Bench-marking.

Why is this my personal passion?
This is a cause close to my heart, one
in which  I have a personal, vested interest.



My wife and I struggled with
	attention issues with our son and early in his life, we struggled
	for a couple years trying to figure out what was wrong, what to do
	about it, and how to manage the condition ongoing. We learned that
	early identification for less extreme cases of ADD is limited and
	reports show that it is even more difficult to detect in females.
	Schools have pulled back from any type of testing most likely due to
	budget constraints, professional resources and liability. Once you
	determine testing is needed, it is very expensive and you can wait
	months to schedule tests. Even for those that can afford it, years
	can go by during which time support could have occurred, and for
	those less fortunate, detection and treatment may not occur at all.

For me there is nothing more rewarding to me than working with kids and helping them.
With this platform
	we could impact tens of thousands of kids, helping them
	and their parents. We could have a tremendous effect on
	kids’ lives and those around them in the long term.



What We Need
We have decided to participate in the Phillips Fellows program for two primary reasons


To raise additional capital to
	implement our platform within this area. If we exceed our goal,  additional services will be added for all members, such as mobile
	integration, additional assessments, and interactive collaboration features.

This is the much bigger reason, to
	engage with a wide variety of potential members, families, and
	providers to collaborate, support and help increase the impact of
	our solution on kids’ lives.






All capital raised through this
	campaign will be used in two phases


Phase I – implement and launch
		the portal over the next four months


Phase II – add additional
		services over the next six months. 
		




Members will begin receiving limited
	access accounts right after the campaign has ended. 
	


We want your help to quickly bring this
to production, period.
What you get

We have provided various perks for
different levels of contribution. 

Lower levels are for our supporters and
those that would like to donate annual members to kids in need (or
you can provide as a gift for someone you know.)
We will work with other organizations
to provide the platform, for example, schools, teachers, tutors and
anyone that has (or knows) children that show early characteristics
and need family support.
One of the direct perks is that you
will receive an annual membership, giving you you access to all the
tools we currently have and will be adding each year. We will also
help provide sources of other local providers in direct support like
tutoring or testing facilities depending on the level of support
needed. 

The highest level of perks are for our
provider level that they may be able to provide the service. In 2014
we will extend our service to integrate local providers to help
members that may need additional support, such as  coaching.

Thanks to all our current and future
supporters



Building Blocks that we can use and will add additional specific modules.
Other Ways You Can Help
If you feel you could help more through other methods, let us know.
We are always looking for people to help get the word out, provide contacts with other health and service providers or other methods of funding.
Strategic partnerships will be key long term relationships to provide the most comprehensive range of services to our members.

<p>I moved
from Liberia to Sweden when I was 10 years old and unfortunately, due to the
long civil war in Liberia, I haven’t been back since then. This year I finally
had the opportunity to travel to Ghana and once again experience life in Africa
for one whole month on the countryside after 29 years of living in Sweden. While in Ghana
I also had the chance to hold a simple introduction lecture on the importance
of healthy eating for two schools in the village I was staying in. This brought
back many memories from my own childhood in Liberia and the idea of The Free Smoothie
Project started to take shape in my mind. </p>
<p>I have a professional
background as a web designer but my passion for health and wellness is moving me
more and more towards this area. I now frequently do free lectures and also
written an e-booklet on the importance of a healthy body and a strong
mind in the current age we are living in.</p>
<p></p><h3><b>This is where you come in</b></h3><p></p>
<p>The Free
School Smoothie Project is all about caring and sharing where there are needs
but no local economic support to match the needs. The project is about reaching
out to children and meeting some of their basic needs in a more exciting and
nourishing way, while also sharing simple ideas on health with them. The
project is also about reminding ourselves that all children, no matter of their
geographic location, are the main foundation of our future and in order for us to
create a bright and peaceful future, with healthy and intelligent minds, we
have to start nurturing and taking care of the rising seeds of that future.</p>
<p>After the introduction
lecture I held for the school children many of them expressed the need of fruits
in their daily school time but sadly
could not  afford it as fruits are more
expansive than the local starchy foods in the village. And as the starchy foods
are more affordable to many families, while it also last longer and give longer
stomach fullness than the fresh fruits, providing children with daily fresh
fruits are therefore looked at as an expensive luxury.</p>
<p></p><p></p><h3><b>Let’s make it happen</b></h3><p></p>
<p>I want to return
back to Ghana, visit the same village and the same local school where I held
the first introduction lecture and surprise them with your contribution and
love. I want to be in this village for a period of 3 to 6 months and share free
smoothies made of fresh local fruits with these school children. The plan is to
make smoothies for one class every school day, rotating the whole school during
the whole period of my stay, while also once a week sharing ideas on the
importance of good health with one school class at a time. The idea of making fruit
smoothies instead of just delivering a decorative fruit basket is to make fruit
eating even more exiting and exotic to the children, and also to encourage
spontaneous questions surrounding food and health. </p>
<p><b>Your help is needed</b><br/>I need your
heart and helping hand in order for this idea to become real and carried out.
Simply put, I need contribution from you to make my way back to Ghana, be able to
economically stay there for 3 to 6 months, get the equipments needed and have
the financial backup to actualize the project. </p>
<p>If the
financial goal of this project is not fully reached but still able to support at
least half the cost of the project, the project will still be carried out but
with adjustments - the smoothies will be changed to a daily fruit basket and
the duration of my stay will be half the time to minimize costs and increase
flexibility. </p>

<p>Contributors
will be able to follow the project primarily on the free online photo-sharing and
social networking service Instagram through photo imaging with simple comments.
Due to no fixed and reliable internet connection in the village, a Smartphone
with an Instagram app is more preferable here for simple photo sharing and simple
interactivities via the local online Smartphone service.</p>
<p><b>A little gift from me to you</b><br/>Contributors
will also receive my e-booklet on health – a 33 page PDF on how to make small
but vital changes to your health, changes your future self and future family will
be proud of and give thanks for. <br/></p><p></p><h3><b><b>Start sharing and help make a change</b></b></h3>

The 50 to 1 website. The website will host the video and more importantly will contain ALL the references for ALL the information contained in the video (see the link above for an example). Anyone who wants to fact-check or dispute the video will have open access to all our sources so they can see for themselves that the conclusions drawn in '50 to 1' are consistent with the science as understood by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.  For those who really want to go deep into the issue and wrap their head around the current state of climate economics the website will also host...<br/><br/>3. ... Expert Interviews. So far we have 7 confirmed interviewees, Former President Vaclav Klaus, Prof Henry Ergas, Prof Fred Singer, Anthony Watts, Prof David Evans, Christopher Essex, and Joanne Nova . Whilst excerpts of the interviews will be used in the 7 minute video, the real value is that we will be spending 30 minutes to 1 hour with each of them (so 3.5+ hours combined run time!) and the full interview with each of these internationally respected experts will be available on the 50-to-1 website as they share their thoughts and perspectives on climate change and in particular policy responses such as carbon taxes and trading schemes.<br/><br/>Each part of the 3 part structure is designed to work together, attracting people with the professionally produced, fun, funny and engaging 7 minute video, and then allowing them to fact check and explore on the website and discover for themselves through the interviews the true cost of 'stopping' climate change... which is 50 times more than adapting!<br/><br/>50 to 1 cuts across all the noise and fury surrounding the 'climate debate' and gets right to the point:  Even if the IPCC is right, and even if climate change IS happening and it IS caused by man, we are STILL better off adapting to it as it happens than we are trying to 'stop' it.  'Action' is 50 times more expensive than 'adaptation', and that's a conclusion which is derived directly from the IPCC's own predictions and formulae!<br/><br/>This video, website and interview combination is a game-changer and could radically shift the climate debate.  But it will only have an impact if a large number of people watch the video.  The video needs to be so fun, fast paced and visually engaging that people will not only watch it, but also pass it on for their friends to watch.  7 minutes is an ideal length because it's short enough to keep people's attention, whilst being long enough for us to pack in all the information required to understand the maths and economics behind 50 to 1.  It's effectively a short film which mixes the presentation of the maths and formulae with animations to illustrate every step along the way AND snippets of interviews with internationally respected experts lending the weight of their professional opinions to the subject.<br/><br/>President Vaclav Klaus, Professor Henry Ergas, Professor Fred Singer, Anthony Watts, Professor David Evans, Christopher Essex, and Joanne Nova have all agreed to be interviewed and we are still waiting to hear back from a few others.  Traveling with a production crew (to North America and Europe and back as well as around Australia) to get the interviews, as well as studio filming, editing, animating, colour grading and audio sweetening costs money.  That's why I need your help.<br/><br/>The 50 to 1 project has the potential to shift the climate debate for good.  It has the potential to undermine political attempts to impose more taxes, stupid subsidies and the myriad of 'green schemes' which we've seen spring up in the last decade or so.  It has the potential to save us all a small fortune in years to come if we can totally undermine public support for 'Action' on climate change and shift the focus instead to adaptation as required.<br/><br/>I've enlisted the help of an award winning production company here in Melbourne Australia to ensure the highest possible standard of production.  All up we've calculated a budget (including all the travel etc) of $155,000 to do everything properly, although we can scrape by with less if we cut a few corners, potentially as little as $130,000, but any less than that and it will start to cost us money rather than enable us to pay our bills!<br/><br/>Your donation will help us to reach our minimum budget and once we get there it will be 'game on' and we will be able to get cracking and make 50-to-1 a reality.<br/><br/>This project is being administrated by the Lord Monckton Foundation.  <a

'stop' climate change is 50 times more expensive than adapting to it?  And what if we could prove it using numbers and formulas accepted by the IPCC, CRU and other 'consensus' bodies?  Well that's exactly what 50-to-1 does.The original calculations were done by Lord Christopher Monckton who has since presented his conclusions to audiences of scientists, economists and mathematicians all over the world.  You can see the calculations and a FULL LIST OF SOURCES here: 50 to 1 calculations and sourcesLord Monckton has now approached me to take the above and present it in a video and web

as project coordinator, he is dedicated to securing access to treatment for
DNP+ members on daily basis. As an HIV activist, he has played critical role in
the organization by rigorously monitoring stocks of HIV drugs in Delhi; he also
played a crucial role in reporting logistical bottlenecks to the
publicly-administered AIDS program, thus ensuring uninterrupted supplies of drugs
and diagnostics for HIV treatment in Delhi. <div>

<p>However, his health has started to fail. Paul has been

the last stage before the onset of liver cirrhosis. In addition to impacting
his quality of life, his condition is affecting his working capacity. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Treatment with new hepatitis C
medicines (direct acting antivirals – DAAs) will preserve liver function and
health, while lack of treatment risks vital damage. A fixed combination of 2
DAAs (Sofosbuvir + Ledipasvir) offers a cure, but at a substantial cost. For
Paul, six months of treatment with the
combination obtained through a special name patient import
process will cost 3390 USD that is equivalent to his one year’s salary.
With three children, a wife and an ailing father to support, the exorbitant
cost means this drug is simply priced out of his reach. </p>

And that people don’t respond to stories of the sad truth of others’ lives anymore. They said we would all rather just hear of only the happy parts of our existence. Would you agree? Have we grown so insensitive, please tell me you have not lost the capacity for respect, humanity, and honest work. This is our story.After seeing how the Cambodian women live, Olivera Djokovic made the decision to remain in Cambodia after traveling here to visit her son. She was introduced to Love Nicholson who also came to Cambodia to learn of what the people here must endure. They quickly joined forces because it seemed the right thing to do.Art solution has some big plans for the future; among other things, an employment plan as part of training in the design studio, which we intend to open. We recognize the need for corporate social responsibility by investing in human resources that have been largely ignored. “If we give only material assistance, we are only supporting a system that produces victims”. ""Vision of proposed studio""Art Solution is a company that has 15 years of experience in decorative gift wrapping, decorating weddings, and other festivities; quality balloons and invitations for all events. This we want to do and in Cambodia, to train and employ women who are marginalized because we believe that work is a requirement for independence and the continuation of life worthy of all. Employment for women has therapeutic significance of the return of confidence, self-esteem and re-establish control over their lives. This will help not only women and girls but also their families. For women who want to be educated and to work independently to open a design studio.

Get Ready to Learn (GRTL) is a 15-20 minute sensory-motor yoga curriculum for students regardless of age or ability as developed by Anne Buckley-Reen, OTR, RYT in 2008.   Anne and a group of highly trained clinicians are volunteering their time and expertise to the students at the Amrit Center for Special Needs in Coimbatore India, http://www.amrit-ifsn.com/home.html, and we need your support to make this possible. Pediatric expert occupational therapist and registered yoga teacher, Anne Buckley Reen has been working with children for over thirty years.  Through her intensive training wih Sonia Sumar (developer of Yoga for the Special Child,http://www.specialyoga.org/) she developed this curriculum based yoga therapy program that focuses on creating an environment that is conducive for learning. This is done through use of therapeutic protocols to facilitate optimal level of attention, performance, behavior, and communication; and providing staff with strategies to optimize developmental, academic, and social outcomes.
GRTL is currently implemented in over 500 classrooms in New York City District 75 schools throughout the five boroughs as well as classrooms in Arizona, California, Connenctlicut, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, New Hampshire, New Jersey, Vermont, and London, England.

<p>This past year I have been blessed with the opportunity to be a part of a medical sciences class at the Bollman Technical Education Center, where they teach you about specific careers and all of the materials that go along with the career of choice. Each class at BTEC is a part of a larger organization (much like DECA) and medical sciences is a part of HOSA, Health Occupations Students of America. HOSA has two competitions each year, one on the state level and one on the national level. Nationals is costly and I would more than love to be able to go this summer.</p>
<h3>How do you get to Nationals?</h3>
<p>Nationals is a two step process that is simple yet very challenging. Like any national competition you have to medal gold silver or bronze at the state level, but in oder to make it to state you must take a written test and make the top 10 percent of all the test takers. </p>
<h3>What did I make Nationals for?</h3>
<p>My Biomedical Debate team and I placed 2nd in the state and have ultamitely decided that we want to represent the state of Colorado in the upcoming national competiions. :) Biomedical Debate is exactly as it sounds, we have a medically related debate topic that we had to research in preparation for the tournement. The topic this year is the effects of social media on health, and though it was challenging, we managed to take second, being just shy of first. </p>
<h3>Where is Nationals?</h3>
<p>Walt Disney's Disney World in Orlando Florida. Cool right? I have never actually been to Disney World so I was shocked to see the prices of basically everything there. I would love to go for the first time in 17 years, but man is it expensive. </p>
<h3>How I came across this sight</h3>
<p>I actually have no idea what I'm doing :) this sight is completely new to me and I have absolutely no idea how this works. A friend of mine in a class had overheard me mention how expensive nationals is and suggested for me to join this sight... so here I am. </p>
<h3>Additional information about me</h3>
<p>Just in case you were wondering why I'm taking a medical sciences class, my dream since the 7th grade was to become a verterinarian, and I wanted to learn more and more about health care. Not only did my teacher (former CNA) teach me about the field in general but she helped open my eyes to the world of health care and all of the careers in it. Now not only do I still have interest in becoming a verterinatian, but now I also have interest in becoming a general care physician. Decisions decisions.</p></div>","What is this campaign for?

Research shows that if you get the early years right, people go on to be positive contributors in society. Get it wrong and people will have learning problems in the future.<br/><br/>The first 5 years are more important than K-12 and University combined, yet early education is one of the most neglected, over regulated and misunderstood fields in most countries throughout the world. Worse still, if you're a new parent, you're expected to know everything about child development when your first child is born.<br/><br/>Did you know that something simple and innocent like encouraging a child to walk too soon can have a long term consequence on their development? Is there a problem with a child who talks late? That child may go on to be a great speaker. Every child learns differently. What matters is receiving a rich set of experiences that help encourage brain development.<br/><br/>Yes, you could read a thousand books on child development. However, do these books address the unique requirements of your child at the right time? And who has the time to read, interpret and decide what is appropriate?<br/><br/>As parents, we all need to accept that most of us have no idea what we're doing.... until now.<br/><br/><br/><strong>What is Critical Years?</strong><br/><br/>Critical Years is an expert system and monitoring tool. It helps develop and capture the uniqueness of every child.<br/><br/>As you might imagine, you can't put a 6 month old baby in front of a computer and expect them to do a multiple choice exam. Instead, you can create a real world environment with objects and experiences that encourage certain types of behaviour. Once you see a behaviour, you record it.<br/><br/>Critical Years learns from your observations. Then it suggests new experiences to encourage further development. Each set of experiences are unique and adjusted to the requirements of each child. We have included over 4,000+ experiences and 3,000+ resources based on academic research from across the world.<br/><br/>In addition to learning and development, Critical Years provides you with the ability to journal your child's learning experiences with written and photographic evidence, and communicate with other family members, early education professionals or other professionals such as speech therapists, etc. about your child.<br/><br/><br/><strong>Privacy and Security</strong><br/><br/>What about the sensitive nature of child information?

<p>If you are a parent, an education professional or anyone interested in the potential of every young person, then you should pledge what you can!</p></div>","Critical Years is an education platform that helps parents and early childhood professionals with the brain development of children.BackgroundThe first 5 years of brain development are the most critical in every persons life. Research shows that if you get the early years right, people go on to be positive contributors in society. Get it wrong and people will have learning problems in the future.The first 5 years are more important than K-12 and University combined, yet early education is one of the most neglected, over regulated and misunderstood fields in most countries throughout the world. Worse still, if you're a new parent, you're expected to know everything about child development when your first child is born.Did you know that something simple and innocent like encouraging a child to walk too soon can have a long term consequence on their development? Is there a problem with a child who talks late? That child may go on to be a great speaker. Every child learns differently. What matters is receiving a rich set of experiences that help encourage brain development.Yes, you could read a thousand books on child development. However, do these books address the unique requirements of your child at the right time? And who has the time to read, interpret and decide what is appropriate?As parents, we all need to accept that most of us have no idea what we're doing.... until now.What is Critical Years?Critical Years is an expert system and monitoring tool. It helps develop and capture the uniqueness of every child.As you might imagine, you can't put a 6 month old baby in front of a computer and expect them to do a multiple choice exam. Instead, you can create a real world environment with objects and experiences that encourage certain types of behaviour. Once you see a behaviour, you record it.Critical Years learns from your observations. Then it suggests new experiences to encourage further development. Each set of experiences are unique and adjusted to the requirements of each child. We have included over 4,000+ experiences and 3,000+ resources based on academic research from across the world.In addition to learning and development, Critical Years provides you with the ability to journal your child's learning experiences with written and photographic evidence, and communicate with other family members, early education professionals or other professionals such as speech therapists, etc. about your child.Privacy and SecurityWhat about the sensitive nature of child information? We can't put video, photographic or written content on services like YouTube, Facebook, Google+, Amazon Web Services, etc. for obvious privacy and security reasons. We had to develop our own in-house secure storage services for content. All information is tranferred over SSL/https - similar to banks.Who can use Critical Years?Critical Years can be used by parents, long day care services, family/home care services, pre-schools, kindergartens, out of school care, etc. It can also be used by related interested people such as family members and specialists in other fields (doctors, psychologists, speech therapists, etc.)Our GoalHelp us bring Critical Years to the USA and the rest of the world.Until now, the project has been entirely self funded.

<h2>OVERVIEW</h2>
<p>My name is Jillian, I am at 22 year old nurse from Ontario, Canada and on May 30th I will be travelling to Nairobi, Kenya to volunteer at an orphanage for a month.  I have done a lot of research into my trip and have developed a project called We Are One (W.O.A) who's main focus is to integrate education into orphanages. I found out that orphans are the last to receive education, and usually are not granted the ability to go to to school so my goal is to integrate one to two hours of education daily into the orphanage I am placed at. Self esteem building and language skills (reading, writing spelling) will be my biggest focuses as well as world issues and mathematics. We are so fortunate in North America and often take education for granted. Unfortunatley supplies and resources are scarce and any initiatives I want to take are all my own money. I need school supplies, teaching supplies, snacks and lesson plans all of which will cost money, as well my volunteer trip is already costing 3000$. I hope that you guys appreciate my cause and this is a way you can give to a cause without actually having to travel there.</p>
<h2>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h2>
</div>
<div>
<h3>To break it down for you here are my costs:</h3>
<p>My cost are based on my travel expense and the supplies I hope to purchase for my We Are One project...these are supplies that are desperatley needed</p>
<p>My Flight from Canada to Kenya-$1600</p>
<p>My Visa- $100</p>
<p>Vaccinations-$400</p>
<p>Medical Insurance-$150</p>
<p>I will be staying with a Kenyan family to experience their way of life</p>
<p>Living Expenses-$700...If any of you would like proof of this you can contact my volunteer co-ordinator I would be happy to provide you with her info, also visit volunteerhq.org to see what I will be doing!</p>
<p>I need to purchase some clothing, shoes, many school supplies (including pens, paper, pencils, craft work, art supplies, books. sports equipment), teaching supplies such as white boards, chalk etc. My hope is to purchase most of these items in Nairobi as this money will actually go back into the Kenyan economy to help.</p>
<p>My estimate for all of this is approximately <strong>$1500-$2000</strong> as these orphanages have NOTHING towards supplies for teaching!</p>
<p>- I really hope to implement self confidence in these kids. Losing their parents and families to violence and HIV/AIDS will have left a serious scar to these children, and having a mental health background in nursing I hope to put my counselling and coping skills to use. I also want to help with language skills including, reading, writing and spelling English is one of the national languages in Kenya (along with Swahili) however schools and orphanages are so short staffed and have such a lack of resources that children often never learn to read or write. Finally I want to get their input as to what they would like to learn and get them excited about learning and teaching each other. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>The Impact</h2>
<p>You contributions will make more difference than you can imaginel Picture if it was you abandoned and left as orphan, wouldn't you want to still be treated with respect and get the same education as other children? I know you may think it's too far to even have to care, but take a look at where you live what if it happened there? You need to know that every dollar and intention to help will be used to its greatest ability. I will make sure I do my best to show you all how your donations have helped. I have worked hard to save a good chunk for this trip, however I need the help getting the rest. I am not just going to follow a program and say I went and made a difference, I have put a lot of work and thought into this project and I hope you can see the change we can make. Ghandi once said ""You must be the change you want to see in the world"". I think I will leave it at that, and thank you for taking the time to view my cause!</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>Other Ways You Can Help</h2>
<p>If you cannot donate just spread the word about W.A.O to your friends your family, anyone who is looking to help. I know spreading the word will create awareness and even if I do not reach my goal if I can get even a few people informed about these children I have made a differencel I will do the best I can with what I have, but know that your 50 cents, your five or your twenty dollars can make a kid feel special, even for a dayl Thank you!</p>

Burma is home to one of the world’s longest-ruling military dictatorships and the world’s longest-running civil war. Education is limited, the media is controlled and many young people – refugees, migrants, students – flee through the jungles to Thailand’s border towns, seeking a better life.
Their chances are poor. Working and sleeping in factories, farms and shops, or living in the numerous refugee camps, they have little chance to improve themselves and they quickly lose their confidence and hopes.

The Young Generation’s Note...
In mid-2011 a small group of us young migrants on the Thai-Burma border wanted to change things for the better. So we began making a monthly magazine, full of content created by and for migrants and refugees – news, stories, articles, poems, photography, cartoons and more.

every month we distribute the magazine to refugee camps, factories and migrant schools
we bring news to divided families
we share inspiring stories and experiences
we publish the writing of refugees and migrants, giving them a voice
and we try to strengthen the fractured Burmese community
You can read the magazine's March 2012 issue here (15mb).
We need your help!
Please help us to improve the futures of young Burmese migrants and their communities! We need your support to help our project become financially sustainable!
