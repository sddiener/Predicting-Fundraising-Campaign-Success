VoltBot has three modes:
1. Charger mode (Voltage Controlled by Charging Protocol). VoltBot will simulate a quick charger to charge phones and USB devices.
2. DC Power Supply mode (Constant Voltage). VoltBot will output the user assigned voltage.
3. Current Source mode (Constant Current). Both current & voltage is limited. VoltBot will ramp up the voltage slowly to match the current to the limited current and damp down the voltage quickly if the current is beyond the limit.
The current mode suits to board debugging, Li+ battery charging and LED testing.

USB ports are mature and can be converted into various output forms.
The Dual-Screw converter enables VoltBot to be used like common SMPS.
The USB to DC5.5 cable enables VoltBot to be used as a common adapter.
The Banana Jacks converter and Banana Kit enable VoltBot to be used like common laboratory DC power supply.

</div></div>","Fast charge every device you have no matter which fast-charging protocols you need -- PD3.0 (with Programmable Power Supply), Apple 2.4A, Samsung Adaptive Fast Charge, Huawei SuperCharge/ FCP/ MediaTek Pump Express, Qualcomm Quick Charge 2.0 / 3.0 ...
 
 
 

                            
 
With 3 ports, you only need 1 outlet and 1 charger to charge all your devices together. Eliminating the struggle with finding enough outlets to charge your devices.
 
 

Works with all USB-A & USB-C devices/laptops under 65W power rating. If your laptop uses non Type-C power adapters, all you need is a converter cable and it’ll charge just as well.

Good news is, whether you own a USB-C laptop or non USB-C laptop, we provide the cables as well. For USB-C's, you can get Charby Edge (our USB-C to C 100W 2m/6.5ft cable); for non USB-C's, our USB-C to laptop tip converter cable, which you can specify via the Backer Form.Both are available via the USB-C cable perk and the add-on cable perks.
 
 

 
 
 



15 different laptop tips to choose from. There's about 1 for every laptop manufacturer out there. (More details in converter cable's specs further below). If you doubt we have the right type for yours, ask us at team@charbycharge.com.
 
 
 


 
No matter the devices -- laptops, smartphones, game consoles, camera, or headphones -- Charby Pico charges them all.
 
 



 
Charby Pico comes in either the U.S. (usable in Japan and China) or EU native plug. We'll give you a free UK/AU outlet converter for each Pico depending on your shipping country. Regardless, it's usable in every country as it supports universal 100 - 240V voltage suitable for all outlets.
*EU plug version is now only available in Gold Edition.
 


   
Charby Pico is not only small and light, but its prong is also foldable.
 
 



You can use up all 3 ports when all your devices’ batteries are running low. It’s 2019, you should be able to keep your multiple devices running without having anxiety about it.

 
 


Using the successor to silicon (Gallium Nitride), we can provide everyone with an advanced power adapter that’s much smaller and power efficient. Not to mention generates far less heat too.
 
 


 
For you who used to carry the brick we called laptop adapter around, enjoy a charger that feels almost like nothing in your bag and of course -- the abundant of available space.
 

 
 

 
 

 
Charby Pico will not only take away your mess and travel burden, but also your worry for safety. And should your Charby Pico shows any sign of defect within the warranty period, you will get a replacement with zero extra fee on your part. We will take care of everything.

 
 

 
Get Free Nylon Hard Case(s) to store your wall charger and cables when you:


 add-on a Charby Pico with the perk ""Add-on special"" before checking out.
 get 4 free cases with the standard perk ""Early Bird Bundle"".

Note: add-on perks can be found below the ""Checkout"" button after selecting any perk.
 




 


Can't find the right one for your laptop? Send your laptop's original adapter's maximum power output (W) and a photo of the laptop tip to team@charbycharge.com, and we'll tell which laptop tip you should pick in the Backer Form.

Due to  its format, the main perpetrators of many of the Internet's problems, i.e., the governments and corporations, are getting representation in IGF that they don’t deserve. Given these circumstances, we decided to take initiative to defend the Internet as we know it and to create a parallel space to raise the voices of civil society initiatives, activists and common people. Our Guests
AMELIA ANDERSDOTTERSwedish activist, member of the European Parliament from 2011-2014 for the Piratpartiet.BIRGITTA JÓNSDÓTTIRActivist, writer, poet and member of the Parliament of Iceland for the Pirate Party in Iceland.FABIANE BOGDANOVICZIntersectional feminist, activist for Animal Rights, works with Solidarity Economy and former General Secretary of the Pirate Party in Brazil.JULIA REDAGerman, member of the European Parliament for the Pirate Party in Germany and Vice President of the Greens / Europe Free Alliance.   What We Need  Our main focus on this crowdfunding is:
 infrastructure for live streaming and remote worldwide participation

We also intend to use up leftover money to organize a hackathon and make a documentary film. All expenses will be published transparently on our site.
    Internet Ungovernance Forum The most vital problems today are censorship and freedom of speech; surveillance and privacy; excessive commercialization and super-monopolies; protective, prohibitionist and conservative governance approaches; awful governance examples as in the case of Brasil and the list goes on. Further, we do not see any of these problems independent of the greater political, social and economic contexts in which the Internet and related digital infrastructures are embedded in. 	We want to reclaim the Internet as a fundamental infrastructure of our societies, cities, education, health, work, media, communications, culture and everyday activities. 
Joins Us
We call on our participants to resist seeing the problems of the Internet as only technological and void of its materiality.",4.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h4>About Tutudesk Campaign</h4>
<div>
<p></p>
<p><span>Aspirus is proud to partner with <a href=""www.tutudesk.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Tutudesk</a>. Conceived by Archbishop Desmond Tutu, a Tutudesk provides a comfortable surface to read and write on, and is designed to be portable for kids to take home for homework.</span></p>
<p>Modern technology has advanced to the point of smart desks like Aspirus. But for children who lack any desk at all, learning to read and write functionally is almost impossible - they have to write on the floor or use a classmate’s back. Sub-Saharan Africa has a shortage of 95 million school desks.</p>
<p>The Tutudesk is made from polymer, and offers a school desk that is sustainable, portable, low cost and effective. Over 5 years, a Tutudesk costs less than $0.02 per school day while providing an essential platform supporting literacy.</p>
<p>1.3 million Tutudesks have been deployed in more than 3,000 schools across Africa, with a goal of 20 million Tutudesks to 20 million children by 2020.</p>Help change these children’s prospects forever.</div>

<h4>STEP 3: Check whether your monitor can be mounted</h4>
Aspirus follows the VESA industry standard - these are ""hole patterns"" at the back of monitor displays for mounting purposes. Many monitors are VESA compliant, but some are not. <span style=""background-color: initial;"">Look for 4 mounting holes on the back of your monitor and check that they fit the 75x75mm or 100x100mm hole pattern in the diagram below. This is sometimes hidden under the monitor stand. Or, check your monitor manual or contact us at hello@aspirus.co (with your monitor model number). </span><span style=""background-color: initial;"">For iMacs, refer to the FAQ and for non-VESA monitors, you can use the Laptop/Monitor platform. </span>

Sitting all day is bad for our health - excessive sitting is linked with obesity, heart problems, diabetes and some cancers. And traditional standing desks are ineffective, because when we get busy, we forget to stand. 
Aspirus is a revolutionary smart standing workstation that fits on your existing desk. Press one button and it rises to your height, sitting or standing. Turn on the app to set sit-stand goals and reminders. Track your real-time data and keep yourself motivated. 
Improve your health, reduce back pain and stay in shape. With one simple step.





















""Aspirus might be the most technological standing desk yet"" Tech.Co



""... what really distinguishes the Aspirus from other desks is the inclusion of a small sensor array that communicates with your smartphone via Bluetooth"" Gizmag



""...its unique selling point is the fact that it can be paired with a smartphone to allow you to set goals and reminders. This allows you to stay on top of how long you've been sitting or standing, and change up your position accordingly"" Trend Hunter


""...The rig tracks how long you have been sitting there and uses a handy notification light in the shape of the Aspirus logo to let you know it’s time to stand up. It can also tell when you’re not at your desk, so it tracks your sitting/standing time more accurately... Effectively, the app helps turn the workstation into a kind of life coach for your workplace behavior."" Tech In Asia


""The Aspirus smart workstation can save you a trip to the chiropractor"" e27



""Aspirus is a smart standing workstation that is automated, customisable and offers healthcare motivation."" The Straits Times



Experts have recommended we stand for at least 2 hours a day - and work our way towards 4. But sitting is unavoidable, especially at work. Aspirus eases you into a healthier routine - without requiring you to change a beat. 

















Aspirus is a sleek and smart adjustable workstation packed with features you'd expect in standing desks costing $2000 or more.  



With Aspirus, moving between sitting and standing couldn't be easier. Press one button and it automatically elevates to your pre-set height, sitting or standing. 



Use the Aspirus app to set daily stand goals, sit-stand reminders, and personalise Aspirus to your height. Get real-time reports with sit-stand data, trends, progress report, and more. Make Aspirus your personal health coach in the workplace.



We all know it's really important to move during our workday. But the reality is that we spend 77% of our time at work sitting. So we made it extremely easy for you to know when it's time to move - just heed the gentle glow of the Aspirus icon. 





Aspirus uses an innovative multi-sensor technology to accurately track when you are sitting or standing in front of the desk and excludes the time you are away. Stay motivated with real-time data, every single day. 



You need your laptop and phone within close reach. That's why we've included a sleek metal laptop and phone stand with every Aspirus. Cradle your favourite hardware in this efficient stand and free up space on your workspace.



Aspirus was designed for ergonomics. Every Aspirus comes with independent monitor screen adjustment. Adjust it once at set up, and always achieve the correct posture, sitting or standing. Back pain be gone. 


Aspirus provides the ultimate flexibility. It can be used on top of any table or bay window. And with modular mounts, switch between laptop, monitor or dual-monitors configurations, without ever changing your base unit.  



We all know how it feels to be interrupted when you are trying to meet a deadline. Aspirus has a built-in do-not-disturb light that you can turn on to indicate that you are busy and turn it off when you are available. Now let's get some real work done.  








Explore Aspirus from any angle with this 3D Interactive Model.



These users have just experienced Aspirus. Here's what they have to say.





Aspirus combines the flexibility of workstations with the intelligence of smart standing desks. Get ready to meet the workspace of the 21st century.

About Tutudesk Campaign


Aspirus is proud to partner with Tutudesk. Conceived by Archbishop Desmond Tutu, a Tutudesk provides a comfortable surface to read and write on, and is designed to be portable for kids to take home for homework.
Modern technology has advanced to the point of smart desks like Aspirus. But for children who lack any desk at all, learning to read and write functionally is almost impossible - they have to write on the floor or use a classmate’s back. Sub-Saharan Africa has a shortage of 95 million school desks.
The Tutudesk is made from polymer, and offers a school desk that is sustainable, portable, low cost and effective. Over 5 years, a Tutudesk costs less than $0.02 per school day while providing an essential platform supporting literacy.
1.3 million Tutudesks have been deployed in more than 3,000 schools across Africa, with a goal of 20 million Tutudesks to 20 million children by 2020.Help change these children’s prospects forever.

<p></p></div>","Touch typing for the blind
For every contribution you make, we’ll donate a license of the Super Braille Keyboard to a blind person on your behalf.
An invisible innovative keyboard which for the first time enables touch typing and Braille typing on the touch screen itself!One touch screen technology, two solutions:
1. Innovative single-handed touch typing
for both sighted and visually impaired users.
2. 
Standard two-handed
Braille typing for the visually impaired.
What
would happen if you couldn't see your tablet or smartphone screen? 
According to the World Health Organization there
are 285 million visually impaired people worldwide. They cannot type freely on
touch screen devices and are challenged by this every day. 
They cannot see the screen nor can they feel the
touch screen keyboard in the same way as they can feel a regular physical
keyboard.                               Braille keyboards cost about $2000Third party Braille keyboards cost about $2,000, and even though they can work with tablets and smartphones they are quite cumbersome and unwieldly. Plus, as soon as you need to add a large piece of equipment to get a mobile device to work, then the tablet or smartphone loses much of its mobility and convenience. The UpSense Super Braille Keyboard obviates the need for any extra equipment making mobile devices just as mobile for everyone, whether sighted or visually impaired.Inpris is led by a father and son team who passionately
believe that the opportunities and convenience offered by smart devices should
be available to all. We have developed the Braille of the 21st century
– the UpSense virtual keyboard. 
UpSense is also great for the sightedThis is the keyboard of the future – an invisible touch screen
keyboard based on intuitive finger gestures. 
So you don’t have to see to type, you just have to feel the
touch screen. 
Creating the futureWe
have been working very hard for the last two years and we now have a very
robust Beta version of the UpSense Super Keyboard. We have given it to many people
for testing and with their insights and feedback  we are close to releasing the commercial versions
of the UpSense Super Keyboard and UpSense Super 
Braille Keyboard. Up until
now we have been in bootstrap mode, investing only our own personal savings supplemented by a small grant for startups
from the Israeli Ministry of Economy. We now turn to you and ask for your
generous support to bring the future of touch screen typing to the world of
touch screen apps.
We are planning two products: 
1. 
UpSense Super Keyboard for single-handed
gesture typing
2. 
UpSense Super Braille Keyboard for typing standard
Braille with two hands

How do I type
with UpSense?
Testimonials
""Up until now we were forced to use large and unwieldy machines that took up a lot of space at home, but now we can use a lightweight device that is really convenient to use."" – S. H.""I had the opportunity to use the the Super Braille Keyboard and I had a very moving and positive experience."" – T. G.""There is no doubt that this is one of the most amazing developments of all time for the visually impaired community."" – D. M.
Your Impact How our technology is validated
We have been busy – here’s a summary of our accomplishments:
 Over the past year we have tested
and retested version after version of the UpSense Super Keyboard. Each
iteration improved on the previous version, as we used testers from many
different backgrounds.


We completed the Hebrew University’s Siftech accelerator program – a four
month course for technology startups. In summer 2013 Inpris was selected as one
of only eight startups from all over the world for Google’s exciting and
prestigious two-week Blackbox program. 
In August 2013 we had the privilege of demonstrating UpSense to
Mr Shimon Peres, the president of the State of Israel, at Google Israel’s R&D headquarters. He said: ""This will be a tremendous help to millions of
people who until now had no alternative. It’s a brilliant idea."" ""Tnufa"" grant from the Israeli Ministry of EconomyThe TeamInpris
was founded by  father and son,
Ben-Etzion and Nissan Yaron. We believe in making the world of touch screens
accessible to all, regardless of ability. Together we have created the UpSense Super
Keyboard.
Inpris
was founded in 2011 in Israel, the startup capital of the world, and we have
been developing the UpSense technology for more than two years. 
We
are not afraid to take risks in order to create superior products that function
exactly the way you need them.
Nissan
(son) is our CEO. He is a professional filmmaker, former head of the Jerusalem
Art Students Association and former head of a special intelligence unit in the
Israeli Army.
Ben-Etzion
(father) is our CTO. He is an experienced innovator and winner of the Kaye award
for innovation for a solution to the Y2K bug. Currently Ben-Etzion is Team

<p></p>
<div>ZERO+ has openwrt linux, python and our own light-weight virtual machine gemini  pre-installed to reduce the need to translate coding language from platform to platform. You only need to write in Lisp on cloud to seamlessly connect different interfaces of different devices through gemini virtual machine. No need to translate languages between platform! The Lisp interpreter is designed by our team. The interpreter runs both at Zero+ and Zero+ cloud service.You can define the execution logic both in Cloud and in HW(Zero+) by writing code in Zero+ Web IDE. By using customized Lisp language, you can set breakpoints then run your code step by step and even define your own program syntax.</div>

<h3>Zero+ interesting points summary</h3>
<p>These tips can help you to understand Zero+ a little more.</p>
<p>1. Use Lisp(It's more like human language, commonly used in the field of artificial intelligence), you can define program syntax and form your <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px;"">own unique language. (This point makes Zero+ so Geek!)</span></p>
<p>2. The Zero+ WebIDE provides some debug methods, such like debug print, breakpoint, single-step execution, <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px;"">view code, view variable data.</span></p>
<p>3. No need compile, no need flash, no need reboot. The Lisp interpreter designed by SmartMatrix team runs both at Zero+ and Zero+ Cloud <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px;"">service.You can define the execution logic both in Cloud and in Zero+ by writing code in Zero+ Web IDE. Here the execution logic in </span><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px;"">Cloud means the Zero+ platform leverages the computing power of the Cloud.

Cloud (on the way)
Powerful cloud service: Cloud Storage, Web IDE, IFTTT rules. 
How does it workWhen you have an idea in mind, you will only need our ZERO+ and the sensor you needed to have everything ready. then you can code on WEB-IDE to  achieve  whatever  interaction you wanted with your own devices.Supported sensor: 640P webcam, temperture and humidity sensor, light sensor, LED lights, gyroscope, TFT and OLED screen, PM 2.5 air quality detector, infrared module and microphone, arduino module supported via extension.
EASY DEVELOPMENT WITH ZERO+

ZERO+ has openwrt linux, python and our own light-weight virtual machine gemini  pre-installed to reduce the need to translate coding language from platform to platform. You only need to write in Lisp on cloud to seamlessly connect different interfaces of different devices through gemini virtual machine. No need to translate languages between platform! The Lisp interpreter is designed by our team. The interpreter runs both at Zero+ and Zero+ cloud service.You can define the execution logic both in Cloud and in HW(Zero+) by writing code in Zero+ Web IDE. By using customized Lisp language, you can set breakpoints then run your code step by step and even define your own program syntax.

Web IDE






Example code:
(dev.gpio 0 ""out"" 1)gemini DSL(domain-specific languages) or Natural language programmingDefinition conversion ;normal : (dev.gpio 0 ""out"" 1)Chinese : (管脚 1 输出 1)Janpanes: (ピン 1 出力 1)Korean:(핀 1 출력 1) 


1. Access HW interface in Zero+:
   Output high level to GPIO0     (dev.gpio 0 ""out"" 1)   Configue UART:     (define com (dev.uart ""/dev/ttyS0"" 9600)     Write data ""Zero+"" to UART     (dev.uart.write com ""Zero+"")     Read 5 data from UART     (dev.uart.read com 5)
2. Toggle LED in accordance with current time:
   LED is connected to GPIO11.   (define LED_On (lambda ()(dev.gpio 11 ""out"" 1)))   (define LED_Off (lambda ()(dev.gpio 11 ""out"" 0)))   (define CurrentTime?            (lambda ()(int (time.strftime ""%H"" (time.localtime (time.time)))))   )    (define Night?           (lambda ()                    (and                            (> ( CurrentTime? ) 16) (< ( CurrentTime? ) 23)                   )           )   )   (if (Night?) (LED_On) (LED_Off))
3. Control the LED On/Off from the webpage:      
   LED is connected to GPIO0.<html><head><script type=""text/javascript"">function LED_ON(){  var ws = new WebSocket(""ws://Zero+ Cloud Service ws link"");  ws.onopen= function(event){        document.getElementById(""message001"").innerHTML = ""Client is listening!"";        ws.send('(@devcall ""your Zero+ Device ID"" (dev.gpio 0 ""out"" 1) (lambda (x) x ))')        ws.onmessage= function(event){           document.getElementById(""message001"").innerHTML += ""Message from server:""+event.data;        };        ws.onclose= function(event){        //close socket        };  };}function LED_OFF(){  var ws = new WebSocket(""ws://Zero+ Cloud Service ws link"");  ws.onopen= function(event){        document.getElementById(""message001"").innerHTML = ""Client is listening!"";        ws.send('(@devcall ""your Zero+ Device ID"" (dev.gpio 0 ""out"" 0) (lambda (x) x ))')        ws.onmessage= function(event){           document.getElementById(""message001"").innerHTML += ""Message from server:""+event.data;        };        ws.onclose= function(event){        //close socket        };  };}</script></head><body><button onclick=LED_ON()>LED_ON</button><button onclick=LED_OFF()>LED_OFF</button><div id=""message001"" >...</div></body></html>
4. Air Cleaner equiped with Zero+:





5. Electronic Lock equiped with Zero+:




6. Espruino Web Console via Zero+:
   Connect Zero+ and Espruino by UART interface. You can program your Espruino from anywhere in the world by web browser.

Zero+ interesting points summary
These tips can help you to understand Zero+ a little more.
1. Use Lisp(It's more like human language, commonly used in the field of artificial intelligence), you can define program syntax and form your own unique language. (This point makes Zero+ so Geek!)
2. The Zero+ WebIDE provides some debug methods, such like debug print, breakpoint, single-step execution, view code, view variable data.
3. No need compile, no need flash, no need reboot. The Lisp interpreter designed by SmartMatrix team runs both at Zero+ and Zero+ Cloud service.You can define the execution logic both in Cloud and in Zero+ by writing code in Zero+ Web IDE. Here the execution logic in Cloud means the Zero+ platform leverages the computing power of the Cloud. This point is not like other IOT platforms, most of them just only provide storage and push service.
4. Connect Zero+ to the internet, open the WebIDE, you can program and debug your Zero+ from anywhere in the world.

An european startup based in Barcelona and Brussels who is working with the purpose that you can throw your wallet to the bin.
We are convinced that is time to put all your cards and tickets in one smart App.

Make it happen
We believe a lot in us and we are pretty sure than Klotilde is a very Smart, Complete, Simple and Pragmatic App.
Unfortunally, that's not enough...
We have not the potencial of big corporations as Google, Apple, Microsoft or Yahoo.
We have not enough money to launch a significant campaign to compete with them or other partial solutions. 
Indeed, this could be compared like the history between David and Goliat. 
This is the reason we have created an Indiegogo campaign. We need funds for our marketing campaign and for launch our App, and we'd need all your support to get it.
Please, help us to success. Make it happen.
With your support we are totally convinced that we can transform Klotilde in a very nice sucessful history.
Thanks a lot in advance and welcome to Klotilde.
The New Smart Revolution

I love you. You are what I’ve always wanted.
You have it all. There is no other like you.
Two days ago, the access to the concert, yesterday in the gym, this morning paying in the stores and later in the restaurant.
This afternoon the tickets in the cinema and this evening the discounts in the fast-food.
Of course, I can not forget what you have done in the ATM.
By the way, I’ve already returned the books to the library and thank you very much for remind me that I have to go to the dentist next Tuesday.
Will you come? True?
I wait you in the subway entrance. You pay ;-)

Visit us at www.cloopband.comCloop XL lets you stay organized so you can quickly retrieve the cable you need. We all have busy lives so don't waste it untangling.We have listened to our previous backers and have created  Cloop XL with new and improved features designed especially for larger cables.So what’s new about Cloop XL? Cloop® is easy, convenient and fast! Save time, get organized and stay on-the-go!                         CLOOP XL - New elegant design for those larger cablesHate having to wrap Velcro around too many times?

 We have carefully designed  Cloop XL to offer you more capabilities to tackle your larger cables. We have given  Cloop XL an elegant and more powerful closure mechanism with stronger Neodymium magnets. This, together with a high-quality silicone that is more elastic, will allow  Cloop XL to fit many cable profiles. The silicone material makes Cloop safe, durable and very resistant to frequent use. Also, the silicone will not stain your cables.  The magnets are embedded to avoid scratching your other accessories and to prevent them from coming out. Nonetheless, this doesn’t prevent you from attachingCloop to your bag, clothes or anchoring it to a metallic surface.The cable passage keeps your Cloop attached at all times so you don't have to worry about losing it. It also facilitates easier cable wrapping.  Patent PendingCloop XL uses strong neodymium magnets and a new closure design. See below, it holds up to 4.9 lbs (2.2 kg) weight before opening.We have done numerous prototypes and testing using our own 3D printed molds to optimize the new Cloop XL design.Cloop XL’s new design is not only elegant but also includes detailed features optimal for its purpose. Our earliest priority date for our U.S. nonprovisional patent application (14/611,254) is February 10th, 2014. And our invention was conceived of even before that priority date. We also have a PCT international patent application (PCT/US16/12538).Cloop XL is the perfect organization companion for your bathroom accessories!CLOOP XL for your hair dryerCLOOP XL for your hair ironCLOOP XL & bathroom drawerCloop XL Tackles Those Power Cords Cloop XL for Mac's power cordsCLOOP XL for your extension cordCLOOP XL - Elastic so you can wrap around twice when needed We didn’t forget about  Cloop XL’s younger siblings.

</div>
<div>ColorSeek app is developed by Designcraft.hu, a small graphic design and webdesign studio in Hungary, with 15 years experience in graphic design and web development.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>We like to take pictures on the go, and if we need some inspiration later, we use the pictures to get interesting colors and graphic design ideas.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>To collect colors and color harmonies is always a good chance for a designer who wants fresh ideas for new projects. Take your Android smartphone and go hunting for beautiful color harmonies of nature, or find pleasing color schemes in cities, in your home, at the office or anywhere instead of using the boring ""factory preset"" colors found in graphic design programs.</div>

<div> </div>
<div>The smartphone is always with us, so it seemed a good idea to create an app for color collecting and editing in one place:</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>take pictures</strong> of interesting colors</li>
<li>
<strong>load existing pictures</strong> to ColorSeek</li>
<li>
<strong>create color palette</strong> from these pictures</li>
<li>you can pick one color and <strong>create a color scheme</strong> from that (the app automatically add harmonies: analogous, complementaries, triads, tetrads etc.)</li>
<li>
<strong>edit and save</strong> the palette for later use (to SD card, or cloud storage)</li>
<li>
<strong>share your palettes</strong> (on ColorSeek website, Facebook, Twitter or Flickr) with your friends or colleagues</li>
<li>
<strong>export</strong> the swatches to ASE (Adobe Swatch Exchange) format</li>
</ul>
<p>By <strong>exporting</strong> <strong>to ASE (Adobe Swatch Exchange) file format,</strong> you can import the swatches to popular graphic design programs (Photoshop, Illustrator, Fireworks, etc.).</p>

<p>The app supports devices (smartphones and tablets) with a camera, an SD card for saving palettes and Android OS 2.3.3 to the latest Android 4.2.</p>

</div></div>","ColorSeek app is developed by Designcraft.hu, a small graphic design and webdesign studio in Hungary, with 15 years experience in graphic design and web development.
 
We like to take pictures on the go, and if we need some inspiration later, we use the pictures to get interesting colors and graphic design ideas.
 
To collect colors and color harmonies is always a good chance for a designer who wants fresh ideas for new projects. Take your Android smartphone and go hunting for beautiful color harmonies of nature, or find pleasing color schemes in cities, in your home, at the office or anywhere instead of using the boring ""factory preset"" colors found in graphic design programs.
 

 
The smartphone is always with us, so it seemed a good idea to create an app for color collecting and editing in one place:



take pictures of interesting colors

load existing pictures to ColorSeek

create color palette from these pictures
you can pick one color and create a color scheme from that (the app automatically add harmonies: analogous, complementaries, triads, tetrads etc.)

edit and save the palette for later use (to SD card, or cloud storage)

share your palettes (on ColorSeek website, Facebook, Twitter or Flickr) with your friends or colleagues

export the swatches to ASE (Adobe Swatch Exchange) format

By exporting to ASE (Adobe Swatch Exchange) file format, you can import the swatches to popular graphic design programs (Photoshop, Illustrator, Fireworks, etc.).


 
 
 

 
The ColorSeek app is a must-have if you are search for inspiration and you are


a graphic designer
a webdesigner
an architect
an interior designer
a filmmaker
a visual artist (illustrator, painter, sculptor)
a fashion designer
a product designer
a fan of beautiful colors! :)

 
 

The app supports devices (smartphones and tablets) with a camera, an SD card for saving palettes and Android OS 2.3.3 to the latest Android 4.2.
The precision of color rendering will depend on your hardware in your device. You will be able to improve the color fidelity by manualy adjusting the exposure, and the white balance before you take the shot.
You will be able to make some corrections on the palette too after it is saved.
 


 
We spent many hours on brainstorming, designing the app screens, and we have already made a functional version of the app.
 
Since we are a small design studio, we need your support to finish our product, and release it to the Creatives.
 
The money should cover the following fields:


finishing the app
testing the app thoroughly
building a decent homepage for the app
makeing and execute a marketing plan
releasing the app for the public

Roughly we need $2000 for it.

The app will be released in two versions: free and PRO. The free version will be limited: you can try the app features, but for example you can't save or share the palettes. The PRO version will offer the full feature set, and the price will depend on how much fund we collect.
 
If we reach $2000 the PRO app's price will be lower, and the app will be done for the deadline.
 

If we reach $5000 we made an iOS version too! In this case every supporter ($50 or more) and sponsor ($100 or more) will be able to get the iOS version too! (This will be available at the end of 2013.)
 
If we do not reach $2000 than all the money raised until the end of the campaign will go to the development of the ColorSeek App. In this case, the development will be slower, and the PRO version will cost higher.
 
 
 



 
You will get the following for your perks:
 

$1: Thank you for your support!


1x ColorSeek PRO App for Android


 
 

$10: You will receive our color schemer app when it will be available.

<p><b>Where can I use the Sonim XP7 Extreme?</b></p>
<p>The Sonim XP7 Extreme can go anywhere you can go, and handle anything you can handle.  If your activities are hard on you, if you’re hard on your equipment, if you've ever broken phones, or feared for the safety of your delicate phone, the Sonim XP7 Extreme is the Android LTE Smartphone for you.</p>
<p><b>Does the Sonim XP7 Extreme need a case?</b></p>
<p>The Sonim XP7 Extreme has no need for a protective case. It is the world’s most ruggedized smartphone available on the market today.  </p>
<p><b>What are some of the use cases for the XP7 Extreme for the active sports crowd?</b></p>
<p>We expect that the XP7 Extreme will be either a second phone for Active Sports participants, or a primary Android phone for those who work and play in the outdoors, and need a smartphone as rugged as they are.</p>
<p><b>Is this an unlocked phone? </b><b>Yes.</b> The Sonim XP7 Extreme is an Unlocked smartphone that works on any GSM/3G/4G LTE carrier around the world---this means that you don’t need a contract for the  phone, and can use the XP7 Extreme with any compatible carrier and switch anytime.  <br/></p>
<p><b>What is the trial service from Ultra Mobile?</b></p>
<p>We’ve included a Trial Service period (US Customers Only) of mobile service:  The XP7 Extreme ships activated with a SIM (Subscriber Identity Module) and Trial Service from Ultra Mobile.  This means your first month’s service is compliments of Ultra Mobile, and includes Unlimited Nationwide &amp; International Talk, Unlimited Global Text, Unlimited Data (1st GB at 4G LTE speed) and $10 of international call credit.</p>
<p><b>What happens after my first month’s credit expires?</b></p>
<p>Once the balance included for the Trial Service has been depleted, you will need to refill the balance with Ultra Mobile, or switch to service from a compatible carrier. This means that you need to take the phone to a compatible operator, and to sign up for service to have a SIM (Subscriber Identity Module) installed.  Sonim supplies a tool and detailed instruction for safe installation of a SIM card into the XP7.</p>
<b>Is this compatible with my existing cell phone carrier?</b><p><b>Maybe. </b>The Sonim XP7 Extreme is compatible with any North American GSM/HSPA/LTE operator.  This includes noted operators such as AT&amp;T Wireless, and T-Mobile, and the new and improved Metro PCS, or Canadian operators like Bell Mobility or Telus, as well as Mobile Virtual Network Operators such as Ultra, H20 Wireless, StraightTalk, Net 10 and others.  </p>
<p><i><b>***This Sonim XP7 Extreme model is NOT compatible with CDMA/LTE operators such as Sprint or Verizon Wireless.***</b></i></p>
<b>What if I’m a Verizon or Sprint subscriber? Can I use the Sonim XP7 Extreme with them?</b><br/><p><span>If you’re a current <b>Verizon Wireless</b> and <b>Sprint Customers</b> your <b>Sonim XP7 Extreme</b> will ship with the <b>Ultra Mobile Trial Service</b> detailed above.  Following your trial service, we highly recommend that you continue service with Ultra Mobile. Your phone is unlocked, so if you choose to continue to use Ultra Mobile, you are all set, or you can choose any other compatible wireless operator.</span></p>
<p><b>What happens if my Sonim XP7 Extreme Gets Damaged?</b></p>
<p>We don’t think it will, but if it does Sonim provides an industry leading 3-Year Comprehensive Warranty:  This includes Accidental Breakage. See <a href=""http://www.sonimtech.com/corporate/warranty.php"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here</a> for detailed terms and conditions.</p>
<p><b>What makes Sonim the right company to bring this type of smartphone to this market segment?</b></p>
<p>Sonim Technologies has been making virtually indestructible cell phones for nine years. These are the military grade ruggedized phones built and used by the toughest professionals on the planet from firefighters, policemen, construction workers, to the military and more.</p>
<p><b>Why are you selling the Sonim XP7 Extreme to consumers?</b></p>
<p>The Sonim XP7 Extreme is the introduction into the consumer market for people that work hard, but play harder, and need a phone that can keep up. We believe it’s time for a change. If you are a person that works and plays in the outdoors, then the Sonim XP7 Extreme may be the first phone that matches your toughness, and will be your only phone.  </p>
<p><b>How is it different than the XP7 currently offered in Canada by Telus and Bell?</b></p>
<p>The XP7 Extreme edition is the active sports variation of the XP7 currently being offered.  The housing is all black, versus the industrial black/yellow motif of the commercial/industrial edition. Additionally, we plan to offer preloaded apps targeted to the Active Sports users, and with some models, sports specific accessories.</p>
<p><b>Who will like the Sonim XP7 Extreme?</b></p>
<p>If you’re a person that spends your weekdays in an office, but spends your weekends on the slopes, on the mountains, in the desert, on the road, at the beach, or in the water...then the Sonim XP7 will be the right smartphone and the the right tool for your second life...where you really live.</p>
<p><b>Why will this be my second phone?</b></p>
<p>People today love their smartphones. They are an indispensable tool for our work lives, our family lives, and our play lives. But today’s smartphones are expensive and delicate, and simply not the right tool for outdoor activities. How many times have we dropped our cell phone from our pocket and been frozen with fear as it falls a mere 3 feet to the ground? How can we expect phones like that to endure extreme use for those of us who live our lives outside the office and when we are off of the couch?</p>
<p><b>What apps and accessories make this a viable choice for the active sports crowd?</b></p>
<p>We are working with a number of companies whose outdoor related applications will be pre-loaded prior to shipment of your XP7 Extreme. We will update details as campaign evolves.  </p>
<p>We expect other apps may be evaluated and added during the course of the campaign, as companies discover the campaign and the value of the Sonim XP7 Extreme.</p>
<p><b>Does the Sonim XP7 Extreme really have a 3-year warranty?</b></p>
<p>The Sonim XP7 includes an industry leading three-year comprehensive warranty---including Accidental Breakage. See <a href=""http://www.sonimtech.com/corporate/warranty.php"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here</a> for detailed terms and conditions.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>What type of SIM card does the Sonim XP7 Extreme use?</b></p>
<p>The Sonim XP7 uses a Micro SIM card slot.</p>

Sonim Technologies has been making virtually indestructible cell phones for years. Military grade rugged phones built and used by the toughest professionals on the planet from firefighters, policemen, construction workers, to first responders and more. The Sonim XP7 is the introduction into the consumer market for people like you that work hard, but play harder, and need a phone that can keep up.



Where can I use the Sonim XP7 Extreme?
The Sonim XP7 Extreme can go anywhere you can go, and handle anything you can handle.  If your activities are hard on you, if you’re hard on your equipment, if you've ever broken phones, or feared for the safety of your delicate phone, the Sonim XP7 Extreme is the Android LTE Smartphone for you.
Does the Sonim XP7 Extreme need a case?
The Sonim XP7 Extreme has no need for a protective case. It is the world’s most ruggedized smartphone available on the market today.  
What are some of the use cases for the XP7 Extreme for the active sports crowd?
We expect that the XP7 Extreme will be either a second phone for Active Sports participants, or a primary Android phone for those who work and play in the outdoors, and need a smartphone as rugged as they are.
Is this an unlocked phone? Yes. The Sonim XP7 Extreme is an Unlocked smartphone that works on any GSM/3G/4G LTE carrier around the world---this means that you don’t need a contract for the  phone, and can use the XP7 Extreme with any compatible carrier and switch anytime.  
What is the trial service from Ultra Mobile?
We’ve included a Trial Service period (US Customers Only) of mobile service:  The XP7 Extreme ships activated with a SIM (Subscriber Identity Module) and Trial Service from Ultra Mobile.  This means your first month’s service is compliments of Ultra Mobile, and includes Unlimited Nationwide & International Talk, Unlimited Global Text, Unlimited Data (1st GB at 4G LTE speed) and $10 of international call credit.
What happens after my first month’s credit expires?
Once the balance included for the Trial Service has been depleted, you will need to refill the balance with Ultra Mobile, or switch to service from a compatible carrier. This means that you need to take the phone to a compatible operator, and to sign up for service to have a SIM (Subscriber Identity Module) installed.  Sonim supplies a tool and detailed instruction for safe installation of a SIM card into the XP7.
Is this compatible with my existing cell phone carrier?Maybe. The Sonim XP7 Extreme is compatible with any North American GSM/HSPA/LTE operator.  This includes noted operators such as AT&T Wireless, and T-Mobile, and the new and improved Metro PCS, or Canadian operators like Bell Mobility or Telus, as well as Mobile Virtual Network Operators such as Ultra, H20 Wireless, StraightTalk, Net 10 and others.  
***This Sonim XP7 Extreme model is NOT compatible with CDMA/LTE operators such as Sprint or Verizon Wireless.***
What if I’m a Verizon or Sprint subscriber? Can I use the Sonim XP7 Extreme with them?If you’re a current Verizon Wireless and Sprint Customers your Sonim XP7 Extreme will ship with the Ultra Mobile Trial Service detailed above.  Following your trial service, we highly recommend that you continue service with Ultra Mobile. Your phone is unlocked, so if you choose to continue to use Ultra Mobile, you are all set, or you can choose any other compatible wireless operator.
What happens if my Sonim XP7 Extreme Gets Damaged?
We don’t think it will, but if it does Sonim provides an industry leading 3-Year Comprehensive Warranty:  This includes Accidental Breakage. See here for detailed terms and conditions.
What makes Sonim the right company to bring this type of smartphone to this market segment?
Sonim Technologies has been making virtually indestructible cell phones for nine years. These are the military grade ruggedized phones built and used by the toughest professionals on the planet from firefighters, policemen, construction workers, to the military and more.
Why are you selling the Sonim XP7 Extreme to consumers?
The Sonim XP7 Extreme is the introduction into the consumer market for people that work hard, but play harder, and need a phone that can keep up. We believe it’s time for a change. If you are a person that works and plays in the outdoors, then the Sonim XP7 Extreme may be the first phone that matches your toughness, and will be your only phone.  
How is it different than the XP7 currently offered in Canada by Telus and Bell?
The XP7 Extreme edition is the active sports variation of the XP7 currently being offered.  The housing is all black, versus the industrial black/yellow motif of the commercial/industrial edition. Additionally, we plan to offer preloaded apps targeted to the Active Sports users, and with some models, sports specific accessories.
Who will like the Sonim XP7 Extreme?
If you’re a person that spends your weekdays in an office, but spends your weekends on the slopes, on the mountains, in the desert, on the road, at the beach, or in the water...then the Sonim XP7 will be the right smartphone and the the right tool for your second life...where you really live.
Why will this be my second phone?
People today love their smartphones. They are an indispensable tool for our work lives, our family lives, and our play lives. But today’s smartphones are expensive and delicate, and simply not the right tool for outdoor activities. How many times have we dropped our cell phone from our pocket and been frozen with fear as it falls a mere 3 feet to the ground? How can we expect phones like that to endure extreme use for those of us who live our lives outside the office and when we are off of the couch?
What apps and accessories make this a viable choice for the active sports crowd?
We are working with a number of companies whose outdoor related applications will be pre-loaded prior to shipment of your XP7 Extreme. We will update details as campaign evolves.  
We expect other apps may be evaluated and added during the course of the campaign, as companies discover the campaign and the value of the Sonim XP7 Extreme.
Does the Sonim XP7 Extreme really have a 3-year warranty?
The Sonim XP7 includes an industry leading three-year comprehensive warranty---including Accidental Breakage. See here for detailed terms and conditions.

What type of SIM card does the Sonim XP7 Extreme use?
The Sonim XP7 uses a Micro SIM card slot.",19.0,2,"2 Campaigns

<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;font-weight: normal;"">An estimated 414 fatalities, 10,275 non-fatal
injuries, and 78,392 crashes occurred </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">ANNUALLY</span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;font-weight: normal;""> in the US due to flat tires or blowouts before tire pressure monitoring
systems were installed in vehicles (ref. </span><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">NHTSA. (2003, June). “FMVSS No. 139, New Pneumatic Tires for Light Vehicles”, Docket No.
NHTSA-2003-15400-2).</span>
</li></ul>
<ul><li><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">If the tire remained under-inflated by 1 psi over its lifetime, its tread life would decrease by about 800 miles / 1280 km (ref. NHTSA Docket No. NHTSA-2000-8572-26).</span></li></ul>
<ul><li><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">NCSA tire pressure survey indicate that 26% of passenger cars had at least one tire that was under-inflated by at least 25% (approx. 6.8 psi under inflation)  Thus, on average, these passenger cars could lose about 5,440 miles / 8,704 km of tread life due to under-inflation, if their tires were under-inflated to that extent throughout the life of the tires (ref. NHTSA Docket No. NHTSA 2000-8572).</span></li></ul>
<ul><li><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Recent data provided by Goodyear indicate that fuel efficiency is reduced by 1% for every 2.96 psi of under-inflation (ref. NHTSA Docket No. NHTSA-2000-8572-26). Therefore, a typical 25 percent under-inflated tire would increase fuel consumption by approximately 2.3%. Hence with proper inflated tires, it would translate into a saving of approximately US$11 billion in the US alone (using 2013 data from US Energy Information Administration).</span></li></ul>

Operational pressure range: 0 to 600 kPa (0 to 87 psi)

Operational temperature range: -40 to 85°C 
Tire sensor battery life: up to 2 years (at 25°C rated temperature)
Water & Dust resistant: IP57

  You together with FOBO Tire and FOBO Bike can change the following statistics:-



An estimated 414 fatalities, 10,275 non-fatal
injuries, and 78,392 crashes occurred ANNUALLY in the US due to flat tires or blowouts before tire pressure monitoring
systems were installed in vehicles (ref. NHTSA. (2003, June). “FMVSS No. 139, New Pneumatic Tires for Light Vehicles”, Docket No.
NHTSA-2003-15400-2).

If the tire remained under-inflated by 1 psi over its lifetime, its tread life would decrease by about 800 miles / 1280 km (ref. NHTSA Docket No. NHTSA-2000-8572-26).
NCSA tire pressure survey indicate that 26% of passenger cars had at least one tire that was under-inflated by at least 25% (approx. 6.8 psi under inflation)  Thus, on average, these passenger cars could lose about 5,440 miles / 8,704 km of tread life due to under-inflation, if their tires were under-inflated to that extent throughout the life of the tires (ref. NHTSA Docket No. NHTSA 2000-8572).
Recent data provided by Goodyear indicate that fuel efficiency is reduced by 1% for every 2.96 psi of under-inflation (ref. NHTSA Docket No. NHTSA-2000-8572-26). Therefore, a typical 25 percent under-inflated tire would increase fuel consumption by approximately 2.3%. Hence with proper inflated tires, it would translate into a saving of approximately US$11 billion in the US alone (using 2013 data from US Energy Information Administration).



UPDATE 2: Stretched Goal of $250,000!!!

We have good news. We are now introducing a stretched goal of $250,000. Upon hitting this goal, we will throw in one additional set of caps in another color for the tire sensors that is worth $3 per piece (so that you will have both the silver caps and black caps which are interchangeable for your tire sensors). This will be given free to all contributors (including those of you who have contributed earlier). You will not need to worry about choosing the color of your tire sensors for your order. Please help to spread this news for us to achieve our stretched goal.


Risks & Challenges

We have overcome all the technical challenges especially quality and reliability aspects. FOBO Tire is currently ready for mass production. FOBO Bike is currently under development.




The remaining challenge is to get market support to make FOBO Tire a success...
FOBO Tire starting delivery date remains unchanged which is in November 2014 even with the introduction of FOBO Bike.
FOBO Bike is being developed now as we speak and estimated delivery date is in March 2015. We estimate production tooling and final testing for FOBO Bike to be completed by January 2015.

<p></p>
<p><b>Q: What phone do I need to have to take BiiSafe Buddy into use?</b><br/>A: There is both an iOS and an Android version available. BiiSafe Buddy works with i<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Phone 4S, iPhone5 and iPhone 5S/5C as well as w</span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">ith Android 4.3 or higher version in devices equipped with Bluetooth 4.0. </span></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""><b>Q: Is there a Windows phone version available?</b><br/>A: Currently Windows lacks the support for Bluetooth 4.0. We are considering developing the Windows version in the future when the support is available in Windows.</span></p>
<p><b>Q: Will the product have any warranty?</b><br/>A: All BiiSafe Buddies come with one year warranty. </p>
<p><b>Q: Does the BiiSafe Buddy break if it accidentally drops on the floor?</b><br/>A: No. BiiSafe Buddy is made of high quality durable materials that don't break easily. It has a solid metal rim and backplate.</p>
<p><b>Q: Is BiiSafe Buddy compatible with tablets?</b><br/>A: Yes. It will work with all the iPad models, except iPad 1 &amp; 2, which do not have Bluetooth 4.0. We have tested it also with Nexus 7. It should also work with all the Android tablets running Android 4.3 or higher and having Bluetooth 4.0.</p>
<p><b>Q: Can I run the BiiSafe Buddy application without the actual Buddy?</b><br/>A: Yes. You can login to your account and make checkins from the virtual Buddy on the screen as well receive messages and alerts with devices running iOS7 or Android  4.1.</p>
<p><b>Q: Do I need to purchase a BiiSafe Buddy to everyone in the family in order to be connected?</b><br/>A: All family members need to have the BiiSafe Buddy mobile app. It is free. Only those members, who send location updates or alerts, need to carry a BiiSafe Buddy with them. For example if a child is expected to “check-in” regularly, he/she carries the BiiSafe Buddy. Parents or other family members will receive messages and updates on their phones, but do not need to have a BiiSafe Buddy on them.</p>
<p><b>Q: What do I do when the battery runs out?</b><br/>A: BiiSafe Buddy has a long battery life time, 3-12 months depending on the usage. It uses a standard CR2032 battery that is inexpensive and widely available. The battery is easy to change yourself as the package will contain a backplate opener for battery changing.</p>

Project timeline

BiiSafe Buddy development path 

We need your support to finalize the product and bring it to the market. We are ready to start mass production in January 2014. Shipping will start in February 2014.










Risks and challenges



We are currently well on track. We have also paid much attention when selecting partners that we can trust to deliver on time and that are geographically close to ensure smooth operations. 

Q&A

Q: What phone do I need to have to take BiiSafe Buddy into use?A: There is both an iOS and an Android version available. BiiSafe Buddy works with iPhone 4S, iPhone5 and iPhone 5S/5C as well as with Android 4.3 or higher version in devices equipped with Bluetooth 4.0. 
Q: Is there a Windows phone version available?A: Currently Windows lacks the support for Bluetooth 4.0. We are considering developing the Windows version in the future when the support is available in Windows.
Q: Will the product have any warranty?A: All BiiSafe Buddies come with one year warranty. 
Q: Does the BiiSafe Buddy break if it accidentally drops on the floor?A: No. BiiSafe Buddy is made of high quality durable materials that don't break easily. It has a solid metal rim and backplate.
Q: Is BiiSafe Buddy compatible with tablets?A: Yes. It will work with all the iPad models, except iPad 1 & 2, which do not have Bluetooth 4.0. We have tested it also with Nexus 7. It should also work with all the Android tablets running Android 4.3 or higher and having Bluetooth 4.0.
Q: Can I run the BiiSafe Buddy application without the actual Buddy?A: Yes. You can login to your account and make checkins from the virtual Buddy on the screen as well receive messages and alerts with devices running iOS7 or Android  4.1.
Q: Do I need to purchase a BiiSafe Buddy to everyone in the family in order to be connected?A: All family members need to have the BiiSafe Buddy mobile app. It is free. Only those members, who send location updates or alerts, need to carry a BiiSafe Buddy with them. For example if a child is expected to “check-in” regularly, he/she carries the BiiSafe Buddy. Parents or other family members will receive messages and updates on their phones, but do not need to have a BiiSafe Buddy on them.
Q: What do I do when the battery runs out?A: BiiSafe Buddy has a long battery life time, 3-12 months depending on the usage. It uses a standard CR2032 battery that is inexpensive and widely available. The battery is easy to change yourself as the package will contain a backplate opener for battery changing.

<h3>About Impact Gel</h3>
<p>The Impact Gel office and manufacturing facility is located in Ettrick, Wisconsin. Although we are a relatively small company in size, we always think about the big picture and new, innovative ways to use Impact Gel. We are working on developing many types of products using environmentally-friendly gel made from soybean oil. Along with phone cases, Impact Gel's products include saddle pads, equine leg care, shoe insoles, sticky pads for your vehicle dashboard, and motorcycle seat savers. </p>

<p></p>
<h4>Gel Technology</h4>
<p></p>
<p>Impact Gel is a natural based green product derived from soy and other natural oils. The manufacturing process requires no application of temperature or pressure change. The gel is polymerized into one long, loosely cross-linked, flexible molecule that is folded back on it self many times. These sections can easily slide past each other but still remain connected thereby absorbing and dissipating unprecedented amounts of kinetic energy. Our gel is all natural, sustainable and environmentally-safe. Impact Gel's patents cover a wide range of mixtures that enable us to tailor the product's physical properties to match requirements. This opens up numerous opportunities for our gel application.</p>

Keep in touch with other people without giving your phone number.
""A number for all the occasions""
Sbizzy is the disposable number suitable for your needs, both for your private life and for your business. This number will be yours until you want. Do you need more than one number, maybe two or three? Do you need a disposable email as well? With Sbizzy everything is possible, and it is also easy! Soon it will become an App, ready to keep your privacy safe in time of need.

Who talks about us?

Why should I use Sbizzy?

How many times you wanted to publish an ad online or on a newspaper and you did not want to leave your number because you were afraid of being called by a call centre? Now you can avoid it with a disposable Sbizzy number.

Are you tired of your job? Do you want to look for a new one without letting your boss know? With Sbizzy it is also possible to set your account and know which ad they are calling you from. Just select your privacy level so as to be called showing the associated Sbizzy number.

Do you want to get to know new people, have new adventures? Or maybe even meet your soul mate? Why not! Not always everything works as planned. Often we have to deal with insistent people, stalkers and dangerous situations. Sbizzy will keep your life confidential, without sharing your personal data with strangers.
How does it work?

When you register for the first time a Sbizzy number will be created and will be linked to your number. Each Sbizzy number has its own call list, customizable voice mail and the possibility to record incoming calls. Together with the number a disposable email will be given. Sbizzy numbers expire after 30 days, but if you want it is possible to renew them. It is also possible to delete Sbizzy before the expiring date.

Alternative Email


In addition to the phone number, Sbizzy will let you link your email to a new Sbizzy email address. This new address is associated by default to your new Sbizzy number. In this way your inbox won’t be exposed to the spam.
Why is Sbizzy different?

Firstly, Sbizzy is very flexible because it allows the users recharge their number with Sbizzy credits, this system can satisfy all kinds of necessities. Secondly, a temporary email will be created; it can be used instead of your personal address in order to keep a higher level of privacy. In addition it is possible to activate the “do not disturb” mode and add a customizable voice mail. It is also possible to record the calls and download the mp3 file later.

Thanks to you Sbizzy will grow and become the best App for all the people who want to keep their life - and their contacts – private. Become one of our supporters!

<p>More than ever before, it has become common for people to carry and use more than one device throughout the day. Most people now have a laptop and a smartphone, spreading their tasks across these devices, using each one for different things: social media on their phones and work on their laptops. This is a wonderful part of our lives in the digital area, but it also brings about a new set of problems, problems that we never needed to face before. Namely – how do you keep both of these devices charged and safe?</p>
<p>Until now, it has been been tough to answer this question, forcing people to purchase multiple accessories and add-ons to do everything that they need to do.</p>
<p><br/>All-in-One Power</p>
<p>Our solution is called LapZap, and it is going to set a new standard for laptop cases and wireless chargers. Instead of splitting these functions into multiple products, we have created an all-in-one, comprehensive case that features a wireless charger built-in. This means you can protect your laptop and carry it around wherever you go, all the while charging your smartphone. Forget about second-rate chargers and over-priced cases: this case does it all, saving you money and keeping you on the move.</p>
<p><br/>Innovative Design &amp; Sturdy Craftsmanship</p>
<p>LapZap draws power directly from your laptop's internal battery so that you do not need to worry about charging it up before you head out for the day. You can transport your laptop confidently and efficiently, knowing that whenever your smartphone starts to run low, you can let it ""borrow"" a little juice from your laptop. While this is already a popular concept for smartphone chargers, there is no such laptop case/wireless charging combo on the market yet. We have obtained a patent for our innovative design, and we are going to follow through on it properly, adhering to world-class craftsmanship standards.</p>
<p><br/>No Extras Needed</p>
<p>Although we have priced LapZap affordably, we also think that it is important to keep the ongoing costs low, which is why there are no extras needed for our laptop case/wireless charging product. When you purchase LapZap, you receive everything that you need in a single package. That is the convenience and brilliance behind our design: we have left nothing out, integrating every part that you need to go about your device-enabled day!</p>
<p><br/>Use Your Devices on Your Own Terms</p>
<p>When we applied for the LapZap patent, the process went smoothly because there is nothing else like this out there. This is an impressive stride for the laptop case market, enabling you to share power from your laptop to your smartphone so that you never end up with a low battery. Whichever of the two devices you need throughout the day, you can use them as much as you want to – ready for a recharge anytime and anywhere.</p>
<p><br/>What We Need &amp; What You Get</p>
<p>Right now, we are turning to you for help raising the funds that we need to manufacture, market, and distribute LapZap on a large scale. We also need to incorporate our company so that we can operate as a real business. To do all this, we are looking to raise ${42,000}, which will cover all the start-up costs that we are up against.</p>
<p>To say thanks to everyone who makes a contribution to this campaign, we are offering some exciting rewards, including discounts on LapZap – plus larger discounts on orders of two, three, five, and ten units.</p>
<p>Make your contribution now and help us bring our laptop case/wireless charging combo to people all around the world!</p>
<p><br/>Risks &amp; Challenges</p>
<p>We are aware of how important manufacturing is for this product. Nothing short of perfection will do if we are going to make this the reliable, groundbreaking laptop case/wireless charging combo that we know it can be. We have already selected a manufacturing partner, and once we hit our minimum order levels, we will be able to move forward immediately. If we run into any logistical challenges along the way, we will be sure to keep all our contributors updated, sending out regular notes about the progress that we are making.</p>
<p><br/>Our Plans for the Future</p>
<p>We will produce LapZap to support Macbook first, but in the long run, we would like to support any laptops that our customers use. If you need a case for your laptop, we want you to feel like LapZap has you covered. This is the first of many innovative products that we have planned, and if you contribute to this campaign, you will receive news any time we start work on another one. Our dedication to moving technology is strong, and we want to include you every step of the way.</p>
<p><br/>Other Ways You Can Help</p>
<p>In addition to making a monetary contribution to this campaign, you can show your support for LapZap by sharing a link to this campaign on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, and any other social media platforms you use. The more people are aware of what we are doing, the smoother this launch will go. If you use a Macbook and an iPhone every day or you know someone else who does, this product could be life-changing. Let's spread the word so that everyone knows about it!</p>
<p>We appreciate all your support, and we thank you for taking the time to read about what we are doing.<br/> </p>

Especially EU citizens are often surprised by the duty to pay large sums for VAT and administrative charges at delivery of their much anticipated product; because it was not included in their pledge. The duty to pay VAT cannot be omitted. However, by importing products in a bulk shipment to the EU, we can save you excessive administrative charges as all VAT and customs are paid by us. Within the EU the parcels can be individually forwarded at low cost and arrive at your doorstep without any surprises. <b>Pledged sums of EU citizens include VAT in the highlighted shipping costs!</b></p><p>For any shipments to the US or other international locations we have done our best to minimize shipping costs. Unfortunately we cannot take care of customs in countries outside the EU (despite Switzerland) but luckily the tax burden outside the EU is generally much lower. In the US, for example, there is a 200$ tax-free threshold that µPeek can slip through.</p><p></p><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img alt=""Micrographs of tissue sections and rock samples taken by µPeek"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/005/130/626/ee536abde7b3c54c98c8eb9d8f0d6fc4_original.jpg?v=1451485142&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;q=92&amp;s=ca6c1d305aaf8b8ee5eae4e34bbbe831"" src="""" style=""""/><figcaption><i>Micrographs of tissue sections and rock samples taken by µPeek</i></figcaption><figcaption><i><br/></i></figcaption></figure><p></p><h1>Size Matters</h1><p>Not much larger than a credit card and about half the thickness of an average smartphone, µPeek comfortably disappears into any pocket and snugly fits into your wallet.

<h1><b>Heads Up with Upscale Microscopes</b></h1>
<p>When combined with a smartphone µPeek offers magnification of approximately 30x – 300x, depending on the smartphone used and the chosen zoom factor. Courtesy of its high-quality optics images remain undistorted and sharp across the whole range of magnification. In terms of image quality µPeek closely aligns with the performance of professional microscopes but – at comparable resolution power – it can offer larger viewable areas (i.e. field-of view).</p>

<h1><b>Why we created µPeek - A Story of Opportunity</b></h1>
<p>Scrona was initially founded to commercialize a novel 3D inkjet printing technology, which is the highest-resolution inkjet-based technology that exists to date. To showcase the printed nanoscale features, we needed a portable, yet powerful microscope. This simply didn’t exist at the time… and triggered the conception of µPeek.</p>
<p>To our great satisfaction, we found that early prototypes of µPeek not only solved our problems, but also generated overwhelming interest and fascination. We suddenly realized how cool our creation really was! The entrepreneurial mindset took its own course. We decided to improve this device and transform it into a stand-alone product.</p>
<p>After months of additional development, µPeek was released to the Kickstarter community, achieved almost 200% of its funding goal and is now available for pre-order on Indiegogo inDemand. We believe that crowdfunding platforms like indiegogo are ‘the‘ places where ideas and innovation are valued above all. Therefore, we not only want to sell a great product to you; but involve you further. By pledging to our campaign, you will also support the further development of our 3D printing technology, helping us bring it from an early stage to a funding-ready technology platform, which can eventually hit the market, creating a strong impact. Scrona is currently also participating in a call for a European Project, with more than ten industrial partners throughout Europe and the US.

</div></div>","Microscopy is one of most fundamental disciplines for exploring the incredible diversity of life from its very bottom. µPeek invites you to start discovering the fascinating microcosm in a uniquely simple, yet powerful way.What is µPeek?µPeek is a sleek gadget that lets users perform microscopy with their smartphones in an equally abundant and artistic way as they do photography. µPeek is the first smartphone microscope that combines the functionality of a full-fledged microscope with pleasing aesthetics, true everyday portability and user-friendly operation via an Android/iOS App.Magnification series using smartphone zoomThe Swiss-Army Knife of MicroscopesDespite its sleek form factor µPeek is full of technology. A motorized 4-element lens creates undistorted high-quality images and sophisticated illumination optics put your specimen in the right light. Everything wirelessly controlled by the supplied App.For example, while focusing with competing products generally involves painful manual adjustments, µPeek lets the in-built motor do the job. Meanwhile, keep your device calm and take razor-sharp images that suffice both your scientific AND artistic curiosity.µPeek supports work with standardized microscope slides by providing a precision slide holder with every µPeek delivered. The holder fixes the slide in position and contains surface regions that improve the uniformity of specimen illumination in the different microscopy modes. With your µPeek you will receive a set of empty slides and a guide to easy specimen preparation.A Companion that Doesn't Fall ApartBecause portability is one of µPeek’s main deliverables, the slide holder has been designed to seamlessly merge with µPeek into a single device. Simply stick the slide holder to the sticky tape and hold both pieces in place. Conventiently, this also protects the sticky tape from collecting dirt.µPeek PersonalizedDon’t like golden yellow? No problem! Choose from another four colors and give µPeek your personal touchAdded Features
How Does it Work?µPeek works in a simple and convenient way with almost any specimen that catches your attention. To get started it is suggested that you place µPeek straight onto your subject of interest. This way you create a stable platform and directly move into a good focus position. When working with a slide, you best place it into the slide holder first. µPeek can then be moved along the specimen without touching it.Utilizing µPeek with a prepared microscope slide and neatly put it away after use.Rewards
International Shipping - EU-Friendly FulfillmentWe understand that high shipping costs can be a major concern on crowdfunding platforms. Especially EU citizens are often surprised by the duty to pay large sums for VAT and administrative charges at delivery of their much anticipated product; because it was not included in their pledge. The duty to pay VAT cannot be omitted. However, by importing products in a bulk shipment to the EU, we can save you excessive administrative charges as all VAT and customs are paid by us. Within the EU the parcels can be individually forwarded at low cost and arrive at your doorstep without any surprises. Pledged sums of EU citizens include VAT in the highlighted shipping costs!For any shipments to the US or other international locations we have done our best to minimize shipping costs. Unfortunately we cannot take care of customs in countries outside the EU (despite Switzerland) but luckily the tax burden outside the EU is generally much lower. In the US, for example, there is a 200$ tax-free threshold that µPeek can slip through.Micrographs of tissue sections and rock samples taken by µPeekSize MattersNot much larger than a credit card and about half the thickness of an average smartphone, µPeek comfortably disappears into any pocket and snugly fits into your wallet. Available whenever you find an opportunity to explore and capture your environment, µPeek opens up an entirely new way of satisfying your curiosity. Attachment - Sleek and SimpleWhen designing µPeek, we deliberately decided against having a smartphone-specific attachment case. Instead, µPeek comes with a thin layer of carefully selected adhesive. The elastic sticky tape conforms to your smartphone and detaches again without leaving traces. This form of attachment is universally applicable, aesthetic and saves space. To check if your smartphone is compatible with µPeek, please visit this page. The list on this page is not final, and chances are good that a smartphone not yet listed there is still compatible with µPeek. Every µPeek will come with all three sticky pad types! Hence, you don't have to make up your head about which one is most suitable for you. Just try them as you get your device. And in order to provide best compatibility for today's and future phones of yours, the sticky pads are exchangeable.Attaching µPeek to your smartphone and removing it again. All done in less than ten seconds.And what if the sticky pad loses grip? Rinse it under a stream of water, as µPeek is fully splash proof.The µPeek App µPeek was not made to be an unintelligent auxiliary device. It has been created to empower you with full control via our proprietary Android/iOS Apps. µPeek features a low-energy Bluetooth module for quick connection to your smartphone. Once connected, you can use the App to control light and focus, and of course take and share pictures and videos as you go.On the inside - LED dimming via µPeek App

Multiple Microscopy Modes - Single Device
µPeek’s innovative (patent-pending) illumination design allows performing several distinctive modes of microscopy. Besides standard bright-field microscopy, µPeek handles dark-field and fluorescence (only µPeek Blue) microscopy, as well as polarized illumination. These advanced techniques are used by experts to highlight different visual aspects, and in fact create beautiful variations of one and the same specimen. µPeek democratizes access to these techniques and lets users experience nature in all its facets. 

One and the same specimen section imaged with different illumination modes

One and the same specimen section imaged with different illumination modesBy selectively dimming µPeek’s light sources, you can individually tune any of the different microscopy modes separately with our App. Personalize the outcome of your observations by combining the information of all available microscopy modes into your favorite visual setting.

µPeek Blue - A True Expert Package
Equipped with UV lights and a UV cut-off filter µPeek Blue masters fluorescence microscopy. µPeek Blue integrates almost all professionally relevant microscopy modes. As an all-round tool µPeek Blue enhances laboratory environments or can be used for quality control in industry. To non-professional users µPeek Blue provides the ultimate exploratory experience. For example, investigate the fluorescent materials on bank notes, or those naturally found in plants or minerals.

Heads Up with Upscale Microscopes
When combined with a smartphone µPeek offers magnification of approximately 30x – 300x, depending on the smartphone used and the chosen zoom factor. Courtesy of its high-quality optics images remain undistorted and sharp across the whole range of magnification. In terms of image quality µPeek closely aligns with the performance of professional microscopes but – at comparable resolution power – it can offer larger viewable areas (i.e. field-of view).


Low Cost - Democratization of Microscopy
µPeek is the first platform that opens up the full diversity of microscopy at an affordable price tag. Compared to conventional microscopes with a similar breath of functionality, µPeek equips a whole classroom at the cost of a single device. 

If you like µPeek as much as we do you may be interested in hearing that you can buy about two dozen of them at the price of a functionally similar lab microscope ;-)
Community
At Scrona, the micro- and nanoworld fascinate us! And we want to share our enthusiasm with the world. Our vision is for µPeek to enable education at schools and for individuals. We plan to build a community where people share their pictures and exchange their findings on optimal illumination settings. We would be delighted if this could encourage remote diagnostics or simply introduce people to the full beauty of life.

Timeline



Why we created µPeek - A Story of Opportunity
Scrona was initially founded to commercialize a novel 3D inkjet printing technology, which is the highest-resolution inkjet-based technology that exists to date. To showcase the printed nanoscale features, we needed a portable, yet powerful microscope. This simply didn’t exist at the time… and triggered the conception of µPeek.
To our great satisfaction, we found that early prototypes of µPeek not only solved our problems, but also generated overwhelming interest and fascination. We suddenly realized how cool our creation really was! The entrepreneurial mindset took its own course. We decided to improve this device and transform it into a stand-alone product.
After months of additional development, µPeek was released to the Kickstarter community, achieved almost 200% of its funding goal and is now available for pre-order on Indiegogo inDemand. We believe that crowdfunding platforms like indiegogo are ‘the‘ places where ideas and innovation are valued above all. Therefore, we not only want to sell a great product to you; but involve you further. By pledging to our campaign, you will also support the further development of our 3D printing technology, helping us bring it from an early stage to a funding-ready technology platform, which can eventually hit the market, creating a strong impact. Scrona is currently also participating in a call for a European Project, with more than ten industrial partners throughout Europe and the US. For more information about our revolutionary printing technology – for example on how it could be used to manufacture flexible displays – visit www.scrona.com.

<h3>Why Prufen Smart USB Cables?</h3>
<p>My name is Sian-Ee Goh and am an Electrical Engineer from Oklahoma State University,  USA.  </p>
<p>It bugs me when I observe many unsurpulous manufacturers exploiting customers: </p>
<p>(1) There are many 3rd party  USB power adaptors that are poorly designed with over-exaggerated specification.   These adaptors run the risk of power overload which is extremely hazardous.   I have encountered an common 3rd party adaptor that is specified at 1.5A but is already overloaded at 0.5A!   Have you encountered adaptors that are hot to the touch?   </p>

<p>(2) poor quality 3rd party Charging Cable.   Many charging cables in the market are largely plastic with little wire thus high impedence.  The high impedence cause the cable to charge slow, if at all.  Some of these poor quality cable even have the audacity to claim that they can charge 3X to 10X faster.   LMAO.  </p>

<h3>1. Checks Temperature of Both Power Adaptor and Phone</h3>
<p>Prufen Cables contains 2 temperature sensors at both ends of the cable.  Now you can measure the temperature of your power adaptor as well as your phone.  Prufen Smart Cable automatically shuts down when temperature reached 55 deg C for normal charging and 65 deg C for high power charging (eg.

We all know someone that has lost a Smartphone due to water damage, from a drop in the tub or toilet, or even talking in the rain. Replacing your smartphone is expensive, time-consuming and frustrating; the loss of your phone’s use is one of the biggest inconveniences. 

WaterSeal Technology was started when Craig Dunn's beloved iPhone accidentally plummeted to the bottom of a  hot tub- triggering the notion that we should be able to protect against this.  WaterSeal is very much a true start-up company; bootstrap funded by two Calgarians, Craig Dunn and Mike Wellwood, who after a ton of research and development work, created a unique process that fully protects your smartphone from accidental water damage. This process is unique in the industry as we treat the inside of the
phone, where the electronics are; growing a microscopically thin layer of
translucent, waterproof material, right onto the inside of the smartphone. The result: No bulky case & no loss of functionality. We guarantee that water protection for the life of your phone. 
Why WaterSeal? See for yourself...


Our biggest challenge to date has been making sure we could do what we say we can do,  fully protect your smartphone from the accidental water damage that happen in daily life. Our early stage product was a straightforward technical solution to treatment but it offered very limited protection.  We had to go back to the drawing board and build a better treatment methodology and while MANY smartphones were gravely harmed in the perfecting of WaterSeal’s service, we’ve done it. All WaterSealed phones can survive a short submersion unharmed (we call it the toilet test: 30 seconds at 30 centimeters!).
Want proof? Ask Ernie...
WaterSeal has done extensive R&D and  has currently established a successful methodology for treating some of the best smartphones on the market, including iPhone 4, 4S & 5, and Samsung Galaxy and Discover and Blackberry Bold. We are continuing to add new phones (including the Q10 & Z10 Blackberries) to the list as our R&D and “Torture Testing“ continue.  
We need your help! 
The feedback to the initial product has been AMAZING, and we already have stories from our existing customers about how WaterSeal saved their phone from their adventures.  Our phones have survived fly-fishing adventures, swims with a goldfish, beer pint accidents, and even a swim in the Bow River in Calgary.  However, we want to be able to make WaterSeal Technology available across Canada, so that all Canadians can fearlessly take their smartphones on all their adventures. 





We started this campaign to help fund our R&D program, to be able to add more devices to the list of smartphones we can protect and to help us to be able to provide our service nationally.  We hope to be able to build out our ""Ship to"" model for customers outside Calgary, and then to license our technology to cities across Canada and USA. We want to improve the turnaround time for getting customers' phones back to them so that they are only without their phones for hours and not days. 

The first $5,000 in funds raised is going towards the integration of our shipping program and website integration to ensure that your phones are shipped safely and timely.  Any further funding will allow us to develop our licensing program and continue R&D on new models of phones. Every dollar counts and will allow us to add more devices to the mix (we are currently looking at Tablets and Point of Sale Devices). Your Smartphone is your Best Friend: Protect It!
A few interesting facts about smartphone damage: (by SquareTrade research)


Americans have spent $7.2 Billion on damaged Android phones & $5.9 billion spent on damaged iPhones.

As Americans integrate their phones into an increasing number of daily routines and habits, accidental damage is 10-13x more common than loss and theft.
Half of American parents say kids have damaged a mobile phone, laptop or tablet and 33% of kid-caused accidents involved food or drink.
30% of iPhone owners have experienced accidental damage in last year & 18% of those were immersed in liquid and 9% of those were a liquid spill.
Half of iPhone users under 35 have had an accident.
9% of iPhone owners have dropped their phone in the toilet & 5% in the washing machine.

The Team to take it to the Finish Line: 
The co-founders Mike Wellwood and Craig Dunn are both serial entrepreneurs with a history of innovative start-ups in technology, energy and finance. We are very happy to be able to work together on this incredible project. We have also built an incredible support team of some of the brightest folks in
finance, marketing and technology and they have helped us get to where we are
today. We have been very lucky that many on our team strongly believed in the
potential of WaterSeal Technology. We are very excited to bring this service to market and appreciate any community support to make that happen.

Introducing the Stone, a smart remote for your phone and smart devices. It is a tiny device that controls any app on your smartphone with a single button and helps finds lost items. Simplify your life with one button for it all: take a selfie, upload it to Facebook, share your location, turn your lights off from bed, and much more.Smarten up your home, your keychain and your life with natural sleek Stones.







Control your Home



 


Perfect For Parties!



For those group pics when your arm isn't long enough.


Range alerts come in handy.









Or, put it on anything to get alerted before you leave it behind like your re-usable grocery bags, umbrella,  jacket at a restaurant, or water bottle at the gym.

It has a thermometer.





Set notifications for if things become too warm like your car, garage, or wine cellar. 

Stay safe while driving.

 Send pre-loaded texts like ""On my way"" or ""Running late"" without using your phone. It's safe, not to mention legal!

Ever feel uneasy on your walk home?

On your walk home, have the button set to let your friends or family know where you are or call 911. Have the peace of mind that help is only a discrete press away.

Find Your Lost Stuff:
Misplacing your keys—or anything really—can quickly throw an unwanted kink in your day. With the Stone, you can prevent this from happening in the first place. 



The Button:



The Button can be set to 2 different control levels:



Manual - Use the app to manually select the TWO actions you want to happen when the button is pressed; quickly press or hold the button down (2 seconds).


Automatic - preset the action to auto-change based on the time of day.





Setup a Recipe:
In this example, we  change the Stone's Quick Press command from ordering a pizza to an S.O.S. Emergency.




(Left Image) Select the Edit Icon on the Main Screen. The Main Screen has two customizable options tied to the Stone's Press Types: Click and Hold.
(Right Image) Find the desired recipe and select it. Once the recipe is confirmed, your Stone will be set to command that action until you change it.



Use the Stone to...






Easy to Setup:

How It Works:




The Stone is powered by a Bluetooth Low Energy iBeacon, a standard certified by Apple, that allows your smart phone to natively detect your Stone without running the app at all! By pressing the button you activate the Stone's iBeacon communication which automatically interacts with any BLE platform nearby (your phone - iOS or Android), automatically letting them know its proximity and triggering the commands you pre-established.

The Shortcut button works by using IFTTT logic: If This Then That. IFTTT simply states that if circumstances are this, then the action desired will be that. That is called a recipe. For example, one recipe would be, ""If I am leaving my driveway and press my Stone's button, I want the house doors to lock."" There are a million things you can do with this. If you would like to learn more you can find the IFTTT explanation here. What you need to know is that the Stone can be an ingredient (channel) in any of those recipes you decide to create there.

</div></div>","Carying power banks, cables and memory separately is outdated! We believe that every power bank should have integrated charge/sync cable and memory card reader. That is exact reason why we developed world's first smart multi-functional mobile phone gadget with integrated cable, memory card reader and smart power bank features.Our customers worldwide are delighted with QIUB and you should check why!             Recommended by:

WHY HAVE WE DEVELOPED QIUB?  
As you can probably relate, carrying around big chargers, flash memory drives and cables every day can be a huge hassle.
What if there was one device that could hold it all?
QIUB is a multi functional device with an integrated cable and memory card reader that replaces the need to carry multiple phone accessories.


 


Once you start using the QIUB you will never use any other cable or power bank!

 

 
QIUB has following functions:
 

 
QIUB WILL REPLACE THE NEED TO CARRY SEVERAL DEVICES!
With QIUB, we challenged our team to revolutionize the functions of a regular power bank and re-think a way to replace the need to carry several devices. 
Our goal is to revolutionize the way people use power banks and we believe that every power bank should have integrated cable, extra features and be small, practical and easy to use!
We developed a smart product that is multi functional, durable, compact, lightweight and, above all, practical.
Here is the quote from friend that used QIUB for few weeks: 
QIUB is ""The Cool looking Swiss Army Knife"" of power banks!
 

 
1 - NEVER Run Out Of BATTERY Ever Again! 
 
 
Is your phone begging for juice? Just plug in your QIUB. High capacity power on the go with up to 50% of battery charge for Iphone 6. With QIUB, make it through the day without worrying about your battery level. 
 2 - QIUB is ALWAYS with YOU!
 
The best part is, this entire powerhouse fits in your pocket. QIUB packs a significant battery capacity into a surprisingly small space. It’s compact enough to fit into your pocket or on your key ring so your power bank gives you maximum portability but never weighs you down.
Perfect at work, in the car or on a trip, there’s no need to carry around any other accessory.
 
 

 
3 - POWER UP Your QIUB And Phone Subsequently. 
 
Simply plug your QIUB into your phone and power source to start charging your phone. When your smartphone is fully charged, QIUB will redirect the charge to its own internal battery.  
 
 
 
4 - Memory Storage On The Go.
QIUB turns your power bank into a memory storage device. It can read any Micro-SD card up to 64GB and is compatible with any computer. QIUB is also perfect place to keep safe your Micro-SD memory card.
 

 
5 - Out Of Sight Cable.
 
We all face messy cables that get easily tangled. QIUB cables fold neatly into the device avoiding cluttered and disordered cables. Our strong and durable custom-made cables are made out of a colorful, hard-wearing and resistant material. 
 
 
 

 
                 Apple and Android versions available

QIUB is available in 2 vibrant colors - green MFI certified cable for Apple and blue cable for Android

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hello my name is skyler I am 13 yrs old, and with the help of my uncle zack I am trying to start a campaign to replace or repair my broken laptop which a couple of weeks ago got broken when my brothers friend thought it would be funny to hide it under a reclining chair and has refused to take responsability and replace it. It started as a crack on the screen but, now it has been getting way worse as a liquid is now seeping in between my screen making my computer almost impossible to use and reducing my ability to complete schoolwork that relies on my computer. My uncle also feels that this will be a good learning experience and teach me a new skill so with his help and supervision I have created this to seek help for my problem. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
</div>
<div>
<p>With the money that is donated I will replace or repair my laptop. If my goal is met I will buy a replacment laptop and repair my old one and donate it to someone that needs it.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you can't donate then I would appreciate if you could help make this a successfull first effort at creating a crowdfunding campaign. Thank you.</p>
<h3>Funding</h3>
<p>All the funding donated will be handled by my uncle because I am not 18 and don't have a paypal account, and remember that a dollar can count too. Thank you.</p>
<h3>Also</h3>
<p>I am working on a series of books, so a new laptop would make it easier to write which i will have another campaign about if this one is succesful. </p>

Each MeterPlug is designed to work universally from 100V to 240V AC. You could take a USA version, and use it in China, Europe, or Australia, with a simple local adapter.




Remember that MeterPlug doesn’t convert Electricity. So if you use a USA version, and your country is 220V, don’t plug in 110V appliances.

What is the maximum Current MeterPlug can measure and handle?

MeterPlug can measure and handle up to 16A, from 100V to 240V AC.





Are you planning on making plus for Australia, China and Israel?
At this moment we are concentrating on:

North American plug: NEMA 5-15 (15 A/125 V grounded)
European Plug: CEE 7/7 plug
British plug: BS1363
China Plug



What if I use an appliance that has no ground pin (2-pin plug)?

MeterPlug doesn’t require a ground pin to measure your consumption. You can even plug in a shaver, and it will still work!

Does MeterPlug have Surge-protection?  

No, MeterPlug has no Surge Protection. If you live in an area with increased lighting strikes, it is recommended to plug MeterPlug after a socket or power strip with surge protection.

What is the power consumption of MeterPlug?  

0.1Watts. That's about 1 Cent cost per year!

How does MeterPlug communicate with my Smartphone?

MeterPlug communicates via Bluetooth Low Energy (Bluetooth 4.0)

What Smartphones does the MeterPlug work with?

MeterPlug works iPhone 4s, iPhone 5, the New iPad, iPad mini, and the New iPod touch. It also works on Android devices supporting Bluetooth 4.0, running Android 4.0 and newer. We have tested it on the Samsung Galaxy S3 and Note 2, and it works great on both devices! (Since the support for Bluetooth 4.0 on the Samsung S3 is bad, we wrote the Bluetooth drivers on our own)

Can more than one phone control a MeterPlug?

Any Phone/Tablet paired with a MeterPlug, can communicate with it, get consumption readings, and turn it on or off.

How many MeterPlugs can be paired to my phone at the same time?

In theory, you can add and pair as many MeterPlugs to your phone as you like. We recommend not pairing more than 100, as it might slow down the phone's database.
Only one MeterPlug at a time can be accessed from your phone. When you want to use another MeterPlug, just swipe with your fingers on the app and select another MeterPlug.

Do I need a separate adapter on my phone or special case?

No, you don't need any adapter or special case. MeterPlug will communicate directly with your Smartphone via Bluetooth 4.0.

 What is the range of MeterPlug?


Approximately 100 feet or about 30 Meters.



How does ""Vampire Shield"" work?

When Activated, MeterPlug learns the regular consumption of your appliance. When the consumption goes down but remains ""On"" for more than a set time, MeterPlug will know this is vampire power, and cut off the power. When your phone is in range, it will turn the power back on. This will greatly help you lower your bill!
There is a manual On/Off button on the side of MeterPlug, in case you're not home, and there is no device at home with Bluetooth 4.0 to turn it back on.

Can your phone turn the power On or Off while you are not home?

Your paired phone must be within the 100 feet range of the MeterPlug to turn the power On/Off.

What if someone at home wants to turn on the MeterPlug, and there is no compatible phone or tablet to turn it on?

MeterPlug comes with a small side button. Once pressed,  it will override and turn on the appliance.

<p><b>Sphere of application</b><br/>
You will need Portable VZcase safes, while there isn’t an opportunity to use a fixed safe or you just want to hide your thing from extra view at hotels, beaches, 
gyms, at the workplace or in any other case, where you need to leave your things unkept.
</p>
<p><b>Material<a name=""material"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a></b><br/>
Case Material VZcase – Titanium grade VT8.<br/>
Why Titan? Our main goal is to create such a case, the access to the inner part of it will be very labour-intensive process without the opening code. 
The device should be cheap, compact and easy to carrying. According to the following characteristics we chose to use Titanium. 
Titanium is used in the military industry (bulletproof vests, armor and fire walls in aviation, Corps submarines), 
as well as in the chemical industry and other important areas. Titanium is presented in various space objects.

Opening of the given lock type is set by a combination of five numbers, with the help of rotating discs. The amount of numbers on one disk is 10, from 0 up to 9, 
in such case the number of combinations is equal to one hundred thousand (ten to the fifth power), which makes the

This variant is the most simple and cheap, since we do not use a variety of electrical schemes and power in it, moreover there is no need to use the software.

My story




We have designed two types of devices -  these are «Size S» and «Size M»
Each device has four types of locks:

Mechanical combination lock
Electronic combination lock
Bluetooth lock. Access via Bluetooth using password
Biometric lock. Fingerprint access. In development


Design VZcase
A major goal is facing us to create the most simple and stylish design, and the need to keep minimum measurements  for usability, 
for example, put it in your pants or shirt pocket, in your bag or just hold it in your hand.




Software
We have already created an alpha version of the software for Windows 7 32bit, which allows you to change the password to the device «VZcase». 
In the near future we plan to create software for Mac OS, Windows 8, Linux. Our major goal is to supply the security of password cracking by another person, 
if the device is stolen or lost.Android
And also we have software for android. To control the device with the type of bluetooth lock, ie open-close.iOS
Coming soon.


 


Sphere of application
You will need Portable VZcase safes, while there isn’t an opportunity to use a fixed safe or you just want to hide your thing from extra view at hotels, beaches, 
gyms, at the workplace or in any other case, where you need to leave your things unkept.

Material
Case Material VZcase – Titanium grade VT8.
Why Titan? Our main goal is to create such a case, the access to the inner part of it will be very labour-intensive process without the opening code. 
The device should be cheap, compact and easy to carrying. According to the following characteristics we chose to use Titanium. 
Titanium is used in the military industry (bulletproof vests, armor and fire walls in aviation, Corps submarines), 
as well as in the chemical industry and other important areas. Titanium is presented in various space objects.

Crowdfunding Platform and laser engraving
Our company on the indiegogo will last from November 1 to January 1. 
On the device VZcase, ordered through indiegogo, we do laser engraving your text, it uses special application form in your account on our site.
Example of the text for laser engraving can be as follows: your initials, signature, home address, phone number, a love expression to your girl and another. 
We have developed a special form to receive applications for laser engraving. It can be filled in the personal account of our website, in the application, 
you can write your text and arrangement of the text directly on a portable VZcase safe. Use the special form on our website in your account.
See FAQ.
Objective of financing
For a mass production starting, we need the amount of 30 000 $ (thirty thousand dollars), 
for which we will be able to purchase Titanium, to make electric boards, molds, li-ion batteries and 
other small elements. Also, this amount includes the development of software under various operating systems 
(Mac OS, Windows 7/8, Linux) to work with the device (the password changing or resetting), 
the website creation for device registration and technical support.

What we promise in return?
In return, we promise our device «VZcase» at a low price and possibility to be the first to use our product. 
We do a 15% discount for all sponsors for one year, which will be linked to your email address. 
You will be able to use the discount on buying on our website vzcase.com. Our range of devices «VZcase» 
will constantly keep up to date; we'll add a variety of colors, new design, new features, GPS - GSM tracking and others.
And also thank you very much for your help in the development of our project.




Quick video instruction:
1. Account creation on the website vzcase.com
2. Device Registration on the website vzcase.com
3. Change Password - using our software.
4. Reset Forgotten Password - using our software and service code.



Electronic combination lock
The lock is opened by consequential pressing a combination of 5 numbers on the special button. After five unsuccessful attempts to enter the device is locked for 30 seconds. 
Each button press followed by lighting the yellow LED. The maximum password length is 10 numbers. 
The password can consist of numbers only from 1 up to 5.





Mechanical combination lock
Opening of the given lock type is set by a combination of five numbers, with the help of rotating discs. The amount of numbers on one disk is 10, from 0 up to 9, 
in such case the number of combinations is equal to one hundred thousand (ten to the fifth power), which makes the 
code fitting as an exhaustive search (brute force)and very labour-intensive process.
This variant is the most simple and cheap, since we do not use a variety of electrical schemes and power in it, moreover there is no need to use the software.





Bluetooth lock. Access via Bluetooth using password
The opening of the lock through Bluetooth using a mobile phone, entering the appropriate password. 	It will be locked after mobile-disconnecting from the device.
There are only two buttons on the case, on-off button bluetooth module and the button for interfacing with other devices. 
It is provided a protection from brute force password guessing (brute force), by blocking access for 30 seconds after five unsuccessful attempts to enter the password.update 1
Use special software to control the device. See





Biometric lock. Fingerprint access.
Given access mechanism to the device is in development. 
It is planning to create software for this type of access to read fingerprints and add them to VZcase device‘s memory.

<p><strong>- Did you know that the daily consumption of all iOS devices is as big as the daily power consumption of New York?</strong></p>
<p><strong>- Did you know, that the use of B charged app can reduce your battery consumption by 37%?</strong><br/><br/><strong>Do you have the problem with the battery life on your iDevice?</strong><br/>The most bothering problem of iPhone users is their battery life. Many of you are turning to the forums requesting any advices from other iPhone users, how to increase the battery life. Many of these advices are not professional and are often misleading, or do not solve the real problem.<br/><br/>Since we specialise in the energy sector our whole professional life, we want to approach mainly with EXPERTISE and reality. As you may have noticed, mobile device market has grown enormously in the last 10 years. Phone technology has moved a big step forward. But despite of this huge progress, there is still something that grows in slower way - phone's battery. Modern technologies and apps discharge the battery so fast, that you even do not leave your house without taking your charger with you. That's why we have decided to do a detailed analysis of battery consumption of all available iPhones, iPods and iPads.</p>
<p><strong>The core of B charged app is the detailed analysis of battery consumption of all functions and apps.</strong></p>
<div class=""template""><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.futureinvestments.eu/apple/Picture5.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></div>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>The most important functions of B charged app:</strong></p>
<p> <strong>B prepared feature: how to increase the efficiency of the battery consumption on your iDevice</strong><br/><br/>B prepared feature helps you to find out the current battery consumption of your iDevice. We decided to bring you some new units such as ""Watt-hours"" and ""% / hour"" in order to more accurately determine the consumption of your battery.</p>
<p><br/><strong>B prepared feature is a helper, which will show you what activities are loading your system the most and how you can effectively handle them.</strong><strong> </strong></p>
<div class=""template""><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.futureinvestments.eu/apple/Picture1.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></div>
<p>The most common recommendation for increasing battery life on iPhones is to turn off functions. These advices are not supported by any real testing. For example, it is recommended to reduce the brightness from 100% to 80%. But how much do you really increase battery life? These questions can be answered by the B charged feature.</p>
<p><strong>B Steady feature: Do not let your battery discharge</strong></p>
<p>Another important feature of B charged app is the B Steady feature, the manager which will help you to plan a battery life during the day. This feature displays a daily graph of your battery consumption and activities.</p>
<div class=""template""><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.futureinvestments.eu/apple/Picture2.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></div>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>You can focus on your life; we will focus on your battery.</strong><br/>Do you know the feeling when you have just 60% of your battery in the morning and you really do not know if your iPhone will last up to 4 PM? But you know that you will need to send approximately 20 emails, make 30 calls, use RSS and navigation for an hour and play some games.</p>
<p>In that case, B steady feature is made just for you. The core of B steady feature are modes as “work”, “school”, “day off” etc. You can customise the applications you use the most in each mode. With this information we can calculate how long your battery will last. B steady feature makes sure your telephone will not go off.</p>
<p><em>Example: </em><em>John wakes up at 8 AM. The “work” mode, he set up in the B steady feature starts at 9 AM. B charged app will evaluate the activities, which he normally does in “work” mode on his iPhone and finds out the expected battery condition at 4 PM – the end of “work” mode. The app will notify you that you can not forget to take your charger, because the expected condition of your iPhone battery at the end of the work will be at 7%.</em></p>
<p><strong>B charged feature: Let your battery last longer</strong></p>
<div class=""template""><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.futureinvestments.eu/apple/Picture3.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></div>
<p>B charged feature brings you the best way of charging – whole-cycle charging system. Based on our research and statistics, we have upgraded it and we bring two charging modes in app:</p>

<p><strong>Comparison of iOS</strong></p>
<p>Surely you can remember the recent problem with battery life of iPhone 4 and iPhone 4s when updated on iOS 5. There were many advices to extend battery life with iOS 5 but most of them were quite uncomfortable for users. Some tips were bit extreme - if you wanted the battery life you had with the iOS 4, you needed to turn off all new functions of iOS 5. Most of us were unhappy with the shortage of battery life in iOS 5. One of our goals is to draw the attention to the severity of the new iOS and give you the comparison to them. We want to inform you in advance whether it is worth to upgrade to the new operating system.</p>
<p><br/><strong>Our commitment to the future</strong></p>
<p>Our greatest commitment towards the future is to constantly research and improve the battery consumption and charging cycles to make your iDevice last longer. The philosophy of B charged app is the effective battery consumption optimised directly to your iDevice. We are working on new features that we will bring you in the next updates such as: setting and controlling the consumption of iDevice synchronised with your Mac, new charging cycles system, optimised directly to your iDevice, and other features that will make B charged app your daily helper.</p>
<p>B prepared, B steady, B charged, B informed</p></div>","B charged is the revolutionary battery management app
- Did you know that the daily consumption of all iOS devices is as big as the daily power consumption of New York?
- Did you know, that the use of B charged app can reduce your battery consumption by 37%?Do you have the problem with the battery life on your iDevice?The most bothering problem of iPhone users is their battery life. Many of you are turning to the forums requesting any advices from other iPhone users, how to increase the battery life. Many of these advices are not professional and are often misleading, or do not solve the real problem.Since we specialise in the energy sector our whole professional life, we want to approach mainly with EXPERTISE and reality. As you may have noticed, mobile device market has grown enormously in the last 10 years. Phone technology has moved a big step forward. But despite of this huge progress, there is still something that grows in slower way - phone's battery. Modern technologies and apps discharge the battery so fast, that you even do not leave your house without taking your charger with you. That's why we have decided to do a detailed analysis of battery consumption of all available iPhones, iPods and iPads.
The core of B charged app is the detailed analysis of battery consumption of all functions and apps.

 
The most important functions of B charged app:
 B prepared feature: how to increase the efficiency of the battery consumption on your iDeviceB prepared feature helps you to find out the current battery consumption of your iDevice. We decided to bring you some new units such as ""Watt-hours"" and ""% / hour"" in order to more accurately determine the consumption of your battery.
B prepared feature is a helper, which will show you what activities are loading your system the most and how you can effectively handle them. 

The most common recommendation for increasing battery life on iPhones is to turn off functions. These advices are not supported by any real testing. For example, it is recommended to reduce the brightness from 100% to 80%. But how much do you really increase battery life? These questions can be answered by the B charged feature.
B Steady feature: Do not let your battery discharge
Another important feature of B charged app is the B Steady feature, the manager which will help you to plan a battery life during the day. This feature displays a daily graph of your battery consumption and activities.

 
You can focus on your life; we will focus on your battery.Do you know the feeling when you have just 60% of your battery in the morning and you really do not know if your iPhone will last up to 4 PM? But you know that you will need to send approximately 20 emails, make 30 calls, use RSS and navigation for an hour and play some games.
In that case, B steady feature is made just for you. The core of B steady feature are modes as “work”, “school”, “day off” etc. You can customise the applications you use the most in each mode. With this information we can calculate how long your battery will last. B steady feature makes sure your telephone will not go off.
Example: John wakes up at 8 AM. The “work” mode, he set up in the B steady feature starts at 9 AM. B charged app will evaluate the activities, which he normally does in “work” mode on his iPhone and finds out the expected battery condition at 4 PM – the end of “work” mode. The app will notify you that you can not forget to take your charger, because the expected condition of your iPhone battery at the end of the work will be at 7%.
B charged feature: Let your battery last longer

B charged feature brings you the best way of charging – whole-cycle charging system. Based on our research and statistics, we have upgraded it and we bring two charging modes in app:
- eCO mode is designed for daily charging of your iDevice to optimise your battery.- eCO + mode is designed for whole-cycle charging to extend your battery life. It is recommended to use it at least 1 time per 2 weeks.B charged feature will monitor all your charging and will always remind you to use the right charging mode.
B informed feature: Find out which activity is discharging your battery the most. 
Using this feature you will find out, which activity is discharging your iDevice battery the most. We have had prepared dozens of activities and apps that are most commonly used on iDevices. Be informed.

Comparison of iOS
Surely you can remember the recent problem with battery life of iPhone 4 and iPhone 4s when updated on iOS 5. There were many advices to extend battery life with iOS 5 but most of them were quite uncomfortable for users. Some tips were bit extreme - if you wanted the battery life you had with the iOS 4, you needed to turn off all new functions of iOS 5. Most of us were unhappy with the shortage of battery life in iOS 5. One of our goals is to draw the attention to the severity of the new iOS and give you the comparison to them. We want to inform you in advance whether it is worth to upgrade to the new operating system.

<p><b>Our story</b></p>
<p>We are a group of designers and engineers with the desire to create a better consumer experience in electronics. Our team was officially founded in 2013 when we started noticing there was nothing on the market that could do what U+ can. There was not an easy way to store, access, and share videos, music, business documents and other content without access to the Internet. Thus, U+ was born out of the need to be able to share any content, anywhere, anytime. </p>
<p>U+ has been a labor of love for us and creating a positive user experience continues to drive our work. We have taken the time to build a product that is easy to carry everyday and an intuitive easy to use App.  </p>
<p>Now, we are ready to present U+ to the market. We hope you join us in making this product a success. Thank You!</p>
<p><b>Why we need your support</b></p>
<p>We are ready to take the leap and produce our product. We have researched and built the prototypes. We have tested and done our market research. Now, we need financial support for manufacturing. Manufacturing requires a significant investment especially for electrical devices. </p>
<p>We hope to raise enough funds to begin manufacturing our product. Your funding not only supports the manufacturing, but also helps cover our costs of applying for and passing the necessary quality control and certification processes.

<p>Hello, everyone here on indiegogo! My name is Jacob as always, but that's just how I introduce myself on my YouTube videos that I love to do for my fans on my YouTube channel, MrNintendoFanMan. Anyways, the videos have been going great, that is until my two year old laptop started having a lot of problems starting in September 2012. First off, the wireless adaptor broke in there, so instead of getting the entire mother board fixed, I just got a Wireless adapater, so that I still can access the internet. Besides that, the laptop can't hold charge for more than five minutes without automatically shutting down. This typically wouldn't be a problem, but with the port not working to keep the laptop charged (even with the charger in), it has become a problem. Lastly, it shuts off during rendering process because of the port problem, it doesn't help that all but one USB port doesn't work either. The plan was, to wait until late July, to get a new one, but I'd rather not wait 3 months to do videos again. Honestly, if it weren't for the fact I didn't make videos, I'd stick with this one until it literally died, but that isn't the case. The reason behind the campaign is because I have rent I have to pay as well as college expenses, too. I do make some money from YouTube, but it's really not too much. I'd be purchasing an Asus DESKTOP, too. </p>
<p>It is really all about you guys, the fans of my videos. I love making the videos so much for you all, and I love and appreciate you all more than you can ever imagine. You all are the reason, the soul behind my videos! I cannot thank you enough for just taking the time to read this. Anything you guys could donate would be wonderful, the rest  :] </p>

We believe that technology can be a key to unlocking the natural curiosity that drives both educators and students and fuels the desire to learn.  This key should be within reach of every school and district, not just the wealthy. We believe our teachers deserve better than hand-me-downs from the world of consumer electronics.  We approached the product design following these core principles: 
</p>
<p>
<span style=""font-weight: 700;""><b>SIMPLE ADAPTABILITY</b></span><br/>
Every teacher and every classroom is unique,  and they deserve a solution that easily adapts to each unique environment. To be truly adaptable a technology must also be simple enough for every teacher, not just the tech savvy.  Each piece of our system was designed with this quality in mind. 
</p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 700;""><b>NATURAL CURIOSITY</b></span><br/>
Natural curiosity is what drives us to explore possibilities, and we want to empower both students and educators to do the same.  We have created a product that embraces the unique environment of the classroom, and encourage curiosity that is fun, innovative, and beneficial.

The SmartHub centrally connects your desktop computer, DVD player, tablet, laptop, projector, wireless microphone and speakers while giving you the ability to stream content wirelessly from iOS, Android, Windows, or Mac. The SmartHub also includes an Android operating system to create your own custom classroom experience. 





Controlled completely from your tablet, the SmartHub app lets you power the projector on and off, switch between A/V inputs, raise and lower the volume, and control the built in Android operating system.












In The News...





















We believe that technology can be a key to unlocking the natural curiosity that drives both educators and students and fuels the desire to learn.  This key should be within reach of every school and district, not just the wealthy. We believe our teachers deserve better than hand-me-downs from the world of consumer electronics.  We approached the product design following these core principles: 


SIMPLE ADAPTABILITY
Every teacher and every classroom is unique,  and they deserve a solution that easily adapts to each unique environment. To be truly adaptable a technology must also be simple enough for every teacher, not just the tech savvy.  Each piece of our system was designed with this quality in mind. 

NATURAL CURIOSITY
Natural curiosity is what drives us to explore possibilities, and we want to empower both students and educators to do the same.  We have created a product that embraces the unique environment of the classroom, and encourage curiosity that is fun, innovative, and beneficial. 












We plan on using every dollar pledged to place a SmartHub into the hands of a teacher in our nationwide crowdfunded pilot program.  Teachers across the nation are being encouraged to set up micro campaigns on our website and then use the power of the crowd to get their friends, family, and fellow educators to help fund their micro campaign. You too can donate to a teacher's micro campaign at www.golumos.com/fundateacher or you can simply pledge and we will apply your donation to a teacher who tried but was unable to reach the needed amount to get a SmartHub.  


The number one perk you will receive is the warm fuzzy feeling you get from knowing you are helping a students education. But here's the tangible stuff you get also:


Insider: $10 You'll get the inside scoop on everything we do here at Lumos through Indiegogo and email updates. You'll get invites to the shows we attend, as well as be eligible for our random giveaways to our loyal followers.


Stick To It: $30 
Since you ponied up more than our insider we are going to give you more. Not only will get what the insider does but you also get a sweet *top secret* bumper sticker to proudly show off. You may not get sneak peek now, but once you have it you'll know you did the right thing.


Shout It Out: $50 
Next level donating means a next level item. Obviously you're all about the SmartHub so we are going to help you shout it from the roof tops with this awesome shirt! Lets be honest, you've never seen a shirt this sweet.



Cap It All Off: $100
Hat's off to you! This will go a long way to help a teacher you may or may not know receive a SmartHub for their classroom. For showing the love you will also receive a top secret item, the Lumos hat.

<h2>          EZ-CHARGE...THE PRESENT... </h2>
<h2>           WHERE ARE WE TODAY!</h2>
<p>As an Engineer working on projects from super-sonic jets to satellite systems I started this project while living and working in Africa  to help deliver electricity to the more than 1 billion rural poor who have cellphones but no way to charge them.  I quickly found that addressing the global cellphone market with a way to charge their phones would benefit billions of people.  We’ve been working on <b>EZ-CHARGE</b> for almost 5 years and have reached significant milestones on our own. </p>
<h4><b>This is revolutionary and will change the way electricity can be provided.  </b></h4>
<ul>
<li><b>The device consists of three electronic circuits that work in harmony</b></li>
<li><b>Two of these circuits are completed, working and are already producing an output of electricity from the atmosphere.  </b></li>
<li><b>These two circuits have exceeded all expectations and the output is currently at nearly 70 volts. </b></li>
<li><b><b>Check out the video above and see how the current EZ-CHARGE prototype is working and the voltage that it generates.</b></b></li>
<li><b>For purposes of this first generation EZ-CHARGE for the cellphone  only 5 volts will be required.</b></li>
<li><b>Once the third and final circuit is completed the energy will circulate within the device. </b></li>
<li><b>The device will HARVEST, CONVERT AND STORE energy 24 hours a day and then will be available to charge your cellphone when attached.  </b></li>
<li><b>Once finalized the energy is stored within the unit and will release electricity recharging your cellphone in the same way as if it were plugged into a wall outlet.</b></li>
</ul>
<h3><b>And there is even more...</b></h3>
<ul>
<li>
<b>EZ-CHARGE</b> will not need to remain plugged into your cellphone all of the time.  But when you are not using your phone you will be able to just plug the USB cable in and <b>EZ-CHARGE</b> will be recharging your phone while in your pocket, purse, backpack or briefcase. </li>
<li>
<b>EZ-CHARGE </b>will never need to be plugged into a wall outlet.  It won't need a battery or sunny weather for it to work.</li>
<li>
<b>EZ-CHARGE has</b> a variety of slip-on cases to suit your lifestyle.  Some of these cases have already been designed but require tooling.</li>
<li>The basic <b>EZ-CHARGE</b> will come in a brushed case of durable ABS which will look very much like the prototype you see in the video as well as the prototype in the picture. </li>
<li>The prototype that is pictured and in the video contains the completed working circuits and the third and final circuit will be added to that existing case.  </li>
</ul>
<p><b>Just remember with or without a slip on case EZ-CHARGE is only the size of a credit card or hotel room key only thicker. </b></p>
<p><b><br/></b></p>
<p><b></b></p>
<p><b><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/55417/files/20130905141856-ROOM_KEY_WITH_YELLOW_CASE_VERSION_1_COPY__480_x_358_.jpg?1378415936"" src="""" style=""""/></b></p>
<b><i>Dazzling color slip on case for EZ-CHARGE is smaller than a hotel room key </i></b><p></p>
<h4><b>""...This will be a game changer!  More than just a cellphone charger it is an energy harvesting device with Global impact.""</b></h4>
<p><b>Nikola Tesla, inventor of AC electricity,  worked with harvesting energy from the air  in the early 1900's and has patents in this area.</b> We know this concept is very important which is why we decided to make a device that would charge a cellphone rather than attempting to provide electricity to houses or factories.  We believe that the companies and people that need this technology will embrace it.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>You should get really excited about the potential of EZ-CHARGE!</b></p>
<p><b>We are now in the final stages of completing the third circuit, additional case designs and tooling for the commercial product and production.  </b></p>
<h2>           FINAL DESIGN FOR EZ-CHARGE</h2>
<p>There is a simplicity in the overall <b>EZ-CHARGE</b> design.  The basic case houses the circuitry which enables the unit to harvest and store electricity.  The final <b>EZ-CHARGE</b> is scheduled to look close to the basic brushed silver ABS unit pictured below with the exception of the addition of our <b>EZ-CHARGE</b> logo which will be imprinted on the front of the case. </p>
<p>There are numerous reasons behind our decision to maintain the simplicity, the number one being to enable us to keep the pricing low for all consumers including the 1.5 billion rural poor.  They need this product but may not be able to afford a case with  more embellished housing.</p>
<p>With this in mind we began developing slip-on cases to appeal to numerous lifestyles.  It is our intention to continue designing and developing interesting and exciting slip-on cases to suit different personalities.  </p>
<p>The first step in this design process is to conceptualize the design, commit it to paper, create an early stage mock up followed by a final prototype.  Subsequent to the prototype tooling must be done for each design.  This is the stage that we are currently in for the above slip-on case designs.  </p>
<h2>                               PRODUCTION PLAN</h2>
<p>Once funding is completed the Timeline is as follows:  The overall projection from finalizing the third circuit to early production of <b>EZ-CHARGE</b> for our backers is 6 - 9 months.  Several tasks will be going on at the same time and will overlap.  Below is an estimate of time for each stage but some stages are running concurrently not consecutively, </p>
<ul>
<li><b>Purchase necessary software and hardware to complete the third and final circuit.  Finalize testing      120 days</b></li>
<li><b>Tooling designs for proprietary components    30 days              </b></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Finalize injection mold for EZ-CHARGE basic casing  45 days</b></li>
<li><b>Connector cables/adapters final design approval  30 days</b></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Finalize mold designs for initial slip on cases. 45 days</b></li>
<li><b>Finalize packaging design for EZ-CHARGE    45 days </b></li>
<li><b>Initial pre-production  run and packaging for project backers  60 days following completion of above stages </b></li>
<li><b>Shipping EZ-CHARGE to backers  Projected July 2014 or sooner</b></li>
</ul>
<p><b>It is important to realize that the energy harvesting technology that will allow you to charge your cellphone without main power, battery power or solar could be extrapolated into providing electricity for many other uses.</b></p>
<p>This is a <b>revolution</b> and as <b>backers</b> you can be an <b>integral part </b>of it.</p>
<p> Once the early pre- production has been completed  we intend to market <b>EZ-CHARGE</b> globally using an extensive distribution network that will begin with the big box retailers. </p>
<p>Backers will get <b>EZ-CHARGE </b>before anyone else.  That could be YOU! Be a part of this exciting project!</p>
<p><b>           EZ-CHARGE CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN YOUR LIFE!</b></p>
<p><b>With your trust and support we can bring EZ-CHARGE into all of our lives and change the way we receive electricity.  </b></p>
<h3><b>YOU  LOVE IT...YOU  BACK IT ... YOU   HAVE IT...FIRST!</b></h3>
<h2>           CUSTOMIZE YOUR EZ-CHARGE!</h2>
<p>You will be able to customize your basic <b>EZ-CHARGE</b> with one of the variety of amazing slip-on cases we are currently developing.  These cases will give your <b>EZ-CHARGE</b> a unique personality and can suit your lifestyle.  You can have one or many just remember they are the size of your credit card only thicker.  </p>

MAKE EZ-CHARGE A REALITY!   
                    
                      CRITICAL MASS....            

EZ-CHARGE is NOT science fiction but real technology.  Everyone with a cellphone needs this device and should want this device... so get behind this project and help us make this a reality for the world.  



 We think it is very important to  remind everyone about our decision on  funding. 


 Yes, we chose Flexible Funding with this  caveat: If we are close to our goal but not  there,  we will look to trim our budget and  cut costs wherever we can so that we can  finish and get the pre-production done  and EZ-CHARGE into your hands as  planned. 

 IF we don't get close then we are going to  return the money from our backers along  with a commitment to provide EZ-CHAR GE  to you at a reduced price once it IS  finished. 
By the way everyone if you are paying by Pay Pal the account name is correct as Georgene at Ultimate Change Coach. That is our Pay Pal account.  

As early believers and supporters we will make sure that you are the first ones to receive your EZ-CHARGE. You really have nothing to lose except the small fee from Indiegogo so help us get to our goal.  




             WHAT IS EZ-CHARGE?

EZ-CHARGE is a portable device that will transform atmospheric energy into usable electricity. It will harvest, store and then provide the electricity which you can use to charge your cellphone without the need for main power, battery power, solar power or hand cranking. It basically  provides FREE electricity!
EZ-CHARGE is a Technology project with a clear end and a targeted completion date when EZ-CHARGE  will be produced and shipped. Where we are today with the working PROTOTYPE can be seen on the VIDEO above.   You can check out how the final design is envisioned  in Final Product Design below as compared to the existing prototype as shown in the video.  


Untapped forces of nature provide us with the opportunity to change our world!


Benjamin Franklin 1752 Experiments with ways to capture electricity from the air


EZ-CHARGE is an energy harvesting device that will pump electricity from the air.  It goes wherever you go, whenever you go and will be  there when YOU need it.
                     WHO NEEDS EZ-CHARGE?
Everyone with a cellphone will need this amazing product from:

The businessman or woman on the go
The Athlete on a run 
The Cyclist
The Rock Climber
School kids who use up their batteries with texting & social media
Someone on a country walk
Busy mom on the go
The more than 1 Billion people Worldwide without electricity


The video below demonstrates the actual working circuitry of EZ-CHARGE.   The 1.5 volt battery is temporary and replaces the third circuit which will be built with the funds raised from this campaign.  The 1.5 volt battery produces ONLY 1.5 - 1.6 volts and is not responsible in any way for the nearly 69 volts that you will see in this demonstration.   The 68.5 volts....70 volts less the input of 1.5 volts...is from the air that surrounds us.  Check out the demonstration!



                            WHY EZ-CHARGE?

EZ-CHARGE will never need to be plugged into a wall outlet
EZ-CHARGE won't  need a battery
It won't need sunny weather to work
EZ-CHARGE  will go where you go
Lightweight and portable it  attaches easily to your cellphone
EZ-CHARGE is smaller than a credit card only thicker

""...This is a game changer.""
""...Imagine never have to plug your cellphone into a wall outlet, use batteries to charge it or depend upon solar power ever again.""
With EZ-CHARGE you will  have electricity that goes where you go, whenever you go...even if you are hanging from a rock.


Power in your pocket when and where you need it! 


""...Anyone who has done any research into transforming atmospheric energy into electricity knows how incredibly important this is to every aspect of our lives.""  
EZ-CHARGE  is portable and lightweight for ease in carrying in your hand and can be slipped into a pocket, handbag, briefcase or backpack. 
""...people are going to love this product."" 

 
EZ-CHARGE connects up easily to your cellphone

EZ-CHARGE is the Insurance Policy for your Communication needs!







          EZ-CHARGE...THE PRESENT... 
           WHERE ARE WE TODAY!
As an Engineer working on projects from super-sonic jets to satellite systems I started this project while living and working in Africa  to help deliver electricity to the more than 1 billion rural poor who have cellphones but no way to charge them.  I quickly found that addressing the global cellphone market with a way to charge their phones would benefit billions of people.  We’ve been working on EZ-CHARGE for almost 5 years and have reached significant milestones on our own. 
This is revolutionary and will change the way electricity can be provided.  

The device consists of three electronic circuits that work in harmony
Two of these circuits are completed, working and are already producing an output of electricity from the atmosphere.  
These two circuits have exceeded all expectations and the output is currently at nearly 70 volts. 
Check out the video above and see how the current EZ-CHARGE prototype is working and the voltage that it generates.
For purposes of this first generation EZ-CHARGE for the cellphone  only 5 volts will be required.
Once the third and final circuit is completed the energy will circulate within the device. 
The device will HARVEST, CONVERT AND STORE energy 24 hours a day and then will be available to charge your cellphone when attached.  
Once finalized the energy is stored within the unit and will release electricity recharging your cellphone in the same way as if it were plugged into a wall outlet.

And there is even more...


EZ-CHARGE will not need to remain plugged into your cellphone all of the time.  But when you are not using your phone you will be able to just plug the USB cable in and EZ-CHARGE will be recharging your phone while in your pocket, purse, backpack or briefcase. 

EZ-CHARGE will never need to be plugged into a wall outlet.  It won't need a battery or sunny weather for it to work.

EZ-CHARGE has a variety of slip-on cases to suit your lifestyle.  Some of these cases have already been designed but require tooling.
The basic EZ-CHARGE will come in a brushed case of durable ABS which will look very much like the prototype you see in the video as well as the prototype in the picture. 
The prototype that is pictured and in the video contains the completed working circuits and the third and final circuit will be added to that existing case.  

Just remember with or without a slip on case EZ-CHARGE is only the size of a credit card or hotel room key only thicker. 



Dazzling color slip on case for EZ-CHARGE is smaller than a hotel room key 
""...This will be a game changer!  More than just a cellphone charger it is an energy harvesting device with Global impact.""
Nikola Tesla, inventor of AC electricity,  worked with harvesting energy from the air  in the early 1900's and has patents in this area. We know this concept is very important which is why we decided to make a device that would charge a cellphone rather than attempting to provide electricity to houses or factories.  We believe that the companies and people that need this technology will embrace it.

You should get really excited about the potential of EZ-CHARGE!
We are now in the final stages of completing the third circuit, additional case designs and tooling for the commercial product and production.  
           FINAL DESIGN FOR EZ-CHARGE
There is a simplicity in the overall EZ-CHARGE design.  The basic case houses the circuitry which enables the unit to harvest and store electricity.  The final EZ-CHARGE is scheduled to look close to the basic brushed silver ABS unit pictured below with the exception of the addition of our EZ-CHARGE logo which will be imprinted on the front of the case. 
There are numerous reasons behind our decision to maintain the simplicity, the number one being to enable us to keep the pricing low for all consumers including the 1.5 billion rural poor.  They need this product but may not be able to afford a case with  more embellished housing.
With this in mind we began developing slip-on cases to appeal to numerous lifestyles.  It is our intention to continue designing and developing interesting and exciting slip-on cases to suit different personalities.  
The first step in this design process is to conceptualize the design, commit it to paper, create an early stage mock up followed by a final prototype.  Subsequent to the prototype tooling must be done for each design.  This is the stage that we are currently in for the above slip-on case designs.  
                               PRODUCTION PLAN
Once funding is completed the Timeline is as follows:  The overall projection from finalizing the third circuit to early production of EZ-CHARGE for our backers is 6 - 9 months.  Several tasks will be going on at the same time and will overlap.  Below is an estimate of time for each stage but some stages are running concurrently not consecutively, 

Purchase necessary software and hardware to complete the third and final circuit.  Finalize testing      120 days
Tooling designs for proprietary components    30 days              


Finalize injection mold for EZ-CHARGE basic casing  45 days
Connector cables/adapters final design approval  30 days


Finalize mold designs for initial slip on cases. 45 days
Finalize packaging design for EZ-CHARGE    45 days 
Initial pre-production  run and packaging for project backers  60 days following completion of above stages 
Shipping EZ-CHARGE to backers  Projected July 2014 or sooner

It is important to realize that the energy harvesting technology that will allow you to charge your cellphone without main power, battery power or solar could be extrapolated into providing electricity for many other uses.
This is a revolution and as backers you can be an integral part of it.
 Once the early pre- production has been completed  we intend to market EZ-CHARGE globally using an extensive distribution network that will begin with the big box retailers. 
Backers will get EZ-CHARGE before anyone else.  That could be YOU! Be a part of this exciting project!
           EZ-CHARGE CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN YOUR LIFE!
With your trust and support we can bring EZ-CHARGE into all of our lives and change the way we receive electricity.  
YOU  LOVE IT...YOU  BACK IT ... YOU   HAVE IT...FIRST!

than we originally thought
Every user had the same problem.
We
were stunned of the extent!

Simple
internet search on the subject generated millions of results.


Some of them were terrifying. In
some cases the problem was listed as the tunnel carpal syndrome (the
worse form of the problem, some had to have surgery to resolve it). 


We started to  look for a solution.  

The first prototypes
were made from handy prototyping materials, with no coating, noisy and bulky designs.

With each iteration we've
increased the ergonomic comfort level. We were consultation from several orthopedists, whose inputs helped to shape the product.





We tried a vast variety of materials, shapes and coatings. Finally
we made a successful prototype with optimal form and most important – minimal
weight.


Now we are ready to
present our final product, which was created through the ingenuity of our team.








Moshotus ergonomic device makes working and gaming more comfortable.
Moshotus is compatible with all types of mice.
Moshotus facilitates hand movements, with minimal weight impact.

</div><p>What if <i>you could
give one dollar</i> and know that <b>an
Israeli soldier, on the battlefield,</b> will receive <u>tremendous inspiration</u>
and <u>spiritual strength</u> from your small donation?</p>
<p>If you want to <u>give inspiration, hope, and healing</u>
to the brave soldiers keeping Israeli men, women and children safe, please read
our story—and theirs.</p>
<p><b>The
Protective Edge Story</b></p>
<p>Battle is a time of bravery, fear, and closeness to God,
a time in which every moment lasts forever. It’s easy to imagine how vulnerable
a soldier feels.</p>
<p>Recently, Israeli soldiers from in Gaza contacted <a href=""http://nucampaign.org/en/Home.aspx"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Nucampaign</a>,
a global community of Ambassadors for Israel, and asked if they could be sent pocket-sized
copies of Tikkun Haklali. </p>
<p>Known as the Complete Remedy in English, Tikkun Haklali
is a collection of ten Psalms specially chosen by Rebbe Nachman of Breslov for their
spiritual healing and protection. <i>Israelis
from a wide variety of backgrounds have heard of the power of these soul-stirring
Psalms.</i></p>
<p>Nucampaign contacted us, <a href=""http://www.breslov.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Breslov Research Institute</a>, and we immediately <i>printed and sent out 3000 Protective-Edge
Special-Edition of Tikkun Haklali </i>which also contain inspiring quotes and other
prayers. The amazing people at Nucampaign generously paid for the printing costs and we published the books for free. </p><p>When <b>the soldiers received the
books, <i>5000 of their comrades asked if
they could receive copies, too!</i></b></p>
<p>There are literally thousands of <i>additional </i>IDF soldiers who could benefit from the <i>chizuk</i>,
spiritual strength, this gift could bring. And we want to send them copies—fast.
</p>
<p>That’s why we’re asking <b>you to make these spiritual benefits come true for the courageous young
men of the IDF.</b></p>
<p>We’re hoping we raise enough funds for <u>18,000 copies
the Protective-Edge Special- Edition of Tikkun Haklali</u>. But we don’t think
the soldiers should have to wait 30 days until our fundraising campaign ends. </p>
<p>That’s why, <u>each time we reach the 5000 dollar donation
mark,</u> we’ll immediately call our printer in Israel and he’ll do a rush job.</p>
<p>Nucampaign and Breslov Research Institute will make sure
the soldiers get the special edition pocket-sized books—right away.</p>
<p>Now, it’s true that <b>you
only need to donate one dollar</b> to give a soldier this soul-uplifting
edition. But if you are able to <b>answer
the plea of 10 soldiers with a $10 donation, or 50 soldiers with a $50
donation,</b> we’ll be able to reach our goals and get more books out to them
all the more quickly.</p>
<p>Won’t you join us and <b>send a spiritual edge to the brave Israelis serving in Protective Edge?</b> </p><p><b>UPDATE 8/4</b></p><p><i>We received word that soldiers are interested in receiving the Hebrew editions of The Gentle Weapon and The Empty Chair in addition to the Protective-Edge Special-Edition Tikkun Haklali, so we will be distributing these as well. Donations will go towards any of these tremendously inspiring books. </i><br/></p><p><b>Ceasefire Distribution Plan Update</b><br/></p><p><b></b></p><p>Thank God the ceasefire in Israel seems to be holding and many of the reservists have returned home. We hope and pray for continued peace.</p><p>At the same time, there are still tens of thousands of soldiers near the border, and Israel may maintain a permanent self-defense buffer zone along the Gaza border. While we are still in the midst of printing and distributing booklets, the future movement of the soldiers is uncertain. We are therefore expanding our distribution efforts country-wide and offering IDF soldiers and possibly families adversely affected by the war, the opportunity to also benefit by receiving Tikkun Haklalis, and/or The Gentle Weapon and The Empty Chair booklets.</p>Should you have any questions or concerns, please feel free to contact me: <a href=""mailto:yossik@breslov.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">yossik@breslov.org</a> or <a rel=""noopener nofollow"">(732) 534-7263</a>.<br/><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/758260/files/20140731205916-Gil_Bashe_60.jpeg?1406865556"" src="""" style=""""/></p><b>A personal note from Gil Bashe, Chair of the Breslov

<b><br/></b><p>Dear Supporter of Israeli Soldiers,</p>
<p>As a former IDF Staff Sargent and combat medic during the
first Lebanon War 1982-1985, I served in an IDF paratrooper unit in Lebanon six
times. I also participated in the battles of Sultan Yacob and Sidon. </p>
<p>When I hear about the bravery, faith, and sadly, the
losses, of the Israeli soldiers fighting in Gaza, today, I close my eyes and am
taken back to my service.  Although no
one can know what lies in the heart of another, the possible exception is a
fellow soldier. </p>
<p>Soldiers know that inspiration can be in short supply
when you’re facing mortal danger. And that Heavenly inspiration like that found
in Tikkun Haklali might mean the difference between despair and hope. </p>
<p>Thank you for joining me and sending our young men
faith—in the form of this inspiring edition of Tikkun Haklali and other
prayers. These young men might not know your name, but they will appreciate having

 are many reasons.  First, often there simply are no THT components 
available to perform as you need - they do not make them. So, the only 
way to get the component on your Bread Board is by using the SMD version
 - there is no other.  Second, often it is important that your prototype
 is as representative of the final product as possible - some SMD 
components do not have an identical equivalent in a THT package - so, 
again, you need the real thing - you need that particular SMD component 
on your Bread Board.  So, Awesome PCB is the perfect link from SMD components to your Bread Board.<br/><br/><b>The puzzling  was how easily and efficiently make implement SMD components for a prototype made on Bread Board.</b><br/><br/><b><span>In such a way born</span> Awesome PCB. </b>        <br/><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1256188/files/20150228095401-AwesomePCB_TOP_BOTTOM_round.png?1425146041"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><ul>

<br/><p>Probably
 everyone who has made a prototype using a Bread Board knows how quickly
 their elegant circuit design can look like a tangled mess of wires and 
unidentifiable components.  Awesome PCB can help reduce the clutter by 
providing a foundation for small modules with some internal integration.  A few Awesome PCBs on your Bread Board, and suddenly it can look 
manageable.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1275873/files/20150307062422-awesomePCB_main_round_new_aproach1.png?1425738262"" src="""" style=""width: 561.191px;height: 314px;""/></p>
<br/>
<p>   And because you can write on Awesome PCBs, you will no 
longer need to wonder what a component is - all can be clear.  If you 
have a capacitor, inductor, LED or temperature sensor on an Awesome PCB,
 you will no longer need to wonder at the value - you add the ID, and 
every time you use it, you will not loose it!  <br/></p>

</ul><p></p></div>","If you miss the campaign you can get latest version of Awesome PCB with 7 different type of packages 0402, 0603, 0805, 1206, SOT23, SOT223, SOT323 here.What's This All About?Awesome PCB makes it easy for you to place SMD components on your Bread Board.Why SMD on your Bread Board?There
 are many reasons.  First, often there simply are no THT components 
available to perform as you need - they do not make them. So, the only 
way to get the component on your Bread Board is by using the SMD version
 - there is no other.  Second, often it is important that your prototype
 is as representative of the final product as possible - some SMD 
components do not have an identical equivalent in a THT package - so, 
again, you need the real thing - you need that particular SMD component 
on your Bread Board.  So, Awesome PCB is the perfect link from SMD components to your Bread Board.The puzzling  was how easily and efficiently make implement SMD components for a prototype made on Bread Board.In such a way born Awesome PCB.         
The first so small and powerful PCB, with so many different packages.
       0603, 0805, 1206, SOT23 and SOT223

Makes it easy to determine component value


Easily identify the component on the circuit diagram


Component once used can be reused in future projects 

                 

Pins or sockets can be used depend of used platform 


Directly connect to Arduino or other development board 


Awesome PCB allowed to make wide variety of connections on PCB

Single connectionsSerial connectionsParallel connectionsSOT23 connectionsSOT223 connections ... others depend on your creativity!What else is Awesome with Awesome PCB?
Probably
 everyone who has made a prototype using a Bread Board knows how quickly
 their elegant circuit design can look like a tangled mess of wires and 
unidentifiable components.  Awesome PCB can help reduce the clutter by 
providing a foundation for small modules with some internal integration.  A few Awesome PCBs on your Bread Board, and suddenly it can look 
manageable.


   And because you can write on Awesome PCBs, you will no 
longer need to wonder what a component is - all can be clear.  If you 
have a capacitor, inductor, LED or temperature sensor on an Awesome PCB,
 you will no longer need to wonder at the value - you add the ID, and 
every time you use it, you will not loose it!  
Awesome PCB simplify
testing phase,  
simplify exchanging components in your projects,
 decrease time to market.

Risks & Challenges
Your opinion matters to me. Right now stage of the project is like was presented. Main formula of design will be kept, but some adjustment will be performed. Therefore I'm asking you what do you think? What can be done better? What can be improved?Regarding risk, it is an unavoidable and an inescapable fact of each project. It is no different for this project, which is being carried out. In case of this project the main source of the risk is reliable supplier of the PCB.Through my professional work, I develop network reliable suppliers of the PCB, who are able to meet time and high quality standards. PCB will be performed by the European supplier.Second type of risk is fulfil the time-line regarding delivery - mainly it depends on the interest. Nonetheless I am determinate to fit in the given time frame. All shipments will be insured.

Why I need your help?Please help me spread an idea of the smart prototype with Awesome PCB.Support this project and help bring it to a wider community of electronics. Thank you for your help and support.PerkStretch goals# STAGE 1 - 1700$

<p>iRemoteControl has the ability to automatically control your existing remotes and devices, at the same time combine all your remotes into the iPhone.  Also makes a great backup incase you lose your keys or Remote!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Hello, my name is Mike Lee. About 3 years ago, I had this idea to replace remote control car key fobs using the iPhone, but I sat on it waiting for someone else to do it. Someone did, but after about $150.00 in materials, and the need for a professional to install it (which probably cost hundreds too), I thought it was time for me to come up with a better solution.</p>
<p>My version would be simple, easy to install by ANYONE, and most of all, cheap considering the alternatives. While I was designing my prototype, I thought, why stop at car remotes? Wouldn't it be great to control anything that has a button: garage doors, home alarms, you name it! We could deploy this across any industry! Not only are you in control of anything, you can improve <strong>existing </strong>devices.</p>

<h2><strong>How do you use it?</strong></h2>
<p>It's as easy as 1...2......hum... where's the 3?</p>
<p>First, the actuator is held to anything with industrial double-sided tape.  Just stick the actuator onto anything.  If you have 3 buttons on your car remote, you'll probably want to use 3 actuators and so on.</p>
<p>Second, download and install the app from the app store.  Take a picture of whatever device you are planning to control. Assign the virtual buttons on top of the picture you just took, and you are done!</p>

<p>Each Bluetooth Hub can be battery powered, car powered or home powered.  Because it's Bluetooth, you don't need to worry about configuring network settings.  It'll just connect.  It will be small and portable so you can take it with you.  </p>
<p>The more Bluetooth Hubs you have, the more you can control: Just swipe between devices!  As you can imagine, you can have all your devices, once scattered about, all in your iPhone!  The possibilities are limitless!</p>

And some even require you do register yourself on a central server.This project will offer an easy to use solution that uses properly implemented high grade cryptography.I am a very experienced software developer doing cryptography for 25 years now. 20 years ago I and a fellow student have developed our first phone encryptor LC-1:It was really not something you would want to carry around with you. Today it is possible to have an even higher level of security with nearly every available smartphone:The usage is very easy: at the beginning of the phone call just ask if your conversation partner sees the same 3 words on their display. If this is the case, then you can be sure that this line is secure.There is also no need to register on a central server, you only have to install it on both smartphones.Right now the app does the encryption right but is not very user friendly. We need your help to turn it into a better product, that everyone can use. We want to make secure phone calls are as normal as unencrypted phone calls are today.What we will do after funding succeedsWe plan to extend the app significantly, so that it becomes easier to use and more stable:
reduce the data usage
improve the voice quality for bad connections
make it easier to place a phone call, redial etc.
Also the security will be improved to protect the device against several attacks:

add plausible deniability to protect against being forced to hand out the key

add perfect forward secrecy to protect against decryption after the device has been compromised

add one time pads to provide the only mathematically proven ""unbreakable encryption"" for those who want to go the extra mile

The risk of failure is very low as the techniques are well established and only have to be implemented properly.As a backer, you will get a copy (or more) of the Android app once it's done, that you can use to do encrypted phone calls.If we exceed the goal, new features will be added. On the list are things like
support for iOS and WindowsPhone
text messages
""off the record"" messages
get the app audited by an accredited laboratory
If you have a good idea what to add, please send it to us! If we don't reach the goal, we will still make the app, but it will take significantly longer to complete it.The resultThe Snowden papers have showed that mass surveillance is not a dystopian fantasy but hard reality. Even lawyers cannot be sure that they are not wiretapped. The recent data scandals have showed again, that it is too often very easy to break into a private conversation with just a little efford.But even if you ""don't have anything to hide"", there are people in other countries that face the death penalty for doing nothing more then placing a phone call. This project will give them means to protect them and make it harder for governments to oppress their people.If you want to helpPlease share the link to this project with others. Educate them, that spying on a conversation is way too easy today. Tell them that secure and easy to use cryptography will be available soon and will only require a simple smartphone.Thank you!UpdatesUpdate 1The app does not rely on Android's ""SecureRandom"" alone. Instead if uses several sources of randomness to generate the encryption keys. I've uploaded a demo of the random number generator here:http://www.huwig.de/phone.apkIf you are interested, you can get the source of the RNG on GitHub.",2.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Coco Lin is a sales manager of our comany.She is a lovely girl who like to travel and take photos very much!She live in GuangDong province,south of China,where never snow after she was born.In order to see the snow for the first time,she flight to Xi'an last winter,northwest of China.After waiting for almost 1 week,the snow finally came.She was so excited to run in the snow and make a snowman.Of course she took a lot photos,most of them are selfie.She was very happy as a little kid in the snow,soon after dark she was ready to go back home, she found that her wallet had lost with all the cards and money.She searched frantically everywhere.Very Fortunately,she got everything back after searching more than 1 hours!But she got cold!</p>
<p>After that, she was wondering if we could invent a device that can remind her when she lost the small things,also can she find them on her smartphone very easy,of course,if it could remote control the smartphone focus to take photos by herself,that would be great! </p>
<p>Great idear!Right?And we need to make it to become a reality to help people like Coco.With almost 1 year market research,design and r&amp;d,this great product BS1 was born!</p>

 Operating System is a Linux brand made by Debian that has been 
customized for optimal security. Some of the features that have been 
added and modified the Linux kernel (core):</p>
<ul>
<li>Anti-exploitation modules high tuned for OS attacking resistance.  </li>
<li>Anti-forensic capabilities in the case of seizure by law enforcement. </li>
<li>Cryptographically enhanced modules for file memory and access modes.
 Boot and Full disk encryption and Cold Boot Attack patched. </li>
<li>Isolation: Each service runs in an isolated environment, to prevent 
security bugs that may affect the rest of the system and services. </li>
<li>Optimization: Proper service configuration helps to avoid possible vector attacks of unused libraries. </li>
<li>Backward/downward compatible: New security standards can receive, read, view or play older standards or formats.</li>

But do you trust politicians? We sure don’t.COMMUNITY
 CUBE is a technology that makes protecting your privacy easy.Our device is a plug and play, open source, energy efficient server designed from the ground up with your security and privacy in mind. You can trust COMMUNITY CUBE, because all our hardware and software is open source and available for review.This is a one-time-payment product with no hidden or recurring fees.Our one-to-all, all-to-one model provides an ideal platform which can provide any Internet service you might need, while eliminating the risk of being 
spied on by  government agencies, big corporations, hackers and malicious software.The Internet is full of ""free"" services.Most are offered by large corporations that work for the common good. Right?Come on. You know better.They are giving you something for “free” because they want something in return - your personal private information. By burying the details in their terms and conditions page, they are in fact hiding their nefarious intentions.We operate exactly the opposite.Because
 we integrate into each COMMUNITY CUBE a carefully selected  security 
audited services, you no longer need to depend on the good intentions of
 these big corporations.Each COMMUNITY CUBE comes with the following functionality:
Cage OS, a secured open operating system 
A decentralized anonymous Search Engine with administrator rights.
A filter-connector for your Social Networks in one single place.
Secure decentralized video conferences.
A secure Storage System with collaborative tools 
Transparent Email encryption for your actual email.
Anonymous web traffic enforcer
Ad-blocker, intrusion prevention system, anti-virus and anti-tracking technology for your web browsing.
The
 development of COMMUNITY CUBE services offers independence from any 
Internet authority, the cloud, corporation or government while educating
 users actively about data security, privacy and data disaster.34% of those who are aware of the surveillance programs have taken at least one step to shield their information from the government or hackers.Our goal is to integrate decentralized and collaborative open source tools with a focus on privacy and resilience. There
 are literally thousands of developers working every day to develop the 
code we use and is totally trustworthy. Not only have they have made 
this a success, but the millions of users prove the value of the open 
source we developed.The development of Community Cube services offers independence from any Internet authority, corporation or government agency while educating users about data security, privacy and data disaster survival.Community Cube is built on open-source hardware, and its operating system and features are built on free and open-source software (FOSS). Community Cube uses the boards ODROID-XU3 Lite from Hardkernel, which is 99% open, and you can run any Linux based operating system on it. You can find the electronic schema and here our 3d design.Open source hardware is constructed using design and development related information that is offered freely and publicly accessible, includes schematic diagrams, code, parts lists, construction parameters and documentation. 
If you don’t hack/root it, then you don’t own it.
We build a decentralized distributed grid where Community Cube is the physical hardware layer. Users get a citizen-fueled infrastructure.In technical words , to protect you, Community Cube does:
Filtering virus, exploits malware, ads , bad IP-sources and bad content.
Decentralizing the services (doing impossible to apply big data to you )
 Open authentication (dissolve legal relation between user and name-ip), Dark-nets (anonymisation of IP)
Forcing encryption for all communications and data storage and in rest.
Filtering the data that expose you, like scripts,cookies, browser info,etc.
COMMUNITY CUBE is designed to be robust and versatile.You can connect your COMMUNITY CUBE to the network in the way that best suits you.We support both cabled and wireless connections to your devices. Each COMMUNITY CUBE comes with four network interfaces which are configured as follows: 2 Wireless and 2 Cabled Ethernets. Are
 you outdoors? You can use our universal USB battery pack and any 
outdoor Internet connection (like 3G) to continue securing your 
communications.The following diagram shows 2 different ways of connecting your COMMUNITY CUBE:
Once connected to the network, your data is always waiting for you.Whether
 you are at home, in the office, or on the go, you can reach your data 
and use decentralized services, with absolute control, total privacy and
 invencible anonymity. 
With COMMUNITY CUBE you effectively create a quarantine zone which 
constitutes an isolated sub-network that adds an additional layer of 
security. If you are running a publicly accessible web server this is especially important.
Cage
 Operating System is a Linux brand made by Debian that has been 
customized for optimal security. Some of the features that have been 
added and modified the Linux kernel (core):

Anti-exploitation modules high tuned for OS attacking resistance.  
Anti-forensic capabilities in the case of seizure by law enforcement. 
Cryptographically enhanced modules for file memory and access modes.
 Boot and Full disk encryption and Cold Boot Attack patched. 
Isolation: Each service runs in an isolated environment, to prevent 
security bugs that may affect the rest of the system and services. 
Optimization: Proper service configuration helps to avoid possible vector attacks of unused libraries. 
Backward/downward compatible: New security standards can receive, read, view or play older standards or formats.

There's a initial script to modify a Debian Wheezy and convert it into a CageOS:https://github.com/CommunityCube   You can read more in www.cageos.org
Imagine all the important information you have stored on the hard drive of your computer. You are just one hardware failure away from disaster.Centralized models like cloud storage such as Drop box and Go0gle Drive or normal self hosting like a hard disk present a variety of risks for its users, including:
Data kidnapping: A real example was Mega. (FBI closed it in 2009). 
Disaster: Your external hard disks fail or stolen. (no disaster recovery) 
Privacy: You're at risk of having your data hacked and stolen if it’s not encrypted.
COMMUNITY CUBE is much more powerful.In our decentralized system your valuable information is encrypted three times:1. Before it even leaves your computer, in the web browser
2. In the collaboration tool before the data goes to the hard disk
3. When backing up to the grid, the slices will also be encrypted. The
 decentralized (i2p) version of Tahoe-LAFS-Grid (with protections 
against Sybil attacks and upload Dodos) is a new way to make your data 
indestructible. A grid splits your files up into little pieces, 
encrypts them and spreads them out geographically, making it immune to 
any disaster or service outage.Consider the following diagramWith COMMUNITY CUBE you control what you share with people and how you share it with other people and synchronize shared content and collaborated tools 
automatically. You can share not just single files through links,
 but a complete set of folders, contacts, agendas, and collaboration 
information with single or multiple cubes at one time then allowing 
upgrades of the set of collaboration data in real time automatically and
 anonymously.You can also sync your home Community Cube with all of your portable devices to have the same files and receive the same alerts in real time.If someone steals your cube or for some reason it is destroyed, you 
can simply buy a replacement COMMUNITY CUBE server and recover your lost
 data automatically from the Grid. In minutes you’re up and running again!The following diagram illustrates the different layers of data encryption that COMMUNITY CUBE provides:
We don’t mince words.Centralized social networks like Facebo0k and Tw1tter are selling your information. In
 fact, not only do they sell your information but they process, analyze,
 correlate and integrate your personal data with literally millions of 
independent data points that they either capture or purchase. In many ways they know more about you than even you do!COMMUNITY CUBE can act as a unified entry and outgoing point for all 
of your posts across social networks, as well as a filter for what is 
important to you. For example, do you hate cat videos? (Really? Can I get you some help?)You can use Community Cube to filter them out when it automatically imports posts from Facebook, Twitter, and Pinterest! You
 control your incoming and outgoing posts, and push your posts from a 
single place to everywhere with no need to open each social network in a
 separate tab.We aren’t asking you to give up on social media.Instead we offer you a way to be in the captain’s chair.Search engines are almost just as bad. Do you really want Google to keep a record of every whimsical search you make of the Internet?Consider the following diagram:We fixed this.With your COMMUNITY CUBE, you are in 
charge. Thanks to our open source search engine and control panel, you 
can manage everything about your on-line searches.You can configure almost anything to increase the quality of your results. More importantly, forget ads, forget positioning, and forget leaving logs about what and from where you searched.Just like search engines, most on-line communication programs also represent serious privacy issues.Consider the problems that entrusting everything to a corporate middleman can cause:Centrally authenticated chats and voice calls are open to supervision and control.Once again your COMMUNITY CUBE  saves the day!In our video conference model, we support two methods: a)
 With federated XMPP servers for authentication but perfect for 
discovering users outside the Community Cube network with security from 
the normal web. b) Unauthenticated and decentralized web browser
 video conferencing through anonymous links to create fast video 
conference rooms without third parties or middlemen involved.Did you know that all your emails are being read?And it’s not ONLY the government. Your email provider is also reading and analyzing every email you send!   They
 log your location, the time and related Internet searches and are 
constantly building an ever-more accurate profile of who you are.This must be stopped.COMMUNITY CUBE solves this problem without causing you any inconvenience.We encrypt emails transparently with the COMMUNITY CUBE web-mail front end. You don’t even need to change your actual email address. Our
 system uses a very simple but powerful integration with PGP which makes
 the content of your emails unreadable by your email provider or anyone 
else.Also, the IP from which this email was sent is completely cloaked.https://github.com/CommunityCube/debian-autoscript/issues There's an initial bounty plan at freedomsponsorsThe CPU  made by Hardkernel, but if we were 
over-funded, we can get enough power to work with providers to arrange 
for improvements in the hardware.  Every over-funded amount 
impacts the decreasing of production costs and increases the capacity of
 negotiating with providers and logistics. Also, it improves the software’s integration levels making life even easier for our users.After all, that’s what COMMUNITY CUBE is all about:  Security.  Privacy.   Ease of Use.

<p><b>Short Summary</b></p>
<p>             Welcome
to TechRent’s Indiegogo campaign!  TechRent
is the only service on the market that lets you rent whatever phone you want,
for as long as you like.  It was created
by two engineering students at UC San Diego who wanted to share their passion for
the tech industry with everyone else.  Buying a phone for full price is expensive and being locked into a contract for one phone is no fun.  That’s why we created TechRent,
the first affordable subscription service that lets you choose a new phone every
month.  With your help, we hope to
revolutionize the smartphone industry by making more phones available to more
people.  </p>
<p></p>

<br/>
<p><b>What We Need &amp; What You Get</b></p>
<p>             We are
launching our service on Indiegogo because we need a large initial launch in order to cover the expensive initial investment necessary to create a wide variety of smartphones for you to choose from.  We are asking for $10,000 because we believe this will
provide us with enough capital needed to create this large library of phones for you to choose from. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1456029380/ipcknxvsvmg9rxudqwqv.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>The <b>Premium Subscription</b> lets you choose
from all the latest smartphones such as the Samsung Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge, iPhone
6s Plus, and the LG V10, all for just $49.99 a month!</p>
<p>The <b>Basic Subscription</b> lets you choose from
smartphones that have been out for over a year, such as the Samsung Galaxy S6
and S6 Edge, iPhone 6, and the LG G3, all for just $29.99 a month!</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>How It Works</b></p><p><b></b></p><p>1. Sign-up for a basic or premium subscription.</p><p>2. Choose your phone.</p><p>3. We’ll ship it out to you within 5 days.</p><p>4. Your 30 day subscription begins when you get the phone.</p><p>5. You’ll have 3 weeks from that point to decide whether you want to keep the phone for another month or choose a new phone. <span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">After that, your decision will be locked in till the next month.</span></p><p>7.

             Welcome
to TechRent’s Indiegogo campaign!  TechRent
is the only service on the market that lets you rent whatever phone you want,
for as long as you like.  It was created
by two engineering students at UC San Diego who wanted to share their passion for
the tech industry with everyone else.  Buying a phone for full price is expensive and being locked into a contract for one phone is no fun.  That’s why we created TechRent,
the first affordable subscription service that lets you choose a new phone every
month.  With your help, we hope to
revolutionize the smartphone industry by making more phones available to more
people.  

                           

What We Need & What You Get
             We are
launching our service on Indiegogo because we need a large initial launch in order to cover the expensive initial investment necessary to create a wide variety of smartphones for you to choose from.  We are asking for $10,000 because we believe this will
provide us with enough capital needed to create this large library of phones for you to choose from. 

The Premium Subscription lets you choose
from all the latest smartphones such as the Samsung Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge, iPhone
6s Plus, and the LG V10, all for just $49.99 a month!
The Basic Subscription lets you choose from
smartphones that have been out for over a year, such as the Samsung Galaxy S6
and S6 Edge, iPhone 6, and the LG G3, all for just $29.99 a month!
 
How It Works1. Sign-up for a basic or premium subscription.2. Choose your phone.3. We’ll ship it out to you within 5 days.4. Your 30 day subscription begins when you get the phone.5. You’ll have 3 weeks from that point to decide whether you want to keep the phone for another month or choose a new phone. After that, your decision will be locked in till the next month.7. If you chose to get a new phone, we’ll get it to your doorstep by the 29th day.8. On the 30th day, you must mail your old phone back.9. Then the process repeats


           Once the site is fully up and running, users will also be able to buy a phone if they wish.  Every phone on our website can either be rented or bought.  Every month a phone gets rented, it either goes down in price by $30 for basic phones or $50 for premium phones.  In order for us to make money, prices start out a little higher than market prices, but decrease in price much faster than they regularly would.  For example, a new premium phone that starts out at $799 will go down in price by $50 each month it gets rented.  So in 6 months, the phone now costs just $499 to buy. 
             In terms of
cleanliness and security, once we get a phone back, all data is wiped clean and
erased.  Also, the phone itself is
physically cleaned with antibacterial wipes and UV light. 

Risks & Challenges
             - Covering our very large initial investment from building a large enough inventory of smartphones to create a wide variety for you to choose from.               - We are offering this service for the cheapest possible price.  As such, margins are very thin and leave little room for error on our part.             - This is our first

<p><b>Outreach in Ghana
</b></p>
<p>This past summer, members of the Walnut Valley Robotics
went to Ghana in hopes of inspiring students in nearby
villages to pursue an education in engineering. Team members
spent most of their time at the Avete-Anloga LA Basic School,
located in Anloga, Volta Region of Ghana. Though Walnut
Valley Robotics is a rookie team, many of the members have
previously been on First Lego League teams previously so
bringing LEGO Mindstorms to Ghana was an excellent way of
demonstrating simple programming and robotics.
</p>
<p>In the time that we were at the school, members instructed
students how to design, build, and program their own EV3
Robots. We also made it a priority to give teachers the
resources (Ev3 Kits) and instructions required to continue to

were able to establish relations with many nearby schools and

WILL TALK TO SMARTPHONES</b></p>
<p><b>by Dr. Bill Kent, CTO - Unmanned Aerial Systems, Inc.</b></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>At Unmanned Aerial Systems, Inc. over the last four years we have
succeeded in integrating advanced aerial photography into our UAV technology.
 There have been many quality and reliability improvements in these
cameras as well as impressive reductions in size, weight and power requirements
for them.  Over the same time period, cell
phone manufacturers have produced amazing improvements in their products.  2014 is the year to merge these two impressive
technology streams together through our “DRONES &amp; SMARTPHONES” project.</p>
<p>What is planned is for UAS, Inc. aerial
cameras to uplink precision, geo-referenced imagery directly to its secure website.  When the system
is fully operational, customers will have the software application to view stored imagery on their desktops, laptops,
tablets and smart phones.  </p>
<p>Before full integration of commercial
unmanned aerial vehicles in the U.S.
airspace begins in 2015, it is important to integrate the speed and convenience
of WiFi devices into the next
generation of commercial drone aircraft operations.  <b>Key
Strategy:  By making access to drone collected
imagery convenient and inexpensive by using the cell phone network and internet,
the operation of the drones can be provided by service companies that will be
able to focus on safety and privacy.</b> 
Commercial customers will only have to pay for the imagery they need,
making UAV use even more economical. 
The first markets are expected to include precision agriculture, news
and entertainment productions, search/rescue and public safety, security
surveillance, and pipeline safety operations.</p>
<p>When the WiFi downlink system is complete users will be able to view live drone missions on
their own devices. </p>

</p><p>Why do I need a TinyStic? Smartphones are great for checking email and running social media apps. But what about computing tasks that require a larger screen, keyboard and mouse? Today’s smartphones are 10X more powerful than the computers that we used to surf the web in 1999.  The TinyStic leverages the power that is already available on your smartphone and virtually eliminates the need for multiple computers.   If you are in your office working on a spreadsheet or a presentation on your laptop, then TinyStic provides for optimal portability by carrying a pocket sized device to continue your work at home.</p><p>Will the TinyStic work with my iPhone or iPad? Yes.  It works with iPhone, iPads, Android phones and Android tablets.</p><p>Why doesn’t The TinyStic work with Apple products?  Yes, iPhones and iPads</p><p>What's the difference between the TinyStic and Chromecast? Chromecast is great for streaming video to a monitor, but it does not allow for robust PC-like functionality. Chromecast will not convert your phone into a PC.</p><p>What’s the difference between the TinyStic and a VPN/Remote Server? a VPN app can be used to control a remote computer in a remote location. With the TinyStic, no computer is needed. Your smartphone is the computer.</p><p>What’s the difference between the TinyStic and Windows Surface? Windows Surface is a tablet that has PC functionality. The TinyStic converts your phone into a PC. </p><p>Is the TinyStic a wired docking station from the phone to the monitor? No,the TinyStic uses wireless communications.</p><p>What’s the difference between the TinyStic and Ubuntu? Ubuntu requires some systems administrative skills to install. Ubuntu requires you to reformat of your smartphone’s hard drive with their operating system. It’s not an easy task and it’s not easy to restore your original factory installation. The TinyStic uses a few simple apps to convert your phone into a PC.</p><p>After I install the TinyStic app, how easy is it to uninstall?

<p> </p>
<p>That was an short overview what iStart is and what it can be if you support this project!</p>
<p><strong>Some information about me:</strong></p>
<p>Im Kay Schneider , i worked as software developer on different companys. Based on software for the web. From Online Games to internet agencys wich build websites for large world wide operation companys.</p>
<p>In the year 2011 i was one of the top submitter on the ""google developer contest - doodle your way to gdd"".</p>
<p>After these 8 years experience i tink that it is time for something new. It is time to build an awesome software product wich is shipped mostly for free to all the people over the world. </p>
<p>And after the success i had in the google contest, where i have developed a demo for html5 fetaures with javascript, i mostly programmed at my free time in javascript. And also on work i started focus on javascript.</p>
<p>After im getting <strong>unemployed</strong> at the end of 2012 i started develop some apps for the chrome webstore. And in January 2013 i had the dream of an <strong>innovative new tab page for chrome,</strong> wich gives the user an easy access to everything he needs.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>
<strong>installed Apps</strong>, <strong>Bookmarks/links, and information in realtime from everywhere - live tiles - cloud control - </strong>
</h3>
<h3><strong> </strong></h3>
<p><strong><br/>Now i have developed ""iStart"" in an based Version</strong> wich gives the users an good userexperience. I released the Software at the end of january in 2013 after a week endless developing. After that, i released a few features so that it becomes more comfortable for the users. Im raising money to developing the features ""live tiles"", API, cloud control.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><a href=""https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/istart-new-tab-page-in-me/lkgdlmlmcijgnglfcophfjhafiafhkae"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">You can still see the base version in the chrome webstore</a></p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>It was a success. Without all features. There are over 3000  active users. Awesome. And now I need the support of the users for developing awesome features for you! Please help and keep this project alive!</strong></h3>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong><br/></strong>But to finished the work i need more time than i have. To ship iStart with all the features there is still need two months of hard work. </p>
<p> </p>
<h2>What we need and what you get?</h2>
<p>I need still 15k to developing iStart ready with all features and spread it to the world. The money will be used that i, Kay Schneider, can spend a fulltime development on iStart without having troubles with the billings like yet.</p>
<p>This helps me, to stay focused on the users needs and the new core features for iStart, ""live tiles"" and the API. And i need a little bit time to travel to some developer meetings to speak about iStart and the API ( that needs time and money I have time, but no money )</p>
<p>The money will be completly spend covering expenses during that time, and to spend a little bit money to build extra graphics for iStart <span>, as well as rewards for you, our supporters</span>.</p>
<p>If I dont reached the goal I spent so long fulltime development on iStart, as the money will it allow. But than it will take longer to bringing these cool features to life :(</p>
<p>Look at the things you will become when supporting my project :)</p>
<h2>More about the new features:</h2>
<p> </p>
<h3>live tiles:</h3>
<p>live tiles combined with the open API are a big and great feature for the users. With live tiles you become realtime information about everything, when there is an extension for that. Example. Currently im working on an weather live tile for iStart. Wich shows you with an nice animation the weather current and the forecast for the next few days direct on an tile!</p>
<p>Planed are extensions for iStart with these ""live tiles"" support:</p>
<p><strong>facebook feed, facebook pictures, instagram feed, twitter feed, news feed rss reader, mp3 NAT streaming information..... and much more</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<h3><strong>API:</strong></h3>
<p><strong><br/></strong>The API is an important feature for the live tiles. The live tiles are implemented by the API of iStart. Any of these cool and awesome live tile can be installed directly on the chrome webstore!</p>
<p>Thats really easy for the users. They search only for [istart] and see some extensions and apps that works for or with iStart.</p>
<p>The API allows also third party developers to integrate their own app or extension into iStart. So it become more relevant for the users, because they see the app everytime they opened a new tab!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Thats a great deal for other developers and for the users of iStart. With the API you can easy developing an live tile. Dont be scared about create an animation for the live tile. These features will be ready to use. Only provide your content and the rest will be done by iStart!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Its much more easyer as you think. If you have an working app or extension for chrome. You can add ""live tile"" support in 30minutes! ( If your app already using live data or using data by itself )</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>API for endusers, explanation: this feature allows other developers to create ""live tiles"" for you in a few minutes of time. So you will become more information on iStart for free!</h3>
<p> </p>
<h3>Cloud Control:</h3>
<p>Save all your settings in the cloud and that for free! Awesome and great feature. This will be shipped if i reached the goal at the end of 2013-04. This allows all users to save their settings on the cloud and sync it with all computers they use, ( i will love this feature also ).</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Im a one man - javascript ninja - mini company! I developing, bugfixing, support the users 7 days a week for happy users all over the world! I have the vision to create the best ""new tab page"" ever seen. Im a javascript expert and i know what it means to bring an project ready to fits the users need. Im open for feedback for everyone!

You can still see the base version in the chrome webstore
 
It was a success. Without all features. There are over 3000  active users. Awesome. And now I need the support of the users for developing awesome features for you! Please help and keep this project alive!
 
But to finished the work i need more time than i have. To ship iStart with all the features there is still need two months of hard work. 
 
What we need and what you get?
I need still 15k to developing iStart ready with all features and spread it to the world. The money will be used that i, Kay Schneider, can spend a fulltime development on iStart without having troubles with the billings like yet.
This helps me, to stay focused on the users needs and the new core features for iStart, ""live tiles"" and the API. And i need a little bit time to travel to some developer meetings to speak about iStart and the API ( that needs time and money I have time, but no money )
The money will be completly spend covering expenses during that time, and to spend a little bit money to build extra graphics for iStart , as well as rewards for you, our supporters.
If I dont reached the goal I spent so long fulltime development on iStart, as the money will it allow. But than it will take longer to bringing these cool features to life :(
Look at the things you will become when supporting my project :)
More about the new features:
 
live tiles:
live tiles combined with the open API are a big and great feature for the users. With live tiles you become realtime information about everything, when there is an extension for that. Example. Currently im working on an weather live tile for iStart. Wich shows you with an nice animation the weather current and the forecast for the next few days direct on an tile!
Planed are extensions for iStart with these ""live tiles"" support:
facebook feed, facebook pictures, instagram feed, twitter feed, news feed rss reader, mp3 NAT streaming information..... and much more
 
API:
The API is an important feature for the live tiles. The live tiles are implemented by the API of iStart. Any of these cool and awesome live tile can be installed directly on the chrome webstore!
Thats really easy for the users. They search only for [istart] and see some extensions and apps that works for or with iStart.
The API allows also third party developers to integrate their own app or extension into iStart. So it become more relevant for the users, because they see the app everytime they opened a new tab!
 
Thats a great deal for other developers and for the users of iStart. With the API you can easy developing an live tile. Dont be scared about create an animation for the live tile. These features will be ready to use. Only provide your content and the rest will be done by iStart!
 
Its much more easyer as you think. If you have an working app or extension for chrome. You can add ""live tile"" support in 30minutes! ( If your app already using live data or using data by itself )
 
API for endusers, explanation: this feature allows other developers to create ""live tiles"" for you in a few minutes of time. So you will become more information on iStart for free!
 
Cloud Control:
Save all your settings in the cloud and that for free! Awesome and great feature. This will be shipped if i reached the goal at the end of 2013-04. This allows all users to save their settings on the cloud and sync it with all computers they use, ( i will love this feature also ).
 
 
Im a one man - javascript ninja - mini company! I developing, bugfixing, support the users 7 days a week for happy users all over the world! I have the vision to create the best ""new tab page"" ever seen. Im a javascript expert and i know what it means to bring an project ready to fits the users need. Im open for feedback for everyone! You can still send me an mail and i answer 100% the most time in 5h :)
 
What you can do to help?
If you can, donate! :) That will be great. If you cant, spread the world with the indieGoGo share tools! Share it with your friends and the world. Because iStart is an nice part of Software wich needs support by users, friends of free Software and all other people around over the world wich share the passion about an ""new tab page"" that fits your needs and gives you an awesome user experience you neve seen bevore ( when its feature complete )

<p>We are pleased to announce this campaign to
introduce the Gladiator Glass Curved collection - the world’s first &amp; best titanium alloy
curved screen protector for the iPhone 6 with a ballistic grade tempered glass
screen cover inset.</p><p>&gt;&gt; NOTE ABOUT PERKS: Once the campaign is completed we will contact each contributor and get the size and color requirements. Those are not selectable on the Perk itself, but we will absolutely make sure we get you the right color and size for your order. &lt;&lt;</p>
<p><b>Our Newest Product:</b></p>
<p>The earliest screen protectors
were very thin sheets of film that, despite offering sufficient protection to
the phone screen, peeled and scratched easily and needed to be replaced often.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1431101183/ueqt08ulzwimnyhjpcmj.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><br/></p>
<p>Our new iPhone screen protector is
unique and different from any other screen protector that is currently
available in the market today. Rather than a thin, flimsy sheet of plastic to
protect your iPhone's screen, it utilizes a combination of fiber materials
including titanium alloy for the edges and is inset with specialized ballistic grade clear tempered glass. The back of the tempered glass is coated with a silicon adhesive making
installation easier and, when applied perfectly, will protect the screen
against fingerprints, dust and other particles that are hazardous to your
device. The surface offers an oleophobic coating to help minimize surface issues caused by finger prints.</p>
<p>Kyasi Gladiator Glass features
a CURVED edge to edge design which is unique when compared to similar products currently on the
market. This new screen protector for the iPhone 6 or 6 Plus has these curved edges made of titanium alloy that are made to
coordinate with the 3 primary iPhone colors. </p><p><img alt=""iPhone 6 Screen Protector Edge to Edge"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/003/671/856/68433920150c1d29bf1960e8fac4c298_original.jpg?v=1429899029&amp;w=700&amp;h=&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;q=92&amp;s=c69e0e680e33376d8b9e0e7ba40a67da"" src="""" style=""""/> <br/></p><p>The clear ballistic-grade tempered
glass is inset with precision to the middle of the protector to deliver
all of the benefits of advanced screen protection AND still protect those
delicate curves on the iPhone. This is same type of ballistic glass used for “bulletproof” glass applications - although it's thinner therefore we don't recommend shooting at your phone. </p><p>This is a unique protector that will not fade,
yellow, or peel away from the phone after time. </p>
<p><b>Features of Gladiator Glass include:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Screen clarity remains 99.9% clear. It is virtually
     invisible on the screen itself.</li>
<li>There is no loss of touch sensitivity. Your precision control remains intact.</li>
<li>The coordinating colors available add a stylish form of
     superior protection.</li>
<li>Works with a limited number of phone cases.<b> PLEASE NOTE:</b> TIGHT PHONE CASES or cases that slide on the edges may not be compatible with this protector since it expands to the edges. NOT ALL CASES WILL WORK. This is a decision that had to be made to accommodate the edge to edge design.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Impact:</b></p>
<p>iPhones are
expensive devices and it can be heartbreaking to find a huge scratch across
the screen of something so costly. A large scratch may even affect the
usability of a smartphone’s touchscreen. Cell phone and smartphone owners whose
devices spend a lot of time in pockets or purses should consider the benefits
of using Gladiator Glass.  By
simply adding the Gladiator Glass, the phone is instantly protected and therefore worth more in the
long run if you ever resell or trade it in. The screen is the biggest cost factor when it comes to replacement as well. Costs for iPhone 6 and 6 Plus can top $350.00USD to replace the screen in the event of breakage. This protector can be an inexpensive form of insurance.</p>
<p>Having Gladiator Glass on a phone can help protect it
up to 300% more from direct impact from drops than just having the screen alone and can be installed without any bubbles or
cloudiness to get in the way of the touch screen’s sensitivity or visibility.</p>

<p><b>Risks &amp; Challenges:</b></p>
<p>While we personally feel the risks and challenges
for this particular product are incredibly low, it is our responsibility to be
upfront and clear about any challenges or potential setbacks that may
potentially come our way. These could include: </p><ol>
<li>
<b>The product could fail in the long run. </b>- This risk is limited in our opinion because we have
     been producing tempered glass for a couple years. However, the
     introduction of the curved edges and titanium alloy add a new potential
     risk factor. In our testing the product has already held up for almost 3 months on 3 devices that we started testing at prototype phase. Consumers with tight fitting or enclosed cases may find that this glass is incompatible and therefore may not like it as an option.</li>
<li>
<b>Delays in production or shipping. </b>- This risk is normal with any product that is gearing
     up for a production run. The raw materials, production quality or other
     factors could delay shipments. International shipping adds an extra
     element of timing risk because clearing customs and other agencies can be
     unpredictable. We believe we can manage this risk, because we have created
     and imported/exported hundreds of products from concept to delivery prior
     to this particular product.</li>
<li>
<b>Playboy Mansion Launch Party </b>- The Playboy Halloween party has become a big tradition at the Playboy Mansion. We have attended a number of events there. However, it is not scheduled yet therefore a potential risk is that it will not happen this year. If that is the case we will provide full refunds to those that select this launch party perk or access to an alternative Playboy event at the discretion of the Perk buyer. We will not leave you without either an epic experience or your money back. Playboy is not associated with Kyasi or any of our products.</li>

great.  Our final Wowhoo launch to the public we want only 4 colors, 
possibly 5.  Help us and provide your favorites and any ideas or colors 
we are missing.

wireless charging will change the way you use your mobile device.   QI Wireless Chargers & The Automotive IndustryMajor
 wireless phone carriers are adopting the Qi wireless charging 
technology.  Additionally, many car manufactures are installing them in 
their 2014 and 2015 models. Manufactures include, but are not limited to
 the following: Jeep’s Cherokee, Toyota’s Avalon, Prius, Harrier, 
Mercedes-Benz, BMW, Volkswagen, Audi, as well as Porsche. Due to 
improved design and usability, our initial launch date has been revised 
from Jan 7th, to Feb 15th. We added approximately 8 mm in diameter to 
allow for a better internal design. The small revision to the Qi Wowhoo 
wireless charger yields a quicker charge and a more reliable product. We
 have quickened the charging speed to be approximately 10% faster than a
 stand-alone wall plug. That's a big jump considering were talking 
wireless charging.     Wowhoo Production TimelineWe
 are estimating about 8 weeks max for development and shipping. We have 
already knocked out 5 hard months of work on both our product and the 
packaging.  So far we have got most the kinks out, time for funding and 
the first full product production run.  We've very excited and hope all 
you backers are too. Our Wowhoo Qi charger is one of the few to hit the 
market. In our eye one of the highest quality and most eye appealing 
luxury charger on the market.  It will impress you, we assure that from 
packaging, product quality, and charging time. Everyone wants a Wowhoo 
we know already!!!

                                   STEP 2 (Adding the receiver above battery)




                                              STEP 3 (Closing back of case)




                                       2 Options for Apple Phones Below

 These are protective cases with Qi built into them.  You can either 
choose this option or the option below that plus into your iPhone and 
wraps around back below your case.  Your case hides the QI receiver.

available for Samsung phones soon.  If you pledge for a Samsung phone 
and we get our case sample in within the next 15-30 days you can of 
course choose the case or the receiver you add over your battery, your 
choice.   Were working on a full line of QI cases for all brands, these 
will be added and updated as we get samples, and you can choose from 
these. 

                                   
Iphone Qi receiver - Plug in and fold back behind your 
phone under your case. Very easy to use takes about 15 seconds to

<p>Your grandfather may have taken you camping, but your equipment doesn’t have to look like his. Or function like it!</p>

<p>We’ve combined the latest smart technology and cutting edge design to create a beautiful, rugged, outdoor camping lantern. You can control it from a distance, changing the brightness, choosing the color, or setting it to flash, all with a Bluetooth app on your smartphone. The lanterns also comes with weather sensors which can even alert you to possible changes in weather. It’s light years ahead!</p>
<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1443076071/ioh2ml9csnlistylfoxc.jpg"" src="""" style=""margin-top:10px;margin-bottom:20px;""/>
<h2 style=""color: #D93C00;padding-top:20px;padding-bottom:10px;"">Origins</h2>
<p>A year ago a group of senior managers from the electronics, sourcing and marketing industries, who love the outdoors, got together. They were amazed at the old fashioned look and capabilities of outdoor equipment on the market, so they decided to create their own.</p>
<p>The first products are two new lanterns, the 200 Lumen and the 400 Lumen, that can be controlled by an app on your phone.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1443066671/ul4dnv57xjkklej0mmsk.jpg"" src="""" style=""margin-top:10px;margin-bottom:20px;""/></p>
<h2 style=""color: #D93C00;padding-top:20px;padding-bottom:10px;"">Making Outdoors Easier</h2>
<p>Lost your campsite in the evening light? No problem, pull out your Smartphone and switch your lantern to flash. Tired at the end of the day and don’t want to get out of the tent to turn off the lantern? Easy, just use your phone. Or want to heighten a romantic moment without breaking the spell - with a touch of your finger you can pick one of 16 million colors on your phone!</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1443066549/vu2e1tsjpo9jp4egcpxp.jpg"" src="""" style=""margin-top:10px;margin-bottom:20px;""/></p>
<h2 style=""color: #D93C00;padding-top:20px;padding-bottom:10px;"">Temperature Sensors &amp; Weather</h2>
<p>In addition to adjusting brightness, color and flash, the lantern has sensors to measure temperature, humidity and barometric pressure, again sending signals by Bluetooth straight to your phone app. It will even alert you to possible weather changes. And the lantern comes with a USB port to charge your mobile phone or other devices. The 200 Lumen is 10 inches or 25 cm tall and the 400 Lumen is just under 12 inches or 29 cm, powered by a rechargeable lithium ion power bank or 4 D cells, giving 8 nights at high power and up to 30 at low power. (Batteries sold separately.) The unit is strong but light and with batteries even the larger unit is only just over 3 pounds or 1.6 Kg.</p>

As he explained, “Our aim at o2Tech is to produce a range of outdoor equipment that incorporates the latest IoT technology and also looks great. Beautiful. Connected. Powerful. And Rugged.

You can control it from a distance, changing the brightness, choosing the color, or setting it to flash, all with a Bluetooth app on your smartphone. The lanterns also comes with weather sensors which can even alert you to possible changes in weather. It’s light years ahead!

Origins
A year ago a group of senior managers from the electronics, sourcing and marketing industries, who love the outdoors, got together. They were amazed at the old fashioned look and capabilities of outdoor equipment on the market, so they decided to create their own.
The first products are two new lanterns, the 200 Lumen and the 400 Lumen, that can be controlled by an app on your phone.

Making Outdoors Easier
Lost your campsite in the evening light? No problem, pull out your Smartphone and switch your lantern to flash. Tired at the end of the day and don’t want to get out of the tent to turn off the lantern? Easy, just use your phone. Or want to heighten a romantic moment without breaking the spell - with a touch of your finger you can pick one of 16 million colors on your phone!

Temperature Sensors & Weather
In addition to adjusting brightness, color and flash, the lantern has sensors to measure temperature, humidity and barometric pressure, again sending signals by Bluetooth straight to your phone app. It will even alert you to possible weather changes. And the lantern comes with a USB port to charge your mobile phone or other devices. The 200 Lumen is 10 inches or 25 cm tall and the 400 Lumen is just under 12 inches or 29 cm, powered by a rechargeable lithium ion power bank or 4 D cells, giving 8 nights at high power and up to 30 at low power. (Batteries sold separately.) The unit is strong but light and with batteries even the larger unit is only just over 3 pounds or 1.6 Kg.

Guiding Philosophy
Our Founder, Bernie Auyang,has already built and taken a tech company public on the stock exchange. As he explained, “Our aim at o2Tech is to produce a range of outdoor equipment that incorporates the latest IoT technology and also looks great. Beautiful. Connected. Powerful. And Rugged. That is the mantra for all our products. This is the first example, but there are more in the pipeline.”

Ready to Go
All of the design, engineering and sourcing has been completed. All we need now is the seed money for tooling and initial production. Please help. You will not only be bringing a great product to market,but you will be getting the lanterns at 30 to 50 % off the retail price. Lanterns will be available during Q1 of the new year.
Support Us Now!
Please tell all your friends who love the outdoors too and support us.

The LOOKSTAND is back with a sturdier but slimmer design to satisfy the needs of our backers, and a larger version, the LOOKSTAND MAX, is now available for tablets.     Love About Us   Suggested      The LOOKSTAND 2.0 has been enhanced in the inner design to for better strength and durability for long term usage. We changed the shaft at the base for stronger hold and also added an extra spring for firmer rotation, and fixed the bolts on hinges as well. The new Detach Mount is now slim and easy with only a base mount that the Lookstand can be directly attached/detached from with a simple slide-down functionality.        Our patented stands have a sleek, compact design and can stay attached to the back of the phone/tablet- always ready-to-go. Both stands extend up to a height of a full 7-inches for the perfect, ergonomic viewing angle in both portrait and landscape modes to maximize comfort and productivity. Generic stand vs. LOOKSTAND                      The Detach Mounts are specially designed for our stands to maximize the function of LOOKSTAND by enabling the detachment of the LOOKSTAND from your phone. It allows you to use existing wireless chargers or car chargers/holders. The detailed mechanism within the compact design of the LOOKSTAND holds much functionality. The LOOKSTAND is a multi-functional stand that transforms into a phonestand or tripod for your chosen device.  It can even be used as a selfie-stick!     The LOOKSTAND can be used as a phone grip and can be flipped both horizontally and vertically as a kickstand.    Through a glide out function, the length of the LOOKSTAND may be adjusted to the user's needs from 3.5 inches to 7.1 inches. The LOOKSTAND 2.0 for phone can be used as a holder or selfie-stick in this step.    The LOOKSTAND transforms into a fully adjustable phonestand/tripod for your device.            Recent statistics show the average person spends an average of 4 hours a day on their phones. Fun fact: In an upright position the average human head weighs 12 lbs., but at a 60° angle (the usual angle when looking at your smartphone on your lap or at a desk) that weight increases to 60 lbs. That’s the weight of 4 bowling balls!The LOOKSTAND helps take more than half the pressure off your neck and shoulders for the perfect ergonomic position while using your phone.    DESIGNED TO STAND STRONG. The two foldable legs give stability on any flat surface so your phone/tablet won't topple over or slip.  The LOOKSTAND 2.0 is compatible with all smartphones up to the weight of 9.9 ounces with the exception of folding phones. The LOOKSTAND MAX is compatible with all tablets up to 11 inches, heavier phones, and other devices up to 28 ounces.           WITH PATENTED DESIGN              The Lookstand is not only functional, but also stylish and trendy.

<p>          Entities like Goldman Sachs &amp; Bain Capital (<em>they partner up often</em>) - know, beyond a shadow of any doubt, that they are - Above the Law. As such, like any bank robber with a deck of ""get out of jail free cards"" - they take what they want whenever they can.</p>
<p>          We have been stating, over &amp; over again, that Mitt Romney is lying about when he left Bain Capital. Everyone has now seen the piles of evidence that he did not quit in February 1999. Instead it was August 2001. The case that existed at that time is eToys. It was acquired by Bain Capital &amp; Kay Bee Toys illegally.</p>
<p>          Bain Capital/ Kay Bee had announced it was buying eToys entire estate for $5.4 million (see this WSJ article May 2001 (<a href=""http://online.wsj.com/article/SB990139106774839445.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">here</a>)). Unfortunately for the schemes of Mitt Romney and Bain Capital, yours truly had been hired by the federal estate and approved by the Chief Justice in Delaware to maximize returns at the minimum of expense. When we forced them to pay tens of millions of dollars - they offered me a Bribe to back off and become willfully blind. When I (<em>impolitely</em>) told them no - they set out to squash me.</p>
<p>                                     Well - Now - I get to squash back.</p>

<h3>                     Goldman Sachs &amp; Bain Capital are Above the Law!</h3>
<p>       If it were not for Mitt Romney running for President, they would - (<em>most likely</em>) - still be able to totally get away with it all. Despite the fact that we have public docket record proof of 101 + crimes and 34 acts of Perjury (<em>MNAT &amp; Paul Traub have confessed to the lying under oath 34 times over several years</em>) = we found out that no one wants to punish billion dollar fraudsters. Evidently, when running out the door with all that ill gotten gains - some spills out for the ""watchers"" to gooble up.</p>
<p>         Many a RWNJ state that I got my ass whoop'd and should just lay down and take it. If you think that is true - then this project is not for you.

Now they are doing it flagrantly &amp; blatantly corrupting our federal systems of justice and judges during the era of Clemens, Bonds &amp; Martha - are saying that lying under oath 34 times to a federal court is really not Perjury.</p>

<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>Because they thought they could get away with it all and their Chief Executive Officer could become President (<em>and <strong>pardon</strong> them all</em>), doing the crimes in many states, over many years, with hundreds &amp; hundreds of millions of dollars  and most likely more than $1 Billion; - with the same parties - in multiple courts. This is what is called Racketeering.

<ul>
<li>Bain Capital now has a monopoly over the entire indepdent retail toy industry. They own Toys R Us. Which is in possession of the stolen property of &lt;ay Bee, FAO Schwartz and eToys = all by federal frauds.  </li>
</ul><p>       Another story that main stream media has failed to address is the fact that Kay Bee Toys was under Bain Capital control in bankruptcy multiple times - as was the eToys also. The pattern of business for Bain Capital is to get inside a company as cheap as possible, fleece the monies, file bankruptcy. Rinse &amp; repeat.</p>
<p>        Then, after they suck all the life (and money) out of the entity - that they can.  They also go after the retirement funds of companies and their <strong><em>good</em> </strong>friends policing the bankruptcy court - will let them get away with that too.</p>
<p>        </p>
<p><strong>Mitt Romney owned/ controlled Stage Stores during Bankruptcy in 2000</strong></p>

<p> </p>
<h3>     <strong>Basically Bain Capital sold eToys to Bain Capital for Free!</strong>
</h3>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>         </strong>      As is readily apparent by this diagram/ chart, you can see that Mitt Romney does not have the ability to claim ""6 degrees"" of separation for the cases, issues and on hand criminal cohorts. If you will take notice, Mitt Romney is connected to all those issues that Paul Traub is also connected to.</p>
<p>              Of particular note is the fact that (after he was able to get away with a slap on the wrist in eToys fraud case - due to a very special Mitt Romney/ Bain Capital connection in the United States Attorney's office in Delaware) = Paul Traub also became partners with Ponzi Schemer/ Fraudsters Marc Dreier &amp; Tom Petters.</p>

Bain Capital now has a monopoly over the entire indepdent retail toy industry. They own Toys R Us. Which is in possession of the stolen property of <ay Bee, FAO Schwartz and eToys = all by federal frauds.  
       Another story that main stream media has failed to address is the fact that Kay Bee Toys was under Bain Capital control in bankruptcy multiple times - as was the eToys also. The pattern of business for Bain Capital is to get inside a company as cheap as possible, fleece the monies, file bankruptcy. Rinse & repeat.
        Then, after they suck all the life (and money) out of the entity - that they can.  They also go after the retirement funds of companies and their good friends policing the bankruptcy court - will let them get away with that too.
        
Mitt Romney owned/ controlled Stage Stores during Bankruptcy in 2000

 
     Basically Bain Capital sold eToys to Bain Capital for Free!

 
               As is readily apparent by this diagram/ chart, you can see that Mitt Romney does not have the ability to claim ""6 degrees"" of separation for the cases, issues and on hand criminal cohorts. If you will take notice, Mitt Romney is connected to all those issues that Paul Traub is also connected to.
              Of particular note is the fact that (after he was able to get away with a slap on the wrist in eToys fraud case - due to a very special Mitt Romney/ Bain Capital connection in the United States Attorney's office in Delaware) = Paul Traub also became partners with Ponzi Schemer/ Fraudsters Marc Dreier & Tom Petters.
 
 
    
 
What We Need & What You Get
PERKS

Some of our perks for helping get this story out - is that you will receive honorable mention (unless you wish to remain anonymous) - for assisting. Additionally, we are going to have an insiders weekly update and strategy meetings you can participate upon.
Our goal is to provide a simple, visual reference of the crimes of Bain Capital and help start a federal investigation that Mitt Romney's camp has been able to stymie for over a decade.
For the price of a movie ticket, you can get bragging rights for helping to bring down professional organized criminals and their empire empire; which now seeks to make their founder the President of the United States.
 
Everyone who donates $10 or more, will receive a copy of the DVD.
 
Fight against tyranny,
                       cronyism & corruption 
 
 
 
       Our friend Marge (maggiejean) Foulks took this picture of Mitt Romney at his home in La Jolla. Though you can't get up the hill now - (due to the Secret Service blockade) - we plan to try to film and ask Mitt Romney questions at campaign stops.
 
PLEASE HELP SPREAD THE WORD
              Indiegogo does have social media & other share tools. Please utilize them and help spread the word about this important film. Also inform us - if we are not using them in the best way possible.
       This is a noble battle. We are amoeba's in a civil war against a horde of Goliath's truly ebol. The effort to get this film released may get ugly. Mitt Romney, Bain Capital & Goldman Sachs has all the power, money, along with federal agent corruption and possibly even worse.
                   What we have is the inflexible sword of truth & You!.
 
THANKS
           We thank you for taking the time to consider this project. We know they will reach out to stop this project in any way possible. Therefore, we are going to give those of you who helped make it possible - website & blog updates as we go along.
          They may continue to cover up their crimes, but you will know the truth about it all - as soon as we can possibly get it to you. It is our plan to have the final edit done to release the film by the end of September at the latest.
 
 
     Thanks again - for taking the time to consider this project.
 
 
 

 
  
We leave you with a YouTube video parody of Mitt Romney
  MITT ROMNEY You think you can buy the White House & avoid all your taxes.

<h2><strong>My Story</strong></h2>
<p>Hello!  My name is Al and I'm the creator of Mygazine Daily an application for the ipad that allows you to take your favorite magazines with you - no matter where you are. Mygazine is a leader in changing the way you read news stories, features, and articles by syncing your favorite news sites into one App. </p>
<p>My dream of creating Mygazine Daily arose after travelling a few times in the days when the ipad first came out.  As I sat in the airplane playing mindless games on the ipad, I thought to myself - wouldn’t it be neat if I could have my favorite reading material with me to occupy my time?  I started looking into building an app whereby I could customize all the reading material of my choice in one place. Slowly the idea seemed to keep developing. What if it could arrange my material by categories and arrange it by date...</p>
<p>After two years of labor, I have launched the App very recently and it is getting rave reviews from users.</p>

<h2><strong>How You Can Help</strong></h2>
<p>In order to turn Mygazine Daily into an App store success in the long term, I now need a little support. I need money to continue enhancing the application and to promote it as widely as possible. I am competing in a market where developers of successful apps have millions to spend on marketing but some great apps don’t get a chance because they don’t have the backing of rich executives and millionaires. Unfortunately <strong>I am one of the later</strong>.  So far, I have paid everything out of my own savings. My personal resources are very, very limited, so I have hardly been able to advertise at all. <br/><br/>So I am reaching out to you, for your support.

With InputStick your smartphone can become wireless USB mouse, keyboard, gamepad and so on. This allows apps to: type, move mouse pointer, click, scroll, control multimedia playback and games. Why InputStick?In many situations InputStick gives you many advantages over WiFi/3G/Bluetooth-HID based solutions:1) InputStick is physically plugged into USB port, so it is compatible with ANY USB-enabled hardware:
PCs (Windows, Linux, Mac OS, any other USB-enabled OS).
Embedded systems (Raspberry Pi etc).
Android devices (smartphones, tablets, TV sticks).
Game consoles.
...and more!

2) Almost as easy to use as generic USB mouse or keyboard:
Plug InputStick into USB port.
Run Android application and click ""Connect"".
USB host detects new hardware and if necessary installs generic drivers (if available). No action is required on your part. It usually takes no more than a few seconds.
Ready!
3) Works out of the box:
No need to install server application or configure network.

No need to install custom drivers or modify any OS settings.

Works even if there is no WiFi / 3G network coverage.
No need to root your Android device.
Requirements and limitations:To be able to use InputStick following requirements must be met:
Android 2.3 or later, with Bluetooth radio.
At least one available USB port.
USB host must supply at least 100mW power.
OS must allow to attach new USB devices.
USB host must support given USB class. See examples:

Generic HID keyboard, mouse - supported by most USB hosts.
Generic HID gamepad:

PC (Windows, Linux) - works out of the box.
PC (Mac OS) - requires USB Overdrive software.

Playstation3 - works only with some games.
Xbox360 - not supported at all.
How does it work?InputStick acts as a proxy between your Android device and a USB host: Depending on configuration obtained from Android application, it can present itself as almost any kind of USB device:Since InputStick is physically plugged into USB port, host cannot tell the difference between real USB device (for example: a keyboard) and InputStick.  To use InputStick you will have to install InputStickUtility app on your Android device. It will guide you step-by-step through pairing process, allow to manage all your InputStick devices, upgrade firmware if necessary (via Bluetooth) and provide background service responsible for communication between apps and InputStick. Android applications.Once InputStick is released, following apps will be available (all free and without ads):
Remote Controller: turns your phone into wireless USB keyboard, mouse and multimedia remote.
Password Manager: use InputStick to type URL, user name and password for you! Use long passwords, with special characters, different for each site and don't worry about memorizing them or making typos! 
Gamepad: use your phone as a wireless USB gamepad with 4 axes and 16 buttons. Supports multi-touch and accelerometer.
Presentation remote: turns your phone into wireless USB presentation remote.
Barcode Scanner: turns your smartphone into USB QR/bar-code scanner. 
You can also use InputStick in your own Android application! See ""Developers"" section for more details.Take it anywhere. Use more than one.
InputStick has a size of a USB flash drive, you can easily carry it everywhere you go. Put it in your pocket, attach to a keyring or even keep one it in your wallet.

Applications can easily switch between different InputStick devices.Technical data.Size: 57 x 19 x 9 mm.Weight: 8g.Interface: USB 2.0 (full speed).Wireless connectivity: Bluetooth 2.1.Range: up to 10m.Developers.InputStick Android API will allow you to easily use InputStick in your own Android applications. Using standard USB devices is very easy and requires almost no USB related knowledge. Currently available USB device classes are:
USB Keyboard,
USB Mouse,
USB Gamepad,
USB Keyboard & Mouse & Consumer Control (volume control, media playback).
You can also implement other USB devices, however that requires some experience with USB development. But don't worry, there will be tutorials and step by step guides available. Keep in mind that because of using Bluetooth to communicate with Android device, there are latency and data throughput limitations. It is not recommended to use InputStick as USB devices that require high data transfer rate (mass storage, audio, imaging etc.).Current state of the project.InputStick has been under development for almost a year now. What you can see on the video and pictures is 100% working prototype, which is almost ready to go into production any day now. Because of that, this is a flexible funding campaign, so even in case when funding goal won't be reached, you'll get your InputStick device. Please keep in mind that there is always a small possibility of project being slightly delayed, because of certification or production issues.Perks and shipment.InputStick will be available in black and white enclosures. Devices will be shipped in March 2014, via registered priority 
air-mail. International shipment and taxes (for EU customers) are 
already included in the price of each perk. You are responsible for 
any import fees which might apply according to local law.Want to know more?Visit inputstick.com for more details.All trademarks, product names and logos are the property of their respective owners.",7.0,0,"2 Campaigns

</div></div>","Short Summary My name is Fausto Heikkinen. I have been researching for a battery that does not die. Yes, does not die. It is not galvanic neither REDOX chemical reactions.
I have invested a substantial fund of mine into this but now it is time for the real research start with real means.
This research has demonstrated already via my YouTube videos (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_hGvb-8ud8)   where I am.   What We Need & What You Get I need equipment and materials very simple. Equipment for testing and extensively testing. Materials for constructing the batteries
To those that will help I will send one of my cells running and showing the progress of my work.
I have one cell that is a total success but creating more is only possible with resources.
The Impact
 Can you imagine flash lights that never dies? Home items that does not need to replace batteries?  If the research is really advanced and successful, can you image a phone that does not need to be recharged or change batteries?
Yes this is all possible.
Risks & Challenges
 All my work is exposed via Youtube videos and forums where I am open for discussions and even participate on creating your own battery cell.
This has been a 5 years research so the risk is time..
  Other Ways You Can Help If you are not interested in helping me with funds, would you be willing to buy the materials or equipment that I need?",0.0,0,"3 Campaigns

<h3>Restore Digital Privacy</h3>
<p>We built the Internet to be a space for freedom and opportunity. Instead it has become the greatest surveillance system ever. My name is Pieter Hintjens, CEO of iMatix, and I want you to help me fix that.</p>
<p>Without privacy and anonymity, we lose our freedom of speech. And without that, we become slaves to a narrative where the powerful run amok, without oversight or regulation. I truly believe we're facing the extinction of our digital freedoms, and then our real world freedoms.</p>

<p>The Internet is the problem. Central web services are too easy to tap. To demand data from. To seize and shutdown, even. And broadband internet connections are trivial to spy on. We can't trust any large firm to keep our secrets safe. Legally, they can't, if they get a National Security Letter from the NSA.</p>
<p>So the idea is to make it really expensive to spy on us. Instead of using thin clients talking over broadband to web services, I want to build mesh networks out of our smartphones and laptops.</p>
<p>People have tried mesh networks many times, so what's different now? The answer is we've got much better software, stuff like ZeroMQ and Zyre, two of the free software projects I've spent years on. Zyre makes it simple to get phones talking to each other in cells. A cell covers a small local area. Cells talk to cells, covering wider and wider areas, whole cities.</p>
<p>I call this ""edgenet"".</p>
<p></p>
<h3>What We Need from You</h3>
<p>Making new software is just expensive, and without funding, Edge Net might still happen, or it might not. So we need your financial support. We set our funding goal at $1,000. Realistically we need a hundred times that to build final products ordinary people can download and run on their smartphones.</p>
<p>The budgets -- however much we raise -- will be handled by my company, iMatix, which has a long track record of making free software. We built ZeroMQ, CZMQ, Zyre, FileMQ, and many other free software projects. It'll let us switch from other projects to work only on edgenet. It'll let us hire designers, security specialists, and other people who can help make this happen.</p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.45em;"">Everything we build will be (as it already is) free software based on open protocols. </span><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.45em;"">We don't want to make edgenet for ourselves, but for the whole world.

We believe students are going through a lot of transitions; finding new friends, new clubs, and communities, etc. can be difficult in an unfamiliar environment.  Hayle would be the ideal app to make this process a more comfortable and enjoyable experience. Tourists would also benefit from Hayle when traveling to another city. They would be able to find events, explore the new environment, and meet nearby individuals. Since the Newsfeed is customized for each user based on their interests, users can quickly find events directed towards them. This can help tourists and backpackers manage their time more efficiently. Hayle is a mobile social-networking app that matches local users based on their mutual interests and hobbies.However, unlike other mainstream apps, Hayle provides many features and tools that help build and develop these connections.Hayle also provides the ability to discover new communities, opportunities, and events based on personal interests, passions and hobbies.Hayle is a great app for users to quickly become more comfortable in a new environment and shows them new ways to explore the world.Our open-beta will be released by mid-April to conduct social experiments. We will be focusing our efforts on growing the user-base in Ottawa. We hope to officially launch in August 2018, right before school starts and before summer ends.We need $9,300 by March 16, 2018, to pay off our full-stack programmer. Without it, we won’t be able to conduct our social experiments. Starting off, we will be launching across Toronto, Ottawa, and Montreal.  Due to our targetted audience, we will be focusing on post-secondary institutions. If the user-base is large enough, we’d like to expand across every major city in Canada and USA. Our end goal would be to release our app worldwide. As a society, we’ve become increasingly reliant on our smartphones and often lack real-life interactions. This has led to our current culture of isolation. Nowadays, it’s difficult to find local individuals who really want to connect over mutual passions and hobbies. Have you ever wanted to go to a niche event with friends, and then ended up realizing that no one else in your circle was interested? We created Hayle to resolve these issues. Our proposed solution aims to differentiate itself from the competition by providing a platform uniquely focused on the user's interests and environment.Hayle finds individuals beyond age and gender; it’s all about the mutual interest(s).The matches you make on Hayle will always be with people that share a common ground, which should lead to stronger friendships and healthier relationships.Though connecting with new individuals may not be for everyone. Hayle also offers a Newsfeed to help you find discussions, opportunities, and events that match your interests and hobbies.We believe that bringing back human interaction and getting people involved in their own city will fill the void that social media creates. How is Hayle different?Here’s a list of our competitors:1. Facebook
Minimal options to make new friends
Utilized to record friends you made in the past
Newsfeed is cluttered and not directed towards the user
Low focus on the local community
2. Match Group, inc (Tinder)
Dating app
Matches are made by age, gender, and distance
Short-lived relationships
No way to develop those relationships
3. Meet Up
Heavily focused on events - Social Gatherings
Doesn’t offer a way to make one on one connections
Events are large and broad
No guarantee of making connections in these events.
4. Shapr
Connected with LinkedIn; matches users by business interests.
Focused heavily on business connections.
5. NextdoorA private social network, connecting with people in your area. This is targeted for users who want to know their neighbors. If you would like more info on other competitors, feel free to contact us. 
The “Connect” is a feature allows you to discover people nearby that share your interests.
You can chat and meet with other users that you find on Connect.
Connect offers a scroll and swipe mode to allow for more options and flexibility.

Scroll (Left phone): Displays nearby users as a list.
Swipe (Right phone): Displays nearby users one by one, by specific interest.

The main purpose is to develop and maintain the relationships you make on “Connect”.
Make your own private or public communities with your new friends.
Find others nearby that also have the same interest or hobby.

</ul><h2>About this project</h2>
<p><strong>HOW IT BEGAN. </strong>Inspiration for my project came when I first acquired my first smartphone, the iPhone 4, back in June 2010. I had been working out at the gym several times a week and had been doing so for years. Given the numerous visits to the gym and the long duration of my workouts, especially on the cardio exercise machines, having my smartphone with me at all times was a necessity. Being able to to listen to music, surf the web, email, text message and watch streaming videos provided a modicum of sanity by helping to make those long, boring workouts productive, entertaining and easier to bear.</p>
<p><strong>THE PROBLEM.</strong> The major challenge was finding a safe and convenient location to set my smartphone down. At first I would just hold the phone in my hands. However, this became quite unwieldy and eventually fatigue would set in and then it became outright unpleasant. I thought that if there were only a way to securely attach the phone in a landscape position to the control panel or some other stationary part of the gym or exercise equipment, it could be situated up and out of the way, with the display directly facing me. In this way, the phone would be firmly attached with the screen positioned at an optimum viewing or working angle—an essential position to be able to type, surf the web, text, email or watch movies, and without having to hold up or balance the phone in hand during exercise or other activity. I needed something that would allow me to do all of this virtually ""hands free"".</p>
<p><strong>THE ANSWER.</strong> Desperate to find a solution, I searched high and low for a product that could solve my dilemma but found none. Given the lack of a solution, I was driven to find one on my own. Now, after many months and endless cycles of improving the design, revisions, refinements and adding additional features, I now have a solution in the iDock Versatile Base.</p>
<p><strong>WHAT IS IT?</strong> Quite simply, the iDock is a multipurpose holder for smartphones. However, it is more than just a mount because it is so much more versatile. In fact, there really is nothing like it. It is a useful accessory to have on hand at all times and provides a practical solution to problems or needs that many smartphone owners currently face—all of this bundled up into one compact, portable and unique design. Finally, smartphone owners will be able to take full advantage of the capabilities of their devices, even while on-the-go, making owning a smartphone ever more worthwhile.</p>
<p><strong>WHO WILL WANT IT?</strong> Possibly most every smartphone user out there—though some may not even know it yet. After all, there isn't quite anything like the iDock. Despite ever increasing features, more demanding applications and uses for smartphones, the current crop of accessories and solutions have not adequately addressed the needs, much less the desires of most users. It's as if the market hasn't come to the realization that smartphones are not just phones anymore, but full-fledged computers and media devices.

About this project
HOW IT BEGAN. Inspiration for my project came when I first acquired my first smartphone, the iPhone 4, back in June 2010. I had been working out at the gym several times a week and had been doing so for years. Given the numerous visits to the gym and the long duration of my workouts, especially on the cardio exercise machines, having my smartphone with me at all times was a necessity. Being able to to listen to music, surf the web, email, text message and watch streaming videos provided a modicum of sanity by helping to make those long, boring workouts productive, entertaining and easier to bear.
THE PROBLEM. The major challenge was finding a safe and convenient location to set my smartphone down. At first I would just hold the phone in my hands. However, this became quite unwieldy and eventually fatigue would set in and then it became outright unpleasant. I thought that if there were only a way to securely attach the phone in a landscape position to the control panel or some other stationary part of the gym or exercise equipment, it could be situated up and out of the way, with the display directly facing me. In this way, the phone would be firmly attached with the screen positioned at an optimum viewing or working angle—an essential position to be able to type, surf the web, text, email or watch movies, and without having to hold up or balance the phone in hand during exercise or other activity. I needed something that would allow me to do all of this virtually ""hands free"".
THE ANSWER. Desperate to find a solution, I searched high and low for a product that could solve my dilemma but found none. Given the lack of a solution, I was driven to find one on my own. Now, after many months and endless cycles of improving the design, revisions, refinements and adding additional features, I now have a solution in the iDock Versatile Base.
WHAT IS IT? Quite simply, the iDock is a multipurpose holder for smartphones. However, it is more than just a mount because it is so much more versatile. In fact, there really is nothing like it. It is a useful accessory to have on hand at all times and provides a practical solution to problems or needs that many smartphone owners currently face—all of this bundled up into one compact, portable and unique design. Finally, smartphone owners will be able to take full advantage of the capabilities of their devices, even while on-the-go, making owning a smartphone ever more worthwhile.
WHO WILL WANT IT? Possibly most every smartphone user out there—though some may not even know it yet. After all, there isn't quite anything like the iDock. Despite ever increasing features, more demanding applications and uses for smartphones, the current crop of accessories and solutions have not adequately addressed the needs, much less the desires of most users. It's as if the market hasn't come to the realization that smartphones are not just phones anymore, but full-fledged computers and media devices. Users need to be able to use them as such at all times, wherever they may be, during most any type of activity. Smartphone videographers will marvel at their ability to shoot stable video for extended periods of time without strain.The bottom line is that iDock is an accessory that is sorely needed and it has been for quite some time.
TAKING IT TO THE NEXT LEVEL. Having built a fully functional model, I've tested and put it through real-world applications and it has performed admirably. Those who have seen it in action have been thoroughly impressed by its unique features and functionality and cannot wait to have one of their own. It certainly has tremendous potential. Eventually, the same concept can be used to develop a base to accommodate larger tablets. For now though my focus is on the iDock for smartphones and your help brings me that much closer to making it a reality. Your support will fund product development to get it to market. My initial goal is to patent and and then hire a product design/consulting firm to design and build a prototype. Remainder of  funding will go toward manufacturing and marketing.
Thank you in advance for your generous support. I appreciate your interest in my project and hope that together, we can bring this revolutionary product to the world.

<p> </p></figure></div></div>","This is a charge-and-sync cable that is hidden within a braided leather bracelet.NILS is designed with a purpose to set your hands free from carrying any excess cords, which function as a charge-and-sync wearable cable. Nobody would notice what it really is, it can be your bracelet daily.We believe that the humble yet smart design by showcasing practical and sophisticated combination to the market would be a new trend.
  
First of all, the traditional charging cables are not wearable. You store them either in your bags or pockets, the least you want is when your device flags in low battery, yet you couldn’t sort out your tangled cables. By the time you did, your phone is power off.It is a bit annoying, isn’t it?Let alone, traditional cables are less appealing, you can lose them by being picked up by someone else as they all look similar.
To share your pain, we are proud to present NILS to you. NILS is the first ever charging cable bracelet in the world that does not sacrifice the aesthetic for its functionality.

A great product is all about attitude and being relevant. Our innovation process not only included creativity, but also usability, accessibility, and functionality. A perfect balance between classy and quality, the matte finish on the metal case elevates the sleek look and retain a touch of design details.

NILS, a chic accessory-like charging cable can perfectly integrate into your lifestyle.

<p><strong>THE BIG, EXCITING PICTURE - A FREE, GLOBAL LIBRARY OF WEBSITES: The Library of Congress meets Pinterest!</strong></p>
<p><br/>What would you get if you merged the Library of Congress and Pinterest?  That's what this campaign is about!</p>
<p>WebHub.mobi is a new social network of libraries of websites, offering public and private libraries of websites for free to anyone with a browser. </p>
<p>This campaign is to build features into the library that allow private users globally to share their own groups of favorite sites on any subject as part of the library for the benefit of everyone. This means that WebHub helps you find the best groupings of websites for what you want, based on what other people with similar interests have added to the library.  And, you and your network will also be able to share groups of websites privately, giving you another channel for finding the best sites for what you are interested in.</p>
<p>WebHub works a little like Pinterest. In Pinterest, people pin images of things on the Web that they like into groups they create called ""boards.'  In WebHub, people gather websites into groups they like in their own private libraries.  WebHub also has a public library of websites that immediately available to everyone.</p>
<p>For books, public libraries are one of humanity's greatest achievements, such as, the ancient Library of Alexandria (now re-constructed), the Library of Congress, the New York Public Library and all the local public libraries in cities and towns around the world. </p>
<p>Websites are a version of books.  Just like books, websites cover a vast range of subject matter, providing users with expanded knowledge, information and entertainment on almost every imaginable subject from almost everywhere in the world. </p>
<p>Just like books, websites deserve a library, where they can be collected, indexed, annotated, searched and shared, just like a library of books.  However, there is no simple system for cataloging and organizing websites by groups so that they are easy to find and use from any device, especially mobile.  Search engines offer individual people one-off searches, and bookmarking and favorites work up to a point for some individuals.</p>
<p>That is what is so exciting about this campaign: help build this global library of websites from where it is now into a social network that lets anyone, anywhere in the world add to the library for everyone's benefit. </p>
<p><strong>THE WEBHUB <em>PUBLIC</em> LIBRARY: <a href=""WWW.WEBHUB.MOBI"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">WWW.WEBHUB.MOBI</a> </strong></p>
<p>What if there was a core, free public library with a very simple indexing system that was designed from the start to make mobile browsing easy across a huge range of websites and across all types of devices that people now use to surf the Web, and to expand all of our Web horizons? That's what we've started at <a href=""http://www.webhub.mobi."" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.webhub.mobi.</a> </p>
<p>The user interface system is designed to work as easily (and identically) on small touchscreens on smartphones as on the larger screens of ereaders, tablets, laptops and pcs.</p>
<p>Using a simple system of Hubs, Categories and Links, our library system can catalog and index the whole Web, and give people a fast, easy access to a huge range of websites.  ""Hubs"" are at the highest level of organization.  Each ""Hub"" has a set of ""Categories"".  Each combination of Hub and Category, has a set of associated websites in what we call ""Link"" keys. </p>
<p>For instance, in WebHub's public library now, there are ""Hubs"" for Art, Education, News, Travel, Philanthropy, Humor, Literature and many more.  In, Travel Hub, there are ""Categories"" for Airlines, Hotels, Cars, Travel Portals, etc.  In Art Hub, there are ""Categories"" for Art Events, Art News, Museums by city around the world, etc.  In Music Hub, there are multiple categories, and the websites in the categories include major streaming sits such as Rhapsody, Lastfm, Spotify, 8tracks, etc as well as Music Blogs and more, each with a quick description.</p>
<p>For each website in the WebHub library, there is a common name, a URL, a set of tags and a short text description. </p>
<p>This means that just by choosing a Hub in a general area of interest, the user can access groups of websites organized by Category, and each website is carefully annotated so the user knows what it is about before the user clicks through to the site.</p>
<p><strong>THE WEBHUB <em>PRIVATE</em> LIBRARIES</strong></p>
<p>In addition to the WebHub public library, WebHub lets users create their own private libraries where users can build their own, private groups of indexed and organized websites.  The private libraries have many features.  For example: (1) users can create guest password which let other people visit (but not edit) that user's private library; (2) users can store their usernames and passwords for each site in their private library; and (3) users can keep notes specific to each site in their library and notes that apply across all their private library. </p>
<p>The guest feature in private libraries is the beginnings of the WebHub social network of libraries of websites that this campaign will take to the next level.</p>
<p><strong>WATCH VIDEOS ABOUT THE LIBRARY'S CURRENT FEATURES</strong></p>
<p>You can learn more about the currently released features of WebHub by visiting the website, and by going to the WebHub youtube channel which has a series of quick tutorial and informational videos at <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/user/webhubdotmobi"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.youtube.com/user/webhubdotmobi</a>.</p>
<p><strong>THE CAMPAIGN - THE FEATURES YOU CAN HELP US BUILD<br/></strong></p>
<p>This campaign is to extend the feature set of WebHub's public and private libraries in a very powerful and exciting way.  Here's the big picture idea: what if any individual anywhere in the world can help grow the scope of the library by contributing some or all of his/her private library to the public, shared library? </p>
<p>Think of it!  People everywhere have specific areas of interest and expertise where they know the top websites that appy to those areas.  They have done the hard work of finding and selecting the best websites in their areas of interest.  With the feature set funded by this campaign, users can, if they want, share some or all of this collection of websites with the rest of us, enriching everybody.</p>
<p>For instance, a person in Europe may have a collection of the leading, local independent newspaper websites in cities across Europe.  A person in India may know the best set of Indian cultural websites.  A person in Brazil may know the leading soccer websites in Brazil.  A person in the US may know the leading country music websites.  A person in Indonesia may know the key local sites covering education in Indonesia. </p>
<p>Right now, all of us separately have to expend a significant amount of time and energy searching and culling through the Web to find and compile the best group of sites on any subject.  We want to extend WebHub, with your help, into a social network that allows each of us to add to the public library with our own knowledge of the best grouping of websites, and that allows each of us to benefit from the knowledge and work of others who choose to add to the library.  In this way, vast new areas of the Web will become instantly available to everyone, rather than just the few websites we tend to visit regularly and those that we each individually go through all the effort of searching for each time we think of something we might want or need on the web. </p>
<p>This is especially relevant and timely as (1) more and more people around the world add content to the web, and (2) search engines become more and more focused on delivering results based on personal profiles and the location the user is searching from.</p>
<p><strong>WHAT YOUR HELP WILL ENABLE US TO DO</strong></p>
<p>We need funding to develop and release the features that allow us to build social sharing features into WebHub making it a true, global community effort and value.</p>
<p>That's the purpose and excitement of this campaign:  create a truly global library system that leverages the knowledge and private expertise of people around the world of the Web to expand all of our web experiences easily to every corner of the Web from any of our devices.</p>
<p>The specific set of features this campaign will fund are:</p>
<p>1.  The ability for users who have created private libraries to identify some or all of their private library to contribute to the public, shared library for others to access, and as part of that identification process, to add a text description of the group of sites the user is sharing, as well as tags.</p>
<p>2.  The ability for users of the public and private libraries to search the public, shared library of websites, including the groupings added by other users.  The search will include various filters, such as a filter for highly rated private user additions, and a filter for search for exact text matches of just URLs.</p>
<p>3.  The ability of private users to import into their private library groupings that they find and like. </p>
<p>3.  The ability for users to rate the groupings shared by other private users.</p>
<p>4.  The ability for users to make some or all of their private library shareable within only a select group of other private users.</p>
<p><strong>WHEN WILL THESE NEW FEATURES BE READY FOR EVERYONE TO USE?</strong></p>
<p>Based on our experience developing WebHub to date and our assessment of the development time for these features, we are targeting that these features will be ready about three-to-four months after we receive the funding we need from this campaign.  This gives us time to do careful development and careful testing so that all these new features work properly when we release them publicly. </p>
<p>We would be happy to hear from any of you who would like to participate as responsible beta testers at the appropriate time in the development cycle, who we can give early access to features for purposes of kicking the tires in all the different contexts in which the libraries need to work (smartphones, touchscreens, tablets, various operating systems, various browsers, etc).</p>
<p><strong>WHO WE ARE</strong></p>
<p>We are a dynamic, small team of people who have been working together to build WebHub.  The inventor, designer and team leader is Tim Higginson who is based near Chicago.  He has a background in technology innovation, software development and project management.  One of Tim's grandfathers (Dr. Andrew D. Osborn) was a professional librarian who worked at leading libraries (including the library system of the University of Sydney, Australia; the New York Public Library and Harvard University's libraries), and who was instrumental in the design of modern public and university library systems.  Tim's LinkedIn page is provided as a link as part of the campaign information. Other members of the team include superb software and relational database experts based near San Francisco and Chicago, including:  Eric Glover in Chicago and Heath Carlisle of Brown Barn Studios near San Francisco.</p>
<p>This team has successfully built WebHub's free public and private libaries of websites, including all their current features, that you can use now at <a href=""http://www.webhub.mobi"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.webhub.mobi</a>.  We have the track record to achieve the goals of this campaign.  We believe the major technical challenges we face will be in the areas of pushing the envelope in terms of what we are doing with relational databases that underpin the library system, and in terms of the user interface that presents the library content to users in a simple, uniform way that is easy to use across devices and browsers, and whether from a touchscreen or a device with a keyboard and mouse or touchpad.  We have analyzed these challenges, and are ready to start developing these features in a careful and robust process when we start receiving funding through this campaign.</p>
</div>
<div><strong>THE UNIQUE PERKS</strong></div>
<div> </div>
<div>We are offering exciting perks.  The perks all relate in various ways to the WebHub ""Library of Websites"". </div>
<div> </div>
<div>We will make supporters ""patrons"" of the library, and place a graphical ""patron medallion"" that will appear next to the WebHub logo every time that supporer logs into their own private WebHub.  In that way, our supporters will know by the medallion that they have been a founding patron of the first global library of websites.  We will also create a ""patron wall"" page on the WebHub website, and include names of patrons (or ""anonymous"" if a patron prefers that).  These are to thank our supporters and recognize them privately and publicly for being a patron of the arts and libraries.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>At each contribution level, we have a physical item that we can mail to supporters if a supporter wants something physical and in addition to the medallions and patron wall recognition.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>For our highest level supporters, we will create positions on a ""library advisory board"" along with our senior team.  We will keep the library advisory board up-to-date on planning, and we will seek advice and recommendations from the board regarding WebHub on an on-going basis.  We are limiting this support level to 4 positions, so this is perfect for instance for four friends who want to participate together on this WebHub ""library advisory board.""</div>
<div> </div>
<div><strong>WHAT WE WILL DO IF WE GET LESS THAN THE WHOLE GOAL</strong></div>
<div> </div>
<div>We have built WebHub on a rolling basis.  Our roadmap for WebHub is divided into ""priority groups.""  With funds that are less than the whole goal of this campaign, we will execute on as many individual priority groups as the funding permits.  We are great at achieving a lot on a little.</div>
<div> </div>
<div><strong>THE IMPACT</strong></div>
<div> </div>
<div>The impact of a global library of websites with the critical search and social sharing features that are the focus of this campaign is extraordinary.  The goal is to provide people worldwide with the ability to share, find and import groups of websites on virtually any topic from anywhere in the world.  This can revolutionize the scope, speed and ease of everyone's access to the most interesting websites from around the world, expanding all of our Web horizons.</div>
<div>

</div></div>","THE BIG, EXCITING PICTURE - A FREE, GLOBAL LIBRARY OF WEBSITES: The Library of Congress meets Pinterest!
What would you get if you merged the Library of Congress and Pinterest?  That's what this campaign is about!
WebHub.mobi is a new social network of libraries of websites, offering public and private libraries of websites for free to anyone with a browser. 
This campaign is to build features into the library that allow private users globally to share their own groups of favorite sites on any subject as part of the library for the benefit of everyone. This means that WebHub helps you find the best groupings of websites for what you want, based on what other people with similar interests have added to the library.  And, you and your network will also be able to share groups of websites privately, giving you another channel for finding the best sites for what you are interested in.
WebHub works a little like Pinterest. In Pinterest, people pin images of things on the Web that they like into groups they create called ""boards.'  In WebHub, people gather websites into groups they like in their own private libraries.  WebHub also has a public library of websites that immediately available to everyone.
For books, public libraries are one of humanity's greatest achievements, such as, the ancient Library of Alexandria (now re-constructed), the Library of Congress, the New York Public Library and all the local public libraries in cities and towns around the world.

<p>Isowalk is the world's first intelligent walking assistant. It replaces primitive canes with modern technology that's been designed from the ground up to adapt itself to each individual user and <strong>actively help them walk.</strong></p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/867689/pictures/full/20130612192559-headershot.jpg?1371090362"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>A breakthrough in personal mobility, Isowalk combines the best of modern ergonomics, orthopedics, biomechanics, aerospace engineering and aesthetic design. Isowalk's innovations have already been awarded<strong> two U.S. patents.</strong></p>
<h2>Our goal: Help millions of people walk.</h2>
<p>We believe Isowalk is already the world's best walking assistant, even while it's still in beta.</p>
<p>With your help, we will tool and manufacture the first Isowalks in volume and make this revolutionary mobility aid available to the world. <strong>Contributors will be first to get one,</strong> of course -- for themselves or a loved one.<br/><br/></p>

<p>With a successful campaign, we will also deploy the <strong>digital intelligence</strong> (see below) that will make Isowalk a wireless 'smart object' for digital health and security applications.</p>
<p><strong>Should we be lucky enough</strong> to exceed our goal, we'd use your generous support to make more Isowalks, of course.  But you'll also be helping accelerate our plans for specialized models for every kind of user, application and budget, including <strong>seniors, athletics, recovery, obesity and pediatrics.</strong></p>
<p> We believe that everyone who needs or wants this technology should have it. </p>
<h2><strong>Real<em> </em>walking assistance. It's about time!</strong></h2>
<p>The most common walking aid is the cane, which is very likely <strong>the world's oldest technology.</strong> It actually shows up in Egyptian hieroglyphics and has barely changed for thousands of years.</p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/867438/pictures/full/20130612172638-primitive.jpg?1371083205"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>In terms of ergonomics and usability (not to mention looks!), canes are an <strong>epic fail,</strong> which is why virtually everyone hates to use one. They're <strong>uncomfortable, painful, awkward</strong> -- the ultimate 'dumb' device. <strong>A cane doesn't help you walk.</strong> Its real purpose is to keep you from falling.</p>
<p><span>Isowalk (finally) applies <strong>modern principles and technologies</strong> to walking assistance.  Here's how this revolutionary device takes us beyond today's crude canes and sticks:</span></p>

<h3 class=""p1"">What makes Isowalk so different than a cane?<span class=""s1""><strong><br/></strong></span>
</h3>
<p class=""p1"">Isowalk adapts to the user, instead of the user adapting to the cane. A cane keeps you from falling, while Isowalk helps you walk.</p>
<h3 class=""p1"">What's wrong with canes anyway?</h3>
<p class=""p1"">If you've ever used one, you probably wouldn't ask. Simply put, they hurt. They focus the user's weight on some of the most fragile parts of the body. They force the hand, wrist and arm into weak, unnatural positions with poor leverage. The shoulder, back and neck try to compensate, causing associated strains.</p>
<h3 class=""p1"">Is Isowalk safer than a cane?</h3>
<p class=""p1"">Canes are frequently quite dangerous, mostly because of unpredictable ground contact. About <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/30/health/30fall.html?_r=0"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span class=""s2"">47k Americans are treated in emergency rooms</span></a> each year after falling from their walker or cane.

<p class=""p1"">No. The FDA classifies this as a ""Class I"" (general controls) device that does not require any special pre-market approvals or regulation.</p>
<h3 class=""p1"">Who is Isowalk's team?</h3>
<p class=""p1"">Isowalk's brain trust is made up of veterans representing numerous avenues of the technology world. Sensitivities with their day gigs prevent any direct shout outs here, but to brag a little, Isowalk's manufacturing guru has brought literally millions of home and personal tech products to market, including numerous best-sellers. Our wireless guru is one of the most eminent figures in the US smart home market. Our visual ID guru's work has won over 250 awards. Our acting CFO has 25 years of experience, etc. We are a startup with tons of experience and long success records.</p>
<h3 class=""p1"">What about all these smart apps?</h3>
<p class=""p1"">We see Isowalk as 'wearable technology' that the user doesn't have to wear. A smart Isowalk can monitor biometric data such as cardiovascular levels; progressive data like distance and recovery; location data (did Grandpa wander off?) and more.

<p> </p></div>","Meet Isowalk.
Isowalk is the world's first intelligent walking assistant. It replaces primitive canes with modern technology that's been designed from the ground up to adapt itself to each individual user and actively help them walk.

A breakthrough in personal mobility, Isowalk combines the best of modern ergonomics, orthopedics, biomechanics, aerospace engineering and aesthetic design. Isowalk's innovations have already been awarded two U.S. patents.
Our goal: Help millions of people walk.
We believe Isowalk is already the world's best walking assistant, even while it's still in beta.
With your help, we will tool and manufacture the first Isowalks in volume and make this revolutionary mobility aid available to the world. Contributors will be first to get one, of course -- for themselves or a loved one.

With a successful campaign, we will also deploy the digital intelligence (see below) that will make Isowalk a wireless 'smart object' for digital health and security applications.
Should we be lucky enough to exceed our goal, we'd use your generous support to make more Isowalks, of course.  But you'll also be helping accelerate our plans for specialized models for every kind of user, application and budget, including seniors, athletics, recovery, obesity and pediatrics.
 We believe that everyone who needs or wants this technology should have it. 
Real walking assistance. It's about time!
The most common walking aid is the cane, which is very likely the world's oldest technology. It actually shows up in Egyptian hieroglyphics and has barely changed for thousands of years.

In terms of ergonomics and usability (not to mention looks!), canes are an epic fail, which is why virtually everyone hates to use one. They're uncomfortable, painful, awkward -- the ultimate 'dumb' device. A cane doesn't help you walk. Its real purpose is to keep you from falling.
Isowalk (finally) applies modern principles and technologies to walking assistance.  Here's how this revolutionary device takes us beyond today's crude canes and sticks:




 


Isowalk and the Internet of Things
Isowalk already has native biomechanical intelligence that will be built into every model.  But the fun really starts as we begin to add digital intelligence for Isowalk Connected.
Advances in low-power wireless technologies (Bluetooth, ANT+, Z-Wave, etc.) and similar advances in touch and pressure sensitive materials open a tremendous range of smart applications for Isowalk in the Internet of Things. Possibilities include real-time and archived progress feedback, location detection, and interaction with motion sensors at home or away.

We've already identified several of the most appropriate wireless solutions that are practical for these kinds of applications.  Our team is connected to extensive leading-edge expertise in wireless technologies, as well as a world-class testing facility.
With a successful campaign, we will not only launch the first Isowalks to the market, we'll also select the winning digital platform(s) and build the initial edition of the first Isowalk Connected models. 
Who is Isowalk?
Isowalk is a bootstrapped startup, seeded by a core group of friends and family and spearheaded by me - Ron Goldberg.  I'm a 25-year consumer technologies veteran and ninja innovator and have a long history of helping to launch new technologies into the world. 
If you know me (hi!), you already know the kinds of people and organizations that I work with.  If you don't know me, a look at my LinkedIn or Facebook page gives you some background. With a bit of trawling, you can also see my profile at the Innovation Movement.

<p>Some are very heavily distorted, like the one below.  The reason for this is because most cameras are fixed and don't pan.  So in order to maximize the viewing area with a ""fish-eye"" lens, image quality must be sacraficed.</p>

<p>1. The frames per second is at 3! This means the stream will be extremely choppy, and the lag time will be unbearable.</p>
<p>2. The contrast is all wrong.  It looks black and white even in a completely lit environment.</p>
<p>3. The lens angle is very narrow.</p>

It is an exclusive Indiegogo sales event offered only on select sites.
DUE TO RECENT DEMAND FOR AN AFFORDABLE OUTDOOR SECURITY CAMERA













This is the very first weather-resistant remotely controlled outdoor camera that lets you monitor the outside of your home from anywhere in the world.   
  
The iSensor HD Patio Edition gives you the ability to monitor your home’s surroundings from anywhere in the world at any time.  If suspicious activity were to take place, it will inform you instantly with notifications, snapshots, and HD quality videos which are automatically uploaded to your Google Drive for FREE! Set it up in under 1-minute and let the iSensor HD Patio Edition scare off intruders before they even think about entering your home. Previous Comments:






























At Amaryllo, we design, test, and assemble all our products and accessories.  Over the past few months, we've been trying to improve the robustness of the casing for the iSensor HD.  
All Patio editions will be pre-sealed at our facilities before shipment.  
*Although possible, we urge you not to open the casing as it may compromise the gaskets and rubber seals resulting in leakage.





In the video below, you can see a couple of tests we conducted on the water resistant capabilities of the iSensor HD.  We had no leakage at all on our final tests and feel very comfortable with going into production very soon.




In the video below, we test the functionality of the iSensor HD in extreme cold.  We concluded that the cold has little to no effect on the ability to pan nor does it affect the video quality.









The iSensor HD is the world's smallest remote control home security camera!












The iSensor HD Patio updates you with what's happening on the outside of your home.  Keeping an eye on your front door, pool, garden, or even watching over your pets has never been easier! 
Warnings Lights, Alarms, HD Video, Free Cloud Storage, 240° Viewing, and a Weather-Resistant Exterior, 
The iSensor HD Patio is just what you're looking for!








The iSensor HD can be remotely panned 170° via your mobile device, and together with a 70° lens, it has a 240° range of view with no distortion.




 iSensor HD Patio has built-in motion and audio sensors. Once triggered, it will automatically send you a push text and/or push picture alert. 
The push messages include a time stamp, so you know exactly when the alert was triggered.
This service is completely FREE!


 
After selecting one of the push notifications on the phone as shown above, you will be redirected to our application where you will see the chosen snapshot, as shown below.





After exiting out of the snapshot, you will see a chronological history of all your snapshot alerts, as shown below.














Here's a still image of another iSensor HD placed inside a restaurant.  As you can see, the image keeps its integrity without visual distortion.
You can view this camera at www.live.amaryllo.eu


 Below are screeshots of our competitor's HD cameras.
Some are very heavily distorted, like the one below.  The reason for this is because most cameras are fixed and don't pan.  So in order to maximize the viewing area with a ""fish-eye"" lens, image quality must be sacraficed.
This one is better than the last, however you can still see lines that are distorted when they should be straight.  The contrast is also not right.


The screenshot below, also has heavy distortion and color issues.  


Finally, below there are quite a few things that are inferior to Amaryllo products.  
1. The frames per second is at 3! This means the stream will be extremely choppy, and the lag time will be unbearable.
2. The contrast is all wrong.  It looks black and white even in a completely lit environment.
3. The lens angle is very narrow.








The Patio edition comes standard with a 4GB built in memory, however we decided to upgrade it to 32GB for our super early backers and to 16GB for our early backers.




Package includes a 2-meter-long AC power adapter




An optional ultra-high powered white LED light warns intruders that they are being watched and also provides extra light to capture the image of the culprit





What is it?
Amaryllo Live has 2 functions
1. For viewing your personal cameras via PC
Below are screenshots of the ""my private cameras"" page which allows you to access all your cameras via PC.  Even the 2way audio, alerts, remote control, and other functions are available through Amaryllo Live.





Below is an example of how you can view all your cameras at once on Amaryllo Live.  Previously, features like these were only available for expensive professional security systems.



2. For sharing cameras with the public
Below are examples of the public channels available at Amaryllo Live 


Below is a screenshot of a local restaurant that has a public camera.  You can follow, like, and share any public camera on social media.  On the right side you'll see a chat section where you can ask questions and make comments.



Below is a snap shot of that same restaurant seen on a 24"" screen.

Below is a video showing how you can move the camera in any direction. It's super convenient and easy to control.

How do I set it up?
We plan to have the setup procedure for the iSensor HD Patio the same as all our other products. 
The whole process takes only 1 minute if you know your WiFi password.  Our app will guide you through the steps with a simple QR code scan. 
Here is the instructional video for the iSensor HD:



What is the quality of the video?
The quality comes in HD, VGA or QVGA.
For recorded videos it depends on what quality you want the camera to use. This can easily be changed in the settings menu.
For the live viewing, the camera will automatically select the most appropriate quality based on your wifi bandwidth availability.  It will also adjust the quality to make sure the connection is stable and has minimal delay. 


Is there a warranty and user manual?
Yes, there is a paper manual that helps you through the setup procedures, but the digital user manual covers all other questions. 
We offer warranty on parts for one year after purchase.



What kind of WiFi connection speed do I need?
Our Cameras have built-in WiFi 802.11 bgn and both downloading and uploading speeds depend on your available bandwidth.
For HD, a minimum bandwidth of 1.7Mbps is recommended.


How long can I record video?  


World's Best 256-bit encryption?

We care about your privacy protection and that is why we employ 256-bit encryption, which is the same level of security as used by NSA, NASA, the Pentagon. With 256 bit encryption and Google's security network, AES permits the use of 256-bit keys. Breaking a symmetric 256-bit key by brute force requires 2128 times more computational power than a 128-bit key. 50 supercomputers that could check a billion billion (1018) AES keys per second (if such a device could ever be made) would, in theory, require about 3×1051 years to exhaust the 256-bit key space.
And you can rest assured that something like this doesn't happen with our camera's.

Can I use it outdoors?
Yes!
We designed the Patio specifically for outdoor use.  We've done extensive waterproofing tests as well as temperature tests in less than -20°C and the iSensor continues to function properly.
*See videos of waterproof and temperature tests in the story above!

Does it have night vision?
No, it doesn't have IR LEDs due to it's size.  It does feature an ultra high powered flashlight which will help distinguish objects and deter intruders. 
We recommend that you place the device in an area with existing patio lights.
