<h3>Pan American Tintype Survey</h3>
 
<p>In the spirit of Timmothy O'Sullivan and all other traveling wet plate photographers of 19th century I am going to travel across America and document it as I find it today.  This will be a new comprehensive overview American cultural and physical landscape.  I will be using the timeless wet plate collodion technique, producing tintypes and ambrotypes that will last for centuries to come.  While using this method each created image is completely hand-made and is entirely unique, as no two plates will ever look the same.  There is no negative in wet plate collodion - instead the light is captured directly upon a piece of aluminum or glass that just prior to exposure is prepped with collodion and bathed in silver nitrate and then developed before the emulsion has a chance to dry.  This requires having a darkroom within steps of the place where the photograph is captured and the darkroom inside The Photo Palace Bus is absolutely perfect for that purpose.   </p>
<p>  You might ask – why use this seemingly forgotten form of photography today?  For me the answer is simple: I chose it because of its easthetic beauty, level of concentration and skill required and distinctive quality of each photograph made.   Collodion images are known for their longevity and projected life of a well-crafted plate exceeds 200 years.  While changing owners they will delight many viewers who will experience them in exact same form as they left my hands.  </p>
<p>  While moving across the land I will also educate as many people as possible about history of photography and it's evolution through time.  I will raise awareness about the importance of hand-made images and encourage those who want to pursue artistic photography to continue working with traditional methods and use film.  To do this I will freely present the small, but comprehensive exhibit featuring over 25 different manual printing styles.  I will offer workshops and demonstration in various photo techniques and I will also learn from the more knowledgeable photographic artist I meet, after all – what is life without learning?</p>
<p>  The journey starts on June 9th, so as you are reading this I am already on the road, heading north from San Diego to Seatlle before cutting east toward Maine and then, closer to fall, south to Florida.</p>
<p>  Help me complete this historic journey – I truly appreciate Your support!</p>

<h3>Major Expenses in Need of Funding</h3>
<p>• <strong>Diesel</strong> - this is the MAIN expense.  It will take at least $7K in diesel alone to complete this run</p>
<p>• <strong>Chemistry and plates</strong> - shooting at least 200 plates of aluminum and glass and covering the chemistry needed for that is going to run another $1000-2000</p>
<p>Notice that the goal set by in this campaign is lower that the estimate of just the two major items listed above.   Note the absence of food, shelter and any extracurricular activities.  I hope that this campaign takes off and that all the expenses of traveling may be covered thanks to Your support. </p>

enough to experience the allure of travel and exploration of the 
American West. That yearning for freedom, adventure, and the open road 
has stirred in us once again. This time we’re determined to share the 
wonder together. We plan to spend these six-weeks driving many miles, living out
 of our tent and trekking through the wilderness on a photojournalistic 
mission to archive the current reality of the places and situations we encounter. <br/></p><h3>Our Route <br/>
</h3><h4>Beginning <b>Saturday, August 3rd</b>...</h4><p>Asheville, NC -&gt; Chicago, IL -&gt; Badlands NP -&gt; Yellowstone NP -&gt; Glacier NP -&gt; Seattle, WA -&gt; Olympic NP -&gt; Portland, OR -&gt; Crater Lake, OR -&gt; Redwoods NP -&gt; San Fransisco, CA -&gt; Big Sur, CA -&gt; Yosemite NP -&gt; Zion NP -&gt; Bryce Canyon NP -&gt; Arches NP -&gt; Durango, CO -&gt; Telluride, CO -&gt; Aspen, CO -&gt; Breckenridge, CO -&gt; Denver, CO -&gt; Memphis, TN -&gt; HOME.<br/></p><p>________________________________________________________________________<br/></p>
<p></p><p>We’re quite sure
 many of you reading this right now know this same yearning for adventure and exploration, whether it 
be in reflection of your own past epic adventures or through the 
planning of those yet to come, and it is in that universal spirit of 
wonder that we now ask you to share in ours. </p>Okay, you’ve done it, you've found the catch. Here is the part where we 
ask for your monetary support. Yes we are trying to recruit some crucial funds for equipment,
 gas and food<strong>. </strong><em>But,
 before we scare you off, as we do no think this exchange should be 
one-sided, we’d like to offer you some pretty wonderful items in return 
for your generosity. Check them out on the right side of this page!<br/></em><p></p><p>____________________________________________________________________</p><p><strong>WONDERING WHAT THESE IMAGES MIGHT LOOK LIKE? <br/></strong></p><p></p><p>At the conclusion of our trip we will create a curated gallery of images from which you can select your print.</p><strong></strong><p></p><p><strong>To check out the types of images you will be receiving please check out our storefront: <a href=""http://society6.com/COASTtwoCOAST"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://society6.com/COASTtwoCOAST</a></strong></p><p><strong style=""font-weight: bold;"">Or check out the Gallery section of this site.</strong><br/></p><p>(Note: these are examples from our past adventures, but reflect the style and scope of what you might receive)</p><p><strong></strong></p><p style=""display: inline !important;""><strong>____________________________________________________________________</strong></p><br/><p></p><h3><strong><p><b>OTHER WAYS YOU CAN HELP</b></p></strong></h3><h3>

On separate occasions prior to meeting we’ve both been fortunate 
enough to experience the allure of travel and exploration of the 
American West. That yearning for freedom, adventure, and the open road 
has stirred in us once again. This time we’re determined to share the 
wonder together. We plan to spend these six-weeks driving many miles, living out
 of our tent and trekking through the wilderness on a photojournalistic 
mission to archive the current reality of the places and situations we encounter. Our Route 
Beginning Saturday, August 3rd...Asheville, NC -> Chicago, IL -> Badlands NP -> Yellowstone NP -> Glacier NP -> Seattle, WA -> Olympic NP -> Portland, OR -> Crater Lake, OR -> Redwoods NP -> San Fransisco, CA -> Big Sur, CA -> Yosemite NP -> Zion NP -> Bryce Canyon NP -> Arches NP -> Durango, CO -> Telluride, CO -> Aspen, CO -> Breckenridge, CO -> Denver, CO -> Memphis, TN -> HOME.________________________________________________________________________
We’re quite sure
 many of you reading this right now know this same yearning for adventure and exploration, whether it 
be in reflection of your own past epic adventures or through the 
planning of those yet to come, and it is in that universal spirit of 
wonder that we now ask you to share in ours. Okay, you’ve done it, you've found the catch. Here is the part where we 
ask for your monetary support. Yes we are trying to recruit some crucial funds for equipment,
 gas and food. But,
 before we scare you off, as we do no think this exchange should be 
one-sided, we’d like to offer you some pretty wonderful items in return 
for your generosity. Check them out on the right side of this page!____________________________________________________________________WONDERING WHAT THESE IMAGES MIGHT LOOK LIKE? At the conclusion of our trip we will create a curated gallery of images from which you can select your print.To check out the types of images you will be receiving please check out our storefront: http://society6.com/COASTtwoCOASTOr check out the Gallery section of this site.(Note: these are examples from our past adventures, but reflect the style and scope of what you might receive)____________________________________________________________________OTHER WAYS YOU CAN HELP

<h2>I C E L A N D S C A P E S</h2>
<hr/><p>Icelandscapes is a photo project about the surpassing nature and surreal landscapes of Iceland. Last year I had the pleasure to travel through this unique country and tried to capture the beauty of this fascinating island.</p>
<p>Come with me on a journey through diversified locations full of wild nature. Feel the breath of the Earth at the caldera of Krafla, experience the immense power of water at one of the roaring waterfalls all over the country, immerse into a surreal world of glittering pieces of ice at the black sand beach of Jökulsárlón, get in touch with unbelievable soft moss that covers whole lava fields and watch the most funny and clumsy creatures of Iceland - Puffins.</p>
<p>All these impressions and many more will be part of the photo book Icelandscapes.</p>
<p><img alt=""Caldera at Krafla"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-pJ2x0Yi_xwk/UOcgZoEpJiI/AAAAAAAAKGc/5bVYFQbcJJA/w1118-h559-no/BreathingEarthAtNa%25CC%2581mafjall.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Caldera at Krafla""/></p>
<p><strong>Facts about Iceland</strong></p>
<p>Iceland is one of the youngest landmasses on earth, formed at about 20 million years ago due to volcanic eruptions on the Mid-Atlantic ridge. It is 103.000km<span>² in size and has a population of only 322.930 which makes it one of the world's most sparsely populated countries with merely 3.1 people per km². For comparison, Germany has <span>225 per km², the Netherlands <span>497 per km² and the United States <span>35 per km². Around two-thirds of the country's population lives in the capital city Reykjavik and its surrounding areas. The rest of Iceland is wild nature with lots of sand and lava fields, vulcanos, massive glaciers and the lifeblood of the island - glacial rivers flowing to the sea.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-byZaSYzxogY/UQI70bdPQ_I/AAAAAAAAKt4/z0-xd4MTWfU/w1118-h559-no/MightyGlacierTongue.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></span></span></span></span></p>
<p>What makes Icelands nature so special is that it changes its appearance from one moment to the other. You may stand in between mossy lava fields and as soon as you come around the next 'corner' you may stand right in front of a huge glacier tounge. Your eyes have barely time to rest because of all the impressions they have to deal with.</p>

<h2>Why I need your help</h2>
<hr/><p>I want to share my impressions of Iceland in a self published photo book and need your help to get it printed.</p>
<p>To get a good price for the book I need to print at least 500 copies, otherwise the production costs will be to much and the final book would be to expensive. Therefore I'm asking for your help to bring this project to life.</p>

<h2>I C E L A N D S C A P E S</h2>
<hr/><p>Icelandscapes ist ein Fotoprojekt über die unvergleichliche Natur und surreale Landschaft Islands. Letztes Jahr hatte ich das Vergnügen, durch dieses einzigartige Land zu reisen und die Schöhnheit dieser faszinierenden Insel festzuhalten.</p>
<p>Kommen Sie mit mir auf eine Reise durch verschiedene Gebiete voller wilder Natur. Spüren Sie den Atem der Erde in der Caldera von Krafla, erleben Sie die immense Kraft des Wassers in einem der rauschenden Wasserfälle im ganzen Land, tauchen Sie ein in eine surreale Welt aus glitzernden Eisstücken beim schwarzen Sandstrand von Jökulsárlón, kommen Sie in Berührung mit dem extrem weichen Moos, welches ganze Lavafelder bedeckt und beobachten Sie die lustigsten und ungeschicktesten Lebewesen Islands - Papageientaucher.</p>
<p>All diese Eindrücke und mehr, werden Teil meines Fotobuches Icelandscapes sein.</p>

<p><strong>Fakten über Island</strong></p>
<p>Island ist eine der jüngsten Landmassen der Welt. Entstanden vor etwa 20 Millionen Jahren durch vulkanische Eruptionen des mittelatlantischen Rücken. Island ist 103.000km² groß und hat eine Bevölkerung von nur 322,930. Damit ist Island eines der weltweit am dünnsten besiedelten Ländern mit nur 3,1 Personen pro km². Zum Vergleich: Deutschland hat 225 pro km², die Niederlande 497 pro km² und die Vereinigten Staaten 35 pro km². Rund zwei Drittel der Bevölkerung des Landes lebt in der Hauptstadt Reykjavik und Umgebung. Der Rest von Island ist wilde Natur mit viel Sand und Lavafeldern, Vulkanen, riesigen Gletschern und der Lebenadern der Insel - eisige Flüsse die Richtung Meer fliessen.</p>
<img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-byZaSYzxogY/UQI70bdPQ_I/AAAAAAAAKt4/z0-xd4MTWfU/w1118-h559-no/MightyGlacierTongue.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><p>Für mich liegt der spezielle Reiz an Island in der abwechslungsreichen und sich ständig ändernden Landschaft.

I C E L A N D S C A P E S
Icelandscapes is a photo project about the surpassing nature and surreal landscapes of Iceland. Last year I had the pleasure to travel through this unique country and tried to capture the beauty of this fascinating island.
Come with me on a journey through diversified locations full of wild nature. Feel the breath of the Earth at the caldera of Krafla, experience the immense power of water at one of the roaring waterfalls all over the country, immerse into a surreal world of glittering pieces of ice at the black sand beach of Jökulsárlón, get in touch with unbelievable soft moss that covers whole lava fields and watch the most funny and clumsy creatures of Iceland - Puffins.
All these impressions and many more will be part of the photo book Icelandscapes.

Facts about Iceland
Iceland is one of the youngest landmasses on earth, formed at about 20 million years ago due to volcanic eruptions on the Mid-Atlantic ridge. It is 103.000km² in size and has a population of only 322.930 which makes it one of the world's most sparsely populated countries with merely 3.1 people per km². For comparison, Germany has 225 per km², the Netherlands 497 per km² and the United States 35 per km². Around two-thirds of the country's population lives in the capital city Reykjavik and its surrounding areas. The rest of Iceland is wild nature with lots of sand and lava fields, vulcanos, massive glaciers and the lifeblood of the island - glacial rivers flowing to the sea.

What makes Icelands nature so special is that it changes its appearance from one moment to the other. You may stand in between mossy lava fields and as soon as you come around the next 'corner' you may stand right in front of a huge glacier tounge. Your eyes have barely time to rest because of all the impressions they have to deal with.

Why I need your help
I want to share my impressions of Iceland in a self published photo book and need your help to get it printed.
To get a good price for the book I need to print at least 500 copies, otherwise the production costs will be to much and the final book would be to expensive. Therefore I'm asking for your help to bring this project to life.

Der Fotograf
Mein Name ist Stefan Brenner und ich bin leidenschaftlicher Fotograf und Liquid Artist aus Wien (Österreich). Ich liebe es über die ganze Welt zu reisen, die Schöhnheiten unseres wunderbaren Planeten zu dokumentieren und meine Erlebnisse und Bilder mit anderen zu teilen.
Wenn Sie mehr über mich und meine Arbeit erfahren wollen, besuchen Sie doch meine Webseite unter www.stefanbrenner.com.
Dort können Sie auch einige meiner Liquid Art Bilder sehen. Diese zeigen kollidierende Wassertropfen welche im Bruchteil einer Sekunde spektakuläre Skulpturen und Formen bilden.

<p>I am Thomas Moon – a professional landscape photographer, avid explorer, and newly “ex-corporate” wilderness lover. After over a year of planning and overcoming a bit of fear, I took the leap last week to follow a new path and pursue my passion for landscape photography. Since this passion took hold in 2008, I have traveled over 200,000 miles exploring distant places around North America. Photographing nature and being in the wild has always excited me and I love sharing distant places with others. I am working hard to transition my career into photography with this first project and together we will be helping wilderness conservation groups with a portion of the proceeds from the project. I have saved up some money to get me started, but I can’t do this without your help.</p>
<p>Last week, the chains from my cubicle wall were officially unshackled and I have been working feverishly since to start this project!  I would LOVE for you to come along on this journey with me so that I can share the experience with as many people as possible and help protect the environment for other nature lovers.  <strong>Five percent of all proceeds will go to the Alaska Conservation Foundation (alaskaconservation.org) and Canadian Parks and Wilderness Society (cpaws.org) to help support efforts to protect the wilderness there for future generations.</strong></p>
<p>In return for your contribution, I will be sharing blog updates and digital galleries along the way, as well as other unique photo perks below. Your support will make this project a reality!</p>

This project is the first part of a series that will also encompass many of the National Parks in Canada including Banff/Jasper National Parks and the Gaspe Peninsula in Quebec later this summer/fall.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>  As an amateur photographer working and living in Big Bend National Park, in Texas, I was excited I found a way for me-- for us-- to use photography to help the tiny community across the newly opened border. Closed for over a decade, and still developing their ecotourism since the opening a month ago, Boquillas certainly holds some little seen beauty; here's a way to expose the beauty in a fun way, and help some good folks, as well!</p>
<p> Using the thirty disposable cameras (and two waterproof ones) the people of Boquillas have been taking pictures of what they love about Boquillas, what they'd like to show the world. Using these images, I'll create a photobook--or, lacking enough usable images, postcards-- that can be sold by the people of Boquillas to benefit the community, to pay for school computers/make a community room.   Even better: we'll be able to see a Boquillas most tourists will never see! (Towards that aim, and at the suggestion of some knowing folks close to me, I'll be posting them online, along with text, and will include a preview of that as a perk!) </p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>  My goal is to reach a minimum of two thousand dollars; that will repay me for the cameras and pay for the processing (we'll get two prints of each, so they'll be able to keep one, plus put the images on CD to manipulate for further use). On top of that is gas/housing as I commute to Boquillas (only an hour away from where I live, in the park, plus camping fees). I'd like to hire one of the young women to translate for me, as I interview the people who took the pictures; and, finally, money for a ""first run""of the product, whatever that is, photo book or postcards. </p>
<p><span>  Of the course, the most important perk is knowing you've helped put something in the hands of the village that can help them to become sustainable...but a little something is always welcome to show thanks, and so there are some cool little perks, from a printed image from the collected photos, to a handmade bracelet, to a special ""tour""of Boquillas for the most adventurous!</span></p>
<p>  Even if we don't reach the goal, the Project will move forward with my own funds: I'm too excited to stop!</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>  My first impulse towards creating this project was solely curiosity; what was there to see? As it developed, however, I became more excited about helping the village by facilitating a product that they could then produce, themselves, and generate funds for the community. From all my contact with the people of Boquillas, I have been of the impression that they are most interested in sustainability, and have worked hard at being independent; those are qualities I personally admire and wish to support. </p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Thank you for taking an interest! If all you do is help spread the word, by reposting in Facebook or emailing a friend, you've made a valuable contribution. Thank you!</p>

(Towards that aim, and at the suggestion of some knowing folks close to me, I'll be posting them online, along with text, and will include a preview of that as a perk!) 
 


What We Need & What You Get
  My goal is to reach a minimum of two thousand dollars; that will repay me for the cameras and pay for the processing (we'll get two prints of each, so they'll be able to keep one, plus put the images on CD to manipulate for further use). On top of that is gas/housing as I commute to Boquillas (only an hour away from where I live, in the park, plus camping fees). I'd like to hire one of the young women to translate for me, as I interview the people who took the pictures; and, finally, money for a ""first run""of the product, whatever that is, photo book or postcards. 
  Of the course, the most important perk is knowing you've helped put something in the hands of the village that can help them to become sustainable...but a little something is always welcome to show thanks, and so there are some cool little perks, from a printed image from the collected photos, to a handmade bracelet, to a special ""tour""of Boquillas for the most adventurous!
  Even if we don't reach the goal, the Project will move forward with my own funds: I'm too excited to stop!
 


The Impact
  My first impulse towards creating this project was solely curiosity; what was there to see? As it developed, however, I became more excited about helping the village by facilitating a product that they could then produce, themselves, and generate funds for the community. From all my contact with the people of Boquillas, I have been of the impression that they are most interested in sustainability, and have worked hard at being independent; those are qualities I personally admire and wish to support.

<p class=""p2"">As many of you probably already know, I am very fortunate to be in New Zealand right now, living out my dream of becoming a professional photographer.  I’ve been here since November working with two of the top New Zealand photographers in the wedding photography business, as well as getting the chance to work with different models and modeling agencies in Auckland (all while enjoying the perfect summer and beaches of Waiheke Island). Unfortunately my camera is slowly breaking and I know that soon it's just going to give out on me all together. While here I've been able to work with some of the best cameras and gear that are on the market right now. I've seen such a change in my work while using better equipment, and I can only imagine how much I might continue to improve if given the chance to upgrade my gear! So I've decided that instead of sending my camera in to be fixed, its time to bite the bullet and completely start over with my collection of gear (as well as switch from being a Nikon girl to a Canon… GASP!).  I'm so excited to be able to use what I've learned here and continue building up my own portfolio of work when I return from New Zealand in May.</p>

re bidin. Bingeha kar û xebatên vê kargeha me dildarî ye û pêdiviya me bi
alîkariyên we heye.</p>
<p><b>Bandora alîkariyên we dê çi bibe ?</b></p>
<p> Bi xêra alîkariyên we yên ku ji bo xebatên

alîkariya we dê bên kirrîn,ciwan û zarok dê bikarin bi wan makîneyan wêneyan
bikşînin û pêşnûmayên xwe pêk bînin.Çawa ku me ew kargeh bi alîkariyên wek

careke din li Roboskiyê komkujî pêk neyê em ê ji dengên wan re bibin deng. </p>
<p><b>Ji bilî vana hûn çawa dikarin alîkariya wan bikin ?</b></p>
<p> Ku derfetên we ji aliyê bûjenî ve tune bin ku

<p><b>GENÇLERİN ve ÇOCUKLARIN FOTOĞRAFLARI ile ROBOSKÎ PROJESİ </b></p>
<p>Türkiye’nin
en doğusunda Şırnak’a bağlı Roboskî köyünde 28 Aralık 2011 tarihinde sınır
ticareti yapan 19’u çocuk 34 insanımız; Türk Silahlı Kuvvetleri tarafından hava
saldırısı sonucu katledildi. Katliamdan sonra biz gönüllü fotoğrafçılar olarak
Roboskî’de yaşları 7 ile 17 arasında değişen 60 genç ve çocukla 6 ay boyunca
fotoğraf atölyesi yaptık. İstanbul, Diyarbakır ve Van’dan 25’e yakın gönüllü
fotoğrafçı atölyeye katıldı. Gençler ve çocuklar kendi yazdıkları hikayeleri
fotoğraflayarak katliam sonrası Roboskî’de yaşama tanıklık ettiler. Çektikleri
binlerce fotoğraf içinden atölyeyi yürüten fotoğrafçıların da desteğiyle
çocuklar tarafından hikaye seçkileri yapıldı. </p>
<p><b>Bize? Size? </b></p>
<p>Fotoğrafçı
gençler ve çocuklar atölyesini tamamen imece usulü ile başlattık, bu konuya
duyarlı insanların küçük katkılarıyla bitirdik. Kimi fotoğraf makinası
gönderdi, kimi ulaşımlarımızı karşıladı. Şimdi ise; 60 genç ve çocuğun yazdığı
43 hikaye ve çektikleri 600 fotoğrafı birçok şehirde sergilerle kamuoyu ile
paylaşmayı hedefliyoruz. Aynı içeriğe sahip üç dilli bir kitabın (Kürtçe,
Türkçe, İngilizce) 4000 adet basımı yapılacak ve 60 çocuğun kendi hikayelerini
anlattıkları mini - röportajların olduğu film dvd’si kitap içerisinde yer
alacaktır. Gönüllülük temelinde yürüttüğümüz atölye çalışmasının sonuca
ulaşması için yardımlarınıza ihtiyaç duymaktayız.</p>
<p><b>Desteğinizin etkisi ne olacak?</b></p>
<p> Çalışmaya vereceğiniz desteklerinizle; dvd
içeren kitap basımı gerçekleşmiş olacak. Ayrıca; alacağımız fotoğraf
makinalarıyla gençlerin ve çocukların bundan sonra çekecekleri fotoğraflarla
yapacakları projeler için bir katkı yapmış olacaksınız. Nasıl ki atölyeyi imece
yardımlarla tamamlamış isek, yapacağınız katkılar ile bu çalışmayı bitirmiş
olacağız ve Roboskî’de yaşananların bir daha yaşanmamasına ses vermiş
olacaksınız. </p>
<p><b>Bunun dışında nasıl yardımcı olabilirsiniz? </b></p>
<p>Eğer
maddi olarak destek olma imkanınız yoksa, bu kampanyanın daha fazla kişiye
ulaşması için; çevrenizdekilere duyurabilir, sitenin linkini gönderebilirsiniz.

GENÇLERİN ve ÇOCUKLARIN FOTOĞRAFLARI ile ROBOSKÎ PROJESİ 
Türkiye’nin
en doğusunda Şırnak’a bağlı Roboskî köyünde 28 Aralık 2011 tarihinde sınır
ticareti yapan 19’u çocuk 34 insanımız; Türk Silahlı Kuvvetleri tarafından hava
saldırısı sonucu katledildi. Katliamdan sonra biz gönüllü fotoğrafçılar olarak
Roboskî’de yaşları 7 ile 17 arasında değişen 60 genç ve çocukla 6 ay boyunca
fotoğraf atölyesi yaptık. İstanbul, Diyarbakır ve Van’dan 25’e yakın gönüllü
fotoğrafçı atölyeye katıldı. Gençler ve çocuklar kendi yazdıkları hikayeleri
fotoğraflayarak katliam sonrası Roboskî’de yaşama tanıklık ettiler. Çektikleri
binlerce fotoğraf içinden atölyeyi yürüten fotoğrafçıların da desteğiyle
çocuklar tarafından hikaye seçkileri yapıldı. 
Bize? Size? 
Fotoğrafçı
gençler ve çocuklar atölyesini tamamen imece usulü ile başlattık, bu konuya
duyarlı insanların küçük katkılarıyla bitirdik. Kimi fotoğraf makinası
gönderdi, kimi ulaşımlarımızı karşıladı. Şimdi ise; 60 genç ve çocuğun yazdığı
43 hikaye ve çektikleri 600 fotoğrafı birçok şehirde sergilerle kamuoyu ile
paylaşmayı hedefliyoruz. Aynı içeriğe sahip üç dilli bir kitabın (Kürtçe,
Türkçe, İngilizce) 4000 adet basımı yapılacak ve 60 çocuğun kendi hikayelerini
anlattıkları mini - röportajların olduğu film dvd’si kitap içerisinde yer
alacaktır. Gönüllülük temelinde yürüttüğümüz atölye çalışmasının sonuca
ulaşması için yardımlarınıza ihtiyaç duymaktayız.
Desteğinizin etkisi ne olacak?
 Çalışmaya vereceğiniz desteklerinizle; dvd
içeren kitap basımı gerçekleşmiş olacak. Ayrıca; alacağımız fotoğraf
makinalarıyla gençlerin ve çocukların bundan sonra çekecekleri fotoğraflarla
yapacakları projeler için bir katkı yapmış olacaksınız. Nasıl ki atölyeyi imece
yardımlarla tamamlamış isek, yapacağınız katkılar ile bu çalışmayı bitirmiş
olacağız ve Roboskî’de yaşananların bir daha yaşanmamasına ses vermiş
olacaksınız. 
Bunun dışında nasıl yardımcı olabilirsiniz? 
Eğer
maddi olarak destek olma imkanınız yoksa, bu kampanyanın daha fazla kişiye
ulaşması için; çevrenizdekilere duyurabilir, sitenin linkini gönderebilirsiniz.

ROBOSKÎ PROJECT WITH PHOTOS OF YOUNGSTERS AND KIDS
In the easternmost of
Turkey, in Roboskî, a village of Şırnak, 34 citizens of ours, 19 of whom are
kids and who do border trade were murdered by Turkish Armed Forces as a
consequence of an airstrike on 28th December 2011. After the
massacre we, volunteer photographer, did a photographer’s workshop with 60
youngsters and kids of whom the ages are between 07 and 17 for 6 months in
Roboskî. Almost 25 volunteer photographers who came from Istanbul, Diyarbakır
and Van attended the workshop. 
Youngsters and kids
witnessed the life in Roboskî after the massacre by photographing the stories
they wrote themselves. Anthologies of stories are created within thousands of
photos they took by youngsters and kids themselves with support of
photographers who carried out the workshop. 
TO US? TO YOU?
We
started workshop for photographer youngsters and kids completely as a
collective work and finished with little contributions of people who are
sensitive to this issue. Some sent cameras, while some paid for our
transportation. 
Now
we are aiming at sharing 43 stories written and 600 photos taken by 60
youngsters and kids with public opinion in many cities and exhibitions. 4000
press of a multilingual book (in Kurdish, Turkish and English) with the same
content will be printed and a DVD film in which short interviews with 60
children that they tell their stories will be included in the book. We need for
your support in order to complete this workshop that we held based on
voluntariness successfully. 
What will be the
reflection of your support?
With
the support you give for this Project, printing of the book including DVD would
be achieved. Additionally, you will be contributing for the projects of
children which they would carry out with their photographs in the future. We
will complete this Project with the help of your contributions you will make
just as we end the Project with collective and voluntary work. YOU WILL BE A VOICE AGAINST THE
RECURRENCE OF WHAT WAS ENCOUNTERED IN ROBOSKÎ!
Apart from these, how can you help us?
If you cannot give financial
support, you may let your acquaintances know about the Project and send the

<p>Hey there! I'm Naomi Figueroa, a wife, photographer, youth leader, traveler, follower of Christ, and lover of Latin America. I grew up in Maine, live in Pennsylvania, and love traveling to Central America whenever I can. </p>
<p>I'm so excited about this awesome opportunity that I have! I've been looking for ways to <strong>serve others and make an impact</strong> using my photography skills. This October (20th-27th), I’ll be heading to Guatemala for a week to do humanitarian photography work for <a href=""http://www.casasito.org/html%20ingles/sobrecasasitoingles.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">CasaSito</a>, a non-profit organization whose mission is to increase educational opportunities in rural areas so that those living in poverty can attend school and obtain skills they need to improve their lives.</p>

<h3>What Difference Will It Make?</h3>
<p><span>I’ve had the chance to visit Guatemala 3 times and have been to various parts of the country. It is such a beautiful and unique country with one of the highest indigenous populations in Central America. While I’ve been struck by its unique beauty, I’ve also met some really beautiful people who lack access to clean water, health care, and education. According to the CIA World Factbook, “More than half of the population is below the national poverty line…poverty among indigenous groups, which make up 38% of the population, averages 73%.” In addition, the literacy rate among adults is only about 70%. </span></p>
<p> </p>

<p><span>I </span>can write all these things, but what<strong> connects us</strong> is knowing individuals, not statistics.</p>
<p><span>I believe that photographs that tell a story can have an impact that reaches deep into a person’s heart. Images capture more than just a visual representation of a person or place; they give the viewer a sense of what it feels like to experience that moment or know that individual. Photographs are an <strong>integral part of communicating the needs of a non-profit</strong> and encouraging supporters to take part in their mission. My <strong>vision</strong> in working with CasaSito is to <strong>connect potential supporters to the impact of their work by communicating stories of hope and transformation through genuine, compelling photographs</strong>. </span></p>
<p><span>Your support of this project can continue multiplying as CasaSito uses the images to tell stories on their website, newsletters, and other communications and to connect people from around the globe to the impact of their work. In other words, <em>through your support and my partnership with CasaSito, we’ll be helping to provide education for many children who need it.</em></span></p>
<h3>What I Need &amp; How You Can Help</h3>
<p>In order for me to be able to go and serve, I need your help! I know that not everyone is able to GO, and not everyone is able to GIVE. However, if you are someone who has the means to give towards my trip and/or equipment costs, however large or small, it would mean so much to me to be given the chance to go.</p>
<p>If you would like to give towards <span>equipment costs</span>, you can <a href=""pledges/new"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">donate online RIGHT HERE</a> on IndieGoGo! (Be sure to check out <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/Guat2012"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">my facebook page</a> if you want details on giving towards my travel costs). </p>
<p>If I don’t raise all of these funds, I will still be able to go and do some great work. However, the following items are things that will make my work much easier, safer (being able to backup files while I’m there), and will be used for many future trips as well.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<ul>
<li>Hello, my name is Star Montana and I am a photo-based artist from Boyle Heights, California. I have been working on my Masters of Fine Art at USC for the past two years, which has been an emotional rollercoaster. I am the first person in my family to graduate from college and I will be the first in my family to get a Masters degree.</li>
<li>For the completion of my Masters of Fine Art (MFA), I am required to create an MFA solo exhibition, in which I create a whole new body of work that has required me to put in many hours for the last two years to conceptualize this new exhibition.</li>
<li>In order to fully execute the exhibition, I realize I would need to seek out the help of my community for more funding than I have. I have dedicated myself mostly to my education these last two years and slowed down my freelance career.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<ul>
<li>I am creating a photo exhibition that has installation throughout it so I will need to frame many of my images. Right now my framer estimate's a minimum $2,000 for my frames. I will need atleast $1000 for photo printing and $500 for material to build part of my installation (that is a surprise). </li>
<li>I will be adding different Perks for Donations that are above $10 asap.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<ul><li>I really believe in this exhibition and I am so proud of myself for making it this far through my education, the hardest part now is finishing my exhibition and getting the funding to achieve this goal.</li></ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<ul>
<li>It's always super hard to create a campaign for me because I am a prideful person that feels she's can do it alone but realistically, I cannot fund this exhibition alone. I am a struggling student/artist/human. I have so much love from my family but we are poor and as much as they would love to help me right now, they cannot help me financially at all. I am super grateful I have a large network that has helped me in the past and I hope can help me this time. </li>
<li>My biggest risk and challenge is that if I cannot get funded, my exhibition will be low quality and not be up to my standard. I have worked so hard for the past two years in Graduate school to get here at the finish line and now that I am here I want to finish with an amazing exhibition that I have dreamed of for years. The most beautiful part is I will be finishing my Master's Degree in Los Angeles so many of you can come to see and witness my show first hand in person, which wasn't possible during my first graduation in New York.</li>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p></p>
<p>My name is Amira Abusrour, I'm a Palestinian refugee living in Palestine, I'm 26 years old and I have a BA from Birzeit university in business administration. I work in Alrowwad Cultural and Theater Society (ACTS) which was established in 1998 in Aida refugees camp-Bethlehem, Palestine, as a project coordinator.</p>
<p><a href=""http://www.alrowwa.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.alrowwad.org</a></p>
<p>In ACTS we work with Palestinian children, youth and women. We have five units one of which is Images for life (IFL) - the media unit.</p>
<p>IFL is a great unit representing a backbone activity in ACTS which started in 2001. It provides training in photography and video for children and youth, and produces photos and films that are shown and exposed locally and internationally. This unit includes training courses as well as a diploma training certified by the Palestinian Ministry of Media.</p>
<p> ACTS has partnered, among others, with the French Consulate in East Jerusalem, the Hoping Foundation, the Holy See and UNRWA, The Netherlands Representative Office, ArtVenture (ArtAction) and Ashoka. In addition, ACTS was the first to start</p>
<p>- Annual outdoor film festival in Palestine since 2005, with screening on the Wall of separation surrounding Aida camp,</p>
<p>- Moving movies with cinema screening tours in the Occupied West Bank refugee camps and villages since 2007.</p>
<p>- A monthly and weekly Film screening in Alrowwad.</p>
<p>At  ACTS we believe that media is a powerful communication channel to tell the people the truth, that's why in Images For Life,  we give the Palestinian people the chance to be behind the cameras telling their own story instead of being always in front of it and others telling the story according to what they feel or see, in IFL we give the human being the chance to express oneself and to show one’s life, frustrations but also hopes and dreams.</p>
<p>Why I need your help?!!</p>
<p>At ACTS we offer most of our services and trainings for free for the people in Aida refugee camp, and this is the case for IFL courses, we have a new group of student from the UNRWA school in Aida camp, who are participating in a training in photography. We have the cameras and the trainer and the place but what we miss is the money to make a photo exhibition for the kids' work at the end of the training, since most of the children feel disappointed when they finish the training without having a ceremony with a photo exhibition to show their good work to their friends, families and for everyone. We sometime have a funded photography courses but not within the last three years, and that's why we stopped making the photo exhibitions because of lack of funding.</p>
<p>I believe that these talented kids have a lot to give and they are really great. </p>
<p><b>You can see a lot of the photos taken by our students here: </b></p>

<p><a href=""http://www.alrowwad.org/index.php/photo"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.alrowwad.org/index.php/photo</a></p>
<p>  I'm doing this to create a chance for the Palestinian refugee kids in Aida camp and surrounding areas to help them go over all the ugliness of violence by the Israeli occupation incursions in a place that lack playground or green spaces or entertainments facilities, to help those kids show their beauty, express themselves and be the first strong step towards changing the stereotyped images about Palestinians and Palestine.</p>
<p>Be our partner in drawing a smile of pride and dignity on the faces of our talented young children.  </p>
<p> Be a Change maker and help us in continuing to create a change in the world.</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p><i>To make this dream happen, I need at least $4000, to cover :</i></p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p></p>
<p>If you decided to be part of this , you will create a chance for the Palestinian refugee kids in Aida camp and surrounding areas to help them go over all the ugliness of violence by the Israeli occupation incursions in a place that lack playground or green spaces or entertainments facilities, to help those kids show their beauty, express themselves and be the first strong step towards changing the stereotyped images about Palestinians and Palestine.</p>

My name is Amira Abusrour, I'm a Palestinian refugee living in Palestine, I'm 26 years old and I have a BA from Birzeit university in business administration. I work in Alrowwad Cultural and Theater Society (ACTS) which was established in 1998 in Aida refugees camp-Bethlehem, Palestine, as a project coordinator.
www.alrowwad.org
In ACTS we work with Palestinian children, youth and women. We have five units one of which is Images for life (IFL) - the media unit.
IFL is a great unit representing a backbone activity in ACTS which started in 2001. It provides training in photography and video for children and youth, and produces photos and films that are shown and exposed locally and internationally. This unit includes training courses as well as a diploma training certified by the Palestinian Ministry of Media.
 ACTS has partnered, among others, with the French Consulate in East Jerusalem, the Hoping Foundation, the Holy See and UNRWA, The Netherlands Representative Office, ArtVenture (ArtAction) and Ashoka. In addition, ACTS was the first to start
- Annual outdoor film festival in Palestine since 2005, with screening on the Wall of separation surrounding Aida camp,
- Moving movies with cinema screening tours in the Occupied West Bank refugee camps and villages since 2007.
- A monthly and weekly Film screening in Alrowwad.
At  ACTS we believe that media is a powerful communication channel to tell the people the truth, that's why in Images For Life,  we give the Palestinian people the chance to be behind the cameras telling their own story instead of being always in front of it and others telling the story according to what they feel or see, in IFL we give the human being the chance to express oneself and to show one’s life, frustrations but also hopes and dreams.
Why I need your help?!!
At ACTS we offer most of our services and trainings for free for the people in Aida refugee camp, and this is the case for IFL courses, we have a new group of student from the UNRWA school in Aida camp, who are participating in a training in photography. We have the cameras and the trainer and the place but what we miss is the money to make a photo exhibition for the kids' work at the end of the training, since most of the children feel disappointed when they finish the training without having a ceremony with a photo exhibition to show their good work to their friends, families and for everyone. We sometime have a funded photography courses but not within the last three years, and that's why we stopped making the photo exhibitions because of lack of funding.
I believe that these talented kids have a lot to give and they are really great. 
You can see a lot of the photos taken by our students here:

  I'm doing this to create a chance for the Palestinian refugee kids in Aida camp and surrounding areas to help them go over all the ugliness of violence by the Israeli occupation incursions in a place that lack playground or green spaces or entertainments facilities, to help those kids show their beauty, express themselves and be the first strong step towards changing the stereotyped images about Palestinians and Palestine.
Be our partner in drawing a smile of pride and dignity on the faces of our talented young children.  
 Be a Change maker and help us in continuing to create a change in the world.



What We Need & What You Get
To make this dream happen, I need at least $4000, to cover :
*The rent for the place ( a hall ) for a week , we need nearly $500.
* The cost of printing out the photographs:
- 15 photos with the size of 30*45 cm ($10/per photo)
- 40 photos with the size of 50*70 cm ($28/per photo)
- 5 photos with the size of 50*140 cm ($83/per photo)
- 20 photos with the size of 20*60 cm ($17/per photo)
A total of $2025
* The decoration materials for the photo exhibition we need nearly $250.
*The publicity and  advertisement  for the photo exhibition ( Posters, Banners, ext...) and the invitations we need nearly $1500.
* The  reception  in the opening of the exhibition we need nearly $225.



The Impact

If you decided to be part of this , you will create a chance for the Palestinian refugee kids in Aida camp and surrounding areas to help them go over all the ugliness of violence by the Israeli occupation incursions in a place that lack playground or green spaces or entertainments facilities, to help those kids show their beauty, express themselves and be the first strong step towards changing the stereotyped images about Palestinians and Palestine.
You will be a partner in drawing a smile of pride and dignity on the faces of our talented young children.  
You will be a Change maker and you will help us in continuing to create a change in the world.
Making this photo exhibition happen will help in giving those kids the opportunity to celebrate their success and to see their efforts turned into real work which is seen and noticed by everyone. This will encourage them and other kids to join the photography courses and improve their skills instead of wasting their time in doing nothing in the streets. 
 on this website you will see more of our work and you will know more about us, we are working in the field of culture and art since 1998, and we have a lot of success stories and events www.alrowwad.org

<p style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Arial, sans-serif; color: rgb(42, 42, 42); letter-spacing: normal; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"">The advantage of a RAW or NEF  Format Image over Jpeg is that it contains a lot more information. The disadvantage is that a RAW file ranges in the 25-30mb per image! A full event can easily amount to over 20-40 gigabytes of RAW images. Add to that video, several export formats plus back ups.....memory rapidly doubles up.</p>
<p style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Arial, sans-serif; color: rgb(42, 42, 42); letter-spacing: normal; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"">A RAW file is always recoverable, it is adjustable to many extents and can be modified to take on a number of different looks and styles. Raw files allow the images to be manipulated in many different ways and is generally the preferred shooting format for photographers.</p>

Video.
Each event will have a 15 to 25 minute video clip including a flycam ride through all areas, start line action, pit lanes, boxes, atmosphere, crowd, event highlights and standings. These clips can be expected days after each event.
At the end of the season there will also be an All Events Documentary covering the season from start to finish, with backstage and season highlights. expected 90min.
Photography.
Each team will have their very own gallery featuring all of their images throughout the season at each of the events. So each teams gallery will grow as the season moves on. Team on my ""To Watch List"" are edited and uploaded first.


Why pledge you when I edit and publish for free?

There are 2 reasons....the first is the size.

        640px - 70% quality - large logo VS  6000px - 100% quality - small logo



 
The second is that there will simply be no more images created as its impossible for me to carry on without some sort of funding
2015 calendars will be sent during and immediately after campaign ending
  Small Pledges Make Big Things Happen!
Choosing a Pledge will also get you perks in return. All perks have calendars and passwords to thousands of full size posters. These are good as full size prints (1,5m orig) for your garages or as gifts for team members.




Here are some samples of images from 2014 where I covered my first three races. Bechyne - Hoskovice - Hockenheimring (There are currently 208 individual galleries from three races plus a further 100+ teams still in sorting and editing)
The Beauty of Raw Files
The advantage of a RAW or NEF  Format Image over Jpeg is that it contains a lot more information. The disadvantage is that a RAW file ranges in the 25-30mb per image! A full event can easily amount to over 20-40 gigabytes of RAW images. Add to that video, several export formats plus back ups.....memory rapidly doubles up.
A RAW file is always recoverable, it is adjustable to many extents and can be modified to take on a number of different looks and styles. Raw files allow the images to be manipulated in many different ways and is generally the preferred shooting format for photographers.

I was born in Kingston, Jamaica, in 1952, and arrived in London ten years later to reside with my mother. After leaving school in 1968 my first job was with Kodak where I developed a deep and passionate love for the craft of photography. 
In 1974 I returned to Jamaica on a short visit and by a stroke of luck was hired as second-assistant stills photographer on the movie The Marijuana Affair which was produced by Lucien Chen a wealthy Chinese-Jamaican who in 1973 promoted a world heavyweight title fight between George Foreman and Joe Frazier in Kingston. </p><p></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""435"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2F0B6DFDUzigk%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3D0B6DFDUzigk&amp;image=http%3A%2F%2Fi1.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2F0B6DFDUzigk%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube"" width=""580""></iframe></div><br/><p></p><p>It was during this time in Jamaica I made close acquaintance with Bob Marley at his home, and after a year in Jamaica, I left on travels to west Africa. I crossed the Sahara Desert from Algeria into Niger, unto Burkina Faso, Ivory Coast and then into Ghana where I would live for one year. After leaving Ghana I made further travels to Togo, Benin and in January 1977,  I arrived in Lagos, Nigeria, to attend the black arts festival, FESTAC. </p><p></p><p><b><i><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/542181/files/20140429064647-PETODONALD9.jpg?1398779207"" src="""" style=""""/></i></b></p><p></p><p>During this time in Lagos I became friends with the legendary Afro-Beat King Fela Ransome Kuti and whilst spending time in his home, renegade soldiers arrived and infamously burnt the house to the ground. They brutally abused everyone including Fela's mother, Fela and myself and I would spend five months being detained by the military government on the pretext of being a CIA spy but specifically because of my friendship with Fela. </p><p>In late 1977 I returned to Jamaica and assisted in managing Diplomat, a major photographic studio in Kingston. The following three years were dramatic in the history of Jamaica and during this period I captured a wealth of images.  I also became the unofficial house photographer at the Marley's home with the assistance of Mr Neville Garrick and Mr Colin Leslie, two of Bob Marley's closet confidantes. I worked on Survival the worlds first Rastafari newspaper published by Marley in the summer of 1980 and in September that year I left for the United States with Bob on his final tour Uprising. This though was short lived due to his illness and after his demise in 1981, I spent the following three years freelancing in New York and Los Angeles. I would also attend the West Los Angeles Community College to study media studies but did not finish the course. </p><p></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""435"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FrDD5mZDxmRc%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DrDD5mZDxmRc&amp;image=http%3A%2F%2Fi1.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FrDD5mZDxmRc%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube"" width=""580""></iframe></div><br/><p></p><p>In 1985 I returned to London and began working with the Caribbean Times newspaper.

The book is of high quality containing 300 pages, 240 black &amp; white photographs, over 4,000 words transcribed from Bob Marley interviews and contemporary in look and appeal. Quality is the goal. The book is entertaining, newsworthy and thought-provoking and will appeal to a broad readership because no book like it is available on the market today. The manufacturing or printing cost was agreed between Bookbinders of London Ltd and myself. Bookbinders of London is a family-owned printing company which has been in business for over 150 years and who are still working in the same building.

I was born in Kingston, Jamaica, in 1952, and arrived in London ten years later to reside with my mother. After leaving school in 1968 my first job was with Kodak where I developed a deep and passionate love for the craft of photography. 
In 1974 I returned to Jamaica on a short visit and by a stroke of luck was hired as second-assistant stills photographer on the movie The Marijuana Affair which was produced by Lucien Chen a wealthy Chinese-Jamaican who in 1973 promoted a world heavyweight title fight between George Foreman and Joe Frazier in Kingston. It was during this time in Jamaica I made close acquaintance with Bob Marley at his home, and after a year in Jamaica, I left on travels to west Africa. I crossed the Sahara Desert from Algeria into Niger, unto Burkina Faso, Ivory Coast and then into Ghana where I would live for one year. After leaving Ghana I made further travels to Togo, Benin and in January 1977,  I arrived in Lagos, Nigeria, to attend the black arts festival, FESTAC. During this time in Lagos I became friends with the legendary Afro-Beat King Fela Ransome Kuti and whilst spending time in his home, renegade soldiers arrived and infamously burnt the house to the ground. They brutally abused everyone including Fela's mother, Fela and myself and I would spend five months being detained by the military government on the pretext of being a CIA spy but specifically because of my friendship with Fela. In late 1977 I returned to Jamaica and assisted in managing Diplomat, a major photographic studio in Kingston. The following three years were dramatic in the history of Jamaica and during this period I captured a wealth of images.  I also became the unofficial house photographer at the Marley's home with the assistance of Mr Neville Garrick and Mr Colin Leslie, two of Bob Marley's closet confidantes. I worked on Survival the worlds first Rastafari newspaper published by Marley in the summer of 1980 and in September that year I left for the United States with Bob on his final tour Uprising. This though was short lived due to his illness and after his demise in 1981, I spent the following three years freelancing in New York and Los Angeles. I would also attend the West Los Angeles Community College to study media studies but did not finish the course. In 1985 I returned to London and began working with the Caribbean Times newspaper. I also taught photography on the Broadwater Farm Estate in Tottenham, north London, scene of an infamous and notorious civil riot. The next fifteen years I worked exclusively as a freelance photographer with my work being published in the Daily Mail, Time Out magazine, the Observer, The Voice, West Indian Digest and Which magazine. In 2012 I was asked to submit photographs which were prominently featured in the Kevin Macdonald feature documentary, MARLEY. In August 2013 I successfully self-published Portrait of a Legend and other Folks which represents thirty five years of work. This book probably features some of the last unpublished photographs of the legend Bob Marley and is a testament to my vision and a personal reflection of my photographic culture.I ask for your support in what has been a long campaign and I thank you in advance.One Love.Lindsay Oliver Donald.Preface:In logic, it is accepted that an assumption is a proposition that is taken for granted as if it were true based upon presupposition without preponderance of the facts.

The book has had an initial print run and is directed at lovers of photography, Bob Marley, reggae music, Jamaican culture and other folks. POALAOF is targeting a total sale of 4,900 copies during three years. Publishing is a high profit and high margin business and the key to success will be successful marketing.

The book also has a commitment to be a platform to profile Jamaican artistry and features a variety of international musicians and iconic celebrities. The book will encourage and provide role models representing artistic and professional excellence.

I recently visited Jamaica and presented a copy each to the Jamaican National Archive and to the Bob Marley Museum in Kingston.Start-up Summary: Start-up capital has been achieved and Portrait of a Legend and other Folks was successfully launched in the presence of the Jamaican High commissioner to London, Her Excellency Mrs.  Aloun Ndombet-assamba, at the Jamaican High Commission in August 2013. Capital is now required for the production of 5,000 copies and this pitch is being made to positive investors and the finance raised will enable full-scale production and marketing of 4,900 copies of Portrait of a Legend and other Folks. It can be assured that additional capital will not be required in the future.Ownership and Location Facilities: As the founder of POALAOF, a sole-trader self publishing venture, I currently own ninety percent of its value and use my home as an office which is located at:50 Burlington Gardens Acton LondonW3 6BAUKTel:+4407535901630 e-mail: linkuplindsay@yahoo.co.uk My home/office is equipped and functional and it is not anticipated that expanded facilities will be needed for this plan.

<p>In 1991 I published the book “Living With The Enemy,” the culmination of 10 years documenting domestic violence.

<p>Recently I met Margo, who left her abuser before irreparable damage was done to her daughters. She could not continue to raise her girls in the hell that her angry, abusive and wealthy husband created. Despite what seemed from the outside an enviable lifestyle, Margo took the most difficult and vital step -- without much money, taking her daughters,  Margo left Jack, knowing that any alternative would be better than accepting a life of abuse.</p>
<p>Her amazing courage has inspired me to create a body of work that captures the fulfillment many women find after leaving their oppressors and taking control of their own destinies. I want to make portraits and record more stories of people who bravely struggle to transform their reality. </p>
<h3><strong>Credentials</strong></h3>
<p>For two decades my photographs and voice have inspired campaigns to stop domestic violence.  The photographs have improved public awareness and raised much needed funds for direct services, public policy advocacy and, the chance for a better life. I have worked with governors, senators, police chiefs, the U.S. Army, numerous foreign governments including the Czech Republic, Germany, Italy, Bolivia, Portugal, Peru, the American Medical Association, and, hundreds more grassroots groups to galvanize people across the world to take a stand against domestic violence.</p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://sphotos.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ash3/582669_249928125124485_677166485_n.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>In 1992 the Childcare Action group in NYC was auctioning off a tea party with Hillary Rodham Clinton. It was the month before the 42nd presidential election. I am not<br/>a wealthy woman, but, I've been known to be able to raise funds for something that matters. In a heartbeat, I convinced every person of means to open their pockets and help me win that meeting with Hillary.    </p>
<p>Bringing notable leaders from the domestic violence community, I used the opportunity to talk with Hillary about what I'd witnessed and what needed to change.  What Hillary Clinton said to us back then has taken me twenty plus years to fully digest -- ""while we can change laws and try to provide protection from abusers, significant change will only really occur when women themselves take responsibility to break free of their violent lives.""</p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://sphotos.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-snc7/391412_249928298457801_199113082_n.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<p>There. I said it. This is what it's all about.</p>
<p>Everyone must step up to the plate.  I believe by raising up the voices of the bravest and most inspirational examples, like Margo, we will show that life with plenty of love without abuse is possible.</p>
<p>For all these reasons I'm asking for your support. It's degrading to all if we choose to do nothing.</p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://sphotos.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ash3/580989_249928158457815_506888327_n.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<h3>Impact</h3>
<p>Everything I know comes from taking pictures which have helped real good people in real bad situations see the positive results of changing their lives. ""I Am Unbeatable"" the book project, is about the power of photography.</p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/322522/pictures/full/20120709143634-Diamond88.jpg?1341869796"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>When the Unbeatable book is finished it will inspire a social change in the way we think and talk about domestic violence. It will encourage more decisive action. The book will feature stories and images of courageous people who jumped out of the frying pan into the cool waters of love and acceptance. There is nothing better than being loved for who you are, not the ""thing"" somebody else wants you to be. I believe this project will inspire a radical change in self awareness and show the way to walk like an Egyptian.  </p>

For two decades my photographs and voice have inspired campaigns to stop domestic violence.  The photographs have improved public awareness and raised much needed funds for direct services, public policy advocacy and, the chance for a better life. I have worked with governors, senators, police chiefs, the U.S. Army, numerous foreign governments including the Czech Republic, Germany, Italy, Bolivia, Portugal, Peru, the American Medical Association, and, hundreds more grassroots groups to galvanize people across the world to take a stand against domestic violence.

In 1992 the Childcare Action group in NYC was auctioning off a tea party with Hillary Rodham Clinton. It was the month before the 42nd presidential election. I am nota wealthy woman, but, I've been known to be able to raise funds for something that matters. In a heartbeat, I convinced every person of means to open their pockets and help me win that meeting with Hillary.    
Bringing notable leaders from the domestic violence community, I used the opportunity to talk with Hillary about what I'd witnessed and what needed to change.  What Hillary Clinton said to us back then has taken me twenty plus years to fully digest -- ""while we can change laws and try to provide protection from abusers, significant change will only really occur when women themselves take responsibility to break free of their violent lives.""


There. I said it. This is what it's all about.
Everyone must step up to the plate.  I believe by raising up the voices of the bravest and most inspirational examples, like Margo, we will show that life with plenty of love without abuse is possible.
For all these reasons I'm asking for your support. It's degrading to all if we choose to do nothing.



Impact
Everything I know comes from taking pictures which have helped real good people in real bad situations see the positive results of changing their lives. ""I Am Unbeatable"" the book project, is about the power of photography.

When the Unbeatable book is finished it will inspire a social change in the way we think and talk about domestic violence. It will encourage more decisive action. The book will feature stories and images of courageous people who jumped out of the frying pan into the cool waters of love and acceptance. There is nothing better than being loved for who you are, not the ""thing"" somebody else wants you to be. I believe this project will inspire a radical change in self awareness and show the way to walk like an Egyptian.

<h3>My Story</h3>Hello, my name is David E. Kelly, and I am a sports and entertainment photographer who has been involved in a copyright violation law suit where a person(s) committed business identity theft by making a business card that said he owned my legal business name ""Big League Photos."" Then he scanned one of my creative works and printed over 50,000 counterfeit posters, t-shirts and other products without my consent and distributed them throughout retail vendors across the United States. I could not get law enforcement in Arizona to stop these criminals.They all seemed to pass the buck and left me alone to do their investigative work where I spent 5 years uncovering the copyright thief's paper trail and found the counterfeits being sold in over 100 vendor locations throughout the USA where they reaped millions of dollars from the sales and distribution of the Photo-Poster ""Remembering September 11, 2001."" (Please visit the website <a href=""http://www.thestolenimage.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.thestolenimage.com</a>)<br/><br/><p><br/></p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The impact is that my equal protection rights were violated by legal authorities, as well as a violation of copyright infringement by the criminals and their enjoined associates.This incident negatively affected my career as a photographer. I had to spend a great deal of time (9 years), energy and money to track down the criminal and the vendors, while being disrespected by law enforcement agencies during this entire ordeal. My business has lost millions of profits that were earned from the illegal counterfeiting and sales by the vendors and copyright thief.This crime has exhausted me, and caused a great deal of hardship. However, I am recovering with spiritual counseling and the help of God Almighty. I have since produced thousands of other photographs that are worthy of sharing with the rest of the world, and hope to start publishing more of them soon.<br/></p>

</div>
<div>
<h3>What Is Needed To Help Seek Justice<br/>
</h3>I have decided to file a federal lawsuit in the United States Federal District Court of Arizona to protect my copyright from further being violated, and to help protect United States citizens from criminal frauds who operate as ""angels in disguise."" Unfortunately, I cannot afford attorney fees, so I have to file ""Pro Se"", which means to represent myself. There are costs associated with filing this case and incidental expenses that must be met as the case moves along in the federal courts. However, to reach this goal I must accumulate funds to print and frame some of the other photography works that I have captured over the years to auction and sale to raise the capital I need to represent myself in court. Your help will allow me to register and apply to festivals as a vendor to display my creative photography art. A good copyright lawyer is hard to find in Arizona, especially one that will work on a contingency basis or file this case as a pro-bono one. If you know of any lawyer that is interested in helping me to seek justice, feel free to contact me asap.  <br/><br/><p><br/></p>

</div></div>","Our Story
Here I am today. 
Two passports in my pocket and a yearning… all I’m missing is a ticket to the
border and some extra for the show for you when I return. 
As an artist, the border of exchange of heritage, art and culture within
the context of unifying Europe, is the place to be.  
My goal is to document the
landscape of cultural diversity on the Polish eastern
border with Lithuania.


In my recent work, I returned
to simple forms of line, light and color. The inspiration for this
project comes from the images of where the water stops and the line
begins.  From the edge of the
water, through the line set in motion, I arrived at the borderline.  It is the process of creative
discovery, the confrontation of my memory, and images of the past with today’s
reality.  

I plan to visit  the remote town of Sejny where
the Borderland Foundation has been an active voice since1990 and through the direct experience of working at the
border make a personal connections with people.  The Borderline
Foundation is an ideal place to start, and
participating in the opening of the International Center for
Dialogue in Krasnogruda, the family estate of the
Nobel prize winning Polish poet Czeslaw Milosz would give me an understanding of changes along the border. The International Center for
Dialogue in Krasnogruda was donated and supported by Czeslaw Milosz and will open on June 30, 2011
which marks the hundredth anniversary of his birth. It is about 10km from the Lithuanian
border.  
The landscape of cultural
diversity experienced by Czeslaw Milosz has been transformed by history, but it
‘s still embraces Polish, Lithuanian, Belarusian and Jewish traditions of the
region.  I plan to spend two weeks documenting
the community along the
border. As a fluent Polish speaker and experienced documentary photographer I
will focus on a small local community as
an example of microcosm for more global coexistence.


In response to global threats arising
from the rebirth of old ethnic and religious conflicts and a growing hostility
to the “Other,” the Borderline Foundation serves as
a worldwide model for cross-cultural dialogue. I want to know more about them.   
 
For over 20 years I have worked as a
professional photographer in documentary, journalism, portraiture and fine art
photography.  My commitment to
documenting the diverse communities in Chicago stands from my strong belief that through art and cultural exchange we can break down the
forces that separate us.  When I photograph, I am searching for meaning. The resulting image goes
beyond remembrance.  A photograph
has the powerful ability to expose hidden truths in the everyday world. It
points to a detail and asks the viewer to extrapolate the mystery, or simply to
find what is human in all of us.

Many thanks for your
financial support in making this trip and exhibition possible. 

 


The Impact
As a Polish American photographer and artist,
my hope is to extend Milosz’s celebration in Poland to America, the country
that was his home away from home. His influence on my life as
an immigrant, artist and intellectual has profoundly informed my journey.
I’m confident that an exhibition will enhance the ideas of Milosz’s dialog and
contribute to an understanding of a global vision of tolerance and respect for
“otherness.”  There are many forces that separate us from each another.  The microcosm of one community or one event can
impact the larger world by serving as an example or as a possibility of what
may be. It is my belief that images, in their universal
appeal and ready recognition, can help bridge these boundaries of the
mind. 
""…jakby to co minęło
nie było całkiem minione dopóki trwa w pamięci pokolen  - czy tylko w pamieci jednego kronikarza.”
 (Czesław
Miłosz)
…the past is never lost as
long as it remains in memory of generations – or just memory of a single
observer.” 


What We Need & What You Get
My goal is to prepare 20 photographs
for an exhibition in Chicago and Poland.  
 

The $4000 Budget is divided
into two parts.  The first is for travel and related
expenses for visiting Poland during the month of June and July 2011. The
second is for printing, framing and mounting an exhibition in Chicago in October 2011.

$2000  airfare and travel expenses  
$2000 printing, framing and
gallery expenses

<p>Recently, I was inspired to start a community photography project, which I named FOCAL POINTS.  FOCAL POINTS is a collection of both color and black &amp; white photography, which documents everyday citizens of the city of Syracuse, their thoughts, and their photographic interpretations on violence, injustice and/or racism in America.  FOCAL POINTS also includes captivating black &amp; white photography from the “1 Million Hoodie March” from Armory Square to Clinton Square on Friday, March 30, 2012 in Syracuse, which was sparked by the outrage surrounding the Trayvon Martin case.</p>
<p>I am humbled by the positive responses from the Syracuse community.  FOCAL POINTS has been selected for display with several organizations in the Central New York Region.  The Crowne Plaza Hotel  &amp; Conference Center Syracuse has also graciously agreed to be the sponsoring hotel for the Opening Reception, which will take place in their Lafayette Room on Thursday, May 31, 2012 from 5:30-8:30 PM.</p>

I am humbled by the positive responses from the Syracuse community.  FOCAL POINTS has been selected for display with several organizations in the Central New York Region.  The Crowne Plaza Hotel  & Conference Center Syracuse has also graciously agreed to be the sponsoring hotel for the Opening Reception, which will take place in their Lafayette Room on Thursday, May 31, 2012 from 5:30-8:30 PM.
I would be grateful you would be willing to sponsor the FOCAL POINTS exhibit as a patron with a donation of $20.00.  The names of all patrons will be listed in the opening reception program. 
Thank you for your consideration and support.",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<p>BRINN has decided that the days of boring camera bags are over because you, my dear, are far from boring. You're chic. Our mission at BRINN is to create an ethical luxury camera bag &amp; accessory line for the movers and thinkers of the world. Created by a photographer, for photographers, every aspect of our first prototype has been consciously and purposefully thought out. Our products were designed to solve a problem - BRINN is an idea, a space for style to meet functionality. We strive for authentic and genuine design and what sets us apart is our approach. Unlike our competitors, our androgynous line has a style for everyone. No more bulky, masculine or one of the same design camera bags. Our products are always designed with YOU in mind. Now we need your help to bring it to life.</p>

<p>The interior of our bags are padded with a deluxe faux fur and lined with velvet for a soft padding and luxe look &amp; feel. With plenty of space for your 15"" laptop, notebooks, extra batteries and most importantly, your cameras and lenses, BRINN will carry the workload for you. Going on a weekend getaway? All camera compartments are completely adjustable and removable, making your bag adaptable for any adventure. </p>

</div><div>
<p>Our products are made from a durable and water-resistant vegan leather to keep your belongings dry and concealed no matter where you go. Our padded straps come equipped with a pocket to hold your metro card or train ticket and another to carry spare change. Our quick access side pocket allows you to grab what you need when you need it. </p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<ul>
<li>So far, we at BRINN, have our first prototype made. We want you along the ride with us and to watch us grow. The bag you are seeing pictured is the Rebel Rebel bag. It is the first out of five designs from our very first collection. It's more than we can ever have imagined and we love it so, but as all first prototypes, there are a couple of changes to be made. We have been field testing the bag for months and know exactly what tweaks need to be done to make it just right for you. We will be personally paying for all the fabrics and materials needed but we still need $12,000 to adjust the bag and as well as have all 5 samples produced. The funding will be going to altering our patterns, having new patterns made as well as actually making all of the samples. </li>
<li>As a photography brand, we always want to support upcoming and established artists! Our founder, Ciara Perrone, is a photographer, Asbury Park local as well as a Parsons the New School for Design graduate. It is important to her to use this campaign to showcase great talents that she has met along her journey by offering photographic prints by a curated group of photographers as one of the perks (coming May2017). There are only a limited number of these perks available, so please act fast and check out our featured artists work further!</li>
<li>Should we not reach our goal, the funds will still be directly used for the advancement of BRINN. If the money we raise during this campaign only slightly covers our costs for samples, that is still where the money will go toward. We will not stop no matter what happens and in the end, will not disappoint any of you. Should we exceed our goal, the extra money will be put towards getting our first collection manufactured! If you have any questions during or after this campaign about where exactly the money will go, please feel free to reach out to us anytime at hello@brinnbags.com and we promise to respond to you promptly.<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1491439723/g1wieffjtcuanr1khi75.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<ul>
<li>Lets face it: When we look good, we feel better. But don't write BRINN up to be just a fashion accessory. BRINN is changing the way we feel about work gear. It's fun, stylish, ethical, functional and always evolving to fit your needs. </li>
<li>Know what you wear: BRINN is made from all vegan materials. Our products are cruelty free and while sourcing materials, we are always looking for the next best solution to be more sustainable.</li>
<li>Our samples will be produced by one of the top handbag manufacturers in NYC and we have worked closely with them since day 1 of our prototype to ensure the fabric choices and decision to detail are what will work best for our designs. We will remain by their sides throughout the sample making process.</li>

Our goal is 50,000!  If we do not receive 1000 pre-orders by the time the campaign ends, you will be refunded within 5-7 days after the end of the campaign and we will not print.  </p><p>We are working with the same professional designer and local professional commercial printer we used for the 2020 calendar to minimize risk. We have the photos, we have a printer, we have the U.S. Post Office. Even with prudent, conservative planning, issues always arise. There are always risks of unforeseen delays, accidents, catastrophes, meteor strikes, alien invasions from the 2nd galactic quadrant in the Milky Way Galaxy, etc.  Thus, there may be delays in mailing the calendar to you. We have built in a lot of time to the project to make sure you have the calendars in-hand before the winter 2020 holiday season. Also, if this blows up, and we obtain 20,000 or 50,000 or 100,000+ supporters, that may delay the fulfillment and shipping. Rest assured, we are preparing for that blessing if it happens, but just in case delivery is delayed, please forgive us.</p><p>We are committed to this printing. If for some reason we are unable to print the final product, you will be refunded. Contact anyone who has worked with us or endorsed us. We are upstanding guys and will take a loss ourselves if needed to make anyone whole.</p><p><strong>COVID repercussions?</strong> Who knows at this time. Our lives are changing daily and we have no idea what conditions will be in September during our planned time to print.  Will costs go up/down? Will we be able to print? Will there be significant delays? We will plan for those contingencies as best we can and deal with them as they arise. Worse comes to worse, we refund everything and we don't print. </p><h3>About Us (the people creating and selling the calendar)</h3><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1583250521/g4qo3incyyvkhoydntzc.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: center;"">L-R: Don and John</p><p>The <strong>Seneca People</strong> honored <strong>William Pryor Letchworth</strong> with the name <strong>Hai-wa-ye-is-tah, ""he who does the right thing.""</strong> We aim to do the same.

John treasures living so close to so many Finger Lakes Region landmarks and loves to showcase them on his digital Facebook page where his reach routinely tops the two million mark each month. John’s images capture the beauty of the Finger Lakes Region and surrounding counties as no other. His images elicit emotions of awe, pride, remembrance, and beauty.

Our goal is 50,000!  If we do not receive 1000 pre-orders by the time the campaign ends, you will be refunded within 5-7 days after the end of the campaign and we will not print.  We are working with the same professional designer and local professional commercial printer we used for the 2020 calendar to minimize risk. We have the photos, we have a printer, we have the U.S. Post Office. Even with prudent, conservative planning, issues always arise. There are always risks of unforeseen delays, accidents, catastrophes, meteor strikes, alien invasions from the 2nd galactic quadrant in the Milky Way Galaxy, etc.  Thus, there may be delays in mailing the calendar to you. We have built in a lot of time to the project to make sure you have the calendars in-hand before the winter 2020 holiday season. Also, if this blows up, and we obtain 20,000 or 50,000 or 100,000+ supporters, that may delay the fulfillment and shipping. Rest assured, we are preparing for that blessing if it happens, but just in case delivery is delayed, please forgive us.We are committed to this printing. If for some reason we are unable to print the final product, you will be refunded. Contact anyone who has worked with us or endorsed us. We are upstanding guys and will take a loss ourselves if needed to make anyone whole.COVID repercussions? Who knows at this time. Our lives are changing daily and we have no idea what conditions will be in September during our planned time to print.  Will costs go up/down? Will we be able to print? Will there be significant delays? We will plan for those contingencies as best we can and deal with them as they arise. Worse comes to worse, we refund everything and we don't print. About Us (the people creating and selling the calendar)L-R: Don and JohnThe Seneca People honored William Pryor Letchworth with the name Hai-wa-ye-is-tah, ""he who does the right thing.""

In a short time, John has been fortunate to capture several viral and iconic images ranging from Ice Houses seen across the world to Finger Lakes Region waterfalls and so much more. John treasures living so close to so many Finger Lakes Region landmarks and loves to showcase them on his digital Facebook page where his reach routinely tops the two million mark each month. John’s images capture the beauty of the Finger Lakes Region and surrounding counties as no other. His images elicit emotions of awe, pride, remembrance, and beauty. His captivating images and historical narrative have been used by regional, domestic and international media regularly. A viral sensation due to a love of the Finger Lakes beauty & history and a passion for photography & drone flying (both self-taught). John's images and descriptions tell a story - a story rich in beauty, history, and traditions of today and yesterday.""John Kucko, as an ardent fan of Letchworth State Park, was an early supporter of The Autism Nature Trail (The ANT).  He believes -- as we do -- that natural beauty should be shared, which he accomplishes through his stunning photography. John shows integrity in his profession as a journalist, his visual story-telling as an influencer and his inclusive philanthropy as a human being.  We are so grateful for John's generosity in directing proceeds from the sale of his 2021 calendar to The ANT, a nature trail for all in the #1 state park in the country!""-Loren Penman, Co-Chair for The ANT, Genesee Region Parks CommissionFollow John:

<p><b>What I am doing...</b></p>
<p>My name is Leah Beach and I am a photographer from Delaware in the US. I started photographing people with Alzheimer’s Disease in 2011 while I was still attending art school. My great grandmother, Treva Yohe, was a patient at Brandywine Assisted Living in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware and I thought I would photograph her to try to discover more about her disease. As I began my exploration of the disease, I thought my work would be photographing people waiting to die, but it became so much more. My work became photographing these amazing people as they lived with Alzheimer’s and Dementia. At that time, I also realized that I needed to show people around the world how different cultures treat this disease. Dementia is something that affects everyone. It could be affecting someone you love, or perhaps it is something you are terrified of developing in your golden years. </p>
<p>I searched for many different avenues of funding over the last couple of years, applying for various grants and consistently being turned down for two reasons: lack of work or lack of experience. I’ve been told its a powerful idea but an idea is not quite enough to prove that I am worth investing in. So I figured that I should try to start this project on my own. I found Global Vision International in 2013 and worked to save funds to do a volunteer program with them in 2014, in rural Shimoni, Kenya with hopes of getting access to people with dementia within the community. I had no idea that that hope would become a reality. </p>
<p>I spent a day on Wasini Island, in a very rural village called Mkwiro photographing undiagnosed people who showed signs of Dementia. I am not a doctor, so I can not say these people have the disease but after spending so much time in nursing homes in the US, I identified shocking similarities between the patients. They give you this look like they are looking through you, not at you. That's the best way I can describe it. I learned so much about the patients in the village from their families and those who would describe their lives. These experiences sparked an expanded mission to travel to rural villages and nations around the world to share these peoples stories.</p>

<p><b>My Goal of This Project</b></p>
<p>Currently, I have been working with the Alzheimer’s Association of Kenya to gain knowledge about work they are doing to help people living with this disease. If I can get the funding from this Indegogo page From Mid- March until Mid- May Im going to photograph in rural communities, facilities in Nairobi, and to live with a Masai Tribe to photograph within their village as well. With these photographs I will have a cohesive body of work showing both sides of my project, people living with Dementia in progressive and rural areas so that I can work on getting the funding to start the world wide project. By that point I will have the photographic work and experience to back this project.</p>
<p>After getting adequate funding, the overall goal is to travel the world to the most isolated villages and communities to photograph people with different forms of dementia. I would work with each countries Alzheimer’s Association (most countries have one) to receive all of the information and guidance that I could need. I also plan to photograph the most progressive treatment methods as well to juxtapose how people are living with dementia around the world.  </p>

<p>After the overall project is completed I would exhibit this work, publish a book and provide all participating Alzheimer’s Associations free use of the images for their organizations. I also would work to create nursing outreach programs for these rural areas with proceeds from the project. </p>

<p><b>Why I Need Help</b></p>
<p>I am currently in need of funding to do my work in Kenya, which is why I created this Indegogo account. The funds raised here will go to pay for my airfare, from Scotland to Nairobi and Nairobi to the United States, living and travel expense, as well as funding the Masai tribe so I have access to them. Though it will be a tight budget, I will need exactly this amount to make this time possible. </p>
<p>If the fund of $5,000 is not achieved I will edit my time in Kenya to fit the budget of what I can raise. If for some reason I do not raise enough money to realistically and successfully finish my project, all money raised will be returned.</p>

That being said, photography equipment is incredibly expensive! I would really like to be able to expand the available services to my clients by having the ability to shoot unique head shots, stunning portraits as well as have the consistent availability to photograph the concept imagery that you might be used to seeing from me. Currently, I am renting all of the things I need to complete the paid sessions—which basically means I still shoot for close to nothing. I am currently using only one light for most of my images—and that has a great deal of limitations. Since I have rarely charged for my work in the past, I need your help to get the rest of the gear needed to bring these additional services to the clients of RWphotographics—and have them done RIGHT. These funds will allow me to purchase the equipment I need to provide not only better work, but more of it. <br/><br/><p></p><p></p><h4>Here is what I need:</h4>(4)- Einstein Flash Heads: $500/each<br/>(4)- 13' Heavy Duty Light Stands: $70/each<br/>(4)- CyberSync Transeivers: $30/each<br/>(2)- 10""x36"" Foldable Strip Boxes with grids: $150/each<br/>(2)- Vagabond Mini Lithium Power Packs: $240/each<br/>(2)- Vagabond Mini Lithium Batteries: $90/each<br/>(1)- CyberSync Commander: $180<br/><p>(1)- InterFit Double-Sided Collapsable Background: $80<br/>(1)- 22"" Beauty Dish with grid: $130<br/></p><div>

</div></div>","The Short of it:I shoot for the love of the art—not for money. That being said, photography equipment is incredibly expensive! I would really like to be able to expand the available services to my clients by having the ability to shoot unique head shots, stunning portraits as well as have the consistent availability to photograph the concept imagery that you might be used to seeing from me. Currently, I am renting all of the things I need to complete the paid sessions—which basically means I still shoot for close to nothing. I am currently using only one light for most of my images—and that has a great deal of limitations. Since I have rarely charged for my work in the past, I need your help to get the rest of the gear needed to bring these additional services to the clients of RWphotographics—and have them done RIGHT. These funds will allow me to purchase the equipment I need to provide not only better work, but more of it. Here is what I need:(4)- Einstein Flash Heads: $500/each(4)- 13' Heavy Duty Light Stands: $70/each(4)- CyberSync Transeivers: $30/each(2)- 10""x36"" Foldable Strip Boxes with grids: $150/each(2)- Vagabond Mini Lithium Power Packs: $240/each(2)- Vagabond Mini Lithium Batteries: $90/each(1)- CyberSync Commander: $180(1)- InterFit Double-Sided Collapsable Background: $80(1)- 22"" Beauty Dish with grid: $130
(1)- 47"" Foldable Octa Box with grid: $225(1)- 15"" MacBook Pro for image editing/client viewing (currently working on a mid-2007 iMac that just can't keep up): $2800


If I Hit My Goal:
I will do an incredibly embarrassing dance of joy, then lose sleep by shooting photos until I pass out. I will pick up all the gear on my list and book paid photo sessions (hopefully with relative ease).

What You GetSeeing as this project is all about photography, I thought the perks should be as well!  In addition to making my dream come true to have a mobile studio so that I can provide an variety of options for my clients, take a look at the panel to the right to check out the perks by level of support! Are you in need professional head shots for work? Want to update your modeling portfolio? Always wanted to do a themed concept photo shoot? Among the other rewards for your donation, I am offering a 2-hour photo session and full editing of your top 5 picks for $350 (must be within a 90-mile radius of Orlando, FL). I will bring the studio to you! Click here to check out my work on FacebookClick here to check out my website

 ""Do not dream our lives, living our dreams""
 
 
""And if we went for a drive Photographic Road Trip of the most iconic U.S. highway to create a book with unique pictures!""
 
 

 
 
Route 66 is a dream, I want to tell in pictures!!Pictures of places, characters, nooks and crannies and everything that makes the history of Route 66 .... pictures you have not seen .... all in a beautiful book with photos ROLLNSTEF KUSTOM ART PICS will you eyeful !!!!!
 
 
 My goal is to publish a limited edition book. To do this I need to raise at least 6,000 EUR. The more money I raise the nicer the book can be. Many details during printing and binding separate a good book from a great book and I want this to be a great book of THE ROUTE 66.
 


 

 
 
Stéphane photographer in the middle of the Kustom Kulture under the name ""ROLLNSTEF"". Passionate United States and more specifically the years pre-65's.
 
 

 
 
 
 
I was developing a personal technique in my photographic work, mixing photography, painting and Kustom Kulture.
 
 

 
 
My goal is to ask yourself if it is a photographic work, a painting, photomontage, etc. ....
 
 
 
 

You can find my photographic work and give you an idea of my world and what will be the imagine book project on Route 66! See here:https://www.facebook.com/pages/Rollnstef-ART-Ku...


 
What we need and what you get
 
A budget of 6000 euros we've needed to fund:    

 
- Travel autotour Route 66 (Flight A / R, hotels, rental car) for me and my other half will lead (so I could jump out of the car at every opportunity) and then she has a level of English better than mine !    
 
 
 
-The creation of the book ""ROLLNSTEF ART ROUTE 66"" andwe have to make about 500 copies.
I found an amazing book printer right here . They specialize in beautiful photography books, and I will be working with them to create a high quality art book. It will be a hardcover gem that will really hold its own on bookshelves and coffee tables, and it will feature all of my favorite images from my road trip 66 .All books will be  personally signed and as a limited edition. I plan to publish the book after this crowdfunding project.
 
    
 
- All secondary expenses: travel expenses (gas / etc)                                                      Photo equipment                                                      production photos.
 

- And if you are very generous, there will be further contributions that you can see in the project news!


 
Your contribution will make the difference !!!!!!!
. If the 6,000 EUR goal is reached all rewards will be immediately sent at the end of road trip. All books will be sent  (during thethird quarter of the year 2013).
You can donate with your typical credit cards (Visa and Mastercard) or with PayPal account. So it is so easy for everyone :-) The Perks you get for your contribution are on the right side (6 grey rectangles). 
I want to pay tribute to the MOTHER ROAD!

 
 
I want to travel, meet people, places, and make a photo book that makes you want people to come and discover.
 
 
 
So motivated as ever, I contacted the iconic characters of the ROUTE 66: 

 - Mr DELGADILLO!! The latter fought for the survival of his hometown, which necessarily going through the preservation of Route 66. Having spent his entire life in his ""barber shop"" shaving indigenous and travelers, he founded with his brother, the first association of rehabilitation of Route 66 in 1987.

 
 
 
 - Mr Michael Wallis Specialist Route 66, Wallis wrote more than 14 books on the subject! 
 
- Mr Ken TheLandrunner! It is the origin of Historic Route 66 Artwork Document.



 
 
You see, we just need your participation so that I can meet my idols !!!!!!!

The Impact
 
As the next generation of talented commercial photographers, we want to introduce ourselves to the UK's creative industries and put Derby firmly on the nation's cultural map. We are now lucky to live in a time where technology allows us the opportunity to be based anywhere in the world, so we would appreciate the help of supporters, friends, collaborators and clients across the UK and further afield as we raise funds for our photographic showcase. This is a huge opportunity for us, and we would like to thank you for your help as we take our first steps out of university and towards our future careers, whether they be as photographers, picture editors, retouchers, curators or any of the exciting opportunities open to us through our degree.
 
What We Need & What You Get
We need 3100 pounds for gallery hire, and whilst we have done well and had a lot of fun with our three fund-rasing events (the 'Santa and the Grinch' Christmas party, a pub quiz and 'The Lost Chick' Easter party) there is still a long way to go to reach our total. 
We will of course also require funds for printing, framing and then transporting our work from Derby to London, as well as advertising, marketing and all the little things needed to get an exhibition up and running. 
 
What we can offer you varies from a big thankyou on Twitter and a hand-written note, to a print of your choice, and a private pet photo shoot if you live anywhere near Derby or Sheffield. 
If you would like to help with any specific aspect of the fund-raising as a sponsor then please get in touch.

<h3>So, back here again! </h3>
<div>Basically what is happening is this: I am in Cape Town, South Africa with most of my project completed. 8 out of 10 stadiums have already been photographed, as well as the cities which host them: Bloemfontein, Pretoria, Rustenbeg, Johannesburg, Polokwane, Nelspriut, and Cape Town. The only two stadiums and cities I have left to visit are Port Elizabeth and Durban. Now, given that these 2 places are located quite some distance from Cape Town (660km and 1270km respectively), the ability to actually travel and photograph these 2 cities is dependent on the fiscal resources at my disposal. Which at the moment are close to being exhausted. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>This is where you can step in, a being enshrined in a savior light, mounted on kindness and cloaked in goodwill. The truth of the matter is that it would be a terrible shame to leave South Africa with this project only partially completed, especially after all the time, effort, and hope that not only I, but all the people who have helped to get me here in the first place, have put in. </div>
<div><br/></div>

<div>As a note, Indie Go Go has a minimum goal of 500 USD that you can set, but according to my calculations the trip to Durban will cost between 300 and 350 USD, so I will put up the 150 USD difference from what is left of my funds, because I only want to ask for what is absolutely necessary. </div>
</div></div>","So, back here again! 
Basically what is happening is this: I am in Cape Town, South Africa with most of my project completed. 8 out of 10 stadiums have already been photographed, as well as the cities which host them: Bloemfontein, Pretoria, Rustenbeg, Johannesburg, Polokwane, Nelspriut, and Cape Town. The only two stadiums and cities I have left to visit are Port Elizabeth and Durban. Now, given that these 2 places are located quite some distance from Cape Town (660km and 1270km respectively), the ability to actually travel and photograph these 2 cities is dependent on the fiscal resources at my disposal. Which at the moment are close to being exhausted. 

This is where you can step in, a being enshrined in a savior light, mounted on kindness and cloaked in goodwill. The truth of the matter is that it would be a terrible shame to leave South Africa with this project only partially completed, especially after all the time, effort, and hope that not only I, but all the people who have helped to get me here in the first place, have put in. 

So to put it extremely bluntly, and with the utmost respect to the reader, I need the bare minimum of money to be able to take a bus to Durban, spend the night and photograph, and then travel to Port Elizabeth and do the same there. 

Any contribution of any kind would go a long way to ensuring that this project gets completed, and completed in the way that it was originally intended, and doesn't fall by the wayside.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>My name is Tony.  I am a photographer from Joliet Illinois.  I am passionate about photography and what it does.  An image can speak a thousand words.  I want to use photography to raise awareness of forgotten people.  We see them everyday.  Walk past them on the street and never think twice.  They are somebody's brother, sister, mother, father, son, daughter, etc.  </p>
<p>I want to make a book of portraits that not only has images of the forgotten people, but interviews of their life story.  I want to learn how they got where they are, are they trying to get out of their situation, how will they do it. etc. </p>
<p>Help me tell their story and raise awareness. <span>On any given night, approximately 750,000 men, women, and children are homeless in the US.</span></p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>My goal is to reach $10,000.   I own all the equipment that I need to take the photos, so I will not be purchasing new gear with the funds.  I will be using it for my travel expenses to different cities.  Some of the funds will go to the homeless people themselves to gain access to their stories, feed them etc.   I will also be using a huge portion of the fubds to make the books.  </p>
<p>By contributing to my goal you will get some perks. From a digital image from the book with the story of the person photographed, a 11x14 print of an image from the book, to a copy of the book itself.  </p>
<p>This book will be unique in many ways.  One way is the cover.  The title of the book is ""Inside the Box"" and the binding of the book will be a cardboard box.    </p>
<p>If I do not reach my goal, funding will still go towards the project.  I will just have to do less interviews and print less books.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Do you want to help make a difference?</p>
<p>Help me raise awareness...  Your contribution will help tremendously in my quest to change the world.  If my book gets published I will donate a percentage of proceeds will go towardshomeless charities. (percentage and charity or charities have yet to be determined)</p>

Mana galvenā aizraušanās vienmēr ir bijusi fotografēšana, taču nopietni tai ķērties klāt nav sanācis, it īpaši, mācību dēļ. No sākuma aizrāvos ar dabasskatu foto un makro, bet vēlāk pārgāju uz cilvēku un portretu fotografēšanu.</div>
<div style=""font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10px;"">Lai nu kā, dzīvoju mazā Baltijas valstī - Latvijā. Valsts nav no tām lielākajām, kā arī pie mums nav nedz augsto kalnu, vulkānu un citu dabas brīnumu, tomēr mēs esam īpaši ar to, ka esam viena maza nācija, kas spējusi izdzīvot uz šīs pasaules pēc visiem tiem daudzajiem kariem un tautām , kas nākušas un valdījušas pār mūsu zemi, piemēram, vācieši, krievi arī zviedri. Ikviens no tiem, kas te bijis, ir atstājis kādu piemiņu, vai tā būtu pils vai drupas. Industrializācijas procesā daudzas pazīstamas ainavas ir tikušas iznīcinātas (Staburags), abi Paules kari, kuros Latvija bija diezgan nopietns karalauks, nav gājuši secen. Taču arī šobaltdien ir atrodami visādi noslēpumi mūsu plašajos mežos, smilšainajā krastmalā, mazajās pilsētiņās- katrā no novadiem.</div>

<p>Brauciens iekļauj visas labākās pilis, lielākās Latvijas pilsētas un arī interesantas vietas, kas ir apslēptas masu tūrismam. Šērsojot Kurzemi, Zemgali un Vidzemi, Latgali.</p>
<p>Fotografēt gribu visdažādākajos laikapstākļos, lai redzētu saullēktu un miglu, dienasgaismas spožumu, vakara <em>zelta stundu </em>un nakts mēnesgaismu.</p>
<p> Vēlos vairumu no vietām apmeklēt šovasar, bet rudenī un ziemā to, ko nepaspēšu vai arī būs tā vērts gadalaika dēļ.</p>
<h2>Kam vajadzīgi līdzekļi?</h2>
<ul>
<li>Automašīnas degvielai, sabiedriskajam transportam.</li>
<li>Ieejas biļētēm muzejos, nacionālajos parkos, visdažādākajās apskates vietās.</li>
<li>Lētai viesnīcai, kur pārlaist nakti, ja esmu kaut kur ļoti tālu.</li>
</ul><p>Ja izdosies sasniegt mērķi:</p>
<ul>
<li>Kā minēju mini aprakstā, man šobrīd ir parasta spoguļkamera Nikon D60, kuru lietoju jau kādus 4 gadus. Jau kādu laiku sapņoju par jaunu kameru, ir šis tas iekrāts, taču nepietiek. Arī naktīs nesanāk tik tīras bildes, kā vajadzētu, jo parādās <em>troksnis.</em> Jauna kamera noteikti palīdzētu arī turpmākai izaugsmei (taču man ir visai labas lēcas, statīvs utml. ).</li>
<li>Nopirktu arī ND filtrus, lai var padarīt krāsas labākas bez ""fotošopa"".</li>
</ul><h3><strong>Kāpēc man tas ir svarīgi?</strong></h3>
<p>Šobrīd pavadu iespējams vienu no pēdējām sava mūža vasarām, kad nestrādāju. Vēlāk būs vienmēr vai nu mācības vai darbs un nebūs laika kam tādam. Vēlos radīt ko paliekošu priekš tiem, kas aizbraukuši no Latvijas darba meklējumos. Kā arī daudzi tūrsti ir labākajā gadījumā redzējuši tikai daļiņu Rīgas. Ar attēlu palīdzību varētu piesasitīt lielāku interesi par citām pilsētām un dabu aiz Latvijas centra.</p>
<p><strong style=""font-size: 1.17em;"">Jūsu ieguldījums</strong></p>
<p>Noteikti palīdzēsiet nest Latvijas vārdu pasaulē un parādīt iecienītos tūristu apskates objektus jaunā gaismā, kā arī, kas to lai zina, iespējams radīt jaunas tūrsma vietas! Arī palīdzēsiet man izveidot jaunu fotogrāmatu un kalendāru ar labākajām bildēm, kuras uzņemšu savās gaitās.</p>
<p>No tā, ko esmu redzējusi Latvijā, zinu, ka arī šajā valstī ir nenovērtētas vietas!</p>

<h2>Hello! </h2>
<p>I would like to ask for your help in my campaign. My name is Ilva and I am 19 years old. My main hobby has always been photography, though previously I have never had time to seriously do anything due to studies. I strated as nature photographer, but later evolved more into portraiture.</p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://fc00.deviantart.net/fs70/i/2013/104/b/f/dim_woods_by_ilva_r-d5c8snu.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Dim woods""/></p>
<p style=""margin-left: 300px;""><strong><em>Dim woods, 2009</em></strong></p>
<p>I live in a small Baltic country named Latvia(Lettland, Латвия). Though, country is small and we don't have epic landscapes like high mountains, gaisers, volcanoes and so on, we are special as beeing a one small nation, which could survive on this Earth even after we have been conquired and ruled by many nations such as Germans, Russians and Swedes. Everyone have left some memorable landmarks and shaped Latvia as it is now. Though, a lot of interesting sights have been destroyed by industrialising process and by both WW, when Latvia was one of the main battlefields. There is still a lot to see and tell, for example, secrets that lay in dense forests, totally walkable by foot sand coastline, famous art-noveau Old town in Riga etc.</p>

<p><strong><em>I would like to make a photographic journey around my motherland and capture all the nature's beauty and historical sights that I can find.</em></strong></p>
<p>My trip includes traveling around all mayor cities in Latvia, castles, national parks and interesting, hidden to mass tourism landscapes. Starting from Kurzeme to Zemgale, later Vidzeme and Latgale regions.</p>
<p>Will be shooting at all kind of times to see morning dawn and fog, daylight brightness, evening's golden hour and night's moonlight.</p>
<p>Road trip is going to start this summer and last until end of year with some breaks. To get the most out of each season.</p>

Sveicināti!
Vēlos lūgt jūsu palīdzību manā projektā. Mani sauc Ilva un man ir 19. Mana galvenā aizraušanās vienmēr ir bijusi fotografēšana, taču nopietni tai ķērties klāt nav sanācis, it īpaši, mācību dēļ. No sākuma aizrāvos ar dabasskatu foto un makro, bet vēlāk pārgāju uz cilvēku un portretu fotografēšanu.
Lai nu kā, dzīvoju mazā Baltijas valstī - Latvijā. Valsts nav no tām lielākajām, kā arī pie mums nav nedz augsto kalnu, vulkānu un citu dabas brīnumu, tomēr mēs esam īpaši ar to, ka esam viena maza nācija, kas spējusi izdzīvot uz šīs pasaules pēc visiem tiem daudzajiem kariem un tautām , kas nākušas un valdījušas pār mūsu zemi, piemēram, vācieši, krievi arī zviedri. Ikviens no tiem, kas te bijis, ir atstājis kādu piemiņu, vai tā būtu pils vai drupas. Industrializācijas procesā daudzas pazīstamas ainavas ir tikušas iznīcinātas (Staburags), abi Paules kari, kuros Latvija bija diezgan nopietns karalauks, nav gājuši secen. Taču arī šobaltdien ir atrodami visādi noslēpumi mūsu plašajos mežos, smilšainajā krastmalā, mazajās pilsētiņās- katrā no novadiem.
 

A road through the winter, 2010
Tādēļ es vēlētos veikt ceļojumu apkārt Latvijai un iemūžināt visus skaistos dabasskatus, vēsturiskās vietas, ko vien redzēšu ceļa laikā. Beigās apkopot to visu kalendārā un lielā fotogrāmatā.
Brauciens iekļauj visas labākās pilis, lielākās Latvijas pilsētas un arī interesantas vietas, kas ir apslēptas masu tūrismam. Šērsojot Kurzemi, Zemgali un Vidzemi, Latgali.
Fotografēt gribu visdažādākajos laikapstākļos, lai redzētu saullēktu un miglu, dienasgaismas spožumu, vakara zelta stundu un nakts mēnesgaismu.
 Vēlos vairumu no vietām apmeklēt šovasar, bet rudenī un ziemā to, ko nepaspēšu vai arī būs tā vērts gadalaika dēļ.
Kam vajadzīgi līdzekļi?

Automašīnas degvielai, sabiedriskajam transportam.
Ieejas biļētēm muzejos, nacionālajos parkos, visdažādākajās apskates vietās.
Lētai viesnīcai, kur pārlaist nakti, ja esmu kaut kur ļoti tālu.
Ja izdosies sasniegt mērķi:

Kā minēju mini aprakstā, man šobrīd ir parasta spoguļkamera Nikon D60, kuru lietoju jau kādus 4 gadus. Jau kādu laiku sapņoju par jaunu kameru, ir šis tas iekrāts, taču nepietiek. Arī naktīs nesanāk tik tīras bildes, kā vajadzētu, jo parādās troksnis. Jauna kamera noteikti palīdzētu arī turpmākai izaugsmei (taču man ir visai labas lēcas, statīvs utml. ).
Nopirktu arī ND filtrus, lai var padarīt krāsas labākas bez ""fotošopa"".
Kāpēc man tas ir svarīgi?
Šobrīd pavadu iespējams vienu no pēdējām sava mūža vasarām, kad nestrādāju. Vēlāk būs vienmēr vai nu mācības vai darbs un nebūs laika kam tādam. Vēlos radīt ko paliekošu priekš tiem, kas aizbraukuši no Latvijas darba meklējumos. Kā arī daudzi tūrsti ir labākajā gadījumā redzējuši tikai daļiņu Rīgas. Ar attēlu palīdzību varētu piesasitīt lielāku interesi par citām pilsētām un dabu aiz Latvijas centra.
Jūsu ieguldījums
Noteikti palīdzēsiet nest Latvijas vārdu pasaulē un parādīt iecienītos tūristu apskates objektus jaunā gaismā, kā arī, kas to lai zina, iespējams radīt jaunas tūrsma vietas! Arī palīdzēsiet man izveidot jaunu fotogrāmatu un kalendāru ar labākajām bildēm, kuras uzņemšu savās gaitās.
No tā, ko esmu redzējusi Latvijā, zinu, ka arī šajā valstī ir nenovērtētas vietas!
Kā vēl varat palīdzēt?

Dalieties ar indiegogo share podziņām par šo projektu, varbūt kāds no paziņām varēs kaut kā palīdzēt!
Varbūt jūsu apkaimē ir kāda jauka vieta, kura ir vērta iemūžināšanai?
Varbūt ir kāds labs padoms, kas man jāņem vērā?

Hello! 
I would like to ask for your help in my campaign. My name is Ilva and I am 19 years old. My main hobby has always been photography, though previously I have never had time to seriously do anything due to studies. I strated as nature photographer, but later evolved more into portraiture.

Dim woods, 2009
I live in a small Baltic country named Latvia(Lettland, Латвия). Though, country is small and we don't have epic landscapes like high mountains, gaisers, volcanoes and so on, we are special as beeing a one small nation, which could survive on this Earth even after we have been conquired and ruled by many nations such as Germans, Russians and Swedes. Everyone have left some memorable landmarks and shaped Latvia as it is now. Though, a lot of interesting sights have been destroyed by industrialising process and by both WW, when Latvia was one of the main battlefields. There is still a lot to see and tell, for example, secrets that lay in dense forests, totally walkable by foot sand coastline, famous art-noveau Old town in Riga etc.

Sunrays, 2009
I would like to make a photographic journey around my motherland and capture all the nature's beauty and historical sights that I can find.
My trip includes traveling around all mayor cities in Latvia, castles, national parks and interesting, hidden to mass tourism landscapes. Starting from Kurzeme to Zemgale, later Vidzeme and Latgale regions.
Will be shooting at all kind of times to see morning dawn and fog, daylight brightness, evening's golden hour and night's moonlight.
Road trip is going to start this summer and last until end of year with some breaks. To get the most out of each season.
 
For what I need the funds?

For car fuel, public transport tickets.
Entrance tickets to some national parks, castles and such places. 
Food, might take a long time until I get home.
Cheap accomodation, if going to stay overnight.
If I reach my goal then probably also equipment upgrade. At the moment I am using my Nikon D60 for some 4 years. But I have tripod and flashlight + nice lenses. I would like to upgrade my camera to full frame and buy ND filters for better scenery shots and also extra memory cards.

I have made some savings towards new camera, however it's not enough. I would definetly fancy a better one, because this one can't make high quality, low noise images at low light conditions, when usually you can get the best shots.


Poppy field, 2009
Why it is important to me?
This summer might be my last free one. Probably later I will have studies and work and then I will have no time for this kind of trips. Also want to leave something forever lasting for those who have left this country in order to find better payed work abroad. Probably you agree that most tourist who have been here at bast case have seen only a glipse of Riga. Some nice shots might inrigue them to check out what's happening outside the centre of Latvia.
Your involvement
Will definetly help me to promote Latvia and maybe even make new tourist destinations or make existing one's more popular. Also your contribution will greatly help to achieve one persons' dream and put together a book and a calendar.
 Because from what I have seen by living here, there must be more to tell in images about our land
How else you can help?
Firstly, if you can the please share this project using indiegogo buttons or sending links to anyone, who could contribute.
Secondly, maybe you can help with suggesting any interesting areas around your home?
Thirdly, maybe you want to be as a guide or provide a couch to sleep on?
If anything else is bothering you or have suggestions write down here!

<span style=""font-weight: normal; line-height: 26px;"">I struggled into my adult years to find </span><i style=""font-weight: normal; line-height: 26px;"">My Thing. </i><span style=""font-weight: normal; line-height: 26px;"">I fell in love with photography at the ripe old age of 21 and quickly learned that portrait photography was my happy place. It combines two of my favorite things, beautiful faces and beautiful lighting. A good portrait captures the subjects personality, it shows the best side of them and I became addicted to faces!  I do believe that a photo can steal your soul, or at least borrow it for a moment. A photo captures you in a light, in a mood, in a moment that will never exist in that exact equation again. </span>
</h3>
<h3><span style=""line-height: 26px;""><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Over the years, life has taken it's toll...

The photograph I have used for this campaign was the last major photo shoot I did, 2 summers ago. That's how long it's been!!! Ouch!  <br/>I am anxious to start creating again using beautiful and fascinating faces, to play with light and textures, to show the world the view through my eyes. You could help me make magic again! And what's life without a little magic?! <br/></span></span></h3>

I understand that any donation gets me closer to my dream set-up and aids in improving the quality of work that I can provide. I have done pretty well thus far with pretty basic equipment and I have prioritized my needs based on what will get me back into the swing of it in the most timely manner.

</div></div>","I just want to photograph the things I love and share those images with the world. It's pretty simple really...

I struggled into my adult years to find My Thing. I fell in love with photography at the ripe old age of 21 and quickly learned that portrait photography was my happy place. It combines two of my favorite things, beautiful faces and beautiful lighting. A good portrait captures the subjects personality, it shows the best side of them and I became addicted to faces!  I do believe that a photo can steal your soul, or at least borrow it for a moment. A photo captures you in a light, in a mood, in a moment that will never exist in that exact equation again. 

Over the years, life has taken it's toll... I've moved so many times in the past 3 years that my equipment is damaged and a bit of an embarrassment. :/ My cat did something to my computer screen which has screwed up the display and so any post-processing has to be done on my boyfriends PC (and I am a MAC user at heart, iLove Apple!). The photograph I have used for this campaign was the last major photo shoot I did, 2 summers ago. That's how long it's been!!! Ouch!  I am anxious to start creating again using beautiful and fascinating faces, to play with light and textures, to show the world the view through my eyes. You could help me make magic again! And what's life without a little magic?! 

I miss capturing beautiful faces like the sun misses the flower in the depths of winter. Instead of beauty to direct it's light to, my skill goes cold, like the frozen world photography's absence has banished me to... My Needs & Your Rewards

I have done my research and this is a comprehensive list of the equipment/upgrades I am looking into:


Camera upgrade: T1i $430 via B&H 


OR just a better lens: EF 50mm f/1.8 II - $125  or EF 50mm f/1.4 USM - $400


Macbook Pro: $2000 


OR MacBook repaired (battery life is shot, display screen is damaged) : Estimated $600 flat rate repairs via Apple 


Vinyl Backdrops: Infinity 9x10 in Black, White, and Gray, $100 each via B&H


Tripod: Magnum DX-4330M Deluxe Photo Tripod/Monopod via B&H - $40


RadioPopper Jrx receiver: $100 (I have 1 but need another so I can sync multiple lights at various distances).


Added to that a small % to cover the fees for this site and anything I may need to cover the cost of incentives and you'll see that my math isn't too bad either. =)
My hope is that the incentives will provide you with a small token of my gratitude, a piece of my work (a.k.a. my heart) to remind you of the good people can do when we support one another, and at the very least I hope it makes you SMILE. =D 
I have several projects in the works, some of which you could participate in depending on the incentive/reward you select! 


The Local Locks Project - Documenting individuals with dreadlocks in my area, aimed at shattering the negative stigma surrounding dreadlocks and showing the variety and beauty of locks. 


The Twins Project - A fascination I share with my favorite photographer, Joyce Tenneson. Two individuals, each a half of one whole. There's magic there...


The Redhead Project - I have a particular fascination with redheads and I am anxious to collect faces of all the beautiful, exotic redheads out there! 


The Dancer Project - Another passion of mine, dancing creates such powerful shapes and projects such emotion. I know so many beautiful, talented dancers that I would love to photograph and show the world! 


The Tattoo Project - An ongoing project that has spanned nearly 7 years now. Tattoos are beautiful and personal; unique to the individual whose skin they adorn. I would love the opportunity to fully commit to this project and allow people to tell their stories and proudly display their work. 

  Finding My Happy Place  It's not easy for me to ask for help, especially in financial matters. I am learning that my skill is a gift and the inability to use that skill to help others is really starting to wear on me. I have so many projects and collaborations in queue, you are helping bring these to life. Your donation not only benefits me, but those I'll have the honor of photographing, involving in my projects and helping along in their endeavors.I have had countless conversations with women that tell me how much being photographed gives them confidence. I love the opportunity to approach someone and help them see their own beauty. Most of the people I have photographed to date are friends who have indulged me and I would like to have a more professional set-up so that I can be confident in asking anyone to stand for me. 
  The reality of the struggle... I may not reach my goal. I understand that any donation gets me closer to my dream set-up and aids in improving the quality of work that I can provide. I have done pretty well thus far with pretty basic equipment and I have prioritized my needs based on what will get me back into the swing of it in the most timely manner. Any donation you make will be used with much gratitude and put towards the equipment needed for my most current project. You can be my hero!

<h3>Quest for the... Calendar?</h3>
<p>In October of this year, four men will be travelling across the Atlantic Ocean to start a trek that will take then 500 miles in four gruelling weeks of walking and camping using only Medieval gear - right down to costume, heavy canvas tents, and no lighter to start the campfire at night.</p>
<p>We are the Wayfarers, and this is our Quest for the Cure. We are doing this out of our own pocket in order to raise $100,000 for worldwide cancer research and support, and when we approached some of the fine ladies of Suicide Girls to help us out they jumped on board without hesitation.</p>
<p>In our Twelve Months of Magic calendar you'll see twelve of the top alternative models from around the world - from fan-favourite Suicide Girl Kemper to newcomers like Gallows and Artemis - taking their love of fantasy to new heights and helping us out by posing as pin-ups and having fun for a great cause.</p>
<p>Proceeds for the calendar - once funded - will be donated to the Association for International Cancer Research (or ""AICR""), a charity based on St Andrews, Scotland.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Money Thing</h3>
<p>With donated time and photography, we don't need that much money to get these calendars off the ground. The $2000 in donations will be broken down like so, with all numbers being fairly rough:</p>
<p>//$200 for fees from IndieGoGo and PayPal.<br/>//$650 for shipping costs for 100 calendars. This is to make absolutely sure we don't have to pay out of pocket for these calendars to find their way to your door! We will be sending calendars to Americans from New York State to save cross-border shipping costs.<br/>//$1250 for one thousand calendars to be printed, including taxes. It only takes five days, so once we're funded and all the photos are in from our (amazing!) models, your calendars will be en route - nice and simple.</p>
<p>Excess money will be donated directly to AICR - absolutely none of the money will be considered ""profit"" or ""play money."" None of this money will go to help fund our trip or any other fundraising endeavour; once the calendars and shipping have been paid for, every other cent goes to AICR.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We've run a number of fundraising campaigns for the Quest for the Cure in the last ten months, and have raised a decent chunk of our goal - almost $13,000 to three charities at the beginning of June. These calendars could raise over $10,000 <strong>by themselves</strong> if they are successfully sold out.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Can't afford to buy a calendar? Don't want this particular piece of art hanging in your office, but still want to help out? There are lots of ways for you to do that:</p>

In our Twelve Months of Magic calendar you'll see twelve of the top alternative models from around the world - from fan-favourite Suicide Girl Kemper to newcomers like Gallows and Artemis - taking their love of fantasy to new heights and helping us out by posing as pin-ups and having fun for a great cause.
Proceeds for the calendar - once funded - will be donated to the Association for International Cancer Research (or ""AICR""), a charity based on St Andrews, Scotland.


The Money Thing
With donated time and photography, we don't need that much money to get these calendars off the ground. The $2000 in donations will be broken down like so, with all numbers being fairly rough:
//$200 for fees from IndieGoGo and PayPal.//$650 for shipping costs for 100 calendars. This is to make absolutely sure we don't have to pay out of pocket for these calendars to find their way to your door! We will be sending calendars to Americans from New York State to save cross-border shipping costs.//$1250 for one thousand calendars to be printed, including taxes. It only takes five days, so once we're funded and all the photos are in from our (amazing!) models, your calendars will be en route - nice and simple.
Excess money will be donated directly to AICR - absolutely none of the money will be considered ""profit"" or ""play money."" None of this money will go to help fund our trip or any other fundraising endeavour; once the calendars and shipping have been paid for, every other cent goes to AICR.


The Impact
We've run a number of fundraising campaigns for the Quest for the Cure in the last ten months, and have raised a decent chunk of our goal - almost $13,000 to three charities at the beginning of June. These calendars could raise over $10,000 by themselves if they are successfully sold out.


Other Ways You Can Help
Can't afford to buy a calendar? Don't want this particular piece of art hanging in your office, but still want to help out? There are lots of ways for you to do that:

Of course, please consider donating whatever you can directly to the charities in question through our donations page. Every dollar counts.

<br/>Introduction<p>My name is Richard Webb. I'm a native of Arizona.  I have a degree in Commercial Photography from Northern Arizona University and have been a freelance contributor and contract photographer for Arizona Highways magazine for many years.</p>
<p>I've learned that strong compositions, beautiful lighting, and dramatic skies make the best landscape images. The same elements also make for amazing Temple images. Creating powerful and inspiring images of LDS Temples has become a passion of mine.</p>
<p>Selling prints through Deseret Book and other LDS retail outlets has given me the chance to build an audience, connect with fans, and gain valuable feedback. <br/></p>
<p>Over the years I received hundreds of requests for a calendar with my images. Last year I initiated a fundraiser just like this one and produced a 2016 calendar of Arizona's five LDS Temples.</p>
<p>The response was overwhelmingly positive and I received many more requests to continue producing calendars.<br/></p>
<p><b><u>Objective</u></b></p>
<p>My goal now is to again produce a 14-month calendar featuring the five LDS Temples in Arizona. The calendar will actually have 16 Temple images, including the cover and an image on the year-at-a-glance page. It will make a great Christmas gift.</p>
<p>The purpose of this campaign is to fund the production and distribution of the calendar.  By backing this project you can receive one or more copies of the calendar for yourself, or to give as gifts. <br/></p>
<p>Each page of the calendar will be 8 1/2"" x 11"", but the actual Temple images will be 8"" x 10"" in size. Past month's images can be removed from the calendar and put it in a frame, if you choose. This can be an economical way to display Temple images throughout your home. <br/></p>
<p>Capturing the images and producing a quality calendar is expensive. There are significant upfront costs for equipment, travel, and the setup and actual printing. I've put in a lot of effort, this last year especially, to create amazing images for the calendar.   <br/></p>

<h2 style=""margin-top:50px;"">What’s wrong with existing hand straps?</h2>
<p>No one’s really ever loved their hand strap… that is, until now. Other hand straps are flimsy and hard to get your hand in and out of, they’re not comfortable for long periods of time, and they don’t truly support your hand. They also occupy your camera's tripod slot and need to be removed when using a tripod. The SpiderLight Hand Strap solves all those problems with its revolutionary design and ergonomics.</p>
<h2 style=""margin-top:50px;"">What's special about this hand strap?</h2>
<p>Our new SpiderLight Hand Strap is specifically designed for smaller camera bodies like Fuji X-T1, SONY a7’s/7II’s, Olympus OMD to name a few. As good as they are, these cameras DO NOT have enough grip for your hand to hold comfortably for more than a few minutes - until now!</p>

<h2 style=""margin-top:50px;"">How does it attach to my camera?</h2>
<p>There are a few easy ways to attach our hand strap to your camera: use your tripod's quick-release plate (we're compatible with all brands), or use a Spider Plate (the thin profile at the end of the hand strap fits right between your plate and your camera body), or simply use the hardware included with our hand strap.</p>

<p>The outside is crafted from a proprietary nylon-based material that is extremely strong and flexible, allowing it to “remember” the shape of your hand.

We are particularly proud of the design innovation that went into our new light hand strap. Like our other products, and true to the Spider ethos, the SpiderLight Hand Strap is an intelligent solution to a common problem faced by everyday photographers.





Frequently Asked Questions
Will this strap work with the smaller Olympus OMD cameras?
It will work with your OMD by using the smart adapters that come with the strap.
What about the Fuji XT-1 and other mirrorless cameras where the shutter trigger is on top of the camera body?
No problem, our smart adapters ensure your hand is always in the proper shooting position for all flagship mirrorless and small DSLR cameras. See the photo below.

What is the projected production schedule/timeline once the campaign has been completed?
We will be shipping August 2016!
Will the hand strap work with a Nikon D7100 DSLR?
Your camera would probably fair better with the SpiderPro Hand Strap (http://spiderholster.com/handstrap).
I own a Canon 5D and use it with 24-105 f/4 regularly. I also own a Nikon 7200 and use it regularly with Nikon's 18-300 lens. Is this new SpiderLight hand strap intended for cameras of this size, or are they too big/heavy?
The SpiderLight Hand Strap was designed primarily for smaller mirrorless cameras. Larger cameras with heavier lenses should use our http://spiderholster.com/handstrap.
Does this new hand strap work with the battery grip on a Sony A7RII?
Yes, absolutely!
Will the rain cover be sold separately? If so, about what price? What about the other new items?
When our campaign ends, we'll be selling all individual products through our website, http://spiderholster.com. The rain cover will retail there for $25.
As the NEX-7 is now an older camera, will you have adapters for it?
Our smart adapters will work with the NEX 7.
Can the spider web be used by itself or does it have to be used in conjunction with the holster?
It can be used by itself, although it is not designed to be a carrying strap. It is a safety strap meant for added security and peace of mind.
Will this strap work with a Nikon D3300, or would the Spider Pro be more suited to that?
The Nikon D3300 is a good fit for the SpiderLight Hand Strap.
Risks and Challenges
The SpiderLight Hand Strap has been designed, tested, refined, and is now ready for production. We are confident that your support will allow us to get our new hand strap into production and into your hands this Summer.",26.0,1,"1 Campaign

Jen was my best friend and I knew the minute I first saw her that she was the one. The following February, only five months after our wedding, Jennifer was diagnosed with breast cancer. In December of 2011, Jen passed. </p>
<p class=""p1"">At times during Jen's treatment we realized that our family and friends did not understand how serious our life had become, and really, how could they?</p>
<p class=""p1"">Thankfully, Jennifer let me photograph our day to day life so we could let them in on it. </p>
<p class=""p1"">The money raised through this campaign will allow me to share these photos with the world and produce a book that will accompany a traveling exhibition. The photographs, centering around Jennifer and her battle with breast cancer, tell a story of love, grace and courage in the face of a horrible disease. </p>
<p class=""p1"">My goal is to bring awareness to the realities of a daily life with cancer and the importance of being there for someone who is fighting for his or her life. </p>
<p class=""p1"">Since I will be publishing this book (hard copy and ebook) on my own it will be my responsibility to oversee all aspects of its production. In order to achieve the level of quality I desire I will assemble a team consisting of a photo editor, a designer, a PR/Marketing consultant and myself. Together we will work to produce a book and exhibition that will not only inform but also inspire.</p>
<p class=""p1"">My photographs are not just about cancer; they are about love and life, and never giving up. They are about embracing every second.</p>

The following February, only five months after our wedding, Jennifer was diagnosed with breast cancer. In December of 2011, Jen passed. 
At times during Jen's treatment we realized that our family and friends did not understand how serious our life had become, and really, how could they?
Thankfully, Jennifer let me photograph our day to day life so we could let them in on it. 
The money raised through this campaign will allow me to share these photos with the world and produce a book that will accompany a traveling exhibition. The photographs, centering around Jennifer and her battle with breast cancer, tell a story of love, grace and courage in the face of a horrible disease. 
My goal is to bring awareness to the realities of a daily life with cancer and the importance of being there for someone who is fighting for his or her life. 
Since I will be publishing this book (hard copy and ebook) on my own it will be my responsibility to oversee all aspects of its production. In order to achieve the level of quality I desire I will assemble a team consisting of a photo editor, a designer, a PR/Marketing consultant and myself. Together we will work to produce a book and exhibition that will not only inform but also inspire.
My photographs are not just about cancer; they are about love and life, and never giving up. They are about embracing every second.

professional photographer.</p><p>If I try to remember when I fell in love with photography
I suppose that the answer can be only when daddy used to shout me back because I

with an analogical camera than with a mirrorless and finally thanks to a real

small books to patient friends, than someone noticed my photos and asked me for
some shots,  I was the proudest on earth,
I was doing it, and all by myself! The step after has been made by some local
clubs that asked me to take photos at their main events. And that’s when I
started thinking that my dream could really come true. And the first
photographic project was taking his shapes, a photographic book about forgotten
and abandoned buildings, at first on the Maltese islands, than in the southern Europe,
and perhaps who knows even more!</p>
<p>The hard part now is to buy new equipment, such as lights, bunkers,
umbrellas AND a new camera.</p>
<p>I settled the fund raising campaign at 5000€ thinking of the new camera, a
Canon 5D mk3, two umbrellas, two soft box, and of course the printing fees for
the first copies of the book. </p>
<p>The idea is to start this new adventure, and of course YOUR help will be
essential, I'm working hard to realize my project and I really think that
whatever will happen, even if it will take more time, my dream will be
realized, but of course with your help you will have at least a new book in
your library.</p>
<p>I've always thought that the art of photography wasn't only made by  a “perfect click”, that can be done almost from
everyone with modern technologies, but was having the capability of
transmitting something to whoever looks at your work, and as a part of my
project you will become my first audience, and the first people that I’d love
to be impressed.</p>

<p>Federico<br/><br/>Ragazzo di 27 anni che passa tutto il suo tempo libero studiando, migliorando e scattando foto per far diventare un sogno realtà: diventare un fotografo professionista.<br/>Credo che questa frase mi dipinga perfettamente, se provo a ricordare il momento in cui scoccò la scintilla fra me e il mondo della fotografia, probabilmente la risposta la troverei pensando alle sgridate di mio papà quando andavo a toccacciare la sua Nikon, era un oggetto proibito e quindi di per se interessante e poi poteva fermare il mondo con un ""click"". Da quel momento giorno dopo giorno ho inseguito una passione prima con delle macchine analogiche, poi con una compatta digitale e finalmente grazie ad un caro amico ho avuto fra le mani la prima reflex digitale, il mio sogno prendeva lentamente forma.                            Ho iniziato a fare foto agli amici che, con infinita pazienza, mi hanno sempre sopportato e supportato fino a quando un giorno qualcuno ha iniziato a notare le mie foto e mi ha chiesto di fare degli scatti insieme. Il passo dopo è arrivato da solo, alcuni locali della zona mi hanno contattato per andare a fare foto nei loro eventi principali, e il mio sogno sembrava ogni giorno più a portata di mano, e più si avvicinava e è più il mio primo progetto fotografico vero prendeva forma: un libro fotografico sugli edifici storici abbandonati e ricchi di mistero, all'inizio sull'isola di Malta, poi in sud europa e poi chissà.La parte più difficile arriva ora, riuscire a far partire il progetto, acquistare le attrezzature di cui ho bisogno e iniziare a lavorare sodo.L'idea è di iniziare questa nuova avventura in ogni caso sia che la capagna vada a buon fine sia che invece non riesca ad arrivare alla somma pensata, e naturalmente il vostro aiuto sarà essenziale, sto lavorando sodo per realizzare il mio progetto e credo davvero che qualunque cosa accadrà, anche se ci vorrà più tempo, il mio sogno verrà realizzato, ma, naturalmente, con il vostro aiuto sarà tutto molto più semplice.Ho sempre pensato che l'arte della fotografia non sia solo arrivare a fare un ""perfetto click"", che può essere fatto quasi da tutti con le moderne tecnologie, ma che sia avere la capacità di trasmettere qualcosa a chi guarda il tuo lavoro, e come parte attiva del mio progetto diventerete il mio primo pubblico, e le prime persone che mi piacerebbe colpire.<br/></p></div>","Short Summary

<p>In January 2013, I will be joining International Teams Uganda for a media missions trip. </p>
<p>International Teams Uganda works, “with a vision to see lives and communities transformed by the power of God.  Their mission is to walk alongside the local church to reach out to the oppressed in specific roped-off communities in the Teso region and beyond; more specifically, it is to energize, equip and engage local Christians passionate about specific areas of ministry to grow deep roots in the Biblical worldview – centering on Jesus, the full expression of the Father’s love and value of human life – and, as a result, to bring hope, dignity and wholeness to the poor, slave and blind within their communities.” –Tim Sliedrecht, Team Leader, Uganda.</p>
<p>Uganda has faced drastic hardship and suffering for the past 40 years.  Through the power of God, change and transformation is happening.  I believe that each of us have been given gifts to greatly impact the world around us.  Over three weeks, through my gifts of photography and videography, I will be working alongside the local churches in Soroti, Obulle, Pampa, and Achelle. Capturing stories of hope and transformation, will help to educate, inspire, influence, liberate, edify, and encourage.</p>

<p>International Teams Uganda is fighting for the oppressed and the least of these.  Through the local church, they are seeing that everyone receives food, freedom, and forgiveness. <strong> No one is invisible.  </strong>Tangibly, this looks like loving former child soldiers and helping them process their pasts and grab hold of their futures.  This also looks like visiting the widow’s home and helping a whole village benefit from clean water.  Farms are reaping crops and street children are being cared for. </p>
<p>While in Uganda, I will be specifically working with Andrew Nicdoem, and Ryan Gilles (<a href=""namingtheworld.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">namingtheworld.org</a>).  Together, we will capture the stories of beneficiaries and share how transformation has come through the love of God.  We intend to create media that will bring awareness to local communities on specific issues.  We also have an opportunity to do a photography club and educate on photo ethics and skills.</p>

<p>My name is Mark Wyatt. I've been photographing interesting and unfamous people on city streets since around 1980 (examples below). Over those 35 years my photographs have almost without exception never ventured outside my home - I have been my own audience and only critic, tacking new images to the walls of my workroom until it gets too crowded and then retiring a few to a file box to make room for the next.<br/></p>
<p></p>
<p>For quite a while now however, I've had to listen to a nagging voice telling me that I haven't done enough, not nearly enough. And it's right. I've photographed as much as my job has left time for, but it's been sporadic and I know that I haven't done as much or as well as I should.</p>
<p>Since none of the photos have ever been exhibited or published or sold, I don't know if there's a place for them anywhere other than where they live today.  If not, I'll just keep doing what I've been doing.  But if the work can finance itself, then I can do more, do better, and hopefully create a significant body of work.</p>
<p>So I'm here at indiegogo because despite the need for funding, I want very much for the work itself to remain the primary goal if not the exclusive one as it has been for the past 35 years - and here is one place where an ambition can be financed with modest donations from strangers who have no agenda or connection to the goal other than that they see it as worthwhile.</p>
<p>If the examples below have piqued your curiosity, please go to <a href=""https://mwwyatt.wordpress.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">mwwyatt.wordpress.com</a> to view more, and if you find what you see there to be worthy, come back and make a $20 donation.  In thanks for your donation, I'll send you four 4x6 prints, signed and numbered.</p>
<p>Every image you see and every print you'll receive in the mail is uncropped and minimally processed - it is what the camera saw, the full frame printed archivally and adjusted only to get as close as possible to what I saw and was hoping to capture. The images are simple and pure - from my eye to the camera to the print to you with as little manipulation as possible along the way.</p>
<p>The proposal is equally simple. There is essentially one donation level - 20 dollars; and the only thank-you gift is the set of four prints. Every week or two (or three), I'll run a new campaign for 15 days with a new set of 4 thank-you prints.  And I'll keep doing that hopefully for a very long time. You can collect a new set each round or jump in and out as you please. My promise is to create more and deliver the results to you in a future round.  And together we'll watch and grow and see where this all goes.</p>
<p>There are also a few multiple-donation levels so that you can donate today for future rounds, if you want to make sure not to miss one. Donors to future rounds will be sent their thank-you gifts as each successive round ends.</p>
<p>These images do not intend to make a statement.  They are observations, simple snapshots of everyday people being everyday people.  There is no message hiding in a theme or revelation to be found by analyzing the context.  The subject is the phenomenon called the human condition, unburdened by any attempt to explain it. Each image is meant to feel familiar, even if you're looking at it for the first time, because an emotion captured in a stranger's expression is where we and the code that runs our family of man intersect.  To make that connection is the reason for these photographs. I hope that as you look them over, you'll see what I mean.<br/></p>
<p>Enjoy. And thank you.</p>

MUD Africa
(Mobilizing + Uniting Development in Africa) is an NGO working to better the
lives of Malawians as advocates of land and housing rights. (www.mudafrica.org)
Malawi is one of the most rapidly urbanizing countries in the world at a rate of
6.3 percent per year. That is three times the global rate and nearly twice that
of the African rate. Unfortunately, the economy lacks proportional growth
measures necessary to address and reduce poverty levels, and epidemic becoming
more visible in the increasing manifestation of informal settlements (slums).
Mutually reinforcing conditions of these settlements include poor
infrastructure, water and sanitation, substandard housing with insecure tenure
and a lack of basic social services.
 
MUD Africa is an
advocate for 'the Right to Adequate Housing' as recognized under the
International Bill of Human Rights, using seven defining factors of 'adequacy'
identified by the Committee of Economic, Social and Cultural Rights under the
International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR). Malawi
is one of the 171 nations to adopt the Habitat Agenda II in 1996, making them
responsible for ensuring this human right is upheld. Despite a general
consensus by all nations of failure to induce social development through aid,
MUD Africa is aware that international agencies have been successful in

creation of grassroots movements has worked to raise considerable awareness of
housing and land rights throughout poor communities. MUD Africa uses a
bottom-up approach to slum redevelopment and upgrading, stressing the
importance of community-based organization and involvement in shelter projects. 
 
As part of MUD
Africa's engagement in shelter, we are first developing a three-month
documentary series, which will begin in mid-April 2012 and conclude in
mid-July 2012. Information on the ground will be collected and compiled;
using photography, video, interviews and personal accounts which support a
social mapping exercise; the theme being 'the Right to Adequate Housing'.
The project is intended to stimulate global awareness while securing local
plans of action. The seven defining components of 'adequate' stated by the
Committee of Economic, Social and Cultural Rights include: legal security of
tenure, availability of services, material, facilities and infrastructure,
affordability, habitability, accessibility, location, and cultural adequacy. The
photo/video documentary series will be done with a specific focus on all/most
of the seven components of 'adequate' which highlights specific cases, all
the while an in-depth investigation will be done to record and further analyse
a broader spectrum of related information through questionnaires, debates/conferences,
etc. within various communities.
THE IMPACT
Nearly every nation worldwide
recognizes the basic human right to adequate housing. No citizen, regardless of
age, economic status, gender, ethnicity or other criteria, should question his
or her government's concern for his or her need for adequate housing. Article 2
of the United Nations Right to Adequate Housing Convention prohibits
discrimination by governments against individuals involving their right to
adequate housing.
The level of housing that constitutes adequate housing can be subjective. The
term adequacy is defined and perceived very differently depending on social
groups and cultures. Formal housing is almost exclusively a middle-class
concern as it has been found low-income households give higher priority to
other needs, once adequate basic shelter is obtained and basic services are
provided, than to improve their housing conditions. This does not imply the
low-income population does not want formal housing; rather, planners and
developers should not presume the main concerns of different social groups and
dismiss their priorities of allocating scarce resources. This is often
unexplored and misunderstood in interventions proposed by the international
community. To create a measure of adequacy in various contexts, MUD Africa will work to
establish a monitoring system that takes into account affordable health,
environmental and building standards appropriate and applicable to local
conditions. Information collected through on-going monitoring will help to
assist international developers, such as architects, urban planners and so
forth to establish the first-stages of housing and ensure project needs are
met. 
The project builds on a bottom-up, participatory model for later project
development. This approach ensures the data collected and proposals optimized
are as culturally sensitive and realistic as possible, furthering
inclusiveness, empowerment and lasting commitment. 
The
documentary project will be made into a published book to share the findings
and continue to raise funding for the next stages of the project, with an
additional exhibition of the photos and recorded, edited video footage.
Photography is not only documented 'evidence' but a tool to communicate across
a host of barriers. Smaller photography editorials will be published on the MUD
Africa website monthly along with a written 'diary' of the findings.  

The following areas will be addressed after this three-month documentary
project:
1. Revision of housing policy to make it more inclusive of low-income
households and disadvantaged individuals
2. Revision of housing policy to recognize new/alternative building technology
and sustainable materials, enabling new mortgage options.
3. The sustainable, physical upgrade of existing low-income housing to address
issues also related to health and livelihoods.
4. Community housing rights and educational outreach programmes
WHAT WE NEED
We are looking for 6,000 USD for this initial three
month project. This will go towards the upgrade of equipment and software,
transportation, exhibition costs such as printing and framing, campaign
materials, renting a space to hold community meetings, communication
(phone/internet), a translator, and related activities/ every day costs over the

It began with my archiving older photographic images, filing them and generally organizing all the images I have taken over the past 20 years. As I was reviewing all of these photographs, it occurred to me that some of the images that I had previously decided not to use, either due to accidental camera shake or double exposure, had very strong compositional value to them. Coincidentally, at the same time that I was going through my old photographs, I had been researching historical <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albumen_print"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Albumen printing process</a> for possible use in printing my still life images. The still life photographs all include antique tin type portraits, and researching alternative and longstanding methods of printing seemed fitting.  Then an idea came to me.</p>

<p>I started by creating a digital negative a la’ Dan Burkholder, with whom I had the pleasure of working back in 1996. After creating the negative and outputting via Lightjet onto clear film, I sent the new experiment to a NYC lab that I knew still did alternative processes. </p>
<p>I was very impressed with the result! In June of 2012 I finished my selection process, choosing the previously discarded images that now shine in this new series.

Southampton Solent University </b><br/>
<br/>The class of 2015 BA(HONS)
Photography students at Southampton Solent University, are holding two Degree
Shows. One located in Southampton, and the other at the London PrintSpace. As a group of intuitive and enthusiastic photographers, we are
gathering the funds to hold our exhibition ‘Coda’ to the
highest of standards to best portray ourselves as aspiring artists within the
field of photography. <br/><br/><b>ONGOING PROJECTS</b>   <br/> <br/>There are 42 students
taking part in the Southampton exhibition and 29 at the London Print Space. Projects are ongoing to raise our funds, such as a
student led magazine called PentaPrism. The magazine was started by the class
of 2014, and this year we are continuing their work . The submissions are open
to the first, second and third year Photography (BA) HONS students at the University. Other small projects have been conducted, such as offering a service for passport styled pictures for students and the general public.<br/>
<br/><b>HOW YOU CAN HELP</b><br/><br/>We have a large range of costs that need covering, from our end of year 
Catalogue, to renting the London PrintSpace and paying for printing costs. With our personal projects for fundraising, we are able to collect small funds to put towards our shows. However we can’t do
it without some added support to accumulate the money we need to make our exhibitions the best they possibly could
be! <br/><br/>We need to raise £750 to have the backing we need to make this
project lift off the ground and achieve a first rate showcase that all can be
proud of. As afore mentioned, the money raised will be put towards important aspects such as hiring the London PrintSpace and being able to produce a high end catalogue, and being able to help each individual present  work to their desired outcomes! It involves a lot of time and dedication but as
the class of 2015 we are determined to present ourselves in the field of
photography as enthusiastic artists always wishing to show the best of what we
can achieve!<br/><br/>If you can't donate, dont feel like you cant help because you can! A simple share of this page with family and friends is one of the simplest ways to get the word to others! <br/>
<br/><b>WHAT YOU WILL RECIEVE</b> <br/><br/>
We want all of our contributors to feel apart of the final outcome, so first and foremost we invite you to our show 'Coda' so you can see what you have aided and what we have been spending three years working towards.

<h4>The campaign is over but you can still contribute for the continuation of The Atlas of Beauty . Your support is really important because it will help me reach more places of the earth and show more diversity of our amazing planet. Our world really needs an Atlas of Beauty and we can create it together. </h4><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1296841/files/20150315124806-343.jpg?1426448886"" src="""" style=""""/><div><b style=""font-size: 30px;letter-spacing: 1px;line-height: 38px;background-color: initial;""><br/></b></div><div>
<b style=""font-size: 30px;letter-spacing: 1px;line-height: 38px;background-color: initial;"">What is The Atlas of Beauty</b><br/>
</div>
<p>First of all, let me introduce myself: I’m Mihaela Noroc, a 29 years old photographer from Romania. In
the past 2 years I traveled around the world, with my own small savings,
photographing hundreds of women and creating a project called The Atlas of
Beauty. </p>
<p>My goal is to show that
beauty is everywhere and is not about race, money or trends, but more about
being yourself, natural and authentic.</p>
<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1296720/files/20150315120449-1.Maramures_Romania.jpg?1426446289"" src="""" style=""""/><p><i>     #1 Romania</i></p><p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">
</span></p><p>Today more and more women feel a
pressure to look in a certain way, but I think we are beautiful, if we treasure
what makes us unique. </p>
<p>The Atlas of Beauty
became viral on the internet and major publications, from all around the world,
wrote about it. Now I have the chance to make my statement heard so it's very
important to continue my project.<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;background-color: initial;"">  </span><i style=""font-style: italic;letter-spacing: 0px;font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;background-color: initial;"">    </i></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1296725/files/20150315120503-2.Omo_Valley__Etiopia.jpg?1426446303"" src="""" style=""width: 302.410169491525px;height: 454px;""/>   <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1296727/files/20150315120523-2b.jpg?1426446323"" src="""" style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;width: 303.333333333333px;height: 455px;background-color: initial;""/></p>   <i>#</i><i>2 Ethiopia                                                                 #3 Colombia</i><div>

<p>I have to travel at
least one year to gather enough images for publishing a comprehensive Atlas, but
I really need your support to do this journey. </p>
<p>I plan to visit all continents, except Atarctica, and I will make my exact route based on your votes. I will go in both modern and traditional countries. I will cover different kind of environments from cities, villages and remote areas to show the diversity of our planet, through portraits of women. </p>
<p>Now millions of people
will see my photos and together we can send a powerful message to the world. We
can show that beauty is in our differences and we should all be proud of
ourselves. </p>

<h2><b>Costs for continuing The Atlas of Beauty</b></h2>
<p>A photographic journey
around the world is not cheap, but I’m used to get along with what I have,
because I love what I do. </p>
<p>To make the project
properly for one year I will need at least 27,000 USD. My expenses are explained below:</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1296922/files/20150315132521-GraficIndie.jpg?1426451121"" src="""" style=""width: 472.954423592493px;height: 366px;""/></p>
<p>I will need around 20
plane tickets, some of them on long distances. Beside this, I will need ground
transportation, accommodation and food. My budget also have to cover
insurances, visa fees, and, of course, unexpected expenses. </p>
<p>When I will take photos
in communities in need, I will try to help as much as I can, offering gifts and sharing
the story with people that can support.  </p>
<p>I will have to update
my photo gear buying a new lens and 2 resistant external hard drives. I will
also need some accessories to add to my DSLR, for filming my journey. </p>
<p>A part of my budget has
to cover the productions of the perks + Indiegogo fee and bank charges. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1296739/files/20150315120926-2d.jpg?1426446566"" src="""" style=""""/></p>        <i>#5 Cuba</i><p><i></i></p>
<p><b>Now that I reached the funding goal, I can cover the expenses listed above. </b></p>
<p><b>But more funds I raise, more countries and diversity I will capture. The extra funds are essential for the quality of the project so each contribution is still very important. </b></p>
<p>With your support, I will explore more areas of the world. <span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">  </span></p>
<p>I will also be able to
offer more support when visiting communities in need.</p>
<p>Sometime I will be able to rent a car or hire a guide to go in more remote places.</p>

<p>But this is just the beginning. If I will have your support I will capture much more diversity. Together we will continue to show that beauty means to be yourself, to be proud of your roots, to cultivate what you have, instead of being disappointed about something that you don’t have.</p>
<p>Beauty is in our differences and uniqueness. Now I’m saying it trough words, but if I will have your support, I will “say” it better through my photos.</p>

</div></div>","The campaign is over but you can still contribute for the continuation of The Atlas of Beauty . Your support is really important because it will help me reach more places of the earth and show more diversity of our amazing planet. Our world really needs an Atlas of Beauty and we can create it together. 
What is The Atlas of Beauty

First of all, let me introduce myself: I’m Mihaela Noroc, a 29 years old photographer from Romania. In
the past 2 years I traveled around the world, with my own small savings,
photographing hundreds of women and creating a project called The Atlas of
Beauty. 
My goal is to show that
beauty is everywhere and is not about race, money or trends, but more about
being yourself, natural and authentic.
     #1 Romania
Today more and more women feel a
pressure to look in a certain way, but I think we are beautiful, if we treasure
what makes us unique. 
The Atlas of Beauty
became viral on the internet and major publications, from all around the world,
wrote about it. Now I have the chance to make my statement heard so it's very
important to continue my project.            #2 Ethiopia                                                                 #3 Colombia

I have to travel at
least one year to gather enough images for publishing a comprehensive Atlas, but
I really need your support to do this journey. 
I plan to visit all continents, except Atarctica, and I will make my exact route based on your votes. I will go in both modern and traditional countries. I will cover different kind of environments from cities, villages and remote areas to show the diversity of our planet, through portraits of women. 
Now millions of people
will see my photos and together we can send a powerful message to the world. We
can show that beauty is in our differences and we should all be proud of
ourselves. 


     #4 Ecuador
Costs for continuing The Atlas of Beauty
A photographic journey
around the world is not cheap, but I’m used to get along with what I have,
because I love what I do. 
To make the project
properly for one year I will need at least 27,000 USD. My expenses are explained below:




I will need around 20
plane tickets, some of them on long distances. Beside this, I will need ground
transportation, accommodation and food. My budget also have to cover
insurances, visa fees, and, of course, unexpected expenses. 
When I will take photos
in communities in need, I will try to help as much as I can, offering gifts and sharing
the story with people that can support.  
I will have to update
my photo gear buying a new lens and 2 resistant external hard drives. I will
also need some accessories to add to my DSLR, for filming my journey. 
A part of my budget has
to cover the productions of the perks + Indiegogo fee and bank charges. 
        #5 Cuba
Now that I reached the funding goal, I can cover the expenses listed above. 
But more funds I raise, more countries and diversity I will capture. The extra funds are essential for the quality of the project so each contribution is still very important. 
With your support, I will explore more areas of the world.   
I will also be able to
offer more support when visiting communities in need.
Sometime I will be able to rent a car or hire a guide to go in more remote places.

     #7 Romania                                                               #8 Colombia


Rewards
for your contribution
For 30 USD you will receive The Atlas of Beauty E-book by e-mail, in a few days. It contains 105 pages of photos and short stories
from my first journey. 
For 60 USD  you will
receive the The Atlas of Beauty E-book, in a few days, and a Postcard, sent by me to your mail-box, sometime during
my journey. 
For
100 USD you
will receive the E-book, the
Postcard and you will become a member of The Atlas of Beauty Community.
As a member of the community you will always be a close friend of the project
and your name will be written on The First Edition of The Atlas of Beauty (the
hardcover book that will be published in 2016, after my journey)
        #9 Amazon Rainforest


            #10  Peru          #11 USA


The Impact of the project
The Atlas of Beauty has been featured in major publications of the world. This coverage offers us the opportunity to send our message to more people.

But this is just the beginning. If I will have your support I will capture much more diversity. Together we will continue to show that beauty means to be yourself, to be proud of your roots, to cultivate what you have, instead of being disappointed about something that you don’t have.
Beauty is in our differences and uniqueness. Now I’m saying it trough words, but if I will have your support, I will “say” it better through my photos.

<h3>About the Photographic Museum of Humanity</h3>
<p>Photographic Museum of Humanity is an artistic start-up founded in between Bologna and Buenos Aires in august 2011.</p>
<p><strong>The project aims to create and develop the first online museum dedicated to photography</strong>, made with the most interesting works submitted to our web platform by the professional photographers of our artistic community. </p>
<p>The first Museum actually accessible to everyone from every corner of the world, at any time, for free. <strong>A place where people will have the possibility to learn</strong> about photography and its universal language.</p>

<h3>Why Funding our project</h3>
<p><strong>Our idea is to promote and bring to everyone the power of art</strong>. A language that is universal and promote integration and multiculturalism.

</b></p>
<p>Thank you for taking the time to consider supporting my solo
exhibit at The Center in Long Beach in May &amp; June 2014. This is a very
exciting time for me and an opportunity to re-launch my photography career. But
I am coming up short.  $3,000 to be
exact.  So I am coming to you, my
friends and admirers of my photography, to help bring my exhibit to life. The
$3,000 is the remaining amount required to professionally print my selected 30
images onto beautiful, large canvases for the exhibit.  I know nothing in life comes for free
and I have never been one to expect or ask for handouts in my life. In return
for your loving support, I am offering some very cool perks. Please take a moment
to have a look. </p><p></p><p>
</p><p>This exhibit will be a very inspirational showing. I was
born with Cerebral Palsy, a condition in which doctors believed and said I
would never live a productive life. 
I set out to prove them wrong and took up photography as my outlet for
expression at the age of 10 years old and have never looked back.  Unfortunately, I, like many artists,
have been impacted by the economy. This will be the first show I have done in
15 years!</p>
<p>Through your support, we will be able to provide a source of
hope and inspiration. I am not just showing my photographs, but aiming to use
my art to give inspiration to people with any disabilities or any of life’s
barriers, and show that people can triumph.  </p>
<p>This exhibit will give my work the opportunity to be experienced
by 100’s of people by the LGBTQ community and anyone else who wishes to be
inspired.  My exhibit will include
a “meet and greet” reception at The Center on Saturday, May 24, 2014 from 5pm
to 9pm, where I would love to connect with all of you, face to face, surrounded
by the true story of my life; my art. The Center is at 2017 E. Fourth St in
Long Beach, CA 90814.</p>
<p>Personally, this exhibit is a testimony of my strength, my
love for photography and the people that I meet because of it, and for the
belief in myself where I did not give up on a dream that was forming for most
of my life. So, I am asking all of you to please make any donation you see fit
to turn my dream into a reality.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Love,</span></p>

Portrait of Mark Studner - graphite pencil drawing by David J. Vanderpool Copyright 2014 <br/></u></b></p><p><b><u>About My Life and
Photography-</u></b></p>
<p>My photography has spanned 35+ years since I first picked up
a camera. I went to a handicap school until 6th grade where I found my talent
with photography. Just for me picking up a camera at that age was an amazing
achievement because I was born with Cerebral Palsy (CP) which affected my
speech and my motor skill of walking and holding. But still, I had a minor form
of CP. My mom encouraged me to follow my dreams and as soon as people in the
community noticed my talent I was on my way to success despite of my
disability.</p>
<p> I was the yearbook
photographer for all Junior High &amp; High School and received an AA degree in
photo-journalism in college. I soon found myself at KROQ as a personal
photographer for the radio station taking photographs of bands such as Duran
Duran, R.E.M., Billy Idol and others. I also worked out of my home photo studio
and a dark room. I soon had many exhibits around Los Angeles in such places as
Rage and Figs West Hollywood, and Van Go’s Ear in Venice Beach. Due to their popularity,
numerous Los Angeles based magazines found me and put my work on their covers
including Edge, Frontiers, Fab and many others. I have worked with model and
talent agencies giving me the opportunity to photograph many people before they
sprung to stardom such as one James Franco which I photographed many times. </p>
<p>Photography has brought me unlimited experiences that few
would never dream of doing. It brought me people that would have never crossed
my path in life, and friendships that will last for a lifetime. It gave me
something to live for when my mom died, and there is not a day that goes by without
photography touching me. My mom sacrificed many, many things in her life to see
that I became the best photographer that I could. Overcoming obstacles are
almost a daily occurrence. But as my mom showed me, by her faith in me and my

<p>After giving up my photography studio due to the economy, I

New Horizons in North Hills for a new start in life, where they help people
with disabilities. Soon after I found a job through their programs and then
became a Board Member and event photographer for the growth of their
clients.  Next, through a
publisher of a magazine which I shot for, they wrote an article about growing
up handicap, finding my sexual identity, and also becoming a well-known
photographer here in Los Angeles. The Center saw that article in August 2013,
and asked me if I would be a part of this new LGBTQ Special Needs Group, where
I am still today. I was just asked to take over for Kyle, the developer of the
group, once he leaves for new ventures. What a big honor! First I was immediately
apart of The Center’s film festival because they saw my James Franco pictures
and was asked to put some up for the event. It was a success and that is how I
got involved with The Center.</p>
<p>The Center in Long Beach is a non-profit community center whose
mission statement is “As the central core of the Greater Long Beach LGBT
communities we offer assistance and provide education about emotional and
physical health, housing, cultural and social activities, and legal and social
justice. We advocate for the inclusion of all with no judgment or restrictions
based on sexual orientation or gender identity.” It is formally called The
LGBTQ Center Long Beach. I am proud to be showing my work in their gallery and

support, knowledge, information, testing, and help for many everyday problems.</p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/493031/files/20140408093342-3__Lana_Clarkson_100_DPI_IND.jpg?1396974822"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p> ***<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Lana was a regular friends that photographed at my studio with me very often.***</span></p><p><b style=""line-height: 1.45em;""><u>My personal thoughts on my campaign:</u></b><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""> </span><br/></p><p>I am very excited to once again, after many years of personal growth in life, that I am coming back home to my life’s gift and talent as a photographer.

<p></p></div>","About my project the Mark Studner Exhibit:

Thank you for taking the time to consider supporting my solo
exhibit at The Center in Long Beach in May & June 2014. This is a very
exciting time for me and an opportunity to re-launch my photography career. But
I am coming up short.  $3,000 to be
exact.  So I am coming to you, my
friends and admirers of my photography, to help bring my exhibit to life. The
$3,000 is the remaining amount required to professionally print my selected 30
images onto beautiful, large canvases for the exhibit.  I know nothing in life comes for free
and I have never been one to expect or ask for handouts in my life. In return
for your loving support, I am offering some very cool perks. Please take a moment
to have a look. 
This exhibit will be a very inspirational showing. I was
born with Cerebral Palsy, a condition in which doctors believed and said I
would never live a productive life. 
I set out to prove them wrong and took up photography as my outlet for
expression at the age of 10 years old and have never looked back.  Unfortunately, I, like many artists,
have been impacted by the economy. This will be the first show I have done in
15 years!
Through your support, we will be able to provide a source of
hope and inspiration. I am not just showing my photographs, but aiming to use
my art to give inspiration to people with any disabilities or any of life’s
barriers, and show that people can triumph.  
This exhibit will give my work the opportunity to be experienced
by 100’s of people by the LGBTQ community and anyone else who wishes to be
inspired.  My exhibit will include
a “meet and greet” reception at The Center on Saturday, May 24, 2014 from 5pm
to 9pm, where I would love to connect with all of you, face to face, surrounded
by the true story of my life; my art. The Center is at 2017 E. Fourth St in
Long Beach, CA 90814.
Personally, this exhibit is a testimony of my strength, my
love for photography and the people that I meet because of it, and for the
belief in myself where I did not give up on a dream that was forming for most
of my life. So, I am asking all of you to please make any donation you see fit
to turn my dream into a reality.
Thank you.Love,
Mark
Portrait of Mark Studner - graphite pencil drawing by David J. Vanderpool Copyright 2014 About My Life and
Photography-
My photography has spanned 35+ years since I first picked up
a camera. I went to a handicap school until 6th grade where I found my talent
with photography. Just for me picking up a camera at that age was an amazing
achievement because I was born with Cerebral Palsy (CP) which affected my
speech and my motor skill of walking and holding. But still, I had a minor form
of CP. My mom encouraged me to follow my dreams and as soon as people in the
community noticed my talent I was on my way to success despite of my
disability.
 I was the yearbook
photographer for all Junior High & High School and received an AA degree in
photo-journalism in college. I soon found myself at KROQ as a personal
photographer for the radio station taking photographs of bands such as Duran
Duran, R.E.M., Billy Idol and others. I also worked out of my home photo studio
and a dark room. I soon had many exhibits around Los Angeles in such places as
Rage and Figs West Hollywood, and Van Go’s Ear in Venice Beach. Due to their popularity,
numerous Los Angeles based magazines found me and put my work on their covers
including Edge, Frontiers, Fab and many others. I have worked with model and
talent agencies giving me the opportunity to photograph many people before they
sprung to stardom such as one James Franco which I photographed many times. 
Photography has brought me unlimited experiences that few
would never dream of doing. It brought me people that would have never crossed
my path in life, and friendships that will last for a lifetime. It gave me
something to live for when my mom died, and there is not a day that goes by without
photography touching me. My mom sacrificed many, many things in her life to see
that I became the best photographer that I could. Overcoming obstacles are
almost a daily occurrence. But as my mom showed me, by her faith in me and my
photography is that if you have the passion for something, anything is
possible.How I became

<p>My name is Richard Webb. I'm a native of Arizona.  I have a degree in Commercial Photography from Northern Arizona University and have been a freelance contributor and contract photographer for
Arizona Highways magazine for many years. <br/></p><p> I've learned that strong compositions,
beautiful lighting, and dramatic skies make the best landscape images. The same
elements also make for amazing Temple images. Creating powerful and inspiring images of LDS Temples has
become a passion of mine. <br/></p>
<p>Selling prints through Deseret Book and other LDS retail
outlets has given me the chance to build an audience, connect with fans, and
gain valuable feedback. The feedback I've received most is that Arizonans want
a calendar of their Temples!</p>
<p><b><u>Objective</u></b></p>
<p>My goal now is to create a 14-month calendar featuring the
five LDS Temples in Arizona. The calendar will actually have 16 Temple images,

We'll spend up to three hours where we can discuss and work on photographic techniques & concepts from beginning to advanced. The workshop is transferable. If you're not into photography, give it to somebody who is.Everybody who purchased 5 calendars or more (or dollar equivalent) is eligible. Introduction

My name is Richard Webb. I'm a native of Arizona.  I have a degree in Commercial Photography from Northern Arizona University and have been a freelance contributor and contract photographer for
Arizona Highways magazine for many years.  I've learned that strong compositions,
beautiful lighting, and dramatic skies make the best landscape images. The same
elements also make for amazing Temple images. Creating powerful and inspiring images of LDS Temples has
become a passion of mine. 
Selling prints through Deseret Book and other LDS retail
outlets has given me the chance to build an audience, connect with fans, and
gain valuable feedback. The feedback I've received most is that Arizonans want
a calendar of their Temples!
Objective
My goal now is to create a 14-month calendar featuring the
five LDS Temples in Arizona. The calendar will actually have 16 Temple images,
including the cover and an image on the year-at-a-glance page. It will make a great Christmas gift.Here are the images.>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>        Look to the right and click on one or more of the perks to buy.

Brian's Story: Too often dreams are left unrealized. 2014 was a tough year for my family and I. After recovering from a surgery for a ruptured Achilles tendon and seeing my dad go through surgery for lung cancer at Sunnybrook Hospital, it dawned that dreams should never pass you by.

Two of my dreams:

Go on an adventure (drive across Canada)

Publish my own magazine

With your help, these dreams won't pass me by.Pictures and stories collected from my cross country trip will be published in my own magazine.Hopefully the photos and magazine will inspire you to either realize your own dreams or go on an adventure.

photographing some of the great slate quarries of North Wales, as well as the

alone with my camera, usually during winter in changeable weather. It has

when the light is just right, my spirit is lifted just thinking about it. I
have been looking for inspiration to the work of Colin Prior; his images of the

When four people from different backgrounds decide to return to formal education to acquire new skills and extend their knowledge,they will as a matter of course form new friendships. This photography exhibition is the culmination of three years studying, and the professional relationship formed between people who have opted to step out of their comfort zone, and backed by the encouragement of tutors who could see their hidden potential, refine their artistic style and finally show it  proudly to the world.

dynamic images, showcasing the work of inspiring photographers.Photograph taken by Samir DaveEveryday, everywhere, there are new sights to behold and new experiences
 to share. this photography book serves to showcase the sights and 
experiences Kenya has to offer and with it we hope to inspire, surprise 
and fascinate.Photograph taken by Sam StogdaleAfter5 is about what you do once the sun faints over the horizon, it is 
about the time you give to the passions you set aside and the dreams you
 hope to make a reality one day but never get around to doing.Photograph taken by Georgina Goodwin100% of the money raised will be to produce this limited first 
edition coffee table book. It will be produced in large format 240mm x 
240mm and on high quality 170gsm silk paper with a hard cover UV varnish
 finish. There will be approximately 170 pages of 100 images.Our
 hope is that this book will reach the corners of the globe and inspire readers. Portions of the printed books will also be distributed to 
schools all over Kenya, with the hopes of inspiring our kids to see 
kenya through our eyes.Photograph taken by Thandiwe MuriuOn behalf of all the contributors, I would
 ask you to take a leap of faith and support this project. However small
 your contribution, it will go a long way to make this a reality. It's time
 we share the incredible talent and vision of these photographers with a
 wider audience. This is the platform and now is the time. Please share this project with your friends and family and feel free to contact me if you have any comments or questions.Thank you, Christina. www.after5.co.keinfo@after5.co.kePhotograph taken by Neil Thomas",6.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>A little about me...</h3>
<p>My name is Harvey Pullings, Jr. I'm a Chicago based filmmaker and photographer, born and raised on the south side of Chicago. I have always been interested in the urban landscapes that are often deemed gritty, crime ridden or ""economically depressed,"" as environments that exist outside of majority interest. Having grown up in both Chatham and Princeton Parks (a neighborhood not too far from Evergreen Park), I gained a diverse perspective of how Black citizens' lifestyles compare and contrast. The dynamics of religion, violence and social activity offer a complex look how we function and exist, and how influential the perspective is to our identities. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1530770998/zp3zmy4vcdvldyc8ejya.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>When I graduated from Columbia College Chicago, I wrote and directed my thesis short film,<i> To Those with Good Intent</i>, that followed the story of a young Black man from the south side of Chicago, whose aspirations for a well paying job and independence, leads him into violent dilemma. Now, I'm turning my attention to showcasing the real life environment and atmosphere, that I have both grown up in and am inspired by.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1530771454/m88wxxgwpmqgby5nboso.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p><i>Concrete &amp; Cashmere</i> is my first photo exhibit, presented by Raw Chicago Artists, held at the Metro Chicago on July 18th. The ""Cashmere"" of the showcase is the beauty of the urban visuals. The presentation Black citizens as more than statistic, and ""criminal,"" but rather strong, beautiful and majestic.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1530766393/a2bbc9lgvztirwrpp98n.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>The ""Concrete"" is the gritty, enforced beauty of my shoots with tattoo model, Kyla DeLacerda. All works that represent my view of Chicago's multi-faced Identity and aesthetic.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1530766890/bdi9spfvs9gg8ia9xrfj.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>This campaign is for donations and/or ticket sales, which will contribute towards my exhibit.  Your contributions will allow you to attend the event, seeing my work as well as other amazing Chicago artists, and help support myself as I continue my career as a photographer and filmmaker. You're helping shape my future.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<p><strong style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'>Why am I asking for funding?</strong></p>
<p>I have 20 pre-sale tickets for sale, that is a requirement for my participation in the event - with a <strong>deadline of July 11th</strong>. As of today, I have sold only 2. <strong>I'm asking for $400.00 (that is 22.00 for my remaining 18 tickets). Your donation towards my campaign, will go towards a pre-sale ticket(s) for the show. </strong>You are not required to attend, as the ticket can be given to someone who'd like to, or your donation can simply be 22.00 (or however much you choose to donate) that assists me in taking part in this opportunity.</p>

</div><div><h3> </h3></div></div>","A little about me...
My name is Harvey Pullings, Jr. I'm a Chicago based filmmaker and photographer, born and raised on the south side of Chicago. I have always been interested in the urban landscapes that are often deemed gritty, crime ridden or ""economically depressed,"" as environments that exist outside of majority interest. Having grown up in both Chatham and Princeton Parks (a neighborhood not too far from Evergreen Park), I gained a diverse perspective of how Black citizens' lifestyles compare and contrast. The dynamics of religion, violence and social activity offer a complex look how we function and exist, and how influential the perspective is to our identities. 

When I graduated from Columbia College Chicago, I wrote and directed my thesis short film, To Those with Good Intent, that followed the story of a young Black man from the south side of Chicago, whose aspirations for a well paying job and independence, leads him into violent dilemma. Now, I'm turning my attention to showcasing the real life environment and atmosphere, that I have both grown up in and am inspired by.

Concrete & Cashmere is my first photo exhibit, presented by Raw Chicago Artists, held at the Metro Chicago on July 18th. The ""Cashmere"" of the showcase is the beauty of the urban visuals. The presentation Black citizens as more than statistic, and ""criminal,"" but rather strong, beautiful and majestic.

The ""Concrete"" is the gritty, enforced beauty of my shoots with tattoo model, Kyla DeLacerda. All works that represent my view of Chicago's multi-faced Identity and aesthetic.

This campaign is for donations and/or ticket sales, which will contribute towards my exhibit.  Your contributions will allow you to attend the event, seeing my work as well as other amazing Chicago artists, and help support myself as I continue my career as a photographer and filmmaker. You're helping shape my future.
 

Why am I asking for funding?
I have 20 pre-sale tickets for sale, that is a requirement for my participation in the event - with a deadline of July 11th. As of today, I have sold only 2. I'm asking for $400.00 (that is 22.00 for my remaining 18 tickets). Your donation towards my campaign, will go towards a pre-sale ticket(s) for the show. You are not required to attend, as the ticket can be given to someone who'd like to, or your donation can simply be 22.00 (or however much you choose to donate) that assists me in taking part in this opportunity.
(Note: Indiegogo requires the minimum for crowdfunding to be 500.00. This is a figure pursued only by the site's guidelines. The figure needed is $400.00. The extra 100.00 will be allocated to printing materials for the event, as well as photo framing)
Where are your funds going?
All funds  go to Raw Artists Chicago, an organization that showcases artists of various media, giving them platforms to show their artistry within large scale events. Ticket sales go towards the necessities of making these showcases possible for each artist. If my financial goal is not met by the time of this campaign's end, Raw Chicago  requires for all artists to contribute their available ticket sales, even after the deadline given. Proof can and will be given to all contributors, to prove the usage of funds.

<h3>Introducing <strong>In a World of Their Own: Carnival Dreamers and Makers, Photographs by Maria Nunes</strong>
</h3>
<p>A lot of what I see and hear when people talk about “Traditional Mas” or “Traditional Carnival” in Trinidad and Tobago is a view from the outside. A few years ago, a seed started to grow within me of wanting to share the stories of the people I photograph from their perspective as much as I could – to share a view of Carnival traditions from the inside. I wanted to celebrate the extraordinary Carnival men and women I’ve been privileged to photograph and to share the deep wonder, admiration and respect I have for them. As such, my photography has become a conscious decision to bear witness to their commitment and creativity, which is often lost or overlooked, within the wider canvas of Carnival. The more I’ve immersed myself in the many worlds of Carnival, the more I’ve seen that, through photography, I have a responsibility to the people who live for Mas: to be one of their storytellers.</p>
<p><i>In a World of Their Own</i> travels through time and space in Carnival, from the preparation beforehand, to the last rays of light at dusk on Carnival Tuesday. You’ll join me on my route through Belmont, the Savannah, East Port of Spain and South Quay. You’ll find yourself in Paramin, Perseverance Village, Arima, Moruga, Mayaro, Debe and San Fernando. And throughout this journey you’ll have voices to contemplate too. Juxtaposed with the photographs are extracts of interviews done over the past seven years with several of the dreamers and makers pictured in the book. These are woven in in such a beautiful way! They offer a precious glimpse of the depth of our Carnival dreamers and makers’ passion for Mas, while a beautiful and lyrical essay by Shivanee Ramlochan contributes important thoughts on archive and document. <i>In a World of Their Own</i> is, therefore, not just a book of photographs, but an invitation to the reader to look and think beyond the apparent surface.</p>
<p><strong>In a World of Their Own</strong><br/>Approximately 300 colour and black and white images<br/>10"" x 10""<br/>216 pages, 150gsm silk paper<br/>Smyth-sewn (lay flat) binding<br/>Hardcover, with paper wrap</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1519695854/pd575rwprq3cetsmt4n7.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p><strong>Features:</strong><br/>An introductory essay by Shivanee Ramlochan, with excerpts of interviews conducted with Steffano Marcano, Adrian Young, Alan Vaughan, Kemoi Harper, Tekel ‘Salti’ Sylvan, Shynel Brizan, Stephanie Kanhai, Lionel Jagessar Senior, Desmond Noel, Etienne Charles, Narcenio ‘Señor’ Gomez, Ronald Alfred, Tracey Sankar-Charleau, Darlington ‘Boysie’ Henry, Narrie Approo, Anderson Patrick, and Wendell Manwarren.<br/> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1519696132/vxtqp6rguuzixo8bzr0c.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Why This Book is Needed, and Why Now</h3>
<p>Although I’ve been photographing Trinidad Carnival’s dreamers and makers for ten years now, something shifted when I started sharing those images on social media. A lot of people started liking and commenting on the images but, more importantly to me, they started sharing them. One of my friends recently told me that my photographs have helped to revive interest in traditional Carnival in Trinidad. I certainly hope that’s true, and I can only imagine that this book would take that interest further and deeper, to help us better understand our culture, and to help set in stone the important role that these individuals play. Documenting is important – it’s a fantastic thing to be able to hold up a mirror to someone; to help them to see themselves and, through images, to pay respect to the work that they are doing.</p>
<p>With this book, I hope to offer an alternative perspective to the repeated – and often unfounded – narrative that Carnival traditions are dying and are mainly the concern of an older generation. To be sure, there is an ongoing struggle to keep some traditions going, but to mindlessly cut and paste that clichéd mantra is to miss the reality that so many Carnival artists today are a younger generation bringing new energy to the Carnival space and actively taking the mantle of responsibility for cultural vibrancy from their elders. Their work is the marriage of new ideas and tradition and their creativity is a real-time response within Carnival as a whole. They need our active support and encouragement.</p>

<h3> </h3>
<h3>Where I'm At</h3>
<p>I’ve had a book on my mind for the past couple of years and I recently decided to get going on making it a reality. Over the past eight months I’ve engaged a fantastic, T&amp;T based art book publisher, <a href=""http://robertandchristopher.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Robert &amp; Christopher Publishers</a> (R&amp;C), and I’ve raised 75% of the book’s total budget through the generous support of <a href=""https://www.republictt.com/power-to-make-a-difference"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Republic Bank Limited</a> (through their Power to Make a Difference programme), <a href=""http://www.massygroup.com/Community/Massy_Foundation/About_the_Foundation.aspx"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Massy Foundation</a>, Ministry of Community Development, Culture and the Arts, and Monlo Music Ltd. I’ve spent months going through thousands of images with the book’s editors, Melanie Archer and Mariel Brown, in order to make the final cull of the 300 photographs that appear in <i>In a World of Their Own</i>. We’ve spent a lot of time and care as well in getting the interviews transcribed and selecting excerpts. Trinidadian writer, <a href=""http://shivaneeramlochan.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Shivanee Ramlochan</a>, has paid beautiful tribute to the dreamers and makers pictured here, and has written so wonderfully on the importance of archive. <i>In a World</i>’s designer, artist <a href=""http://www.richardmarkrawlins.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Richard Mark Rawlins</a> has made beautiful sense of so much content and, inspired by the people in the book, has even added a bit of his own brilliant, original artwork that will enhance the stories being told. As I write this, the book is a few short days from being sent to our selected printer in Canada.<i> In a World of Their Own</i> will be launched on April 24th, 2018 in Port of Spain, as part of the annual <a href=""https://www.bocaslitfest.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">NGC Bocas Lit Fest</a>.<br/> </p>
<h3><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1519697603/x83y9ok31f68da7puxoz.jpg"" src=""""/></h3>
<p> </p>
<h3>What I Need and What You Get</h3>
<p>One of the most important things to me, in terms of the physical aspects of this book, is that it is beautifully printed and bound, ensuring its durability, especially as I envision it not as a book you look at once and put down, but something that you would want to revisit time and time again. Taking those factors into account, I made the decision to print the book outside of T&amp;T – in Canada, to be precise – in order to achieve the highest possible quality printing and lay-flat, sewn binding, which will help increase the book’s durability and ease of reading. Those standards have, of course, increased the cost as well, but I believe them to be very important.</p>
<p>I’ve covered all of the book’s other expenses to date, but now I need to raise the cost of printing. If you live in Trinidad &amp; Tobago, you would understand how difficult it currently is to get foreign exchange. Launching an Indiegogo campaign for <i>In a World of Their Own</i> is a great way for me to get the foreign currency I need to cover my printing bill. It also provides a fantastic outlet through which I can track and fulfill advance orders of the book.</p>
<p>By contributing to this Indiegogo campaign, you will help bring to completion this important document of Trinidadian culture and Carnival, as well as show your support for numerous Carnival dreamers and makers, my work, and also local publishing.</p>
<p><strong>Your contributions can come in several forms:</strong><br/>1. Advance orders<br/>2. Advance orders with added perks<br/>3. Perks<br/>4. Donations</p>
<p>I’m pleased to be able to offer limited edition prints of a few of my most loved images as perks. I’ll be releasing those in the the coming weeks. Please check out the column at the right of this text to have a look at the available perks, and follow me on <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/marianunesphotography/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Facebook</a> and <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/marianunesphotography/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Instagram</a> for updates!</p>

In a World of Their OwnApproximately 300 colour and black and white images10"" x 10""216 pages, 150gsm silk paperSmyth-sewn (lay flat) bindingHardcover, with paper wrap

Features:An introductory essay by Shivanee Ramlochan, with excerpts of interviews conducted with Steffano Marcano, Adrian Young, Alan Vaughan, Kemoi Harper, Tekel ‘Salti’ Sylvan, Shynel Brizan, Stephanie Kanhai, Lionel Jagessar Senior, Desmond Noel, Etienne Charles, Narcenio ‘Señor’ Gomez, Ronald Alfred, Tracey Sankar-Charleau, Darlington ‘Boysie’ Henry, Narrie Approo, Anderson Patrick, and Wendell Manwarren. 

 
Why This Book is Needed, and Why Now
Although I’ve been photographing Trinidad Carnival’s dreamers and makers for ten years now, something shifted when I started sharing those images on social media. A lot of people started liking and commenting on the images but, more importantly to me, they started sharing them. One of my friends recently told me that my photographs have helped to revive interest in traditional Carnival in Trinidad. I certainly hope that’s true, and I can only imagine that this book would take that interest further and deeper, to help us better understand our culture, and to help set in stone the important role that these individuals play. Documenting is important – it’s a fantastic thing to be able to hold up a mirror to someone; to help them to see themselves and, through images, to pay respect to the work that they are doing.
With this book, I hope to offer an alternative perspective to the repeated – and often unfounded – narrative that Carnival traditions are dying and are mainly the concern of an older generation. To be sure, there is an ongoing struggle to keep some traditions going, but to mindlessly cut and paste that clichéd mantra is to miss the reality that so many Carnival artists today are a younger generation bringing new energy to the Carnival space and actively taking the mantle of responsibility for cultural vibrancy from their elders. Their work is the marriage of new ideas and tradition and their creativity is a real-time response within Carnival as a whole. They need our active support and encouragement.
 

 
Where I'm At
I’ve had a book on my mind for the past couple of years and I recently decided to get going on making it a reality. Over the past eight months I’ve engaged a fantastic, T&T based art book publisher, Robert & Christopher Publishers (R&C), and I’ve raised 75% of the book’s total budget through the generous support of Republic Bank Limited (through their Power to Make a Difference programme), Massy Foundation, Ministry of Community Development, Culture and the Arts, and Monlo Music Ltd. I’ve spent months going through thousands of images with the book’s editors, Melanie Archer and Mariel Brown, in order to make the final cull of the 300 photographs that appear in In a World of Their Own. We’ve spent a lot of time and care as well in getting the interviews transcribed and selecting excerpts. Trinidadian writer, Shivanee Ramlochan, has paid beautiful tribute to the dreamers and makers pictured here, and has written so wonderfully on the importance of archive. In a World’s designer, artist Richard Mark Rawlins has made beautiful sense of so much content and, inspired by the people in the book, has even added a bit of his own brilliant, original artwork that will enhance the stories being told. As I write this, the book is a few short days from being sent to our selected printer in Canada. In a World of Their Own will be launched on April 24th, 2018 in Port of Spain, as part of the annual NGC Bocas Lit Fest. 

 
What I Need and What You Get
One of the most important things to me, in terms of the physical aspects of this book, is that it is beautifully printed and bound, ensuring its durability, especially as I envision it not as a book you look at once and put down, but something that you would want to revisit time and time again. Taking those factors into account, I made the decision to print the book outside of T&T – in Canada, to be precise – in order to achieve the highest possible quality printing and lay-flat, sewn binding, which will help increase the book’s durability and ease of reading. Those standards have, of course, increased the cost as well, but I believe them to be very important.
I’ve covered all of the book’s other expenses to date, but now I need to raise the cost of printing. If you live in Trinidad & Tobago, you would understand how difficult it currently is to get foreign exchange. Launching an Indiegogo campaign for In a World of Their Own is a great way for me to get the foreign currency I need to cover my printing bill. It also provides a fantastic outlet through which I can track and fulfill advance orders of the book.
By contributing to this Indiegogo campaign, you will help bring to completion this important document of Trinidadian culture and Carnival, as well as show your support for numerous Carnival dreamers and makers, my work, and also local publishing.
Your contributions can come in several forms:1. Advance orders2. Advance orders with added perks3. Perks4. Donations
I’m pleased to be able to offer limited edition prints of a few of my most loved images as perks. I’ll be releasing those in the the coming weeks. Please check out the column at the right of this text to have a look at the available perks, and follow me on Facebook and Instagram for updates!

 
Other Ways You Can Help

If you aren’t in a position to contribute financially or to pre-order books, please put in a good word for my project and post, tweet and share this page, every bit helps (and use the Indiegogo share tools whenever possible).
If you have any questions, please send them my way, I'd be glad to hear from you! Email me at nunesie2@gmail.com
Thanks again for all your support.

<h3>THE STORY</h3>
<p>In April 2015, I left my well-paying job and comfortable life in Singapore to go to New York to take on an unpaid internship. I had been working for a few years as a photographer but felt that I needed to sharpen my craft. So, I looked to the Big Apple. I wanted to know what caused the gap between the work in Singapore and those that I had seen from the U.S. After five months in New York, I spent another four in Los Angeles immersing myself in film sets to expand my lighting skill.</p>
<p>Between those two cities, I also travelled around the region. I started my backpacking trip in the Caribbean in Cuba and subsequently went to Haiti, Peru, Bolivia, Chile, Mexico and a few other countries. I wanted to experience cultures that were different from mine and learn from their way of life. My perspectives were expanded each day by the different environments and people that I interacted with. I also photographed extensively during this period, trying to form my unique way of seeing the world.</p>
<p>WAKING UP IN STRANGE PLACES is borne out of my desire to make those experiences and memories tangible for myself, and hopefully for others as well.</p>

<p>The zine is designed by <a href=""http://donotdesign.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Do Not Design</a> (the irony, I know). We went through a long process of conceptualization to bring different ideas and themes together. The final design has 67 images and some writing from my journal that are condensed into five unique chapters. They are bound together by a special material (you have to buy it to know!). This material allows the reader to re-arrange the chapters in any way that they want. Therefore, there is no fixed way of viewing or displaying the zine. The viewer decides their own version of my journey.</p>
<p>The zine also includes some postcards of my photographs. I sent out postcards frequently when I was on the road and I hope that the reader will do the same. There are also pages which are large enough that they can be displayed as prints and hung on the wall. All in all, the zine is bigger, deeper and larger than the sum of its parts.</p>

<p>In another reality, I think I was a busker. I actually picked up the guitar at roughly the same time I discovered photography. The camera stuck, the guitar not so much. But in some mirror universe, who knows? Perhaps this is why I enjoy photographing them so much, why I find them such fascinating subjects—it’s a look into the Path Not Taken.</p>
<p>On a deeper level, though, I think my fascination stemmed from envy. Buskers are modern day vagabonds, minstrels singing for their supper. They were faced with a choice and said, “I’d rather lead  a humble, dollar-to-dollar life doing something I love than a comfortable, secure life doing something I don’t.” I was faced with the same choice and said “Well, I’ve got bills to pay so I have to keep the day job. How about nights and weekends?” </p>

<p></p>
<p>So yeah, I was a bit jealous. I wanted nothing more than to quit and go full-time with my photography, but I couldn’t pull the trigger. Even after eight years of cubicle hell, I couldn’t bring myself to leave the security of my job.</p>
<p>Then I got laid off.</p>
<p>I’ve heard that most people feel lost when they’ve been laid off. I felt relieved. Just like that, I didn’t have a job to hide behind anymore. And the very company I’d been trying to muster the courage to leave just paid me a bunch of money to go away. This was my moment to put up or shut up and see if I really had what it took to do this full time.</p>

<p></p>
<p>So I dove right in. And while momentum was slow to build, it was getting better and it was looking more and more like there might be a viable career in photography for me, after all. It was gonna be a slim first few months (and thank god for severance), but it was looking promising.</p>
<p>Then someone stole my gear bag.</p>
<p>I was photographing my friends one night and took my eyes off my camera bag just long enough for someone to make off with over $4,000 worth of equipment. Insurance covered some (barely half) but there’s still a pretty big chunk missing.</p>
<p>When I got laid off I saw it as an opportunity. To make an earnest go of a career in photography. In the same way, this theft is a challenge. To see if I’ve got what it takes. If my photography can’t even pay for itself, how can it pay for me?</p>

<h2><b>The Campaign</b></h2>
<p>Over the last four months or so I’ve been photographing buskers in and around New York City for a photoblog called <b><a href=""http://www.newyorkfreeharmonic.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">The New York Freeharmonic</a></b>. I’ll be printing a collecting some of my favorite photos as well as previously-unpublished shots and new content shot exclusively for the book and am turning to Indiegogo to see if I can at least sell enough of them to cover the loss of my gear. </p>
<p></p>
<h2><b>The Book</b></h2>
<p></p>
<p>The book will be 100 pages, hardbound, printed on a silk semi-gloss 100lb paper that is both acid and lignin-free through Mixbooks. Each copy will be signed and numbered, and come with a photo postcard, perfect for use as a bookmark. The book will be 8”x6” in size, though if by some chance more than 250 books are ordered, the price point will drop and I’ll be able to afford to print them at 11”x8.5” at only a slight cost on my part.</p>
<p>In addition to the books I am also offering matted prints, discounted photo shoots (stop by <b><a href=""http://www.focalmatter.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">my site</a></b> to see samples of my work!), and more. Rewards will ship in November, making them great gift ideas.. Photo books are perfect gifts for those people you don’t wanna bother puzzling over gift ideas for but still want to get them something “nice.” Like in-laws.</p>

<h2><b>The Goal</b></h2>The goal of $2,500 is the break-even point. Hit that and at the very least the campaign doesn't wind up costing me money. From there, any extra pledged money will mean I'll be able to offer more to the donors—a few extra pages in the book, maybe. Or a free 8x10 print. And of course, hitting the magic ""250"" number means I'll be able to print the books at a bigger size.<p></p>

<h2><b>Other ways to help</b></h2>

<h3>CONTRIBUTOR PRIORITY LEVELS WHEN ACCESSING THE FREE ""LITE"" STUDIOS </h3>
<p>As you can see in our perk
descriptions, every contributor has his own priority level.  </p>
<p>1. Priority Level 1 means, whenever
you stand in a queue, you immediately become the first in the queue, unless
other Level 1 users are already standing there.</p>
<p>Level 1 also allows you to
schedule your future photo shoots in the Lite Studios, by selecting from
available dates and hours.</p>
<p>2. Priority Level 2 means, whenever
you stand in a queue, you will immediately become the first in the queue,
unless other Level 2 users are already standing in the queue, and unless any Level
1 user decides to stand there. In this case you will be standing immediately
after them.</p>
<p>3. Priority Level 3 means that
whenever you stand in a queue, you will immediately become the first in the
queue, unless other Level 3 users are already standing in the queue, and unless
any Level 2 or Level 1 user decides to stand there. In this case you will be
standing immediately after them. <br/></p>

<p></p>
<h3>NO FLAKE MODELS, NO MODELS BEING LATE</h3>
<p>Many photographers are familiar with a situation when they schedule a photo shoot with a model, but the model is being late or even flakes (no call, no show). Preparing the studio and sitting and waiting for a model that never shows... Ugh, what may be worse?</p>
<p>In the online studio studio all models will always be available as scheduled and schedule of every model will be publicly viewable on site.<br/></p>
<br/><h3>REFERRAL PROGRAM</h3>
Help
us by spreading the word via email and social media. After the campaign is
funded we'll refund your contribution in accordance with credits you earned
referring people.<br/><br/>
In short: if you successfully refer a friend to contribute to the campaign,
then we will refund you $50. If you refer one more friend – we will refund you
another $50. And so on. <br/><br/>
If the amount of credits you earned has covered the sum of your pre-ordered
package (so you get a complete refund), any further referral $ will be credited
to your account. After the studio goes live, you can spend these $ for getting
the PRO studio access. And don’t forget, as a contributor, you also have up to
70% Pro discount, as well as you have a priority access to the free Lite
Studios.<br/><br/>Please note that contributors cannot receive referral 
credit for referring themselves. Of two contributors, only one can be 
the 'referrer' and receive campaign credit for the other's 
contribution.  Refunds will be made and credits applied once the 
campaign is over.<br/><br/>How to participate in the referral program:<br/>It’s
 simple. Log in to your Indiegogo account . Be sure to use the same 
account you used when you contributed your Remote Studio Package. Then, 
look below our main video at the top of this page for buttons to share 
and copy your unique URL. Start sharing!<br/><br/>Need more information?  We have created detailed instructions <a href=""http://topmodelgroup.com/en/component/k2/item/43-referral-program"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here</a>.<br/><br/>

2. We have the tethering code to remotely set camera settings, obtain a live-view
from the camera, release camera shutter, download files, etc. For both Canon
and Nikon.<br/>
3. We have a streaming server and browser client to perform a low-latency streaming of the
camera's live view to your browser through the web, and control the camera. It is reliable and proven to work with a very low latency even if you're in USA or Australia when the studio is in Europe.<br/><br/>
Hardware:<br/>
1. We have already tested third-party pan-tilt heads for this system. They work
fine, they are reliable and not expensive.<br/>
2. We performed some testing for vertical/horizontal sliding of the entire
system (will be mounted on vertical and horizontal rails). Not ideal yet, but
OK.<br/>
3. All devices (motors, lighting) are interfaced with Raspberry Pi via Arduino (single-board microcontroller, intended to make building interactive objects or environments more accessible). <br/></p>

<h3>WHAT WE NEED</h3>
<p>Software:<br/>
1. We need to implement a web interface to flawlessly control the local code mentioned
above (both positioning and tethering) via the web.<br/>
2. We need to build the website: designing the layout, managing user accounts,
managing access permissions to different studios, queuing and scheduling access
to free studios, priority access for contributors, etc. This is possibly the
most trivial part, but at the same time the most boring and expensive stage of
the software part of the project.</p>
<p>Hardware:<br/>
As said above, we still need some working over the horizontal/vertical sliding
system. </p>
<p>Other:<br/>
We need a photo studio itself including:<br/></p>
<ol>
<li> Placement - we are going to acquire ownership of the estate property to get
rid of rental fees, because this will significantly reduce the price of the service
for end users. Therefore it will also be more profitable to us, so this is a
win-win solution.</li>
<li><span> Equipment for the studios.</span></li>
</ol>
<br/>
<p><span></span></p>
<h3>QUESTIONS &amp; ANSWERS</h3>
<p></p>
<p><span>1.<span>  </span></span>How many photo studios are planned?</p>
<p>At first,
we will start with four photo studios located in the adjacent rooms of the same
building. If we’ll see the service is demanded, we will increase the number of
studios, as we don’t feel lack of photo models.</p>
<p>2.<span> 
</span>The life
cycle of the shutter of a camera is limited. How often will you replace cameras
in a studio? This might be costly. </p>
<p>While testing
our business model, we revealed that the most active and tireless photographers
take about 10 shots per minute during a 30-minutes photo session. The production
cost of one shot in terms of the resource of a shutter is calculated as $0.016
per shot (the average market price of Canon 5D Mk3, $2400, divided by the life
cycle of a shutter claimed by the company - 150,000 actuations). For Nikon D800
costs are even lower. Therefore, in terms of camera’s resources the cost of production
of one hour of the most intensive shooting is 10*60*0.016=$9.6. This sum pays
off by additional paid services. Also, we carry on negotiations with potential
sponsors - photo equipment vendors interested in supporting the project if it
proves to be demanded.</p>
<p><span>3.<span>  </span></span>Professional models working in two
free photo studios and two low-cost ones – sounds good, but how you are going
to pay them? What is the source of the funds?</p>
<p>We are the
founders of the TopModelGroup.com portal, model agents recruiting and training
models. Among other countries, we also work in several developing economies
where hourly rates are much lower (several and even dozens of times) than in
US, Europe and other developed countries. Such countries are Moldova, Ukraine,
Byelorussia, which is geographically located in Europe, but are actually
developing economies with average monthly salary about $400. </p>
<p>After finishing
training and before signing an international contract (that means earning real money), our every model must
complete a 6-month probation. During this period they get a salary typical to
the country they live in. At the same time, they are already top-class models
passed through our hard training and possessing stunning looks. Due to the same
reason we don’t have to overpay to such specialists as make up artists and hair
stylists. Our first photo studio will be opened in one of such countries, and
further in other countries too.</p>
<p><span>4.<span>  </span></span>Ok, hiring even the best models is
not expensive for you. But what about rental fees for a photo studio? They are
still high. How can you keep prices low and even more – offer free services as
well?</p>
<p>We plan to acquire
ownership of the photo studio, because this will allow us to get rid of monthly
rental fees and therefore minimize prices for end users. Thanks God, real
estate costs are low in the countries we are talking about comparing with USA
or Europe.</p>
<p>Free studios
are funded by paid studios.</p>
<p><span>5.<span>  </span></span>What if you won’t receive backing in
full?</p>
<p>All promised
bonuses for our backers will remain valid. Partial funding means we will embody
our idea step by step. Instead of four studios, we will stop on just two (one
Lite and one Pro). The entire process may slow down, but we'll complete it anyway.<br/></p>
<p><span>6.<span>  </span></span>What if you will see more backing
than you ask?</p>
<p>In that case
we will equip more photo studios, not just four, in proportion to received funding
in order to supply the demand and grant our bonuses to all contributors faster.</p>

CONTRIBUTOR PRIORITY LEVELS WHEN ACCESSING THE FREE ""LITE"" STUDIOS 
As you can see in our perk
descriptions, every contributor has his own priority level.  
1. Priority Level 1 means, whenever
you stand in a queue, you immediately become the first in the queue, unless
other Level 1 users are already standing there.
Level 1 also allows you to
schedule your future photo shoots in the Lite Studios, by selecting from
available dates and hours.
2. Priority Level 2 means, whenever
you stand in a queue, you will immediately become the first in the queue,
unless other Level 2 users are already standing in the queue, and unless any Level
1 user decides to stand there. In this case you will be standing immediately
after them.
3. Priority Level 3 means that
whenever you stand in a queue, you will immediately become the first in the
queue, unless other Level 3 users are already standing in the queue, and unless
any Level 2 or Level 1 user decides to stand there. In this case you will be
standing immediately after them. 



NO FLAKE MODELS, NO MODELS BEING LATE
Many photographers are familiar with a situation when they schedule a photo shoot with a model, but the model is being late or even flakes (no call, no show). Preparing the studio and sitting and waiting for a model that never shows... Ugh, what may be worse?
In the online studio studio all models will always be available as scheduled and schedule of every model will be publicly viewable on site.

I felt it immediately. Before the moving truck even left the curb I’d made a portrait. That year, in 2015, I started making street portraits of people in Bed-Stuy with my Rolleiflex film camera. At that time, I had no idea how extensive the series would become, or that I would have the opportunity to share it with people in the form of this beautiful book. Although all of my photography projects derive from a personal endearment, these photographs, set in the streets I call home, feel even more so. </p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1629412913/szc7bspr9q55v0s3qflm.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: center;"">from <i>Personal Ties: Bed-Stuy, Brooklyn</i></p><p> </p><p><strong>Published by Schilt Publishing, Amsterdam</strong></p><p>I’m looking for people who also feel a connection to these photographs.

I felt it immediately. Before the moving truck even left the curb I’d made a portrait. That year, in 2015, I started making street portraits of people in Bed-Stuy with my Rolleiflex film camera. At that time, I had no idea how extensive the series would become, or that I would have the opportunity to share it with people in the form of this beautiful book. Although all of my photography projects derive from a personal endearment, these photographs, set in the streets I call home, feel even more so. from Personal Ties: Bed-Stuy, Brooklyn Published by Schilt Publishing, AmsterdamI’m looking for people who also feel a connection to these photographs. I have already successfully fundraised to cover the cost of manufacturing the book on Kickstarter. Now, I would love to keep the option open for people to help me share the book with the Bed-Stuy community. I’m fortunate to partner with Schilt Publishing, a publisher based in in Amsterdam, the Netherlands, with worldwide distribution and an excellent reputation. Throughout the past several months, as we have been working on this project, owner Maarten Schilt and his team have demonstrated a strong commitment to both this book and me as a photographer, and I feel very confident these portraits are in the right hands. About the BookPersonal Ties: Bed-Stuy, Brooklyn is a fine art book of street portraits made in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, with a Rolleiflex film camera from 2015-2018 by Amy Touchette. The approximately 124-page book is 22cm by 26cm and includes roughly 60 color photographs. The foreword was written by legendary photographer Larry Fink and the afterword by third-generation Bed-Stuy resident C. Joi Sanchez. Also included is text I wrote explaining my process and experience making the photographs. Personal Ties: Bed-Stuy, Brooklyn will be released in November 2021 by Schilt Publishing. Fundraising DetailsAs you might imagine, street photography is not a terribly lucrative pursuit. Every project is a labor of love. Up until a month ago, these photographs were personally financed. I just completed a successful Kickstarter campaign to cover the costs of manufacturing the book. It is such an honor to be surrounded by so much support! But because part of my aim with this book is to share it with the community—Bed-Stuy schools, libraries, and residents—I started this Indiegogo campaign to allow people to continue to donate copies for this very designation.from Personal Ties: Bed-Stuy, Brooklyn Why This BookI have always used photography to shine the light on others. Eye contact is a gateway to empathy, and I really believe the more we look at each other, the more likely we are to realize that we are all in this together. Whether I am photographing in Hawaii, Japan, Malaysia, Vietnam, the American South, or in my own adopted backyard in Bed-Stuy Brooklyn, that has always been the goal of my photography projects. I hope we never stop looking at one another, acknowledging one another, and wishing one another the very best. from Personal Ties: Bed-Stuy, Brooklyn Praise for Personal Ties: Bed-Stuy, Brooklyn""Amy Touchette's loving portraits remind us that Brooklyn is still a multi-generational neo-African village in places, and optically Thriving While Black with transparent soul power.""—Greg Tate, Writer and musician""Amy Touchette has the rarest of gifts, she adores people and photography as much as life itself. People trust her because she is a bright, charming, gentle soul who is as timid as she is brave. Her eye doesn't judge, but while understanding our similarities, she celebrates our differences. Her images may seem as straightforward as she is, but they explore relationships that are fraught with imperfections. Looking at her pictures you will find all the joys and pain of the cards we are dealt.""—Amy Arbus, Photographer""Amy Touchette represents the new generation of documentary photographers who are contributing to preserving a very important history and culture in this 21st century. Arming herself with a camera and a compassionate heart, she photographed ordinary people in her Bedford-Stuyvesant community, creating intimate portraits of personal ties, kinship, and individuality that are now frozen moments in time.""—Jamel Shabazz, Photographerfrom Personal Ties: Bed-Stuy, Brooklyn Publishing & PrintingPersonal Ties: Bed-Stuy, Brooklyn will be published this fall by Schilt Publishing, a deliberately small, discerning publishing house based in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. I met owner Maarten Schilt in 2012 at a photo festival, and we have kept in touch ever since. In August 2020, I received an email from Maarten asking if I would like to collaborate on a book. I had been waiting for a special way to present these portraits of Bed-Stuy, which I had made between 2015 and 2018, and was thrilled when Maarten agreed the series would make a wonderful book. It's rare as a photographer to be contacted by a publisher (it's much more common for photographers to proposition publishers), so it is a great honor to have this opportunity.  

 
Personal Ties: Bed-Stuy, Brooklyn will be printed at Offizin Scheufele, a state-of-the-art facility in Stuttgart, Germany, that Schilt Publishing uses almost exclusively for their high-quality printing press. Established in 1808, Offizin Scheufele is a family-run business with a tradition of deep enthusiasm for printing that is committed to operating with the least greenhouse gas emissions possible.

<h3>A Little Bit of Alaska for You</h3>
<p>About a year ago, I began writing a few hiking guides to some less traveled areas in the state. Now, with your help, I am greatly expanding my online Alaska hiking and travel guide at <a href=""https://lwpetersen.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">lwpetersen.com</a>.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1619722867/vab1b3ecjuibem59byna.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p><i>Aurora borealis over Angel Rocks near Fairbanks - See the <a href=""https://lwpetersen.com/alaska-guide/angel-rocks/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Angel Rocks Hiking Guide here</a></i></p>
<p>Here are a few aspects this site includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Alaska hiking and travel guide</li>
<li>Aurora borealis photography and general photography guides and tutorials</li>
<li>Alaska wildflower identification guide</li>
<li>Science, aurora, atmospheric optics, and geology information about Alaska</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>My goal is to keep all of this information free and accessible to anyone. However, it's also quite expensive and time-consuming. I make a trickle of money from advertising and photo sales, but right now, it's far from break-even. Additionally, I have many side projects on the website that I'm also trying to start or expand on. This campaign aims to raise money to help with web hosting fees, equipment, and travel costs. Ultimately, your support helps me have the time to sit down and add more content quickly!</p>
<p>I've lived in Alaska for almost eleven years now. This is my way of sharing the experience with you and help you find your own experiences here!</p>

<h3>Hiking Guide and Travel Info</h3>
<p>Right now, <a href=""https://lwpetersen.com/alaska-guide/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the guide</a> includes about 30 hikes and destinations, all including maps with route info and detailed information about the area. Currently, I have 50 more on the drawing board or in draft, and plenty more destinations in mind over just the next year.</p>
<p>I try to focus on the less popular ""tourist"" destinations. Difficulty and risks are highlighted in each description, and I heavily advocate for traveling responsibly and following Leave No Trace principles. I hope to publish a physical guidebook in about 3 years.</p>

<h3>Alaska Wildflower Guide</h3>
<p>This has been one of the most rewarding side-projects to grow out of the guide. I've been photographing and compiling an informative <a href=""https://lwpetersen.com/alaska-wildflowers/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">identification guide for flowers in Alaska</a>.

<h3>Science - Aurora, Optics, Geology, and More</h3>
<p><a href=""https://lwpetersen.com/science/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Science</a> is the newest addition to the website. I find this funny now because when I started this website, it was originally called ""Physics in Alaska,"" and it was a blog about living in Alaska while going to graduate school for physics. Well, with my physics background and previous glaciology fieldwork, I'd like to share some of what I've learned over the years. Most of the articles are naturally going to be Alaska-themed. Some examples are <a href=""https://lwpetersen.com/science/ice-crystals-in-r-channels/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">ice crystal formations in glacier caves</a>, <a href=""https://lwpetersen.com/science/what-causes-the-aurora/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">what causes the aurora borealis</a>, and how our unique atmospheric (cold) conditions create all sorts of optical effects like <a href=""https://lwpetersen.com/atmospheric-optics/light-pillars/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">light pillars</a>.</p>

<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I'm looking to raise enough money for website registration fees for 3 years at the bare minimum. Paying for three years of registration up-front saves me well over $200/year, and I don't have to worry about the looming bill every month. That will only take roughly $2500 in fundraising, and I will be ecstatic if I can hit that. Beyond that, every little bit counts. Equipment expenses (camera, outdoor, safety), GPS upgrades for mapping ($600 one-time), Garmin InReach subscription fees ($600/year), park passes ($150/year annual passes), park fees and other fees (approx. $500/year), gas money, and all the little things really add up. Also, every dollar raised helps me afford the time to sit down and write more!</p>
<p>I'm offering a number of prints and wall art from my website at <a href=""https://photos.lwpetersen.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Lee Petersen Photography</a> as perks for helping me out. These are all printed by Bay Photo and shipped directly to you. I have paper prints, float metal prints, and acrylic prints available here. You can also opt for a postcard which I will send with a bit of info and GPS coordinates of the location so you can find it if you visit Alaska.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>As far as rewards go for you, there are no risks. I already operate an online shop selling prints. My biggest challenge is finding people willing to donate for content they can easily view for free. Of course, even if I raise nothing, I'll keep making guides because I enjoy doing it, and I want them to be accessible to everyone. However, creation will be much slower.</p>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">10 years of photography in one beautiful book<br/> </h3>
<p>We are portrait photographers <strong>Saara Salmi </strong>and <strong>Marco Melander</strong>. Together we formed the Neo-Victorian Photo Studio Atelieri O. Haapala, which was active between the years 2008–2016. We shot over 7,000 portraits, attending dozens of vintage events and burlesque parties.</p>
<p>Making a book out of these portraits was our plan from the very beginning. Now that Atelieri O. Haapala is nearing its tenth birthday in late 2018, we believe it is the perfect time to make that dream a reality. <strong>Finally!</strong></p>
<p><strong>Now we are getting together for the very last time to make this book.</strong> We are only going to have one shot at this. If we can't make this book now, it will never be done. Please help us!</p>
<p>We have managed to gather an amazing, super-qualified team to help us with this book. The book will be edited by curator <strong>Maria Faarinen</strong> (The Finnish Museum of Photography) and <strong>Lassi Patokorpi</strong> (International Committee of Museums Finland), a specialist in material culture. The visual appearance will be made by the super-talented graphic designer <strong>Paula Laitinen. </strong>What's more, apart from our team being top-notch in what they do, they have participated in our project in different ways during the years. <strong>That is to say: they know our project, our style and what we want to accomplish. We believe this will ensure we get the finest end product imaginable, truly done with passion and commitment.</strong></p>
<p>The book will be out in September 2018.</p>

(Tiivistelmä suomeksi sivun lopussa – Summary in Finnish below) 
Realising our dream
10 years of photography in one beautiful book 
We are portrait photographers Saara Salmi and Marco Melander. Together we formed the Neo-Victorian Photo Studio Atelieri O. Haapala, which was active between the years 2008–2016. We shot over 7,000 portraits, attending dozens of vintage events and burlesque parties.
Making a book out of these portraits was our plan from the very beginning. Now that Atelieri O. Haapala is nearing its tenth birthday in late 2018, we believe it is the perfect time to make that dream a reality. Finally!
Now we are getting together for the very last time to make this book. We are only going to have one shot at this. If we can't make this book now, it will never be done. Please help us!
We have managed to gather an amazing, super-qualified team to help us with this book. The book will be edited by curator Maria Faarinen (The Finnish Museum of Photography) and Lassi Patokorpi (International Committee of Museums Finland), a specialist in material culture. The visual appearance will be made by the super-talented graphic designer Paula Laitinen. What's more, apart from our team being top-notch in what they do, they have participated in our project in different ways during the years. That is to say: they know our project, our style and what we want to accomplish. We believe this will ensure we get the finest end product imaginable, truly done with passion and commitment.
The book will be out in September 2018.

What We Need

Your backing will help us cover the following expenditures (calculated according to an edition of 1000):

Printing 13,000€
Superb paper and print quality
Proper colour balancing
Embossing and gilding for the cover – to make it look like a cabinet card!
Quality control




Design 6,000€Outrageously exquisite graphic design true to our Neo-Victorian aesthetic by graphic designer Paula Laitinen



Writing and editing 4,000€
Professional curating and editing of the content by Maria Faarinen and Lassi Patokorpi

Two in-depth essays on Atelieri O. Haapala



Translations 1,500€Professional proof reading and translations

Packaging, marketing, operating costs, fees 1,000€

The Finnish Arts Council is supporting our project with an additional 8,000€. The grant is aimed at ensuring the best possible print quality for a photographic publication. We are very thankful for the support. This will definitely help us achieve the best results!
Altogether we are using 25,500€, with hopefully 17,500€ coming from you guys!

<h3>APPARITIONS</h3>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">apparition</span> |ˌapəˈri sh ən|</p>

<p class=""p2""><em><b>UPDATE</b>...We've surpassed the goal! Thank you to all my supporters!!! But, <em>It isn't over till it's over, and I still really need you.

<p class=""p2"">I always remember my first year of living in New York City, back in 1988. I was a few months from turning 22, and it was like stepping into an intense, bewildering movie, after an endless childhood in suburbia. The show was non-stop, 24-7. Every time I walked out my door something remarkable seemed to happen. I fell completely in love with the city, even when I hated it. I fed on its energy and variety. I felt like I was finally someplace <em>real, </em>and yet, the appartions around me were so <em>unreal</em>.</p>
<p class=""p2"">For the past several years I have been photographing life on the streets of New York City, almost daily. At first I just wanted to capture the oddities and outrageous sights I encountered in my daily routines, but as my dedication increased I began going out specifically to find and photograph the unlikely moments, memorable faces, and unexpected phenomenon that make life here so special to me. At this point, shooting the streets is the central focus of my life, an obsession like no other, and I'm ready to put the best of the work I've been doing into the form of a book: APPARITIONS.</p>
<p class=""p2"">In the past I have had photos of mine see publication on blogs like The Huffington Post, Gothamist, and NPR.org, and I've had work in group shows in Los Angeles, and at the Miami Street Photography Festival. Over the course of the last couple years, commenters on my photos on Flickr and Facebook have urged me to make a book, but until recently I wasn't ready. Now that I have a lot more photos to choose from, and the requests for a book have been growing louder and more frequent, I've decided the time is now.</p>
<p class=""p2"">I'll be publishing APPARITIONS myself in November of 2013, with an afterward by the transcendent writer &amp; musician Keir Neuringer. </p>

<p class=""p2"">I'm completely committed to making this book. To do it right I need your collaboration. If I can raise my goal of $5000, it will provide me with much needed resources for the final shooting, editing and printing of APPARITIONS, and allow me to develop and scan a backlog of exposed film.

<h3>THE PHOTOGRAPHY PROJECT</h3>
</div>
<div>
<p>P721K is a Brooklyn Special Education High School. The Student Council of 721K is looking forward to providing P721K students and staff with a professional photography experience. Through The Photography Project, 721K students will build the skills necessary to operate a digital photography studio. The objective of The Photography Project is to introduce students to a professional operational environment that will help develop skills and knowledge. The Photography Project will be successful at providing the students with work experience as well as insight to possible career options. The students will develop skills to follow task, pay attention to detail, and the importance of working on a team. </p>
<p>This year we have held two photography events in the building, both of which were very successful. We have seen a growth in interest from both students and staff in the field of photography. We as a school would love the opportunity to explore this field further. With The Photography Program we can help students develop the skills necessary to working in a photography studio, while teaching them the importance of visual documentation. </p>
<p>We have seen the success and now we are seeking to expand The Photography Project to provide the opportunity to all the students at P721K. Our proposal requests $4000 in funding to obtain a professional camera, hardware, software, and the appropriate computer to keep The Photography Project going. With the equipment we are requesting The Photography Project will be able to function more efficiently. </p>
<p>The Impact</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>The Photography Project is seeking funding to expand. The objectives of The Photography Project provide our students with skills that stem further then just photography. They will attain skills in working with computers, navigating software, working on team projects, leading, and directing various tasks. They will start to develop work experience and gain information that can later be added to a resume. Our proposal is influenced by our previous experience with out photography events in the school building. Funding in the amount of $4000 is requested for proper equipment and hardware that will remain reserved for student council members and various students at P721K.</p>

<h3>My Project:</h3>
<p>Hi! My name is Mathea Millman and I am a senior Cinema &amp; Photography major at Ithaca College. This semester I am in the Photo Workshop class which is the capstone photo class for my major. The goal of the course is to explore a photographic project over the entire semester and at the end create an exhibition to display the work. My photo class is having our group exhibition on December 14th, 2012 from 6pm-9pm at the Ithaca Business Campus (across the street from the main entrance of IC on Route 96B).</p>
<p>My project is based around the idea of feminine identity of adolescents as explored through portraiture. I am working with a group of high school girls to photograph and observe how they interact with each other and how they individually present themselves in front of a lens. Their self-awareness when being photographed is constantly in flux depending on who they are with, where they are, and how the photographer/subject relationship develops over time. </p>
<p>I am shooting large format film (my negatives are 4 inches by 5 inches) and hope to exhibit my pictures printed large and framed. Shooting large format is a relatively slow process and each image takes a lot of consideration. By photographing portraits in this medium, each subject becomes very self-aware that they are having their picture taken. This creates an interesting dynamic in the collaborative process that makes the portrait unique to this specific type of photography. </p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Artist's Statement (work in progress):</h3>
<p>Adolescent girls are constantly confronted with images of model ideals and the perfect woman in contemporary media. Because of this, new conceptions of representation emerge out of a constant need or compulsion to self-curate. They become hyper-aware of how they are presented to the world and how others are presented based on unattainable ideals. These external standards and pressures are influencing factors on the development of self-awareness. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>The Impact:</h3>
<p>This project is truly the culmination of a semester-long collaborative endeavor. The girls that I have been working with have given up countless hours to photograph and to explore these themes with me. I hope to encourage and inspire these girls as well as other young adolescent girls to open up a dialogue with each other about self presentation and a positive self-awareness that is based on affirmations of each other rather than an affirmation of adhering to societal standards. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Your contribution helps fund the purchase of...</h3>
<p>-The 4x5 film</p>
<p>-The print. Each image has to be printed individually on a special large inkjet printer. This covers the cost of the paper and ink. </p>
<p>-The Frame. Each print has to be framed. This covers the cost of matting each image as well as the frame itself, which is the largest expense of the project. </p>

<p>My name is Jay Belloli.  I have been a contemporary art curator or director at a number of museums in the United States.  In 1984 I was director of a gallery at Caltech.  I went to NASA's nearby Jet Propulsion Laboratory with ideas for an exhibition, saw the photographs sent back from JPL spacecraft, and my life completely changed.</p>
<p>I have now organized four international astronomy exhibitions.  My interest has kept coming back to Mars, because it is the only other planet in our solar system that could support human life.  And the more spacecraft go to the Red Planet, the more fascinating it becomes.   The existence of former streams and lakes have been discovered, maybe even a former ocean.</p>
<p>It was very important to me that people understand what amazing discoveries have been made about Mars, from astronomy drawings as early as 1659 through photographs coming in now from the Curiosity Rover.  And that people see the great Mars videos.  </p>

</div><p> </p></div>","My name is Jay Belloli.  I have been a contemporary art curator or director at a number of museums in the United States.  In 1984 I was director of a gallery at Caltech.  I went to NASA's nearby Jet Propulsion Laboratory with ideas for an exhibition, saw the photographs sent back from JPL spacecraft, and my life completely changed.
I have now organized four international astronomy exhibitions.  My interest has kept coming back to Mars, because it is the only other planet in our solar system that could support human life.  And the more spacecraft go to the Red Planet, the more fascinating it becomes.   The existence of former streams and lakes have been discovered, maybe even a former ocean.
It was very important to me that people understand what amazing discoveries have been made about Mars, from astronomy drawings as early as 1659 through photographs coming in now from the Curiosity Rover.  And that people see the great Mars videos.  
And it was important to me that people understand Mars has impacted popular culture.  The astronomer Percival Lowell in the late 19th century thought he saw canals on Mars, which meant a past or present civilization.  Famous writer H.G. Wells took that idea and wrote the classic ""The War of the Worlds,"" and Mars became part of pop culture. Many more wonderful Mars science fiction novels followed, numerous popular press articles, and finally the great Mars science fiction films starting in the 1950s.  These pop culture materials are also in the exhibition.
As a contributor, you will literally will make the exhibition possible: the printing, matting, and framing of the photographs, drawings, and film posters; the research assistant for the show; and the editing, design, and printing for the exhibition catalogue. The catalogue will have fascinating interviews with two JPL scientists and a world expert on Mars science fiction.  The budget for the exhibition is below.
""Mars; Astronomy and Culture"" is part of the Pasadena Arts Council Fiscal Sponsorship Program, so all donations are tax-deductible.  If you contribute $25, I'll send you a color Mars photograph.  $50, two color Mars photographs; $100, a signed copy of the catalogue; $250, two astronomy exhibition catalogues; $500, the two catalogues and a matted Mars photo; $1,000 the two catalogues, and a framed Mars photo, and your name will be listed in the catalogue; $2,500, all of that plus a private tour of the exhibition with me, and lunch; $5,000, all of that, and a JPL scientist involved with Mars will join us for lunch;  $10,000 all of that, and I will fly you to Pasadena at my expense for the tour and lunch with the scientist and me.

<p>My name is Maureen Agena, I am from Africa, a Ugandan by nationality but currently working and living in the Netherlands. </p>
<p>This campaign is to help one of Africa's top photojournalist Edward Echwalu recover all his camera gear valued at approximately ($20,000) that was stolen from him on 20th June 2013 in Kampala the capital city of Uganda amidst riots by Uganda taxi operators, protesting increased operation fees. Stolen amidst the chaotic event was Canon; 1D Mark IV, Canon 5D Mark II, Canon 16-35mm f2.8, Canon 24-70mm f2.8, Canon 70-200mm f2.8, Two hard drives, MacBook Pro 15 Inch, Two Pairs of  Sandisks 8GB memory Cards, Batteries for the cameras and other accessories.</p>
<p> Edward has been at the fore-front of nearly every major story in Uganda for the past five  years. Edward Echwalu is a Ugandan freelance professional photojournalist with <em>Reuters</em>, <em>Irin News</em> and <em>The Observer</em> (Uganda).  He was 1st Runner-Up, CNN Multichoice African Journalist of the Year Awards 2012 (Muhammed Amin Photographic Award - <a href=""http://edition.cnn.com/WORLD/africa/africanawards/finalists_2012.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://edition.cnn.com/WORLD/africa/africanawards/finalists_2012.html</a> ). He’s also the winner of Uganda's prestigious Cranimer Mugerwa Photojournalism Award 2009 (<a href=""http://www.newvision.co.ug/D/8/13/687819"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.newvision.co.ug/D/8/13/687819</a> ) and a top 10 finalist in the Africa Caribbean Pacific (ACP) Courier Photo Competition 2010. This is his blog: <a href=""http://echwaluphotography.wordpress.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://echwaluphotography.wordpress.com/</a></p>
<p>Your Contribution towards this noble cause will encourage him to continue documenting the African stories through powerful documentary photography and to remind him of the thousands who appreciate his amazing work. Africa as a continent has very few professional photographers, a statistic that is worse in Uganda. Uganda, composed of a largely illiterate population consume their news through radio and visual platform in which Edward Echwalu comes in handy. For as long as he remains without his working tools, potentially a population of 34 million is denied a chance to be informed, to be educated and a chance to be part of the democratic process of their country.</p>
<p>We need to raise $15,000 to contribute to Echwalu and enable him replace his stolen gear but also purchase better quality one. He is willing to top up whatever cannot be raised here but he will be greatful to have it all raised. We need to purchase Canon 1D Mark IV and Canon 5D Mark II as well as lenses: Canon 24-70mm f2.8, Canon 16-35mm f2.8 and 70-200mm f2.8.</p>
<p>We aso have special and unique perks for you among which include: A framed and signed portrait from one of Africa’s finest photographers, A free photo shoot when you visit Uganda, A CD with a collection of 10 of the pictures taken by Echwalu around Africa. Signed Soft Copy of your favourite picture on his blog.</p>
<p>This project is so valuable because for many reason; the African narrative has been characterized by pictures of disease, war, starvation and crime yet there is a positive side to the life on this continent. Helping a photojournalist like Edward tell the positive side to the story will help in educating many more about Africa but also tell the African story as an African Journalist.</p>
<p>This is the very first online campaign we are engaging in as most of them have been offline and successful. An example was fundraising for Landslide victims in Eastern Uganda in 2012 and also fundraising for the Nodding Disease children in Northern Uganda. I hope this will be a success.</p>
<p>We are aware that not each one of you is able to contribute money but we appreciate other ways of contribution like sharing this cause with your networks and encouraging others to contribute. Whatever the contribution, we shall appreciate. Indiegogo has a number of share tools that you can use.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>I have had a passion for aviation since I was very young, attending airshows where I watched through an airport or airbase fence for hours in awe. In late 2009 I was looking at some aviation photos and thought I would give it a try. In 2010 I had enough savings to pick up my first DSLR, a Canon XS. Shortly after that I got together with a local group who shared my passion for shooting aviation and there I gained a lot of knowledge and talent. From this experience I have learned everything I know about photography. My Canon broke while shooting an airshow in 2011 and I ended up with a Nikon D200 sold to me by a friend. I loved this camera as much as my Nikon so I am confident with both brands. All was going great and I was even working on a website to sell my work. A few weeks ago there was a tragedy at my house and I lost everything but my dogs and my computer. My photography was the thing that kept me going and I feel empty without a camera.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<ul>
<li>Before I lost my gear I was working on expanding my subjects. I had done work for Phoenix Comicon, a friends engagement party and I also had a small wedding booked all the while borrowing gear since mine was not up to par. </li>
<li>Right now I have a large collection of photos, I'm not one to say it's the best but I have been published and have sold prints, if you contribute to my fund I will make sure you get high quality copies of your choice whether it be framed, canvas or a disc of high resolution wallpapers.</li>
<li>With the money I raise I hope to regain as much gear as possible and if possible to expand on what equipment I had so I can shoot a wider variety of situations and subjects.</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Indiegogo wants me to describe the impact this funding will have. Well to put it simply photography is my passion and I could not imagine going a day without it. I get huge gratification from being able to share my work and at no time in my life have I had a hobby that I put so much effort into and loved every minute of it. People tell me it's only pictures but I wish they could experience the feeling of getting the perfect shot or better yet being in pursuit of that perfect shot. </p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<ul>
<li> I am in need of any kind of equipment since I am starting with zero but on top of that I could use anything from editing software,or a hard drive (3.5 SATA or external).</li>
<li> I could really use some help getting a website going maybe even getting some campaigns started on there to start raise additional money on top of my Indiegogo campaign.</li>
<li>If donating is not something you are able to do at this time I understand however another you could help me would be sharing my campaign. It would mean the world to me!</li>
