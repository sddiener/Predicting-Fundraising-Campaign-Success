<b>The Beginning</b><br/>
</h3>
<p>As with many inventions, <b>The Fusion Battery Boost</b> was invented
 in a very serendipitous fashion. Early in 2013 we began experimenting 
with the effects of ions on mobile phone radiation in hopes of creating 
an anti radiation cell phone accessory. During testing we realized that 
the insert was having another profound effect, it was lengthening 
battery life between charges.  We took this breakthrough and ran with 
it. </p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/968305/files/20141029064048-boost_photo.png?1414590048"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/><p></p>
<h3><b>The Technology</b></h3>
<p>Lithium Ion batteries suffer from a 
phenomenon called self discharge.  This is the process in which 
batteries degrade, causing poor performance.  Standard self discharge is
 5% after the first 24 hours of manufacturing and then 2% month after 
month.  However, these numbers accelerate if the battery is ever exposed
 to heat. Within just one year your lithium ion battery can lose a large
 portion of its capacity, which is very frustrating. </p>
<p>The ions 
inside of the battery are the workhorse of the unit, moving electricity 
back and forth during charge and discharge. However, these ions degrade 
during self discharge allowing valuable electricity to become waste. </p>
<p>The
 Fusion Battery Boost is designed to deliver a constant flow of ions to 
the battery, effectively reversing the effects of self discharge on 
battery performance.  It is also designed to reduce heat which promotes 
better battery health and longevity. The technology in the boost never 
wears out or decreases in ionic production.</p>
<p>In the video you will see the extreme ionic production of the Fusion Battery Boost. <br/></p>

<p>In addition to our internal research we have hired a certified battery and fuel cell lab to test and certify our results. <br/></p>

<h3><b>Test Study Group</b></h3>
<p>In addition to testing we rolled out a complete Test Study group to gain feedback on our product.  You can view the response <a href=""http://www.fusionbatteryboost.com/user-stories/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">HERE</a></p>
<p><i>""My phone never lasts through a round of golf.  Once I installed the 
Boost it made it thru 18 holes and drinks after allowing me to stay 
connected."" - Don<br/></i></p>
<h3><b>Universal Fit</b></h3>
<p>The
 Fusion Battery Boost has been designed to fit in or on any mobile 
phone. For best results it should be inserted inside the battery 
compartment. However, for enclosed batteries like the iPhone it can be 
attached to the back of the phone with double sided tape or sit in 
between the phone and the protective case.  It can also be trimmed for 
smaller older style phones. <br/></p>

<br/><h3><b>Green Initiative</b></h3>
<p>Our team at Fusion Battery Boost is 
proud to offer one solution to help address the energy crisis that 
effects us, our children and our children's children.  Luckily, when you
 use a Fusion Battery Boost you will get more battery life in between 
charges, cutting down energy consumption.  In addition, your phone will 
charge up faster allowing you to disconnect it and get on with your day.
 Shorter charging means less electricity use.  The Boost will ensure 
that you use every bit of electricity efficiently as opposed to it 
turning into waste. <br/></p>
<h3>
<b>Legal</b>
</h3>
<p>The Fusion Battery Boost has filed US Provisional 
Patent Application #620021182.  This gives us protection from July 6, 
2014.  Additionally, the protection extends internationally as well.</p>
<p>Additional
 provisions have also been applied for, to extend the product offering 
to various sizes and shapes of the Boost material, to fit various 
battery sizes.</p>
<p>Fusion Battery Boost has been fully trademarked.</p>
<h3><b>Manufacturing</b></h3>
<p>Fusion Technologies has a longstanding 
relationship with the mineral provider in Japan as well as the 
production factory in Shen Zhen, China. They have successfully 
manufactured and delivered hundreds of thousands of other similar 
product units on our behalf.  We have initially manufactured 10,000 units to have on hand for our initial distribution roll out. <br/></p>

Being an iPhone owner means you value design perfection, exceptional materials and state of the art technology, right? Because you live outdoors as much as indoors, you need an extra layer of protection on your iPhone, which will guarantee it remains safe in any circumstances. But this is not the time when you should compromise with any of your values…
{ HOW }
At Allroad Mobile, we want to preserve the perfection of your iPhone design and extend its playground, while making it much stronger, ready for the unpredictable.
{ WHAT }
The end-result is a shockproof case which first does not betray your iPhone X/Xs/Xs Max design and which makes your iPhone usable outdoors thanks to an extensive ecosystem of accessories.


 
 
#1 { PROTECT WITH STYLE }
The low density, high strength, and anti-corrosion properties of Titanium, guarantee an amazing resistance to shocks, drops, and liquids, while keeping your iPhone light enough at any time. Its purity enabled us to create a unique stylish case, without betraying the original iPhone design.






 
 
{ PICK YOUR STYLE }
For launch you are able to choose between 3 styles of Titanium Grade 5 frame colors:

 
#2 { CUSTOMIZE ENDLESSLY }
The iPhone is the world’s #1 smartphone. So you might want to stand out from the crowd and start expressing your own personality into your case. This is why Ti.X comes with many sliders to choose from. You can pick steel for the ultimate urban feel, swap it for wood at the weekend and swap it again for carbon for the next session with your MTB riding buddies.

<h3>3D Edison - Connection</h3>
<p>1. Connect the an HDMI Cable to the INPUT of 3D Edison Console and the OUTPUT of any media source that is equipped with an HDMI Output.</p>
<p>You can connect the 3D Edison via an HDMI cable to ANY Media Sources of the followings:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cable TV or TV Top Box with HDMI Output</li>
<li>DVD Player with HDMI Output</li>
<li>Bluray Player with HDMI Output</li>
<li>Game Consoles – PS3 / PS4 / X-Box / Computer PC / Mac with HDMI Output</li>
</ul>
<p>You can connect the 3D Edison  via an HDMI cable to ANY TV / Monitor of the followings:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ordinary TV Set of Any Sizes with an HDMI INPUT</li>
<li>Hi-End TV Set of Any Sizes with an HDMI INPUT</li>
<li>Ordinary Computer Monitor with an HDMI INPUT</li>
<li>Hi-End Computer Monitor with an HDMI INPUT</li>
</ul>
<p>2. Connect a 2nd HDMI Cable to the OUTPUT of 3D Edison Console and the INPUT of any 2D TV / Monitor / Project / Display.</p>
<p>3. Connect the supplied Power Cord to the 3D Edison Console and the AC Output of the Wall AC Outlet.</p>
<p>*** The 3D Edison Console accepts AC Voltage between 100 – 240VAC 50/60Hz***</p>
<p>(UNIVERSAL VOLTAGE) </p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>3D Edison – Adjustment 6 levels of the “Depth” of 3D</h3>
<p>The 3D Edison Console is equipped with 6 LEVELS of Adjustments in relation to the DEPTH OF FIELDand is separated into 2 Setting of “Inward 3D” and “Outward 3D.” Each of the 2 settings allows 3 different level of adjustments in both the (1) Inward Field Depth &amp;(2) Outward Field Depthvia the remote control - (Strong / Medium / Weak).</p>
<p>3D Depth Adjustments – (1) Inward 3D &amp; (2) Outward 3D Effects</p>
<p>(1) Inward 3D Effect – indicates the 3 Dimensional Field Depth that protrude INSIDE the different layers of 3D moving images / video.</p>
<p>(2) Outward 3D Effect –indicates the 3 Dimensional Field Depth that protrudes OUTWARD LAYERSof of 3D moving images / video outside your TV screen.</p>
<p>An Example:</p>
<p>Just imagine, in the movie when Pinocchio lied to his father and his nose grew longer and longer.</p>
<p>• You can adjust via the Inward 3D Effect of (3 Settings of Strong / Medium / Weak) to set how far INSIDE Pinocchio’s body go into the different layers of the background.</p>
<p>• You can also adjust via the Outward 3D Effects of (3 Settings of Strong / Medium / Weak) to set how far Pinocchio’s nose goes OUTSIDE of the SCREEN!</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>3D Edison – Adjustment of the 3D Active Shutter Glasses</h3>
<p>The 3D Edison Console provides its users with precise calibration of the provided 3D Active Shutter Glasses to your TV or Monitor Screen. Thus, users must calibrate the 3D Edison Console &amp; its accompanying 3D Glasses before the initial use.</p>
<p>By pressing the “ Glasses” button ONCE on the remote control, the user initiates a GUI screen on his/ her TV and enter into the 3D calibration mode.</p>
<p>With the LEFT &amp; RIGHT buttons on remote control, the Correct 3D Calibration can be achieved.</p>
<p>*** ONLY ONE SIDE of Calibration is required***</p>
<p>Adjusting with your LEFT eye closed</p>
<p>• When looking from your RIGHT eye, the contents in the RIGHT or LEFT section of the screen should stay, the 3D Calibration is successful.</p>
<p>OR</p>
<p>Adjusting with your RIGHT eye closed</p>
<p>• When looking from your LEFT eye, the contents in the LEFT or RIGHT section of the screen should stay, the 3D Calibration is successful. </p>
<p>Additional Notes with Calibration</p>
<p>Button Glasses Setting on Remote</p>
<p>1) LV Button: Delays 2 milliseconds (1~9 levels)</p>
<p>2) SL Button: Delays 0.2 milliseconds (1~9 levels)</p>
<p>For TV suggest: LV7 SL4 Inward Week</p>
<p>For  Projector : LV1 SL3 Inward or Outward Strong</p>
<h3>Buttons on Remote and functional</h3>
<p><br/>【<strong>Power Button</strong>】Try to go nearly as possible to 3D Edison to power it on. IR must be within good range and in line of sight. Once you press the power button, the LED light behind 3D Edison goes red.</p>
<p>【<strong>3D Button</strong>】Press it once and it should turn your screen blurry meaning you are in 3D mode. It is converting a 2D image to 3D with a press of this button.</p>
<p>【<strong>Directional Buttons</strong>】These are the directional buttons. You'll be using this for cycling through different settings and hitting ""Ok"" to set the setting etc.</p>
<p>【<strong>OSD Button</strong>】(on-screen display aka menu).Here's where you'll access pretty much all the settings for 3D Edison except for the settings for the glasses.</p>
<p>【<strong>OSD Exit Button</strong>】(aka return/back button)Let's you go to your previous step or exit out of the OSD.</p>
<p>【<strong>Glasses Button</strong>】This open up a setting that's not available in the OSD menu. You get a menu with 2 panel settings: LV and SL. You can adjust both panel LV and SL from 1-9. This is basically where you try to get rid of any ghosting issues.</p>
<p>【<strong>HD Button</strong>】TV be compatible with 3D Edison if it's not compatible with FHD.</p>
<p>【<strong>FHD Button</strong>】Enjoy content in Full HD if your TV has Full HD capability.</p>
<p>【<strong>TV Button</strong>】To change things back to normal.</p>
<p>【<strong>VR Button</strong>】This is for people with Virtual Reality headsets. So, if you want to experience what guessing is limited VR this is for you.</p>
<p>【<strong>3D Depth Buttons</strong>】Left (purely white arrow) and right (black arrow with outer white line) arrows. The left arrow when pressed for the first time is adjusting for the inward setting. The left arrow when pressed during the inward or outward setting just cycles through their settings (but doesn't change to inward or outward.) The right arrow when pressed for the first time is adjusting the outward setting. The right arrow when pressed during the inward or outward setting just cycles through their settings (but doesn't change to inward or outward.) There are three settings to cycle through: weak, medium, and strong.</p>
<p>【<strong>Mute Button</strong>】Pressing it makes no difference.<br/> </p>
<h2>Quick Start Guide</h2>
<p>1. Plug all cables to the appropriate locations on the 3D Edison box. </p>
<ul>
<li>Connector a HDMI input cable to the HDMI input.</li>
<li>Connector a HDMI output cable to the HDMI output.</li>
<li>Connector USB cable to 3D glasses(optional). </li>
<li>Connector the 3D Edison power supply.</li>
</ul>
<p>2. Grab the remote that was included in the packaging. Place the batteries and also, make sure the batteries are alive.<br/><br/>3. Press 【<strong>Power Button</strong>】 on the remote towards 3D Edison to turn on system and check power led states.<br/><br/>4. Press 【<strong>3D Button</strong>】on the remote towards 3D Edison. This will make the screen blurry. What you are doing here is converting a 2D image so that it can be seen in a 3D format.</p>
<p>5. There are two buttons with arrows at the very bottom of remote. They are   【<strong>3D Depth Left Arrow</strong>】 and   【<strong>3D Depth Right Arrow</strong>】.Press once   【<strong>Depth Left Arrow</strong>】 and Keep In world and Week for TV/Monitor(Medium/Strong setting are propose to using for project). </p>
<p>6. Make sure you are in the right scene mode. You can see what scene you are in by going to the OSD menu. 【<strong>OSD</strong>】&gt;【<strong>3D</strong>】&gt;【<strong>2D-3D</strong>】Scene and you have four choices: 【<strong>Movie</strong>】【<strong>Games】【Picture】【Text</strong>】. If you are watching a movie, choose movie. If you are playing a video game, choose Games.※Note: Only stay on【<strong>2D-3D</strong>】mode that you can make this choice. </p>
<p>The others options for SBS、T/B、2D mode:</p>
<p>【<strong>OSD】&gt;【3D】&gt;【3D(SBS)</strong>】Support input SBS format </p>
<p>【<strong>OSD】&gt;【3D】&gt;【3D(T/B)</strong>】Support input Top/Bottom format</p>
<p>【<strong>OSD】&gt;【3D】&gt;【2D</strong>】Back to input 2D format</p>
<p> 7. Grab your 3D glasses. Hit the  【<strong>power button on glasses</strong>】 (small polygon shape button in the middle). You'll see the glasses turn darker. If the glasses stay that way the whole time, it's a success. If the glasses go dark for 4 sec or 6 and stay off, you are unsuccessful. Reason could be you are not in 3D mode. You must be in 3D mode to have the glasses stay on. ※(a)The glasses needs to charge    before you fist use. (b)After full charge, the LED will turn-off automatic.(c)Glasses will stop working once the system left the 3D mode(d)The glasses will automatically stop working after 5 seconds.  </p>
<p>8. Make sure your room is dark (Keep LUX &lt;3) as possible to avoid the annoying constant flickering. Closing the blinds/shades should do a good enough job.</p>
<p>9. Play and pause around a movie (recommend animation or movies that include animation such as Avatar, Cars, Frozen, Toy Story etc.). If you are seeing constant flickering on the screen, try adjusting the Back-light/ Brightness of your TV. Also, disabling motion enhancers and some of the TV settings.</p>
<p>10. Press the 【<strong>Glasses Button</strong>】 on the remote towards 3D Edison. This is where you adjust the 3D image so the 3D image is as clear as possible. ※Right eye see right picture as Left eye see left picture.</p>
<p>11. Notice in the previous step (9.), there are 2 settings you have to adjust: LV and SL. You can adjust both from 1-9. Adjust until you see as minimal ghosting as possible. ※3D Mode recommend LV2 SL3 ,2D to 3D mode recommendLV1 SL3 / LV7 SL4/LV9 SL8 with 【<strong>Movie</strong>】 scene as the selection and a Weak Inward setting.</p>

*** The 3D Edison Console accepts AC Voltage between 100 – 240VAC 50/60Hz***
(UNIVERSAL VOLTAGE) 
 
3D Edison – Adjustment 6 levels of the “Depth” of 3D
The 3D Edison Console is equipped with 6 LEVELS of Adjustments in relation to the DEPTH OF FIELDand is separated into 2 Setting of “Inward 3D” and “Outward 3D.” Each of the 2 settings allows 3 different level of adjustments in both the (1) Inward Field Depth &(2) Outward Field Depthvia the remote control - (Strong / Medium / Weak).
3D Depth Adjustments – (1) Inward 3D & (2) Outward 3D Effects
(1) Inward 3D Effect – indicates the 3 Dimensional Field Depth that protrude INSIDE the different layers of 3D moving images / video.
(2) Outward 3D Effect –indicates the 3 Dimensional Field Depth that protrudes OUTWARD LAYERSof of 3D moving images / video outside your TV screen.
An Example:
Just imagine, in the movie when Pinocchio lied to his father and his nose grew longer and longer.
• You can adjust via the Inward 3D Effect of (3 Settings of Strong / Medium / Weak) to set how far INSIDE Pinocchio’s body go into the different layers of the background.
• You can also adjust via the Outward 3D Effects of (3 Settings of Strong / Medium / Weak) to set how far Pinocchio’s nose goes OUTSIDE of the SCREEN!
 
3D Edison – Adjustment of the 3D Active Shutter Glasses
The 3D Edison Console provides its users with precise calibration of the provided 3D Active Shutter Glasses to your TV or Monitor Screen. Thus, users must calibrate the 3D Edison Console & its accompanying 3D Glasses before the initial use.
By pressing the “ Glasses” button ONCE on the remote control, the user initiates a GUI screen on his/ her TV and enter into the 3D calibration mode.
With the LEFT & RIGHT buttons on remote control, the Correct 3D Calibration can be achieved.
*** ONLY ONE SIDE of Calibration is required***
Adjusting with your LEFT eye closed
• When looking from your RIGHT eye, the contents in the RIGHT or LEFT section of the screen should stay, the 3D Calibration is successful.
OR
Adjusting with your RIGHT eye closed
• When looking from your LEFT eye, the contents in the LEFT or RIGHT section of the screen should stay, the 3D Calibration is successful.

【Power Button】Try to go nearly as possible to 3D Edison to power it on. IR must be within good range and in line of sight. Once you press the power button, the LED light behind 3D Edison goes red.
【3D Button】Press it once and it should turn your screen blurry meaning you are in 3D mode. It is converting a 2D image to 3D with a press of this button.
【Directional Buttons】These are the directional buttons. You'll be using this for cycling through different settings and hitting ""Ok"" to set the setting etc.
【OSD Button】(on-screen display aka menu).Here's where you'll access pretty much all the settings for 3D Edison except for the settings for the glasses.
【OSD Exit Button】(aka return/back button)Let's you go to your previous step or exit out of the OSD.
【Glasses Button】This open up a setting that's not available in the OSD menu. You get a menu with 2 panel settings: LV and SL. You can adjust both panel LV and SL from 1-9. This is basically where you try to get rid of any ghosting issues.
【HD Button】TV be compatible with 3D Edison if it's not compatible with FHD.
【FHD Button】Enjoy content in Full HD if your TV has Full HD capability.
【TV Button】To change things back to normal.
【VR Button】This is for people with Virtual Reality headsets. So, if you want to experience what guessing is limited VR this is for you.
【3D Depth Buttons】Left (purely white arrow) and right (black arrow with outer white line) arrows. The left arrow when pressed for the first time is adjusting for the inward setting. The left arrow when pressed during the inward or outward setting just cycles through their settings (but doesn't change to inward or outward.) The right arrow when pressed for the first time is adjusting the outward setting. The right arrow when pressed during the inward or outward setting just cycles through their settings (but doesn't change to inward or outward.) There are three settings to cycle through: weak, medium, and strong.

If the glasses stay that way the whole time, it's a success. If the glasses go dark for 4 sec or 6 and stay off, you are unsuccessful. Reason could be you are not in 3D mode. You must be in 3D mode to have the glasses stay on. ※(a)The glasses needs to charge    before you fist use. (b)After full charge, the LED will turn-off automatic.(c)Glasses will stop working once the system left the 3D mode(d)The glasses will automatically stop working after 5 seconds.  
8. Make sure your room is dark (Keep LUX <3) as possible to avoid the annoying constant flickering. Closing the blinds/shades should do a good enough job.
9. Play and pause around a movie (recommend animation or movies that include animation such as Avatar, Cars, Frozen, Toy Story etc.). If you are seeing constant flickering on the screen, try adjusting the Back-light/ Brightness of your TV. Also, disabling motion enhancers and some of the TV settings.
10. Press the 【Glasses Button】 on the remote towards 3D Edison. This is where you adjust the 3D image so the 3D image is as clear as possible. ※Right eye see right picture as Left eye see left picture.
11. Notice in the previous step (9.), there are 2 settings you have to adjust: LV and SL. You can adjust both from 1-9. Adjust until you see as minimal ghosting as possible. ※3D Mode recommend LV2 SL3 ,2D to 3D mode recommendLV1 SL3 / LV7 SL4/LV9 SL8 with 【Movie】 scene as the selection and a Weak Inward setting.

We have the prototype and all the companies that produce the single parts of ""Rollset"" ready. There are still a few developments for the cable to be made and a ""Rollset"" of the first pilot series will costs about $ 55 (inclusively all the costs for tooling, assembling, packaging, import and shipping to you), whereas we need at least a few hundred orders to start with the production. We aim to produce a first series of 1,000 pcs and for $ 55 we give our best to send you one.

""Rollset"" is an elegant speakerphone solution and a high strenght flat cable (FFC) can be pulled out from both sides with different length and different speed. The roll-up body is located on the upper chest during use and a microphone is located in the rotating part. It's ready to use in less than a second and after use, ""Rollset"" can be rolled up again and stored without any cable tangle. 

Rollset can be connected to every mobile phone with 3.5mm phone jack: When a call is coming, ""Rollset"" is plugged into the mobile phone and while holding the phone jack with one hand, the earphones are pulled out of the device. ""Rollset"" locks automatically and the spool with micro is in speaking position in less than a second (30cm=12inch from roll-up body to headphones and 70cm=28inch to 3.5mm phone jack). Calls can be even taken (or stopped) thereafter by pressing the button cover of ""Rollset"". After use, the earphones and phone jack are pulled apart (as far as it will go) till the locking mechanism unlocks and while holding the earphones and phone jack under tension the cables roll up from both sides automatically. The phone jack can be plugged out and Rollset can be stored again. 

""Rollset"" eliminates unpleasant cable tangle and mobile phone radiation, fits in every pocket and allows listening to music.

<h3>WHERE WE HAVE BEEN?</h3>
<p><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.45em; color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-weight: normal;"">The idea for Filmojo was seeded when Viv, our CEO, was attending an international film festival. He downloaded the IMDB app. IMDB is the most comprehensive of all film databases. But he soon realized he had to download a different app each time he tried to do something new. And soon he had 9 apps to manage all his movie-related interactions.<br/></span><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.45em; color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-weight: normal;"">Smith, another founding team member, had a similar experience. She is a social network buff. And none of the existing movie apps provided a seamless social integration. And hence, we build Filmojo!<br/></span><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.45em; color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-weight: normal;"">So far, we have gone through 9 design iterations and build 2 stable builds. We haven't launched in the App Store so far, as we believe in going to the market with the very best.</span></p>

She frequently gets invited to private movie screenings. She is a Filmojo Aficionado.WHERE WE ARE?
Over the last 5 months, we have designed and developed many prototypes. Currently, we are ready with the 2nd major build. In this prototype, we have made some major design changes to accommodate added features. We are now working with a few in-house alpha testers to make sure this is a stable and robust build before we go on to build the next prototype.

Our plan now is to recruit a dedicated product manager and a UX expert who can contribute major insights before we go into the final build cycle.



WHERE WE HAVE BEEN?
The idea for Filmojo was seeded when Viv, our CEO, was attending an international film festival. He downloaded the IMDB app. IMDB is the most comprehensive of all film databases. But he soon realized he had to download a different app each time he tried to do something new. And soon he had 9 apps to manage all his movie-related interactions.Smith, another founding team member, had a similar experience. She is a social network buff. And none of the existing movie apps provided a seamless social integration. And hence, we build Filmojo!So far, we have gone through 9 design iterations and build 2 stable builds. We haven't launched in the App Store so far, as we believe in going to the market with the very best.


WE NEED YOU!
We picked Indiegogo for our campaign because we thought this is a great way to get the word out and engage with you - our user. This is how you can be a part of the development story of Filmojo.You contributions will go a long way in enabling us to develop the final build of Filmojo and make it reach our target of 1 million users by end of 2014.

WHAT WE NEED?
We need $19,000 to build and launch Filmojo in the App Store. We will use these funds to ramp-up our core team and also for the initial burst marketing of the app. Here is a breakup of how the money will be spent.

THE IFs & BUTs-  If we are able to meet our goal, Filmojo will be launched on the App Store as per schedule.-  If we are not able to meet our goal, we will still go as per plan and Filmojo will still be launched. But we might have to cut costs a little and postpone the launch date. And our target of reaching 1 million users by end of 2014 will become a little bit more difficult.-  If we surpass our goal by at least 30%, we will be able to launch Filmojo for Android as well along with the Apple App Store. So, do contribute generously!

All device connectors, buttons and holes are rubberized in order to totally prevent moisture seeping into the unit. The touchscreen is made of shockproof glass. Acceptable device operating temperatures range from -22°F to 140°F. The device panel is securely attached to the entry door with a MultiLock protection system, which is almost impossible to open without a key (smart-phone or fingerprint in our case). The fastener is made from mounting loops, located on the four corners of the body. This allows anyone to attach the device to the door through mounting holes using bolts and nuts or to the wall using dowels. Mounting loops are protected with special locks that restrict access to the bolt heads.</p><p style=""text-indent: 1em; text-align: justify;"">The device consists of two different, integrated parts: the external control panel and internal coordination module. The external control panel is equipped with sensors, camera and microphone, speakers and touchscreen. All main components, including motherboard with CPU and memory, communication ports, 3G, Wi-Fi, FM modules, SIM slot is  taken out to the coordination module. There is a special connector located on the back side of the control panel used to connect to the coordination module. This module is designed to be mounted inside the dwelling. The coordination module features a built-in alarm siren that can be activated on movement detection or electronic seals corruption. This behavior can be configured by device administrator.</p><p style=""margin-bottom: 14px;""><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://vitaphone.tv/igg/hr.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><i>Engineering drawing: items description</i><img alt=""Engineering drawing: items description"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://vitaphone.tv/igg/engineering-labels.png"" src="""" style=""display: block;""/></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><i>Engineering drawing: device moulding</i><img alt=""Engineering drawing: device moulding"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://vitaphone.tv/igg/engineering-drawings.png"" src="""" style=""display: block;""/></p><p style=""text-indent: 1em; text-align: justify;"">Four mounting holes and one cable hole need to be drilled to attach the external panel to the door or wall. The rear (internal) camera is connected to coordination module and installed separately (rear camera is available depending on device build).

Vitaliy lived at that time in Florida and in February, 2014 he came to Brooklyn to visit his mother. I (Igor) was living not far from his mother’s house at that time. Taking this opportunity and in spite of the terrible weather Vitaliy decided to drop by and visit me.</p><p style=""text-indent: 1em; text-align: justify;"">Winter 2013-2014 was among the coldest on record and in those days there was a heavy snowfall in Brooklyn. I was home and delved into my garage (I can’t remember what I was looking for, but it doesn’t matter anyway). Vitaliy rang my doorbell for a long time, since he knew I was home since the light was on in my kitchen.</p><p style=""text-indent: 1em; text-align: justify;"">Vitaliy began to freeze after about 5 minutes of trying to get me to come to the door. He took out his smartphone that flatly refused to work because he was wearing gloves and couldn't properly work his phone. Even after he took his gloves off, he had no luck because it was too cold for his phone's touchscreen to work.</p><p style=""text-indent: 1em; text-align: justify;"">Vitaily then went to a nearby cafe and ordered tea to keep warm.

This time of course I was waiting for him.</p><p style=""text-indent: 1em; text-align: justify;"">During the discussion of the occurred incident Vitaliy suddenly noticed: It would be cool if your entryphone could call directly to your smartphone. That evening we sat and chatted for a while and then Vitaly went home.</p><p style=""text-indent: 1em; text-align: justify;"">The next evening Vitaliy come to me with an USB pendrive and presented a new awesome project to me - <strong style=""color: #36C;"">VITAphone<sup style=""font-variant: small-caps;"">neo</sup></strong>.

A few words about device moulding and mounting.The device body is waterproof and is made of durable stainless steel. All device connectors, buttons and holes are rubberized in order to totally prevent moisture seeping into the unit. The touchscreen is made of shockproof glass. Acceptable device operating temperatures range from -22°F to 140°F. The device panel is securely attached to the entry door with a MultiLock protection system, which is almost impossible to open without a key (smart-phone or fingerprint in our case). The fastener is made from mounting loops, located on the four corners of the body. This allows anyone to attach the device to the door through mounting holes using bolts and nuts or to the wall using dowels. Mounting loops are protected with special locks that restrict access to the bolt heads.The device consists of two different, integrated parts: the external control panel and internal coordination module. The external control panel is equipped with sensors, camera and microphone, speakers and touchscreen. All main components, including motherboard with CPU and memory, communication ports, 3G, Wi-Fi, FM modules, SIM slot is  taken out to the coordination module. There is a special connector located on the back side of the control panel used to connect to the coordination module. This module is designed to be mounted inside the dwelling. The coordination module features a built-in alarm siren that can be activated on movement detection or electronic seals corruption. This behavior can be configured by device administrator.Engineering drawing: items descriptionEngineering drawing: device mouldingFour mounting holes and one cable hole need to be drilled to attach the external panel to the door or wall. The rear (internal) camera is connected to coordination module and installed separately (rear camera is available depending on device build). In that way, a complete system can be installed after drilling nine holes in total: five for the external panel and four for the internal module. The cable length between main panel and coordination module can be up to twenty six feet long.Color range.We have chosen colors based on the ones that are used in the building and the door decoration, so they are not as rich and deep as for example, Apple used for iPhone 5c. Imagine how it would look bright yellow device on the dark brown door.
VITAphoneneo has complex antitheft system.«But this device, mounted right near or directly on my door will surely attract the attention of a thief» - You may think. Don't worry! We have done our best to make theft almost impossible and meaningless. That's because:

VITAphoneneo has an ultra-durable steel body, so any attempts to pry it open with a screwdriver will just not work.
Mounting bolts are protected by special covers with locks, that can be opened by the key. All four mounting loops are protected by the electronic seals.
In case a would-be vandal still managed to cut off the device, it will be completely non-functional without the communication module anyway. There is no sense in stealing the external front panel because it just can't work without the paired communication module.
Our device is equipped with a camera and motion sensor. The remote server video recording service will be immediately automatically activated as soon as a would-be thief approaches the VITAphoneneo.
In case of unauthorized violation of the electronic seal on any of the mounting bolts, an alarm will sound and your own personalized recorded message will be played (e. g., «MOVE AWAY FROM THE DOOR AND LEAVE! THE POLICE ARE BEING CALLED!») There is a configurable option that can intended to send a notification to the house owner or to make an emergency call to 911.
Clearly, there is no reason in the world for a thief to even try and steal the device.

The VITAphoneneo StoryVITAphoneneo was born in Brooklyn, New York. Vitaliy lived at that time in Florida and in February, 2014 he came to Brooklyn to visit his mother. I (Igor) was living not far from his mother’s house at that time. Taking this opportunity and in spite of the terrible weather Vitaliy decided to drop by and visit me.Winter 2013-2014 was among the coldest on record and in those days there was a heavy snowfall in Brooklyn. I was home and delved into my garage (I can’t remember what I was looking for, but it doesn’t matter anyway). Vitaliy rang my doorbell for a long time, since he knew I was home since the light was on in my kitchen.Vitaliy began to freeze after about 5 minutes of trying to get me to come to the door. He took out his smartphone that flatly refused to work because he was wearing gloves and couldn't properly work his phone. Even after he took his gloves off, he had no luck because it was too cold for his phone's touchscreen to work.Vitaily then went to a nearby cafe and ordered tea to keep warm. After a few minutes, his smartphone warmed and started working again and Vitaliy called me. We talked and after he finished his tea he went to my house again. This time of course I was waiting for him.During the discussion of the occurred incident Vitaliy suddenly noticed: It would be cool if your entryphone could call directly to your smartphone. That evening we sat and chatted for a while and then Vitaly went home.The next evening Vitaliy come to me with an USB pendrive and presented a new awesome project to me - VITAphoneneo. Since then we added new features almost every hour and nothing could stop us until we ended up developing the VITAphoneneo which we are now introducing to you.We spent six months in planning and preparing VITAphoneneo and now we are ready to start device production.
Who Can Benefit from VITAphoneneo?From the beginning VITAphoneneo was just a simple entryphone replacement with an Internet connection that allows anyone to «receive visitors» online using their smartphone.At that time we had no idea how this project will grow, but right now we know that VITAphoneneo is useful literally for absolutely everyone! Now VITAphoneneo is not just a smart cloud intercom - it is a complex security system for your house, your business, your car, bike or boat as well as an interactive vehicle management system and DVR. VITAphoneneo can completely replace an existing visitor management system in your office. VITAphoneneo is an the heart of communication infrastructure that features notification, communication and organizational capabilities for residents of any home or apartment or office building.Imagine: you have an urgent business trip and you are flying out of town. At the same time your mom suddenly decided to drop in for a visit and nobody's there to give her a warm welcome or even let her in. Thanks to VITAphoneneo, this is no longer a problem - you can remotely open the door, add her fingerprint into VITAphone's database or authorize her smartphone to control your device with just a few touches on your smartphone. You can talk with your mom right there from the airplane.And this is just one of dozens of different scenarios. During preparation, planning and development of the system we have discovered hundreds and thousands of similar stories and we continue to discover more and more opportunities to use VITAphoneneo and make life easier.So, if after reading this information you still think that VITAphoneneo is not suitable for you, it is likely that you just yet haven’t realized all the possibilities VITAphoneneo has - they are almost endless.And if you come up with new and unique usage for VITAphoneneo, that makes it even bigger and better - we always happy to hear it and improve our device based on your suggestions!Authors of the best ideas will be rewarded with the free VITAphoneneo device that will be improved based on their ideas.
Why Crowdfunding?During the project preparation and development stages we have repeatedly raised the question about project financing. We considered various options on how to obtain money required to complete the project and start production.After repeated evaluations of all pros and cons of borrowing money, start-up investments from outside investors and our own savings, we realized that we needed something totally different, something new and unique, as all evaluated options had more cons than pros.Now, with our project in its final stage, we can’t think of anything better than crowdfunding to provide the money we need to make our idea a reality. That's because we can get the funds necessary to start production and our backers get new unique device at a substantial discount. In addition, we hope to get new ideas, comments and suggestions from the public. Every user can take a direct part in future VITAphoneneo product development by sharing their ideas and experiences with us.VITAphoneneo has amazing properties. Only one VITAphoneneo device is needed to manage residential or office building, therefore its price for every user can be less than one dollar, because users can organize a collective purchase.
Fulfillment fund.Here we providing approximate funds distribution based on our preliminary assessments.
Project deadlines.
Our team.Our core team consists of only two members despite the stunning size of the project. During different stages of our project we have attracted a huge amount of human resources: hardware engineers, designers, software developers and marketers, but our team left the same.

<p>Cheers, my name is Brad Simpson. I am the creator of the myTIKR
application. With myTIKR, you can access, check and manage your “always-on”
apps with an elegant, customizable single dashboard screen (currently
patent-pending technology). I created myTIKR to solve a few problems I was
having with managing my smartphone application use. To date, there are over 1.5
million applications available for download from Apple iTunes and Google Play.
On average, each smartphone user checks apps over 35 times a day, spending over
30 seconds per app. Whether or not we are ready to accept it, we now live in a
society of “App-Addicted” people controlled by their “Most Used” apps. For me,
having so many apps made my phone (and me) slow and inefficient. </p>
<p>I realized I was wasting literally hours each day simply pulling
my phone from my pocket and switching between each app, one at a time, to see
if there was anything interesting that caught my eye. Not to mention, I felt
like I was running my battery down too quickly, and my ever-growing app
collection was taking up way too much hard drive space on my iPhone.</p>
<p><i>I wanted to create a
new way to review and engage the information of my most-used favorite apps all
at once on my smartphone screen, instead of having to constantly open and close
independent apps such as emails, Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, Newsy, ESPN, and
Nasdaq.  </i></p>
<p>One evening — March 17, 2013 to be exact — I was watching a <i>60 Minutes</i> segment on Twitter cofounder Jack
Dorsey and his thoughts on social media. 
During a commercial I checked my phone’s NASDAQ ticker notification
panel, and something hit me!  I had the
bright idea to use ticker tapes displaying real time data crawling horizontally
for each app, with multiple tapes stacked on top of each other, comprising an
integrated and comprehensive full-screen matrix snapshot of the user’s most
used apps.  The user glances down at his
phone and sees all desired app content moving slowly in real-time across the
screen, and then taps a finger on the scrolling graphic or text hyperlink icon
to view the full-sized native content. Once finished with viewing that
particular content, one swipe takes the user back to the scrolling app matrix
dashboard.  </p>

<p>I need your help because I’m just a guy with an idea and I am
not a programmer. Everyone has great ideas in this world. Those of us that are
fortunate enough to have the ability to execute are the lucky ones. I have a
satellite defense software background and have brought in a number of my former
colleagues, but I’m not the guy that can sit and program my idea. I need your
help with funding so I can hire the right people to work with me and build this
app. Over the past 260 days or so, I’ve assembled an incredible team of people
that know me on a personal level and help out in every way they can. Every one
of them has jumped on board to help because they believe in the product enough
to put their skin in the game. I have 7 friends that have also invested money
in the project simply because they believe in it. Please help us realize

the CEO of a company in Barcelona called Golden Gekko. Golden Gekko is one of
the world’s largest and prolific application development companies around. We
have already worked through the Pre-Development of myTIKR to the point the
wireframe is complete and we have already started the formal development of the
first Feature Complete Version of the product. I’ve spent to date, over $60,000
of my own money as well as a few investments by friends and family. To complete
the formal development and move to the Apple and Google Play stores, we need a
total of nearly $200K. On this ASK, I am only raising $95K. This amount will
get our expenses paid up to the release of the application at the Mobile World
Congress trade show in Barcelona in February 2014. At that point, we hope to
have gained enough traction that our revenue opportunities will take over to
cover the remaining expenses. I’ve worked very hard at building a model that is
self-sufficient with revenue streams on day one. While we need revenue to stay
afloat, our main goal and purpose is to satisfy the pain points of “Constant

</b></p><p><b>I envision future applications of the myTIKR concept of streaming data.  
One cool example of
how the business could scale to an enterprise model is through serving the
global sports and events verticals, naturally including ideas surrounding the
amazing world of NASCAR.  What we're working towards for the enterprise

Imagine if race
teams, vendors and track owners could stream live content, offers, flash sales
to fans on race day, directly to their phone.  Think of a dedicated to
stream/channel serving that track, vendors, racing teams, and all the fans
attending.  When we say that track, we mean that track!  As soon as a
fan walks into the track/venue the application lights up the fans mytikr
TIKRTRAK and welcomes them to the ""Sears Point geoTIKR"" for that
event.  Fans are instantly notified of other friends that are there, they
can engage with each other in a number of cool ways (like buying each other a
soda or hotdog), vendors can pitch specials on food or merchandise, race teams
can push stats or promote drivers, and third party marketers can geo-target
content, offers, deals, anything specific to that track, it's vendors, and
those exact fans.  All of this done in real-time.  We are currently
already cultivating business deals with folks at the national/professional
level of sports.  myTIKR even scales to a smaller retail stores ability to
market their products directly to their customers on a daily basis. It's all
really cool technology that's time has come. See the new splash screen graphics

helps manage all your favorite smartphone apps in one place with one swipe of
your finger, with a cool, first-to-market patent pending stacked ticker-tape user interface.""I hope you liked the video……….:)              
Cheers, my name is Brad Simpson. I am the creator of the myTIKR
application. With myTIKR, you can access, check and manage your “always-on”
apps with an elegant, customizable single dashboard screen (currently
patent-pending technology). I created myTIKR to solve a few problems I was
having with managing my smartphone application use. To date, there are over 1.5
million applications available for download from Apple iTunes and Google Play.
On average, each smartphone user checks apps over 35 times a day, spending over
30 seconds per app. Whether or not we are ready to accept it, we now live in a
society of “App-Addicted” people controlled by their “Most Used” apps. For me,
having so many apps made my phone (and me) slow and inefficient. 
I realized I was wasting literally hours each day simply pulling
my phone from my pocket and switching between each app, one at a time, to see
if there was anything interesting that caught my eye. Not to mention, I felt
like I was running my battery down too quickly, and my ever-growing app
collection was taking up way too much hard drive space on my iPhone.
I wanted to create a
new way to review and engage the information of my most-used favorite apps all
at once on my smartphone screen, instead of having to constantly open and close
independent apps such as emails, Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, Newsy, ESPN, and
Nasdaq.  
One evening — March 17, 2013 to be exact — I was watching a 60 Minutes segment on Twitter cofounder Jack
Dorsey and his thoughts on social media. 
During a commercial I checked my phone’s NASDAQ ticker notification
panel, and something hit me!  I had the
bright idea to use ticker tapes displaying real time data crawling horizontally
for each app, with multiple tapes stacked on top of each other, comprising an
integrated and comprehensive full-screen matrix snapshot of the user’s most
used apps.  The user glances down at his
phone and sees all desired app content moving slowly in real-time across the
screen, and then taps a finger on the scrolling graphic or text hyperlink icon
to view the full-sized native content. Once finished with viewing that
particular content, one swipe takes the user back to the scrolling app matrix
dashboard.  
My concept became the
brainchild of myTIKR: to design a smartphone app aggregator that brings all
your social feeds and content streams together in a simple, elegant, and customizable
application across all your digital devices.

The road until today
I started to work-out the basic concept of KeepOnWheels starting October 2013. In January 2014 I've hired a design company to create the logo and the icons which are representing the different car services.
Some time later I've hired a website creator company to program the database and the functions. I did the website's structure and design by myself. Finally KeepOnWheels website went live early August.Need
a BOOST
For every new website the most
difficult challenge is to gain users. The growth of the website can be sustained only if
the critical number of users are reached.
So far I could finance the web
hosting, the website programming, the logo/icon design, and some minor
advertisement campaign by my own. But simply I ran out of money. I've
spent approx. the same amount what I set now for funding goal.
I would like to ask for your support to
reach the funding goal, which I would spend in majority for online
advertisement like Facebook and Google ads. Maybe max. 25% I would spend on
correction/changes on the website according the users/contributors feedback.Stretch goalThe next milestone would be to create a smartphone application for KeepOnWheels. If the funding could reach 11.000 € I could immediately start this step. The app would be available free for every major smartphone OS (iOS, Android, BlackBerry, Windows phone).

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>(I am a single father of a beautiful 7 year old daughter. I had been out of work for 2 years until January this year I make very little money and with no help from her mother I have to count every penny. Last month I dropped my cell phone twice and it cost me $90 to get it fixed the first time and $130 to fix it the second time and that hurt me big time.

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>(Companies that make these products cell phones, mp3's, and the other devices that we carry and use daily, want us to have them repaired. So they make cases that only prevent scratches and pretend they're concerned with keeping our devices protected. They also offer insurance and even that only covers certain situations and parts of the phone. We spend millions annually for keep devices we already paid for. With my case it will be almost impossible to drop your phone unless you want to. We all spend a lot of money on these new devices with the intent of keeping them until we want to upgrade them. The big companies are only interested in keeping us coming back and spending and spending... let's decide that where only going back when we're ready.)</p>

<p>In order for us to continue providing mechanical hands and fingers to those who cannot afford them, we need to have a continous source of funding.</p>
<p>We are in the process of registering as a Non Profit Organisation in South Africa which could take approximately 90 days but Indiegogo seems to be the easiest way for our Contributors to make donations to our project.</p>

<p>Please see our website and facebook page for tons of photo's and stories.</p>
<p><em><strong>Original Story:</strong></em> Robohand was established in 2011 when Richard van As had a woodworking accident and lost 4 fingers on his right hand. He is right handed.</p>
<p>During his very short time in the hospital he decided he would create himself a mechanical finger to replace his lost digits.</p>
<p>After researching prosthetcs it was apparent there was nothing available to replace his lost fingers and companies that were experimenting with finger prosthetics wanted exhorbitent amounts of money.</p>
<p>Richard then began his journey of developing his own finger. It all started in his garage with bits and pieces and many trips to the hardware store.</p>
<p>During his year long struggle and many prototypes later, he engaged with another gentleman in the USA and they collaborated together. They were donated two MakerBot Replicator 2 3D printers to assist with prototyping.</p>
<p>Things took off and soon Richard had finalised his Robofinger and created a mechanical hand. Between SA and the USA the file was scripted and the first Robohand was printed in 3D in SA!</p>
<p>The first hand was fitted to a 5 year old boy Liam who has come leaps and bounds with using his Robohand. This was done for free. Robohand has helped 4 children in total in South Africa with Robohands but we have run out of funding to continue to provide this device for free.</p>
<p>If you follow our Facebook page or our Blog you will be enthralled by the stories of the children that are now able to use BOTH of their hands.</p>
<p>Your funding will supply the necessary materials, like Orthoplastic/Thermoplastic, hardware for putting the hands together (nuts, bolts, bungi cord), rolls of PLA plastic for the 3D printer to print the actual hands, plastidip for the fingers, anodizing materials (like sulphuric acid, desmutting liquid, colourant/dye and distilled water) the time and committment from Rich to create these hands.</p>

And just when you're all cozy and comfy and ready for the ""good part"" the movie stops, restarts, begins buffering, etc. How annoying!!! Or you fire up FaceTime on your iPhone to have a chat with a friend and suddenly the video starts pixelating and the audio begins to break up. Ugh!!!</p><p>The issue more often than not is your wireless home network (Wi-Fi). And it doesn't have to be that way.</p><h3>The Problem</h3><p>Your Wi-Fi is a shared connection. As such the more than six connected devices in the typical American home take a toll on your wireless performance creating congestion especially as the bandwidth needs of any given device continue to escalate with more and more bandwidth intensive content and applications being used at home. Additionally your environment is always changing with devices connecting and disconnecting, interference from other neighboring networks especially in dense environments like apartment buildings, and more and more interfering noise sources in the home from the myriad electrical devices we all have.</p><p>Wireless router companies have tried to help with complicated and highly technical administrative functions, apps, etc but these fall short and face it, how many of us even know what all that technical mumbo jumbo means? And have you ever had to call your service provider for help? Good luck with that ""black hole."" Can't somebody just create a solution that you control and can set and forget with your mobile? </p><h3>The Solution</h3><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/629567/files/20140605215153-Logo_02-0.png?1402030313"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p></p><p>At <a href=""http://www.assia-inc.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">ASSIA, Inc.</a> we've spent the last ten years designing and building cloud based systems that monitor and optimize broadband connections and help service providers deliver the best broadband experience possible to their subscribers. And for the last two years we've been working on what we call <a href=""http://www.cloudcheck.net"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Cloudcheck®</a> which brings this same deep technical knowledge base to consumer Wi-Fi connections. Cloudcheck launched in February 2014 as an internet connectivity diagnostic utility application for iOS and Android devices and we are now ready to introduce an extension to the app we call <i><b>Smartifi</b></i>. Smartifi is a Wi-Fi monitoring and optimization service that uses machine learning and decision algorithms to intelligently monitor and optimize on a dynamic basis all of the physical settings of a Wi-Fi router. Our Cloudcheck ""brain"" monitors your Wi-Fi router from the cloud and based upon learning the specific characteristics of your network, usage patterns, etc makes changes to your wireless router to insure you achieve optimal performance.</p><h4>But Does It Really Work?</h4><p>You betcha. We've spent the last six months working with many of our service providing customers to trial the basic benefits of Smartifi. All told we've trialed the service with three major operators in various parts of the world with about 5,000 subscriber Wi-Fi routers (provided by the service providers) and the summary results of the trials shown below are the improvements Smartifi made to wireless routers that were rated at a 54 Mbps theoretical maximum data rate.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/629590/files/20140605220906-Slide1.png?1402031346"" src="""" style=""""/></p>As you can see from the above there were previously no subscribers that could achieve the practical maximum throughput of &gt; 20 Mbps before Smartifi whereas after Smartifi that number rose to 18% of the subscribers.

<p></p></div>","Sound Familiar?You sit down in front of the TV, turn on your TV/media player, browse Netflix, choose a movie and start streaming. And just when you're all cozy and comfy and ready for the ""good part"" the movie stops, restarts, begins buffering, etc. How annoying!!! Or you fire up FaceTime on your iPhone to have a chat with a friend and suddenly the video starts pixelating and the audio begins to break up. Ugh!!!The issue more often than not is your wireless home network (Wi-Fi). And it doesn't have to be that way.The ProblemYour Wi-Fi is a shared connection. As such the more than six connected devices in the typical American home take a toll on your wireless performance creating congestion especially as the bandwidth needs of any given device continue to escalate with more and more bandwidth intensive content and applications being used at home. Additionally your environment is always changing with devices connecting and disconnecting, interference from other neighboring networks especially in dense environments like apartment buildings, and more and more interfering noise sources in the home from the myriad electrical devices we all have.Wireless router companies have tried to help with complicated and highly technical administrative functions, apps, etc but these fall short and face it, how many of us even know what all that technical mumbo jumbo means? And have you ever had to call your service provider for help? Good luck with that ""black hole."" Can't somebody just create a solution that you control and can set and forget with your mobile? The SolutionAt ASSIA, Inc. we've spent the last ten years designing and building cloud based systems that monitor and optimize broadband connections and help service providers deliver the best broadband experience possible to their subscribers. And for the last two years we've been working on what we call Cloudcheck® which brings this same deep technical knowledge base to consumer Wi-Fi connections. Cloudcheck launched in February 2014 as an internet connectivity diagnostic utility application for iOS and Android devices and we are now ready to introduce an extension to the app we call Smartifi. Smartifi is a Wi-Fi monitoring and optimization service that uses machine learning and decision algorithms to intelligently monitor and optimize on a dynamic basis all of the physical settings of a Wi-Fi router. Our Cloudcheck ""brain"" monitors your Wi-Fi router from the cloud and based upon learning the specific characteristics of your network, usage patterns, etc makes changes to your wireless router to insure you achieve optimal performance.But Does It Really Work?You betcha. We've spent the last six months working with many of our service providing customers to trial the basic benefits of Smartifi. All told we've trialed the service with three major operators in various parts of the world with about 5,000 subscriber Wi-Fi routers (provided by the service providers) and the summary results of the trials shown below are the improvements Smartifi made to wireless routers that were rated at a 54 Mbps theoretical maximum data rate.As you can see from the above there were previously no subscribers that could achieve the practical maximum throughput of > 20 Mbps before Smartifi whereas after Smartifi that number rose to 18% of the subscribers. And the worst case performance of < 3Mbps which effected 17% of the subscribers disappeared entirely after Smartifi was applied.So How Does It Work?It's super easy. Once you've downloaded the Cloudcheck app for either your iOS or Android device we automatically can detect if your Wi-Fi router is Cloudcheck enabled. If the wireless router is enabled you can immediately  opt in to the Smartifi service and from there we can detect all the devices that are connected to the Wi-Fi network and the individual speed the network provides to each device.We then allow you to  choose any device on the network to prioritize over the others. This provide and instantaneous ""boost"" to the performance of the device you most care about. A good example of this might be your connected TV when you want to prioritize your Netflix experience over other devices being used at the same time. Once this is complete we then configure your router settings to optimize for this device and over the next several days begin a process of optimizing the entirety of your network based upon what we learn about your networks behavior. And at any time the device prioritization you initially made can be changed or removed entirely so that all devices on your network are treated equally.At any time you can launch the Cloudcheck app to see exactly what your network performance looks like and the performance history of the devices on your network.Why Do We Need Your Help?In order to bring you this cool service we need to Cloudcheck enable Wi-Fi routers. This means we need to add a tiny amount of software to the WiFi routers operating system program space.

<p>In June 2013 we launched a second round Indiegogo campaign. Our first campaign did not raise the required funding and so we have followed up with a second round.</p>
<p>If you contribute to the campaign you will be helping us get Combimouse into production. Here is the <a href=""http://igg.me/at/combimouse2/x/2873701"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">link</a> to the campaign.</p>
<h3>Campaign Wrap Up</h3>
<p><span>There was a lot of interest in this campaign. The campaign pitch video was viewed over 29,000 times and many websites blogged about the campaign.</span></p>
<p>The campaign has now finished and we received $7,000 of the $20,000 goal.</p>
<p>This means that we have had to to adjust our objectives.</p>
<p>We still expect to deliver the perks we offered.</p>
<p>The main objective is to design and make Pre-Production units and to show everyone that they work as well as we say they do. To do that, we need an independent reputable organization to test the Combimouse Keyboard. This will also ensure all issues are resolved before we go to the manufacturing phase.</p>
<p>Working on an adjusted and limited budget we have found ways to make the Pre-Production units. As you have seen the new right hand Combimouse is representative of what we expect the final product to look like. It is much better than the previous prototype and it is very exciting to see the improvements, especially using a better keyboard and seeing the keyboard mode immobility solution. The next stage is to make the new circuit board to interface to these two new technologies along with the new mouse sensor we are using. We expect to have the new prototype ready by the end of June.</p>
<p>We were quoted $5,000 by the university to evaluate the Combimouse Keyboard, which is currently beyond our budget. As there is a lot of interest in the Combimouse and we think that many organizations would be interested in getting involved with the Combimouse. We are going to investigate alternatives shortly.</p>
<p>We have managed to reduce costs by hand making the prototype and for the evaluation we will use the old left hand unit. We don’t expect the different keyboard technologies to affect the evaluation.</p>
<p>In our campaign we talk about how we will use the funds if the target goal isn’t achieved.</p>
<p>We would like to thank the people who purchased the Perks and look forward to delivering them. </p>

<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>The Combimouse is a Combination Keyboard and Mouse that makes computer input easy and very fast.</p>
<p>Before we go into manufacturing, we need your help to design and make pre-production units, so that we can commission a university to evaluate the Combimouse. Evaluation will confirm that the mouse and keyboard functionality is not compromised compared to conventional devices and that the integrated mouse function is optimised.</p>
<p>We are a small startup company based in Perth Australia.</p>

<div>Using funds contributed during this Indiegogo campaign funds we have made the Pre-Production model shown below. Note that this is not a ""Photoshop virtual model"" as some people have suggested.</div>
<div>It would appear that we won't reach our fund raising goal and so we have changed our objectives which you can read about below. We also discuss this in the latest Update which you can read by clicking the Updates tab above.</div>

<h3>What is the Combimouse?</h3>
<p>The Combimouse is a combination keyboard and mouse. The right part doubles as a keyboard and mouse. When you grip it, it becomes a mouse and specific keys switch to mouse click buttons.</p>
<p>You don't have to move your hand off the keyboard to operate the mouse. You just drop your hand, grip it and move the mouse making Computer usage more efficient and less tiring. This is the main advantage of the Combimouse.</p>
<p>The right part works and feels exactly the same as a regular mouse. Thanks to patent pending technology, the right part doesn't move around during typing.</p>
<p>The Combimouse <a href=""http://www.combimouse.com/How%20works.htm"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">website</a> details how it works. </p>
<p>Below are two photos showing the two ways it can be gripped during mouse mode.</p>
<p>The first one is exactly the same way as gripping a normal mouse. It takes fractionally longer to reach then the second method, but it is more accurate because you wrist is supported on the table.</p>
<p>The time to grip using the second grip mode is virtually zero. Pointing is slighly less accurate than the first method because you wrist isn't supported on the table.</p>
<p>When the unit is touched on the right side by the small finger, a sensor is activated and the unit switches to mouse mode. The keyboard keys then become the click buttons.</p>

<h3>Videos using the Combimouse</h3>
<p>These videos show a video within a video of the two views - screen and Combimouse. It is not possible to show then simulatenously in the same view, as the text entered would not be visible. The videos of the Combimouse have been deliberately blurred as explained previously.</p>
<p>It's best to set the resolution to 720p HD by pressing the gear at the bottom. Also set them to full screen.</p>

<p>We need financial assistance to continue. Thanks to continous R&amp;D work and technology improvements we now have it working well and it is fully manufacturable.</p>
<ul>
<li>The latest version is fully manufacturable (funding is required to confirm some details)</li>
<li>The latest version is is stable during typing - the right part does not move around during keyboard mode</li>
<li>All ergonomic issues have been resolved</li>
<li>Technology has progressed to a point where the Combimouse is now feasible. This includes long battery life, thin wall plastic and light notebook keyboard technology.</li>
</ul><p>The next step is to have the Combimouse evaluated before the expensive manufacturing phase commences.  </p>
<h3>Why is this campaign for the Evaluation phase only?</h3>
<p>It helps investors minimise their risk as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can contribute a small amount in this first Evaluation phase and build up purchase dollars (with a 10% early backer’s bonus earned)</li>
<li>you can then wait for the University to evaluate and report back before committing additional purchase dollars</li>
<li>you now have confidence in the product and you can then add to your purchase dollars by contributing in the second Manufacturing phase which will be a separate Indiegogo campaign.</li>
</ul><p style=""margin-left: 90px;""><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/750938/pictures/original/20130411021038-children7389manypixesl.jpg?1365671441"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h3>What’s in it for you?</h3>
<p>If you are quick enough and claim the limited number early bird perks you will get a Combimouse at a big discount. This is our way of saying thank you for starting to get the ball rolling.</p>
<p>For the other perks you will be placed in the queue to receive a Combimouse. The earlier you make your first contribution, the higher up in the queue you will be.</p>
<p>Contributions to the two Indiegogo Campaign phases (ie. Evaluation and Manufacturing phases) accumulate, with your contribution in the Evaluation phase earning you a 10% bonus and contributions in the Manufacturing phase earning a 5% bonus.</p>
<p>When the Combimouse goes on sale you can purchase a Combimouse using your accumulated contributions. If your contributions are less than the retail price you will need to top up and pay the balance.</p>
<p>If you need to top up, you will need to do so within one month from when you are invited to do so, so that you don’t lose your place in the queue.</p>
<p>We expect the Combimouse to intially sell for under $100 - see the Blog ""<a href=""http://combimouse.com/Blog/?p=121"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">What should the Combimouse sell for</a>?"". </p>
<p><strong>Refunds</strong></p>
<p>Details of refunds for eligible Early Bird specials will be posted soon. These are the people who purchased the Early Bird $110 and Early Bird $190 Perks. We are considering offering $30 and $40 refunds to make up the difference with the later perks.</p>
<h3>How will the funds be used?</h3>
<ol>
<li>Design and build two pre-production units. One will be used by Curtin University for their evaluation. We will design new plastics, circuit boards and flexible membrane circuits and have them manufactured.</li>
<li>Commission Curtin University to evaluate Combimouse. This will be co-ordinated by <a href=""http://healthsciences.curtin.edu.au/teaching/physiotherapy_people.cfm/L.Straker"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Professor Straker</a>. They will evaluate posture, movement and muscle activity variables on a number of users. They will also evaluate the usability compared to a regular keyboard and mouse. Curtin University has quoted to do the evaluation.</li>
<li>Enlist a patent attorney to draw up and lodge a Provisional patent which covers the solution of preventing the right part moving during typing. The patent must be lodged before the Combimouse is shown to anyone. Currently only Ari Zagnoev is aware of the idea.</li>
<li>Commission the manufacturing partner and local mechanical engineers to confirm manufacturability of Combimouse.</li>
<li>Ongoing product development.</li>
<li>Prepare for the Manufacturing phase of Combimouse.</li>
</ol><p>If the campaign is overfunded and the university's results are favorable, we will continue straight into the Manufacturing phase.</p>
<h3>Timeline</h3>
<ul>
<li>First two months - Tasks 1 and 3 above</li>
<li>Next two months - Task 2 above</li>
</ul><p>Tasks 4 and 5 above will be done in parallel with the other tasks.</p>
<p>The subsequent manufacturing phase will take about 6 months.</p>
<h3>Use of funds if campaign goal is not reached</h3>
<p>If the campaign is only partially funded the following tasks in descending order will be done:</p>
<ol>
<li>Curtin University evaluation. This is the main objective.</li>
<li>Design and build two pre-production units. If funding is not available, we will handmake a copy of the existing prototype for Curtin University. This is not ideal as we will have to use an old notebook keyboard. Modern keyboards are much better and will be used on the final Combimouse.</li>
<li>Patent. If funds are not available we will prepare and lodge the patent ourselves without consulting a patent attorney.</li>
<li>Confirm manufacturability.</li>
<li>Prepare for commercialization.</li>
</ol><h3>How can I follow progress</h3>

<p class=""entry-title""> </p></div>","Second Round
In June 2013 we launched a second round Indiegogo campaign. Our first campaign did not raise the required funding and so we have followed up with a second round.
If you contribute to the campaign you will be helping us get Combimouse into production. Here is the link to the campaign.
Campaign Wrap Up
There was a lot of interest in this campaign. The campaign pitch video was viewed over 29,000 times and many websites blogged about the campaign.
The campaign has now finished and we received $7,000 of the $20,000 goal.
This means that we have had to to adjust our objectives.
We still expect to deliver the perks we offered.
The main objective is to design and make Pre-Production units and to show everyone that they work as well as we say they do. To do that, we need an independent reputable organization to test the Combimouse Keyboard. This will also ensure all issues are resolved before we go to the manufacturing phase.
Working on an adjusted and limited budget we have found ways to make the Pre-Production units. As you have seen the new right hand Combimouse is representative of what we expect the final product to look like. It is much better than the previous prototype and it is very exciting to see the improvements, especially using a better keyboard and seeing the keyboard mode immobility solution. The next stage is to make the new circuit board to interface to these two new technologies along with the new mouse sensor we are using. We expect to have the new prototype ready by the end of June.
We were quoted $5,000 by the university to evaluate the Combimouse Keyboard, which is currently beyond our budget. As there is a lot of interest in the Combimouse and we think that many organizations would be interested in getting involved with the Combimouse. We are going to investigate alternatives shortly.
We have managed to reduce costs by hand making the prototype and for the evaluation we will use the old left hand unit. We don’t expect the different keyboard technologies to affect the evaluation.
In our campaign we talk about how we will use the funds if the target goal isn’t achieved.
We would like to thank the people who purchased the Perks and look forward to delivering them.

Overview
The Combimouse is a Combination Keyboard and Mouse that makes computer input easy and very fast.
Before we go into manufacturing, we need your help to design and make pre-production units, so that we can commission a university to evaluate the Combimouse. Evaluation will confirm that the mouse and keyboard functionality is not compromised compared to conventional devices and that the integrated mouse function is optimised.
We are a small startup company based in Perth Australia.
Project Milestones

March 2013 - Prototype ready
Pre-Production Combimouse
Using funds contributed during this Indiegogo campaign funds we have made the Pre-Production model shown below. Note that this is not a ""Photoshop virtual model"" as some people have suggested.
It would appear that we won't reach our fund raising goal and so we have changed our objectives which you can read about below. We also discuss this in the latest Update which you can read by clicking the Updates tab above.
A high resolution photo has been uploaded to the Indiegogo Gallery.

 
What is the Combimouse?
The Combimouse is a combination keyboard and mouse. The right part doubles as a keyboard and mouse. When you grip it, it becomes a mouse and specific keys switch to mouse click buttons.
You don't have to move your hand off the keyboard to operate the mouse. You just drop your hand, grip it and move the mouse making Computer usage more efficient and less tiring. This is the main advantage of the Combimouse.
The right part works and feels exactly the same as a regular mouse. Thanks to patent pending technology, the right part doesn't move around during typing.
The Combimouse website details how it works. 
Below are two photos showing the two ways it can be gripped during mouse mode.
The first one is exactly the same way as gripping a normal mouse. It takes fractionally longer to reach then the second method, but it is more accurate because you wrist is supported on the table.
The time to grip using the second grip mode is virtually zero. Pointing is slighly less accurate than the first method because you wrist isn't supported on the table.
When the unit is touched on the right side by the small finger, a sensor is activated and the unit switches to mouse mode. The keyboard keys then become the click buttons.

Videos using the Combimouse
These videos show a video within a video of the two views - screen and Combimouse. It is not possible to show then simulatenously in the same view, as the text entered would not be visible. The videos of the Combimouse have been deliberately blurred as explained previously.
It's best to set the resolution to 720p HD by pressing the gear at the bottom. Also set them to full screen.

Background
My name is Ari Zagnoev and I am CEO of Combimouse. Combimouse has been my obsession for the last 15 years. Overcoming the technological and ergonomic issues has taken a lot of work. 
We are a startup company with 4 shareholders and 3 team members.
We need financial assistance to continue. Thanks to continous R&D work and technology improvements we now have it working well and it is fully manufacturable.

The latest version is fully manufacturable (funding is required to confirm some details)
The latest version is is stable during typing - the right part does not move around during keyboard mode
All ergonomic issues have been resolved
Technology has progressed to a point where the Combimouse is now feasible. This includes long battery life, thin wall plastic and light notebook keyboard technology.
The next step is to have the Combimouse evaluated before the expensive manufacturing phase commences.  
Why is this campaign for the Evaluation phase only?
It helps investors minimise their risk as follows:

You can contribute a small amount in this first Evaluation phase and build up purchase dollars (with a 10% early backer’s bonus earned)
you can then wait for the University to evaluate and report back before committing additional purchase dollars
you now have confidence in the product and you can then add to your purchase dollars by contributing in the second Manufacturing phase which will be a separate Indiegogo campaign.

What’s in it for you?
If you are quick enough and claim the limited number early bird perks you will get a Combimouse at a big discount. This is our way of saying thank you for starting to get the ball rolling.
For the other perks you will be placed in the queue to receive a Combimouse. The earlier you make your first contribution, the higher up in the queue you will be.
Contributions to the two Indiegogo Campaign phases (ie. Evaluation and Manufacturing phases) accumulate, with your contribution in the Evaluation phase earning you a 10% bonus and contributions in the Manufacturing phase earning a 5% bonus.
When the Combimouse goes on sale you can purchase a Combimouse using your accumulated contributions. If your contributions are less than the retail price you will need to top up and pay the balance.
If you need to top up, you will need to do so within one month from when you are invited to do so, so that you don’t lose your place in the queue.
We expect the Combimouse to intially sell for under $100 - see the Blog ""What should the Combimouse sell for?"". 
Refunds
Details of refunds for eligible Early Bird specials will be posted soon. These are the people who purchased the Early Bird $110 and Early Bird $190 Perks. We are considering offering $30 and $40 refunds to make up the difference with the later perks.
How will the funds be used?

Design and build two pre-production units. One will be used by Curtin University for their evaluation. We will design new plastics, circuit boards and flexible membrane circuits and have them manufactured.
Commission Curtin University to evaluate Combimouse. This will be co-ordinated by Professor Straker. They will evaluate posture, movement and muscle activity variables on a number of users. They will also evaluate the usability compared to a regular keyboard and mouse. Curtin University has quoted to do the evaluation.
Enlist a patent attorney to draw up and lodge a Provisional patent which covers the solution of preventing the right part moving during typing. The patent must be lodged before the Combimouse is shown to anyone. Currently only Ari Zagnoev is aware of the idea.
Commission the manufacturing partner and local mechanical engineers to confirm manufacturability of Combimouse.
Ongoing product development.
Prepare for the Manufacturing phase of Combimouse.
If the campaign is overfunded and the university's results are favorable, we will continue straight into the Manufacturing phase.
Timeline

First two months - Tasks 1 and 3 above
Next two months - Task 2 above
Tasks 4 and 5 above will be done in parallel with the other tasks.
The subsequent manufacturing phase will take about 6 months.
Use of funds if campaign goal is not reached
If the campaign is only partially funded the following tasks in descending order will be done:

Curtin University evaluation. This is the main objective.
Design and build two pre-production units. If funding is not available, we will handmake a copy of the existing prototype for Curtin University. This is not ideal as we will have to use an old notebook keyboard. Modern keyboards are much better and will be used on the final Combimouse.
Patent. If funds are not available we will prepare and lodge the patent ourselves without consulting a patent attorney.
Confirm manufacturability.
Prepare for commercialization.
How can I follow progress
We will regularly update the blog Combimouse Pre-Production Model Status. We will tweet whenever an update is made, so be sure to follow @combimouse.
Frequently Asked Questions
Why contribute?
Without your contribution we can't continue and Combimouse may not come to be.
We are offering very attractive perks for early investors - especially the limited number Early Bird perks.
Why has it taken so long?
Technology is only now available to make it feasible - including thin wall plastics, plastic mold flow analysis software, light weight notebook keyboard technology and ultra low power electronics.
Overcoming design problems has taken time. Especially making it light and mobile as a mouse AND immobile as a keyboard and at the same time making it manufacturable. For details please read the blog Combimouse Design Evolution. The solution of making it immobile as a keyboard was only achieved in early 2013 and will be patented. (Unlike some, we appreciate patents which give us the opportunity to protect 15 years work!).
Why only start with the Evaluation phase and not Full project?
This is to give you, the contributor, confidence before funding the complete project. We have tested it and it works well. In this phase it will be evaluated by a University and you will then have confidence in investing in the full project.
We have phased it with you in mind.
If Wichita State University tested it successfully why wait another 10 years?
The prototype used by them was not manufacturable.
It moved around during typing.

Most cables fail to work because they are damaged close to the connection point: USBGuard protects the cable where it needs it.


Protect your USB cables
 Manufacturers usually decide that it's better to produce a nice looking cable, than a strong one.
That's typically the case of Apple Lightning cables: those cables are pretty nice, but wear out typically in less than six months! At 20$ each, or more, that might turn out to be pretty expensive.


Sure, there are unofficial cables out there, but they stop working after a while or, if MFI cables, are still quite pricey.


Furthermore, original cables are guaranteed to charge at the maximum speed your charger can supply, while unofficial ones might offer slower performances, if not even damage your device!


Why do cables wear out so quickly? Because they have a weak spot. The red part is mechanically stressed most times you use your cable. That's how USBGuard works: it covers this weak point and keeps the cable going straight.
USBGuard is flexible, so it helps the cable bend in a smooth and safe way!   Easy and safe USBGuard is easy to install. You can mount it literally in seconds, and you're ready to go.

    Colorful USBGuard gives your charging cable a touch of personal style, while keeping a sleek and nice design. USBGuard is available in eight different colors.

</div>
<p>Easily broken, unpractical or badly designed power strips/bars/extension sockets ranks as some of the most annoying things that can cause the most hazards domestically. What many people do not realize is that it can become a potentially life-threatening event if the product lacks any quality and safety standards.</p>
<p>Although a few have attempted to differentiate themselves from the traditional designs, many have failed in producing such extensively researched and innovative design like us.</p>
<p>With a <b>Connectros</b> kit, you will notice the <b>simplicity</b> and extreme <b>practicality</b> of the product as it<b> integrates</b> a number of your essential<b> daily</b> components into one.</p>
<p>When you're in an <b>awkward place</b> or situation where you are <b>in need of multiple power</b> outlets, <b>Connectros </b>will no doubt become your <b>saviour!</b></p>
<h1><span style=""font-size: 24px; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 26px;"">What do we mean by a 'Quality' product?</span></h1>
</div>
<p>For us, the definition of <b>Quality </b>means using <b>Premium Materials</b> and putting emphasis on <b>International Safety Standards</b> thus creating a beautifully designed and robust product.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Connectros</b> will be available to a number of countries including the <b>U.S.</b> (<b>UL Certified</b>),<b> U.K</b>. (<b>BS Certified</b>), <b>Australia</b> (<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""><b>SAA Certified</b>) and the <b>EU</b> (<b>VDE Certified</b>) providing you with <b>Unmatched Safety</b> and<b> Quality</b> wherever you are.</span>
</p>
<p>
</p>

<p>With multiple sockets from one outlet, the key is how how much power you will draw from it.

However, <b>unlike the normal conversations</b> that usually ensues like <b>how amazing their product</b> is, <b>how it's going to change the world</b> or how much money they were going to make if it was successful; <b>Andy</b> and <b>Wun </b>took a different <b>turn to ask</b>, what they thought was the <b>million-dollar question</b>. ""<b>Why don't companies spend a bit more on quality materials and components so that the end products for the consumers can be much better?""</b></span><br/></p>
<p>
</p>
<p><b>Andy</b>, being a <b>designer</b> with <b>more than 20 years of experience</b> designing various <b>electrical products</b> throughout his career, <b>saw a gap in the market</b> and said to Wun on a separate occasion <i><b>""I think I'm onto something special….but it's not finished yet,</b> </i>(a typical designer's pun) <b><i>but you can come over and take a look at it to give me a second opinion.""</i></b></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>What they saw <b>when Wun visited Andy's workshop</b>, was the <b>start</b> of an <b>exciting partnership</b> and the <b>birth of Connectros</b>. His <b>product </b>was <b>not merely a concept design</b>, but a <b>groundbreaking product </b>with a <b>prototype ready </b>and <b>waiting</b> to be <b>tweaked</b> and <b>then mass-produced</b>. Wun was taken aback by the beauty of the product and expressed to him how shocked he was. (in a good way of course)<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">   </span></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Andy</b> said to<b> Wun</b>,<b><i> ""I've been working on a quick release mechanism for a power strip/bar/extension for the past few years and I think I've finally perfected it...and yes, I have filed the design for a patent already.""</i></b></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>After <b>analyzing</b> the <b>prototype</b>, <b>more ideas </b>came to mind and they found many <b>ways</b> in which the <b>product </b>could be i<b>mproved. </b>Initially, the <b>Connectros system </b>only <b>featured Interchangeable Multi-Sockets</b> and <b>Extension Chords</b>, but now they have witnessed the <b>Development of a Cross-Junction Connector</b>, a <b>Night Light </b>and <b>USB Charger</b> as well as customizability in terms of color schemes.</p>

<p>We have worked extremely hard to prepare Connectros for mass production; however, we are still faced with several challenges which include sticking to our planned timeline. As we have a great relationship with our tooling makers and suppliers, I believe that this challenge will be made easier, especially as our collaboration with them has already produced many different products in the past.</p>

<p>2. Shipping</p>
<p></p>
<p>Shipping costs will vary depending on the country and their specific location. To reduce the cost of the Connectros system as much as possible and to be fair to our customers, the cost that we are quoted for shipping will be exactly the amount that you will be charged in addition to the cost of the Connectros system. Once the campaign is over, we will send you an email to collect some basic details such as your name and delivery address. Of course, you are free to choose your own option for shipping. However, shipping is another risk which may be out of our control during delivery so it is recommended that we help select the best shipping option for you based on your location. In accordance to your shipping preference, we will charge you the exact costs for the shipment. Please note that we will arrange for shipping only after your payment has been confirmed.</p>

Unique ""Innovative"" Design

Easily broken, unpractical or badly designed power strips/bars/extension sockets ranks as some of the most annoying things that can cause the most hazards domestically. What many people do not realize is that it can become a potentially life-threatening event if the product lacks any quality and safety standards.
Although a few have attempted to differentiate themselves from the traditional designs, many have failed in producing such extensively researched and innovative design like us.
With a Connectros kit, you will notice the simplicity and extreme practicality of the product as it integrates a number of your essential daily components into one.
When you're in an awkward place or situation where you are in need of multiple power outlets, Connectros will no doubt become your saviour!
What do we mean by a 'Quality' product?

For us, the definition of Quality means using Premium Materials and putting emphasis on International Safety Standards thus creating a beautifully designed and robust product.

Connectros will be available to a number of countries including the U.S. (UL Certified), U.K. (BS Certified), Australia (SAA Certified) and the EU (VDE Certified) providing you with Unmatched Safety and Quality wherever you are.



Connectros' unique design has a strong emphasis on safety, currently unmatched by many other chargers or power bar/strips/extension chords available on the market today.






Safety Standards for Plug and Socket type Products



Our product Differs itself from the Majority of power-based products Manufactured in China, which are Mostly Profit-Driven and Poorly Made with practically No Certification. 
We Pride ourselves of producing Premium Product with the Consumers in Mind and Not to Release a potentially Dangerous Product to the Mass Market.


Our Team of Designers with over 20 years of Experience in producing Electrical Goods for the Majority of the Leading Electronics Companies out there, know how many manufacturers cut corners to minimise production costs. This is why we want to become the benchmark of electronic goods safety and provide a product that is customer orientated.

Our Primary Concern is giving our customers the Best Product possible which means that the Quality and Safety will Not be Compromised.



The Connectros designs have complied with the testing standards requirements for UL, SAA/BS/VDE certification. If there are any unforeseen issues, we will make the necessary modifications so that it can pass all the required tests.


This is one of the areas that we excel in, giving us the confidence that Connectros will pass the tests with flying colors and become a huge success.


Our partner for the Testing & Certification will be DEKRA, a very reputable German company with a huge global network.
DEKRA has already evaluated our Connectros system and has given us an optimistic view on the project outcome.


Connectros is very diverse with many of our separate modules serving its own purpose.  As new things come out OR if you like to see a new section/function for Connectros, let us know! It is our long-term strategy, we aim to add more useful additions and functions to our current Connectros lineup.




How Many Connectros Modules can I Connect Together?


With multiple sockets from one outlet, the key is how how much power you will draw from it. For our Connectros it is Rated at 10A, so you can connect as many modules together as you wish, just as long as the power you draw and its use overall is within 10A you are fine. In any case, we have a Power-Circuit Breaker if more than the rated power is used, Connectros, will simply it cut off power for safety.









Our campaign and why it is important for us?

"" Whatever I have done before Connectros has always been done with limitation , no matter how enjoyable the process was. With Connectros, it was a very different story as I was working in a team where we had total control of how the product was designed . For our campaign, we want to see whether Our Beliefs in this Innovative Product can be justified. 
We want to Deliver the Best Product of its kind, in terms of Premium Quality, International Safety and a being bit Special, something not available till now. ""
We want to deliver the best product possible of its kind in terms of Premium Quality, International Standard Safety and a little bit of that special something. Something that hasn't been available on the market until now.""

How Connectros can be an everyday product for You and Others 






How Connectros Came About?
Connectros's story starts with a Classic : Lets Design the Best Product that we have Knowledge about
Two product designers (Andy & Wun) with very contrasting backgrounds met up one day and as designers do, discussed products. However, unlike the normal conversations that usually ensues like how amazing their product is, how it's going to change the world or how much money they were going to make if it was successful; Andy and Wun took a different turn to ask, what they thought was the million-dollar question. ""Why don't companies spend a bit more on quality materials and components so that the end products for the consumers can be much better?""


Andy, being a designer with more than 20 years of experience designing various electrical products throughout his career, saw a gap in the market and said to Wun on a separate occasion ""I think I'm onto something special….but it's not finished yet, (a typical designer's pun) but you can come over and take a look at it to give me a second opinion.""


What they saw when Wun visited Andy's workshop, was the start of an exciting partnership and the birth of Connectros. His product was not merely a concept design, but a groundbreaking product with a prototype ready and waiting to be tweaked and then mass-produced. Wun was taken aback by the beauty of the product and expressed to him how shocked he was. (in a good way of course)   

Andy said to Wun, ""I've been working on a quick release mechanism for a power strip/bar/extension for the past few years and I think I've finally perfected it...and yes, I have filed the design for a patent already.""


After analyzing the prototype, more ideas came to mind and they found many ways in which the product could be improved. Initially, the Connectros system only featured Interchangeable Multi-Sockets and Extension Chords, but now they have witnessed the Development of a Cross-Junction Connector, a Night Light and USB Charger as well as customizability in terms of color schemes.
….More products are being lined up!




So what do we have planned for the Perks?

Here it is :







You as Contributors can make a Bigger Change than you think because Only You can decide whether there is a need for Change in Usability, Quality and Safety Reassurance.There are too many unworthy products on the market with some that are the good, but still cut corners in terms of quality to minimize costs. You, as the general public should make a statement by using a product that says no to compromized safety and cost-cutting. 
By using Connectros as a platform for your everyday power provider, we hope that we can start a movement in making premium quality products for everyone to use. You can make a difference in the way that better quality products are introduced into the market with a strong competative edge in terms of quality and uniqueness. 

Our true goal is to make a product that can honestly be Classified as Premium Quality, more Innovative, Safer by Certification and to provide you (the Pledgers) Live Feedback.








Risks and Challenges



1. Risks

Our partners are fully supportive of the Connectros product, which gives us confidence when facing any obstacles as both parties will work hard to ensure that problems are solved swiftly and smoothly so that our manufacturing risks are minimized thus meeting out deadlines.

2. Shipping

<p>Do you run a bar or restaurant?  When your staff is in the weeds and you see that guests are beginning to get frustrated, send out Drink Runner!  Like Joe’s Crab Shack waiters dancing on tables, Drink Runner will divert your guests’ attention long enough for you to catch up.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>SELL MORE DRINKS</strong></p>
<p>For business owners, automated drink delivery means a more efficient bar and more drink sales.</p>
<p>Less waiting = more drinking = bigger tabs = better tips.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>COMPACT</strong></p>
<p>Since it's only 4"" wide, Drink Runner can operate on a standard bar top without interfering with guests.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>QUICK SET UP</strong></p>
<p>To create a closed-loop course, apply ¾” wide black electrical tape to any available flat surface.  Drink Runner will follow it, indoors or out.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>EASY TO USE</strong></p>
<p>To load and unload drinks, block Drink Runner's path to stop it and remove the obstacle to let it go.  What could be easier?</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>SOFT START / SOFT STOP FEATURE</strong></p>
<p>Drink Runner decelerates smoothly to a complete stop when it detects an obstacle in its path and  accelerates smoothly to full speed once that object has been removed.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>LONG LIFE</strong></p>
<p>Drink Runner’s 6 AA NiMH batteries power it for up to 4 hours per charge and can be recharged up to 1000 times.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>NIGHT VISION</strong></p>
<p>Because it sees in the infrared spectrum, Drink Runner can follow a line and detect obstacles in total darkness.  Perfect for dark clubs, bars and restaurants!</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>TEXAS TOUGH</strong></p>
<p>Drink Runner may look delicate, but it’s built for daily use.  Its impact-resistant polycarbonate shell protects it against accidental falls and spilled drinks.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>FULLY PROGRAMMABLE</strong></p>
<p>Be creative!  Write your own programs using a free Integrated Development Environment (e.g. Atmel Studio 6.0) and install them using an AVR USB Programmer.</p>

<p><strong>ABOUT US</strong></p>
<p>LineBot Inc. is an international group of craftsmen, programmers, and engineers who are on a mission to design and manufacture inexpensive, easy-to-use, durable robots for the service industry. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>WHERE’S THE MONEY GOING?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Tooling</li>
<li>Components</li>
<li>Assembly</li>
<li>Packaging</li>
<li>Shipping</li>
</ul><p> </p>
<p><strong>WHAT'S THE PLAN?</strong></p>
<p>We’ve been working closely with a local injection molding company.  All of our other component suppliers are located in the U.S. and most of them have sufficient parts in inventory to produce 350 units.  Once we reach our goal, we are ready to begin production immediately.  Here are our next steps:</p>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>Activate customer service team and update backers.</li>
<li>Begin tooling and update backers.</li>
<li>Obtain supplies and packaging and update backers.</li>
<li>Stage parts and assembly and update backers.</li>
<li>Generate fulfillment tickets and label and update backers.</li>
<li>Ship rewards and update backers. </li>
</ul><p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>RISKS &amp; CHALLENGES</strong></p>
<p><strong>SUPPLY CHAIN</strong></p>
<p>We have a sufficient inventory of components necessary to assemble three hundred fifty (350) LineBots and can easily acquire more if demand requires it.  However, there are 2 components which may pose a challenge.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>BATTERY TRAYS</strong></p>
<p>Drink Runner requires 6 AA NiMH batteries to function.  Prior to operation, the User inserts them into a plastic battery tray inside Drink Runner.  Unless we place a large order for this component, our supplier can’t guarantee he’ll have more than 350 units in inventory.</p>
<p>In the event we need more battery trays, we’ll either rely on another supplier or install a more commonly available battery pack constructed of 6 AA NiMH batteries wired together and shrink-wrapped into a single bundle.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>INJECTION MOLDS</strong></p>
<p>Having inspected samples manufactured by our injection molding company, we’re satisfied that they produce high quality components.</p>
<p>In the event they produce components which are of substandard quality, we have 2 other firms standing by to produce them for us.  However, this would delay our project by approximately 60 days.</p>

<p><strong>FAQs</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>WHAT SIZE DRINKS DOES IT HOLD?</strong></p>
<p>Drink Runner fits most cans, bottles, and glassware.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>HOW CAN IT CARRY SUCH HEAVY LOADS?</strong></p>
<p><span>Drink Runner makes carrying drinks look easy, but it has 3 unique features which makes this possible:</span></p>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>Our custom swivel caster virtually eliminates all third wheel drag.</li>
<li>Our custom drive motors are geared to deliver lots of low-end torque.</li>
<li>Our perfectly balanced shell and rigid suspension virtually eliminate all roll and pitch.</li>
</ul><p> </p>
<p><strong>HOW CAN IT FUNCTION IN TOTAL DARKNESS?</strong></p>
<p>Drink Runner’s Line Following and Distance Sensors emit infrared light and then detect that light when it’s reflected back from objects around it.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>HOW DO I CHARGE IT?</strong></p>
<p>Our custom international Smart Charger will charge Drink Runner’s 6 AA NiMH batteries in about 4 hours.  Before charging, connect the Smart Charger to an AC wall outlet (90V – 260V).  Then, insert its male barrel connector into the DC barrel jack beneath Drink Runner’s tail.  A Red LED will turn on to indicate that it’s charging.  When fully charged, the Green LED will turn on and it will stop charging automatically.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>HOW DO I PREVENT GUESTS FROM TAKING IT?</strong></p>
<p>We recommend installing a Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) tag in each unit and concealing an RFID Reader and a surveillance camera near each exit.  When a tagged unit leaves your premises, the RFID Reader triggers an alarm and the camera records the event for later prosecution.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>HOW DO I CREATE A LOOPED COURSE?</strong></p>
<p>First, Locate a smooth, flat, light-colored surface. White is preferable, but not required. Then, using ¾” wide black electrical tape, lay down a continuous line which loops back upon itself.    Avoid creating hard right-angle turns.  Finally, make sure the line passes by an area dedicated to loading drinks, such as a kitchen or service bar.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>HOW WIDE SHOULD IT BE?</strong></p>
<p>While Drink Runners are only 4” wide, we recommend that you allow 3"" of clearance on either side of the line.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>CAN YOU HELP ME DESIGN A LOOPED COURSE?</strong></p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>CAN I RUN MULTIPLE DRINK RUNNERS ON THE SAME LOOPED COURSE?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, so long as they are all moving in the same direction.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>WILL A DRINK RUNNER COLLIDE WITH ANOTHER UNIT?</strong></p>
<p>No.  Drink Runner’s Obstacle Avoidance System would stop it before such a collision could occur.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>HOW DO I LOAD AND REMOVE DRINKS?</strong></p>
<p>Each Drink Runner has a Distance Sensor which detects objects up to 10cm away (“Obstacle Avoidance System”).  When you place your hand in its path, Drink Runner will stop and turn on its lights.  Once stopped, you may load or remove a drink.  When you remove your hand, Drink Runner will turn off its lights and continue on its way.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>WHAT HAPPENS IF I SPILL A DRINK ON IT?</strong></p>
<p><span>In the event of an accidental spill, turn off Drink Runner and wipe off the shell.  Apply Isopropyl alcohol to a clean, dry towel and wipe the shell to remove any residual fluids.  Allow to dry.  DO NOT IMMERSE IN WATER.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>HOW WILL GUESTS DISTINGUISH ONE UNIT FROM ANOTHER?</strong></p>
<p>If you give each Drink Runner a unique appearance, guests will be able to identify them from a distance.  Since it’s difficult to discern colors in low light, we recommend you use numbers, letters, or symbols.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>CAN YOU CUSTOMIZE A SET OF DRINK RUNNERS FOR ME?</strong></p>
<p>Yes.  Here are some motifs to choose from:</p>
<p> </p>

</ol></div>","MISSION
LineBot’s mission is to disrupt the service industry by manufacturing inexpensive, easy-to-use, durable robots to run food and drinks to guests.
 
WHAT IS A “RUNNER”?
In restaurant jargon, a “runner” is a specialized type of food server responsible for delivering meals and getting drinks for guests.  In addition to increasing efficiency, they also help to free up the waitperson, so they can focus more on customer service.
 
WHAT IS DRINK RUNNER?
Drink Runner is a line-following service robot that delivers individual drinks in total darkness non-stop for up to 4 hours per charge.  Swarms of them act like a conveyor belt, shuttling drinks along a closed-loop course.
 
WHY GET DRINK RUNNER?
 
3 BUILT-IN PROGRAMS


LINE FOLLOWER - Drink Runner delivers drinks on a looped course, like a conveyor belt.

MAZE SOLVER - Drink Runner delivers drinks from point-to-point.

SPINNER - Drink Runner plays our version of the classic game Spin-the-Bottle. 
 
YOUR PERSONAL BEER BUTLER
Don't miss a second of the game going to the kitchen for a fresh one.   Drink Runner will tirelessly serve you and your friends for up to 4 hours per charge!
 
THE PERFECT ICE-BREAKER
Want an easy way to meet people?  Take Drink Runner to your favorite bar to play Spinner, our version of Spin-the-Bottle.  Everyone will notice you and want to join in!

LoveHub is
a new dating resource app that will help its users manage all aspects of their
dating lives, especially those who are communicating/dating more than one
person at time. The Love Hub app boasts dozens of features that will enable its
users to plan, schedule, and organize their dates. In additional, the app keeps
vital dating statistics, including each date’s pro and cons, the places you’ve
been with them, the amount of time and money spent, and relationship milestones
to name a few. Love Hub is also compatible with existing dating websites and
apps.
Dating these days is hectic, complicated, and requires a
lot of time and effort. The Love Hub app helps make this often difficult task
much, much easier!!! 
  


Features:

    Date Scheduling

       Notifications

       Unique Video & Text Messaging
    Date Suggestions
       Alerts

       Dating Statistics
      Milestone Tracker

       Date Pros & Cons

      Gift Purchasing
...Much much more!








Our Goal
 

Without your support, the production of the LoveHub App
cannot happen. Each contribution goes directly to the app firm tasked with
building this groundbreaking dating tool. Upon the successful completion of
this campaign, development and production of the app will begin immediately.
Our goal is to have the LoveHub App in the marketplace by January 2015. 

  

LoveHub Creators



 ANTHONY McLEMORE





Why did you choose to date online?
When a relationship I was in for 4 ½
years ended, I found myself facing a new and difficult reality. I’m a 30
something year old professional who spends a lot of time at work, and hates
the bar/club scene. Online dating was the only option for meeting a variety of women…quality
women.
What made you create the Love Hub app?
At this point in my life, finding a wife and having a
family is VERY important to me. That's why I approach online dating like job. Like most
people, I’m  communicating with multiple people simultaneously. It quickly becomes
difficult to manage it all, including planning/scheduling dates, keeping
statistics (money spent, pro & cons, etc), keeping reminders, and a whole
array of other things those who are dating must juggle.
How do you think Love Hub will help its users?
I think Love Hub will definitely help people who live busy
lives manage this VERY important aspect of their lives. Because the app also
keeps each individual’s vital dating statistics, the Love Hub app will give its
users much needed perspective about the people they are dating and allow them
to make informed decisions.



 DAVE DOERRE




Why did you choose to date online?
I choose to date online because I work from home and I
have limited exposure to meeting new people.  The club/bar scene is not
where I want to meet ’the one’ so I think most people now feel online dating is
a pretty significant tool when it comes to finding love. 
What made you create the Love Hub app?
If you’re like me, finding a great partner online is
like a job. You’re going to get out of it what you put into it.  I tell
people all the time, why not cast a wide net?  Why not increase the odds
of finding the one by interacting with multiple dating sites instead of just
one.  The problem is the sheer time and headaches it takes to manage such
an endeavor.  We set out to create a solution and that’s why we created
Love Hub. 
How do you think Love Hub will help its users?
People like a single efficient and effective
resource for almost all aspects of their lives both professionally and
personally….so why not your dating life!  We hope to help people harness
the amazing tools of online dating in a a way that increases the chances of
finding that special one, while not going crazy in the process.

<h3>Why is this so important?</h3>
<p>There is a large amount of people in the world who do not identify with the traditional conception of gender, or who don´t express their gender in the same way as others. <b>A gender neutral app like Mcalc is the perfect alternative</b> for people who menstruate and have a hard time using overly feminized apps, or simply, for people who don´t want their tracking app to assume their gender and their sexual orientation. Aside from that, Mcalc helps to<b> promote the inclusion of the LGBTQA community in the app market</b> , joining plenty of other apps that have been supportive from the start.</p>
<p>We have already worked in collaborative projects in the past, our own website, sexmind.com is an example of that, it started out as a simple sexual enciclopedia and it has grown to be a bigger site that offers more services than just a space to publish sex education articles. <b>We hope we can get Mcalc to grow into a better app with the help of the online community.</b><br/></p>
<p>We pay very special attention to our users, we don´t have any external investors and we don´t want to. We think <i><b>you</b></i> are our main investor, so <i><b>your feedback</b></i> is the one that matters most. If you think of any way we can improve our app or if you want to collaborate in any way you can think of, you can contact us at info.sexmind@gmail.com</p>

<p><b>Friye Is Different (Than The Other How-To’s)</b> -<b> </b>We use 21st Century technologies to provide voice activated, ad free, flexible, entertaining, audio instructions one-step-at-a-time, in-your-ear. The other how-to guys are using antiquated schoolbook teaching methodology, shoved into todays technology. Video how-to providers do not give any way to navigate through the steps. None of them are hands-free and none of them are ad-free.

<h3>
<b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">The Friye App</b><br/>
</h3>
<p>This phone/tablet/computer application uses primarily a conversational interface where the user communicates the commands to the application with simple English (or whatever language).  When the application hears the word ""friye"" it evaluates what comes after it for a command.  If the user wants to go to the next step, he will say ""Friye Next"".  Friye also looks for synonyms as well like ""Friye start over"" is the same as ""Friye go back to the beginning"". </p>
<p><b>The Structure of a Friye</b> is generally step by step instructions. At any time, the FriyeCook can make the friye ask a question and depending on the answer, decide on what path a friye might go. For instance: If someone is using a friye to set up a new Blu-ray player, the friye might start by asking if they have an HDMI cable or an RCA Cable.The friye will perform a different set of steps depending on the verbal response.</p>
<p><b>Social Responsibility.</b> At the beginning of each friye there will be positive uplifting message from celebrities and famous figures from around the world. We want to empower people in many ways and this will add to cultural diversity in a creative and on-going way.</p>
<p>Many of our perks contain the “Immortalize Yourself” reward. Like the celebrities, this is your way to have your message heard forever. You record a 3-6 second message saying something positive and uplifting that you would want to say to someone starting a friye; such as: “This is Wen Boley saying, you are creating your reality, make it a good one."" This message will be put into the rotation of messages that will be heard by whomever uses Friye. Your positive inspiration could be heard for generations to come!</p>
<p><b>Are we using AI?</b> Even though the Friye application is conversational, we are not using artificial intelligence. Our proprietary methodology of determining what to ask and how to determine answers is simple, elegant, requires less code to operate, requires less data to be transmitted, and gives the user a more consistent experience.</p>
<p><b>The Audio Component</b> The current prototype requires the user to push a button to speak but when the new version is complete, we plan to have the application listen continuously while the user is engaged with it.</p>
<p><b>The UI</b> is simple and consistent in every friye, so the Friyer (user) knows what to expect every time they begin a step or project.</p>
<p style=""margin-top: 30px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/773457/files/20140807183928-1cd327d12b36444468b8174141f10b0f_large.png?1407461968"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/><p><b>Translation Matrix </b>The Friye app is also tied to a translation matrix that will allow friyes to be created in just about any language and then used in just about any other language. </p>
<p><b>Friyes are Yours and Yours alone.</b>  And we think it is important that you can use the friyes you purchase on any device. Your account uses your name and voice print as your username and password. When you purchase a friye, it’s your forever and cannot be transferred or used by others. Voice print identification is how we give people the fairest access and provide the best security.</p>
<h3><b>The Friye Store</b></h3>
<p>The Friye store will be a business model similar to other content models where the application is free, but the content that plays through the application may or may not cost money. Of course we will have a place where users can browse through Friye categories with many different ways to discover what they can do with the application, but because we are a conversational application, friyes will usually be found through searches. Searching is unique with Friye as it is usually initiated through the conversational command “Friye, How do I” or “Friye, I want to” ... The work is then done on the back end bringing the information to the user by letting them know what is available and how much it costs.</p>
<p></p>
<h3><b>The Friye Maker</b></h3>
<p>The Friye Creation Application makes the friye creation experience as easy as possible without sacrificing the ability to make a complex set of instructions. A FriyeCook has at his disposal, an infinite number of ingredients, steps, questions, answers to those questions, synonyms to the answers, branches the path can go, and so on.  We believe in giving our creators infinite resources to be as complete as possible.</p>

<h3><strong>No Advertising?</strong></h3>
<p>Our CEO, Wen Boley says, ""With Friye, we have the ear of millions. That is an awesome opportunity and a tremendous responsibility."" Our business model is to derive revenue from the sale of content. There are enough ways people can receive advertising information in the world. When it’s time to focus on a project and get something completed, you want to be encouraged, not distracted. </p>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p> </p>
<p>The biggest risk and challenge we have is time. This is an awesome idea whose time has come. Even though our branding is solid and we have an exceptional marketing team, those with deeper pockets could beat us to the punch. By initiating this campaign, we’ve tipped our hand to the world. With a phone/web application, patents and intellectual property can only go so far. We must act quickly and capture the market if we are to become the “Kleenex” of the How-To marketplace.</p>
<p>We have the executive team in place and resources to find all the right people to hire to make this happen quickly, we just need the funding required to pay them appropriately. We fit nicely into the criteria of many tech funds, and have already talked to several funders that are interested in putting the big money in that we will need for the marketing, so we are confident that when we are ready to launch the big money will be there to take us to the world.</p>
<p>There is also a lot of well-established competition in the How-To market and though they have not addressed their responsibility with “New World” eyes like we have, they have done a great job in gathering information. We feel these sites are not competition at all, but future partners who can utilize our tool in concert with their own to offer expanded service to their customers. If we come to them with a generous attitude (which we have in abundance in our company) we will be able to create one big happy How-To family.</p>

sometimes forces us to carry a bulky cargo and a cumbersome cables that are not
comfortable to carry... Moreover, we sometimes carry a backup battery and a
portable memory card, just to be prepared for any trouble...</p>

<h3><b>Easy Fastening
cables</b></h3>
<p>When we designed Conkey, we took into consideration the convenience of opening
and shutting quickly in one swift motion, therefore, we chose a solution of
flat cables that fold in a smooth motion. But that's not all of it, we broke it
down to the tiniest details... It's also very important to us that the cable
lock will be handled easily, so we chose a unique solution of quick and swift
magnetic lock, utilizing a special rear heart neodymium magnet. </p></span></div>

Hi everybody !!!


Result of positive
development, we preceded the prototype schedules so we already
started the final preparation to produce it.
We strongly believe in
Conkey and very determined to make it happened and start producing. 
To Achieve this, we
intend to re-launching the campaign and present the prototype in the coming few
weeks.
In addition we brought
improvements in planning ‘ Conkey’, the cable will be detachable and can be
replaced more colors.
To thank the contributors
who contribute in this stage of the campaign, they will be given a gift of more
cable set color of their choice.


My
name is Yud, I'm the founder of Conkey. I am more than believe that Conkey is the
next thing in smartPhone charger. I invested a lot of time and efforts on
Conkey, and I am motivated to bring Conkey to mass production and make it
available for all.

Thank

What is ?
Conkey is a cool and smallest wall
charger that has everything you need to charge your device and to save data - anytime and
anywhere.
Conkey has a folding power plug,
Internal Li-ion Backup battery (300mAh), built-in cables for charging and data transferring and also internal SD card.
All this in a very compact and smart
design that can be attached to your keychain.




Conkey Built-in features

 * Conkey will be available in Rounded / Flat / Square pins.
  Countries compatibility list  





Why  


Today, the notion that we might get stuck without a battery
sometimes forces us to carry a bulky cargo and a cumbersome cables that are not
comfortable to carry... Moreover, we sometimes carry a backup battery and a
portable memory card, just to be prepared for any trouble...
All these products provide a partial solution only, both in
terms of functionality and size and mobility comfort. 
But not anymore!! All you need from now on is Conkey - a
smart and compact packaging that contains everything.
All this in a very compact and smart design that can be
attached to your keychain.









  So small 


Conkey size is less then car remote. 

Conkey is to be with, and feel without… It doesn't only contain everything, it's also so small that you can hook it to your keychain and have it with you every day, everywhere…












These are the colors we had in mind. If you have any advice and idea, we will be more than happy to hear from you.
* At the end of our campaign, we will contact you about your preferred color.


Compact and Unique design


Although Conkey is so small, it contains all the solutions
of charging and saving data wherever you go. 
A Wall charger, a cable of charging and data, a backup
battery and even a portable memory card. All this in one product that is
smaller than a car's remote control.
Conkey has a unique design of easily folding elements for
maximum comfort.

Conkey
is to be with, and feel without......






Data Cable 





Backup battery 



Charging Cable




Easy Fastening
cables
When we designed Conkey, we took into consideration the convenience of opening
and shutting quickly in one swift motion, therefore, we chose a solution of
flat cables that fold in a smooth motion. But that's not all of it, we broke it
down to the tiniest details... It's also very important to us that the cable
lock will be handled easily, so we chose a unique solution of quick and swift
magnetic lock, utilizing a special rear heart neodymium magnet. 











Features






Which device Conkey supports?
Conkey is compatible with most of the devices that
are in the market. It comes in two versions:

Lightning connector:
  Used in the new generation of iPad ,iPod , iPhone
with                                                          lightening connector. Starting from models:  iPhone5, the                                                    fifth-generation iPod
touch, the seventh-generation iPod                                                      nano, the fourth-generation iPad,  iPad mini                                                                               and up
                                         Lightning compatibility list
microUsb :                        Used in the most common smartphone and tablets in the                                                      market. Used in
brands like Samsung, Lg, Htc , Sony ,                                                          Motorola etc.
                                             MicroUsb phones compatibility list 

With Conkey you will never
run out of  battery again!,  Today
you can find a USB port or Electrical outlet anywhere.
In any case! You have your backup battery.

Status of the project & next stage
You will be the first to receive Conkey at a price
significantly lower than the future retail price. We hope that you will like
Conkey and we will stand by to answer your questions and will be happy to hear
your suggestions. 




* we are very optimistic that we meet this time table.

<p>NOT ONLY DO WE NOT NEED THIS MONEY, WE ENCOURAGE YOU TO NOT DONATE UNLESS YOU ARE SURE! We do not need this money. there is enough money in the kitty to keep us running for months. we have recieved bad press recently for making money from this, what people dont understand is that we have touched none of it. we pay the admins, and run the cost of the server, and the rest goes to a kitty we will use when donations stop! Whether you believe that or not is your choice, but thats what happens :) </p>
<p>Currently there is enough money in the kitty to last us, if the donations STOP NOW, another: 5 months.<br/><br/>AFTER DONATING, PLEASE LEAVE YOUR INGAME NAME AND PREFERRED GUN IF APPLICABLE IN THE COMMENTS TAB!!! WE CAN NOT PUT GUNS OR ANY OTHER ITEMS IN BACKPACKS!<br/><br/></p>
<p>We have been required to introduce a cost to perk changes for two reasons. one, because it takes a fair amount of time to remake a perk, and two, it is easier for us to keep track of who has what, and the extra need to keep records of how many changes have been made etc.</p>
<p><br/>you can NOT spawn with any of the following:<br/><br/>1. items in BAGS<br/><br/>2. repair equipment (tyres, fuel etc)<br/><br/>3. rpgs, satchel charges, grenades or smoke grenades<br/><br/>4. radio<br/><br/>5. bags any larger than Alice size</p>
<p>6. any form of machine gun</p>
<p><br/>IF YOU DONATE, the procedure for spawning with weapons is as such:<br/><br/>step 1; create a new character<br/><br/>step 2; once logged in, log out within 25 minutes of creating the character, and wait at the lobby for 1 minute<br/><br/>step 3; log back in, once logged in, you will have your weapons and will spawn at your vehicle location (if you have that perk)<br/><br/>step 4; if this does not work, repeat. if it still does not work, contact krauterz or mancow ingame or on teamspeak.<br/>step 5; DONATORS CAN NOT CHANGE THEIR PERKS ONCE THE ORIGINAL REQUEST HAS BEEN PROCESSED!<br/><br/>**DONATION PERK RULES**<br/><br/>*1 DO NOT TELL ANYONE THE LOCATION OF VEHICLES!<br/><br/>*2 no deliberate trolling, or exploiting. this includes using vehicles that you have not got the perk access to use<br/><br/>*3 NO SPAWN CAMPING. it is ok to sit in capitals and murder innocents, but give them a change to get out of the city first..<br/><br/>*4 NO WASTING VEHICLES. dont crash one helicopter into 8 others..<br/><br/><br/>*5 TRY NOT TO ADD TOO MANY VEHICLES TO THE GAME! take a chopper to a capital, but HIDE IT WELL. OR imobilize it.<br/><br/>*6 AND FINALLY, DONT DEATHMATCH OR SHOOT OTHERS AT PERK LOCATIONS!!! it takes up to 10 minutes to respawn there each time. please dont do it! DOING IT WILL RESULT IN A ONE DAY BAN, second warning is removal of perks for 2 days, third warning is permenant removal of perks.<br/><br/>*7 WE OFFER FULL REFUNDS FOR DONATIONS FOR ONLY 48 HOURS.

NOT ONLY DO WE NOT NEED THIS MONEY, WE ENCOURAGE YOU TO NOT DONATE UNLESS YOU ARE SURE! We do not need this money. there is enough money in the kitty to keep us running for months. we have recieved bad press recently for making money from this, what people dont understand is that we have touched none of it. we pay the admins, and run the cost of the server, and the rest goes to a kitty we will use when donations stop! Whether you believe that or not is your choice, but thats what happens :) 
Currently there is enough money in the kitty to last us, if the donations STOP NOW, another: 5 months.AFTER DONATING, PLEASE LEAVE YOUR INGAME NAME AND PREFERRED GUN IF APPLICABLE IN THE COMMENTS TAB!!! WE CAN NOT PUT GUNS OR ANY OTHER ITEMS IN BACKPACKS!
We have been required to introduce a cost to perk changes for two reasons. one, because it takes a fair amount of time to remake a perk, and two, it is easier for us to keep track of who has what, and the extra need to keep records of how many changes have been made etc.
you can NOT spawn with any of the following:1. items in BAGS2. repair equipment (tyres, fuel etc)3. rpgs, satchel charges, grenades or smoke grenades4. radio5. bags any larger than Alice size
6. any form of machine gun
IF YOU DONATE, the procedure for spawning with weapons is as such:step 1; create a new characterstep 2; once logged in, log out within 25 minutes of creating the character, and wait at the lobby for 1 minutestep 3; log back in, once logged in, you will have your weapons and will spawn at your vehicle location (if you have that perk)step 4; if this does not work, repeat. if it still does not work, contact krauterz or mancow ingame or on teamspeak.step 5; DONATORS CAN NOT CHANGE THEIR PERKS ONCE THE ORIGINAL REQUEST HAS BEEN PROCESSED!**DONATION PERK RULES***1 DO NOT TELL ANYONE THE LOCATION OF VEHICLES!*2 no deliberate trolling, or exploiting. this includes using vehicles that you have not got the perk access to use*3 NO SPAWN CAMPING. it is ok to sit in capitals and murder innocents, but give them a change to get out of the city first..*4 NO WASTING VEHICLES. dont crash one helicopter into 8 others..*5 TRY NOT TO ADD TOO MANY VEHICLES TO THE GAME! take a chopper to a capital, but HIDE IT WELL. OR imobilize it.*6 AND FINALLY, DONT DEATHMATCH OR SHOOT OTHERS AT PERK LOCATIONS!!! it takes up to 10 minutes to respawn there each time. please dont do it! DOING IT WILL RESULT IN A ONE DAY BAN, second warning is removal of perks for 2 days, third warning is permenant removal of perks.*7 WE OFFER FULL REFUNDS FOR DONATIONS FOR ONLY 48 HOURS. AND ONLY IF PLAYER GIVES A RELIABLE REASON FOR THEIR REFUND REQUEST! THIS IS A DONATION SYSTEM! NOT A PAY TO RECEIVE SYSTEM!**DONATING ACCEPTS THESE RULES.

<b>Why we are doing this...</b><br/>
</h2><p></p>
<p>We were watching an episode of one of our favorite YouTuber (video down below) and he was talking about how Minneapolis Police officers will be wearing body cameras in 2014.  Great idea for safety and evidence collection.  But, what about the rest of the police officers around
the nation and the citizens?</p>
<p>We had an idea! We wanted the device to be rugged like an <b>Action Camera + Video
Display + GPS + 2 Way Talk + Infrared + Internal Memory</b>.  A tall order indeed, especially since it needs to be light weight like an action camera with full HD video and tons of extras.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p><h1>Concept to Working Model Is Now a Reality<br/>
</h1><p><br/></p><p>David I worked many months and long hours to find a manufacturer that combined skill and capability to facilitate our every request to accommodate a working model of our vision.<br/></p><p>We utilized every relationship we have available to us from engineers to designers, testers and your average individual for feedback.<br/></p><p>Finally, with the help of a talented team of individuals, Black Mamba Protection, built a strong and trusting relationship with the manufacturer that will build <b>The Hornet™</b>.  A little over a year into the initial concept, we are very excited and proud to introduce you to <b>The Hornet™!</b></p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/343656/files/20140201165558-Hornet_sample.JPG?1391302558"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><br/><h2><b>The Basics

We were watching an episode of one of our favorite YouTuber (video down below) and he was talking about how Minneapolis Police officers will be wearing body cameras in 2014.  Great idea for safety and evidence collection.  But, what about the rest of the police officers around
the nation and the citizens?
We had an idea! We wanted the device to be rugged like an Action Camera + Video
Display + GPS + 2 Way Talk + Infrared + Internal Memory.  A tall order indeed, especially since it needs to be light weight like an action camera with full HD video and tons of extras.
Concept to Working Model Is Now a Reality
David I worked many months and long hours to find a manufacturer that combined skill and capability to facilitate our every request to accommodate a working model of our vision.We utilized every relationship we have available to us from engineers to designers, testers and your average individual for feedback.Finally, with the help of a talented team of individuals, Black Mamba Protection, built a strong and trusting relationship with the manufacturer that will build The Hornet™.  A little over a year into the initial concept, we are very excited and proud to introduce you to The Hornet™!The Basics
of The Hornet

<p>Most products fail in execution because the engineers/designers fail to realize the technological hurdles they will need to overcome during production. We worked closely with our manufacturing partners.</p>
<p>That's why we made sure we partnered with a manufacturer that understood our most important wants and features.</p>

<h1><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">FAQS</span></h1>
<p><b>What devices are supported? Can it charge anything?</b></p>
<p>Like we stated above, the battery pack can charge any phone plugged into it via USB. In terms of the AC outlet, the small pack can support up to 12000 mAh and the large pack can support up to 18000 mAh max. Anything above the max capacity will trigger a safety mode where your pack will shut down. Recharging will then be required to reuse the battery pack again.</p>
<p><b>How long can this device charge for?</b></p>
<p>It really depends on how much power your devices use. When comparing the 12K to the 18K, the 18K can provide about 50% more charging power than the 12K.<br/></p>

The Perfect Mix
NOTHING compares to the portability and power of ChargeTech. 

Gigantic Powerful Generators - Perfect when the power goes out, but not practical to carry around. 

Portable Lipstick Charger - Only work with your phone, not powerful enough to work with your laptop computer or anything else that requires an electrical outlet. 
ChargeTech, it's the perfect blend of size and power. Available In Two SizesChoose your size: The PPO small (12000 mah) or the PPO large (18000 mah)The large size has 50% more capacity than the small size. It also has an additional two USB ports and battery capacity indicator.
Both units uses AC power for your household appliances, and DC power for your 12V electronics.


Works Internationally


Stretch Goals







We wanted more power, but less bulk. 
Most products fail in execution because the engineers/designers fail to realize the technological hurdles they will need to overcome during production. We worked closely with our manufacturing partners.
That's why we made sure we partnered with a manufacturer that understood our most important wants and features.
We worked with our engineers to design an IC board that combines both the electrical outlet and USB port component. This was the biggest puzzle, a configuration that would work physically as well as aesthetically for the exterior design and overall layout for the lithium ion cells. In the end, we created something amazing.



What Can you Charge?
Or should we say, what can't you charge? Any electrical wall outlet device under 85 watts. 


Check the manufacturer's specifications for more information. If you are using a device with a variable setting, use the lowest for your safety.



Field tests were conducted with different household products under the recommended 85 watts limit. The actual results may vary. 
There are limitations:
The 18,000mAh (large) ChargeTech can power devices up to 85w and the 12,000mAh (small) ChargeTech can power devices up to 65w. It is not possible to use high power demanding electronics. An internal safety fuse will cut the power and shut off your energy pack if done so. 
We embedded this safety feature to protect someone from getting hurt.

</div></div>","It's not news that multimedia technologies provide us with the opportunity to meet people and establish new relations. But how about saving, developing and improving your relationship? Who will help with that? The cheLOVEky app is one of the pioneers in this area. cheLOVEky is a unique relationship management platform which helps bring your relationship to a new level. 

cheLOVEky offers a SET OF USEFUL FEATURES:

Mood Meter - learn how your mood affects your behavior;
Event Tracker - be aware of all the changes in your life
Navigator - this smart option collects and analyzes your statistics; it will let you know what and how to correct if something goes wrong

My notes – a fun way to keep and share your thoughts, ideas and impressions
Tips of the Day - everyday tips on how to make your life happier
And - finally - Interactive Diary - which provides you with your personal step-by-step relationship improving algorithm
Using mobile apps for ""emotional life"" improving is becoming a growing trend all over the world. Last year gifted us with a few apps helping couples to understand each other and this is so good! cheLOVEky hides complicated psychological methodology and can be compared with the medical program for treating psychological problems. We are happy to receive support from practicing psychologists who are ready to use our app for remote supervising and consultations. A unique, interactive app for resolving personal problems. This is really what everybody is looking for!  Do you have a personal problem? Who doesn’t? Have you started to think about a divorce? Feel lonely and unhappy? Is your mom irritated with you? Or have your lovely kids turned into monsters? Relax, now you can do something about it.Just install the app, load your data, describe your problem, follow the easy instructions and great result will come.  Magic? Yeah, magic!

""After 3 years of marriage something went wrong... We started to argue without any reason, he got so distant and somebody told me that he goes to lunch with the same lady every day. At that very moment I was offered to participate in tests of the cheLOVEky program. Well, I had nothing to lose! And it was fun! The program was telling me what I should do today and I was doing things I've never done before! But now we have a second honey-moon and do the ""child"" planning! It really works!""
Anonymous tester





The CheLOVEky app adapts to your particular personal problem and generates a step-by-step solving algorithm. In fact, it consists of a personal set of everyday tasks. And all you need is to do your tasks.




""...This is unbelievable! You spend 15 minutes a day and in about 14 days you start seeing results. Life's changing! It's like putting efforts exactly where they are needed and where they bring the greatest results. Moving on is easy!""
Anonymous tester



THIS FUN AND PRODUCTIVE APP IS A COMBINATION OF: 

A unique step-by-step methodology which is the result of two years work by a team of psychologists. The methodology includes five stages necessary to go through for solving relationship issues. We studied hundreds of scientific sources and managed to build a system able to help every single person in the world. Yes, we are sure about that.


A sophisticated but easy to use software platform dedicated to adapt to user's personal needs, features, conditions and his reaction to the implementation of the tasks. Every user gets a personalized algorithm and a set of tasks.


For maximized effect the program can also be supervised and changed manually in cooperation with our staff.


""In developing the program we were guided by two fundamental principles. First, if you want to change the situation start doing something. And second, when doing something, be sure there will be no harm. And this is all about us. All the tasks and tips of the program are easy, safe, positive, and give guaranteed results. But only for those who are motivated to make their life better and are ready to get off their butts :)""
Nataliia Ch.-Busch, co-founder cheLOVEky




A few weeks with cheLOVEky bring sustainable changes for the whole life.


Better spend those years on a new life :)



""First, I was very skeptical...like what in the world are they thinking about? How can I let some program into my life, how can I believe it's going to change my situation? But after I started I realized that it's me who is changing things.

More so, we had to pay a fortune to buy each and every adapter device. So we developed an AirTag wallet size multifunctional charger.  Rather than carrying around a million impractical dongles, we designed the Tooyn Charger. It has everything we need for our Macs. Whether we’re working or just having fun, the Tooyn Charger has everything we need to bring our laptop to its full potential. Tooyn Charger is more than just a Type-C Charger. Incorporated inside are: a fast data USB port, a fast charging USB 3.0 QC port that will charge any device at lightning speeds. The extra USB-C input, HDMI port and 2 different sized SD/Memory Card slots will ensure your being always connected to your environment. Tooyn Charger also incorporates a built-in wireless charger for your phone and iWatch. No more extra cables! Just rest your phone on Tooyn and get charging!  We used the highest quality components for Tooyn, to guarantee the fastest connectivity and unparalleled upload and download speeds. The new generation quality parts ensure that you receive an industry-leading product. Never again will you be slowed down by outdated technology. The Tooyn Charger was conceptualized with a team of designers. We chose a form and aesthetics that complement your Mac becoming an extension of the laptop itself. Presented in color combinations that suit your personal laptop, there is a Tooyn perfect for you.To perfectly suit your laptop we developed the Tooyn Charger in colors most compelling to the modern laptops. Available in three options: Space Grey, Silver and Rose Gold. Coated in Aluminium and Acrylic glass, the Tooyn Chargers are perfect both in looks and functionality.   The Tooyn Charger Ultra charges your MacBook and all other devices from the wall socket or power bank. The Tooyn Charger Basic is super slim and does not have AC power input and needs an external power source.    For those days when you need most energy, whilst staying unplugged, we have a power bank, especially develop to work with the Tooyn Charger. With 20,000 mAh capacity, the Tooyn power bank will ensure, that you never run out of energy.The Tooyn Power Bank can be used to charge your devices through a wire or wirelessly through the Tooyn Charger Basic and all of those plus your laptop through Tooyn Charger Ultra.The Tooyn Power Bank will be available for pre-order in your post-purchase surveys with 26% off from the retail price. Tooyn is not a concept. We already have the contracts with our suppliers and are simply waiting for the orders to launch the production line.

<p>Each year our devices get smarter, faster and more intelligent. However, better battery technology simply hasn't arrived yet and battery life hasn't kept pace with advances in mobile computing.</p>
<p>Mobile computing promises the world: web access, photos, music and maps, everywhere you go. And it can really deliver - for a while. But poor battery life means you'll probably soon run into problems, with some devices leaving you staring at a useless blank screen well before the end of the day.  <b>And when the phone battery dies, the phone becomes useless.

<b>JUS:</b> A real alternative for everyone who loves to stay connected and truly a remarkable advance in green approaches to powering your iPhone when you need it without the need for cords, chargers and holes in walls.</div><div>
<b>
</b><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1447204511/x2rfrcveygwe8kvedcps.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Limitless Energy! JUS sees to it that you are never without power, harnessing the light around you to power the iPhone that is an indispensable part of your work and play.</p>
<p>Using the latest advances in solar technology, JUS incorporates the most efficient cells available to capture the power and stores it in a 4000/5000 mAh Lithium-Polymer battery to deliver enough power to charge your phone twice. In short, it triples the talk time of you iPhone! That’s 42 hours of talk time! And if you have access to ambient indoor light or sunlight, JUS will never run out of power, ever again.</p>
<h1>Let's Face it, the current battery life span on the iPhone–every phone– is just not enough!!</h1>
<p>Battery life is inadequate for a top-end smartphone, meaning there will certainly be no abatement of the periodic shouts of ‘has anyone got an iPhone charger’ across the office.</p>
<div>
<b>And sadly there's little sign of radical, transformative improvements coming any time soon!</b><p>What if you could use your phone without worrying about your battery life ever again? What if you never have to plug in ever again? What if you never run out of power again?</p>
<p><b>Meet JUS</b>, an iPhone battery case and solar charger that would fundamentally change the way you use your phone by replacing conventional charging with solar solving. <i>""Let's create a cleaner, greener world where everyone has </i>JUS<i> to power their phone.""</i></p>

<p><b>GOALS</b> When we started this project, our goal was to bring a product that solves a big problem, that's cool, durable and useful. We believe JUS is just that! We had a great time working on transforming the concept to reality. We cannot wait to finalise JUS and put it in your hands. All we need now is your help and support to cover the cost of what remains. We are well versed in the challenges involved in delivery, so we hope our experience in delivering products will help us to make sure that your rewards arrive on time and in mint condition.</p>
<p>Our initial goal was the minimum amount needed to cover the cost of the mould and first production run. We have also set a couple of stretch goals, one to create an Apple Watch Stand that would be included in addition to the standard back support and another to <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">replace the Micro USB Port with a USB-Type-C Port or a Lightning Passthrough Port. With the </span>support<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> of some amazing backers, we reached the first stretch goal and we are here to reach the second. If we exceed the stretch goal, it will position us to create additional colours and possibly a case for the iPhone 5S.</span></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">But to make this happen, we need your support. Please help support us on Indiegogo and help us create a cleaner greener environmentally friendly solution where no one has to plug his or her phone or ever be without power again. We thank you for your support and please remember to share this campaign with everyone you know and let's make our world a cleaner, greener and safer place, and never without power.<br/></span></p>
<p><b>TIMING</b> We have prepared for every step to successfully deliver rewards to all of our AWESOME Backers. With working prototypes in hand and we will begin the tooling process and cut the mould. First samples will be approved or sent back for adjustments and once samples are approved, we will move into production followed by packaging and shipping. This entire process will take approximately 13 weeks and JUS will ship to all the backers in February 2016.</p>

<h3>Risks and challenges</h3>
<p>We are ex Apple and Microsoft Engineers and we’ve worked hard over the last year to get JUS to this point and we successfully completed critical milestones. We have been using JUS on our iPhones for nearly 6 months and have not charged our phone by any other means even once and we simply cannot wait to put JUS on your iPhones and into your hands. We also used reputable manufacturers who offer great engineering support and development tools. What remains is completing the manufacturing phase and that’s where our training and experience comes in.</p>
<p>We have successfully launched multiple products into the marketplace including Tago (<a href=""http://www.tagoworld.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.Tagoworld.com</a>), Qube (<a href=""http://www.qubio.us/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.Qubio.us</a>) and Kuddles, so we are confident that manufacturing risk is at a minimum.</p>
<p>Thank you for reading this far - let's make this happen and hope to have you as a Proud Backer and please Share this campaign with everyone you know for JUS and for a Better, Greener, Cleaner World.</p>
<p>We are almost ready to push the green button and start production with our manufacturer. We have done our testing and know what needs to happen to get JUS into your hands.</p>
<p></p>

JUS is a hybrid all-in-one solar-powered rechargeable battery pack and slim case that fits your iPhone 6 , 6 Plus, 6S and the 6S Plus like skin and never runs out of power. Ever!  We also intend to create a stretch goal to offer JUS for the iPhone 5S.

What
if you could use your phone without worrying about your battery life ever
again?

What if you never have to plug in ever again?




Each year our devices get smarter, faster and more intelligent. However, better battery technology simply hasn't arrived yet and battery life hasn't kept pace with advances in mobile computing.
Mobile computing promises the world: web access, photos, music and maps, everywhere you go. And it can really deliver - for a while. But poor battery life means you'll probably soon run into problems, with some devices leaving you staring at a useless blank screen well before the end of the day.  And when the phone battery dies, the phone becomes useless.



Battery life is still one of the most important issues when it comes to our phones. So to conserve energy, experts recommend you


Dim the screen brightness


Keep the screen timeout short


Turn off Bluetooth


Turn off Wi-Fi


Go easy on the location services, and GPS


Don't leave apps running in the background


Don't use vibrate


Turn off this and that, …etc. 


NOT A SMART PHONE ANY MORE. Who Needs This? So Much Work and Not Ideal! So...


JUS: A real alternative for everyone who loves to stay connected and truly a remarkable advance in green approaches to powering your iPhone when you need it without the need for cords, chargers and holes in walls.


Limitless Energy! JUS sees to it that you are never without power, harnessing the light around you to power the iPhone that is an indispensable part of your work and play.
Using the latest advances in solar technology, JUS incorporates the most efficient cells available to capture the power and stores it in a 4000/5000 mAh Lithium-Polymer battery to deliver enough power to charge your phone twice. In short, it triples the talk time of you iPhone! That’s 42 hours of talk time! And if you have access to ambient indoor light or sunlight, JUS will never run out of power, ever again.
Let's Face it, the current battery life span on the iPhone–every phone– is just not enough!!
Battery life is inadequate for a top-end smartphone, meaning there will certainly be no abatement of the periodic shouts of ‘has anyone got an iPhone charger’ across the office.

And sadly there's little sign of radical, transformative improvements coming any time soon!What if you could use your phone without worrying about your battery life ever again? What if you never have to plug in ever again? What if you never run out of power again?
Meet JUS, an iPhone battery case and solar charger that would fundamentally change the way you use your phone by replacing conventional charging with solar solving. ""Let's create a cleaner, greener world where everyone has JUS to power their phone.""



On a full charge, even without access to any light at all, JUS can recharge your iPhone from 0 to 100% twice. In short, it triples the talk time of your iPhone! That’s 42 hours of talk time! And if you have access to outdoor or indoor light-any light–even on cloudy days, JUS will never run out of power, ever again. 



We understand how frustrating it is to carry around all of your smartphone accessories. The ""classic"" tangled cables, power bank, phone charger,...the list is endless. Enough! We also know how frustrating it is to run out of battery power on your phone! 




""If you've ever experienced the horror of reaching into a bag only to find that you've forgotten to bring a charger for your dying phone's battery, or never finding a power outlet then you'll understand why JUS is rather appealing""
Don't Miss that Important Call. A dead battery = Business Hazard.


Always Have Power - Green Power Wherever You Are!


So don’t let your battery bring you down; free yourself from walls and take your phone camping, hiking, to the beach if you like because when your phone is charged, you are ready for anything!



Peace Of Mind that you Always Have Power? Priceless

And knowing that your phone power is environmentally friendly with JUS is an added benefit to be proud of and we certainly hope you think the same way too.
By supporting us on Indiegogo, you will receive the revolutionary ground breaking hybrid, all-in-one solar-powered rechargeable battery pack and slim case, for your choice of iPhone 6, 6S, 6 Plus or 6S Plus and the true frictionless charging dock so you never need to plug your iPhone into anything again!And all at a cost well below suggested retail. JUS is different than any other battery or case on the market because it truly changes the way you use your phone. With other battery cases, your phone actually takes longer to charge and you are always relying on cables, outlets, sockets and adapter. With JUS, your phone use is never interrupted and recharging is a click away. JUS currently supports the iPhone 6, 6Plus, 6S and the 6S Plus and with your help, we want to expand JUS to even more phones, introduce more colours and optional Auxiliary Port. As you can see, we have working prototypes and we have our manufacturing partners all lined up. With our Kickstarter campaign successfully over we are working on our mass production of JUS to get it to all our Backers.So don’t let your battery bring you down;



Free yourself from wallsAnd take your phone camping, hiking...


To the beach if you like

Because when your phone is charged, you are ready for anything!


Installation is as Easy as 1, 2, Done!Installing the case is easy: 1. align your iPhone lightning port to JUS MFi Certified Apple lightning interface on a flat surface like a desk, 2. then plug the interface into phone and push the top of phone into case. That’s it!The super slim case fits your iPhone like skin.Powering your iPhone when you need it without the need for cords, chargers and holes in walls is only 2 seconds away.

Lithium-Polymer battery to deliver enough power to charge your phone twice. ! And if you have access to outdoor or indoor light-any light–even on cloudy days, JUS will never ever run out of power!



JUS Charges and protects your iPhone without the bulk
Features like the camera, headphone mini-jack, and controls are still just as accessible as before and most importantly, JUS looks beautiful, ultra thin and fits your iPhone like skin without adding unnecessary bulk and feels like it is barely there yet built rugged, durable and drop safe to protect your phone.












GOALS When we started this project, our goal was to bring a product that solves a big problem, that's cool, durable and useful. We believe JUS is just that! We had a great time working on transforming the concept to reality. We cannot wait to finalise JUS and put it in your hands. All we need now is your help and support to cover the cost of what remains. We are well versed in the challenges involved in delivery, so we hope our experience in delivering products will help us to make sure that your rewards arrive on time and in mint condition.
Our initial goal was the minimum amount needed to cover the cost of the mould and first production run. We have also set a couple of stretch goals, one to create an Apple Watch Stand that would be included in addition to the standard back support and another to replace the Micro USB Port with a USB-Type-C Port or a Lightning Passthrough Port. With the support of some amazing backers, we reached the first stretch goal and we are here to reach the second. If we exceed the stretch goal, it will position us to create additional colours and possibly a case for the iPhone 5S.
But to make this happen, we need your support. Please help support us on Indiegogo and help us create a cleaner greener environmentally friendly solution where no one has to plug his or her phone or ever be without power again. We thank you for your support and please remember to share this campaign with everyone you know and let's make our world a cleaner, greener and safer place, and never without power.
TIMING We have prepared for every step to successfully deliver rewards to all of our AWESOME Backers. With working prototypes in hand and we will begin the tooling process and cut the mould. First samples will be approved or sent back for adjustments and once samples are approved, we will move into production followed by packaging and shipping. This entire process will take approximately 13 weeks and JUS will ship to all the backers in February 2016.



Risks and challenges
We are ex Apple and Microsoft Engineers and we’ve worked hard over the last year to get JUS to this point and we successfully completed critical milestones. We have been using JUS on our iPhones for nearly 6 months and have not charged our phone by any other means even once and we simply cannot wait to put JUS on your iPhones and into your hands. We also used reputable manufacturers who offer great engineering support and development tools. What remains is completing the manufacturing phase and that’s where our training and experience comes in.
We have successfully launched multiple products into the marketplace including Tago (www.Tagoworld.com), Qube (www.Qubio.us) and Kuddles, so we are confident that manufacturing risk is at a minimum.
Thank you for reading this far - let's make this happen and hope to have you as a Proud Backer and please Share this campaign with everyone you know for JUS and for a Better, Greener, Cleaner World.
We are almost ready to push the green button and start production with our manufacturer. We have done our testing and know what needs to happen to get JUS into your hands.

BACKERS ROCK! Launching a new idea takes time, diligence, and courage. We've got all three but we need to meet our goal to continue our quest. We sincerely appreciate each and every Backer and each and every pledge and we thank you for your support. Many thanks to the Indiegogo Team for providing this platform of opportunity.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>One day I and my co partner woke up and decided that after endless trouble and confidence issues with women, it was time for a change. We all know speaking to women online is much easier than in person, so we began brainstorming ideas on how this could be done in real time anywhere in public! </p>
<p>So then we came up with this app idea - Imagine an app where you can talk to a woman that we may have seen in public, or sitting at a table in a cafe` and break the ice before actually approaching her to conversate in person. Or seeing if she is even interested in us coming over! The use of WIFI/Bluetooth, and the wireless chat and notification function make this possible.</p>
<p>How many times may you have walked past the PERFECT match for you in public and not realised? The apps optional questionaire and preferences for your perfect match will match you with this person, and you will receive a text notification when a perfect match is in the area! you can then view there profile/pictures and about me section and receive a % match then ask where they are to meet up. You can also make your preferences as simple as: Notify me when a female from the ages of 18 - 20 is in the area, check our their profile, and decide whether you would like to chat to them to see where in the area they are!</p>
<p>This is not only a great way to meet people, it will also become viral amoung teens, because of the casual sophistacated layout of the app, its not going to be a typical corney cheesy dating app. Can you imagine kids at highschool all connecting with the app, using the group chat function? Perhaps even in a club, everyones heads will be burried in their phones, trying to find women in their area that they wish to approach in conversation, but break the ice before doing so!</p>
<p><span style=""color: #262626;"">This app will also connect with local business - how? we will be in contact with local social venues on times they would like to organise for a concept we came up with called ""meet spots"". this is where singles, or any social group meet at a venue at a certain time, specified by the venue, to us to update/notify everyone in the local area. When everyone with the app arrives, they are notified of people in the area and % matches. Its a perfect way of single people to meet up and chat, knowing they are all there for the same reason. Being able to break the ice and check if someone is a match before talking, could connect people that may have never been connected otherwise!</span></p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We have been in contact with the APP developers APPSTER. They think our idea is AWESOME, and if done correctly with the right amount of funding and effort could be VIRAL. We have received a quote at an estimation of $60 000 to create the app, and perhaps more for advertising/marketing. APPSTER also market and advertise apps and have had 35 apps in the top 100 apps of all time, and are repped as the best app developer in Australasia. We plan to advertise on facebook at $100 a day, and may advertise on radio down the track.</p>
<p>The perk of investing with us Investor recognition and advertising for your business!</p>
<p>If the entire goal isnt reached, the funds will still go towards developing the app, we may have to go to someone else for development, or get a personal loan from the bank to cover the rest. Thats if the funding comes close in anyway to our target.</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This app will be benificial to the world because its an icebreaker to shy people, and could connect people who otherwise would have never met if it wasnt for the app and give people social meeting spots where they can meet people they may hit it off with. The app will be free which will boost the downloads, money will be made out of advertising and sponsors, and perhaps one day a large company purchasing it!</p>

Between what we like to do and what we like to feel. The practical and the emotional. It is an object which adapts to your needs and reminds you where you come from.Our devices are part of our lives: they help us to communicate, to entertain ourselves, to learn, to work… What lies within them relates to us, to the world we create for ourselves. But what about the exterior? Everything is aseptic and cold; all is pure symmetry and perfection.But that is not us, is it?  Montelouro is here to change that. Here to make your surroundings more natural, more human and relatable. That is why it is handcrafted in ceramic, and its design draws inspiration from nature and reflects the beauty of what is imperfect, what is real.A stand for mobile devices which adapts to all models and that will help you and your family to do everything you love.

<p style=""text-align: center;"">Grape Lab is a design studio which is exploring environmental and social issues to find sustainable solutions from a designers' points of view. We are developing design products and services, holding workshops and exhibitions and providing consulting under the theme of sustainable design. We are focusing on a responsible life cycle of our products, from the manufacturing process to disposal process. We make not only design items, but also a mutually beneficial economic platform, sharing profits with vulnerable people, unable to participate in the economic mainstream.</p>

<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>About Founder</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">I am a designer who runs a sustainable design lab called Grape Lab. Originally, my design background was based in the IT industry, making mobile applications, such as games and messenger services. In spite of the flood of digital gadgets and screens, I was always attracted by analog emotions and materials like paper. After leaving my comfy job to make dream come true, I studied sustainable design in the U.K and now I'm taking a big step for sustainable design.  </p>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Because this is an eco friendly product, we didn't add any chemical coating on the paper.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">So, fluids, such as water, and strong shocks should be avoided. Do not place objects over 3kg on this product. </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">The colors of G.stand on the screen could be a little different with real products. We did our best to take pictures exactly, but this kind things always happen on the online. Please understand about that...</p>

About Founder
I am a designer who runs a sustainable design lab called Grape Lab. Originally, my design background was based in the IT industry, making mobile applications, such as games and messenger services. In spite of the flood of digital gadgets and screens, I was always attracted by analog emotions and materials like paper. After leaving my comfy job to make dream come true, I studied sustainable design in the U.K and now I'm taking a big step for sustainable design.  
 

Risks & Challenges
Because this is an eco friendly product, we didn't add any chemical coating on the paper.
So, fluids, such as water, and strong shocks should be avoided. Do not place objects over 3kg on this product. 
The colors of G.stand on the screen could be a little different with real products. We did our best to take pictures exactly, but this kind things always happen on the online. Please understand about that...",18.0,1,"1 Campaign

<p>Today's new smart phones, iPhone, Android, Droid smart cell phones demand larger batteries and much more power per day compared to phones from just a year ago and this means it takes a lot more power to rapidly recharge your new smart phone. If you want to solar charge your cell phone or iPhone then you need a portable solar charger that is capable of producing enough power to rapidly recharge your phone in good sunny conditions and this is where most solar cellphone chargers fail and fall short since they are under sized and simply do not produce enough power to quickly recharge your USB devices.</p>

<p>The panel we have here is using the highest efficiency solar cells on the market, the same type Mono Crystalline solar cells that are used in the popular glass solar panels you see on the top of large buildings and homes all over the world. The solar cells are 17-18% efficient at turning sunlight into electricity vs. the other folding solar panels that use ThinFilm solar cells that are only 8-9% efficient at turning sunlight into electricity. The higher the efficiency of the solar cell the less surface area it takes to generate 1w of power. Since we are using 17-18% efficient solar cells our portable solar usb cell phone chargers are as small as you can currently make them without using super expensive NASA grade 25%+ efficient solar cells.</p>

<p>Mono Crystalline Solar cells also provide another benefit over Thin Film solar cells which is a much longer life span when it comes to producing the power its rated to produce. Mono Crystalline solar cells are usually rated to produce 85% of their rated output power over a 25 Year time frame which is something you will not see thin film solar cell manufacturers claiming. Bottom line is that our portable solar USB charging panels will keep producing close to their rated 6 watt power output rating for up to 25 years if properly taken care of.</p>

<p><strong>What activities can I use the Phone Silk for?</strong></p>
<p>  We’ve had customers use the silks for a huge range of
 activities, from sports (running, gym workouts, cycling, horses, 
skiing, golf, hiking, mountain biking, etc) to gardening, work, 
cleaning, busy moms with babies…anything where you want secure access to
 your phone while having your hands free.</p>
<p><strong>Which types of phones work with the Phone Silk?</strong></p>
<p>  Any phone that will fit comfortably on your forearm 
is a good fit with the Phone Silk. It also works with most fingerprint 
phones, just slide your finger under the edge of the pocket to activate 
your phone. If you should find that your fingerprint phone doesn’t work 
well with the silk, please return it for a refund.</p>
<p><strong>What size should I order?</strong></p>
<p>To determine the size of your Phone Silk, the measurement is taken around the elbow in inches:<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong> <span>Small:  8"" - 9.5 "" circumference</span><br/> <span><br/> <span><span>Medium:  9.5"" - 11"" circumference</span><br/> <br/> <span>Large: 11"" - 13"" circumference</span><br/> <br/> <span>X large: 13"" - 15"" circumference</span></span></span></strong></p>
<strong>
</strong><p>Sizes are the same for Men &amp; Women. Phone Silks can 
also be worn over your jacket to easily answer your phone, change music,
 use apps and such while enjoying your favorite cooler weather 
activities - just take the measurement with your jacket on.</p>
<p>If you receive your silk and feel it is too tight or loose, 
please remove it and return it within 2 weeks to exchange for a 
different size.</p>
<strong>
</strong><p><b>What if my phone screen doesn’t appear bright enough?</b></p>
<p>  We designed your Phone Silk to last, so the 
pocket was carefully engineered to be sturdy while still retaining as 
much visibility of your phone as possible. Be sure to adjust your phone 
screen to full brightness when using the Phone Silk. Some phone screens 
may be difficult to view in very bright sunlight.</p>
<p><b>How do I wash my Phone Silk?</b></p>

<strong><strong>
</strong></strong></strong><p>  Your Silk can be washed in cold water on gentle cycle, inside out, or hand wash. Drip dry – no dryer.</p>

<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.weezzi.com/images/Crowdfunding/emails/Infographic1.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p></div>","What is Weezzi?
Weezzi idea was born from the need to reach people efficiently, easily, without having to login on multiple websites or send emails from multiple accounts or applications.
Its goal is to make our day-to-day web life easy! Giving you the power to create and efficiently interact with all your contact networks.
Centralizing your contact network and enabling you to reach them at any time wherever they are, Weezzi allows you to target messages to specific contact groups by gender, age and location or other rules so that you can reach the right people in the right time.
Weezzi combines email, social networks, online storage, newsletters system and website all in one-single-place! It's Weezzi - The Web Easy! ;)

All-in-One
With Weezzi you can send messages to any contact or contact groups in whatever network they are and Weezzi will take care of deliver it. Either email, Google+, Facebook, Linkedin, Twitter, Gmail, Yahoo, chats messaging or even SMS.
And it is as simple writing any other message!
Your Files Online
In Weezzi you have a built-in online file system where you can add files, images, videos and sounds having even document versioning so that you can access older versions of those files at any time from anywhere.
This system is also fully integrated with your Weezzi website so that you can reuse your files, images, sounds & videos on your website or share them with your contacts or groups so it can be super easy to manage your site or work in collaboration with your team!
Dynamic Contact Grouping
Weezzi gives you the power to create dynamic contact groups that you configure by gender type, geographic location, age group and much more like last login on your website, last purchase on webstore of X value, purchase of X items, purchase of X value, etc.
And each group is automatically updated without you having to do anything.
Website – Personal or Professional
From simple personal or business websites Weezzi allows you to add modular features to it, like blog, news, photo albums, events, services, product catalogue, etc.
You can have your website and manage it easily with Weezzi!
Ecommerce for everyone
If you have or want to start a new business Weezzi is perfect for you. It allows you to sell online your products and services and even add advanced options such as vouchers, stocks management, product promotions, order management, shipment tracking and many great features!
Newsletters
Creation of good looking newsletters and ability to manage and reporting them effectively is normally a difficult task. In Weezzi this is made easy and simple made because of our unique and awarded CMS system.
Weezzi Content Management System
Every website needs a CMS to support it, however most CMSs are too techy and complex to manage specially when there is multi-language, catalogs, etc.
Weezzi CMS is simple, intuitive and easy to manage and was awarded by the Portuguese Innovation Agency by its easiness of use and friendliness.

<p>The SmartPurse™ answers these problems in an instant: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<em>Have you ever dropped or cracked your phone?</em> Never worry about dropping your phone again! The double layer interior padding decreases the chance of cracking your phone significantly. </li>
<li>
<em>Have you ever scratched your brand new phone’s screen?</em> The plastic pocket protects your phone so you don’t have to worry about scratches from keys or sharp objects. </li>
<li>
<em>Have you been frustrated when you get sand in your headphone jack while trying to listen to music at the beach?</em> The special plastic pocket zips shut to keep out sand, dirt and rain. You can even close it around your headphone cord or charger.</li>
<li>
<em>Have you had to put your phone in rice after dropping it in the toilet or getting it drenched in rain? </em>The plastic pocket repels water so you never have to fear texting in the rain or your phone slipping out of your back pocket into the toilet. Note- it is water-resistant NOT waterproof!</li>
<li>
<em>Have you ever wanted to clean your phone but were worried about damaging it?</em> With the SmartPurse™ you can wipe down the plastic pocket from all the gross germs your phone is covered in daily. Use any wipe or spray on the plastic and your phone will be good as new! </li>
<li>
<em>Have you ever emptied everything out of your purse to find your phone at the bottom?</em> The bold black and white chevron fabric is designed to be eye-catching so can't lose it! It is the perfect size to store in larger totes without it getting buried in the bottom (you can even convert it to a wallet by wrapping the wristlet around the body of the purse as pictured below).

<p><strong>WHAT IS THE STORY BEHIND THE SMARTPURSE</strong><strong>™</strong><strong>? </strong></p>
<p>After ripping apart my old purses and teaching myself how to sew, I finally developed my first prototype of the SmartPurse™. I received compliments wherever I went and realized that I needed to get my purse in the hands of women everywhere! One year later, after hand sewing over 250 purses, I am ready to move forward with manufacturing. With your help I can eliminate the the frustration of keeping smartphones safe for women everywhere.</p>

<h2>
<strong>WITH YOUR SUPPORT I CAN MAKE THE SMARTPURSE</strong><strong>™</strong><strong> IN AMERICA!</strong>
</h2>
<p><strong>WHAT MAKES THE SMARTPURSE</strong><strong>™</strong><strong> SPECIAL?</strong></p>
<p>The SmartPurse™ is patent-pending and unlike any other purse, wallet, or wristlet on the market currently! It is the first wallet/wristlet/purse through which you can actually text, touch, call, listen to music, charge, and connect to bluetooth all while your phone is still stowed. </p>
<div class=""template asset""><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/000/430/660/6762b4d73082c816a787dcfa819bb345_large.gif?1362714157"" src="""" style=""""/></div>

<p><strong>HOW DOES IT WORK?</strong></p>
<p>Touch screen phones work using the electrical field coming out of your body, so direct contact isn't necessary. The plastic I use is a special thickness that allows you to still have full functionality while providing a thick enough layer of protection to prevent scratches and damage. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>WHAT IF I DON’T HAVE AN IPHONE? </strong></p>
<p>No worries! The SmartPurse™ not only fits iPhones, but it also fits Android phones and any other smartphone. If you don’t have a smartphone you can even store your passport, pens, makeup, first aid supplies, and much more! </p>

<p><strong><em>I need your help to move forward with manufacturing a USA MADE PRODUCT! </em></strong><strong><em> Please help spread my message by sharing on Facebook, Twitter, email, and more so I can revolutionize the accessory industry forever. </em></strong></p>
<p>1. First, I will buy fabric in bulk from my supplier (I need to increase the volume of my purchase to decrease the cost) </p>
<p>2. Then I will get my labels custom printed so they can be sewn into each purse (the minimum order for custom labels is very high as well). </p>
<p>3. Next, I will send all the supplies to my manufacturer so they can begin production (I need to place a large order with my manufacturer to reduce production costs and keep the price low for you!). </p>

We also use a special Omni directional Antenna designed for long range. This enables a line of sight Radius Range of more than half a Mile. (about 800 meters)</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>We made an amazing app for BluTracker,with many features...</strong></h3>

<h2><strong><em>FAQ:</em></strong></h2>
<p class=""normal""><strong><em>What is the difference between the US Version and the European version.</em></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It is the same unit. When you set up your unit for the first time, to meet European laws and Certification, selecting Europe as your location will load the EU profile. The US profile transmits a stronger signal than the European one. To meet European CE and ETSI Certification, we had to lower the transmission signal for the European profile. For the US Profile we meet the maximum allowance per FCC Title 47, Section 15.247.</li>
</ul><p class=""normal""><strong><em>How many BluTrackers can 1 Smartphone find?</em></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>We recommend using no more than 20 BluTrackers at the same time.</li>
</ul><p class=""normal""><strong><em>Can multiple phones connect to a BluTracker?</em></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>You can pair a Blutracker to many phones, and even see all the BluTrackers in range on the Radar screen from many phones at the same time, but only one phone can make connect to a BluTracker. (make it Buzz, or create the Virtual Leash at a time)</li>
</ul><p class=""normal""><strong><em>Is the signal with coordinates being transmitted from the BluTracker encrypted?</em></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>BluTracker encrypts the signal, and only a phone that was paired with BluTracker will be able to decode the signal.</li>
</ul><p class=""normal""><strong><em>What to do if my pet is lost, and I can't locate BluTracker on my phone?</em></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Start walking or driving in any direction. The Blutracker app will keep searching for the BluTracker. You only need to pick up the BluTracker signal very briefly to know its exact last known GPS coordinates.  Once that signal is received, it will pinpoint the location on the BluTracker Map view app. With the US Version we have picked up weak signals as far as 1 mile with direct line of sight.</li>
</ul><p class=""normal""><strong><em>How easy is to pair a BluTracker to your smartphone?</em></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>You only need to pair the BluTracker once with your phone and after that it is automatic. To pair the first time launch the BluTracker app, select to add a new device, then the app will prompt you to scan a barcode or enter the Private key belonging to the BluTracker. You are done.</li>
</ul><p class=""normal""><strong> <em>What Smartphones does the BluTracker work with?:</em></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>BluTracker works iPhone 4s, iPhone 5, New Ipad, iPad mini, New iPod touch. It also works on Android devices supporting Bluetooth Low Energy, running Android 4.0 and newer. We have tested it on the Samsung Galaxy S3, and Note 2, and it works great! (Since the support for Bluetooth 4.0 on the Samsung S3 is bad, we wrote the Bluetooth drivers on our own)</li>

<p><strong> </strong></p></div>","Blutracker is an ultra small Bluetooth GPS locator. It has a range of over half a Mile, the battery lasts for over 2 months in between charges, it has a full GPS engine and motion detector. There are absolutely no service fees!



Most pets that are lost, are within a couple of blocks from your home.


Track your kids in large playgrounds, parks or in your neighborhood.


Discover the exact outdoor location of the BluTracker within 10 feet at any time.


Built in motion detector notifies you if your item is moved or missing.

                         -- Meet BlueTracker :                                                 



 
LONG RANGE Bluetooth 4.0
Over half a mile Range (US Version)! How did we achieve such amazing range? We are using in-house custom modified RF amplifiers designed for very long range. We also use a special Omni directional Antenna designed for long range. This enables a line of sight Radius Range of more than half a Mile. (about 800 meters)
 
We made an amazing app for BluTracker,with many features...
The first feature is Maps and Virtual Fence.
 
 
 
 
 
 
Pinpoint the BluTracker easily on a map. On Google Maps you will see yourself as a blue dot and BluTracker as a red dot. You can also draw a circle  to create a Virtual Fence around you. Any time the BluTraker moves outside this Virtual Fence, your phone will alert you.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
This is a great feature if you want to let your dog roam free in the park. If it wanders off, you will be notified. Then find it easily using the locator App.
Best of all, No monthly fees!

But what about indoors?
GPS doesn't work indoors... So we created the Radar feature.

 
 
 
 
The Radar Screen will display BluTracker in a Radar type Screen. Of course, because we don't really know direction, the radar Screen can only be used to approximate the relative distance of the BluTracker to your phone, but not direction. So once you have located on the Radar Screen a BluTracker you would like to find, you start walking in a specific direction, and see if it gets closer or farther.
 



Water Resistant, No- ON/OFF button!

 
 
The battery last for about 2 months with continuous use. That means you can attach it to your Pets collar, and literally forget about it. Or Attach it to a kids sneaker, bag pack etc.
 
 
When the battery is low, it takes about 1 hour to fully charge it!

So many use cases...

 
Get an Alert if someone is moving your bike. 
But, where did you park it? BluTracker will  help you find it too.
 
 
Don't loose your Bike!
 

 
 
 
Know where your workers are. 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 
 
BluTracker has a Motion Detector. Get an alert on your phone, if someone touches your stuff.
 

What about an API? We will release an API for BluTracker soon after launch! You can make your own custom apps for BluTracker.
Our API will support iOS, Android, Mac OS X, and Windows 8.

Preorder your BluTracker now, and get the early bird price.

<p></p>
<p><b>Welcome
to the next evolution in technology.</b> Hi,  my name is Ron, the inventor of the P.O.D. from NYC. First, I'd like to thank you 
for visiting and supporting a solution to an on-going and growing demand which we all are facing. 
I'm sure just like me, every one of you have run out of battery power either on 
your cell phone or other mobile devices and always at the worst possible time, 
(like there ever is a good time to run out of power). Today there are so many new apps and 
mobile devices that we just can’t live without. </p>
<p>The POD was created to manage all your USB mobile devices so that you will never be without power or have to do anything else except take this handy little device with you. Simply plug your USB cable 
into the USB port of the POD and it will turn on automatically. The color band will start glowing around the unit and that’s how you know it is working. Once your 
unit is charged, you simply unplug the USB cable and the glowing power indicator 
will automatically turn off. </p>
<p>The
POD is a fully maintenance free unit, which means you will never have to charge
it for the next <b>10 years</b>. This unit comes with an adjustable mounting
strap that fits all cell phones. With the shape of the POD, it fits
perfectly in the palm of your hand giving you a better more comfortable grip, meaning
less likelihood of dropping, when mounted to your cell phone. The adjustable
strap can also be worn on your wrist, belt loop or  purse strap for your convenience. I added an ultra bright LED
flashlight to the front of the POD so you can just tap the light and it goes
on, when you tap it again it will go off. I added this because we never have a
light when we need it. So enjoy this feature.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1031658/files/20141120033603-10_years.jpg?1416483363"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Additionally the POD also works on the 1st mobile device... </span><b style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">YOUR CAR!</b><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""> That’s right, I said your 
car. The car battery doesn’t die as fast or as often as other power sources do, 
but it does die, so if you ever get stuck, you now can stay in the safety of your 
car and use the POD's Perfect Add-On ""Car-Jumpstart Kit"". Simply attach the 
POD, using the CONNECTING CABLE into the CIGARETTE LIGHTER ADAPTER. The Power Meter will show you when the 
battery is charged. Super simple, Super easy. How cool is that?</span><br/></p>

<p><b>Now Compare: Portable Power Units vs. P.O.D. </b></p>
<p>1) 
They get 2x to 4x
more battery life. </p>
<p>     POD runs
for 10 years.  </p>
<p>2) 
They have another
device to charge. </p>
<p>     POD is

</div></div>","Short Summary 


Welcome
to the next evolution in technology. Hi,  my name is Ron, the inventor of the P.O.D. from NYC. First, I'd like to thank you 
for visiting and supporting a solution to an on-going and growing demand which we all are facing. 
I'm sure just like me, every one of you have run out of battery power either on 
your cell phone or other mobile devices and always at the worst possible time, 
(like there ever is a good time to run out of power). Today there are so many new apps and 
mobile devices that we just can’t live without. 
The POD was created to manage all your USB mobile devices so that you will never be without power or have to do anything else except take this handy little device with you. Simply plug your USB cable 
into the USB port of the POD and it will turn on automatically. The color band will start glowing around the unit and that’s how you know it is working. Once your 
unit is charged, you simply unplug the USB cable and the glowing power indicator 
will automatically turn off. 
The
POD is a fully maintenance free unit, which means you will never have to charge
it for the next 10 years. This unit comes with an adjustable mounting
strap that fits all cell phones. With the shape of the POD, it fits
perfectly in the palm of your hand giving you a better more comfortable grip, meaning
less likelihood of dropping, when mounted to your cell phone. The adjustable
strap can also be worn on your wrist, belt loop or  purse strap for your convenience. I added an ultra bright LED
flashlight to the front of the POD so you can just tap the light and it goes
on, when you tap it again it will go off. I added this because we never have a
light when we need it. So enjoy this feature.


Additionally the POD also works on the 1st mobile device... YOUR CAR! That’s right, I said your 
car. The car battery doesn’t die as fast or as often as other power sources do, 
but it does die, so if you ever get stuck, you now can stay in the safety of your 
car and use the POD's Perfect Add-On ""Car-Jumpstart Kit"". Simply attach the 
POD, using the CONNECTING CABLE into the CIGARETTE LIGHTER ADAPTER. The Power Meter will show you when the 
battery is charged. Super simple, Super easy. How cool is that?



Now Compare: Portable Power Units vs. P.O.D. 
1) 
They get 2x to 4x
more battery life. 
     POD runs
for 10 years.  
2) 
They have another
device to charge. 
     POD is
maintenance free
3) 
They have you balance
two devices in your hand.  
     POD’s
adjustable strap secures safely to your cell phone acting as one unit.
4) 
Basically they are a
battery in a case. 
     POD is the next
evolution in technology
5)  They require you to find an
outlet 
    POD needs no electricity to recharge
6)  Cellphone flashlight apps are
the #1 source of Malware and Identity theft for        500 million users... POD has a Built-in
flashlight and optional Car Jumpstart

POD PRICE $49.95               CAR JUMPSTART KIT (POD not included)  $14.95 


What We Need 
 
I 
have two prototypes, a black one and a white one that were made on a 3D printer. In order to be productive, the funds we raise will go towards the Tooling, Molds, Custom 
Circuit Boards, Die Cuts, any funds over our goal will go to setting up the 1st production run. Our goal is 
to raise $50,000.00 within the next 30 days. 


Custom POD Orders: Pick a color, texture and add your Logo for promotions, advertising and
or give-a-ways. (100 Minimum )  




The Impact
 
Let's 
look at the demographics. Who over the age of 5 years old doesn’t have 
some kind of mobile device? It's Global. We know this technology is a real game 
changer. Just think of the enhanced productivity that will be possible for so many people.  No more sales people who lose a sale because they ran out of power on an important call.  I am sure that this will even save lives.  Think of the people out hiking who get lost for days and their cell phones run out of power.  Or people trapped in a blizzard and their car battery dies.  And won’t those family car rides be more enjoyable when each of the kids can play their games without getting upset that the batteries died?
 The POD  has a global impact that will benefit lives in remote places and crowded urban areas, including compatibility with GREEN technology as it leaves no carbon footprint, and will even save power that would be used to recharge the batteries of millions of devices. An added benefit is that we will be creating around 300 to 500 jobs within the 1st year right here in America by bringing manufacturing back to the U.S.

<p><b><b>FAQs</b><br/></b></p><p><b>What
is 3D printing?</b></p><p>3D printing
is a method by which people can create 3D objects from 3D designs through a
process called additive manufacturing. Successive layers of material are laid
down on top of each other until the object has been created.</p><p></p>
<p>
</p><p>
<b></b></p><p><b>What
is the MOD-t?</b></p><p>The MOD-t is
an easy-to-use, affordable 3D printer designed for homes and schools. It’s
ready-to-use right out of the box and doesn’t require any advanced configuring or adjusting to get started. With built-in Wi-Fi and a web-based control system, you can easily operate your MOD-t from your computer, laptop, smartphone, or tablet. The MOD-t
is also remarkably quiet, perfect for the back of the classroom or the living
room. Combined with a library of hundreds of free designs and compatibility for
use with PLA, a biodegradable plastic, getting started with 3D printing has
never been easier.</p>
<p><b>What can
you print with the MOD-t?</b></p>
<p>You can print anything that has a
corresponding 3D design and that will fit within the build area. The New Matter
Store was created so that users can easily download curated designs on the
MOD-t. More advanced users can also upload their own .STL or .OBJ files to
print on the MOD-t.</p>
<p>
<b>
    What is the material this printer uses?<br/></b></p><p>The New Matter MOD-t prints in 
  <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polylactic_acid"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;"" target=""_blank"">polylactic acid (PLA)
  </a>. PLA is a benign, environmentally friendly and biodegradable thermoplastic, typically made from renewable sources such as corn or tapioca. PLA is used in a variety of applications from compostable packaging material to medical implants.</p>
<p><b>Is the printing material safe?</b></p><p>Yes, PLA is a safe material.<br/></p>
<p>
<b>Does the MOD-t take standard PLA, or is it cartridge based?<br/></b></p><p>The MOD-t is designed to accept any 1.75mm diameter PLA filament. However, we strongly recommend buying from a reputable source due to the widely varying quality of filament available on the market.</p>
<p>
<b>What size PLA filament does the MOD-t take?<br/></b></p><p>1.75mm diameter</p>
<p>
<b>What is the resolution quality of the MOD-t?<br/></b></p><p>The resolution is determined by both layer thickness and nozzle diameter. In the horizontal plane, the nozzle diameter (0.4 mm) limits the resolution to approximately 0.5 mm. In the vertical axis, the minimum supported layer thickness is 0.2 mm.</p>
<p>
<b>Is the printing material safe?<br/></b></p><p>Yes, PLA is a safe material.</p>
<p>
<b>Is the material eco-friendly and can I put it in my recycling bin?<br/></b></p><p>PLA is biodegradable and will, with time, decompose into harmless lactic acid. It is also a recyclable material, with an SPI resin code of 7. Unfortunately, 3D printed objects will not be suitably marked with this code and therefore recycling facilities will be unable to recycle your objects. We hope that, with time and as 3D printing grows in popularity, processes will be developed to allow 3D printed objects to be identified and recycled.</p>
<p>
<b>Since PLA is biodegradable, can objects printed with PLA be used to store or serve food?<br/></b></p><p>While PLA has been used for professionally manufactured food storage and service containers, we do not recommend that you use your 3D printed objects for this purpose. We found <a href=""http://reprage.com/post/36869678168/is-3d-printed-pla-food-safe/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">this blog article</a> to be particularly informative. </p>
<p>
<b>How much power does the MOD-t use?<br/></b></p><p>The maximum power the MOD-t consumes is 80 Watts, however the average power usage will be substantially below that. In other words, it's about like a laptop computer.</p>
<p>
<b>How long will it take to print something?<br/></b></p><p>Build time depends entirely on the object being built, and can be affected by factors such as object size, chosen layer resolution, level of detail in the object, and infill type (solid, hollow, or partially filled). Typical build times can be as short as 30 minutes for relatively small objects to several hours or more for large objects.</p>
<p>
<b>Which of my devices will work with the MOD-t</b></p><p>The MOD-t is operated via a browser-based interface accessible through most modern and updated desktop and mobile browsers: Mac OSX 10.7+, Windows 7+ (required for setup only).<br/></p>
<p>
<b>What’s the nozzle diameter, build volume, print speed, etc..?<br/></b></p><p><a href=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1461799603/Specs_fvdmex.jpg"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">See the technical specs above</a>.</p>
<p><b>Is the bed removable?<br/></b></p><p>Yes! Our unique motion system allows the print bed to be simply lifted out of the printer when you need to remove an object or prepare the bed for building your next object. To reinstall, simply place the bed onto the drive rods.</p>
<p><b>Does the printer have auto-leveling?<br/></b><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;"">Because the MOD-t’s unique mechanism slide the build plate across the drive rods at a consistent height, bed leveling is completely unnecessary.</span></p>
<p><b>What about build plate calibration and zeroing?<br/></b>The MOD-t performs automatic feedback based centering and homing at the start of each print to position the build plate and ensure the first layer will go down correctly every time.</p><p></p><p><b>Where can I buy the MOD-t?</b></p>

<p>PLANiT is a mobile solution designed to make interacting with other people offline, simple. A platform designed specifically to create, share, and explore upcoming events at your location or in your social network. </p>
<p>When trying to do anything with other people physically around us or in our social circles we're often left with very few options for exploration or coordination.</p>
<p><strong>Texting…</strong> Texting someone to make plans is a hassle, and the information you get is completely dependent on what that person tells you. Group texting to set up rides, pick-up basketball games, meetings, and get together is cumbersome. And when it comes to social discovery, no one wants to send out that desperate mass “What’s going on tonight” text to all their friends.</p>
<p><strong>Emailing… </strong>Very similar to texting , emailing often encounters the “volley phenomenon” where you must go back and forth successfully to iron out details.</p>
<p><strong>Facebook/Twitter..</strong>  Social media sites do an amazing job of harnessing the power of the internet to allow users from all over the world to connect and share thoughts, ideas, and opinions. But trying to find something to do on a Saturday night on Twitter or Facebook inevitably leads to a night scrolling on the couch.</p>
<p><strong>Google..  </strong> Searching the web for something to do often times has limited result due to lack of webpages dedicated to broadcasting opportunities for physical interaction. Google calendar is not a social platform for sharing and promoting events, and Google+.. Is well…they should’ve stuck to Search &amp; email.</p>
<p><strong>Why do people need it?</strong></p>
<p>Smart phones are built for fulfilling two main customer needs; communication (texting, calling, emailing) and exploration (internet, social media) and PLANiT maximizes the utility of these functions. Whether it’s keeping better track of your daily schedule, meeting some friends for lunch, or exploring your city’s night life for something to do – PLANiT does it all.</p>
<p>And to those who argue that smart phones are also for sharing pictures, videos, and documents…we agree. PLANiT will be updating to adopt those features after our launch!</p>

<p> </p></div>","What is PLANiT?
PLANiT is a mobile solution designed to make interacting with other people offline, simple. A platform designed specifically to create, share, and explore upcoming events at your location or in your social network. 
When trying to do anything with other people physically around us or in our social circles we're often left with very few options for exploration or coordination.
Texting… Texting someone to make plans is a hassle, and the information you get is completely dependent on what that person tells you. Group texting to set up rides, pick-up basketball games, meetings, and get together is cumbersome. And when it comes to social discovery, no one wants to send out that desperate mass “What’s going on tonight” text to all their friends.
Emailing… Very similar to texting , emailing often encounters the “volley phenomenon” where you must go back and forth successfully to iron out details.
Facebook/Twitter..  Social media sites do an amazing job of harnessing the power of the internet to allow users from all over the world to connect and share thoughts, ideas, and opinions. But trying to find something to do on a Saturday night on Twitter or Facebook inevitably leads to a night scrolling on the couch.
Google..   Searching the web for something to do often times has limited result due to lack of webpages dedicated to broadcasting opportunities for physical interaction. Google calendar is not a social platform for sharing and promoting events, and Google+.. Is well…they should’ve stuck to Search & email.
Why do people need it?
Smart phones are built for fulfilling two main customer needs; communication (texting, calling, emailing) and exploration (internet, social media) and PLANiT maximizes the utility of these functions. Whether it’s keeping better track of your daily schedule, meeting some friends for lunch, or exploring your city’s night life for something to do – PLANiT does it all.
And to those who argue that smart phones are also for sharing pictures, videos, and documents…we agree. PLANiT will be updating to adopt those features after our launch!
 
Screens

The PLANiT experience begins with seamless registration from day one. Just fill in email and password for an account and optional info for friends and family to find you more easily.
 

Home screen offers instant access to everything going on in your life right now. Quickly see commitments for your day, week and month or add an event, all with the touch of a finger.

 

 
The Beacon Feed is a live stream of shared upcoming events from people you are connected to.

But once you add on all the other pieces needed to turn it into a usable computer, you usually end up with either a bunch of separate components connected with cables and wires, or a rather big and clunky box (for most integrated solutions).</p><p>What's been missing is a compact, integrated Raspberry Pi based handheld computer, comparable to a modern mobile phone.</p><p><i>Until now.</i></p><p>I've been thinking about such a device for a while, and started working on one last year. After many designs, redesigns and prototypes, the Noodle Pi is finally ready to bring computing freedom to your pocket!</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1503465738/pdvjjioq619wlo8vkqgz.png"" src=""""/></p><h3>Say Hello to Noodle Pi</h3><p>Noodle Pi integrates a Raspberry Pi Zero, a high-resolution multi-touch screen, a battery, a power management system, and a camera, all in a super compact device that's good to go anywhere. </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1503465892/utv9evnchkwsnrsy5cg2.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>Noodle Pi integrates a beautiful high resolution 3.5"" capacitive touchscreen with 800x480 pixels at ~270 PPI, 18-bit color (262,144 colors), and a 60 FPS frame rate.</p><p>Noodle Pi also integrates the Raspberry Pi Camera Module v2, for up to 8MP still photos, and 1080p30 / 720p60 / VGA90 video.</p><p>Noodle Pi is powered by an internal 500mAh battery. It can be charged via a regular micro-USB charging socket, and there's a red LED to provide a low battery warning.</p><h3>Strong, Slim, Unibody Design</h3><p>Noodle Pi's unibody shell is strong and light, with an innovative design that leverages the unique capabilities of 3D printing.</p><p>This enables Noodle Pi to pack six separate components, plus connecting wires, into a tiny 93mm x 60mm x 10mm/19mm package. Yes, part of it is only 10mm thick! (The iPhone SE, in comparison, is 7.6mm; the official Pi Zero case is 13mm).</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1503465984/zy9vaegizjhchknai6ru.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>Noodle Pi puts those extra few millimeters to good use. It provides full access to the Pi Zero's USB-OTG and Mini-HDMI ports, so it can be used both as a pocket computer and as a desktop computer. As well as in other configurations. The possibilities are endless!</p><p>Despite its super compact size, Noodle Pi is surprisingly strong and sturdy. It feels like a solid, integrated device when you hold it in your hand, not very different from a $900 iPhone.</p><p>And, it's available in Jet Black! ;-)</p><h3>Escape The Walled Garden</h3><p>Unlike iOS and Android devices, which force you to develop apps in only specific programming languages in a restrictive environment, a Noodle Pi is a full GNU/Linux computer. So you can write apps for it in any language you like.</p><p>And once you've written an app for Noodle Pi, you can just release it to the world right away. No need to wait weeks or months for approval to be listed in an app store.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1503466054/hnmpilyonzpfzvj5nzn2.png"" src=""""/></p><p>Noodle Pi offers a long overdue escape from the walled gardens mobile computing has been stuck in. It's the mobile device built on free software, reusable components and open platforms. The way computing was meant to be!</p><h3>One More Thing: Noodle Air</h3><p>Noodle Pi can be built in two configurations - either using a Pi Zero W, in which case it's a fully connected computer with WiFi and Bluetooth, or using a Pi Zero v1.3, which doesn't include wireless networking capabilities.</p><p>When built using a Pi Zero v1.3, it's a whole different gizmo, the Noodle Air, so named because it's an ""air-gapped"" mobile PC. Noodle Air is effectively invulnerable to snooping or attack over the Internet, as the device doesn't (and cannot, without external hardware) connect to any networks.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1503466266/eszc801rc25c38qb37z2.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>In these days of pervasive surveillance and malware, an indispensable piece of kit everyone needs is an air-gapped computer that is never connected to any networks. Noodle Air is that computer.</p><p>A Noodle Air enables easy and cost-effective air-gapped security for password storage, crypto-currency cold-storage, secure backups, private notes and photos, and so on. Just be sure never to connect it to any networks, and to keep your MicroSD card physically secure at all times.</p><h3>One Device, Unlimited Users</h3><p>In fact, because the Noodle Pi runs entirely off the MicroSD card, a single Noodle Pi or Noodle Air can easily be securely shared by any number of people. Everyone just keeps their own private system on their own MicroSD card.</p><p>This enables libraries, schools, etc. to provide shared access to devices that many people can use without compromising privacy or security.</p><h3><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Accessories</span></h3><p>I've developed a number of accessories for Noodle Pi as well. They are:</p><ul>
<li>Splash-Resistant Case</li>
<li>Belt Holster</li>
<li>Clip Holster</li>
<li>Noodle Key Micro - Micro Keyboard + Touchpad Dock</li>
<li>Noodle Key Micro+ - Alternate Micro Keyboard + Touchpad Dock</li>
<li>Noodle Key Mini - Mini Keyboard + Touchpad Dock</li>
<li>Noodlendo NES game controller dock</li>
<li>Noodle Wrist watch strap dock</li>
</ul><p>More details on some of these:</p><p>The Noodle Key Micro dock enables docking the Noodle Pi with a tiny RF keyboard and touchpad. I made sure to select a backlit mini-keyboard for the Noodle Key Micro, so you can keep working in low light conditions. The keyboard is readily available on Amazon.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1503466720/d8qopwgjbyqyu4awkddm.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>The Noodle Key Micro docked with a micro-keyboard+touchpad makes all the difference when you don't want to waste precious screen space on an on-screen keyboard, and want to work fast. Perfect for writing code or articles on your Noodle Pi, or administering servers using ssh.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1503466741/rq9gcrg7tzsdnd6lbbfj.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>Noodle Key Micro holds the Noodle Pi secure while docked, and easily disconnects from the Noodle Pi and the keyboard when not needed. It's tiny, light, and easy to carry around in a pocket, just like the Noodle Pi and the mini keyboard.</p><p>After using a prototype Noodle Pi with the micro-keyboard Noodle Key Micro dock for a while, I realized that although it's perfect for quick on-the-go sysadmin things, it's not quite optimal when you want to write text or code really fast. So for that, there's now the Noodle Key Mini dock! </p><p>The Noodle Key Mini docks with a folding bluetooth keyboard+trackpad (readily available on Amazon) which, when folded, isn't much bigger than the smaller micro-keyboard+touchpad, yet folds out to a very reasonably sized keyboard that's perfectly suited for working at full speed.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1503467386/oc4jcxvymh6hvnckhwrv.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>How awesome is that?</p><p>But hey.. it's not all work in Noodle Pi land.

The space around the connector is very restricted and regular HDMI cables will not fit there.</p><h3>Some Assembly Required</h3><p>Noodle Pi is a DIY computer. You have to put it together yourself. This is easy and fun to do, and takes about half an hour. No soldering required. You don't even need a screwdriver.</p><p>You can also take Noodle Pi apart just as easily, which means you can swap in replacement parts or upgraded components at any time. So when the next version of the Pi Zero is released you will just be able to swap in the new Pi Zero (as long as its shape / size is the same, which is most likely), and upgrade your Noodle Pi in a few minutes!</p><p>The Noodle Pi kit includes all the parts you need to put the computer together, except the electronic components and battery. You will need to purchase these components from the sources listed below.</p><p>If you'd like a complete pre-assembled Noodle Pi you can pre-order one from the Noodle Pi website.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1503467775/ddgcyfhaegszeqa2qrow.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>These are the parts you'll need to buy:</p><p>1.

</div><h3>History</h3><p>I've been working on building a practical GNU/Linux wearable computer for over 17 years, so this is quite a long story.</p><p>Originally, the main motivation was to be able to work (i.e. write code, documentation, etc.) more comfortably and more hours in a day. I wanted to be able to work equally comfortably while standing, sitting or lying down, or walking around. And also to have a fully functional computer on me at all times.</p><p>A wearable computer with a head-mounted display (HMD), running a free OS such as GNU/Linux or OpenBSD sounded like just the thing I needed, so that was the goal.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1503516830/gm7uys0r46rgzjlt3yzz.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>Sometime around year 2000 I installed GNU/Linux on a Compaq iPaq, and that was my first GNU/Linux handheld. I used it a lot, for all sorts of work, while traveling in the Himalayas and connecting to the 'net over dialup from pay phones (known as ""PCOs"" in India).</p><p>My first working wearable with an HMD was in 2001, a Sony VAIO Picturebook hooked up to a Daeyang CyVisor, which I later sawed in half to make a monocular display, so I could still see my surroundings while wearing it.</p><p>The Picturebook's video output wasn't directly compatible with the CyVisor, so I also had to throw in a KVM switch in there which fixed the VGA output for the CyVisor. The input device was a Twiddler, which didn't come in a USB version at the time, so there were more cables and adapters to convert from PS/2 to USB.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1503516919/uhgncb9mxl6p1ekiddx2.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>All those cables and separate components went in a slim Rollerblade backpack. It ended up looking a bit like HP's new wearable workstation. The batteries on the Picturebook and the CyVisor didn't last long, so it wasn't the most usable system. Nevertheless, I did use it quite a bit. I remember using it to work on code while accompanying a friend grocery shopping in Montreal.</p><p>It didn't take long for me to come to the conclusion that HMD technology had a ways to go and so I spent much of the next decade using small GNU/Linux and OpenBSD handhelds, primarily the Sharp Zaurus SL-C3x00 and Nokia N800 and N810. When the iPhone came out I was a late adopter (didn't get one till 2009) because the Zaurus and N810 had higher resolution screens and ran GNU/Linux / OpenBSD.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1503516972/nburlzaru0dxgogamo2a.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>I did keep trying different HMDs over the years, including the Xybernaut Poma (which ran WinCE - horrible! only use I had for it was to read PDFs and VNC out to a real machine), the super-difficult-to-get-hold-of TacEye LT (more on that below), the Micro-Optical MD-6, and the Sony Glasstron PLM-S700E, which still feels like something from the future!</p><p>Eventually, I did get an iPod Touch, and then an iPhone. I still held on to my Zaurus for emergency sysadmin work on the go, and got many new tiny laptops from Fujitsu and Sony, and a Nokia N9, an N900 and an N950.</p><p>But none of these quite hit the spot. The iPhone was a huge step forward in wearable computers, with its revolutionary touch interface, but also a huge step back, being a walled garden, and closed off to most free software tools. Nokia had an awesome GNU/Linux based platform that could really have taken over the world, but Nokia decided to self-destruct. And the Zaurus, although the most usable of the lot, was still too small and fiddly, and didn't have backlit keys or built-in WiFi or Bluetooth.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1503517017/vf2uyiziwzw7cnhymfln.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>Then in 2012 I got a Raspberry Pi. I also had a Tac-Eye LT by then, so of course I immediately created a Pi-based wearable with the two. The Pi outputs HDMI, and the Tac-Eye LT uses VGA, so some more adapters had to be researched and tested, and eventually one worked.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1503517116/gkkakzdjs74ecz7lsqix.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>This was the smallest HMD-equipped wearable I'd made till then. But it still wasn't that practical. And my Pi had trouble using multiple USB devices at the same time. It seemed to be a common issue with 1st gen Pis.</p><p>Some of the variations of this wearable (photos below) allowed for hot-swappable external batteries, so they could be used uninterrupted for any length of time without needing to be tethered to an AC outlet. This was something I'd sorely missed in my Picturebook based wearable. </p><p>Happy to say, Noodle Pi provides this ability too. Thanks to its internal battery and 5V charging, it can be charged via small external USB battery packs which can be hot-swapped as needed to achieve unlimited mobile battery life.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1503517157/wtqirtq22di4nvo0cfim.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>In 2014 I got a Google Glass XE, and although it ran a horribly old and limited version of Android, it was a massive leap forward in terms of size, weight, and ergonomics. It's natively not much more useful than the WinCE based Xybernaut Poma (except for being a much better GoPro than a GoPro) so I immediately installed a VNC app and hacked up a connection to the Zaurus. And that was my first OpenBSD wearable with an HMD.</p><p>But a software update removed Glass's ability to use a bluetooth keyboard and mouse, and again my plans were thwarted! (This functionality is back in the latest Glass software update, so I plan to give it another go soon). Another problem with the Google Glass is that it gets pretty hot while you're wearing it. I worry about the radiation it may be frying my brain with. Plus it's super expensive and not easy to carry around.</p><p>All those problems were solved by a revolutionary Kickstarter in 2015 - Vufine. Their monocular HMD does everything right - it's just an HMD, with a small integrated battery, and no integrated underpowered, overpriced, overheating computer. And HDMI input so you can hook up any computer, including a little Pi or a Pi Zero!</p><p>I backed it immediately, and as soon as I had my Vufine, I started prototyping various wearables with it. In late 2014 I'd also resumed work on an old idea for end-to-end provably unsnoopable messaging that I had back in the early 2000s, but had put on hold. When I resumed work on this in 2014, I thought I'd write it as an iOS app, but when I tried to learn iOS programming I found it extremely tedious, and I also wasn't so keen on the idea of having to get my app approved by Apple (and the possibility of it not being approved).</p><p>But there didn't seem any other option, so I kept trying to learn iOS programming, which was made problematic by the fact that XCode and iOS kept going through compatibility-breaking updates, and then my MacBook Air had a malfunction and had to go in for repairs, and of course you can't code an iOS app on anything other than a Mac.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1503517222/pwffhfzyo2ezffbfgi4g.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>Then in July 2016 I had another idea.. what if I made a Raspberry Pi based handheld? Then I could write my Unsnoopable app in Perl, my preferred programming language!</p><p>And that's when Noodle Pi was conceived. I worked on a number of prototypes, which used various touchscreen displays, mostly from Adafruit. I ended up destroying many touchscreens in the process of trying to slim down the device as much as possible.</p><p>In December 2016, I realized I could use Noodle Pi for another of my very old on-hold software projects, which I didn't relish trying to write for iOS, and whose fate I was not OK to leave up to Apple's whims. This was HashCash, a digital cash system I've been working on since the late 90s.</p><p>Once I realized Noodle Pi would be perfect for HashCash as well, I fired up Emacs, pulled out my dusty old HashCash code, and got to work. The next six months I barely had any time to eat and sleep, between writing HashCash and working on Noodle Pi prototypes.</p><p>Finally, in June 2017, I released a beta of HashCash and Unsnoopable, and just around that time I received an email announcing the release of the Pimoroni HyperPixel display. A quick look at the specs revealed this would be the perfect screen for Noodle Pi, but by the time I got to Pimoroni's site the display had already sold out! I clicked to be notified when it was back in stock, and I was, but it sold out again within a few hours, and I had to wait for it to come back into stock a second time before I could get hold of a few of them.</p><p>A few days later the displays finally arrived, and after another multi-week storm of redesigning and prototyping (I was literally designing prototypes in my dreams while sleeping!)

But once you add on all the other pieces needed to turn it into a usable computer, you usually end up with either a bunch of separate components connected with cables and wires, or a rather big and clunky box (for most integrated solutions).What's been missing is a compact, integrated Raspberry Pi based handheld computer, comparable to a modern mobile phone.Until now.I've been thinking about such a device for a while, and started working on one last year. After many designs, redesigns and prototypes, the Noodle Pi is finally ready to bring computing freedom to your pocket!Say Hello to Noodle PiNoodle Pi integrates a Raspberry Pi Zero, a high-resolution multi-touch screen, a battery, a power management system, and a camera, all in a super compact device that's good to go anywhere. Noodle Pi integrates a beautiful high resolution 3.5"" capacitive touchscreen with 800x480 pixels at ~270 PPI, 18-bit color (262,144 colors), and a 60 FPS frame rate.Noodle Pi also integrates the Raspberry Pi Camera Module v2, for up to 8MP still photos, and 1080p30 / 720p60 / VGA90 video.Noodle Pi is powered by an internal 500mAh battery. It can be charged via a regular micro-USB charging socket, and there's a red LED to provide a low battery warning.Strong, Slim, Unibody DesignNoodle Pi's unibody shell is strong and light, with an innovative design that leverages the unique capabilities of 3D printing.This enables Noodle Pi to pack six separate components, plus connecting wires, into a tiny 93mm x 60mm x 10mm/19mm package. Yes, part of it is only 10mm thick! (The iPhone SE, in comparison, is 7.6mm; the official Pi Zero case is 13mm).Noodle Pi puts those extra few millimeters to good use. It provides full access to the Pi Zero's USB-OTG and Mini-HDMI ports, so it can be used both as a pocket computer and as a desktop computer. As well as in other configurations. The possibilities are endless!Despite its super compact size, Noodle Pi is surprisingly strong and sturdy. It feels like a solid, integrated device when you hold it in your hand, not very different from a $900 iPhone.And, it's available in Jet Black! ;-)Escape The Walled GardenUnlike iOS and Android devices, which force you to develop apps in only specific programming languages in a restrictive environment, a Noodle Pi is a full GNU/Linux computer. So you can write apps for it in any language you like.And once you've written an app for Noodle Pi, you can just release it to the world right away. No need to wait weeks or months for approval to be listed in an app store.Noodle Pi offers a long overdue escape from the walled gardens mobile computing has been stuck in. It's the mobile device built on free software, reusable components and open platforms. The way computing was meant to be!One More Thing: Noodle AirNoodle Pi can be built in two configurations - either using a Pi Zero W, in which case it's a fully connected computer with WiFi and Bluetooth, or using a Pi Zero v1.3, which doesn't include wireless networking capabilities.When built using a Pi Zero v1.3, it's a whole different gizmo, the Noodle Air, so named because it's an ""air-gapped"" mobile PC. Noodle Air is effectively invulnerable to snooping or attack over the Internet, as the device doesn't (and cannot, without external hardware) connect to any networks.In these days of pervasive surveillance and malware, an indispensable piece of kit everyone needs is an air-gapped computer that is never connected to any networks. Noodle Air is that computer.A Noodle Air enables easy and cost-effective air-gapped security for password storage, crypto-currency cold-storage, secure backups, private notes and photos, and so on. Just be sure never to connect it to any networks, and to keep your MicroSD card physically secure at all times.One Device, Unlimited UsersIn fact, because the Noodle Pi runs entirely off the MicroSD card, a single Noodle Pi or Noodle Air can easily be securely shared by any number of people. Everyone just keeps their own private system on their own MicroSD card.This enables libraries, schools, etc. to provide shared access to devices that many people can use without compromising privacy or security.AccessoriesI've developed a number of accessories for Noodle Pi as well. They are:
Splash-Resistant Case
Belt Holster
Clip Holster
Noodle Key Micro - Micro Keyboard + Touchpad Dock
Noodle Key Micro+ - Alternate Micro Keyboard + Touchpad Dock
Noodle Key Mini - Mini Keyboard + Touchpad Dock
Noodlendo NES game controller dock
Noodle Wrist watch strap dock
More details on some of these:The Noodle Key Micro dock enables docking the Noodle Pi with a tiny RF keyboard and touchpad. I made sure to select a backlit mini-keyboard for the Noodle Key Micro, so you can keep working in low light conditions. The keyboard is readily available on Amazon.The Noodle Key Micro docked with a micro-keyboard+touchpad makes all the difference when you don't want to waste precious screen space on an on-screen keyboard, and want to work fast. Perfect for writing code or articles on your Noodle Pi, or administering servers using ssh.Noodle Key Micro holds the Noodle Pi secure while docked, and easily disconnects from the Noodle Pi and the keyboard when not needed. It's tiny, light, and easy to carry around in a pocket, just like the Noodle Pi and the mini keyboard.After using a prototype Noodle Pi with the micro-keyboard Noodle Key Micro dock for a while, I realized that although it's perfect for quick on-the-go sysadmin things, it's not quite optimal when you want to write text or code really fast. So for that, there's now the Noodle Key Mini dock! The Noodle Key Mini docks with a folding bluetooth keyboard+trackpad (readily available on Amazon) which, when folded, isn't much bigger than the smaller micro-keyboard+touchpad, yet folds out to a very reasonably sized keyboard that's perfectly suited for working at full speed.How awesome is that?But hey.. it's not all work in Noodle Pi land. When all the sysadmin stuff has been taken care of, and all the code, documentation and articles have been committed to their repositories, it's time to let the hair down and shoot up some aliens!That's when we pop on the Noodlendo dock!And here's one more awesome accessory: the Noodle Wrist watch strap dock! Just attach your favorite 22mm watch strap and wear Noodle Pi on your wrist!There's also one more important accessory: an HDMI Ribbon Cable. You'll need this if you want to use the HDMI output on Noodle Pi. The space around the connector is very restricted and regular HDMI cables will not fit there.Some Assembly RequiredNoodle Pi is a DIY computer. You have to put it together yourself. This is easy and fun to do, and takes about half an hour. No soldering required. You don't even need a screwdriver.You can also take Noodle Pi apart just as easily, which means you can swap in replacement parts or upgraded components at any time. So when the next version of the Pi Zero is released you will just be able to swap in the new Pi Zero (as long as its shape / size is the same, which is most likely), and upgrade your Noodle Pi in a few minutes!The Noodle Pi kit includes all the parts you need to put the computer together, except the electronic components and battery. You will need to purchase these components from the sources listed below.If you'd like a complete pre-assembled Noodle Pi you can pre-order one from the Noodle Pi website.These are the parts you'll need to buy:1. Raspberry Pi Zero and Pi Camera Module v2. These are available from many sources. A full list of distributors can be found here. Both Pimoroni and Adafruit (who manufacture some of the other components needed) also sell the Pi Zero and the Camera Module. Adafruit: Pi Zero + camera bundlesPimoroni: Pi Zero or Pi Zero W and Camera2. Pimoroni HyperPixel PIM297 Display[UPDATE 08.2018 - NOTE that Pimoroni has discontinued the PIM297 HyperPixel 3.5"" display needed to assemble Noodle Pi. The new PIM370 HyperPixel 4.0 display is not compatible with the Noodle Pi kit. You may still be able to find the odd HyperPixel 3.5"" display on eBay. I will update this page when I have a new version of Noodle Pi ready for launch. You can also subscribe to the Noodle Pi mailing list, from http://noodlepi.com/mailinglist.]3. Adafruit 500mA LiPo Battery4. Adafruit PowerBoost 1000C5. Pimoroni Hammer Header (Male) with Installation Jig. Both Pimoroni and Adafruit sell this.You'll also need a hammer to install the hammer header onto the Pi Zero. And a flush wire cutter (a nail clipper will also work) to clip the header pins on the underside of the Pi Zero so they don't stick out from the board too much.If you're happy to solder on a regular header you could do that instead, or course. The hammer header is just a lot easier and faster to install.Pi Supply now also sells Pi Zero Ws with pre-soldered-on headers. If you get one of these you don't need the hammer header, or the hammer.Everything else you need to put the Noodle Pi together will be in the kit. That will include: the shell, a mini on/off switch, a few more important parts, a pre-folded pi zero camera cable, a micro-USB-OTG adapter, and details on how to put everything together. Featured On                                Click here for Press Kit

I have a AAS in Civil Engineering Technology and have spent 20+ years in the construction industry. I want to modernize Handyman Services to bring energy efficient and new technologies to homes in the Ohio region. Contributions to my business will help me test new products, market those products, hire employees to install and trouble shoot those products. 
   What We Need & What You Get 
I am asking for $50,000 to open an office where these products can be tested and displayed for future clients.  Today's youth is more engaged in technology more than ever. They will be our future in guiding this new technology for future generations. If all the funding is not acquired I will still pursue installing these products in every home in my territory which is Stark County, Ohio
REFFERAL CONTEST!!
*Stark County Ohio Area Only*
   
  Risks & Challenges  People value your transparency. Be open and stand out by providing insight into the risks and obstacles you may face on the way to achieving your goal. 
One of the Risk is that people are scared about the technology tracking your personal information. We all need to work with companies such as Google to make sure all information is kept private.

<p>One day
there was a boy. He came up with a vision to change the world. That vision was
so strong, real and influential that he could not sleep or eat until he came up
with an idea. It was the idea. The idea how to empower creative people to shape
space in the matter of time. And the journey began. He traveled through the
world looking for the soulmates who could help him to make the idea alive. But
it was not so easy. The search took ages. The moment he stopped looking for
soulmates and started building the idea on his own, the soulmates - comrades in
arms found him. And they helped him to build a machine which could build
anything. Which could  create an idea into a substance in seconds.
 That was it, that was the Phantom 3D printer. But there was still some
work left to do. To show the magic box to the world, the boy needed one more
helping hand, he needed  the Backers.
People who believed in the idea so much that they assisted him by spreading the
news about this invention and helping him financially. Probably, without these
great people Phantom 3D printer would have never seen the daylight. Be special!
Be innovative! Be creative!  Be our supporter!</p>
<p>Phantom is a
3D printer, using plastic as its building material, with two <b>individually
working extruders</b> . It allows to print in <b>35 cm X 35 cm X 35 cm
(13.8 inch X 13.8 inch X 13.8 inch)</b> printing space. Due to
large space and two individual extruders, 3D Phantom printer is capable of
printing two separate objects simultaneously <b>15 cm X 35 cm X 35 cm
(5.9 inch X 13.8 inch X 13.8 inch )</b> or one large part.  That
affects efficiency, as well. This printer <b>prints 1.5-2 times faster</b>
compared to any other 3D printer in the market. Whole printers size is <b>70
cm X 65 cm X 65 cm (27.6 inch X 25.6 inch X 25.6 inch).</b> What is more, <b>cooled
printing camera </b>helps by increasing extruders performance and
maximizing printing quality. <b>Phantom 3D printer has easily changeable
plastic cartridges</b> which will be available on our e-store, which will make
it more user friendly. We made easily changeable cartridges, because that is
one of the main concerns in the whole printing process. We installed <b>indicators
that will show when plastic brakes or cartridges needs to be replaced</b>.
These functions makes Phantom 3D printers unique upon other 3D printers.</p>
<p><b><u>Printers design:</u></b></p>
<p>Currently, available
in white corpus design. Later, variety will be expanded with
wider colour choice - black, yellow and red.</p>
<p>Next
model is Phantom Mini. It will be available in late 2016 and it will have <b>20
cm X 20 cm X 20 cm (7.9 inch X 7.9 inch X 7.9 inch)</b> printing
field.  Whole printer size will be <b>45 cm X  40 cm X 40
cm (17.7 inch X 15.7 inch X 15.7 inch).</b></p>
<p>For 3D
modeling we provide software - Sketchup. It is easy to use and it provides many

     always ends up in a huge negative influence in quality. The era of slow,
     hard to use 3D printers is over! Here comes our solution. Phantom 3D
     printer will be the only 3D printer which will have 2 individually working
     extruders, which if necessary, will allow to print one part together or
     two parts separately. In this way, we increased speed by two times without

Risks and challenges
While any
new endeavor involves risk, The Lark-Wi team has already completed Hardware
design, Product tooling 3D design, Software and APP design.
In the
team’s experience, there are several points in the design, manufacturing and
certification processes that could cause delays. We will keep you informed and
ensure you know right away if we have run into challenges. 
Certification, software and hardware design
all have the biggest potential to affect timing. There is always the
possibility of supplier delays. Whatever happens along our production timeline,
you can rest assured that we will keep you updated on our progress.",9.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<p>We couldn't have made it here without these awesome people</p>
<p><b>Mom, Dad, and the Red Bird - </b>You've encouraged us since the very beginning of our mission to make electronics truly portable. Thanks for bearing with our late night discussions, for your constant feedback and for always being there.</p>
<p><b>You - </b>Thank <b>YOU </b>for believing in us. Without you, none of this would be possible. Backing or sharing this campaign brings us one step closer to making ATOM a reality. <br/></p>

<p><b>Q: How long does it take to charge the ATOM?</b></p>
<p>A: The ATOM can be fully charged in under 90 minutes. It can power your iPhone 6 14 times or your speakers for 7-14 hours without having to charge the ATOM itself. Get an extra battery and use the ATOM for twice as long. </p>
<a name=""extrabattery"" rel=""nofollow noopener""></a>
<p><b>Q: What's an extra battery?</b></p>
<p>The ATOM can split into two halves. The top half has the power outlet. And the bottom half contains the battery, USB port and power button. Getting an extra battery is the same as getting an extra bottom half for your ATOM. If your ATOM ever runs out of battery outdoors, all you have to do is switch out this bottom half with another one that's fully charged. The great part is, the extra battery also acts as a power bank for your USB devices. So, if you're only using your phone or tablet, the bottom half is all you need.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Q: Does the ATOM come with a charger?</b></p>
<p>A: Yes, and you can charge your ATOM in 90 minutes!</p>
<p><b>Q: What's the difference between ATOM and a portable charger?</b></p>
<p>A: The ATOM has a built-in power outlet - similar to the wall outlets in your homes. It can power all your electronics up to 150W. Aside from being able to charge your laptops, phones and tablets, the ATOM can power a whole range of electronics including amps, lights and projectors.<span><br/></span></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Q: Does it have a battery indicator?</b></p>
<p>A: Yes! The ATOM has an LED battery life indicator next to its power button to let you know how much battery is left.</p>
<p><b><b>Q: Can I use the power outlet and USB port at the same time?</b><br/></b></p>
<p>A: Yes, that means you can power your monitor while you charge your smartphone at the same time. </p>
<p><b>Q: Is it waterproof?</b></p>
<p>A: Nope, and chances are your electronics aren't waterproof either! To make the ATOM waterproof would just mean more parts, and more money. Instead we decided not to include this feature and pass on the savings to you.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b></b></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Q: Can I connect a multiplug to the ATOM?</b></p>
<p>A: Yes! You can connect a multiplug or extension board to the ATOM to power multiple devices at once, as long as the total power is under 150W. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Q: Does it support 120V or 220V input? Is it compatible with US devices?</b></p>
<p>A: Upon choosing the perk for ATOM, you will be able to choose from either 120V or 220V based on your preference. We'll confirm your choice with you via email.</p>
<p><b>Q: So, what's Feature X?</b></p>
<p>A: <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">For those who have been with us from before the campaign, you've probably heard about </span><i style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Feature X -  </i><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">ATOM's surprise feature.

Frequently Asked Questions








A whole lot of power in one device. ATOM contains enough power to charge your phone for 13-18 full charges or even power your guitar amp for approximately 10 hours. 



If you choose to get an extra battery with your ATOM, you can power all your devices for TWICE as long, giving your speakers up to 28 hours of music or your monitor 8 hours of video. If you want to know more about the extra battery, check out our Frequently Asked Questions.




Electronics anywhere. Aside from being able to charge your phones and tablets, with ATOM's universal power outlet, you can now use your...ATOM can power a whole range of electronics from phones to musical instruments. The only question is - what will you do with portable electricity? Ever gone somewhere just to charge your laptop or phone? Tried looking for a power outlet but couldn't find any? Traveling or going outdoors? With the importance of technology in our everyday lives, we can never have enough juice.Now, you no longer have to worry about whether there's a power outlet or extension cord nearby. Stay connected and powered up throughout the day! Wherever you go, so should your ATOM.




We've managed to bring down the size of the ATOM by over 30% through several design iterations.
The ATOM conveniently splits into two halves for easy carrying and storage. When you need to use it again, it easily snaps back into place. 
If you're only using mobile and tablet devices, the bottom half is all you need. It functions as a standalone power bank.




Check out the ATOM powering speakers, lights, a monitor, a guitar amp, a glue gun and even soldering equipment. 






The ATOM can power all your electronics up to 150W. Here are the tech specs of our portable power outlet. 



For those of you interested in more detailed technical specifications, ATOM's Continuous Power Output is 150W and its Peak Power Output is 300W. 
ATOM produces a pure sine waveform to ensure your devices are safe.
Pure sine waves are the form of electricity that you get at your house - all electronics are designed to be used with this waveform.  Today’s devices are extremely finely tuned and any small changes may cause your electronics to malfunction. It's not just the quantity of energy, but also the quality of energy that matters. 




We've built a comprehensive set of safety features into the ATOM to ensure you and your devices are always protected.  










After months of prototyping, tests and development, we know ATOM is ready for the world. All we're missing is your help to make it a reality. If you share our vision for a newer and free-er age of portable power, please back us. 


By helping us meet our goal, we can start manufacturing the ATOM and let people from all over the world experience a new age of portable power. 

 






To ensure your ATOM gets to you on time, we've personally visited the factories to streamline manufacturing processes and source the highest quality components. 







Dependable Delivery
As a backer, you'll be updated with complete transparency on our journey from manufacturing to fulfilment through social media, e-mail and of course, our Indiegogo campaign page. 
We love your involvement and are always open to feedback and suggestions. Feel free to ask us anything by emailing us at contactus@getyouratom.com.





The ATOM InDemand Special is available at $199 for a limited time only! Order your ATOM now and enjoy $50 off retail price.

What's an Extra Battery? The ATOM can split into two halves. The top half has the power outlet. And the bottom half contains the battery, USB port and power button. Getting an extra battery is the same as getting an extra bottom half of the ATOM. If your ATOM ever runs out of battery outdoors, all you have to do is switch out the bottom half with another one that's fully charged.

<p><strong>16. Doesn’t modern smartphone already have auto cut off?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, smartphone will do that to prevent overcharging. It automatically cuts off at 100% then trickle charges to maintain it at full charge, which is fine unless it is charged overnight frequently. Lithium-ion batteries are stressed when they stay at full charge for a prolonged period. It causes them to lose their capacity significantly in the long term. Its effect is very little but accumulates over time and leads to shorter and shorter battery capacity. <a href=""http://batteryuniversity.com/learn/article/how_to_prolong_lithium_based_batteries"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Source</a></p>
<p><strong>17. What does Charby Sense's auto cut off actually do?</strong></p>
<p>Charby Sense stops the power supply from entering your phone entirely after it cuts off at full charge, instead of letting it recharges when the battery level drops. This prevents the battery to be kept at its full-state-of-charge for a prolonged period, which hastens the battery degradation.</p>
<p><strong>18. Why does it take around 30 minutes for Charby Sense to auto cut off?</strong></p>
<p>Your phone isn’t fully charged after it displays 100% charge level. It takes about 30 minutes or more after that to reach full charge (limit set by the manufacturer).</p>
<p><strong>19. Why do you need a laptop Charge Booster?</strong></p>
<p>Charging your phone on a laptop port is much slower because your phone is charging in data transfer mode, whereby your phone automatically requests for a lower charging current. What Charby Sense’s Charge Booster button does is disabling data transfer to allow your phone to automatically request for higher current, thus doubling the charging speed. Macbook from Apple however usually produces a higher charging current as compared to other laptop brands, hence the charging speed will only increase slightly when Charge Booster is activated.</p>
<p><strong>20. Does Charge Booster work on wall chargers or power banks? </strong></p>
<p>Charge Booster mode is only applicable when your device is plugged into a USB port with data transfer capabilities such as those on laptops or car chargers. Charby Sense will have the fastest charging mode set by default when it is used on USB port which does not have data transfer capabilities such as those on wall chargers or power banks.</p>
<p><strong>21. Why does the charging seem to have slowed down after I activated Charge Booster?</strong></p>
<p>Some smartphone companies integrated proprietary charging system into their devices. The device uses the data lines of the cable to communicate with a wall charger to enable fast charging capabilities. Pressing the button on Charby Sense cuts off the data communication capabilities, hence the proprietary wall charger will not deliver its maximum speed. Therefore, we advise against pressing the charge booster button when you are using a wall charger or power bank. </p>

<p style=""text-align: center;""><b>FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><b><br/></b></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><b>How does Pipsqueak</b>®<b> work?</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Pipsqueak® pairs to an existing smartphone just like a Bluetooth headset, so you can route calls from your smartphone to Pipsqueak® allowing your child to talk on their own phone instead of yours.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><b>Who is Pipsqueak</b>®<b> meant for?</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Pipsqueak® was designed specifically for kids aged 3-8+, who are too young for their own cellular device but are ready to have an age-appropriate mobile device suitable for their desires and needs.  Kids who want to connect (to mommy, daddy, gramma, etc.) and kids who want to have a mobile device to call their very own will Love having their very own Pipsqueak®!</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><b>Does Pipsqueak</b>®<b> have a SIM card?</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">No. Pipsqueak® does not have a SIM card, nor cellular antenna. It does not have its own phone number or mobile service plan either, incoming and outgoing calls are simply routed through the parents mobile number and wireless plan.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><b>It has no cellular antenna – does that mean it’s safer than a cell phone?</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Some experts suggest Bluetooth is a safer alternative than cellular, because Bluetooth devices have an electro-magnetic frequency output of around 0.001 watts/kg, which is less than one thousandth the SAR limit for cell phones as set by the FDA and FCC (source: <a href=""http://www.cancer.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.cancer.org</a>). Experts further contend that parents should exercise caution when handing children cellular/wifi enable devices because children are more susceptible than adults to any potentially harmful effects of strong EMF radiation due to the thinness of their skulls (2 millimeters) and developmental stage of their brains.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><b>Does Pipsqueak</b>®<b> require its own calling plan?</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">No. Pipsqueak® is an extension device, so it’s connected through the parent’s existing smartphone and calling plan. There are no additional fees, calling plan, nor contract to use Pipsqueak®. When Pipsqueak®  is receiving or making a call, the call is hosted on the parent’s smartphone.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><b>Can anyone call my child / can my child dial out to anyone?</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Through the Yip Yap smartphone app, you can set Approved Callers so that only those calls/callers will be able to route to Pipsqueak®, and your child will only be able to initiate a call out to those Approved Callers when you have approved them to be connected to your smartphone.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><b>What if I don’t have the app?</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">The app is free to download, but you still have control without it. Calls will only route to Pipsqueak® when Pipsqueak® is paired to your smartphone. If you don’t want Pipsqueak® to receive or make calls, simply unpair it in your phone’s Bluetooth settings.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><b>How will I know if Pipsqueak</b>®<b> is connected to Bluetooth?</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">The light bands on the sides of Pipsqueak®  will glow blue when it’s connected to Bluetooth. You can also see that it is paired in the Bluetooth menu of your smartphone.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><b>Does Pipsqueak</b>®<b> work with any phone?</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Pipsqueak® should work with any phone equipped with Bluetooth calling capability.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><b>Where will Pipsqueak</b>®<b> work?</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Pipsqueak® can receive a call anywhere within Bluetooth range of the parent’s smartphone to which it’s paired. Depending on the environment that’s around 50 feet, but could be closer or farther. So, around the house, in the backseat of the car, out shopping, etc.  Range only matters when the child is taking a phone call on Pipsqueak®. Pipsqueak® does not have to be in range of the parent’s device when the child is playing with Pipsqueak’s® other features such as games, playing music, sounds, copycat and watching videos.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><b>What else does Pipsqueak</b>®<b> do?</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">When your child is not using it to talk, Pipsqueak® is built for play!</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">MUSIC – Pipsqueak® is also a Music Player capable of holding hundreds of songs, with a standard 3.5mm audio jack to plug in headphones (the Pipsqueak® starter Bundle comes packaged with earbuds!), or listen out-loud through the built-in speakers.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">GAMES – Pipsqueak® can play games. A couple games will come pre-loaded on Pipsqueak® and you can download even more games from YipYap.com.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">PHOTOS &amp; VIDEOS – Pipsqueak® can store and display photos and play videos on its color LCD display.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">COPYCAT – Pipsqueak® has a CopyCatTM record and playback function, so a child can record their voice and play it back with funny voice-altering effects.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">CUSTOMIZE IT – Pipsqueak® has removable covers so a child can change the color and theme of their Pipsqueak® as often as they want. They can go from Red to Pink, Pirates to Ninjas or Fairies to Princesses, allowing Pipsqueak® to easily keep up with their changing interests. They can also change out the photo Yip Chips on the back to a picture of their pet, best friend, favorite character, or even a photo of them self.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">SOUNDS – Play and customize the sounds on your Pipsqueak® ® ® using the soundboard. If you want your Pipsqueak® to ‘<i>zoom’</i> like a racecar, you can add and change sound effects easily.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><b>Will Pipsqueak</b>®<b> work with other Bluetooth devices?</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Currently Pipsqueak® is only enabled to connect via Bluetooth to make/receive calls.  In the future Pipsqueak® will be able to connect via Bluetooth to perform other cool features.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><b>Is Pipsqueak</b>®<b> durable?</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Pipsqueak® was designed for kids, so it’s built to take a tumble without breaking.  We’ve beefed up the thickness of the plastics and taken extra measures to makes sure the electronics stay protected while being subjected to the “torture” of a small child.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><b>What’s the battery life?</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">That, of course, depends on how much your child is using it, but it has a big lithium polymer battery and can generally go at least a couple days between charges.  Pipsqueak® recharges quickly with the included USB cable and wall charger. </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><b>How much storage does Pipsqueak</b>®<b> have?</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Pipsqueak® will have at least 2 GB of storage capacity via a “parent-only accessible” micro SD card.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><b>When is Pipsqueak</b>®<b> available?</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">The first mass product run of Pipsqueaks® will be available for customers in May 2016. Yip Yap plans to make small initial production run which should arrive in December 2015.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><b>Where can I buy one?</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Get yours first exclusively on Indiegogo, which is the quickest way to get your hands on a Pipsqueak®. Pipsqueak® will be available in some retailers in the second half of 2016. Sign-up for updates at YipYap.com.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><b>How much does Pipsqueak</b>®<b> cost?</b></p>

Kids Love It, Parents Approve It.

With Pipsqueak, your child now has an age-appropriate device for learning, playing games and connecting with loved ones.
  


Giving your child their own Pipsqueak puts just the right amount of connected technology in their hand while you - the parent/guardian - maintains full control. 
  


Pipsqueak was designed with safety in mind, which our adult smartphones do not adequately address. 

In addition to the fun and educational features that parents/kids love, we’ve created a safety-first platform for children to interact on their own device, with limitations that our smartphones do not have.
 

  

No more asking mom or dad to 'play' on their phone...




Instead of handing your large, expensive & breakable smartphone to a child's tiny hands, kids can now have their own age-appropriate, kid-sized device!  


Pipsqueak fits perfectly into a child’s smaller hands and is loaded with their favorite features.

 

From games, to talking with friends and family, to listening to music, or watching videos, Pipsqueak is the new go-to gadget for kids.
 
 


  
 
  
Kids can talk on Pipsqueak the same way they would talk on any mobile phone.
 
Pipsqueak gives kids and parents a cost-effective solution for connecting small children to loved ones because it requires no additional phone service or plan - there are no usage fees.


Using Yip Yap’s FREE Smartphone App, parents will be able to create approved caller lists from their contacts and transmit only those approved contacts to Pipsqueak, ensuring their child can never dial out to anyone that hasn’t been parent-approved.



Incoming calls will only be routed from the app to Pipsqueak if they correspond to the approved caller list.  Even if a caller is approved, parents can still choose to block the call from going to Pipsqueak.
 



“Play games on it” is the #1 answer we hear when asking small children what they would do with their own mobile device.

 
With a color LCD display, built-in speakers, plenty of storage and directional keypad, Pipsqueak is perfect for gameplay.

Our launch game, Snake, is a timeless favorite and a throwback to the very earliest days of mobile gaming.
Our goal is to build a robust gaming catalog that will keep children engaged using critical thinking, problem solving and creativity skills (without even realizing it!). 




Pipsqueak is also a Music Player and can hold hundreds of songs!

Listen out loud through the built-in speakers or plug in the headphones.

 
Load Pipsqueak up with your child’s favorite MP3’s and watch them sing and dance throughout their day, adding a personalized soundtrack to their adventures. 
Pipsqueak comes with at least 2G of removable micro SD memory, which users can upgrade the memory card to 4, 8, 16 or 32G. 




Watch videos, animated movies, TV shows or videos shot with a parent’s phone.

Videos loaded to Pipsqueak are automatically rotated to fill the robust and colorful 2.4” TFT display horizontally when played.

Parents can optimize videos to manage file size and match Pipsqueak’s screen size using the free video converter on the Yip Yap website.


 

Kids say the darndest things and often crack themselves (and sometimes parents) up doing it.



They will love recording their own silly messages on CopyCat then altering the playback speed to make their voices sound SSSLLLOOOWWW and DEEEEEEP or speed them up really, really, really fast!  Never-ending fun!
 

The soundboards are a great way for children to use Pipsqueak to enhance their creative playtime by playing sound effects, voice clips, music clips and any other type of audio file they might want. 
Soundboards themes will be available to download on the Yip Yap website.
 
 

“My Pipsqueak is cooler than yours!”
 
Because we all know that what kids love this month will be old news next month, we created multiple ways for kids to personalize their Pipsqueaks easily.
 

They’ll love swapping out the front and back cover-plates, Yip Chips (photo discs), and Dangles (charms) on the outside to complement what we hope will turn into a huge selection of digital media content on the inside.
 

Within our ecosystem, the Yip Yap Yuniverse ™ we’ve already begun developing custom games, soundboards, videos, wallpapers and screen savers. 

Our vision is that the explorable area of the YY Yuniverse™ is ever-expanding, but always only accessible to kids with approval.  

  

Pipsqueak offers parents peace-of-mind knowing Yip Yap has built an age-appropriate platform that they control.

FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS

How does Pipsqueak® work?
Pipsqueak® pairs to an existing smartphone just like a Bluetooth headset, so you can route calls from your smartphone to Pipsqueak® allowing your child to talk on their own phone instead of yours.
Who is Pipsqueak® meant for?
Pipsqueak® was designed specifically for kids aged 3-8+, who are too young for their own cellular device but are ready to have an age-appropriate mobile device suitable for their desires and needs.  Kids who want to connect (to mommy, daddy, gramma, etc.) and kids who want to have a mobile device to call their very own will Love having their very own Pipsqueak®!
Does Pipsqueak® have a SIM card?
No. Pipsqueak® does not have a SIM card, nor cellular antenna. It does not have its own phone number or mobile service plan either, incoming and outgoing calls are simply routed through the parents mobile number and wireless plan.
It has no cellular antenna – does that mean it’s safer than a cell phone?
Some experts suggest Bluetooth is a safer alternative than cellular, because Bluetooth devices have an electro-magnetic frequency output of around 0.001 watts/kg, which is less than one thousandth the SAR limit for cell phones as set by the FDA and FCC (source: www.cancer.org). Experts further contend that parents should exercise caution when handing children cellular/wifi enable devices because children are more susceptible than adults to any potentially harmful effects of strong EMF radiation due to the thinness of their skulls (2 millimeters) and developmental stage of their brains.
Does Pipsqueak® require its own calling plan?
No. Pipsqueak® is an extension device, so it’s connected through the parent’s existing smartphone and calling plan. There are no additional fees, calling plan, nor contract to use Pipsqueak®. When Pipsqueak®  is receiving or making a call, the call is hosted on the parent’s smartphone.
Can anyone call my child / can my child dial out to anyone?
Through the Yip Yap smartphone app, you can set Approved Callers so that only those calls/callers will be able to route to Pipsqueak®, and your child will only be able to initiate a call out to those Approved Callers when you have approved them to be connected to your smartphone.
What if I don’t have the app?
The app is free to download, but you still have control without it. Calls will only route to Pipsqueak® when Pipsqueak® is paired to your smartphone. If you don’t want Pipsqueak® to receive or make calls, simply unpair it in your phone’s Bluetooth settings.
How will I know if Pipsqueak® is connected to Bluetooth?
The light bands on the sides of Pipsqueak®  will glow blue when it’s connected to Bluetooth. You can also see that it is paired in the Bluetooth menu of your smartphone.
Does Pipsqueak® work with any phone?
Pipsqueak® should work with any phone equipped with Bluetooth calling capability.
Where will Pipsqueak® work?
Pipsqueak® can receive a call anywhere within Bluetooth range of the parent’s smartphone to which it’s paired. Depending on the environment that’s around 50 feet, but could be closer or farther. So, around the house, in the backseat of the car, out shopping, etc.  Range only matters when the child is taking a phone call on Pipsqueak®. Pipsqueak® does not have to be in range of the parent’s device when the child is playing with Pipsqueak’s® other features such as games, playing music, sounds, copycat and watching videos.
What else does Pipsqueak® do?
When your child is not using it to talk, Pipsqueak® is built for play!
MUSIC – Pipsqueak® is also a Music Player capable of holding hundreds of songs, with a standard 3.5mm audio jack to plug in headphones (the Pipsqueak® starter Bundle comes packaged with earbuds!), or listen out-loud through the built-in speakers.
GAMES – Pipsqueak® can play games. A couple games will come pre-loaded on Pipsqueak® and you can download even more games from YipYap.com.
PHOTOS & VIDEOS – Pipsqueak® can store and display photos and play videos on its color LCD display.
COPYCAT – Pipsqueak® has a CopyCatTM record and playback function, so a child can record their voice and play it back with funny voice-altering effects.
CUSTOMIZE IT – Pipsqueak® has removable covers so a child can change the color and theme of their Pipsqueak® as often as they want. They can go from Red to Pink, Pirates to Ninjas or Fairies to Princesses, allowing Pipsqueak® to easily keep up with their changing interests. They can also change out the photo Yip Chips on the back to a picture of their pet, best friend, favorite character, or even a photo of them self.
SOUNDS – Play and customize the sounds on your Pipsqueak® ® ® using the soundboard. If you want your Pipsqueak® to ‘zoom’ like a racecar, you can add and change sound effects easily.
Will Pipsqueak® work with other Bluetooth devices?
Currently Pipsqueak® is only enabled to connect via Bluetooth to make/receive calls.  In the future Pipsqueak® will be able to connect via Bluetooth to perform other cool features.
Is Pipsqueak® durable?
Pipsqueak® was designed for kids, so it’s built to take a tumble without breaking.  We’ve beefed up the thickness of the plastics and taken extra measures to makes sure the electronics stay protected while being subjected to the “torture” of a small child.
What’s the battery life?
That, of course, depends on how much your child is using it, but it has a big lithium polymer battery and can generally go at least a couple days between charges.  Pipsqueak® recharges quickly with the included USB cable and wall charger. 
How much storage does Pipsqueak® have?
Pipsqueak® will have at least 2 GB of storage capacity via a “parent-only accessible” micro SD card.
When is Pipsqueak® available?
The first mass product run of Pipsqueaks® will be available for customers in May 2016. Yip Yap plans to make small initial production run which should arrive in December 2015.
Where can I buy one?
Get yours first exclusively on Indiegogo, which is the quickest way to get your hands on a Pipsqueak®. Pipsqueak® will be available in some retailers in the second half of 2016. Sign-up for updates at YipYap.com.
How much does Pipsqueak® cost?
Pipsqueak® will retail starting at $129, but be on the lookout for special pricing on bundles and multi-packs for our first Pipsqueak® users!

This is not your basic jump starter kit.
 It has multiple ports for a variety of devices to plugin. Smart phones, tablets, laptops, and other electronic items. We have even included ports to plugin most international devices too. This jump starter features an innovative low-profile design for easy storage in your vehicle or garage, and it keeps you safe with visual and audible reverse polarity alarms to warn against an improper connection to the battery terminals. It also comes equipped with an ultra-bright area light for easy use at night, and the cable clamps store easily on the unit.

<p><strong>Inspired by rock climbing ropes, Belay Cords are a more durable and personalized way to charge your Apple or Android product. Belay on!</strong></p>

<h1>Problem</h1>
<p>You are a unique, creative, and fun individual but for some reason, your phone charging cord falls short of that. </p>
<p>We love our phones, and if you use them as often as we do, charging is not something you do in the privacy of your home. We charge everywhere! In the car, at work, in class, coffe shop anyone?, in the airport, in the library... And besides fighting for available outlets, we have two major problems with the current phone charging cables:</p>
<p>1. <em>Design</em>. Phone cases are the accessories that get all the attention these days. Why not share some love with the charging cord? Traditional iPhone charging cords wear out easily over time, get dirty, and only come in plain white colors. iPhone cords do come in a variety of colors from third party vendors, but some of these cords are of inferior quality and sometimes look, feel, or act cheaply. </p>
<p>2. <em>Quality. </em>Tired of broken cords and interrupted syncing? We sure are! The joint where the cable connects to the USB or 30-pin connector tends to wear out quickly unless reinforced with a third party product. When charging your iPhone, sometimes a small movement of the cord will stop your device in the middle of syncing or charging. </p>

<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>I am an internet entrepreneur from Chapel Hill, North Carolina. I studied CAD, 3D Modeling, and Product Design in college. Now, with my team of developers I create products that enhance life and add to the way we interact with technology. We have already developed several iPhone gadgets, and today we are putting an end to boring with Belay Cords! </p>
<div class=""template asset""><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/000/255/144/7c417b82dd4310cce1f396d7ffdd45ff_large.jpeg?1352597481"" src="""" style=""""/></div>
<p>Why does every charging cable have an outer rubber housing? They get dirty quickly, wrap themselves into horrendous knots in your purse, and breakdown with day to day use. Why not protect your cables with something more durable, more colorful, and more....You.</p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.belaycords.com/img/slide2_3.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>We re-thought the current design of the iPhone charging cables and after many iterations, landed on an amazing product. We borrowed the design structure from rock climbing ropes, traditionally used to belay climbers while moving up a rock face. The design lended itself perfectly to what we were trying to accomplish. A more durable, sleeker, and reinforced iPhone charging cable. We don't recommend taking it with you for climbing, but it would fit right in.</p>

<p>The optional 6 foot length allows you the versatility of connecting your iPhone to the wall, without connecting yourself as well. Easily use the cable as a bedside charger. And because of the longer length, you can set the alarm every evening without hassle.</p>
<p>With a simple knot you can shorten Belay Cords for use next to your computer. For the more organized, tie Belay Cords to the loop of your bag and show off your smart investment.</p>

<p><strong>We will offer a range of basic color and color blends (or you could suggest your own). All funderse will have the ability to vote for their favorite. The top 4 will be manufactured and you can select which ones you would like to receive. If we raise more than our goal, we'll add stretch goals and manufacture more color options!</strong></p>
<p>We've come up with some great color schemes for Belay Cords. But we wanted to leave the final choice to our funders. We'll post all of the color options on our Indiegogo page, and you can even suggest your own by messaging us with a description or picture of your color preference. Once the project is complete, we'll allow every funder to vote for their favorite color combinations. The top 4 will then become our initial color choices for the launch. Each backer may then chose which of the most popular Belay Cords they would like to receive for their pledge. And if we pledge more than our goal, we'll increase the amount of colors for production.</p>

<h1>What's the plan?</h1>
<p>Production is ready. The molds are made, the electronics and manufacturing is sourced. We need you to select the best colors, then we'll start the engines. </p>
<p>Our goal is to keep manufacturing of Belay Cords in the United States, but this will require a good amount of funding. Our back up plan is to use an overseas manufacturer. </p>
<p><strong>Project timeline:</strong></p>
<p>Project Funding Begins - day 0</p>
<p>Project Funding Ends - 45 days</p>
<p>Color Preferences are voted on and chosen - 10 days</p>
<p>Manufactured -30 days</p>
<p>Packaged - 5 days</p>
<p>Shipped - 5 days</p>
<p>Total - 95 days</p>
<p>You'll receive your Belay Cords by February, at the latest. We hope to get you this exceptional product, in your favorite color, by January.</p>

</div></div>","Presenting Belay Cords
Inspired by rock climbing ropes, Belay Cords are a more durable and personalized way to charge your Apple or Android product. Belay on!

 
 
 

Problem
You are a unique, creative, and fun individual but for some reason, your phone charging cord falls short of that. 
We love our phones, and if you use them as often as we do, charging is not something you do in the privacy of your home. We charge everywhere! In the car, at work, in class, coffe shop anyone?, in the airport, in the library... And besides fighting for available outlets, we have two major problems with the current phone charging cables:
1. Design. Phone cases are the accessories that get all the attention these days. Why not share some love with the charging cord? Traditional iPhone charging cords wear out easily over time, get dirty, and only come in plain white colors. iPhone cords do come in a variety of colors from third party vendors, but some of these cords are of inferior quality and sometimes look, feel, or act cheaply. 
2. Quality. Tired of broken cords and interrupted syncing? We sure are! The joint where the cable connects to the USB or 30-pin connector tends to wear out quickly unless reinforced with a third party product. When charging your iPhone, sometimes a small movement of the cord will stop your device in the middle of syncing or charging. 

Broken Cord

Charging Not Supported
Solution
I am an internet entrepreneur from Chapel Hill, North Carolina. I studied CAD, 3D Modeling, and Product Design in college. Now, with my team of developers I create products that enhance life and add to the way we interact with technology. We have already developed several iPhone gadgets, and today we are putting an end to boring with Belay Cords! 

Why does every charging cable have an outer rubber housing? They get dirty quickly, wrap themselves into horrendous knots in your purse, and breakdown with day to day use. Why not protect your cables with something more durable, more colorful, and more....You.

We re-thought the current design of the iPhone charging cables and after many iterations, landed on an amazing product. We borrowed the design structure from rock climbing ropes, traditionally used to belay climbers while moving up a rock face. The design lended itself perfectly to what we were trying to accomplish. A more durable, sleeker, and reinforced iPhone charging cable. We don't recommend taking it with you for climbing, but it would fit right in.

2x Charging
We can make Belay Cords the best charging accessory and can create them in an amazing number of color combinations! 

Tie Belay Cords to your bag
Our design reinforce the iPhone charging cable, making it more durable, keep it looking clean, and the result is even more flexible than traditional charging cords.

Shown in Orange
The optional 6 foot length allows you the versatility of connecting your iPhone to the wall, without connecting yourself as well. Easily use the cable as a bedside charger. And because of the longer length, you can set the alarm every evening without hassle.
With a simple knot you can shorten Belay Cords for use next to your computer. For the more organized, tie Belay Cords to the loop of your bag and show off your smart investment.

Shown in black and green braided
We will offer a range of basic color and color blends (or you could suggest your own). All funderse will have the ability to vote for their favorite. The top 4 will be manufactured and you can select which ones you would like to receive. If we raise more than our goal, we'll add stretch goals and manufacture more color options!
We've come up with some great color schemes for Belay Cords. But we wanted to leave the final choice to our funders. We'll post all of the color options on our Indiegogo page, and you can even suggest your own by messaging us with a description or picture of your color preference. Once the project is complete, we'll allow every funder to vote for their favorite color combinations. The top 4 will then become our initial color choices for the launch. Each backer may then chose which of the most popular Belay Cords they would like to receive for their pledge. And if we pledge more than our goal, we'll increase the amount of colors for production.

What's the plan?
Production is ready. The molds are made, the electronics and manufacturing is sourced. We need you to select the best colors, then we'll start the engines. 
Our goal is to keep manufacturing of Belay Cords in the United States, but this will require a good amount of funding. Our back up plan is to use an overseas manufacturer. 
Project timeline:
Project Funding Begins - day 0
Project Funding Ends - 45 days
Color Preferences are voted on and chosen - 10 days
Manufactured -30 days
Packaged - 5 days
Shipped - 5 days
Total - 95 days
You'll receive your Belay Cords by February, at the latest. We hope to get you this exceptional product, in your favorite color, by January.
Vote for your favorite color!

Creating a healthier work environment
 

Not Like Any Other Laptop or Tablet StandCrouching towards your device causes fatigue and, often, serious eye strain. The new all-in-one X-STAND creates a more comfortable working environment, eliminating additional fatigue and eyestrain, while at the same time boosting energy and concentration levels.Studies show sitting at work for extended periods of time can lead to severe health issues and decline in overall productivity. Standing, for just thirty minutes each day, is proven to combat these health concerns, boost energy levels and improve concentration during and after the workday.   X STAND in Standing Mode with SmartphoneDesks with both high and low positions or an adjustable high/low desk are expensive and often non-portable solutions to these problems.

<h3>OrthoGraph on Android - we should do it together</h3>
<p></p>
<p>Have you ever tried to create a floor plan of an existing room or building? If yes, then you know it's a hard work. The first sketch of your floor plan doesn't look like the numbers tell you, measurement errors are realized only later at home or in your office, and that is also typical that you forget to measure something, that would be really necessary to have to plan your move, renovation; create your CAD drawing or to do the energy audit of a building.</p>
<p>If you are a carpenter, then you know how important it is to have an exact drawing, as all angles and distances strongly count to succeed with your job.</p>
<p>As a painter how easy it were to have painting surface calculations with just a tap, even on site? You could give your proposal direct there, at the same moment you have finished with your measurements.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><b>All this is there in OrthoGraph Architect today, but only on iPad.</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><b>With this campaign we want to make it available for Android users too!</b></p>
<p>OrthoGraph Architect is available on the iPad for more than 2 years, and we have requests continuously from the beginning to make it available on droid too. We have even made a poll on our Facebook page, and the result was the same, so we decided to fulfill this demand.</p>
<p>The 4 most important unique features besides the many others that OrthoGraph has are the following:</p>
<p></p>
<ol>
<li>
<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Intuitive way of drawing rooms like you were with pencil and paper</span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Through measures the room shape gets exact and alive instantly</span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">The results can be exported to many CAD formats or watched live in 3D</span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Surface calculations are there for you, all right on the spot</span><br/>
</li>
</ol>
<p></p>

<h3>Android and other platforms</h3>We spent a lot of time to find out the best way of developing OrthoGraph Architect Android version. In the past half year we have made some researches, small trial projects and we clarified out the right way of creating the Android version. It is also clear for us that if we set near deadlines - that’s what our customers would expect from us - then we will need external help and resources from Android professionals. Without this boost we need 1-1.5 years to do the development with our internal resources.<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Meanwhile, in addition to the above investigation we got many requests from you to use OrthoGraph on further platforms like Windows 8 (e.g. running OrthoGraph on Windows Surface or any tablet/notebook) too.</p>
<p></p>
<p>After lots of internal and external discussions it became clear for us, that we can do it, and will need a common environment to develop and run OrthoGraph on Android and on iOS platforms too.</p>
<p><b>If we get enough support from you, then we will be able to create also the Windows 8 touchscreen version of OrthoGraph.</b></p>
<p>This is a large work, so f<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">or this we need your support!</span></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>The development</h3>
<p></p>
<p>The new version will not be a simple replacement of the current OrthoGraph Architect product, but it will hold many new features in addition to the current functionality. Such will be a stronger, more professional 3D rendering engine (including lights, shadows), 3D editing (maybe not in the first release), multi-texture materials on objects and walls (you can e.g. color the wall meanwhile you choose tiles on that), and we plan to build in a customizable object library. Latter will not only be filled up with objects made by us, but we will look also for partners to help in that, and we would like to open it up to our users too, so that you can create your own 3D objects with most popular 3D graphics software that can save to our chosen standard format. This format will be selected to be supported widely by popular 3D graphics software.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/99639/files/20130927112908-furniturex600.png?1380306548"" src="""" style=""""/></p>We have started developing OrthoGraph from scratch - meanwhile proceeding with the development of the current product -, and when it is ready, then we will replace the current product with the new one. This new version will be released on the following platforms: iOS (iPad), Android tablets and if we get enough support from you, then as a stretch goal also on Windows 8 (with touchscreen support).<p></p>This will not happen for the first time that we develop OrthoGraph from scratch. We have done it once for Windows Mobile, and as you can see, we have done it again 3 years ago for the iPad version. We have reached a certain level of the software, that we won't let decrease. The funding we get goes simply to one direction, we hire an experienced development team for helping in the programming of the new version.<p></p>
<p>This project is huge and long, we will need roughly 8 Months for this development. The more support from you we get, the more people we can hire for the project, so it might take less time depending on the success of this campaign.</p>
<p>The first 1.5 Month will be the planning and prototyping. In this phase we will do those parts of the development that will let us adding all the features later, in jargon we can say that we will create the engine, the strong substructure of the system.</p>
<p>In the next phase we will create an Alpha version in two phases, before Christmas we will present you a reduced functionality stable version - only on focusing on the most important core features -, and later we will create a full functionality Alpha version. This will end in March. One month later we will have a fully functional Beta version for final compatibility testing.</p>
<p>Beta testing will need time. In this phase we will try not to change any of the features implemented, but make them stable, fast and reliable. We plan to finish with the product at the end of May.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>What will you get with backing us?</h3>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>First of all you will get OrthoGraph Architect on your Android faster, or if you don not have Android, but you have iPad, you will get your OrthoGraph Architect on your iPad with better performance, strongly enhanced rendering and bright new features. <b>The question is not if you get it (sure you will), but the speed of development. The sooner we get support from you and the more we get, the earlier we will finish!</b></p>

We have different licenses (subscription or never expiring full functionality), and all for different platforms. Having a subscription means you are entitled to use the full functionality of OrthoGraph Architect for a given period of time meanwhile you can use OrthoGraph Cloud features, like storing your data on our hosted servers with versioning (Cloud Pro subscription) and use the teamwork and file versioning features simply on all files stored by us (Cloud Business subscription). The full licenses are also on a reduced price, but it is even unsure yet whether there will be time unlimited license outside of this campaign. If there will be, then we will sell it over $200 in the future, but we will focus on subscription based licenses. Please pick your choice or choices now.</span><br/><p></p>
<p>Thirdly, we also have beta tester and consultation seats, so you can make your impact on the final product. You can feel yourself as part of the team, somebody, who helped a dream come true.</p>
<p>Last but not least we also have stretch goals.</p>
<p>We will create the Android version of OrthoGraph Architect in approximately 1 year, the question is the speed, and whether it will be available on other platforms too, as quality and minimum features are not negotiable.</p>
<p>If we reach the 25K limit, then of course you all get the perk chosen, and we will make the development in 8 Months. We will update you with videos, and the ones who purchased that perk also get the beta versions starting from very early phases to contribute as beta testers.</p>
<p>If we stretch to 50K, then we will create the Windows 8 version focusing on Microsoft Surface Pro, and its touch screen functionality.</p>

<p></p>
<p>OrthoGraph Architect Android version will be developed independently whether this campaign succeeds or not, we already started the development. The time frame and the destination platforms are the only question. Our development record can ensure you that we are able and dedicated to do the job, our only limitation is the resources we have. If you need OrthoGraph Architect on Android or other new platforms, or you just want the new features this development enables, then support this campaign. </p>
<p>If you cannot do it, or you find OrthoGraph Architect a great idea but you don't need the product, then please spread the word, share it, tweet it, blog it. The more people know about us, the closest we are to our common goal: </p>

Have you ever tried to create a floor plan of an existing room or building? If yes, then you know it's a hard work. The first sketch of your floor plan doesn't look like the numbers tell you, measurement errors are realized only later at home or in your office, and that is also typical that you forget to measure something, that would be really necessary to have to plan your move, renovation; create your CAD drawing or to do the energy audit of a building.
If you are a carpenter, then you know how important it is to have an exact drawing, as all angles and distances strongly count to succeed with your job.
As a painter how easy it were to have painting surface calculations with just a tap, even on site? You could give your proposal direct there, at the same moment you have finished with your measurements.
All this is there in OrthoGraph Architect today, but only on iPad.
With this campaign we want to make it available for Android users too!
OrthoGraph Architect is available on the iPad for more than 2 years, and we have requests continuously from the beginning to make it available on droid too. We have even made a poll on our Facebook page, and the result was the same, so we decided to fulfill this demand.
The 4 most important unique features besides the many others that OrthoGraph has are the following:



Intuitive way of drawing rooms like you were with pencil and paper


Through measures the room shape gets exact and alive instantly


The results can be exported to many CAD formats or watched live in 3D


Surface calculations are there for you, all right on the spot




Watch the video how it works on iPad today, and maybe on Android tomorrow:




See OrthoGraph Architect's 1st steps guide on Prezi for details about how it works!
Android and other platformsWe spent a lot of time to find out the best way of developing OrthoGraph Architect Android version. In the past half year we have made some researches, small trial projects and we clarified out the right way of creating the Android version. It is also clear for us that if we set near deadlines - that’s what our customers would expect from us - then we will need external help and resources from Android professionals. Without this boost we need 1-1.5 years to do the development with our internal resources.

Meanwhile, in addition to the above investigation we got many requests from you to use OrthoGraph on further platforms like Windows 8 (e.g. running OrthoGraph on Windows Surface or any tablet/notebook) too.

After lots of internal and external discussions it became clear for us, that we can do it, and will need a common environment to develop and run OrthoGraph on Android and on iOS platforms too.
If we get enough support from you, then we will be able to create also the Windows 8 touchscreen version of OrthoGraph.
This is a large work, so for this we need your support!




The development

The new version will not be a simple replacement of the current OrthoGraph Architect product, but it will hold many new features in addition to the current functionality. Such will be a stronger, more professional 3D rendering engine (including lights, shadows), 3D editing (maybe not in the first release), multi-texture materials on objects and walls (you can e.g. color the wall meanwhile you choose tiles on that), and we plan to build in a customizable object library. Latter will not only be filled up with objects made by us, but we will look also for partners to help in that, and we would like to open it up to our users too, so that you can create your own 3D objects with most popular 3D graphics software that can save to our chosen standard format. This format will be selected to be supported widely by popular 3D graphics software.

We have started developing OrthoGraph from scratch - meanwhile proceeding with the development of the current product -, and when it is ready, then we will replace the current product with the new one. This new version will be released on the following platforms: iOS (iPad), Android tablets and if we get enough support from you, then as a stretch goal also on Windows 8 (with touchscreen support).This will not happen for the first time that we develop OrthoGraph from scratch. We have done it once for Windows Mobile, and as you can see, we have done it again 3 years ago for the iPad version. We have reached a certain level of the software, that we won't let decrease. The funding we get goes simply to one direction, we hire an experienced development team for helping in the programming of the new version.
This project is huge and long, we will need roughly 8 Months for this development. The more support from you we get, the more people we can hire for the project, so it might take less time depending on the success of this campaign.
The first 1.5 Month will be the planning and prototyping. In this phase we will do those parts of the development that will let us adding all the features later, in jargon we can say that we will create the engine, the strong substructure of the system.
In the next phase we will create an Alpha version in two phases, before Christmas we will present you a reduced functionality stable version - only on focusing on the most important core features -, and later we will create a full functionality Alpha version. This will end in March. One month later we will have a fully functional Beta version for final compatibility testing.
Beta testing will need time. In this phase we will try not to change any of the features implemented, but make them stable, fast and reliable. We plan to finish with the product at the end of May.

What will you get with backing us?


First of all you will get OrthoGraph Architect on your Android faster, or if you don not have Android, but you have iPad, you will get your OrthoGraph Architect on your iPad with better performance, strongly enhanced rendering and bright new features. The question is not if you get it (sure you will), but the speed of development. The sooner we get support from you and the more we get, the earlier we will finish!

Secondly, you get the perk you have chosen, which can be a license, a feature, some or a combination of above - on strongly discounted price compared to the released version. We have different licenses (subscription or never expiring full functionality), and all for different platforms. Having a subscription means you are entitled to use the full functionality of OrthoGraph Architect for a given period of time meanwhile you can use OrthoGraph Cloud features, like storing your data on our hosted servers with versioning (Cloud Pro subscription) and use the teamwork and file versioning features simply on all files stored by us (Cloud Business subscription). The full licenses are also on a reduced price, but it is even unsure yet whether there will be time unlimited license outside of this campaign. If there will be, then we will sell it over $200 in the future, but we will focus on subscription based licenses. Please pick your choice or choices now.
Thirdly, we also have beta tester and consultation seats, so you can make your impact on the final product. You can feel yourself as part of the team, somebody, who helped a dream come true.
Last but not least we also have stretch goals.
We will create the Android version of OrthoGraph Architect in approximately 1 year, the question is the speed, and whether it will be available on other platforms too, as quality and minimum features are not negotiable.
If we reach the 25K limit, then of course you all get the perk chosen, and we will make the development in 8 Months. We will update you with videos, and the ones who purchased that perk also get the beta versions starting from very early phases to contribute as beta testers.
If we stretch to 50K, then we will create the Windows 8 version focusing on Microsoft Surface Pro, and its touch screen functionality.
Other Ways You Can Help Us

OrthoGraph Architect Android version will be developed independently whether this campaign succeeds or not, we already started the development. The time frame and the destination platforms are the only question. Our development record can ensure you that we are able and dedicated to do the job, our only limitation is the resources we have. If you need OrthoGraph Architect on Android or other new platforms, or you just want the new features this development enables, then support this campaign. 
If you cannot do it, or you find OrthoGraph Architect a great idea but you don't need the product, then please spread the word, share it, tweet it, blog it. The more people know about us, the closest we are to our common goal: 
OrthoGraph Architect on Android - let's make it together!


FAQ1. Will I get my perk if the campaign doesn't reach its goal?
Sure you will! We need the campaign only to accelerate the development, and by the stretch goals to step forward to other platforms too. Don't forget: these perks contain a large discount too, so get them as soon as you can!

2. I already have an iPad version. Will I get the new version on my iPad?
Sure you will! We love our users and we would like to honor them with the new version as soon as possible!

3. The version I purchase will run on all platforms?
No, The iPad version will run on iPad, the Android version will run on Android and that's true for all versions that we will be able to create.
4. How can I participate in the beta testing program?

<h1>How was the Phone Monkey born?</h1>
<div>
<p>My 5 year old son was playing with an old Gumby character and my phone and said “Look Daddy, Gumby is hugging your phone!”</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<p><img alt=""Phone Monkey Gumby"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.my-fancave.com/Phone-Monkey-Gumby.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Then Zack Brown (Lead Product Designer) and I started talking about creating a Gumby type character to hold a Smartphone. (Yes, Zack Stretcherz was named after Zack Brown!) That was the first a-ha moment, ‘We could make a fun, flexible way to hold a Smartphone on a desk.” We decided to create an animal shape. </p>
<p>A couple of days later came some more unexpected inspiration: a friend complained that he almost got in an accident trying to use the GPS function on his phone and asked if I had a way to mount it in his car.</p>
<p><img alt=""Phone Monkey Gumby in the Car"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.my-fancave.com/Phone-Monkey-Gumby-car.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>We started experimenting and put model ""Phone Gumby"" to the test. We took him for a rest drive in the car in several locations, on the dash, in cup holders, in the ash tray. Then I hit my head on the rear-view mirror… What if I hang it from the mirror? How can we hang it, an arm, a leg, or a tail? - ooooo a long flexible tail! Now what kind of animal would hang from a mirror with a long flexible tail? A MONKEY! Really, what other choice is there? </p>
<div>
<p>Then we started designing the Phone Monkey. Zack (Brown, not Stretcherz) is very talented in CAD. We skipped the napkin stage went directly to CAD drawings. (Zack prefers Rhino for his CAD software)</p>
</div>
<p><img alt=""Phone Monkey Early Ideas"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.my-fancave.com/Phone-Monkey-early-ideas-1.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span>On the first try Zack came up with something that we thought would work. With the preliminary designs in hand, it was time to create a 3D model to test the design. BOING Designs has a Dimension 768 SST 3D printer. It prints by laying down ABS in layers upon layers to build up a 3D part. It squirts slightly melted ABS out of a nozzle in much the same manner as a cake decorator squeezes frosting out of a tube. As soon as the string of ABS touches the existing material it sticks and cools. Acetone or ABS solvent can be used to smooth the surface and create a better bond between layers.</span></p>
<p><span> </span></p>
<p><span><img alt=""Phone Monkey in 3D Printer"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.my-fancave.com/Phone-Monkey-in-printer.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></span></p>
<p><span> </span></p>
<p><span><span>The first test is to check the over all geometry and the size of the Phone Monkey. </span></span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><img alt=""Phone Monkey Prototype #1"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.my-fancave.com/Phone-Monkey-Prototype-1.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span>ABS isn't flexible, so to simulate a flexible tail we taped on a thick wire. </span></p>
<p><span> </span></p>
<p><img alt=""Phone Monkey Testing #1"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.my-fancave.com/Phone-Monkey-Prototype-1-testing.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><span> </span></p>
<div>
<p>We learned several things from the printed prototype:</p>
<p>·  The upper body and arms are great. We don’t need any major changes.</p>
<p>·  The legs should be longer to allow for a wider variety of phones. To keep the same overall size we need to decrease the length of the lower torso.</p>
<p>·  Adding a heel would allow for a more stable stance when the Phone Monkey is holding a phone on a flat surface.</p>
<p>·  The tail can be mounted to the hip to remove the bump on the back. (Purely aesthetic)</p>
<p>·  The tail needs to be much longer. The current short tail would not be able to hold onto thicker rear-mirrors mounts in many of today’s cars. It also adds additional flexibility (pun unintended) for mounting to a wider variety of objects. </p>
</div>
<p>Zack quickly made the changes and we printed a new version of the Phone Monkey.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img alt=""Phone Monkey Prototype #2"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.my-fancave.com/Phone-Monkey-Prototype-2.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span><span>We tested the tail using another wire. </span></span></p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><img alt=""Phone Monkey #2 testing"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.my-fancave.com/Phone-Monkey-Prototype-2-testing.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span>Here’s a side by side comparison of the Phone Monkey two prototypes.</span></p>
<p><span> </span></p>
<p><span><img alt=""Phone Monkey Prototype Comparision"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.my-fancave.com/Phone-Monkey-Prototype-comparison.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></span></p>
<p> </p>
<div>
<p>All the changes worked exactly as intended. The longer tail provided enough reach to wrap around thicker rear-view mirrors. The longer legs will allow mounting to a wider variety of phones and it looks better too!</p>
<p>It was time to send the files to the factory. We specified high quality silicone over-molded on a steel skeleton. To ensure durability, the tail would be welded to the skeleton. </p>
<p>To our amazement, the very first samples came back perfect. Anyone who has experience developing products knows that this is a rare occasion. They were so perfect that I used the first samples for the images of this Kickstarter project. We are ready to give the go ahead to finalize the mold and get ready for production. We just need your help, please check out the rewards to the right.</p>

<h1>How will we manufacture and deliver the Phone Monkey?</h1>
<div>
<p>Several years ago I was fortunate enough to meet Jay Hanson. He has over 25 years of experience manufacturing overseas. Jay has factory contacts for just about every type of material you can imagine. If he doesn't have the capability for a certain project, he’ll find the right factory to produce it. He helped BOING! Designs manufacture our products.<a href=""http://www.boingdesigns.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.boingdesigns.com</a> Over the years, Jay and I have created a friendship from a working relationship. We have recently begun to help inventors and companies who need manufacturing assistance bring their ideas to market. (We can help you too! See the bottom reward at the right if you need manufacturing assistance.)</p>
<p>Jay recently returned from a trip to China where he visited several factories including the factory which will produce the Phone Monkey. The factory can produce hundreds of thousands of Phone Monkeys; capacity is not an issue.</p>
<p>BOING! Designs has already contacted several companies for help in distributing the Phone Monkey Kickstarter project. We have settled on two companies, one for international and one for domestic:</p>
<p>For domestic backers we plan to utilize a Beaverton, Oregon based company PrintSync, who has the capability to quickly fulfill mass mailings to the entire country. Last year they processed a friend’s Kickstarter project with over 4000 pieces sent to 2500 unique USA addresses in less than 48 hours. <a href=""http://www.printsync.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.printsync.com</a></p>
<p>For international backers we have experience with DirectLink. They are owned by the Swedish postal service. I've received good feedback from others who have used DirectLink for their Kickstarter projects. The options offered for creating labels by DirectLink is much more efficient than is offered by the USPS. If you've ever tried to do a bulk international shipment with the USPS, you know what I’m saying. Here’s an article about DirectLink. <a href=""http://www.ecommercebytes.com/cab/abu/y213/m05/abu0334/s02"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""http://www.ecommercebytes.com/cab/abu/y213/m05/abu0334/s02"">http://www.ecommercebytes.com/cab/abu/y213/m05/abu0334/s02</a></p>
<p>Both PrintSync and DirectLink can take the spreadsheet created by Kickstarter with backer addresses and automatically create shipping labels.</p>
<p>We feel like we have addressed all issues with manufacturing and distribution, but something can always surprise us. </p>
<p>Patent Pending.</p>

Now what kind of animal would hang from a mirror with a long flexible tail? A MONKEY! Really, what other choice is there? 

Then we started designing the Phone Monkey. Zack (Brown, not Stretcherz) is very talented in CAD. We skipped the napkin stage went directly to CAD drawings. (Zack prefers Rhino for his CAD software)


 
On the first try Zack came up with something that we thought would work. With the preliminary designs in hand, it was time to create a 3D model to test the design. BOING Designs has a Dimension 768 SST 3D printer. It prints by laying down ABS in layers upon layers to build up a 3D part. It squirts slightly melted ABS out of a nozzle in much the same manner as a cake decorator squeezes frosting out of a tube. As soon as the string of ABS touches the existing material it sticks and cools. Acetone or ABS solvent can be used to smooth the surface and create a better bond between layers.
 

 
The first test is to check the over all geometry and the size of the Phone Monkey. 
 

 
ABS isn't flexible, so to simulate a flexible tail we taped on a thick wire. 
 

 

We learned several things from the printed prototype:
·  The upper body and arms are great. We don’t need any major changes.
·  The legs should be longer to allow for a wider variety of phones. To keep the same overall size we need to decrease the length of the lower torso.
·  Adding a heel would allow for a more stable stance when the Phone Monkey is holding a phone on a flat surface.
·  The tail can be mounted to the hip to remove the bump on the back. (Purely aesthetic)
·  The tail needs to be much longer. The current short tail would not be able to hold onto thicker rear-mirrors mounts in many of today’s cars. It also adds additional flexibility (pun unintended) for mounting to a wider variety of objects. 

Zack quickly made the changes and we printed a new version of the Phone Monkey.
 

 
We tested the tail using another wire. 
 
 

 
Here’s a side by side comparison of the Phone Monkey two prototypes.
 

 

All the changes worked exactly as intended. The longer tail provided enough reach to wrap around thicker rear-view mirrors. The longer legs will allow mounting to a wider variety of phones and it looks better too!
It was time to send the files to the factory. We specified high quality silicone over-molded on a steel skeleton. To ensure durability, the tail would be welded to the skeleton. 
To our amazement, the very first samples came back perfect. Anyone who has experience developing products knows that this is a rare occasion. They were so perfect that I used the first samples for the images of this Kickstarter project. We are ready to give the go ahead to finalize the mold and get ready for production. We just need your help, please check out the rewards to the right.

 
How will we manufacture and deliver the Phone Monkey?

Several years ago I was fortunate enough to meet Jay Hanson. He has over 25 years of experience manufacturing overseas. Jay has factory contacts for just about every type of material you can imagine. If he doesn't have the capability for a certain project, he’ll find the right factory to produce it. He helped BOING! Designs manufacture our products.www.boingdesigns.com Over the years, Jay and I have created a friendship from a working relationship. We have recently begun to help inventors and companies who need manufacturing assistance bring their ideas to market. (We can help you too! See the bottom reward at the right if you need manufacturing assistance.)
Jay recently returned from a trip to China where he visited several factories including the factory which will produce the Phone Monkey. The factory can produce hundreds of thousands of Phone Monkeys; capacity is not an issue.
BOING! Designs has already contacted several companies for help in distributing the Phone Monkey Kickstarter project. We have settled on two companies, one for international and one for domestic:
For domestic backers we plan to utilize a Beaverton, Oregon based company PrintSync, who has the capability to quickly fulfill mass mailings to the entire country. Last year they processed a friend’s Kickstarter project with over 4000 pieces sent to 2500 unique USA addresses in less than 48 hours. www.printsync.com
For international backers we have experience with DirectLink. They are owned by the Swedish postal service. I've received good feedback from others who have used DirectLink for their Kickstarter projects. The options offered for creating labels by DirectLink is much more efficient than is offered by the USPS. If you've ever tried to do a bulk international shipment with the USPS, you know what I’m saying. Here’s an article about DirectLink. http://www.ecommercebytes.com/cab/abu/y213/m05/abu0334/s02
Both PrintSync and DirectLink can take the spreadsheet created by Kickstarter with backer addresses and automatically create shipping labels.
We feel like we have addressed all issues with manufacturing and distribution, but something can always surprise us. 
Patent Pending.

<h3>Why Atomotion?</h3>
<p>We developed a new 3D printer called the Apparatus ARC using a full feedback servo setup with brushless DC motors and inexpensive magnetic encoder sensors. To do this we needed a fast microcontroller with a lot of IO. The options for making a prototype were either not capable of making the whole system, not flexible enough to handle different motor types, or just too expensive to prototype with.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1472714428/o8vprwrtczqpalgatusa.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>We made a limited prototype using a less expensive development board and then designed our own custom board with more IO available to create our full prototype.</p>
<p>What. A. Pain.</p>
<p>This inspired our design for the Atomotion system. It is the toolbox for building and developing more intelligent automated stuff.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://static1.squarespace.com/static/57a5c4a820099e8bfa293d92/t/57c7f98abe6594a0d115841e/1472723354242/"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>We've finalized the V1 system design, that's it above. There are four different types of boards: Controller, Backplane, Function Module, and Power. You might notice we divided up the Backplane and Power from our last design. This simplifies the Backplanes and will make it more simple and cheaper to use something like an ITX power supply for the input.</p>
<p>We've given enough power and space in the system to do some pretty amazing things. The layout allows for a system that uses up to 60A@35V DC, that's around 2kW of power to motors, laser diodes, lights, heaters, or anything else electronic. To handle that, we've thought through things like cooling and how it might fit inside your creations. </p>

</div></div>","Why Atomotion?
We developed a new 3D printer called the Apparatus ARC using a full feedback servo setup with brushless DC motors and inexpensive magnetic encoder sensors. To do this we needed a fast microcontroller with a lot of IO. The options for making a prototype were either not capable of making the whole system, not flexible enough to handle different motor types, or just too expensive to prototype with.

We made a limited prototype using a less expensive development board and then designed our own custom board with more IO available to create our full prototype.
What. A. Pain.
This inspired our design for the Atomotion system. It is the toolbox for building and developing more intelligent automated stuff.

We've finalized the V1 system design, that's it above. There are four different types of boards: Controller, Backplane, Function Module, and Power. You might notice we divided up the Backplane and Power from our last design. This simplifies the Backplanes and will make it more simple and cheaper to use something like an ITX power supply for the input.
We've given enough power and space in the system to do some pretty amazing things. The layout allows for a system that uses up to 60A@35V DC, that's around 2kW of power to motors, laser diodes, lights, heaters, or anything else electronic. To handle that, we've thought through things like cooling and how it might fit inside your creations. 

On one side we have all of the connections to the Function Modules along with USB-A host ports (on the Pro Controller) and the programming micro USB port (mbed compatible) for the main controller.

On the other side we have all of the ports like power and USB-B. The Pro Controller has ethernet and HDMI as well.
The casing is shown for the 8 Module configuration with a Pro Controller and 10A 5.5mm barrel plug. The optional 40mm fans are there for those applications that the Function Modules run hot. 
8 Module System Size (60mm Deep)4 Module System Size (60mm Deep)

OpenCNX

 
The interface between modules is the peanut butter and jelly in our sandwich of automation technology. We've taken a lot of time thinking through how to give the most flexibility and usable power so that the system will be both easy to use and extremely flexible. Both the 34 pin and 164 pin connections between the different modules are already up on Github. We have even put together a template for the Function Modules so that you can quickly design your own in KiCad. We will continue to release more of the system into open source licensing, either immediately when it is ready to share or we will have bounties for some of the more complex things like the controller modules.

<p><strong>What is Scout?</strong></p>
<p>Scout is the world’s best charger.  It features a built-in wall charger, built-in cables, quick-charging USB Port, and proprietary intelligent charging technology.  All this in an incredibly slim design that weighs in at less than 9 ounces.</p>
<p><strong>What is the difference between Scout Max and Scout Wireless?</strong></p>
<p>The Scout Max features a built-in wall charger, 9 independent charging cords that tuck neatly away, a universal USB port, additional micro USB charging port, and packs a 10000mAh battery for charging on the go. </p>
<p>The Scout Wireless has a 5000mAh battery and adds wireless charging to the mix, giving you an incredibly convenient way to charge. </p>
<p><strong>Why did you develop Scout?</strong></p>
<p>These days, we all have so many devices and cords and chargers. Everything you buy seems to need more.  We got sick of the clutter and hassle and developed a single charger that could keep all our devices charged up. </p>
<p><strong>Is the Scout a concept or are there working prototypes?  </strong></p>
<p>We have fully functional Scout prototypes are ready to move into mass production now.  Here is an unformatted video of the Scout prototype in action.  </p>
<p><strong>Can I charge my device while the Scout is plugged into the wall?  </strong></p>
<p>Absolutely, when plugged into the wall, Scout will simultaneously charge the internal power bank and any connected device.  There is also a micro USB input to charge Scout if an outlet isn’t handy or convenient. </p>
<p><strong>Why do I need Scout?</strong></p>
<p>The Scout is an incredibly powerful charging platform that is easy to use, eliminates extra cords &amp; chargers, and can go with you wherever you travel.</p>
<p><strong>Why are you crowdfunding?</strong> </p>
<p>Scout is a finished product, however we need your help to lower the cost for mass production. We also want to make sure our earliest supporters get the best pricing available, which is why the earlier you purchase, the better the deal!</p>
<p><strong>Will this carry all the necessary regulatory approvals such as ETL, FCC, and others?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, the Scout will be ETL certified and is FCC, RoHS, and CE compliant.  As an added layer of protection, we will be testing the internal battery to UL standards.</p>

<p>Our first full production of Micro-Phone has sold out - That's right we have sold out our complete first production of 5,000 Micro-Phones thanks to your overwhelming support and contributions. We want to thank all our early adopters for believing in our campaign and supporting us in the way you have.<br/><br/>As a result of this the team at Indiegogo have allowed us to extend our campaign for another 30 days, which will allow us to build more momentum for Micro-Phone and our new model Micro-Phone + Tracker.<br/><br/>All contributors' who have supported our campaign up to 30 June will receive their Perks from the first batch, which will be shipped out between mid August and early September. <br/><br/>Contributors from 1 July will receive their Perks from early October.<br/><br/></p>
<h3>Enhancements</h3>
<p>The amazing thing about Crowd Funding is that it allows you our valued contributor's to give us feedback about the features and functions you want in a phone, even one as small as Micro-Phone. Well, we have been listening and we have been looking at all your comments, suggestions and ideas to come up with some neat enhancements. <br/><br/>You said you wanted to be able to connect to earphones, so we have included this function in the software. It will require an adaptor (we have added one in our Perks for $5 if you don't already have one) so you can use your phone hands free with any 3.5mm earphones (like the ones for your iPhone).<br/><br/>You said you wanted vibration, so we have incorporated a vibrator in the phone for you. It took a little work due to the size of the phone and the size of the vibration motor but we have managed to do it.<br/><br/>You said you wanted multi language support so we have upgraded the software to include 10 languages. We are currently working on the languages we can incorporate in the phone at present based on the geographical location of contributors. We will update you on this once we have a confirmed list of languages we will support.<br/><br/></p>
<h3 style=""color: #ff0000;"">Hot News</h3>
<p>We will be adding one more model to the range - Micro-Phone + Tracker. Micro-Phone + Tracker will utilize a Bluetooth 4.0 BLE module to allow users to track the phone within a small radius using Bluetooth. We will be incorporating this module into the phone and users will be able to download an App to connect to Micro-Phone from their smart phone.<br/><br/>To reduce the costs associated with development we are currently talking with a handful of companies who already have a Bluetooth 4.0 BLE device and App on the market. Once we have determined which company we will partner with we will have a license agreement for users of Micro-Phone to connect to that App to use our Tracker.<br/><br/></p>

Micro-Phone Campaign Update
Our final pre production sample has been completed and approved and we have added some images below for everyone to get a sneak peak at it. There was an issue with the font style and size but we have resolved this so the final production will be correct. As this is the pre production version the keypad (being hand made) is not 100% even but the full production version will have the same raised finish as the 3D design models.
The icon's for our menu interface have been finalized and they are below. 
It's a Phone, It's a Tracker, It's a Locator
Our first full production of Micro-Phone has sold out - That's right we have sold out our complete first production of 5,000 Micro-Phones thanks to your overwhelming support and contributions. We want to thank all our early adopters for believing in our campaign and supporting us in the way you have.As a result of this the team at Indiegogo have allowed us to extend our campaign for another 30 days, which will allow us to build more momentum for Micro-Phone and our new model Micro-Phone + Tracker.All contributors' who have supported our campaign up to 30 June will receive their Perks from the first batch, which will be shipped out between mid August and early September. Contributors from 1 July will receive their Perks from early October.
Enhancements
The amazing thing about Crowd Funding is that it allows you our valued contributor's to give us feedback about the features and functions you want in a phone, even one as small as Micro-Phone. Well, we have been listening and we have been looking at all your comments, suggestions and ideas to come up with some neat enhancements. You said you wanted to be able to connect to earphones, so we have included this function in the software. It will require an adaptor (we have added one in our Perks for $5 if you don't already have one) so you can use your phone hands free with any 3.5mm earphones (like the ones for your iPhone).You said you wanted vibration, so we have incorporated a vibrator in the phone for you. It took a little work due to the size of the phone and the size of the vibration motor but we have managed to do it.You said you wanted multi language support so we have upgraded the software to include 10 languages. We are currently working on the languages we can incorporate in the phone at present based on the geographical location of contributors. We will update you on this once we have a confirmed list of languages we will support.
Hot News
We will be adding one more model to the range - Micro-Phone + Tracker. Micro-Phone + Tracker will utilize a Bluetooth 4.0 BLE module to allow users to track the phone within a small radius using Bluetooth. We will be incorporating this module into the phone and users will be able to download an App to connect to Micro-Phone from their smart phone.To reduce the costs associated with development we are currently talking with a handful of companies who already have a Bluetooth 4.0 BLE device and App on the market. Once we have determined which company we will partner with we will have a license agreement for users of Micro-Phone to connect to that App to use our Tracker.

<p>The Photo Center is a national and regional platform for the photographic arts, serving the community through education programs, exhibitions, and public facilities.  It is the region's only organization offering intensive ten-week courses, a nationally accredited certificate program, workshops, a full schedule of exhibitions, and gallery programs.  Our programs are open to all:  the photo-curious, amateurs, and professional artists and photographers.  <a href=""http://www.pcnw.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.pcnw.org</a></p>
<p><strong>What We Desperately Need:</strong></p>
<p>10 new Desktop Computers with monitors.</p>
<p>1 new server for file storage, backup, and network management.</p>
<p>Indiegogo.com fundraising goal: 22,000</p>
<p><span>All equipment and technology needs and have been specified by our friends at Microsoft, who are generously donating over 50 hours of their personal time to help us get everything set up professionally!</span></p>
<p>Technology has made all of our lives so much easier over the past few years.  Imagine if you still had to engage a print bureau every time you wanted to make a new brochure or print a report, or if all of your professional correspondence went through postal mail.  Imagine if every time you went to open your email program or an accounting software package, it took 1 or 2 minutes to finish opening. Or if saving and printing attachments from your email took longer than it takes to get a cup of coffee.</p>
<p><strong>Now, imagine it's not just affecting you, but everyone you work with.  Welcome to life in the administrative offices of Photo Center NW.  Here, the average age of the desktop system is 7 years old, and the server is approaching 6 years old and some of our software is approaching its 10 year anniversary.</strong></p>
<p>In years past, we have had many generous donations of used systems. Used systems, however, come with their own hidden costs that directly affect the Photo Center. For this hardware refresh, we would like to plan and build an office productivity system that will enable us to work efficiently for at least the next 3-5 years.</p>
<p><strong>Why It Matters</strong></p>
<p>In addition to offering educational courses and workshops, a gallery exhibiting regional and nationally acclaimed artists, and community outreach programs, the Photo Center provides traditional darkrooms, studios, digital labs, project sponsorship and offers a peer-to-peer creative environment to hundreds of emerging and professional artists annually.  We are the hub of photographic activity in Seattle and beyond, and in order to sustain the organization, we must become even more efficient in our day-to-day work which supports the greater artistic community.</p>
<p>So, please consider the next time you open your email program - if you were to spend 60-120 seconds in quiet reflection before getting to work, to spend that time thinking of Photo Center NW  - and what your donation could do to help someone else get right to work.<strong> We are pumped to do this project and hope you are too!</strong>  Every donation matters - thank you for your consideration.</p>
<p>If by chance we exceed our fundraising goal:  WE HAVE GONE TO HEAVEN! Actually, if we exceed our goal, all funds will be used exclusively to support Photo Center programs. <strong>For some fun entertainment from the Photo Center Staff, please watch our video :  indiegogo.com/pcnw</strong></p>
<p><strong>P.S. Don't forget to check with your company on matching dollars!</strong></p></div>","About the Photo Center
