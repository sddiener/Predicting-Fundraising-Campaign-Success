<li>
<strong>Improving children’s dental health</strong>. Currently, it’s shocking. World Health Organization research finds that 60-90% of children worldwide have tooth decay and further research reports that chronic gingivitis – leading to periodontal disease and tooth loss – is common in children. We don’t want painful futures for any child. Most people, especially children, find brushing their teeth boring. Brushies improves oral hygiene by making brushing fun. Children brush better for longer, in line with American Dental Association recommendations.</li>
<li>
<strong>Freeing up parents and keeping their dental costs down</strong>. Some of the Brushies team are parents, so we know what a pain it is to get our children to brush their teeth properly. We’re tired of brushtime struggles and we don’t want to stand over our kids twice a day to make sure they brush properly. So built in to Brushies is a monitoring system so parents can check how well their kids are brushing.</li>
</ol><h3>And what’s our long-term aim for Brushies?</h3><p>We want Brushies to be affordable, available and used in every household that uses smart devices.</p><p> </p><h2>Where are we at?</h2><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1491999525/upnxyjatlueol0j1zmei.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/>  <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1491393005/xroctyz84yjsxml23c6w.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>We know that building hardware is hard.

<strong>My Story: Honesty, Kindness, Equality, and Respect</strong></p><p>Growing
 up in my house included trips to the dermatologist.  In our family and 
even with the extended relatives there were always, cancers, 
pre-cancers, sun burns…  My mom has had several cancers removed from her
 face and arms.  It is always tough to see grafted skin slowly healing 
on loved ones.  Most of the older family members had skin that showed 
signs of aging after years of sun damage from outdoor work or simply by 
enjoying outdoor activities. Like the rest of my family, I have had one 
cancer removed and dozens of pre-cancers frozen off and this is likely 
only the beginning for me.  Being a runner and nature lover I spend a 
lot of time outside and while I cover up and slather on sunblock my skin
 still gets damaged. </p><p>I am a
 Molecular biologist, and I made it a point to learn what was happening 
to our skin in order to help by finding a solution to this skin problem.
 I wanted to embrace my family’s principles of honesty, kindness, 
equality, and respect when I thought about this solution</p><p>I
 came up with an easy to use, protective and rejuvenating anti-aging 
cream formulation using the latest science in conjunction with the best 
ingredients from all over the world.  While this was made with my family
 in mind, Vital 3 Derm Anti-aging Cream is for anyone who wants to 
protect their skin from future damage and to reverse the signs of aging.
 Anyone can feel calm and peaceful about their skin.</p><ul>

</div><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>
</div><p><strong>Curtis Phillipson</strong>
 started his scientific career as a biology student interning in labs at
 the University of California at San Diego and The Scripps Research 
Institute.  After graduating from UCSD with a BS in Biology, he 
continued working at the Scripps Research Institute in the 
Neuropharmacology Department.  When an opportunity opened up at The 
Kewalo Marine Research Institute in Hawaii he jumped on a plane to 
follow a dream. Following his time in Hawaii, Curtis worked at 
Aquabounty Technologies, Ibis Biosciences and Abbott Labs.  During this 
time Curtis received his MS in Cellular and Molecular Biology and an MBA
 from San Diego State University.  Curtis’ experience as a molecular 
biologist includes 15 years and counting and he has been involved with 
several publication and patents throughout his career.  As Curtis 
watched him mom and other family members develop cancers and signs of 
aging Curtis turned his attention to the skin care world to develop 
revolutionary products to help all those in need.

Our New Patent Pending Ingredient </h3><div>
</div><p>Rejuvicol TM - The Collagen Protection System<br/><br/>The
 Rejuvicol Collagen Protection System is unique to Vital 3 Derm and 
cannot be found in any other anti-aging cream.  In Essence it is an 
Antibody that protects the breakdown of collagen.  Collagen is 
constantly being broken down and being made in the skin. As we age, the 
balance shifts more towards breakdown of collagen. Rejuvicol can 
directly inhibit the breakdown of collagen in the skin, shifting the 
balance of breakdown and production towards that of more youthful skin. 
How exciting is this? It’s revolutionary!</p><div>
</div><ul>
</ul><h4>Some background science on Collagen and Elastin</h4><ul>
</ul><div>
</div><div>
</div><p><strong>Collagen</strong><br/><br/>Collagen
 is an essential protein that lends support to the skin and gives it 
structure. It is one of the building blocks of the skin. The breakdown 
of collagen leads to fine lines and wrinkles. This happens with age and 
with sun exposure.

</div><h4>Elastin
          </h4><div>
</div><div>
</div><p>Elastin is an essential 
protein that gives the skin its elasticity, or the ability to “bounce 
back”. The gradual loss of elastin with aging and sun exposure leads to 
saggy skin.  Vital 3 Derm products not only contain Rejuvicol to protect collagen but they contain dill extract which has been shown to protect elastin as well.</p><p><br/></p><div>

</div><h2>Rejuvicol is an Antibody - why?</h2><div>
</div><div>
<p>Antibodies are a 
normal part of our immune system and have the amazing ability to 
pinpoint a specific target to bind to.  They were first referenced in 
1890 when Emil von Behring and Kitasato Shibasaburo found that a 
substance in blood could neutralize infections.  Since then Antibodies 
have been studied extensively and used in research and therapeutics.  In
 1986 the first antibody was used clinically to help patients from 
rejecting transplants.  Antibodies now have been used to treat several 
diseases including cancer and infections such as respiratory viruses.  
In 2013 Vital 3 Derm was approved to use Rejuvicol in skin care products
 and now we can add aging as another potential target of Antibodies.  Below is a timeline of antibody use in therapeutics.  For a larger copy go to <a href=""http://www.vital3derm.com/vital3derm#/antibody/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.vital3derm.com/vital3derm#/antibody/</a></p>

<h3>Testimonial</h3>
<p>""
 Hello Everyone.  A few months back I started using Vital 3 Derm 
Anti-Aging Cream.  When I tried the product I was very impressed.  The 
cream was very rich and mousse like in texture.  It went on thick and 
then immediately absorbed into my skin.  My skin felt smooth soft and 
subtle yet firm.  I use the cream morning and night and was able to wear
 it under my foundation and make up without having any of it shift or 
look oily.  I have used the cream for several months now and I 
absolutely love it.  Throughout these months I have noticed my skin 
looking and feeling more firm as well as having a more even complexion. 
 The product has great ingredients.  It's certainly a healthier way to go
 about taking care of your skin.  I recommend Vital 3 Derm as a must try
 and if you are going to start, then you need to stick with it for at 
least 3 months to get the full effect.  You won't be disappointed.""

<h3>Testimonial</h3>
<p>“At
 first I was a bit worried that the cream will be greasy. But that 
turned out not to be the case at all, as it rubs in really well and 
feels pretty light. I have used it for about a month now, and I feel 
like my skin is tighter and smoother. I will definitely keep using it, 
and have recommended it to other people as well!”  Irene Y.  (Scientist)</p>

<p>If we fail to achieve our goals we
will use our funding to start the Research and Development of the cleanser and
serum and then use the rest to make another batch of the original Vital 3 Derm
Anti-aging cream.  If we don’t reach our
level to develop the new products then three Vital 3 Derm  anti-aging cream samples will be sent instead
of the cleanser and 1 jar of vital 3 derm anti-aging cream will be sent out
instead of the serum.</p>
</li> </ul><div> </div> <div> </div><h1>The Impact</h1><div> </div><ul> <li>
<p>By helping to fund this project you are helping to develop a
new class of cosmetics that use antibodies to help deliver results in the
anti-aging skin care field.  This has
never been done before and could help to make really effective ingredients for
generations to come.  </p>
</li>
</ul><div> </div> <div> </div><h1>Risks &amp; Challenges</h1><div> </div><p> </p><div>
</div><p>Rejuvicol is a new ingredient and significant research and
development is needed in order to optimize the best delivery mechanism.  If things need to be modified in order to
enhance delivery of rejuvicol into the skin I can accomplish this.  We can try using liposomes, skin perforation,
or smaller peptides that target the areas we are interested in.</p><div>
</div><p>  Other
hurdles involve creating a formulation that the is aesthetically pleasing and
with my partners I feel confident in the ability to accomplish this.  Especially since one of our perks will
involve help from everyday people like you.  <br/></p><div>

Vital 3 Derm –
 With our Vital 3 Derm Anti-Aging Cream we created a product that 
effectively combats the effects of aging. It moisturizes, protects, and 
rejuvenates the skin. Moisturizing agents include Sodium Hylaluronate, 
Aloe and many other effective ingredients. Protection is accomplished by
 our exclusive ingredient Rejuvicol, which protects collagen form being 
broken down. With this we combine vitamins, anti-oxidants, botanicals 
(including dill extract) to protect your skin on several different 
levels. To rejuvenate your skin we include peptides and the building 
blocks of collagen to help stimulate the production of collagen and 
other important proteins. This new unique formula provides the latest 
and most advanced Anti-Aging cream available.









My Story: Honesty, Kindness, Equality, and RespectGrowing
 up in my house included trips to the dermatologist.  In our family and 
even with the extended relatives there were always, cancers, 
pre-cancers, sun burns…  My mom has had several cancers removed from her
 face and arms.  It is always tough to see grafted skin slowly healing 
on loved ones.  Most of the older family members had skin that showed 
signs of aging after years of sun damage from outdoor work or simply by 
enjoying outdoor activities. Like the rest of my family, I have had one 
cancer removed and dozens of pre-cancers frozen off and this is likely 
only the beginning for me.  Being a runner and nature lover I spend a 
lot of time outside and while I cover up and slather on sunblock my skin
 still gets damaged. I am a
 Molecular biologist, and I made it a point to learn what was happening 
to our skin in order to help by finding a solution to this skin problem.
 I wanted to embrace my family’s principles of honesty, kindness, 
equality, and respect when I thought about this solutionI
 came up with an easy to use, protective and rejuvenating anti-aging 
cream formulation using the latest science in conjunction with the best 
ingredients from all over the world.  While this was made with my family
 in mind, Vital 3 Derm Anti-aging Cream is for anyone who wants to 
protect their skin from future damage and to reverse the signs of aging.
 Anyone can feel calm and peaceful about their skin.












My background



Curtis Phillipson
 started his scientific career as a biology student interning in labs at
 the University of California at San Diego and The Scripps Research 
Institute.  After graduating from UCSD with a BS in Biology, he 
continued working at the Scripps Research Institute in the 
Neuropharmacology Department.  When an opportunity opened up at The 
Kewalo Marine Research Institute in Hawaii he jumped on a plane to 
follow a dream. Following his time in Hawaii, Curtis worked at 
Aquabounty Technologies, Ibis Biosciences and Abbott Labs.  During this 
time Curtis received his MS in Cellular and Molecular Biology and an MBA
 from San Diego State University.  Curtis’ experience as a molecular 
biologist includes 15 years and counting and he has been involved with 
several publication and patents throughout his career.  As Curtis 
watched him mom and other family members develop cancers and signs of 
aging Curtis turned his attention to the skin care world to develop 
revolutionary products to help all those in need.

processes, cutting edge scientific research and nature's most effective 
ingredients to create and deliver the best anti-aging products on the 
Market. 









Our products are not only cruelty free they are also parabens free!





















Our New Patent Pending Ingredient 
Rejuvicol TM - The Collagen Protection SystemThe
 Rejuvicol Collagen Protection System is unique to Vital 3 Derm and 
cannot be found in any other anti-aging cream.  In Essence it is an 
Antibody that protects the breakdown of collagen.  Collagen is 
constantly being broken down and being made in the skin. As we age, the 
balance shifts more towards breakdown of collagen. Rejuvicol can 
directly inhibit the breakdown of collagen in the skin, shifting the 
balance of breakdown and production towards that of more youthful skin. 
How exciting is this? It’s revolutionary!

Some background science on Collagen and Elastin


CollagenCollagen
 is an essential protein that lends support to the skin and gives it 
structure. It is one of the building blocks of the skin. The breakdown 
of collagen leads to fine lines and wrinkles. This happens with age and 
with sun exposure.
        













(above - a picture of collagen on a molecular level, below  - a picture showing what happens to collagen and the skin as we age)          

Elastin
          

Elastin is an essential 
protein that gives the skin its elasticity, or the ability to “bounce 
back”. The gradual loss of elastin with aging and sun exposure leads to 
saggy skin.  Vital 3 Derm products not only contain Rejuvicol to protect collagen but they contain dill extract which has been shown to protect elastin as well.

Rejuvicol is an Antibody - why?

Antibodies are a 
normal part of our immune system and have the amazing ability to 
pinpoint a specific target to bind to.  They were first referenced in 
1890 when Emil von Behring and Kitasato Shibasaburo found that a 
substance in blood could neutralize infections.  Since then Antibodies 
have been studied extensively and used in research and therapeutics.  In
 1986 the first antibody was used clinically to help patients from 
rejecting transplants.  Antibodies now have been used to treat several 
diseases including cancer and infections such as respiratory viruses.  
In 2013 Vital 3 Derm was approved to use Rejuvicol in skin care products
 and now we can add aging as another potential target of Antibodies.  Below is a timeline of antibody use in therapeutics.  For a larger copy go to http://www.vital3derm.com/vital3derm#/antibody/

Testimonial
""I
 really enjoy the smooth creamy texture. Vital 3 Derm Anti-Aging Cream 
was non-oily and felt great on my skin.  After using it my skin felt 
softer""  Erika S.

Testimonial
""
 Hello Everyone.  A few months back I started using Vital 3 Derm 
Anti-Aging Cream.  When I tried the product I was very impressed.  The 
cream was very rich and mousse like in texture.  It went on thick and 
then immediately absorbed into my skin.  My skin felt smooth soft and 
subtle yet firm.  I use the cream morning and night and was able to wear
 it under my foundation and make up without having any of it shift or 
look oily.  I have used the cream for several months now and I 
absolutely love it.  Throughout these months I have noticed my skin 
looking and feeling more firm as well as having a more even complexion. 
 The product has great ingredients.  It's certainly a healthier way to go
 about taking care of your skin.  I recommend Vital 3 Derm as a must try
 and if you are going to start, then you need to stick with it for at 
least 3 months to get the full effect.  You won't be disappointed.""  
Theresa S.  (Actress and Model)



Testimonial
“At
 first I was a bit worried that the cream will be greasy. But that 
turned out not to be the case at all, as it rubs in really well and 
feels pretty light. I have used it for about a month now, and I feel 
like my skin is tighter and smoother. I will definitely keep using it, 
and have recommended it to other people as well!”  Irene Y.  (Scientist)

   What We Need & What You GetContributions and reaching the milestones for the cleanser and serum will give our company a chance to compete and show how well our products really work.   
To develop a new cleanser it will
be $35,000 and to develop a Serum it will be $65,000.  This includes initial formulation research
and development, artwork, packaging including jars and boxes, silk-screening,
and testing.
 
These products that you will be receiving in the perks are
amazing.  They really work and the more
people that try them the more great results I am seeing.  The Vital 3 Derm Anti-aging cream is already
a hit and has shown remarkable results. 
We will use the same formulation process to make the serum even
stronger.  I can’t wait to see what kind
of results we will see with it.  Our cleanser
will be a great complement to these products. 
It will gently cleanse and help protect the face from all of the
environmental toxins and damages.

If we fail to achieve our goals we
will use our funding to start the Research and Development of the cleanser and
serum and then use the rest to make another batch of the original Vital 3 Derm
Anti-aging cream.  If we don’t reach our
level to develop the new products then three Vital 3 Derm  anti-aging cream samples will be sent instead
of the cleanser and 1 jar of vital 3 derm anti-aging cream will be sent out
instead of the serum.
    The Impact  
By helping to fund this project you are helping to develop a
new class of cosmetics that use antibodies to help deliver results in the
anti-aging skin care field.  This has
never been done before and could help to make really effective ingredients for
generations to come.  

   Risks & Challenges  
Rejuvicol is a new ingredient and significant research and
development is needed in order to optimize the best delivery mechanism.  If things need to be modified in order to
enhance delivery of rejuvicol into the skin I can accomplish this.  We can try using liposomes, skin perforation,
or smaller peptides that target the areas we are interested in.
  Other
hurdles involve creating a formulation that the is aesthetically pleasing and
with my partners I feel confident in the ability to accomplish this.  Especially since one of our perks will
involve help from everyday people like you.

<p>We are a family of nomadic boaters. We live on Greater London's rivers and canals on our house boat with Tim the cat. Hana's a passionate holistic birthkeeper - antenatal educator, pregnancy and postnatal yoga instructor, doula and active birth teacher. Lee is a free spirit, visual artist and holistic movement educator. We are both performers and storytellers.</p>
<p>Our campaign is to raise funds for an independent midwife for our first baby's birth. Our ideal is an undisturbed, peaceful, intimate birth between us two, the parents. To make this happen, we would like to establish a relationship with our birth attendant already during pregnancy. An independent midwife delivers prenatal visits in her client's home consistently during baby's gestation. She gets to know the expectant mum - her emotional and physical makeup - very well. Same goes for getting to know the couple's wishes and their birth philosophy, not to mention the topography of their home, especially if it is a house boat.</p>
<p>It's a fully case-load - patient orientated - care. This enables the midwife to be of best service during the birth. In the end, we birth as we live. An independent midwife will also deliver six weeks of postnatal support to the new parents, helping with establishing breastfeeding and making sure all is good.</p>
<p>We feel this service should be available to everyone - by choosing independent midwife now, we are potentially making the service more affordable and more available to other families in the future, thanks to an increased demand for it.</p>
<p>We also believe that the gentlest, most natural, loving and respectful birth possible, helps maximize the baby's potential for being a happiness, activating the love circuit of hormones first, rather than the stress response.</p>
<p>It's important to state, that, yes, it is possible to have a homebirth with the National Health Service in the UK. In reality, however, it's a gamble, especially in an overburdened, busy, understaffed hospitals of London.  These days, we see a turn away from supporting home births. Many homebirthing teams were scrapped, lots of home birthing centres closed and many a dedicated midwife left the system to work on her own. Not all mums are ''allowed'' to have a homebirth either, due to the present selection criteria.</p>
<p>Finally, an NHS homebirth, if one manages to get it, means a team of complete strangers, with unknown set of skills and attitudes, arriving on one's doorstep - making your birth a gamble and increasing the potential for a hospital transfer. Additionally, a boat could be deemed a health risk for the birthing team and we can get a rejection on these grounds.</p>

<h1>The Impact</h1> <p>Elko New Market (ENM) and surrounding communities has limited options for fitness and health in the small community.  After teaching Zumba for over 3 years in ENM as well health coaching, Anna has seen the health &amp; happiness benefit they have brought and wants to be able to reach more people and provide even more of an impact.  Also, Anna loves seeing relationships and friendships formed around positive habits and wants to help create more of this in the community so we can help empower each other!</p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3></h3>
<h1>Risks and Challenges</h1> <p>There is risk involved in opening a fitness studio and health coaching practice in a small community.  There is less of a population base as well as traffic. Although, this is a bit worrying, HappiHaven is passionate about the needs of citizens in ENM and values the community very much.  HappiHaven wants to be able to support the needs of the community, but needs the communities help in order to do so.</p>
<p>Through fundraising, like this, as well as support from the community by being a part of the group fitness, health coaching and workshops through HappiHaven we can, together, make this a successful and lasting place for a stronger, healthier &amp; happier community!</p>

HappiHaven Group Fitness & Wellness, Inc.  is  a community centered organization that has been created with the purpose of bringing greater opportunity of health and happiness to your life. Owner, nurse and health coach, Anna Simon, has a strong belief that happy people are healthier and in order to make healthier choices in ones life, they must first be happier. So, Happiness = Healthiness! Help Happihaven get their feet off the ground and support a cause of happiness in the small town of Elko New Market, MN.  With the help of Triage Wellness Institute, who Happihaven has partnered with, we will be able to provide a large number of health related resources to the community. Also, wellness coaching and retreats extends past the borders of Elko New Market and is available for all!

   
What are we fundraising for?



The upfront costs associated with opening a business can be quite expensive! Even more so, Happihaven has goals to provide all the necessary equipment for group fitness as well as a spacious and beautiful studio, but of course all of this comes with an expense. Happihaven wants to give you really cool stuff for donating to their vision of health and happiness.
The specific reasons for this fundraising site is to help with the cost of rent, marketing and instructor fees over the next 6 months as HappiHaven gets on their feet as well as start up costs associated with opening a business.  This will help us increase our class options and schedule sooner!

<h3>What are the limitations of Quoll products?</h3><p>
From our trials the scanning of the QR code works 100% of the time with all types of QR code scanners, so the only time the information will not be available is when there is no smart phone or tablet with a QR scanner app available, or when there is no phone reception.

</p><h3>What is the crowdfunding purpose?</h3><p>
The purpose of this campaign is to raise community awareness of the availability of a life-saving product. 

Help spread the word to potential wearers and local emergency centers, including hospitals, ambulance, fire departments, police departments and animal shelters. 

The money raised through this crowd funding campaign will help spread the knowledge of this product via internet marketing, Facebook, Pinterest and selected magazines. 

Our crowd funding friends are asked to share the information about Quoll Medical with your local Emergency Response groups’. Please share this crowd funding campaign with those you know. </p><p>

Life is precious and the Quoll has the potential to save lives. During life’s unexpected events everyone needs a way to inform emergency services of their medical history and extensive information is available by scanning the Quoll Pendant or Medi-tag. If responsible people around the world inform their local emergency response groups’ the number of deaths will be drastically reduced and their extended families will be saved the heartache of losing a loved one. 

Word of mouth is the best form of advertising, so spread the word about the Quoll Digital Medical Pendant and this could save the life of a neighbour, or friend or one of your family members.

<p>My name is Kaloian Bozhilov and I am a Yoga teacher. I have been teaching Yoga since 2009 and have started the first ever Yoga classes in our town – Pernik, Bulgaria. We started as a small group of 4-5 enthusiasts and the community quickly grew to more than 100 yogis through the years. We are organizing daily Yoga classes, lectures on Yoga philosophy, Ayurveda seminars, meditations sessions, kirtan events and regular Yoga retreats twice a year.</p>
<p>All this is an integral part of many yogis calendar and we try to provide a quality experience for them.</p>
<p>Our Yoga community might not be big but we are all passionate about what we do. The Yoga studio I teach in has changed the life of many people in Pernik and has created a sense of community and friendship. Unfortunately the building we currently occupy needs some renovation done which is beyond our abilities. We try to create a friendly and cosy environment for our practices but this comes with its price.</p>
<p>We need a support for our renovation plan that will help us continue what we do for the community and the town. Our goal is to help more and more people become aware of their inner potential and express their creativity through Yoga. We kindly ask you for your help. Please donate to the campaign so we can do some urgent renovation, install a new floor heating system and insulate the studio.</p>

</div></div>","The Founder My name is Arezou Aghlara. I have PhD degree in food science and I am the founder and scientist behind RiboBlast. I came up with this idea 2 years ago while I was looking for a sports drink in the market to energize and recover. I was training martial arts everyday as well as yoga, swimming, running and weight training. I could not find anything in the market except the drinks loaded with sugar, caffeine and artificial colours, sweeteners and flavours. That was the moment I decided to change the way people hydrate and recover after exercise.

RiboBlast
RiboBlast is the first all-natural, low calorie, D-ribose based sports drink premix supplemented with vitamins and electrolytes in Canada, at only 10 calories per pack. Each pack in 500-ml water makes a drink with full, rich taste.

Features




2 g bioenergy D-ribose per pack


Good source of vitamins C, B1, B2, B6, B12, nicain and pantothenate


Good source of potassium


Low in sodium


Made with natural sweetener (stevia), flavours and colours

The good taste is guaranteed

Free from: dairy, soy, tree nuts, peanuts, wheat, sulfates, caffeine, central nervous stimulants, preservative, artificial ingredients.




How does RiboBlast work?



Ribose: the only sugar in RiboBlast, is a naturally existing sugar in the body that supplies the body with energy and plays a key role in energy metabolism.


Vitamin B1: releases energy from carbohydrates (ribose).


Vitamin B2, B6, B12: promote energy metabolism and tissue formation.


Sodium and potassium: replaced the electrolytes lost during exercise, keeps the ingested water in the body and generate the action required for muscle contraction.

Who is RiboBlast for?
IT IS FOR EVERYONE!

Athletes and fitness participant: before, during and after exercise for hydration and boost of energy.

People on a diet or a weight control program for a boost of energy.


The Health Impact



Today, there are more than 10 million Canadians living with diabetes or prediabetes.


Six million Canadians are living with obesity.


Do you, your wife, husband, sister, brother, children, friend, etc drink high sugar, high calorie drink after soccer, hockey, gym, swimming, yoga, etc? Don't you think those drinks defeat the purpose of exercising?


Have you seen children and even adults drinking the ""sugar-caffeine"" bomb because of the way they have been marketed and placed in the supermarkets?


Did you know that big corporation have exclusive contracts with all the sports complexes, community centers, park boards, ski resorts, school districts, the catering companies that supplies to schools, etc. to only have their products at those location?

<br/>
<p><i>History:</i></p>
<p> RELïC was born out of pure necessity.  In 2011, my wife and I decided we wanted—no, <i>needed</i> to eat better, and so we started eating Paleo-style. We experienced great success with this change—and just as many struggles.  It soon became clear that we needed help bridging the gap between our Paleo diet and our busy modern lifestyle; it was hard to come by quick meals and snacks that weren’t full of junk.  To make things harder we had strict health requirements: </p>
<ul>
<li>Healthy fats (natural coconut oil) </li>
<li>High-quality, grass-fed whey protein </li>
<li>No artificial colors or preservatives</li>
<li>No flavorings (natural or artificial) </li>
<li>No gluten, soy or grains!</li>
<li>Low sugar</li>
</ul>
<p>...Oh, and it has to taste GREAT too!</p>
<br/><p>With your help we can take the next step. </p>
<p>We have been in the kitchen and consulted with bottling companies, refining our ingredients and nutritional profile.  During the preparation period we worked very closely with experts in the natural food world to make sure that we have the best ingredients to make the best drink for you.</p>
</div>
</div>
<br/><p>We didn't find what we required...so we made it!</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><i>Why:</i></p>
<p>A ready-to-drink shake is a great quick meal; it works on the go, anytime. Unfortunately, there is NOTHING out there in that meets our standards. </p>
<p>On a typical day, the two of us work out at our local CrossFit gym and then rush home to make our post-workout shake. We get out our blender, add our grass-fed whey, water, coconut oil, and some natural ingredients for flavor.  In the process, we make a big mess of the counter-top, blender, and glasses.  , but we could do without the hassle. But, what other option do we have?  Our other option is drinking some of the current drinks out there—drinks made with chemical preservatives, colors, and artificial everything! </p>
<p>Clearly, a high quality, ready-to-drink shake, made with amazing ingredients—and no crap—would make life markedly easier. </p>
<p>Since we were already in the food manufacturing business, we headed into our kitchen to make a drink that we knew would be true to our Paleo diet. <i>Why are we doing this?</i> Because we need it for ourselves, and we know we are not alone. </p>
<p>By living up to the Paleo standard we were able to also help other people with their dietary needs, giving those with allergies, sensitivities, or preferences against gluten, food coloring, and soy access to an easy, healthy and tasty option. After workouts, or anytime you are on the go, you can feel good about drinking our RELïC Paleo Protein Shake!</p>

<br/>
<br/><p>My wife and I have been together for 15 years.  We’ve always had a passion for cooking, and we have come to realize just how much of a difference choosing natural ingredients has in the taste of food, and in how our bodies feel. </p>
<p>A few years ago, right in our own kitchen, we started making hot breakfast cereals with wholesome Paleo ingredients.  We were so happy with what we came up with that we started selling it in local stores, and eventually, in several larger health food markets. After several years of learning about the food industry, we feel that we are ready to continue expanding our product line, which is why we decided to launch RELïC Paleo Protein Shakes.  </p>
<p>Together, we set out to blaze a trail that we hope others will follow. We are committed to making only the finest quality products.</p>
<p>So, where are we now?</p>
<p><i><b>Milestones:</b></i></p>
<ul>
<li>Completed formulation for 2 drink flavors </li>
<li>Preliminary formulation for 1 drink flavor</li>
<li>Finished design for sterile Tetra Pak container </li>
<li>
<i>Completed Tetra Pak compliance: </i><br/>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Our next step is a production run of several thousand drinks at our natural beverage co-packer. Many of these first-run drinks will be shipped to you, our supporters. This run will also enable us to approach grocers and distribution companies with tangible products in hand. </p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1455137007/tmjm0jwwosccge3gcdde.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<div><br/></div>
<br/>
<p><b>                           What We Need &amp; What You Get</b></p>
<p><b>Our first dollar goal/milestone: $25,000</b></p>
<p>This will provide the ingredients and bottling equipment necessary for our preliminary run.  Our supporters will get a portion of drinks from the first run. Additionally, this run lets us start approaching distributors and buying agents with a completed drink to show. </p>
<p>We chose the sterile Tetra Pak container because of its ability to keep natural foods fresh without the addition of preservatives and non-food anti-foaming agents so commonly seen in the market. </p>
<p>Of the $25,200 needed for the first run: </p>
<p>-$5,200 covers ingredients</p>
<p>-$20,000 covers the bottling fee</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1455136939/zsjxwvj5qfzreifqh6s9.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<div><br/></div>
<br/>
<p><b>Second dollar goal/milestone: $110,000 </b></p>
<p>Once we have raised this amount of money, we will be able to bring our first drink to market. While this sounds like a lot of money—and it is—this is a very doable amount and should be easy to sell with just a few small orders.  As we found out, the beverage industry requires large volume orders.  We have completed our Research and Development phase, and now have a finished formula. While many crowdfunding campaigns aim to support little more than an idea, <b>all we need to do is hand the bottling company the check, and in a matter of weeks, you will have helped us give the world its first ready to drink Paleo Protein shake. </b></p>
<p>-$20,000 for ingredients</p>
<p>-$65,000 for the bottling fee</p>
<p>-$25,000 for the Tetra Pak container</p>
<p>If we don’t reach the entire goal for the preliminary run, it would be a little disappointing since we are excited to bring our drink to the world.  Yet and still, if our dollar goal is not met, we will continue to save money and pool our resources for the next 8-12 months before proceeding with this step of the bottling process.  We will also continue to sell our powdered version of RELïC and reinvest into our ready-to-drink version. </p>
<p><b>Third dollar goal/milestone: $300,000</b></p>
<p>With all your awesome help we will be able to bring all three delicious flavors to market and provide samples for all our thirsty fans.  To reach this goal would be absolutely amazing because it would mean that all of our flavors would be available at once.   Grocery stores prefer to have a brand that has several options because they tend to sell better. </p>
<p>$ 60,000 for ingredients</p>
<p>$ 165,000</p>
<p>$ 75,000</p>
<p><i>The Impact:</i></p>
<p>Our country is slowly coming to grips with the notion that our food choices are making us sick.  We are proud to have created a drink that will taste good, be good for your body and be something that will fit into our busy modern lives. </p>
<p>Feel free to explain more about your campaign and let people know the difference their contribution will make:</p>

<p><i>Risks &amp; Challenges:</i></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>One of the challenges we've come across in this industry is dealing with its large volume requirements; bottling run minimums are commonly set to 100,000 or more units. </p>
<p>An important hurdle for us to surmount is getting our drink in front of the right health food buyers from different national retailers. Thankfully, we have ample experience and myriad distributor connections that should give us a leg up in this regard. </p>
<p><i><b>Other Ways You Can Help Us:</b></i></p>

History:
 RELïC was born out of pure necessity.  In 2011, my wife and I decided we wanted—no, needed to eat better, and so we started eating Paleo-style. We experienced great success with this change—and just as many struggles.  It soon became clear that we needed help bridging the gap between our Paleo diet and our busy modern lifestyle; it was hard to come by quick meals and snacks that weren’t full of junk.  To make things harder we had strict health requirements: 

Healthy fats (natural coconut oil) 
High-quality, grass-fed whey protein 
No artificial colors or preservatives
No flavorings (natural or artificial) 
No gluten, soy or grains!
Low sugar

...Oh, and it has to taste GREAT too!
With your help we can take the next step. 
We have been in the kitchen and consulted with bottling companies, refining our ingredients and nutritional profile.  During the preparation period we worked very closely with experts in the natural food world to make sure that we have the best ingredients to make the best drink for you.


We didn't find what we required...so we made it!


Why:
A ready-to-drink shake is a great quick meal; it works on the go, anytime. Unfortunately, there is NOTHING out there in that meets our standards. 
On a typical day, the two of us work out at our local CrossFit gym and then rush home to make our post-workout shake. We get out our blender, add our grass-fed whey, water, coconut oil, and some natural ingredients for flavor.  In the process, we make a big mess of the counter-top, blender, and glasses.  , but we could do without the hassle. But, what other option do we have?  Our other option is drinking some of the current drinks out there—drinks made with chemical preservatives, colors, and artificial everything! 
Clearly, a high quality, ready-to-drink shake, made with amazing ingredients—and no crap—would make life markedly easier. 
Since we were already in the food manufacturing business, we headed into our kitchen to make a drink that we knew would be true to our Paleo diet. Why are we doing this? Because we need it for ourselves, and we know we are not alone. 
By living up to the Paleo standard we were able to also help other people with their dietary needs, giving those with allergies, sensitivities, or preferences against gluten, food coloring, and soy access to an easy, healthy and tasty option. After workouts, or anytime you are on the go, you can feel good about drinking our RELïC Paleo Protein Shake!
The Big Idea: 
Since we were already in the food manufacturing business we headed into our kitchen to make a drink that we knew would be true to our Paleo diet.
We knew that the best drink could only be made from highest quality ingredients.
INGREDIENTS:
Grass Fed Whey: Our whey is derived exclusively from cows who eat organically, are grass-fed, and aren't treated with hormones or antibiotics.


Coconut Oil : The pure coconut oil provides healthy oils that help your body thrive.



Dark Chocolate: is not put through artificial processing, which results in a rich, chocolate drinking experience. 



Vanilla Bean- who knew that pure vanilla beans would be so expensive? Nonetheless, the flavor that comes from a natural vanilla bean is vastly superior, so we insisted on its use.



Coffee beans: (only in our espresso drink) We use ground organic coffee beans to provide us with a bold coffee aroma and taste—as well as that extra kick to recharge after a workout, or to start the day. 




What now?
The last 12 months have been instrumental in ensuring that we are ready to transition to large-scale production. We have made the proper contacts with all of our suppliers to lockdown a robust supply chain.  With such large volume requirements we had to make sure that our vendors would be able to keep up with the production without sacrificing quality.

</div></div>","Important notice for extreme sports fans !Hi to everyone, let me introduce myself in a few words : I am Mathieu, really fascinated and practicing sliding sports like skateboard, snowboard, surf and wakeboard and I work in the Apple technology products.My ambitious project is to build the first Wakeboard Park in Vietnam, important country for me, as my wife was born there and my family in-laws owns a wide field in South Vietnam.This dream is of the utmost importance for me, considering the fact that knowing this country and its neighbor countries, the time is really critical to invest in such a project. In fact, Vietnam is beginning to open itself to occidental pleasures like extreme sports for which we could act as Ambassadors.Cost of the project : The total amount of the project is about 500.000$ and here are the details :
1 full cable system with 5 pylon surrounding the South Lake (confirmed and pro level) : 350.00$
1 system 2.0 with 2 pylons single-return with progressive start on either side of the north bank (beginners level) : 20.000$
1 small Hotel (between 10 and 20 rooms) on the riverside, next to the big Park with a terrace restaurant : 100.000$
Electric equipment : 30.000$
Important return on investment : 
The investment on a Wakepark project is profitable within one year.
On the contrary of Europe, on this part of the globe and thanks to the tropical climate, the average temperature is 25degrees all year long. Thus, the installation could fully run 7 days/7days.
There is no Cable Park in Vietnam for the time being, we could be the first to run this activity with a monopole on this type of pleasure.
Vietnamese citizens are beginning to really appreciate sliding sports.
The installation is sirent and ecological.
If the final amount is not reached, a small Cable Park system 2.0 will be created. Less expensive to enable a smooth start of the activity and then, the final project completion.In the future, other activities could be implemented on the site : 
an outdoor skatepark in concrete
a paintball area
a waterjump kicker
a mini-golf
a jacuzzi
a massage center
A world impact : 
Wakeboard is an atypic and expending activity
Wake parks appear everywhere in Europe and in the USA, the 2 biggest in Asia are in Philippines and in ThaÏland, we would be the first to invest in Vietnam.
This country is currently under development and has very poor infrastructures to satisfy local riders, skate, surf and wakeboard (tractor-draw by boat) fans.
A wake park would help to stimulate an area, a town or a region.
This project will be profitable within one year.

</div></strong></div>","Your child is at school or on a trip, and the teacher must remember his allergy or other health information ... You are often on the road or take part in sport and you have an emergency ... Your elderly parents may need some help ... how many situations like these do you recognize yourself?
What about a simple and practical device that contains all the important information for your health and that of your loved ones?



Amyko is a bracelet suitable for any type of wrist and is fully customizable

CONCEPT
Amyko is an NFC technology-based modular bracelet. It can communicate with smartphones and tablets  and share medical information in case of emergencies in accordance with privacy rules.
MODULAR
Amyko is provided with watchband  adapters (modules) that will slide into the band slots of the watch to fit any  wrist  measure. Watchbands are made of certified hypoallergenic thermoplastic rubber.

NFC
NFC (Near Field Communication) is a short-range communication that allows for information sharing between two devices within a short range.
CUSTOMIZATION
Amyko is customizable in a variety of colours and textures: you can change and add new modules to your watchband and make it suit your own look.












STEP1
Upload emergency numbers and your medical information (allergies, intolerances, blood type, etc.) on the cloud Amyko. All your data will be protected by an encrypted key!
STEP2
Wear your bracelet when you practice sport, on holiday, at work, at school, anytime and anywhere, for your and your family's safety.

STEP3In case of emergency, anyone can use a smartphone on the bracelet in order to view the information you want to display and your relatives' contacts. (According to your privacy settings)

<p>The unique 360 design allows players to practice and play <strong>MULTIPLE SPORTS</strong> independently or at the same time.  Need a basketball hoop?  Simply setup the basketball goal and adjust the rim to the preferred height of 7', 8', 9', or 10' high.  Rotate the goal 120 degrees and install the net catcher to play frisbee toss.  Rotate the goal another 120 degrees and install the 8 feet high net to practice kicking football field goals, batting baseballs, or hitting golf balls.  Rotate the goal another 120 degrees and install the pitchback net to have a bounce back return for basketball, baseball, or handball.  That's 360 degrees of unlimited fun and activities!  </p>

<div style=""text-align: center;""><strong>360 Shooter - Our Story, Our Passion, Our Product</strong></div>
<div style=""text-align: center;""> </div>
<p>The team originally planned to submit an application to Shark Tank but decided against that option as we would have to give up significant equity in the company.  Instead, we plan to launch an Indiegogo campaign on 8/24, in memory of Kobe Bryant.  With your support, we believe we can reach our campaign goal and bring the 360 Shooter to market!  </p>
<p>You hear about all of those successful start-up companies formed in a garage or those student geniuses from Stanford or Harvard who launched innovative products.  The team of Coach Don, Reid, and Randy and what they are building is another great entrepreneurial story in the making.  We are excited about what lies ahead in the future and the potential of success of 360 Shooter.</p>
<p>The coach and father-son duo came together in March 2020, right when the home lockdown restrictions were enforced.  Coach Don has coached Reid in several basketball camps at <a href=""http://www.TheBasketballCombineProgram.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.TheBasketballCombineProgram.com</a>.  Reid, an avid basketball player was getting tired of staying indoors. Reid simply wanted to practice his shooting in preparation for the upcoming high school basketball season, where Reid plays basketball for Notre Dame High School.  “All of the sporting goods stores were closed and online shipping times were over 4 weeks,” said Reid Narciso.  “I asked my dad to buy a new goal but instead of buying a portable goal, we designed the initial prototype of 360 Shooter.  I calculated all of the angles and lengths of the poles since I was taking Geometry at the time.  I never thought I would ever use the Pythagorean Theorem in real life, but I used it multiple times to get exact measurements of the 360 Shooter.”   </p>
<p>The father and son team wanted to design a basketball goal that they could use in their front yard, considering their Homeowner’s Association (HOA) didn’t allow those portable goals that you have to fill water or sand.  They also wanted to design a basketball goal that was easy to move and store, so it had to be collapsible and portable.  The father turned to his trusted metal fabricator Custom Built Machines (CBM) in Chatsworth, CA and 360 Shooter was born. </p>
<p>Reid’s dad contacted his close personal friend Coach Don Loperena to help with the business logistics and add more features and functions to the initial design.  Coach Don transformed the original product which was focused primarily on basketball and designed four net options to practice and play <strong>MULTIPLE SPORTS</strong> including but not limited to basketball, football, soccer, baseball, lacrosse, frisbee, hockey, and more.  As the head varsity coach for Granada Hills Charter School, Coach Don knows the market for school sports and recommended several product enhancements.  Knowing the product was a big hit, Coach Don immediately filed a patent on the design and architecture and the rest is history.     </p>
<p>The 360 Shooter is built on a steel triangular base, that holds 3 x aluminum telescoping poles in place.  A basketball rim is mounted on top of the poles, allowing a user to adjust the rim height from 7 feet to 10 feet.  One unique feature of the product is the industrial-strength clamping system that keeps the rim stable and sturdy.  It only takes a few minutes for a user to set up the 360 Shooter and another few minutes to break it down and pack it in the trunk of a car.  “My school needs 5 of these units.  We can not only play basketball but with the flexible net options, but also play multiple sports including whiffle ball, frisbee, hockey, lacrosse, and other sports,” said Don Loperena.  “Storage is a huge issue for PE teachers.  We can bring multiple units out and set them up so easily.  When we are done, we can break them down and store them in a compact area.”      </p>
<p>With 360 Shooter, coaches and skills trainers can change their trainning facility or gym by simply adding multiple goals.  With more goals, players get more shots and more repetitions.  With the sports safety guidelines set by CDC, the 360 Shooter is an ideal training tool that allows players and teams to continue training in a safe manner.  Players can take advantage of the 360 degree playing area and not only meeting social distancing requirements but also focus on new shooting drills.  It’s the same game with a new set of rules.  With 360 Shooter, it’s a more fast-paced game focused on skill development.  Read more about the team, their knowledge, expertise, and experiences @<a href=""http://www.360Shooter.net"" rel=""noopener nofollow""> www.360Shooter.net.</a></p>

With 360 Shooter, playing basketball is the same game but with new rules.  The ball return system (implemented via Power Bungees) increases the pace of the game, allowing coaches to really emphasize conditioning drills.  Just like hockey, players can now shoot behind the goal, forcing them to create new game strategies.  Coaches can also focus on skill development like shooting, shooting, and more shooting.  Oh yeah, coaches can also emphasize dribbling and passing drills, while developing core fundamentals with 360 Shooter.  Simply add one of the four net options to practice and play MULTIPLE SPORTS including but not limited to basketball, football, soccer, baseball, lacrosse, frisbee, hockey, and more.

Our Tribute to Kobe Bryant
 
 


360 Shooter - Our Story, Our Passion, Our Product
 
The team originally planned to submit an application to Shark Tank but decided against that option as we would have to give up significant equity in the company.  Instead, we plan to launch an Indiegogo campaign on 8/24, in memory of Kobe Bryant.  With your support, we believe we can reach our campaign goal and bring the 360 Shooter to market!  
You hear about all of those successful start-up companies formed in a garage or those student geniuses from Stanford or Harvard who launched innovative products.  The team of Coach Don, Reid, and Randy and what they are building is another great entrepreneurial story in the making.  We are excited about what lies ahead in the future and the potential of success of 360 Shooter.
The coach and father-son duo came together in March 2020, right when the home lockdown restrictions were enforced.  Coach Don has coached Reid in several basketball camps at www.TheBasketballCombineProgram.com.  Reid, an avid basketball player was getting tired of staying indoors. Reid simply wanted to practice his shooting in preparation for the upcoming high school basketball season, where Reid plays basketball for Notre Dame High School.  “All of the sporting goods stores were closed and online shipping times were over 4 weeks,” said Reid Narciso.  “I asked my dad to buy a new goal but instead of buying a portable goal, we designed the initial prototype of 360 Shooter.  I calculated all of the angles and lengths of the poles since I was taking Geometry at the time.  I never thought I would ever use the Pythagorean Theorem in real life, but I used it multiple times to get exact measurements of the 360 Shooter.”   
The father and son team wanted to design a basketball goal that they could use in their front yard, considering their Homeowner’s Association (HOA) didn’t allow those portable goals that you have to fill water or sand.  They also wanted to design a basketball goal that was easy to move and store, so it had to be collapsible and portable.  The father turned to his trusted metal fabricator Custom Built Machines (CBM) in Chatsworth, CA and 360 Shooter was born. 
Reid’s dad contacted his close personal friend Coach Don Loperena to help with the business logistics and add more features and functions to the initial design.  Coach Don transformed the original product which was focused primarily on basketball and designed four net options to practice and play MULTIPLE SPORTS including but not limited to basketball, football, soccer, baseball, lacrosse, frisbee, hockey, and more.  As the head varsity coach for Granada Hills Charter School, Coach Don knows the market for school sports and recommended several product enhancements.  Knowing the product was a big hit, Coach Don immediately filed a patent on the design and architecture and the rest is history.     
The 360 Shooter is built on a steel triangular base, that holds 3 x aluminum telescoping poles in place.  A basketball rim is mounted on top of the poles, allowing a user to adjust the rim height from 7 feet to 10 feet.  One unique feature of the product is the industrial-strength clamping system that keeps the rim stable and sturdy.  It only takes a few minutes for a user to set up the 360 Shooter and another few minutes to break it down and pack it in the trunk of a car.  “My school needs 5 of these units.  We can not only play basketball but with the flexible net options, but also play multiple sports including whiffle ball, frisbee, hockey, lacrosse, and other sports,” said Don Loperena.  “Storage is a huge issue for PE teachers.  We can bring multiple units out and set them up so easily.  When we are done, we can break them down and store them in a compact area.”      
With 360 Shooter, coaches and skills trainers can change their trainning facility or gym by simply adding multiple goals.  With more goals, players get more shots and more repetitions.  With the sports safety guidelines set by CDC, the 360 Shooter is an ideal training tool that allows players and teams to continue training in a safe manner.  Players can take advantage of the 360 degree playing area and not only meeting social distancing requirements but also focus on new shooting drills.  It’s the same game with a new set of rules.  With 360 Shooter, it’s a more fast-paced game focused on skill development.  Read more about the team, their knowledge, expertise, and experiences @ www.360Shooter.net.
 
 


We know what it takes to bring new products to market and we understand all the different things that can go wrong.  We have dual source providers for most of materials and have arranged secondary services in case things don't go as planned.  Our biggest challenge is sourcing the industrial strength telescoping poles and adding our custom designed sleeve protectors.  We also need to fabricate the clamping system to allow the net add-ons.  We know we can source the materials and find the services to fabricate our designs, it's just a matter of how long it will take to make everything happen.  
We have agreed to preliminary terms and conditions with our manufacturer and are committed to deliver your 360 Shooter unit to you.  Since we have already paid for most of upfront product costs, we are guaranteeing the delivery of your unit.  We also offer a risk free policy, ensuring that your are satisfied with your product.  To lower costs even further, we are waiving all shipping costs during our campaign.  We are confident your will love your 360 Shooter!",16.0,10,"1 Campaign

They also help attract other positively charged things. It’s just magnetism, and the rules of magnetism are consistent regardless of what we’re talking about.</p><p>This is what makes negative ions particularly useful if you wanted, for example, to attract something out of the air by magnetizing it to negative ions.</p><h3> </h3><h3><strong>Negative Ions and AntiVirBag</strong></h3><p>This is the idea behind <strong>AntiVirBag</strong>, and this is what we mean when we say negative ions can actually help clean up the air you breathe every day.</p><p>The idea behind negative ions for air purification is simple. You have stuff in the air you want to filter out, right? Most of it has a strong positive charge because again, we’re all way over-positive (ionically speaking). When you send negative ions into a room, they work to attract positively charged molecules through the power of magnetism.</p><p>Once the effect kicks in, it’s much easier to keep it going.

for an ozone generator in which charged metal plates act on the ambient air to kill pollutants. Through the technical progress of the last 100 years, we have reduced the size of the antivirbag to a portable and battery-operated version. The technical components are reproduced and improved in a prototype, and it works. An experienced engineer makes the technical drawings. In consultation with the factory, the production of an antivirbag will be possible without problems. <br/>Our supporters' only theoretical risk in this project is that we may not raise enough money to finance the minimum order from the factory to produce the antivirbag. <br/>For decades I have been dealing with the greatest inventor of all times, Nikola tesla, and his innovations and technologies, most of which have been forgotten. I have already brought several of his technologies back to the market, such as the high-frequency device wassermatrix.<br/>So I have experience in development, product introduction, and sales.<br/>So there should be no risks for the project supporters.<br/> </p><p> </p><p><strong>Long-lasting design</strong></p><p>The antivirbag is constructed so that the material and technical components remain functional for a long time in all weather conditions. Should the battery become weak over time, it can be replaced at any repair shop or by non-specialists with technical knowledge. This will maximize the life of the antivirbag and should last many times longer than the ozonizers or ionizers on the market.</p><p>This should contribute to the reduction of electronic waste.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Reusability and recyclability</strong></p><p>We will use environmentally friendly packaging for the antivirus bag, including rPet.                    The outer cover will be metallic.The plastic content inside will be reduced as much as possible.The use of a rechargeable battery instead of single-use batteries will further reduce the environmental impact.By using recyclable materials as far as possible and a rechargeable battery, we want to reduce the waste load as much as possible.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Sustainable materials</strong></p><p>The serial version of the antivirbag will have a metallic cover. The use of plastic in the components inside will be reduced as much as possible. In this way, we want to help reduce plastic waste, which is very polluting to our environment, and maximize the recycling capacity of the antivirbag.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Environmentally friendly factories</strong></p><p>The future production plant of the Antivirbag will be in Germany, due to the strict german laws high environmental standards in production are guaranteed. Also, we attach great importance to the fact that the production plant will be operated with 100% renewable energy to reduce the CO2 footprint of the antivirbag as much as possible.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Sustainable fulfillment and distribution</strong></p><p>we will optimize our shipping routes by relying on a flexible eCommerce fulfillment solution with our logistics partners to achieve the shortest possible shipping routes. Thereby we want to reduce the CO2 footprint of the antivirbag further.</p><div style=""text-align: center;""> </div><div style=""text-align: center;""> </div><div style=""text-align: center;""> </div><p> </p></div>","AntiVirBag is designed to be highly portable, with straps that allow you to wear it on the upper chest, shoulder, and head areas depending on your preference.

It can supply a 20 square meter room with purified, ozonized air, so that everyone in the room can breathe more safely, That way, you get purified air, even if you’re in a crowded space full of unclean air. This is how AntiVirBag goes the extra mile. NO ADDITIONAL FILTER CHANGESThe innovative technical concept of the antivirbag uses the physical and chemical properties of ions and ozone to filter harmful particles out of the air. As a result, additional filter systems with a limited period of effectiveness can be dispensed with. Our customers' advantage is that, compared to competing products, no filter exchange is necessary, and thus no additional costs are incurred. When and Where Can the Antivirbag Be Used?The Antivirbag can be used just about anywhere that you need purified air, including:
Home
Work
A busy sidewalk
Your car
Public transportation
A crowded elevator
A restaurant
A coffee shop
Basically, the Antivirbag can go pretty much anywhere that you do. It’s safe, portable, and easy to use, and it will always work to purify the air no matter where you happen to travel.    Negative Ions in the AirWhat effects do negative ions have on the air we breathe?We’ve been harping on magnetism and the power of negative ions because they have a certain attractiveness. Remember when we said negative ions attract positive ions?The same is true of negative ions in the air.When you put negative ions into the air, they do what negative ions do best–attract positively charged ions. They also help attract other positively charged things. It’s just magnetism, and the rules of magnetism are consistent regardless of what we’re talking about.This is what makes negative ions particularly useful if you wanted, for example, to attract something out of the air by magnetizing it to negative ions. Negative Ions and AntiVirBagThis is the idea behind AntiVirBag, and this is what we mean when we say negative ions can actually help clean up the air you breathe every day.The idea behind negative ions for air purification is simple. You have stuff in the air you want to filter out, right? Most of it has a strong positive charge because again, we’re all way over-positive (ionically speaking). When you send negative ions into a room, they work to attract positively charged molecules through the power of magnetism.Once the effect kicks in, it’s much easier to keep it going. This tricks particles into clumping together to form larger particles, which makes it easier to filter out.  What can negative ions do for health?Blood purification: Many scientists and doctors recognize that alkalization of the body is the key to health. According to Dr. Tanaka (University of Kyoto), negative ions increase the number of negative ions of calcium and potassium in the blood (negative ionization), making the blood more alkaline again. The cells are revitalized: When the number of negative ions increases, the cell function is activated. The metabolism is stimulated, and the elimination of waste products is promoted. The metabolism is also improved, which revitalizes the entire cell function.The immune system is strengthened: By increasing the number of negative ions, the gamma globulin level is also increased, which enriches the blood with proteins and immune substances. Managing the function of the autonomic nervous system:Dr. Tanaka (University of Tokyo) has further found that negative ions influence the balance between insulin function and adrenal gland function in the autonomic nervous system, strengthening immunity.Negative ions and healthy sleep:Our sleep cycle consists of four levels of sleep depth. These levels are repeated four or five times in seven to eight hours. Our body can only absorb 15-20% of negative ions, so it is essential to be exposed to them for as long as possible.The air we breathe in closed rooms contains only 100-200 negative ions per cm3, so we can only absorb 15 to 30 of them per cm3.        We have been working to develop AntiVirBag for last 8 months and we are glad to announce that our prototype is fully functional and ready to enter production phase.                           Risks and Challenges:The technical operating principle of the antivirbag is based on a patent of the famous Nikola Tesla and his Tesla Ozone Company from 1896 for an ozone generator in which charged metal plates act on the ambient air to kill pollutants. Through the technical progress of the last 100 years, we have reduced the size of the antivirbag to a portable and battery-operated version. The technical components are reproduced and improved in a prototype, and it works. An experienced engineer makes the technical drawings. In consultation with the factory, the production of an antivirbag will be possible without problems. Our supporters' only theoretical risk in this project is that we may not raise enough money to finance the minimum order from the factory to produce the antivirbag. For decades I have been dealing with the greatest inventor of all times, Nikola tesla, and his innovations and technologies, most of which have been forgotten. I have already brought several of his technologies back to the market, such as the high-frequency device wassermatrix.So I have experience in development, product introduction, and sales.So there should be no risks for the project supporters.  Long-lasting designThe antivirbag is constructed so that the material and technical components remain functional for a long time in all weather conditions. Should the battery become weak over time, it can be replaced at any repair shop or by non-specialists with technical knowledge. This will maximize the life of the antivirbag and should last many times longer than the ozonizers or ionizers on the market.This should contribute to the reduction of electronic waste. Reusability and recyclabilityWe will use environmentally friendly packaging for the antivirus bag, including rPet.                    The outer cover will be metallic.The plastic content inside will be reduced as much as possible.The use of a rechargeable battery instead of single-use batteries will further reduce the environmental impact.By using recyclable materials as far as possible and a rechargeable battery, we want to reduce the waste load as much as possible. Sustainable materialsThe serial version of the antivirbag will have a metallic cover. The use of plastic in the components inside will be reduced as much as possible. In this way, we want to help reduce plastic waste, which is very polluting to our environment, and maximize the recycling capacity of the antivirbag. Environmentally friendly factoriesThe future production plant of the Antivirbag will be in Germany, due to the strict german laws high environmental standards in production are guaranteed. Also, we attach great importance to the fact that the production plant will be operated with 100% renewable energy to reduce the CO2 footprint of the antivirbag as much as possible. Sustainable fulfillment and distributionwe will optimize our shipping routes by relying on a flexible eCommerce fulfillment solution with our logistics partners to achieve the shortest possible shipping routes. Thereby we want to reduce the CO2 footprint of the antivirbag further.",43.0,1,"2 Campaigns

<br/><div>My Health Net is developed to reduce emergency response times in order to provide life-saving emergency medical alerting services to everyone (anytime and anywhere).  This service represents a medical revolution, as it provides the unparalleled service of immediate medical emergency response for less than 1/10th of the cost other ""monitoring service companies.""   Due to it's innovative approach to digital health, My Health Net is more relevant, more comprehensive, more efficient, and provides significantly more immediate medical help than what can be provided via high priced ""monitoring companies"" and their respective proprietary devices.<div>
<br/><p>Everyone strives for a healthy lifestyle, but the fact is medical emergencies happen!  The need for emergency medical help is inescapable; at some point in life, everyone will experience a time when they need emergency medical help.  For the young children and adolescents it may be most needed  due to broken bones and torn ligaments.  For young adults, it may be most needed for car/accidents, major ailments, or drug/alcohol abuse.  For adults 45-70, it may be due to complications from major health issues (like heart disease, high blood pressure, sugar diabetes and etc.).  The point is, we all need emergency help and attention at some point, and therefore everyone needs an emergency health safety net!   </p>
<p>When there is need for emergency medical attention,  we are at increased risk of not receiving it in enough time to:</p>
<p><strong>- Prevent further damage and suffering to our bodies</strong></p>
<p><strong>- Save our lives!</strong></p>
<p><b>The critical factor that will help prevent more damage to our bodies and save our lives, is ""TIME!""  </b>Time is critical.  If emergency response time is a relatively short 3-5 minutes, when lives are saved and long-term complications are mitigated.  If emergency response is rendered in the national average of 12-15 minutes, many (otherwise preventable) lives are lost, long-term complications ensue, and medical bills skyrocket.  </p>
<p>There are many reasons why there is a lapse in the time it may take for someone to receive emergency medial help.  What has emerged as one of the most prevalent reasons why response time may be hampered is, 70+% of the over 240 million 911 calls are made from cell phones, but only approx. 50% of 911 centers can appropriately determine  GPS/location data from cell phones.  This means, when medical emergences occur while just walking down the street, car accidents, or unanticipated health problems, and the caller is incapacitated or incoherent, there could be significant delays in medical emergency response which could translate to loss of life. This is a huge problem.   </p>
<p><strong></strong></p>
<p></p>
<strong> Health Net complements efficacy of 911 emergency services by providing acceleration of alerts to people who can respond fastest/quickly (most often, friends and family) with location/data.  Imagine a time when everyone in need of 911 could be located, identified, and efficiently provided with medical attention from emergency responders. Imagine this unparalleled emergency service being provided in 4-6 minutes (less than half the time of current national averages of 12-15 minutes). This is what My Health Net delivers.</strong><p></p>
<p><strong>Why My Health Net? </strong></p>

If emergency medical aid comes in the national average of 12-15 minutes due to bad location data limited or no patient info, life expectancy is greatly diminished (even if patient survives, extended hospital stay, prolonged convalesce, and/or diminished recovery/healing, are likely). Since time is of the essence during medical emergencies, everyone has incentive to be prepared by initiating  their personal health net!<p>The My Health Net (MHN) solution is designed to: </p>
<p><strong>• Help ensure 100% alert notification (including location data) to an entire “health network,” during medical emergency distress </strong></p>
<p><strong>• Significantly reduce the time it takes to get help to individuals in medical distress by providing immediate alerting simultaneously to multiple  emergency contacts, doctors, and local Fire/EMS. Reduced emergency response times coupled with real-time patient vitals significantly reduces patient deaths, and increases efficiency of Fire/EMS </strong></p>
<p><strong>• Compliment 911/systems by cutting emergency medical response times in half (consistently less than 7 minutes) via concurrent smartphone alerts that provide “patient” medical information, location services, and real-time patient heart rate/vitals. </strong></p>
<p><strong>• Enables friends and family to quickly respond with life-saving AED (defibrillator) </strong></p>
<p><strong> • Alleviate multi-step emergency medical dispatch complexities by proactive notifications to Fire/EMS that allows a “head-start” to patient location. </strong></p>
<p>With almost universal smartphone usage for medical emergencies, market forces are now at a point when unparalleled immediate medical response can be delivered to all people, communities and societies via smartphone technology. </p>
<p><strong>How does MHN ""pull it off?""</strong></p>
<p><strong><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1447195116/kuc1dplpmtcmacyyzrp7.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 609.3921161825726px; height: 497px;""/></strong></p>
<p></p>
<p>With My Health Net, an entire health network is alerted and dispatched to those in medical distress at the push of a button.  This immediate multi-point simultaneous network notification, is what helps accelerate the life-saving response.   Our solution combines the power of smartphones, wearables (Apple &amp; Android watches/Fitbit) and social media integration in order to escalate mass notification to a network of help; it is designed to expedite alerting and notification to ensure everyone gets immediate emergency response as quickly as possible.  </p>
<p>While all smartphone users will get significantly increased emergency response, those who also utilize ""wearables"" will benefit from additional features. For instance, when a medical emergency happens, and users need immediate medical attention, they just:  1. Push a button to immediately connect to 911 (911 will dispatch accordingly) 2. Simultaneously however, an alert with the user location and information is also immediately escalated to local Fire/EMS and specific (user defined) emergency contacts including friends/family/neighbors (this of course, increases the number of individuals who can respond to medical need/distress); also, the user’s doctor(s) are proactively notified with relevant patient data. 3. While all alerts and notifications are immediately sent (within 1 second) with GPS location information, locally-situated AED locations are also illuminated on the map  and provided to emergency contacts. This allows emergency contacts to navigate to the   user in medical distress and arrive with an AED defibrillator.  By the time local Fire/EMS receives the dispatch from 911, they will be already in route or at the MHN users’ location; this saves precious minutes, which saves lives. Think about it, an entire network of emergency help is proactively activated at a push of a button! This ensures the user is “never-alone” or neglected in time of dire emergency need; this alone helps provide users with confidence “help is on the way” and gives life-saving encouragement during life’s most debilitating moments when many lose “hope” (exacerbating their survivability). 4. When wearable’s are in use, current vitals (“real-time” heart rate, blood oxygen, and etc.) are also tracked and proactively reported to emergency medical responders.  In all, My Health net is a medical revolution!</p>

</div>
</div></div>","Do you know when your next medical emergency will occur?  If there were a service that provides you and your family with emergency medical help in less than half the typical emergency medical response times, and for less than a nickel a day, would you subscribe to it?  This is the promise of My Health Net.
My Health Net is developed to reduce emergency response times in order to provide life-saving emergency medical alerting services to everyone (anytime and anywhere).  This service represents a medical revolution, as it provides the unparalleled service of immediate medical emergency response for less than 1/10th of the cost other ""monitoring service companies.""   Due to it's innovative approach to digital health, My Health Net is more relevant, more comprehensive, more efficient, and provides significantly more immediate medical help than what can be provided via high priced ""monitoring companies"" and their respective proprietary devices.
Everyone strives for a healthy lifestyle, but the fact is medical emergencies happen!  The need for emergency medical help is inescapable; at some point in life, everyone will experience a time when they need emergency medical help.  For the young children and adolescents it may be most needed  due to broken bones and torn ligaments.  For young adults, it may be most needed for car/accidents, major ailments, or drug/alcohol abuse.  For adults 45-70, it may be due to complications from major health issues (like heart disease, high blood pressure, sugar diabetes and etc.).  The point is, we all need emergency help and attention at some point, and therefore everyone needs an emergency health safety net!   
When there is need for emergency medical attention,  we are at increased risk of not receiving it in enough time to:
- Prevent further damage and suffering to our bodies
- Save our lives!
The critical factor that will help prevent more damage to our bodies and save our lives, is ""TIME!""  Time is critical.  If emergency response time is a relatively short 3-5 minutes, when lives are saved and long-term complications are mitigated.  If emergency response is rendered in the national average of 12-15 minutes, many (otherwise preventable) lives are lost, long-term complications ensue, and medical bills skyrocket.  
There are many reasons why there is a lapse in the time it may take for someone to receive emergency medial help.  What has emerged as one of the most prevalent reasons why response time may be hampered is, 70+% of the over 240 million 911 calls are made from cell phones, but only approx. 50% of 911 centers can appropriately determine  GPS/location data from cell phones.  This means, when medical emergences occur while just walking down the street, car accidents, or unanticipated health problems, and the caller is incapacitated or incoherent, there could be significant delays in medical emergency response which could translate to loss of life. This is a huge problem.   


 Health Net complements efficacy of 911 emergency services by providing acceleration of alerts to people who can respond fastest/quickly (most often, friends and family) with location/data.  Imagine a time when everyone in need of 911 could be located, identified, and efficiently provided with medical attention from emergency responders. Imagine this unparalleled emergency service being provided in 4-6 minutes (less than half the time of current national averages of 12-15 minutes). This is what My Health Net delivers.
Why My Health Net? 

With My Health Net, emergency help arrives in 4-6 minutes and professionals have access to medical history, prescriptions, allergies and current heart rate (via wearables). This means life expectancy and opportunity for a life of “normalcy” is very good. If emergency medical aid comes in the national average of 12-15 minutes due to bad location data limited or no patient info, life expectancy is greatly diminished (even if patient survives, extended hospital stay, prolonged convalesce, and/or diminished recovery/healing, are likely). Since time is of the essence during medical emergencies, everyone has incentive to be prepared by initiating  their personal health net!The My Health Net (MHN) solution is designed to: 
• Help ensure 100% alert notification (including location data) to an entire “health network,” during medical emergency distress 
• Significantly reduce the time it takes to get help to individuals in medical distress by providing immediate alerting simultaneously to multiple  emergency contacts, doctors, and local Fire/EMS. Reduced emergency response times coupled with real-time patient vitals significantly reduces patient deaths, and increases efficiency of Fire/EMS 
• Compliment 911/systems by cutting emergency medical response times in half (consistently less than 7 minutes) via concurrent smartphone alerts that provide “patient” medical information, location services, and real-time patient heart rate/vitals. 
• Enables friends and family to quickly respond with life-saving AED (defibrillator) 
 • Alleviate multi-step emergency medical dispatch complexities by proactive notifications to Fire/EMS that allows a “head-start” to patient location. 
With almost universal smartphone usage for medical emergencies, market forces are now at a point when unparalleled immediate medical response can be delivered to all people, communities and societies via smartphone technology. 
How does MHN ""pull it off?""


With My Health Net, an entire health network is alerted and dispatched to those in medical distress at the push of a button.  This immediate multi-point simultaneous network notification, is what helps accelerate the life-saving response.   Our solution combines the power of smartphones, wearables (Apple & Android watches/Fitbit) and social media integration in order to escalate mass notification to a network of help; it is designed to expedite alerting and notification to ensure everyone gets immediate emergency response as quickly as possible.  
While all smartphone users will get significantly increased emergency response, those who also utilize ""wearables"" will benefit from additional features. For instance, when a medical emergency happens, and users need immediate medical attention, they just:  1. Push a button to immediately connect to 911 (911 will dispatch accordingly) 2. Simultaneously however, an alert with the user location and information is also immediately escalated to local Fire/EMS and specific (user defined) emergency contacts including friends/family/neighbors (this of course, increases the number of individuals who can respond to medical need/distress); also, the user’s doctor(s) are proactively notified with relevant patient data. 3. While all alerts and notifications are immediately sent (within 1 second) with GPS location information, locally-situated AED locations are also illuminated on the map  and provided to emergency contacts. This allows emergency contacts to navigate to the   user in medical distress and arrive with an AED defibrillator.  By the time local Fire/EMS receives the dispatch from 911, they will be already in route or at the MHN users’ location; this saves precious minutes, which saves lives. Think about it, an entire network of emergency help is proactively activated at a push of a button! This ensures the user is “never-alone” or neglected in time of dire emergency need; this alone helps provide users with confidence “help is on the way” and gives life-saving encouragement during life’s most debilitating moments when many lose “hope” (exacerbating their survivability). 4. When wearable’s are in use, current vitals (“real-time” heart rate, blood oxygen, and etc.) are also tracked and proactively reported to emergency medical responders.  In all, My Health net is a medical revolution!

Ydilia was treated at a compassionate use program in Peru. After receiving her treatment she was able to work as a teacher again.


But for many,
gaining access to compassionate use programs can be extremely difficult. As featured on CNBC, when 15 year-old Nathalie was diagnosed with a rare form of
cancer, her family campaigned for several months before finally getting access
to a potentially life-improving therapy.
""We reached a point as we learned more that there
might be some things that could help Nathalie,"" her father said to CNBC. ""But
the way the system was built, she couldn't access it.""

Our Story

The founders of ICanWin are also the founders of Immunophotonics, a company developing an early stage cancer treatment that is intended to train the immune system to recognize and destroy cancer cells. It is still in the early stages of the rigorous U.S. development and approval process. The treatment was first used in a South American clinical trial facilitated by Dr. Maria Guerra.
When we met Dr. Guerra at a medical conference 7 years ago we were floored by her desire to help patients in her home country of Peru. She passed away several years ago, but left an indelible mark on us. She made us realize, that despite the obstacles, one person can make an enormous difference in the lives of others and that providing experimental treatments has the potential to help those who need it the most. 


ICanWin at a Glance


The Vision - To coordinate compassionate use for patients who have exhausted all other treatment options

Compassionate Use - Gives patients the ability to access experimental treatments such as, cancer therapies that are in the early stages of development

Combating Cancer - Our first partner, Immunophotonics, gives us access to a developing cancer vaccine

Right Now - We will provide this developing cancer vaccine to international partner physicians so they can treat patients

Donations - Will be used to initially help 10 - 15 patients, build a database, and hire an executive director

As We Grow - We hope to expand into other life-threatening illnesses


How Your Contribution Can Help
Our aim is to raise $200,000 to help patients in a compassionate use setting, build a database, and hire additional staff. All donations are tax deductible in the United States.
Funds will be used as follows:

Patient Care - $110,000
Staff - $60,000
Information Management - $15,000
Office and Travel - $15,000



Immunophotonics will donate its cancer vaccine, which is in the early stages of development, to partner clinics outside the United States (clinics listed below). We already have international clinical sites ready to help, and we just need your donations to help our partner physicians treat the first 10 -15 patients globally in a compassionate use setting. 

Donate Today!

Your donation can make a major difference in the lives of cancer patients running out of treatment options while also expanding compassionate use programs. Help us help those out of options.
Growing the Organization
If we are successful with this campaign, we intend to add more biotech partners to offer even more developing therapies to our international partner physicians. Our goal is to provide support for patients one project at a time.
Thank You!
We hope ICanWin can become a crucial resource for patients running out of options. We love and value your
support in developing this potentially life-altering program.

<br/><h3>La Granja Esavas Fundraiser</h3>
<p>
</p>
<p>“Life is a challenge, meet it.”<br/><i>Mother
Teresa</i><br/></p>
<p>“There must be something, which is worth working and living for.
Something that gives you the feedback: you are needed,” we have been thinking about
since years now.<br/>
Having good jobs and earning good money is not everything, in our opinion.<br/>
We want to give back. We want to step back. To do a new step forward.<br/>
Live, work and earn in harmony with nature.</p>
<p style="""">And that brought us to La Granja Esavas. An idea was born. An idea, which has
become a concept, and subsequently to a project: our farm La Granja Esavas in Spain.<br/>
Live and give.<br/>
</p>
<p></p>
<b><span>¡</span>Retorno al origen!</b><br/>Our farm will be a place for everyone. For humans, for animals, for nature
itself. Giving old and younger donkeys a home. Bringing donkey therapy closer to a broader audience. Provide the therapeutic benefits for physically, mentally and intellectually disabled children and adults (as in ADHD, PTSD). <br/>Give people a place to calm. Cool down from a Burnout. Or to prevent it.<p></p>
<p></p>

Work on fields, produce products to sell on site, on markets and in our online
shop.<br/>We, Gabriela and Hermann, have the power, the willingness and the knowledge to let La Granja Esavas come true.<br/>
We have profound knowledge AND experiences in following branches: health care and health
products, medical care and products, burnout prophylaxes, IT technologies,
marketing technologies, craft experiences, agriculture, cattle breeding and
more.
 
<p>But one thing we are missing to let this come true: the financial
resources.<br/>
And that’s the part where you supporters come in ;)<br/>
Your part is essential to this project. With your contribution we can start and
expand our centre and offer. See our “donkey puzzle”.</p>

<h3><br/></h3>
<h3>Why La Granja Esavas needs YOUR help</h3>
<p>Crowdfunding is an absolutely wonderful way having our fans included to
the project. Not only do we want our community to feel being a part of this
process, we invite you to give us feedback and ideas and help us perfect our
concept.</p>
<p>One thing that has been very very important to us from the early stages
of planning is to stay away from loans of any kind at start-up. Starting a
business in debt adds an enormous amount of pressure to succeed. It's been a
long hard road and we've still got a ways to go, but this is our goal. Doing
things such as working overtime, cutting personal spending, sourcing used
equipment, building some of our own equipment, selling a beloved vehicle, and
getting some very gracious assistance from friends have been crucial to making
this happen.</p>
<p>Our
main concern right now is having the money available for buying a farm and
fields. We have decided to buy and own an old traditional Finca where we have
to do a lot of renovation work. We are aware of that we've a lot of work ahead
of us, but we are definitely up for the task. <br/>This is not the first time for
us, doing tasks like plumbing, electricity, heating, building, painting and
doing woodwork by ourselves, we feel that it is perfect for us. We are
extremely excited about breathing new life into a place with rich history - in
our new home. However, history comes with a price. With your help, we can ease
the financial burden of buying and building renovations a bit.</p>
<p>This
will allow us to focus more on our equipment, like special saddles and carts for disabled kids and adults, and gathering more knowledge and
information. We have already collected huge amount of stuff and information we
will need at start-up and are hard at work perfecting an initial collection of
recipes. We just need a place to make it all come together.</p>

<br/>
<h3>Budget &amp; Schedule</h3>
<p>The
money we raise with this campaign will be used towards opening La Granja Esavas
from the ground up.<br/>
We want to be in full re-construction of the property by late autumn this year
and we aim to open by spring-summer 2016. Our plan is also to have all the La
Granja Esavas brand merchandise available to buy from us and from an online
store at our website.</p>

<h3>
<br/>Planned Features at La Granja Esavas</h3>
<p>Already said earlier, we would like to create a place for people and
animals. <br/>A place in nature, for nature and with nature.</p>
<b>That are our main goals we want to achieve</b>:<p></p>
<ul>
<li>Give old and/or deferred donkeys a graceful
     home. With plenty of space and stables.</li>
<li>Donkey therapy (Asinotherapy) is a therapy
     where donkey is the principal support.</li>
<li>Animal Assisted Therapy (AAT) to improve social, emotional, or cognitive functioning.</li>
<li>Burnout prophylaxes trainings, for individuals
     or small groups.</li>
<li>For team building and motivational effectiveness, for groups 
to bond with donkeys, alpacas, sheep, rabbits and more.<br/>
</li>
<li>Courses about herbs and spices, tea creation,
     healthy eating, … all done in the fields</li>
<li>Breed donkeys and let kids have fun with them</li>
<li>Ostrich breeding</li>
<li>On site and online shop, for our goods and
     merchandize</li>
<li>Vacation home in a private environment</li>
<li>A place where you have the possibility to volunteer</li>
</ul>
</div>

<br/>
<h3>What YOU will GET</h3>
<p>We had long sessions thinking and discussing about the packages which we
should offer you. They have to be attractive, useful and related to our project.<br/>
Finally we created some which will be outstanding enough encourage you to
support our project. Hopefully.</p>
<p>There are still ideas and concepts for additional packs, the mystery
ones, which we will release later on.<br/>
Also planned is a referral campaign with some great merchandize. There's more to come.</p>

<h3><br/></h3>
<h3>Challenges &amp; Risks<br/>
</h3>
<p>Family and friends, also other people have been asking us if we are sure
going on to realize this big step in our life. Our answer was, and is always:
YES. This has already started as a “project” in our mind years ago. From a
simple daydream, talking about our thoughts, Gabriela and I started to realize
this. There are many risks and challenges.</p>
<p>Our biggest challenge that we have right now is collecting the funds for
buying the farm and fields, our first donkeys and ostriches and to get over the
first year.</p>
<p>There are always risk and challenges, in private life as in business,
but we have a good condition, a good business plan and the knowledge and
willingness to start and continue such a project, we are well prepared.</p>
<p>Beside our actual work, we have started to learn Spanish, improved our
knowledge in farming, product knowledge. We also did, and are still doing, some
kind of market analysis. Just to be informed about the actual market situation
in the branch which we are stepping in. And of course, creating something new
and different combined with the standard, traditional goods.</p>
<p>We both have the strength and willingness to do that. And we have shown
this in the past. When we have married, we started with nothing. No, sorry, we
had debts. But within 6 years we come from a rented 1 room apartment up to a
small owned house, have good jobs and our 2 great kids.</p>
<p>Also our skills, paired with above qualities, let us drive in bringing
this project up and running.</p>
<p>Each single Euro will bring us closer, realizing La Granja Esavas.<br/>
<b>Now we already thank you for your support! Whatever kind!</b></p>

<h3>Frequently asked Questions</h3>
  Have a question?
<ul>
<li>Ask your ...</li>
<li>Well, joke, look at the FAQ (below)  first.</li>
<li>If your question isn’t answered <strong>here</strong>, then ask us.</li>
<li>If you ask a question, be patient.  We’ll respond as fast as we can, but there are a lot of you sending email, and  only two of us. But, we’ll get there.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Q</strong>: Do you know what you are doing?<br/>
<strong>A</strong>: Sometimes not! But in this case – YES! We know that we will have to use our hands. Give all the power of our bodies. Get up early – go to bed lately.</p>
<p><strong>Q</strong>: Do you own the knowledge of what are going to do /provide?<br/>
<strong>A</strong>: Yes. We had worked hard at different farms already. We know how to breed, how to feed and how to work with animals. Especially with cows, pigs, poultries and rabbits. We are right now learning at ostrich farms and from other, befriended farmers.<br/>
Also, we have the knowledge of herbs, spices, fruits, vegetables, corns and flowers. How to seed and further food production.</p>
<p><strong>Q</strong>: What if you fail to reach the farm goal?<br/>
<strong>A</strong>: Well,
as we have staggered milestones (description available on esavas.es) for
getting the funds to start our business, <span>we will strengthen our work and do our utmost to achieve our final goal</span>.
<br/>But in that case we can start the production of our own teas and other products
where we get the ingredients from least fields near us and from befriended
farmers. Some packs cannot be fulfilled then, but we will find a solution for
that. The remaining funds will be held and added to our income and additional
funding projects till we will receive enough to buy our Finca.</p>
<p><strong>Q</strong>: Can I trust you?<br/>
<strong>A</strong>: Good question! But we can put your mind at ease: we have a good reputation, we are keeping our promises and that is also important for having good friends.</p>

<strong>A</strong>: Our house will still stay as the home for our kids, as they will still stay at the house and continue working at their companies.</p>
<p><strong>Q</strong>: When will the packages be delivered?<br/>
<strong>A</strong>: We start delivering packs and give more information and details on the delivery after the campaign. As soon as the Merchandise is made available to us, we will be sending out all the post cards, merchandises &amp; teas. This will be a few months from now. This is an ongoing campaign after this 60 day soft launch, so don’t worry we will still be going strong with regular updates to you.</p>
<p><strong>Q</strong>: Will there be more packs offered?<br/>
<strong>A</strong>: Yes, there will more packs offered later in the campaign. We will update you on the packs via Indiegogo updates and on our social pages.</p>

La Granja Esavas Fundraiser


“Life is a challenge, meet it.”Mother
Teresa
“There must be something, which is worth working and living for.
Something that gives you the feedback: you are needed,” we have been thinking about
since years now.
Having good jobs and earning good money is not everything, in our opinion.
We want to give back. We want to step back. To do a new step forward.
Live, work and earn in harmony with nature.
And that brought us to La Granja Esavas. An idea was born. An idea, which has
become a concept, and subsequently to a project: our farm La Granja Esavas in Spain.
Live and give.


¡Retorno al origen!Our farm will be a place for everyone. For humans, for animals, for nature
itself. Giving old and younger donkeys a home. Bringing donkey therapy closer to a broader audience. Provide the therapeutic benefits for physically, mentally and intellectually disabled children and adults (as in ADHD, PTSD). Give people a place to calm. Cool down from a Burnout. Or to prevent it.

Breed ostriches.
Work on fields, produce products to sell on site, on markets and in our online
shop.We, Gabriela and Hermann, have the power, the willingness and the knowledge to let La Granja Esavas come true.
We have profound knowledge AND experiences in following branches: health care and health
products, medical care and products, burnout prophylaxes, IT technologies,
marketing technologies, craft experiences, agriculture, cattle breeding and
more.
 
But one thing we are missing to let this come true: the financial
resources.
And that’s the part where you supporters come in ;)
Your part is essential to this project. With your contribution we can start and
expand our centre and offer. See our “donkey puzzle”.

Thank YOU for your support! 
¡Gracias por tu apoyo! 
Vielen Dank für Ihre Unterstützung! 
Ďakujeme za vašu podporu!
Gabriela & Hermann



Why La Granja Esavas needs YOUR help
Crowdfunding is an absolutely wonderful way having our fans included to
the project. Not only do we want our community to feel being a part of this
process, we invite you to give us feedback and ideas and help us perfect our
concept.
One thing that has been very very important to us from the early stages
of planning is to stay away from loans of any kind at start-up. Starting a
business in debt adds an enormous amount of pressure to succeed. It's been a
long hard road and we've still got a ways to go, but this is our goal. Doing
things such as working overtime, cutting personal spending, sourcing used
equipment, building some of our own equipment, selling a beloved vehicle, and
getting some very gracious assistance from friends have been crucial to making
this happen.
Our
main concern right now is having the money available for buying a farm and
fields. We have decided to buy and own an old traditional Finca where we have
to do a lot of renovation work. We are aware of that we've a lot of work ahead
of us, but we are definitely up for the task. This is not the first time for
us, doing tasks like plumbing, electricity, heating, building, painting and
doing woodwork by ourselves, we feel that it is perfect for us. We are
extremely excited about breathing new life into a place with rich history - in
our new home. However, history comes with a price. With your help, we can ease
the financial burden of buying and building renovations a bit.
This
will allow us to focus more on our equipment, like special saddles and carts for disabled kids and adults, and gathering more knowledge and
information. We have already collected huge amount of stuff and information we
will need at start-up and are hard at work perfecting an initial collection of
recipes. We just need a place to make it all come together.



Budget & Schedule
The
money we raise with this campaign will be used towards opening La Granja Esavas
from the ground up.
We want to be in full re-construction of the property by late autumn this year
and we aim to open by spring-summer 2016. Our plan is also to have all the La
Granja Esavas brand merchandise available to buy from us and from an online
store at our website.


Planned Features at La Granja Esavas
Already said earlier, we would like to create a place for people and
animals. A place in nature, for nature and with nature.
That are our main goals we want to achieve:

Give old and/or deferred donkeys a graceful
     home. With plenty of space and stables.
Donkey therapy (Asinotherapy) is a therapy
     where donkey is the principal support.
Animal Assisted Therapy (AAT) to improve social, emotional, or cognitive functioning.
Burnout prophylaxes trainings, for individuals
     or small groups.
For team building and motivational effectiveness, for groups 
to bond with donkeys, alpacas, sheep, rabbits and more.

Courses about herbs and spices, tea creation,
     healthy eating, … all done in the fields
Breed donkeys and let kids have fun with them
Ostrich breeding
On site and online shop, for our goods and
     merchandize
Vacation home in a private environment
A place where you have the possibility to volunteer






What YOU will GET
We had long sessions thinking and discussing about the packages which we
should offer you. They have to be attractive, useful and related to our project.
Finally we created some which will be outstanding enough encourage you to
support our project. Hopefully.
There are still ideas and concepts for additional packs, the mystery
ones, which we will release later on.
Also planned is a referral campaign with some great merchandize. There's more to come.



This is the No 1 of 3 special designed t-shirts. A standalone pack.Designed by an artist and each single 3D design is limited to 111 pcs. No further distribution on our shop. 11 pieces will be held for social events & sponsoring.So here's the only chance to get one of them.No 2 will be released as soon as No 1 is gone, and so on. So order now and stay tuned not to miss the other two great designed E-Tees.No 1 is designed with the ""Green Esavas"" logo which we are using for our natural and traditional products. Green leaves are gently falling down the tree. 3D design.

Challenges & Risks

Family and friends, also other people have been asking us if we are sure
going on to realize this big step in our life. Our answer was, and is always:
YES. This has already started as a “project” in our mind years ago. From a
simple daydream, talking about our thoughts, Gabriela and I started to realize
this. There are many risks and challenges.
Our biggest challenge that we have right now is collecting the funds for
buying the farm and fields, our first donkeys and ostriches and to get over the
first year.
There are always risk and challenges, in private life as in business,
but we have a good condition, a good business plan and the knowledge and
willingness to start and continue such a project, we are well prepared.
Beside our actual work, we have started to learn Spanish, improved our
knowledge in farming, product knowledge. We also did, and are still doing, some
kind of market analysis. Just to be informed about the actual market situation
in the branch which we are stepping in. And of course, creating something new
and different combined with the standard, traditional goods.
We both have the strength and willingness to do that. And we have shown
this in the past. When we have married, we started with nothing. No, sorry, we
had debts. But within 6 years we come from a rented 1 room apartment up to a
small owned house, have good jobs and our 2 great kids.
Also our skills, paired with above qualities, let us drive in bringing
this project up and running.
Each single Euro will bring us closer, realizing La Granja Esavas.
Now we already thank you for your support! Whatever kind!



Frequently asked Questions
  Have a question?

Ask your ...
Well, joke, look at the FAQ (below)  first.
If your question isn’t answered here, then ask us.
If you ask a question, be patient.  We’ll respond as fast as we can, but there are a lot of you sending email, and  only two of us. But, we’ll get there.

Q: Do you know what you are doing?
A: Sometimes not! But in this case – YES! We know that we will have to use our hands. Give all the power of our bodies. Get up early – go to bed lately.
Q: Do you own the knowledge of what are going to do /provide?
A: Yes. We had worked hard at different farms already. We know how to breed, how to feed and how to work with animals. Especially with cows, pigs, poultries and rabbits. We are right now learning at ostrich farms and from other, befriended farmers.
Also, we have the knowledge of herbs, spices, fruits, vegetables, corns and flowers. How to seed and further food production.
Q: What if you fail to reach the farm goal?
A: Well,
as we have staggered milestones (description available on esavas.es) for
getting the funds to start our business, we will strengthen our work and do our utmost to achieve our final goal.
But in that case we can start the production of our own teas and other products
where we get the ingredients from least fields near us and from befriended
farmers. Some packs cannot be fulfilled then, but we will find a solution for
that. The remaining funds will be held and added to our income and additional
funding projects till we will receive enough to buy our Finca.
Q: Can I trust you?
A: Good question! But we can put your mind at ease: we have a good reputation, we are keeping our promises and that is also important for having good friends.
Q: Why are you not selling your home now?
A: Our house will still stay as the home for our kids, as they will still stay at the house and continue working at their companies.
Q: When will the packages be delivered?
A: We start delivering packs and give more information and details on the delivery after the campaign. As soon as the Merchandise is made available to us, we will be sending out all the post cards, merchandises & teas. This will be a few months from now. This is an ongoing campaign after this 60 day soft launch, so don’t worry we will still be going strong with regular updates to you.

</h3>FireTracks is a First Responder tracking and locating system.  FireTracks will seamlessly track and locate all on-site personnel in 
real-time.  Firefighters are equipped with beacons that constantly transmit a unique signal that identifies each individual firefighter with their location inside the building.  The beacon signals are relayed to the Antenna Array outside, where they are then converted into an X,Y, Z coordinate.  After conversion the signal is sent to the 3D Building software and displayed on a laptop.<br/><br/>Our goal is to improve upon Fire Fighter safety everywhere.</div><div>

FireTracks is a First Responder tracking and locating system.  FireTracks will seamlessly track and locate all on-site personnel in 
real-time.  Firefighters are equipped with beacons that constantly transmit a unique signal that identifies each individual firefighter with their location inside the building.  The beacon signals are relayed to the Antenna Array outside, where they are then converted into an X,Y, Z coordinate.  After conversion the signal is sent to the 3D Building software and displayed on a laptop.Our goal is to improve upon Fire Fighter safety everywhere.



How it Works
At the scene of a fire or disaster:
1. Firefighters attach the IP3 Beacon to their Turn-Out gear before heading out onto the fireground.2. Immediately, the IP3 Beacon begins transmitting a unique signal.  The signal is picked up by the Multi-Channel Antenna Array and is then converted into an X,Y, Z coordinate.3.The coordinates are then sent to Command for display on a laptop with our 3D Indoor Building wire-frame software.4. Command can then view on screen the exact location and position of firefighters, and track their whereabouts.





Current Firefighter Accountability Systems


There are basically two or three types of FF Accountability.  
Fire Chief Fred WindischFire Chief, Ponderosa Fire Dept, Houston, TexasThe current accountability systems for firefighters really depend on the individual fire department, the size of the department and also their budget:
1.  Velcro Name Patches - Passport System:  below is an image a ""Passport Collector"".  Firefighters place their name (Passport) on a board (Collector) on their way into a fire.  Officers know with a glance who is still inside and unaccounted for.


                                
2.  Fire Tags: The firefighter name is engraved into a metal fire tag.  The tag is hung up on a rack while the firefighter is unaccounted for.                                       3.  Electronic Beacon:  the firefighter attaches the beacon to their Turn-out gear.  If a firefighter stops moving the beacon will emit an ear-piercing siren to attract the attention of nearby firefighters.  Included is a powerful strobe-light to help other firefighters locate the individual.  A panic button is generally included.  None of these system can locate a firefighter.     Features of the FireTracks System




Both the IP3 Beacon and the S&R Finding Unit are made of 
fire-resistant and waterproof material that enables them to be reliable 
in any situation.
They are equipped with a rechargeable Li-ion battery with a fully-charged battery life of 6-hours.
Both devices are light weight and durable.

                                              The IP3 Beacon                            
The IP3 Beacon is equipped with an Emergency Siren and LED lights to ensure that the firefighters are found.
The IP3 includes an emergency button that firefighters can press if they need help.


                                                            The S&R Unit                                      

The S&R Unit can accurately guide the Search & 
Rescue team directly to the position of the trapped or injured 
firefighter.
The S&R Finding Unit lets the Rescue team know what floor they are on, it  guides them to the firefighter, and how shows how close they are to the firefighter.


FireTracks in Action

If a firefighter stops moving or activates their emergency button: 
1. Command is immediately notified (their icon turns red).  Search & Rescue Teams are dispatched to the firefighters location.  Our goal is to locate the individual with a less than 3-meter accuracy.
2. Search and Rescue Teams will use the S&R Finding Unit to accurately navigate through the building to reach the injured or trapped firefighter. 




Where Will the Money Go?

There are several ""big ticket"" items that need to be done.  They include Industrial Design, miniaturization of the components, UL Approval, Bill of Materials, raw materials purchase, a limited manufacturing run, assembly, testing, software programming... and then live, real-world testing!  

Finalize Latest Designs / create Bill of Materials = $5,000Industrial Design = $45,000Product Testing  = $50,000  (UL Approval & 500-degree burn test)Limited Manufacturing run =  $50,000Risks & Challenges 
Even though we are experimenting with our third-generation prototype, there is never 100% guarantee of success.  We need to bring all of the components together and manufacture a complete system for real-world testing.
Research and Development is expensive.  Conquering new frontiers is expensive.  Money is obviously one of our challenges.  We've been self-funded for the past 6 years.  It's time to find an investor (or community) that will help us bring this life-saving device to market.  Our lead Technical Specialist has spent decades designing and testing frequencies, antennas, and electronics. A break-through moment for us was receiving a signal through 7' of solid concrete.

Timeline for FireTracks





The Future of FireTracks

In addition to firefighters, this
same technology could be adapted to help track and locate Police, SWAT, Soldiers, Alzheimer's Patients and maybe Coal Miners.  If successful with our campaign we hope to pursue other applications and features. 
The FireTracks System can not only keep track of all on-scene personnel,
 
								we are also working on a system that will monitor the 
firefighters vital-signs and conditions along with their location back to
 Command.

Bottom line is that each phase will deliver to your body the top ingredients for unparalleled performance.When you put so much stock in top-shelf ingredients, you need the best facility to back you up.  Our lab’s multi-million dollar state-of-the-art cGMP certified, 150,000 square foot facility is one of the best, if not the best pharmaceutical manufacturing facility and lab in the world. We inbound test each and every raw material that comes into our facility for quality and do a full in-line testing from start to finish. In addition, our lab is a drug, steroid free facility and certified with: FDA Registered Facility, USDA Certified Facility, Safe Quality Food, Informed-Choice, and NSF.Our commitment to quality goes beyond the top. Our lab's control standards are set up and followed through every phase of product development. From the moment the raw materials enter our plant until Torque HD is finished, we ensure every batch meets our incredibly high standard of excellence.Our goal from day one is to produce the BEST supplement out in the marketplace. But not only the best in terms of quality and type of cutting-edge ingredients but also the best in terms of ease of use, transportability, and time saving. We have strategically and purposely designed our product to be used in precisely three different stages of your workout- Pre, Intra and Post.With our ingenious easy-to-transport and easy-to-pour packet system, Torque HD is the ultimate supplemental product in the marketplace. No more lugging bulky containers and most importantly no more messy scooping or pouring. Just tear each packet before, during, and after each workout or competition and empty the cutting-edge supplement into a shaker cup filled with water and you're good to go. It couldn't have been made any easier!Our laser-focused primary goal with this campaign is to raise enough funds to pre-order a minimum requirement of 166 boxes of Torque HD to begin manufacturing in earnest! Funds are also being used to ensure adequate samples to our distributors and future customers/distribution partners. If we earn enough, we will also be supporting our sponsored athlete Richard LeRoy and his mission to become a Champion Fighter! Online marketing, social media marketing, and website maintenance round out our launch costs. Your help is crucial in the success of bringing this game changing product to market! Thank you for supporting Torque HD through becoming a backer and by sharing this campaign all across social media!

<h2>What is MOTi good for?</h2>
<p><b>MOTi is ideal for gym workouts such as: sit-ups, push-ups, pull-ups, deadlifts, bench press, rolls, and more.</b></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1158456/files/20150119013737-Kickstarter_Content-07.png?1421660257"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<p>MOTi consists of 3 parts: <b>the core, the clasp and the strap</b>. </p>
<p><b>The removable core:</b> It is unibody and made of <b>aluminum</b> which gives it a <b>premium, luxurious</b> look and is available in four colors: <b>McLaren Flash (hot orange), A Grape Affair (mysterious purple with metallic sheen), Victoria's Secret Hot (honeysuckle pink with metallic sheen), Shades of Grey (silver grey).</b></p>
<p>Besides the well-rounded metallic design by our iF and Red Dot Award-winning team, on the outer rim of the core is a circle of light. It glows in different colors and serves as an indicator for actively logging and tracking, charging and connecting.<br/></p>
<p><b>The Clasp:</b> The core has smart clasping mechanism so that it can be easily turned to a different direction that is aligned with the gravity force of various workouts and therefore users won't have to own more than one tracker device with multiple straps in order to detect the specific movement performed.</p>
<p><b>The Strap:</b> In order to make it lightweight, water-resistant, sweat-proof, breathable and comfortable with maximum stretch ability and durability, we tested a lot of options and finally decided on adopting the second-skin-esque diving bodysuit fabric.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1168444/files/20150122223639-Kickstarter_Content-09_copy.png?1421994999"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>In addition to the sleek appearance, <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">MOTi also uses motion sensing inertial measurement unit sensors to detect movement and force of motion. Its uniquely designed signal processing and algorithm is also the key to recognize the types of workout users are having and log them. All data will be synced automatically to your smartphone or tablet via Bluetooth.</span></p>

<h2>Risks &amp; Challenges</h2>
<p>Different from the usual pedometer and activity tracker, MOTi is designed for hardcore fitness enthusiasts and bodybuilders. As a result, the precision required for detecting motion patterns and identifying various types of workouts is significant challenging, not to mention the fact that a lot of these workouts share similar motion patterns and each user may have his or her own pattern. In order to reach the utmost precision, we have invested a significant amount of time and effort in fine-tuning signal processing and recognition algorithms.</p>
<p>We have also tried to create a sleek device that includes all the major features without sacrificing its premium look. Fitting all those functions onto an extremely small circuit board with limited space is challenging enough itself and the metal housing that might affect the RF communication does not make it easier either. We also played around with various kinds of materials for the strap and to make sure it maintains the same quality and premium of the aluminum core. In a word, we are doing everything we can to make sure everything turns out as planned.</p>
<p>Besides the hardware part, the software- the APP is actually the heart and soul of MOTi. Users are able to log their workout, check out the highlights and details as well as uploading, sharing and managing their workout plans. We need your help creating the best user experience and enriching the MOTi fitness community with feedbacks and participation from professionals and enthusiasts all over the world.  Your participation is absolutely crucial to the success of this project and your support will be greatly appreciated.</p>

Redefining Fitness Wearables




Wearable tech is all the rage right now. Becoming healthier, getting into shape, toning up, losing weight, and moving a bit more each day are all the reasons for the over-crowded fitness tracker market right now and there are more turning up each day. Instead of trying to do everything, we strive to create something different, something that's more focused. We tapped into the gym world and wanted to create a device that specifically tracks our routines in the gym, knows how we are doing and how we can do better through new routines.  The followings are the major features of MOTi.
- TRACK & LOG: track movement and monitor details such as workout types, reps, activities, intervals, and muscle quality. 
- COACH: integrate coaching routines created by professional trainers throughout the world.
- THE APP: The most important factor of a fitness tracker is not the hardware itself, but the insight and personalized service that users gain. We spent an enormous amount of effort in creating a sophisticated app that provides not only detailed personal gym stats but also coaching programs and personalized workout plans and routines.
- DESIGN: MOTi is made of water-resistant wet-suit material and aluminum and therefore has a premium look. It is sleek as it is functional.
- ON-TIME DELIVERY: No more wondering when you can receive the product or waiting for another year to receive the product you purchase. We have all of our production line and manufactures ready and all we need is your support in improving the user experience and forming a greater fitness community. 







MOTi LOG: Your Workout Journal that Tracks & Logs Gym Sessions

MOTi is not just a fancy pedometer, it differentiates between the various types of workouts you are having, from sit-ups to deadlifts. It also tracks reps, calories burnt and muscle quality. 
MOTi LOG measures what matters. These insights are extremely helpful to your training and can save you from muscle injury from your next workout.
It tracks all your activities, whether it’s a workout session at the gym or just some push-ups or pull-ups at home, it knows what you’re doing and how many reps and sets you’ve done for each and tells you which muscle has been trained the most and which ones are weaker and need to be improved. 
In a word, MOTi knows yourself better than you do.
MOTi is also the ultimate gym wearable that coaches you through your workout sessions.
It is a fitness device designed specifically to motivate and enhance your workout experience at the gym and comes with an aluminum core and a snap-it-on strap that allows you to wear on either wrist/ankle, arm, or thigh. Snapping it on is just sexy and by wearing it on different position, it automatically tracks all the important stats that matter in the gym, identifies types of workout, logs your reps, calculates calories burnt and recognizes muscle usage so you can be ready for your next workout. 
MOTi APP is also embedded with MOTi COACH fitness programs and MOTi POINT that turn workouts into competitive games. Earn points for working out and achieving fitness goals as well as motivating yourself and pushing yourself to the limit. 
Get into a friendly competition with your fitness buddies, learn your progress and get better everyday.

Design & Specs



MOTi consists of 3 parts: the core, the clasp and the strap. 
The removable core: It is unibody and made of aluminum which gives it a premium, luxurious look and is available in four colors: McLaren Flash (hot orange), A Grape Affair (mysterious purple with metallic sheen), Victoria's Secret Hot (honeysuckle pink with metallic sheen), Shades of Grey (silver grey).
Besides the well-rounded metallic design by our iF and Red Dot Award-winning team, on the outer rim of the core is a circle of light. It glows in different colors and serves as an indicator for actively logging and tracking, charging and connecting.
The Clasp: The core has smart clasping mechanism so that it can be easily turned to a different direction that is aligned with the gravity force of various workouts and therefore users won't have to own more than one tracker device with multiple straps in order to detect the specific movement performed.
The Strap: In order to make it lightweight, water-resistant, sweat-proof, breathable and comfortable with maximum stretch ability and durability, we tested a lot of options and finally decided on adopting the second-skin-esque diving bodysuit fabric.



In addition to the sleek appearance, MOTi also uses motion sensing inertial measurement unit sensors to detect movement and force of motion. Its uniquely designed signal processing and algorithm is also the key to recognize the types of workout users are having and log them. All data will be synced automatically to your smartphone or tablet via Bluetooth.




With visually appealing and intuitive UI, the MOTi App is iOS-compatible and allows you to easily track, monitor and understand your workouts as well as setting up personal fitness plans, goals and reminding you of your progress. 
Please see the detailed specs as follows.

Risks & Challenges
Different from the usual pedometer and activity tracker, MOTi is designed for hardcore fitness enthusiasts and bodybuilders. As a result, the precision required for detecting motion patterns and identifying various types of workouts is significant challenging, not to mention the fact that a lot of these workouts share similar motion patterns and each user may have his or her own pattern. In order to reach the utmost precision, we have invested a significant amount of time and effort in fine-tuning signal processing and recognition algorithms.
We have also tried to create a sleek device that includes all the major features without sacrificing its premium look. Fitting all those functions onto an extremely small circuit board with limited space is challenging enough itself and the metal housing that might affect the RF communication does not make it easier either. We also played around with various kinds of materials for the strap and to make sure it maintains the same quality and premium of the aluminum core. In a word, we are doing everything we can to make sure everything turns out as planned.
Besides the hardware part, the software- the APP is actually the heart and soul of MOTi. Users are able to log their workout, check out the highlights and details as well as uploading, sharing and managing their workout plans. We need your help creating the best user experience and enriching the MOTi fitness community with feedbacks and participation from professionals and enthusiasts all over the world.  Your participation is absolutely crucial to the success of this project and your support will be greatly appreciated.

Education And Resource Team) We are an inter-educational coalition of health care
teams that service the Dominican Republic. The goal of our program is to
provide both acute and chronic, free medical care in
an impoverished community in the Dominican Republic. As a program created and financed by students,
our volunteers are dedicated and adept in the basics of diagnostician work. It
is a beautiful system where international students work hand-in-hand with local

<p>It was three and a half years ago when I was listening to a popular talk show host, who was speaking on having to import 
coconut oil from The Philippines for her restaurant, when we have so 
many coconuts just going to waste here in The Bahamas.    It was at that 
moment that I asked myself,  “How do you make coconut oil?”     And thus, 
Vennie's Natural Factory was created.      <br/></p>
<p>I started with organic cold-pressed coconut oil and now I produce organic coconut flour, butter, chips, sweetened condensed coconut milk and shredded
 coconut, all made from our locally grown coconuts.      My company is the first and only to produce all of these products in The Bahamas.</p>
<p>I am asking for funding to purchase three coconut processing machines that will de-husk, de-shell, and de-skin the coconuts.    Manually processing coconuts is both exhaustive and time consuming, limiting my production capacity.  <br/></p>
<p>The funding will also be used to purchase and import 100 cases of glass jars for my coconut oil, butter, and condensed milk.     Our only local bottling company was recently destroyed by fire.    Importing a large number of jars will help to keep my packaging costs low.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
</div> <div> <h3>What I Need And Why I Need Your Help.<br/>
</h3> <p>Since starting Vennie's Natural Factory, I have learned that it is  
impossible to obtain small business financing here in The Bahamas.  
Thus,
 I have decided to take matters into my own hands and seek crowd funding
 from people who believe in my business, products and vision.</p>
<p>My goal is to raise $5,000 to purchase coconut de-husking, de-shelling, and de-skinning machines and 100 cases of glass jars.    Much more funding is needed, but this will help us to immediately increase production.<br/></p>
<p>These 3 machines will significantly increase production, which will allow me to keep up with the growing demand for my organic products.     After three and a half years 
of manually processing coconuts, I am quite frankly, TIRED!  :)   There is a much better 
way...machines!<br/></p>
<p>The total cost of all 3 machines is $4,200, not including shipping.     The cost of 100 cases of glass jars will cost $611.  </p>
<br/>
</div> <div> <h3>It's All About Coconuts!</h3>
<p>The coconut is considered to be a superfood.    The coconut oil's unique combination of fatty acids can have profound positive effects on health, from healing skin disorders such as 
psoriasis and eczema, to helping to improve insulin levels in diabetics.    <br/><br/>Vennie's Natural Factory's coconut products are made from Bahamas wild-grown native 
and organic coconuts.     Our cold-pressed coconut oil, flour, butter, chips, and 
shredded coconut do not contain any added salt or sugar, additives or 
preservatives.   They have the natural sweet aroma and taste of 
coconuts.    Our sweetened condensed coconut milk is made with USDA certified organic cane sugar, with vitamin C added as  a natural preservative.    All of our products are gluten-free.<br/><br/>Although there are several persons 
producing coconut oil in The Bahamas, Vennie's Natural Factory is the only company that 
produces six products made from the coconut.    Our plan is to process 
the entire coconut, including the husks (organic coconut coir mulch) and the shells (organic activated charcoal).    Thus, 100% of the coconut will be used, leaving no wastage.<br/><br/>Our source of raw material is sustainable, since no trees are destroyed in 
the harvesting of the coconuts.    We use only dry coconuts, which are just 
picked up off the ground after they have fallen from the trees.    We also use eco-friendly and biodegradable packaging as much as we can. <br/></p>
<p>We do not use imported coconuts, even though the cost would be less.    Our main reason for this is to not become dependent on imports.   Secondly,
 purchasing coconuts locally will help to stimulate economic 
growth on our family islands, where jobs are scarce.    Thirdly, purchasing coconuts locally decreases our carbon footprint, a benefit to the global environment.    The closest coconut exporting country (Jamaica) is a minimum of 600 miles away.<br/></p>
<p>The coconuts in my country have been going to waste for decades, until 
now.    Other countries have been producing organic coconut products for years.   With the progress of Vennie's Natural Factory, The Bahamas is now entering the market.</p>
<p>Even though the local community is not familiar with coconut products, the  demand has been quickly increasing.    Our products are now being sold at 7 retail stores in Nassau and Eleuthera.    A restaurant (The Rock House) in Eleuthera  has created a new lobster dish made with our coconut butter.     The biggest news to date, our major grocery store chain (Super Value) has just recently approved our coconut oil and coconut butter for their 2 prime store locations.   It has taken almost 2 years to acquire this shelf space, and I am very excited!      With this new addition, increasing production has become imperative.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p> </div> <div> <h3>Current Challenges</h3>
<p>Producing  coconut products involves many steps and is very time consuming.   Currently, we can only process a maximum of 300 coconuts per week.     With the processing machines, we will be able to process 2,000 coconuts per week.     Increased production and sales will allow us to expand our product line and business, hire staff and more coconut suppliers.    This will provide additional income to persons in The Bahamas, where there is a high unemployment rate.<br/><br/>We previously purchased our glass jars 
from BAPAK, a local bottling company, which  was destroyed by fire 
on Christmas Eve.    The cost of the glass jars was 0.65 cents each.      Our cost to import 10 cases of glass jars increased the cost per jar to $1.90, with shipping, customs duty, and value added tax.    <br/></p>
<p>BAPAK was exempt from customs duties, since they were classified as a manufacturing company,    They also had the ability to purchase glass jars in large quantities, further reducing  their costs.     Since we are home-based, we cannot be classified as a manufacturing company, which would also exempt us from customs duties.    We certainly do not have the financial ability to purchase large quantities.    Even though we will still have to pay customs duties and VAT, purchasing 100 glass jars will reduce the cost per jar.     With increased production, we plan to be in our own processing facility, which will allow us to be categorized as a manufacturing company.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Donation Gifts</h3>
<p>Vennie's Natural Factory is making history here in The Bahamas.    For your help in during this very exciting time, we are offering unique combination of coconut gifts. <br/></p>
<p> International shipping from The Bahamas is very expensive, with the cost starting at $20 for the first pound only.    We have enlisted the help of a courier service in the US, to help minimize the shipping costs to the US &amp; Canada,      Once our campaign has ended,  using USPS online service, we will prepay the shipping costs for each gift.    All gifts will then be packaged in one box and shipped to the courier service, who will then deliver the individual donor gifts to a USPS location for shipping.     <br/></p>Donation gifts should arrive within 2 to  3 weeks of the end of my campaign.    Only local Bahamas, US &amp; Canada shipping is included in the donation gift price.   Donors from other countries can message us for a shipping cost estimate.<br/><br/>

many coconuts just going to waste here in The Bahamas.    It was at that 
moment that I asked myself,  “How do you make coconut oil?”     And thus, 
Vennie's Natural Factory was created.      
I started with organic cold-pressed coconut oil and now I produce organic coconut flour, butter, chips, sweetened condensed coconut milk and shredded
 coconut, all made from our locally grown coconuts.      My company is the first and only to produce all of these products in The Bahamas.
I am asking for funding to purchase three coconut processing machines that will de-husk, de-shell, and de-skin the coconuts.    Manually processing coconuts is both exhaustive and time consuming, limiting my production capacity.  
The funding will also be used to purchase and import 100 cases of glass jars for my coconut oil, butter, and condensed milk.     Our only local bottling company was recently destroyed by fire.    Importing a large number of jars will help to keep my packaging costs low.

  What I Need And Why I Need Your Help.
 Since starting Vennie's Natural Factory, I have learned that it is  
impossible to obtain small business financing here in The Bahamas.  
Thus,
 I have decided to take matters into my own hands and seek crowd funding
 from people who believe in my business, products and vision.
My goal is to raise $5,000 to purchase coconut de-husking, de-shelling, and de-skinning machines and 100 cases of glass jars.    Much more funding is needed, but this will help us to immediately increase production.
These 3 machines will significantly increase production, which will allow me to keep up with the growing demand for my organic products.     After three and a half years 
of manually processing coconuts, I am quite frankly, TIRED!  :)   There is a much better 
way...machines!
The total cost of all 3 machines is $4,200, not including shipping.     The cost of 100 cases of glass jars will cost $611.  

  It's All About Coconuts!
The coconut is considered to be a superfood.    The coconut oil's unique combination of fatty acids can have profound positive effects on health, from healing skin disorders such as 
psoriasis and eczema, to helping to improve insulin levels in diabetics.    Vennie's Natural Factory's coconut products are made from Bahamas wild-grown native 
and organic coconuts.     Our cold-pressed coconut oil, flour, butter, chips, and 
shredded coconut do not contain any added salt or sugar, additives or 
preservatives.   They have the natural sweet aroma and taste of 
coconuts.    Our sweetened condensed coconut milk is made with USDA certified organic cane sugar, with vitamin C added as  a natural preservative.    All of our products are gluten-free.Although there are several persons 
producing coconut oil in The Bahamas, Vennie's Natural Factory is the only company that 
produces six products made from the coconut.    Our plan is to process 
the entire coconut, including the husks (organic coconut coir mulch) and the shells (organic activated charcoal).    Thus, 100% of the coconut will be used, leaving no wastage.Our source of raw material is sustainable, since no trees are destroyed in 
the harvesting of the coconuts.    We use only dry coconuts, which are just 
picked up off the ground after they have fallen from the trees.    We also use eco-friendly and biodegradable packaging as much as we can. 
We do not use imported coconuts, even though the cost would be less.    Our main reason for this is to not become dependent on imports.   Secondly,
 purchasing coconuts locally will help to stimulate economic 
growth on our family islands, where jobs are scarce.    Thirdly, purchasing coconuts locally decreases our carbon footprint, a benefit to the global environment.    The closest coconut exporting country (Jamaica) is a minimum of 600 miles away.
The coconuts in my country have been going to waste for decades, until 
now.    Other countries have been producing organic coconut products for years.   With the progress of Vennie's Natural Factory, The Bahamas is now entering the market.
Even though the local community is not familiar with coconut products, the  demand has been quickly increasing.    Our products are now being sold at 7 retail stores in Nassau and Eleuthera.    A restaurant (The Rock House) in Eleuthera  has created a new lobster dish made with our coconut butter.     The biggest news to date, our major grocery store chain (Super Value) has just recently approved our coconut oil and coconut butter for their 2 prime store locations.   It has taken almost 2 years to acquire this shelf space, and I am very excited!      With this new addition, increasing production has become imperative.
   Current Challenges
Producing  coconut products involves many steps and is very time consuming.   Currently, we can only process a maximum of 300 coconuts per week.     With the processing machines, we will be able to process 2,000 coconuts per week.     Increased production and sales will allow us to expand our product line and business, hire staff and more coconut suppliers.    This will provide additional income to persons in The Bahamas, where there is a high unemployment rate.We previously purchased our glass jars 
from BAPAK, a local bottling company, which  was destroyed by fire 
on Christmas Eve.    The cost of the glass jars was 0.65 cents each.      Our cost to import 10 cases of glass jars increased the cost per jar to $1.90, with shipping, customs duty, and value added tax.    
BAPAK was exempt from customs duties, since they were classified as a manufacturing company,    They also had the ability to purchase glass jars in large quantities, further reducing  their costs.     Since we are home-based, we cannot be classified as a manufacturing company, which would also exempt us from customs duties.    We certainly do not have the financial ability to purchase large quantities.    Even though we will still have to pay customs duties and VAT, purchasing 100 glass jars will reduce the cost per jar.     With increased production, we plan to be in our own processing facility, which will allow us to be categorized as a manufacturing company.

 
Donation Gifts
Vennie's Natural Factory is making history here in The Bahamas.    For your help in during this very exciting time, we are offering unique combination of coconut gifts. 
 International shipping from The Bahamas is very expensive, with the cost starting at $20 for the first pound only.    We have enlisted the help of a courier service in the US, to help minimize the shipping costs to the US & Canada,      Once our campaign has ended,  using USPS online service, we will prepay the shipping costs for each gift.    All gifts will then be packaged in one box and shipped to the courier service, who will then deliver the individual donor gifts to a USPS location for shipping.     Donation gifts should arrive within 2 to  3 weeks of the end of my campaign.    Only local Bahamas, US & Canada shipping is included in the donation gift price.   Donors from other countries can message us for a shipping cost estimate.
  What Else Can You Do?
Please help to spread the word about
 our campaign.     Use the indiegogo tools or facebook and Twitter to let 
your friends, colleagues, communities and others know about Vennie's Natural Factory's mission.     Every person we reach can make a difference and help to get organic coconut products made in paradise on shelves and stores near you.  My fellow Bahamians, please continue to show your support by purchasing our  products.     I believe that our country is at a turning point, where many of us see 
the great value in locally grown and produced.   Help to make my unique
 idea a continued success by taking matters into your hands and funding 
my campaign.  Thank you.Vennie Y. EtienneOwner & Founder of Vennie's Natural Factorywww.venniesnatural.comwww.facebook.com/venniesnaturalfactory",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

Quench your eyeballs: https://openawg.github.io/Help support our effort to build and share affordable water generation technology for the most water poor regions of the world.We are a group of artists, engineers, and activists building open source AWGs (atmospheric water generators) [0] for testing in the BRD (Black Rock Desert). AWGs collect water vapor from the air and filter it for drinking, and are most commonly used in environments with 30% or higher humidity. This prototype and the data it collects will be open source and freely available for use by anyone, anywhere, for any purpose under the MIT license.The data gathered from the prototype is essential to scale our design for our larger version, openAWG v1, which will target a capacity of 1000L per day. It will serve as the centerpiece for a water-conscious art installation at Burning Man 2016. BRC (Black Rock City) has a low relative humidity and dew point, [1] and traditional dehumidifiers aren’t designed to operate in such an extreme environment. openAWG will be the only open source AWG to target this operating environment at a large scale.
[0]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_water_generator[1]: https://openawg.github.io/#faq
$50,000 is needed to build, transport, and test openAWG v0.

Non-exhaustive list of things we need:

parts

heat pump (compressors, heat exchangers, refrigerant lines)
sensors
plumbing
filtration
duct tape

materials
consumables (brazing rod, welding wire, structural metal)
HVAC tools

vacuum pumps
torches
pressure gauges
refrigerant

control system

hosting
build system
electronic stuff

operational

gasoline
trailer
generator rental

safety

work lights
several water tests (stupid expensive)

Any funds remaining from this operation will be rolled into the next phase, openAWG v1.
Currently, atmospheric water generators are only available through commercial entities.
By open sourcing water generation, we lower the barrier for individuals and organizations to not only utilize this technology, but also develop the engineering and operational experience for these and similar technologies. The software developed as part of openAWG will be extensible, and can be utilized for other soft real-time automation processes.
When an AWG is combined with carbon-negative biomass power sources [2], the result effectively locks away greenhouse gases in the form of potable water and carbon ash. [3]
We have already completed a smaller prototype called BlueIce, [4] and have reports from an EPA-certified lab analyzing the generated water. [5]

<li>We have not contracted out any of our work. Development of our database, videos and website, was all done in-house. Some  work had to be re-done as our computers slowed and crashed from the overload. We need to upgrade our equipment. This will make future work much more efficient.</li>
<li>Our software is protected with two copyrights. Our entire innovation is now covered with a pending patent. To make that patent permanent requires a search and other documentation. We have identified a well-qualified person who will undertake that task at a reasonable cost.</li>

<li>The National Institute of Health encouraged us to utilize our innovation to solve several health initiatives.

[Allocation: $250 Indiegogo, $250 Transaction Fees, $500 Perks, $1500 backend developer for coding, $1500 UI developer for coding, $1000 QA resource for testing]


If we hit our 1st stretch goal of $15,000, we will also be completely redeveloping key pages such as site registration with user experience in mind! They will be EASIER to use, and work great on a smartphone as well. This will require a User Experience designer's input AND back-end software development to the modules to change the current workflow. 
Thorough testing of every feature after the changes are made.
Moving the additional changes into production in Q1 2017

Stretch Goal #2 - $20,000

[Allocation: $250 Indiegogo, $250 Transaction Fees, $500 Perks, $4000 targeted email blasts and advertising]

If we hit our 2nd stretch goal of $20,000, we will focus all $4000 spreading the word about our new site launch with targeted email blasts and advertising with a goal of reaching old and new players!


Perks
Here are just a few of the cool perks we'll be giving away!





The Impact

 With a site redesign, everybody wins! Existing players will enjoy the new look and feel and the better design of the pages. And the new site will help us attract and retain more new players, too! And more players = shorter drive times + better competition. A winning formula for flex leagues!
    Risks & Challenges  We've already done the core design of the new site, and we will be implementing phase 1 over time, regardless of how much money we raise. However, it will take longer to do so and takes our focus away from the day-to-day fun of running the business. We want our players to benefit sooner, not later!   Other Ways You Can Help We realize that some folks who want to help, just don't have the extra funds. We understand! You can still help by helping us get the word out and making some noise about the campaign! So please share this campaign on social media and via email to your friends, family, and tennis buddies!!
Thanks so much and we can't wait to get our slick, responsive new site out to the masses!",2.0,0,"1 Campaign

is that your personal health data be kept anonymous</i>? 68% of respondents said
they would only share their data “<i>if privacy

<p>Similarly,
in an open-ended question asking participants “<i>Under what agreements and constraints would you share your health and

<p><b>Who we are:</b></p><p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Greetings! I'm Elisabeth McAllister, founder of Shine Your Light Yoga. I have a background in Montessori education, child development, and child advocacy. I've worked with children of all ages for over 20 years, and I truly love my work. Yoga has affected my own life in so many meaningful ways, and the journey has inspired me to share those gifts with as many children as possible. As much as I enjoy being in the classroom, nothing fills my heart with more joy than helping children learn to connect to themselves and become more mindful and peaceful in their daily lives.  I am now working full-time to expand Shine Your Light Yoga into a larger community of educators, administrators, parents, yoga instructors, and supporters of this mission. I believe that the stronger our team is, the brighter (and larger) we can grow. We can truly change the world by sharing these valuable tools with our children and the people leading them. </span></p><p><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); letter-spacing: 0px;"">Shine Your Light Yoga has humble beginnings. It started simply: me, a small group of children, and some big dreams. The children and parents loved the after-school yoga sessions I held, and semester by semester our class size grew. We began with one small group of students, and by the second year we were filling five classes per week. We also offered yoga camps for winter, spring, and summer break. In the classroom, I could see the children utilizing the mindfulness techniques they had practiced in yoga (which contributed to a more peaceful and focused environment). Parents often reported that their children had begun practicing yoga at home -- even teaching poses, meditation, and songs to their siblings. </span><br/></p><p><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); letter-spacing: 0px; font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">For more info on the benefits of yoga and mindfulness for children:  </span><a href=""http://www.autismparentingmagazine.com/creating-inner-peace-the-benefits-of-yoga-for-children-with-autism-spectrum-disorder/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" style=""letter-spacing: 0px; font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">http://www.autismparentingmagazine.com/creating-inner-peace-the-benefits-of-yoga-for-children-with-autism-spectrum-disorder/</a><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); letter-spacing: 0px; font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">   </span><br/></p><p><a href=""http://www.socialworktoday.com/archive/111511p8.shtml"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.socialworktoday.com/archive/111511p8.shtml</a><br/></p><p><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""><a href=""http://www.nchpad.org/881/5004/Yoga~in~the~Classroom~~A~New~Kind~of~Education"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.nchpad.org/881/5004/Yoga~in~the~Classroom~~A~New~Kind~of~Education</a><br/></span></p><p><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""><a href=""http://www.stillquietplace.com/mindfulness-for-children-no-fad-either-response-to-la-times-article/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.stillquietplace.com/mindfulness-for-children-no-fad-either-response-to-la-times-article/</a></span></p><p><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""><a href=""http://www.childmind.org/en/posts/articles/2012-4-9-power-of-mindfulness"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.childmind.org/en/posts/articles/2012-4-9-power-of-mindfulness</a></span></p><p><br/></p><p><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px; color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;"">How you can help</b><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;"">:</span></p>

<p>""Elisabeth brought Shine Your Light Yoga into our daughter's life. It has been a true light in all of our lives. Instill<span>ing the love of yoga in our daughter's heart is the most profound gift anyone could have given us and we are forever thankful to Elisabeth for doing that. Our daughter loves to do yoga, to show and teach us how to do the mountain pose, the tree pose and downward facing dog. She loves to give us meditation and to find energy between our eyes on our foreheads.Every time she sees us stretching she asks us if we are doing yoga and if we are feeling better after it. She teaches us how to take deep breaths when we are worried and say Om to de-stress. Our three year old daughter is more in-tune with herself than we ever imagined. The moments of meditation we all share together at home are one of the most relaxing, love-filled and calming moments in our lives. Our daughter is building life skills of being calm, centralized, peaceful and yet energized. Teaching our child to bow her head and say ""Namaste"" with all her intent in itself is immense to us.

<p><strong>What is MS?</strong></p>
<p>Multiple sclerosis is a nervous system disease that affects
the brain and spinal cord. It damages the myelin sheath, the material that
surrounds and protects the nerve cells. This damage slows down or blocks
messages between the brain and the body, leading to the symptoms of MS. They
range from numbness and tingling to blindness and paralysis. The progress,
severity and specific symptoms of MS in person cannot yet be predicted but advances in research and treatment are moving us closer to a world free of
MS.</p>

Potential Problem1) Ensuring chefs abide by federal food safety standardsSolution1) Require business insurance and credentials About the CreatorTonya Kinlow worked in Corporate America for 26 years.  Climbed the latter and rose to the Executive ranks at GE. After slugging away with seemingly no end in sight for what seemed like ever, you have to ask yourself, is this it? So what. Now what?  That's when Tonya and her husband, Chef Craig, started to dream. What was once a vision of a small 60-seater restaurant with warm decor and fresh casual comfort for a homemade feel quickly evolved. They saw how companies like Uber and AirBnB changed the landscape of business and they sought to do the same. This is how UGottaEat was born. UGottaEat is an app platform (technology) that gives everyone access to homemade and fresh made food on demand. You can conveniently share your home cooked meals within your network, AND find freshly-made meals from local chefs.

</h3><h3>Short Summary</h3><p>Hi,</p><p>I'm Walter Isom and I’m excited to share with the Home Fitness system I developed called the ""PWB"" Pro-Workout Bench.  I love to exercise but recently couldn't find the time to hit the gym.  I wanted something convenient and affordable, that could help improve my health and get me into shape, but I didn't want to go out and buy all those expensive and heavy weights.  With a background in engineering and project management, I set out to bring the PWB to the market place.  </p><p>The PWB is a customized workout bench that allows you to perform multiple exercises without weights.  By using our adjustable resistance bands, you can easily adjust them to just the right resistance and length you deserve.  You can perform the following exercises, just to name a few; Bench press, Military press, Seated rows, Curls, Inclines, and more.  In addition, the resistance bands can be detached from the bench and taken with you on-the-go when not at home.</p><p>The PWB production sample is complete.  However, being that this is a brand new product, I really need your support to help bring this product to the market.  I'd love for each of you to experience performing your favorite bench exercises without weights, just bands.</p><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Our funding goal is $45,000USD.  The product is being manufactured, offshore in China.  There are many cost involved that includes: Manufacturing cost, Patents, Tooling, Packaging, Shipping from China to USA, Customs, Warehousing, Order Fulfillment, and more.</p>
<p>We are asking for your SUPPORT in bringing this product to the market.  We've provided several great perks that are discounted for everyone who wants to support the campaign by purchasing the products.  You can support the campaign in two ways: Purchase products at a discounted rate or for those who may want to support the campaign but don't want a perk, you can simply make a contribution.  The contribution amount can be edited to any amount that you choose.</p>

<h3>About The Creator and the Puck</h3>
<p>I have a wonderful wife, fantastic toddler, and a fun loving dog that I get to spend my days with. We like to stay busy, and have a lot on our minds. In the midst of our everyday lives, just like yours, we tend to have things pop up related to our health. The dog has allergies, the kid gets an ear infection, and the wife and I should be taking our vitamins. Suddenly we have to remember to give the dog a dosage of allergy medicine at night. The kid needs amoxicillin a couple times a day for 10 days, and the wife and I should be taking our vitamins each and every night. This isn't even the most extreme case, and yet we tend to have a lot of conversations like the following:</p>
<p>Wife: ""Did you remember to give the dog the allergy medicine?""</p>
<p>Me: ""Ummm, I think so, or was that yesterday?""</p>
<p>Wife: ""Not sure. What about the amoxicillin? Did you do it yet tonight?""</p>
<p>Me: ""Not yet, did we remember to do it this morning?""</p>
<p>Wife: ""I THINK so. Hopefully"".</p>
<p>Me: ""I think you're right. How much of the amoxicillin are we giving again? When did we start it, should we be done today?""</p>
<p>Wife: ""Lets see we started on Wednesday the .......""</p>
<p>Why is it that we handle something as important to our health as medicine is, in this way? While I wish it wasn't the case, I know that we aren't the only ones doing this with our medications. We tried adding alarms and calendar events to our phones. They certainly help, but it is awfully easy to hit the snooze or cancel button, and suddenly you're back to trying to remember if you actually listened to the alarm. Maybe you were upstairs and hit cancel on your alarm, but your medicine was downstairs. So in a rush to get to work, you run straight out the door, and you still didn't take your medicine. It is this reason that I decided to try and build the ChillPill Puck. While it doesn't completely remove all risk, I think it is a great step in the right direction to remembering to take your medicine.</p>
<p>I think the Puck can simplify and improve the medication process. I think the puck reduces the likelihood that you will forget your medicine, because you have to pick up the container to make it stop reminding you. So if you are already physically picking up the medicine, I have to believe you are more likely to actually take it at that time. Instead of alarms on your phone that you can just snooze from anywhere, you have to go to the puck to make it stop. The puck also simplifies the process because you get to use the container the medicine comes in. I personally don't like having to bring medicine home in one bottle, to place it in a weekly or monthly planner. You have to individually fill up  your days, and I think that introduces a lot of risk. By having the bottles, with the puck, you can look right at the label, and make sure you are taking the right medicine and the correct dosage. Another aspect of the puck that makes life easier, is it not only reminds the person that needs to take the medicine, but anyone else in the house will see it to. That means if I need to take my vitamins, my wife can look and see that I haven't taken them yet, and tell me I need to. It allows for a group approach to staying healthy.</p>
<p>The application will add another layer of benefit to the ChillPill system, in that it will help you keep track of how many days are left. If you missed a day. If your wife missed a day. It can also let you know if you left the house without taking your medication. The app can add a ton of information to help keep you on track. While there might be apps out there already that do some of these things, the key is that it interacts with the ChillPill Puck to give you everything that you need. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We are looking to get funding to cover a few different pieces. The largest portion of the funding would be used to hire a professional to build the Application to interface with the Puck. While I have been able to create an App to use as part of the ChillPill system, I really want to make sure it is bulletproof and that all of the features that we want are included and makes the user, you, happy to be using it. The second portion would be to find ways to reduce the cost of the hardware manufacturing.  This would be the casing for the puck and the electronics. I want the Puck to be affordable for everyone who needs it. Finally I want to get this thing to market, so some of the funding would be used for marketing, and to set up shop. We have a great working prototype and I want to push it through so everyone can enjoy the benefits.</p>

<p>Hi! I'm Dr. Amin Samadian, a comprehensive and advanced dentist in San Francisco, Bay Area. During my clinical work and my teaching experience as a faculty member in one of the San Francisco dental schools, I realized that patients need transparency in their diagnoses and treatment planning and the current dental industry lacks a unanimous Standard of Care. To gain the knowledge of building a business I started my MBA program at UCBerkeley Haas School of Business  which I just finished and now I'm focusing on providing a platform to all the patients to have access to their diagnosis and treatment records everywhere they go. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Providing access and transparency in diagnosis and treatment planning and a quality control system in dental industry is very important to me as a healthcare provider that believes in excellence and a high standard of care. A lot of the times the patients who come to me for second opinions have been going to doctors for a long time and were unable to find a solution to their problems. I hope to be able to help my patients and all the other patients with similar concern to get access to a high quality center of doctors that review their records and give them diagnosis and treatment planning and also can review the quality of the work of other dentists for the patients. This can help millions of people because we believe in prevention and catching things early. Being dental emergencies the first cause of hospital emergency visits, if we can catch dental problems soon, and guide patients to verified healthcare providers to solve their problems, we can make people healthier and solve a lot of inefficiencies in our current healthcare model. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>I'm asking for your support to build a FREE HIPPA compliant cloud based electronic health record that you can use to store your data and have access to it everywhere you go. We need about $25,000 to finish the software. All the money goes towards software development and UI/UX so you can have a cool app. </p>
<p>This software will give you a secure database for all your treatment history and everything about your oral health and it will match your treatment needs with the best practitioner in your local area that is capable of giving you the best outcome for FREE. We will vet the doctors for you, we will make sure that they're updated in their technologies, treatment philosophy, materials, education etc. We will also provide you with quality control over your treatments at a minimal cost if you want, so you can rest assured that whatever treatment you receive from doctors are done properly at a high standard (which is often times impossible for the patients to know). </p>
<p> </p>
<p>I'm using my own income working as a successful full-time clinician in the Bay Area to develop this software and your contributions will help me immensely. I'm committed to bring a system for accountable, preventive, minimally invasive  dental care and elevate the Standard of Care in the Industry. If this campaign doesn't reach its goal, I'll keep bootstrapping it until we get you this free product. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Even if you don't think you'd be able to contribute now, spread the word and share this idea so everyone knows that they are entitled to access their health records and carry it with them and everyone is entitled to receive the highest Standard of Care. </p>

</div>","Goal : 10 000 $ Why another hair product?  Everything that I tried on my girls' hair bothered me. There was something not-quite-right: the scent, the texture, too sticky, too greasy... It was so hard to find a hair product that would do what it promised. Something that my girls loved, with natural ingredients and was adapted to their hair.What was missing? For me this is the key.  I want my girls to love their natural hair in all its frizzy, curly wonder. They need a hair product that is fun to use and smells great.  It should bring out the curls, not try to hide them.  They deserve something easy and pleasing to use every day, risk free. No more using products made for grown ups.  LES MIMIS is made by kids and for kids. Everything I make goes into the hands and onto the heads of my two children.  Believe me - they are tough customers.  Les MIMIS offers kids an alternative to straightening chemicals and synthetic extensions. We want everyone to know about our brand, LES MIMIS.Where does your money go? Your support will let us expand the LES MIMIS product line by creating a shampoo, a conditioner, a repair oil, a hair cream and a de-tangler.  We already have our first product ready, a moisturizing hair cream which de-tangles wet or dry hair.  The cream was developed in a lab by a team of chemists who care as much about using natural ingredients and caring for the environment as we do.With your help, we will continue the develop the brand and expand the product line. By supporting Les MIMIS, you will also be raising kids' self esteem by helping them to be proud of themselves and embrace who they are. We want kids to take care of their own hair and like it.You will also be helping families in Haiti achieve financial autonomy. 10 %
of this Indiegogo campaign (10 000 $ USD) will go to KANPÉ.  It will fund an 18-month program that enables families to achieve financial autonomy in a
sustainable way.  http://kanpe.org/en/See what the hair cream from Les Mimis can do!

We're on:  Facebook TwitterInstagramLes Mimis - It's for him.-------------------------------------Pourquoi je vous propose un énième produit pour les cheveux?
Tous les produits capillaires que j’ai essayés sur mes enfants m’ont laissé sur
ma faim. Je n’ai jamais trouvé de produits à base d’éléments naturels adaptés
aux cheveux de mes filles, qui les démêlent bien et qui correspondent à mes
valeurs.
Quelles sont ces valeurs? Que le produit respecte les
cheveux naturels. Qu’il mette en valeur les boucles. Qu’il ne soit pas toxique
pour la santé. Et que les enfants l’utilisent, voire jouent avec lui sans risque.Habituellement, on utilise des produits pour adultes sur les cheveux des enfants. Mais la gamme Les Mimis sois-toi est conçue par les enfants et pour les enfants.Les MIMIS - it's also for her.
Objectifs
Recueillir 10 000 $Faire connaître la marque et développer une gamme de
produits, dont un shampoing, un revitalisant et un traitement.

AnnMarie Appiah, founder of event planning company A.M.A. Experience, establish-ed the Painted Pink Campaign in September 2014. The campaign’s mission is to spread awareness on breast cancer and providing resources for prevention. 
Painted Pink was created to provide financial support to local charities offering aid and services to local Breast Cancer patients. Some of these benefiting charities include Emory Winship’s Cancer Institute and the Bold and Breastless Foundation.  These organizations work diligently in providing awareness and information, and in offering support in the prevention and treatment of breast cancer.
It is vital that everyone learn the importance of early detection,  and have access to information  and treatment of breast cancer.  Our local survivors are proof that we can overcome the battle  with Breast Cancer, through the support of the Painted Pink Campaign, and we can make a difference by giving the gift of hope, support, health and life...one survivor at a time. 
   How you can help   We strive to raise $3,000 to  financial assist  women fighting breast cancer. We would be honored if you could help us achieve this goal!  Emory Winship Cancer Institute will track how many families we have helped and impacted with our funds raised! So you will get a direct report of how you were apart of this movement.

<p style=""font-style: italic;"">I am a blessed person. I have excellent parents who did all they could to meet my needs, not only food and shelter but also plenty of love. Honesty, justice, gratitude, courage and politeness were values learned with them, who always motivated my actions and never tried to impose their will, letting my heart guide my decisions.</p>
<p style=""font-style: italic;"">At 11 years old I found my wife, Fernanda, the most sweet, mate, honest, caring and full of faith person I have ever met. Due to the grace of God we got married 14 years later, after more than a decade of platonic love.</p>
<p><i>In 1991 I stablished a goal in my life: to be admitted in one of the three best universities of Electrical Engineering in Brazil. Contrary to most people of my hometown, a small village 450 miles away from São Paulo (most important city in Brazil), after 12 months studying alone from 6:30am to 5:30pm and still attending the last school year at night, I was admitted for a top 5 (UNESP), but I was</i><i> not satisfied yet.

<p style=""font-style: italic;"">After my degree I went to Hungary for an internship at Technical University of Budapest, analysing the dynamic behavior of type II high temperature superconductors.

<p style=""font-style: italic;"">The birth of my son in 2005 made me start to seriously think about leaving my job, in order to spend more time with him and my wife. One year later I raised my first company - Donna Fitness (currently the third biggest chain of women's only gyms in Brazil). In 2007, with a business still full of risks and contrary to 10 out of 10 colleagues, I resigned my job. From then 90% of my activities are done at home, enjoying my wife and children (in 2009 our little girl was born).</p>
<p style=""font-style: italic;"">In 2010 I began to realize something getting stronger within me, an urge to give back all graces I received in life. Then on a Sunday morning, I woke up in the middle of the night with an idea: how about developing simple and affordable solutions to the most killing diseases in the world? With it in mind I began to reformulate the project of a vibrating platform that I was developing for use in gyms, now focusing on diseases prevention, based on the available research results from the National Library of Medicine. After 3 years of development, dozens of prototypes and a well established supply chain, the SmartWalk was ready for the market.

</div></div>","Everyone agree on walking everyday as a good habit for a healthier life. Unfortunatelly not all of us have time and/or motivation to do it accordingly (rain, snow, cold or scorching sun are strong barriers). To solve this problem we created SmartWalk: a low cost vibration platform that stimulates your body with the same impact it has while walking, but +1,600 times per minute.There are +1,800 scientific researches about ""walking benefits"" and +1,500 regarding ""whole body vibration"", which covers from sinus relief to type 2 diabetes, osteoporosis and cardiovascular diseases prevention.



""Simplicity is the Ultimate Sophistication.""
Leonardo da Vinci

HOW IT WORKS




SmartWalk uses mechanical vibration to stimulate muscles, bones and stem cells as a walking does, but +1,600/minute, at home, with no effort, while you do many other things like reading, listening music, chatting or watching TV.

Hundreds of researches has proven the benefits of mechanical vibration on human body, including the drastic reduction of visceral fat (preventing type II diabetes and cardiovascular diseases) and the increase of bone density and flexibility.

</div><h1>Legal California medical cannabis business
recovering from raid, bank accounts frozen</h1><p><i><b>Assets Frozen.
 We need your help for our legal defense fund so we can fight for the 
future of the legal cannabis industry in California and America</b></i></p>
<p>On January 28, 2016 at
7:30 a.m., approximately 30 officers in body armor, helmets and carrying
automatic weapons, sledgehammered the front door of Med-West, a San
Diego-based company that makes legal cannabis-based medicines for legal
dispensaries in California.</p>
<p>Interestingly enough,
the local news media knew about the raid and splashed the news over the 
public
airwaves. They reported that the officers had a search warrant for a 
suspected
“Hash Oil Lab”. Cash was seized. Bank accounts were frozen. Two 
employees of
Med-West were handcuffed and detained for hours and later arrested. The 
officers gave each other high fives as they left the building with their
 haul.</p>
<p>Just another drug
bust?</p>
<p>No. It wasn’t.</p>
<p>Med-West is a legal business, that is highly regulated. Trusted in 
the cannabis industry and led by a cannabis pioneer who has helped 
influence national drug policy in multiple states.</p>
<p>James Slatic, a serial entrepreneur and CEO of San
Diego based business Med-West Distribution, LLC, wasn't at the building 
during the raid and has not been arrested or charged. Slatic created the
 company to make and sell CO2
extracted medical cannabis products, including vape pens and cartridges.
 Slatic is part of the movement
that wants to help create a great new American industry, and to stop 
putting
people in jail for this helpful plant.</p>
<p>He has an
entrepreneurial vision of helping people and raising awareness of the 
many options of medical cannabis and giving back to be of service
to this new industry. James was a founding member of the National 
Cannabis
Industry Association, and founding board member of California Cannabis 
Industry, and
Nevada Cannabis Industry Associations, sits on the Board of Marijuana 
Policy
Project, and is a regular speaker at industry and activism events for 
CalNorml
and Drug Policy Alliance.</p>
<p>Med-West medicines are
not the crude products of yesteryear. Rigorous laboratory testing, in a
city-licensed facility, is done throughout to ensure proper potency and
purity. Importantly, Med-West cannabis oil products are produced within strict
adherence to state laws using a CO2 extraction method. And importantly, NO CO2 extraction took place at this facility.</p>
<p>Med-West does not sell
their products to individual patients, only in wholesale to licensed
dispensaries. City officials in San Diego were regular visitors to the 14,000
square-foot facility. Even police officers had stopped by for a visit earlier
in the year. But just a few weeks after a new statewide law, that Slatic helped
write and pass, took effect a local DA preformed a ""smash and grab"" on Med-West, and
somebody called the media.</p>
<p><b>Follow the Money</b></p>
<p>The lives of James,
his wife and daughters and the employees of Med-West changed drastically on
January 28, 2016. </p>
<p>Law enforcement
personnel raided Med-West took everything, in. All the companies products, raw materials, computers, hard
drives, laptops, files, tax and patient records were seized, along with a large
sum of cash due to be used for payroll and product purchases.</p>
<p>In the aftermath of
this raid, 21 employees are now out of work, and patients in the hundreds of
collectives we served were deprived of their medicine.</p>
<p>It appears that money for at least some of the personnel who planned 
and conducted the raid was paid from federal funds designated for 
homeland security ... to protect and defend our nation from terrorism.</p>
<p><b>Slatic’s Assets, Even Personal and Family Bank Accounts, Have Been Frozen </b></p>
<p>This includes his wife
and teenage daughters’ accounts as well. His wife, Annette, is a Federal
employee at the VA Hospital in La Jolla, and has nothing to do with the
business. Their daughter is a student at San Jose State, and could not even buy
food at school. According to his bank, this was done with nothing more than a
signed letter from a San Diego police detective. The bank will not provide his
attorneys with a copy of the reported court order, nor will the police or
D.A.’s office.</p>
<p><b>A Simple Request</b>
</p><p>Help us fight back by
contributing to the Med-West Legal Defense Fund.</p>
<p>With their assets
frozen, Slatic and his team need funds to pay attorneys, consulting experts, and
others who will help them fight back against this misguided raid.</p>
<p>An escrow account has
been established and fiduciary controls have been put in place to protect the
integrity of the funds raised. The funds will be used to pay attorney’s fees
and for the myriad of expenses that come along with a fight against the
government.</p>
<p>Financial support during this critical time will be deeply 
appreciated ... some in the industry have already promised to help once 
this fund is established ... but we would also appreciate small, 
individual contributions from people who share our belief in the 
fledgling American cannabis industry.</p>
<p>Truth is on our side. James Slatic and Med-West need those who believe in the American Cannabis industry
to provide them with the financial support they need to win this fight. If this
can happen in San Diego, California … it can happen anywhere.</p>

<br/></div>","Thank you so much for all the generous contributions we received during the first part of our legal defense campaign. We have used the funds towards our legal fees to get our assets back! We are set for a hearing on June 2nd to file a petition to try to get the assets that were seized during the raid and to unfreeze all personal assets as well. 


Legal California medical cannabis business
recovering from raid, bank accounts frozenAssets Frozen.
 We need your help for our legal defense fund so we can fight for the 
future of the legal cannabis industry in California and America
On January 28, 2016 at
7:30 a.m., approximately 30 officers in body armor, helmets and carrying
automatic weapons, sledgehammered the front door of Med-West, a San
Diego-based company that makes legal cannabis-based medicines for legal
dispensaries in California.
Interestingly enough,
the local news media knew about the raid and splashed the news over the 
public
airwaves. They reported that the officers had a search warrant for a 
suspected
“Hash Oil Lab”. Cash was seized. Bank accounts were frozen. Two 
employees of
Med-West were handcuffed and detained for hours and later arrested. The 
officers gave each other high fives as they left the building with their
 haul.
Just another drug
bust?
No. It wasn’t.
Med-West is a legal business, that is highly regulated. Trusted in 
the cannabis industry and led by a cannabis pioneer who has helped 
influence national drug policy in multiple states.
James Slatic, a serial entrepreneur and CEO of San
Diego based business Med-West Distribution, LLC, wasn't at the building 
during the raid and has not been arrested or charged. Slatic created the
 company to make and sell CO2
extracted medical cannabis products, including vape pens and cartridges.
 Slatic is part of the movement
that wants to help create a great new American industry, and to stop 
putting
people in jail for this helpful plant.
He has an
entrepreneurial vision of helping people and raising awareness of the 
many options of medical cannabis and giving back to be of service
to this new industry. James was a founding member of the National 
Cannabis
Industry Association, and founding board member of California Cannabis 
Industry, and
Nevada Cannabis Industry Associations, sits on the Board of Marijuana 
Policy
Project, and is a regular speaker at industry and activism events for 
CalNorml
and Drug Policy Alliance.
Med-West medicines are
not the crude products of yesteryear. Rigorous laboratory testing, in a
city-licensed facility, is done throughout to ensure proper potency and
purity. Importantly, Med-West cannabis oil products are produced within strict
adherence to state laws using a CO2 extraction method. And importantly, NO CO2 extraction took place at this facility.
Med-West does not sell
their products to individual patients, only in wholesale to licensed
dispensaries. City officials in San Diego were regular visitors to the 14,000
square-foot facility. Even police officers had stopped by for a visit earlier
in the year. But just a few weeks after a new statewide law, that Slatic helped
write and pass, took effect a local DA preformed a ""smash and grab"" on Med-West, and
somebody called the media.
Follow the Money
The lives of James,
his wife and daughters and the employees of Med-West changed drastically on
January 28, 2016. 
Law enforcement
personnel raided Med-West took everything, in. All the companies products, raw materials, computers, hard
drives, laptops, files, tax and patient records were seized, along with a large
sum of cash due to be used for payroll and product purchases.
In the aftermath of
this raid, 21 employees are now out of work, and patients in the hundreds of
collectives we served were deprived of their medicine.
It appears that money for at least some of the personnel who planned 
and conducted the raid was paid from federal funds designated for 
homeland security ... to protect and defend our nation from terrorism.
Slatic’s Assets, Even Personal and Family Bank Accounts, Have Been Frozen 
This includes his wife
and teenage daughters’ accounts as well. His wife, Annette, is a Federal
employee at the VA Hospital in La Jolla, and has nothing to do with the
business. Their daughter is a student at San Jose State, and could not even buy
food at school. According to his bank, this was done with nothing more than a
signed letter from a San Diego police detective. The bank will not provide his
attorneys with a copy of the reported court order, nor will the police or
D.A.’s office.
A Simple Request
Help us fight back by
contributing to the Med-West Legal Defense Fund.
With their assets
frozen, Slatic and his team need funds to pay attorneys, consulting experts, and
others who will help them fight back against this misguided raid.
An escrow account has
been established and fiduciary controls have been put in place to protect the
integrity of the funds raised. The funds will be used to pay attorney’s fees
and for the myriad of expenses that come along with a fight against the
government.
Financial support during this critical time will be deeply 
appreciated ... some in the industry have already promised to help once 
this fund is established ... but we would also appreciate small, 
individual contributions from people who share our belief in the 
fledgling American cannabis industry.
Truth is on our side. James Slatic and Med-West need those who believe in the American Cannabis industry
to provide them with the financial support they need to win this fight. If this
can happen in San Diego, California … it can happen anywhere.
What We Need & What You Get
We have the following
available for donors:

80 Silver California coins $1,000
70 Silver Nevada coins $1,000
20 Kayman Bikes™ Flash E-Bike for donors of $5000

to help
patients. Whatever we raise that is not used will go to help others in 
similar situations They are seeking to open (in a new location) for

First you put Hook'd on your luggage rack. Then you hang a shopping bag on the hook marked with the number one. Now gravity takes over and secures Hook'd to your luggage rack and you're ready to go.

<p>A few months ago, I decided to join Love Volunteers (<a href=""http://www.lovevolunteers.org/)"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.lovevolunteers.org/)</a> to volunteer at a medical centre located in a tea plantation in Badulla, Sri Lanka, where many Tamil tea workers work and live.  I will spend two weeks (+) volunteering in November, 2015 with the goal of helping provide medical care, learning about the Tamil workers' health condition, living/working situations, struggles, and their personal stories. I am looking to share my travelling and volunteering experiences on my website through photographs and words.</p>
<p><u>This campaign is to help generate fund for me to purchase some basic medical supplies (e.g. first aid kit, hand sanitizer, alcohol swabs) for the tea workers. </u></p>
<p><b>Who Are the Tamil People?</b></p>
<p>As one of the largest and oldest ethnic groups, Tamil people have been isolated and neglected socially, politically and economically for a long period of time. My trip to Sri Lanka aims to learn about the Tamils history, explore their current socio-economic status, and understand their daily struggles.  </p>
<p>My goal is to reach $500 at the end of July, 2015.  If I don't reach my entire goal, I will use the received fund, plus my own savings, to purchase the medical supplies needed.   If it manages to reach beyond my goal, then more medical and daily supplies for the Tamils!</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hi Indiegogo! I'm Raciel and I'm the inventor of The Natural Spine posture correction device. </p>
<p>At the age of 14 I was in the backseat of a car that was struck by a drunk driver. For the past 14 years, I've dealt with chronic back pain and poor posture. In 2016, I set out to do something about it. </p>
<p>Keeping active because it meant better spine health, after a group workout at my local gym, I opted for a cab ride home because I couldn't bear to wait for the subway. My lower back was <strong>throbbing. </strong>In the backseat of that cab, I put my water bottle behind my back to help my posture from being hunched over - which in turn was causing more pain. I expected for my spine to shift into a more upright position, to decompress.</p>
<p>What I didn't expect to happen was for my pain to completely melt away. If you're skeptical about pain ""melting away,"" I get it. I was too... Until it happened to me. I felt so weird. I couldn't remember a time that I was <i>not</i> in pain. I felt lightheaded and a faint sensation of vertigo came over me. It was like I was able to breathe again for the first time - that feeling you get when your lungs expand to their fullest capacity. In utter shock, and total pain relief, I began thinking of ways to bring this idea to life. I knew that if it helped me, it could help a lot of other people with back pain. </p>
<p>It started out very simple: testing out driving with two lacrosse balls placed in the area where I always hinge over, my thoracic (middle) spine. The lacrosse balls naturally stayed in place with the weight of my torso holding them up against the chair. After that proved successful, I began to sketch the initial concept.  My first design looked sort of like a home telephone, haha. Thank God for Engineers.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>We've since come a long way. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>Our Timeline: </strong></h3>
<p><strong>While conceptualized in the winter of 2016 and 2017, we started working on our first prototype in the summer of 2019. It looked like this: </strong></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1599778749/qndv7udqkwgzkz7qgpsc.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Filed for a Utility Patent: The Natural Spine is patent-pending.</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>Made some revisions on the backplate, creating pre-set settings for the pressure points. This makes it easier for you to target specific areas. </b></p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>Bought a 3D printer to print it ourselves and cut down on costs... but the printer... well, this happened: </b></p>
<p><b><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1599779064/her82zuk7amklfg18sv4.jpg"" src=""""/></b></p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>Realizing we needed help, we reached out to a local 3D printer who took us from the above image, through to the next two iterations: we added more sizes of the pressure points to test out different measurements and levels of comfort.</b></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1599779225/frmjjwgoupfj1wzc27tj.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Our pressure points cracked because the settings on the backplate were too tight. </strong></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1599779265/bhzqagtndq85cc9m87ph.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>We increased the size of the settings on the backplate to allow for more ease when sliding the pressure points to their desired settings. We upgraded the strap and buckle to make the entire process of fastening The Natural Spine to your chair much easier. </strong></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1600055713/hlx39gegbxzk8tagikb5.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Tested different materials for the pressure points... And made a HUGE mess. Silicone and paint got everywhere. (not shown here: silicone and paint, everywhere.)</strong></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1599780809/ycsly0z7axatrvoo34hp.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>When pouring different materials for the pressure points, we realized we may need to increase the size of the small stem that connects the pressure point to the backplate so that when you're adjusting the pressure points to your settings (there may be more than one setting for you, depending on your trouble areas), they don't break. While we are going with a firm rubber, a thinner stem was worrisome. So we increased the size of the openings on the backplate, and increased the thickness of the stem that holds the pressure point in place. </strong></p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We've suffered with poor posture and back pain for a long time. The Natural Spine is not a magical remedy that will heal you instantly. However, it <i>has </i>helped us by dramatically reducing our pain and discomfort, keeping our spine upright and in good form, and has made us more aware of keeping up with our posture when we're not using The Natural Spine. We are confident The Natural Spine can do the same for you. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Your contribution helps us to help others. We can't do this without you.</p>

<p><strong>When we learned that manufacturing takes a lot longer than expected: </strong>We refocused our efforts from trying to have products available this summer, to launch early next year.  We are currently expecting shipping to start March 1st, 2021.

Short Summary
Hi Indiegogo! I'm Raciel and I'm the inventor of The Natural Spine posture correction device. 
At the age of 14 I was in the backseat of a car that was struck by a drunk driver. For the past 14 years, I've dealt with chronic back pain and poor posture. In 2016, I set out to do something about it. 
Keeping active because it meant better spine health, after a group workout at my local gym, I opted for a cab ride home because I couldn't bear to wait for the subway. My lower back was throbbing. In the backseat of that cab, I put my water bottle behind my back to help my posture from being hunched over - which in turn was causing more pain. I expected for my spine to shift into a more upright position, to decompress.
What I didn't expect to happen was for my pain to completely melt away. If you're skeptical about pain ""melting away,"" I get it. I was too... Until it happened to me. I felt so weird. I couldn't remember a time that I was not in pain. I felt lightheaded and a faint sensation of vertigo came over me. It was like I was able to breathe again for the first time - that feeling you get when your lungs expand to their fullest capacity. In utter shock, and total pain relief, I began thinking of ways to bring this idea to life. I knew that if it helped me, it could help a lot of other people with back pain. 
It started out very simple: testing out driving with two lacrosse balls placed in the area where I always hinge over, my thoracic (middle) spine. The lacrosse balls naturally stayed in place with the weight of my torso holding them up against the chair. After that proved successful, I began to sketch the initial concept.  My first design looked sort of like a home telephone, haha. Thank God for Engineers.
 
We've since come a long way. 
 
Our Timeline: 
While conceptualized in the winter of 2016 and 2017, we started working on our first prototype in the summer of 2019. It looked like this: 

 
Filed for a Utility Patent: The Natural Spine is patent-pending.
 
Made some revisions on the backplate, creating pre-set settings for the pressure points. This makes it easier for you to target specific areas. 
 
Bought a 3D printer to print it ourselves and cut down on costs... but the printer... well, this happened: 

 
Realizing we needed help, we reached out to a local 3D printer who took us from the above image, through to the next two iterations: we added more sizes of the pressure points to test out different measurements and levels of comfort.

 
Our pressure points cracked because the settings on the backplate were too tight. 

 
We increased the size of the settings on the backplate to allow for more ease when sliding the pressure points to their desired settings. We upgraded the strap and buckle to make the entire process of fastening The Natural Spine to your chair much easier. 

 
Tested different materials for the pressure points... And made a HUGE mess. Silicone and paint got everywhere. (not shown here: silicone and paint, everywhere.)

 
When pouring different materials for the pressure points, we realized we may need to increase the size of the small stem that connects the pressure point to the backplate so that when you're adjusting the pressure points to your settings (there may be more than one setting for you, depending on your trouble areas), they don't break. While we are going with a firm rubber, a thinner stem was worrisome. So we increased the size of the openings on the backplate, and increased the thickness of the stem that holds the pressure point in place. 


 
 
We then stress-tested the pressure points by literally pulling/forcing them out of the backplate several times from different angles, to make sure the pressure points wouldn't break during set-up and long-term use. The pressure points passed the stress test. 
 

 
 
We've grown and have learned so much during this process, and we've enjoyed every bit of it! 
We are offering The Natural Spine in 6 different colors: 
Arctic White

 
Charcoal 

 
Indigo

 
Forest

 
Sweet Red

We are now ready to manufacture, and we need YOUR HELP :)

<p>UPDATE: I am making an effort to create a shorter timeline for the herbal compresses to be delivered to you, due to the health support needs during the Covid19 pandemic. We should have products ready for you closer to August, so you can start using them to boost your health or treat yourself to help recover from illness before the tougher fall and winter time. </p>
<p>Remember, these herbal compresses can be used for helping soothe your body to relieve mental and physical relaxation, muscle soreness and fatigue, digestive discomfort, and respiratory tension. Ginger aromatherapy (not just internal use) <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3604064/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">has been shown to help relax smooth muscles including those of the respiratory system. </a></p>
<p>These are also safe for children to use, and we are adding a special compress just for kids! Perfect for bonding around a gentle and fun activity that also promotes health. </p>

<p><strong>The steamed herbal compress is a 3-in-1 tool:</strong></p>
<p>1) pressure point massage</p>
<p>2) deep heat that persists</p>
<p>3) anti-inflammatory pain relief</p>
<p>This tool is simply soaked in water for 5 minutes, steamed on the stove or in the microwave, and applied directly to tense muscles or aching joints. <strong>Many find it more effective than a foam roller, with heat that goes deeper and lasts longer than the dry heat pillows.</strong> We also avoid heavy scents and concentrated essential oils which can cause sensitivity, making our products gentler on the skin.</p>

<p><strong>Thai Herbal Topicals is a female-owned and operated startup. </strong>Above are pictured the full team: Buz, Beth, and Ploy. This company has grown from our clinical experience and training: Buz and Ploy both have Masters degrees in Thai Traditional Medicine and I have a Masters degree in Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine.</p>
<p>We have worked together for the past 2 years to bring you our first series of herbal products. We already have several ideas to take these traditional tools to the next level. <strong>We just need YOUR help to get there! </strong>We need to complete the upgrade of our herbal processing facility and achieve Thai FDA certification for our products. <strong>This will only take 3-4 months from the time we achieve funding.</strong> This is an efficient team, and our pleasure is to provide YOU with your healing tools as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Our products will be certified at a higher level of quality control than most of the herbal topicals on the US market, because <strong>the Thai FDA must approve the processing facility and the individual products. </strong></p>
<p>These herbal tools are used by people from all walks of life: Thai kickboxers, postpartum mothers, office workers, and Thai grandmothers who teach their grandchildren to soothe their arthritis by treating their backs with herbal compresses. <strong>This medicine is meant to be shared and given to loved ones - family and friends - as well as patients in a clinical setting. </strong>Many of the best hospitals in Thailand use this treatment in their Traditional Thai Medicine department. But at its core, Thai herbal medicine is all about the art of resilience in daily life.</p>
<p>The Thai steamed herbal compress- ""Luk Pra Kob"" in Thai- is a fantastic healing massage tool that is not commonly available in the US. We are here to change that, in a way that honors and uplifts the source- Thai herbalists.</p>

<p>Some of our core features: </p>
<p><strong>FRESH THAI HERBS</strong></p>
<p>Grown in the heartland of Traditional Herbal Medicine in Ayutthaya, Thailand, our herbs are tended by hand, and assured of the highest quality. This makes our products more potent.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSPARENCY: FARM TO FOOT RUB</strong></p>
<p>You will see our entire production process as we grow into our Thai FDA and GMP certified herbal product facility, with your help. </p>
<p><strong>SABAI: THE ART OF FEELING GOOD</strong></p>
<p>“Sabai sabai” is a classic Thai phrase meaning relaxed, pleasantly without a care, or happy.</p>
<p>This happy state comes from not ignoring pain in life, but overcoming pain and consciously creating joy.</p>
<p>This is the art of resilience.</p>
<h3>Herbal Infusion Oils: Powerhouse companions to the Steamed Herbal Compress</h3>
<p>The steamed herbal compresses will activate and increase the impact of soothing topicals applied to the skin prior to using the herbal compress. Feel free to use them with your favorite liniments, oils, and balms. We offer a set of classic Thai herbal infusions that have been extracted using water, oil, and alcohol, fermented, and clarified. These oils are meant to be used as a set at home, covering a wide range of types of pain (since not all pain is due to the same cause!). </p>
<p>In Thailand, many balms and oils are color-coded with strong coloring agents that indicate whether the balm is warming (RED= spicy, increases circulation), medium/neutral (YELLOW= soothing to muscles and digestion), cooling/cold (GREEN= feels cold, decreases circulation and distracts from pain). We don't use any coloring agents or chemicals, and we avoid strong essential oils. Each oil is 55% pure herbal infusion- most pain relief products rely on essential oils, which are not as complete in impact as the whole herb infusion. To indicate their different effects, we have labeled them Activating, Balancing, and Cold.</p>
<p>-The activating oil is warming and great for old injuries, chronic pain, joints and tight muscles.</p>
<p>-The balancing oil is warming or cooling depending on the person (weird, I know!), has a light clove scent, is safe for kids over 3 years old, and is great for muscles and belly rubs.</p>
<p>-The cold oil is very cooling, so don't use it over large areas of the body or you will get a chill! It helps with the hot, red inflammation of acute injuries and insect bites. </p>

<h3>Testimonials: </h3>
<p>For the compresses, from patients and providers:</p>
<p>""I really love the steamed herbal compress Beth uses, especially to break up knots of stress in the neck and shoulders. <strong>The penetrating warmth and herbal fragrance of the compress makes for a uniquely refreshing experience.</strong>” </p>
<p>""When I smell the compress it makes my whole body go ""ahhh"" and relax immediately, because the treatment is so soothing and my body remembers that."" </p>
<p>""<strong>I did the compress on myself and the kids all evening! </strong>Loved it, can not wait to do more."" </p>
<p>For the herbal infusion oils: </p>
<p>""These are milder and more effective than any topical liniment or oil I have ever tried. They are subtle, but powerful. <strong>The Activating Oil is strong without relying on menthol </strong>like most products out there. The Balance Oil has an immediate emotional neutralizing effect, <strong>I have never felt anything like it</strong>."" -Jason Kryzak, MT for 19 years, Gendai Reiki Gokuikaiden Master Level Teacher</p>
<p>""I lived and worked in Thailand for a number of years, and <strong>the smell and feel of these oils immediately take me back to Thailand.</strong> They are so powerful and potent, I have to be careful not to pour out as much from the bottle as I would other topicals. The bottles themselves are pleasingly easy to use. They pour the oil without clogging, but also don't over-pour. Very user-friendly in a busy clinic setting. The three blends cover all of the bases for needs in clinic, but the Balance blend was the surprise favorite. <strong>So gentle and harmonizing, but also powerful.</strong> I find it to be applicable to most all of my patients, <strong>great for abdominal massage, and a nice grounding finish to treatment when applied to calves and feet.</strong>"" -Miranda Black, MAcOM, LAc, co-owner of Radiant Family LLC</p>

They often took Buz around and gave her a hands-on experience with local plants. Using their knowledge, Buz’s grandparents taught her to collect and make use of these plants by turning them into cooking ingredients, spices, and herbal remedies.</p>
<p>One of Buz’s vivid childhood memories was when she helped her grandparents make herbal raw pill medicines. Buz took the ground herbs, mixed them with honey, then sculpted them into marble-sized balls. These little balls were sun-dried in threshing baskets and were later stored in dry containers for future use. Depending on the type of herbs, the herbal pills were taken orally to cure various symptoms.</p>
<p>Combining her childhood lifestyle with curiosity in the field of traditional medicine, Buz grew fond of nature. Her interest in its nuances and usefulness eventually led her to continue her higher education in Thai Traditional Medicine at Thammasat University, Thailand.</p>

<p>Ploychompoo Sirimungkalachai</p>
<p>As a young adult who is fascinated by the Health Science industry, Ploy (Ploychompoo Sirimungkalachai) was introduced to the Thai traditional medical professions by her upper classmate. She then became interested and decided to pursue her higher education in this field. During her study, Ploy learned that Thai medicine can treat various symptoms and illnesses mainly through naturally sourced herbs, which requires no complex equipment. One only needs two hands and the herbs to complete the process. Through such discoveries and practices, Ploy eventually developed a deep appreciation of the knowledge, value, and practicality of Thai medicine.</p>

<p>I'm Beth Russell, LAc, the US-based founder of Thai Herbal Topicals, and a student of nature since I was a toddler. I formally studied nature and culture at Reed College (BA Anthropology 2005), followed by a Master's in Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine with an emphasis on herbal medicine. After treating pain holistically for over a decade now, I have found that the most efficient natural pain relief tool is something that most US Americans have never experienced. Now I am happy to share with you this healing, sensory delight of a pain-relief tool that the whole family will enjoy together.</p>
<p>Over the past 15 years I have visited Thailand regularly with my husband to visit his extended family in Bangkok, where I was first exposed to the beauty and complexity of Thai culture and herbal medicine. Beginning in 2012, I learned from experts in Chinese and Thai Traditional Medicine in Bangkok in hospital settings, research institutions, and private clinics. For nearly a decade it has been my dream to share an organic, high-quality, delicious-smelling set of topical Thai herbal products with the world beyond Thailand. </p>

<h3><strong>YOUR SUPPORT WILL MAKE POSSIBLE THE FULL PRODUCTION CAPACITY OF OUR FACILITY IN AYUTTHAYA, THAILAND.</strong></h3>
<p>The problem with many Thai herbal products is the use of chemicals and adulterants, and my goal has always been to create a personal relationship with the herbalists and manufacturers FIRST, so the quality control will be assured from the beginning. I know and trust my partners in Thailand, and we all have the goal of supporting organic herbal practices in an ecologically sound way. Our products are as local and pure as you can get.</p>
<p>Our products have NO fillers, NO unnatural preservatives, NO hidden ingredients. Only ethical, sustainably sourced herbs that are supporting fair wages and organic agriculture in Thailand.</p>
<p>Your funding will allow the current herbal clinic to be converted into a production facility, complete with Thai and US FDA approval and Good Manufacturing Practices certification. The funding needed for this complete renovation is only $8,000. The rest of the funds will go toward campaign fees and order fulfillment.</p>
<p>The reason we are keeping production in Thailand, rather than importing the herbs and making the products here, is that the herbs must be super fresh to create the most clinically effective formulation. Thailand is a tropical country, full of herbs that don't grow naturally in the US. So we need to honor the medicine and the source by creating the products in their place of origin.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1580141566/jaiw2iww873oce6xhlzc.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

<p><strong>OUR GOAL IS THE INTRODUCTION OF A NEW (TO US) FORM OF SELF-CARE TREATMENT, GUIDED BY SIMPLE YET ACCURATE PRINCIPLES OF TRADITIONAL MEDICINE.</strong></p>
<p>The  broad introduction of this tool will have an impact on the physical medicine health care system in the US. By introducing an efficient, natural and sustainable treatment modality to acupuncturists, massage therapists, chiropractors, physical therapists, and other physical medicine providers, we care for bodies more efficiently while supporting health care autonomy (putting the power in the patients' hands, literally). There is currently no trusted source for medically effective steamed herbal compresses for health care providers to purchase in the US. This will fill that need, while also giving providers something that patients can take home with them to use on themselves and their family members.</p>
<p>The impact in Thailand will be the support of female entrepreneurs, the support of local sustainable herbal industry in Ayutthaya, Thailand, and the promotion of organic agriculture. The herbs used in our products are grown on the home farm and at the organic herbal medicine farms used by Chaophraya Abhaibhubejhr Hospital, a nearby Thai Traditional Medicine inpatient and research hospital. </p>
<p>The hospital supports organic herbal agriculture and traditional herbal medicine education and research, and we will be directly contributing to it by purchasing herbs. We plan to make a closer connection eventually, bringing an exchange of herbal education via our platform.</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>As a team, as a business, and as health professionals, we are dedicated to improving the quality of life for everyone as we age. Right now we are in a new golden age of herbal medicine, with access to physical resources and knowledge from around the globe. However, many herbal product companies have a scattered focus, using herbs from many different bioregions that have not been combined together traditionally, which may be causing redundancies or reduced effectiveness. Many companies rely too heavily on concentrated essential oils that are now used too commonly in this high concentration, leading to sensitivities to those products. Our herbal products rely on herbal infusions mixed with small amounts of essential oils, creating a much gentler yet highly active product.</p>
<p>By staying true to the principles of herbal combination in Thai and Chinese herbal medicine, we are using local Thai and Chinese resources to the best of their ability to treat a worldwide population in massive chronic pain.</p>
<p>We are also developing video and audio resources that will be free with the purchase of our products, such as tutorials about how to treat frozen shoulder or plantar fascitis with the herbal compress as a tool. Our goal is to help people live better lives, even avoiding surgeries in some cases, and create stronger physical caring connections to each other in a safe way.</p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Challenges we face along the way revolve primarily around construction and herbal sourcing.</p>
<p>Construction: The factory upgrades will all be purely internal, since no structural upgrades need to happen. This will all be indoors, so the rainy season in Thailand should not pose a problem. However, occasionally there are instances of major flood events that could derail even an indoor project. The timing of this project should allow for completion of construction before the flood season becomes a possibility.</p>
<p>Herb sourcing: We have a trusted herb source in the local organic herb farms of Ayutthaya, and we will also be working with Chaophraya Abhaibhubejhr Hospital, a nearby Thai Traditional Medicine inpatient and research hospital that has their own organic medicinal herb farm and processing facility. Between these sources we should have enough backups for herb shortages. Our primary herbal ingredients are all abundant and easily grown.</p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you can't contribute monetarily, sharing the campaign and helping it reach more people will help us greatly!</p>
<p>Please share on your social media platform of choice. THANK YOU!</p>
</div></div>","UPDATE: I am making an effort to create a shorter timeline for the herbal compresses to be delivered to you, due to the health support needs during the Covid19 pandemic. We should have products ready for you closer to August, so you can start using them to boost your health or treat yourself to help recover from illness before the tougher fall and winter time. 
Remember, these herbal compresses can be used for helping soothe your body to relieve mental and physical relaxation, muscle soreness and fatigue, digestive discomfort, and respiratory tension. Ginger aromatherapy (not just internal use) has been shown to help relax smooth muscles including those of the respiratory system. 
These are also safe for children to use, and we are adding a special compress just for kids! Perfect for bonding around a gentle and fun activity that also promotes health. 

The steamed herbal compress is a 3-in-1 tool:
1) pressure point massage
2) deep heat that persists
3) anti-inflammatory pain relief
This tool is simply soaked in water for 5 minutes, steamed on the stove or in the microwave, and applied directly to tense muscles or aching joints. Many find it more effective than a foam roller, with heat that goes deeper and lasts longer than the dry heat pillows. We also avoid heavy scents and concentrated essential oils which can cause sensitivity, making our products gentler on the skin.


 
Thai Herbal Topicals was born of an alliance between two Thai Traditional Medicine practitioners and one Traditional Chinese Medicine practitioner. 
Together we are bringing the beauty and effectiveness of Thai Herbal Medicine to the US. 
 

Thai Herbal Topicals is a female-owned and operated startup. Above are pictured the full team: Buz, Beth, and Ploy. This company has grown from our clinical experience and training: Buz and Ploy both have Masters degrees in Thai Traditional Medicine and I have a Masters degree in Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine.
We have worked together for the past 2 years to bring you our first series of herbal products. We already have several ideas to take these traditional tools to the next level. We just need YOUR help to get there! We need to complete the upgrade of our herbal processing facility and achieve Thai FDA certification for our products. This will only take 3-4 months from the time we achieve funding. This is an efficient team, and our pleasure is to provide YOU with your healing tools as soon as possible.
Our products will be certified at a higher level of quality control than most of the herbal topicals on the US market, because the Thai FDA must approve the processing facility and the individual products. 
These herbal tools are used by people from all walks of life: Thai kickboxers, postpartum mothers, office workers, and Thai grandmothers who teach their grandchildren to soothe their arthritis by treating their backs with herbal compresses. This medicine is meant to be shared and given to loved ones - family and friends - as well as patients in a clinical setting. Many of the best hospitals in Thailand use this treatment in their Traditional Thai Medicine department. But at its core, Thai herbal medicine is all about the art of resilience in daily life.
The Thai steamed herbal compress- ""Luk Pra Kob"" in Thai- is a fantastic healing massage tool that is not commonly available in the US. We are here to change that, in a way that honors and uplifts the source- Thai herbalists.

Some of our core features: 
FRESH THAI HERBS
Grown in the heartland of Traditional Herbal Medicine in Ayutthaya, Thailand, our herbs are tended by hand, and assured of the highest quality. This makes our products more potent.
TRANSPARENCY: FARM TO FOOT RUB
You will see our entire production process as we grow into our Thai FDA and GMP certified herbal product facility, with your help. 
SABAI: THE ART OF FEELING GOOD
“Sabai sabai” is a classic Thai phrase meaning relaxed, pleasantly without a care, or happy.
This happy state comes from not ignoring pain in life, but overcoming pain and consciously creating joy.
This is the art of resilience.
Herbal Infusion Oils: Powerhouse companions to the Steamed Herbal Compress
The steamed herbal compresses will activate and increase the impact of soothing topicals applied to the skin prior to using the herbal compress. Feel free to use them with your favorite liniments, oils, and balms. We offer a set of classic Thai herbal infusions that have been extracted using water, oil, and alcohol, fermented, and clarified. These oils are meant to be used as a set at home, covering a wide range of types of pain (since not all pain is due to the same cause!). 
In Thailand, many balms and oils are color-coded with strong coloring agents that indicate whether the balm is warming (RED= spicy, increases circulation), medium/neutral (YELLOW= soothing to muscles and digestion), cooling/cold (GREEN= feels cold, decreases circulation and distracts from pain). We don't use any coloring agents or chemicals, and we avoid strong essential oils. Each oil is 55% pure herbal infusion- most pain relief products rely on essential oils, which are not as complete in impact as the whole herb infusion. To indicate their different effects, we have labeled them Activating, Balancing, and Cold.
-The activating oil is warming and great for old injuries, chronic pain, joints and tight muscles.
-The balancing oil is warming or cooling depending on the person (weird, I know!), has a light clove scent, is safe for kids over 3 years old, and is great for muscles and belly rubs.
-The cold oil is very cooling, so don't use it over large areas of the body or you will get a chill! It helps with the hot, red inflammation of acute injuries and insect bites. 

Testimonials: 
For the compresses, from patients and providers:
""I really love the steamed herbal compress Beth uses, especially to break up knots of stress in the neck and shoulders. The penetrating warmth and herbal fragrance of the compress makes for a uniquely refreshing experience.” 
""When I smell the compress it makes my whole body go ""ahhh"" and relax immediately, because the treatment is so soothing and my body remembers that."" 
""I did the compress on myself and the kids all evening! Loved it, can not wait to do more."" 
For the herbal infusion oils: 
""These are milder and more effective than any topical liniment or oil I have ever tried. They are subtle, but powerful. The Activating Oil is strong without relying on menthol like most products out there. The Balance Oil has an immediate emotional neutralizing effect, I have never felt anything like it."" -Jason Kryzak, MT for 19 years, Gendai Reiki Gokuikaiden Master Level Teacher
""I lived and worked in Thailand for a number of years, and the smell and feel of these oils immediately take me back to Thailand. They are so powerful and potent, I have to be careful not to pour out as much from the bottle as I would other topicals. The bottles themselves are pleasingly easy to use. They pour the oil without clogging, but also don't over-pour. Very user-friendly in a busy clinic setting. The three blends cover all of the bases for needs in clinic, but the Balance blend was the surprise favorite. So gentle and harmonizing, but also powerful. I find it to be applicable to most all of my patients, great for abdominal massage, and a nice grounding finish to treatment when applied to calves and feet."" -Miranda Black, MAcOM, LAc, co-owner of Radiant Family LLC

<p>Make Grandma Smile has been serving seniors in Chicagoland area communities for over ten years, providing high level, creative engagement, and specialized memory care programs. </p>
<p>In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, senior citizens in communities and at home have found themselves more isolated than ever.  Even we are struggling to be able to connect with them the way we used to, now that in-person visits are nearly impossible.</p>
<p>In an effort to preserve and even continue to grow that connection, we are working to redesign our entire engagement and training curriculums, making them available to seniors living in communities and at home, from a distance.</p>
<p>Seniors, particularly those suffering from Alzheimer's or dementia, are one of our most vulnerable populations. Make Grandma Smile has made it our mission to create better quality of life for this generation, who is so often overlooked, and who needs ALL of our support, now more than ever. </p>
<p>This fundraiser will allow us to develop a new product line of virtual tools that will help both community and family caregivers to better engage the people in their care.</p>
<p>Our goal is to raise $100,000, which will be invested in video production equipment, software program development, and tech hardware integration that will allow us to create the following prototypes:</p>
<p>The S.I.N.G System - The Spotlite Interactive Neuroplasticity Gaming System is a multi-part system that offers live-streaming engagement classes, as well as an on-demand video library. The S.I.N.G system will be available, pre-loaded, along with additional engagement games and tools, on 86"" smart touch-screen monitors, for communities serving large groups of seniors, as well as on portable tablets for 1-on-1 engagement. </p>
<p>The RemPod - A specialized, small-group engagement program that lends itself to shorter attention spans, historically led by Make Grandma Smile team members, will now be able to be led by caregivers. Our virtual training and support program teaches Make Grandma Smile methodology and behavioral approaches that help caregivers to integrate reminiscence therapy, physical activity, and creative stimulation in order to maximize senior engagement during a structured, 90 minute program. </p>
<p>Interactive Calendar - A wall-mounted monitor that houses schedules and itineraries for the day, month, and year. Activity details are available at the touch of the screen, and caregivers and family members are able to plan engagements in advance, and pick up needed supplies. Professional care agencies and communities will also be able to track attendance and activity completion for quality assurance, and to identify participation trends.</p>
<p>Our goal is to have these products ready and available to begin piloting within 90 days of the completion of our campaign. If we do NOT meet our fundraising goal, our company goals will remain the same, but with an adjusted timeline for each product's pilot launch.</p>
<p>NO part of the fundraiser is being used for personal financial gain. Everything that is contributed has been pre-allocated to helping us build these products quickly, so that we can begin reaching more seniors, sooner rather than later. </p>
</div><div>
<p>Many of us have a parent or grandparent who is struggling with isolation, loneliness, or boredom - either in a community or at home. 5.5 million Americans are currently suffering from Alzheimer's disease, and countless others are suffering from some other type of dementia. In all likelihood, you or someone you know has felt the effects of aging, and the reality is, we're all headed for some version of the same. Help us create a better world for the seniors we love, now, and for ourselves, for the future. </p>
<p>We are a small company, with goals to integrate a fairly heavy amount of technology in a short period of time. We are not blind to the challenges that this could present. That said, it is our drive and dedication to the service of seniors that has seen us through challenges in the past, and that assures us of the success to come. We are not strangers to long hours and creative problem solving, and we look forward to all the things we will build, with the help of your donations!</p>
<p>Please check out our campaign donor perks, if you haven't already. As much as we appreciate your donations, we also want to give something back to you, and to the seniors we serve.</p>

<p>If you've discovered that squat racks and benches have been hard to come by since the pandemic started, it's most likely because the supply chain from foreign suppliers like China has broken down. We are rebuilding that supply chain and sourcing all of our raw materials domestically. With that being said, we are pleased to offer our squat racks and benches created and assembled entirely in the USA at a very competitive price. With quality that meets or exceeds our competitors' standards, we are offering American made products at prices that are well below the market average.</p>

DropSet Weights is looking to reach a goal of $50,000. This amount of money will help us get from low volume manufacturer to being able to produce thousands of pounds in product per day. It will give us the freedom to produce all of our products in-house (from metal to rubber) without the need to source from other manufacturers.


 

 

 
We are pleased to offer all of our newly releasing gear as perks for this crowdfunding campaign. We are so committed to this campaign that we are offering all of our products at the lowest prices ever. 
If you've discovered that squat racks and benches have been hard to come by since the pandemic started, it's most likely because the supply chain from foreign suppliers like China has broken down. We are rebuilding that supply chain and sourcing all of our raw materials domestically. With that being said, we are pleased to offer our squat racks and benches created and assembled entirely in the USA at a very competitive price. With quality that meets or exceeds our competitors' standards, we are offering American made products at prices that are well below the market average.

Act now and save big! During this fundraising campaign, when you purchase the home gym perk that includes our adjustable bench and squat rack, you will be able to add on DropLock 3.0 Olympic plates for only $2 per pound! This deal will not last!

<p> </p>
<div style=""text-align:left;"">
<h5>Are your products natural?</h5>
<p>Yes! All our products are made with 100% natural, whole ingredients found in nature. And, with the exception of (organic) beeswax, all ingredients are plant-based.</p>
<h5>Are your products organic?</h5>
<p>We make our products using certified organic and wild crafted ingredients, and we use conventional ingredients only when necessary. While our products can be considered organic, they are not certified.</p>
<h5>Which of your products are suitable for sensitive skin?</h5>
<p>All of them! Every product is formulated with every skin types in mind — sensitive, dry, acne-prone, or mature. However, you should pay attention to the ingredients list especially if you have any allergies.</p>
<h5>Is your oil-based product ideal to use for oily skin that is also prone to acne?</h5>
<p>Yes and YES! Our products, particularly our face serum and beard oil, are ideally suited for people with oily skin. They are designed to absorb into your skin quickly and balance an oily complexion or uneven skin texture by providing nutrients to the skin (and hair) without leaving it looking greasy or feeling oily. Our skin naturally produces oil — sebum — to protect, moisturize and balance. By treating oily skin with oil, your skin will be rebalanced, healthy, and beautiful.</p>
<h5>What is the shelf life of your products?</h5>
<p>Unopened, our products will last two years or more. The expiration date on our products indicates the date by which you should use the product once opened.</p>
<h5>Can I still use your product past the expiration date?</h5>
<p>Our products are made entirely with natural ingredients, so product potency may diminish with time. Given this, our products are most effective within the expiration date.</p>
<h5>What are the risks or challenges to supporting this campaign?</h5>
<p>None. Our workspace is a private laboratory, not available for public use. We've fine-tuned our processes for efficient workflow, which means we're able to manufacture every batch of product with relative ease. Lastly, we have on hand all the raw materials and ingredients needed to meet fulfill demand for our Indiegogo supporters, and then some.</p>
<p>In the unlikely event we encounter any unforeseen delays related to packaging production, we will let you know and keep you updated on your perk fulfillment every step of the way!</p>
<h5>Where can I buy your products once the Indiegogo campaign ends?</h5>
<p>EMFYSIS products will be available via <span style=""color:#eb1478;font-weight: 600;""><b>INDIEGOGO</b> <span style=""color:#eb1478;font-weight: 500;""><b>InDemand</b></span></span> after our campaign ends. We'll be working on building our website so that you can buy products from our online store.</p>
<p>Please email us if there are specific retailers where you'd like to see our products. </p>
<p>Retailers, if you are interested in selling our products, please reach out to us regarding wholesale orders. We’ll respond to your inquiry within 48 hours.</p>

   What Makes Us Special Force of Nature. EMFYSIS products are made with distinctive plant oils that are cold pressed from raw ingredients in their most natural state. Unadulterated by excessive heat, solvents, or chemical additives, virgin oils retain all their valuable nutrients — vitamins, minerals, powerful antioxidants, and rich essential fatty acids — to nourish and hydrate to give you beautiful and healthy skin.Beauty, Simplified.Simplify your daily beauty ritual with products ideal for every skin type; from dry to oily, sensitive or mature. We meticulously researched unique plant oils and selected ingredients with the highest nutrient value, healing qualities, and specific skin for all skin types.Ethical & Sustainable.We use certified organic and wildcrafted ingredients acquired from reputable suppliers that support ethical and sustainable agriculture, harvesting, and production, and are committed to environmental and social responsibility.We avoid highly processed refined plant oils regardless of any certification. Refined oils amount to chemically altered ingredients stripped of valuable nutrients and therapeutic properties, are harmful to the environment, and expose workers to health hazards during the manufacturing process.Our packaging reflects these values as well; gorgeous glass bottles from Italy are eco-friendly, reusable, and recyclable; retail packaging is made from post-consumer content; and shipping packaging is minimal using compostable material.No Animal Testing.We don’t believe in animal testing, and never will. Instead, we put ourselves to the test, giving us the opportunity to confirm with confidence how fabulously effective our products are. And they really are!Verified Safe & Effective.EMFYSIS products are in compliance with the FDA and independently tested for safety and the effectiveness of the plant-derived ingredients we use as preservatives — willow bark extract and radish root ferment.Made with Love.Behind every EMFYSIS product is love, passion, and dedication to our craft. To ensure quality is never compromised, we built a private workspace with state-of-the-art equipment. Located in San Francisco, we make our products under the highest manufacturing standards, in step with additional sustainability practices of our own.


 Fun fact:  We designed the EMFYSIS logo using the Golden Ratio, a mathematical equation that creates a unique pattern of symmetry and balance in physical form. The Golden Ratio is often found in nature, science, and art, and is recognized as an expression of beauty and perfection.


  Our Products Enjoy a daily beauty ritual with EMFYSIS, in the mornings and evenings. Amplify benefits by layering EMFYSIS products, starting with the face serum or beard oil, followed by the eye cream, then finishing with the face cream (optional for morning use).


 Eye Cream TREAT.TREAT yourself with this decadent and powerful eye cream to care for the delicate skin around your eyes. You’ll soon see the appearance of fine lines and dark circles disappear, illuminating your natural beauty.Rich in essential fatty acids, our eye cream will moisturize and restore elasticity to your skin. Specialty plant oils like cherry kernel and evening primrose give your skin a healthy dose of valuable vitamins (A, C, E, and K) and minerals to lighten, brighten, and renew the complexion around your eyes.INGREDIENTS: Purified Water, Cherry Kernel Oil, Macadamia Nut Oil, Cranberry Seed Oil, Rice Bran Oil, Grape Seed Oil, Evening Primrose Oil, Meadowfoam Seed Oil, Polyglycerol-3 Polyricinoleate, Sorbitan Isostearate, Vegetable Glycerin, Leuconostoc/Radish Root Ferment Filtrate, Elderberry Fruit Extract, Beeswax, Shea Butter.

 ILLUSTRIOUS Face Serum. This lightweight yet potent face serum will transform your complexion and give your face a polished look. Our unique blend of exquisite oils contains an unprecedented concentration of nutrients — antioxidants, phytochemicals, and enzymes — to deeply hydrate and nourish, while diminishing the appearance of fine lines, deep wrinkles, and blemishes. Your skin will look healthy, beautifully vitalized, and ILLUSTRIOUS.Pomegranate seed oil is high in antioxidant compounds proven to help prevent skin cancer, protect skin from UV damage, and minimize the effects of aging. An Omega-5 fatty acid specific to pomegranates helps repair skin, stimulates collagen production, and protects against environmental damage.Pumpkin Seed Oil (often referred to as green gold), prized as the finest and healthiest oil in the world, has been used for thousands of years to treat and heal. Pumpkin seeds are rich sources of unique enzymes, phytonutrients, vitamins, and minerals to nurture and renew your skin. The serum can be used as a foundation primer, or as an indulgence — a cuticle softener.INGREDIENTS: Pumpkin Seed Oil, Jojoba Oil, Hazelnut Oil, Pomegranate Seed Oil, Castor Seed Oil, Papaya Seed Oil, Marula Oil, Polyglycerin-3 Beeswax.Tip: Buy two; keep one at home and one in your bag. Our serum is that good. 


 TIMELESS Face Cream.Fall in love instantly after lavishing yourself with this luxurious and efficacious face cream. TIMELESS will restore the look of healthy skin and reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles. Your skin will feel hydrated and look more radiant.Red raspberry seed oil has significantly high levels of phytochemicals — carotenoids, ellagic acid, anthocyanins, and more — proven to help prevent skin cancer, protect against pre-mature aging, UV damage, and calms inflammation. Moringa oil, used since ancient times to cleanse and detoxify the skin, is rich in vitamins and antioxidant properties to nourish, moisturize, and promote an evenly-toned complexion.INGREDIENTS: Purified Water, Abyssinian Oil, Kukui Nut Oil, Grape Seed Oil, Red Raspberry Seed Oil, Jojoba Oil, Moringa Oil, Polyglycerol-3 Polyricinoleate, Sorbitan Isostearate, Vegetable Glycerin, Leuconostoc/Radish Root Ferment Filtrate, Elderberry Fruit Extract, Beeswax, Shea Butter, Sea Buckthorn Berry Oil.

I can honestly say that very few products work as well as EMFYSIS; they're some of the best I've ever used! I love everything about the eye cream — the soft, creamy texture, how it feels on my skin, and most of all, the results. The serum is like silk in a bottle; my skin looks and feels impeccable. The face cream is my all time favorite — it has totally transformed my skin!— Lauren A., Devotee
 

Initially, I didn't think the serum would work as well as it has, and now I am completely obsessed with it! It made my skin so incredibly soft, and gave it a healthy glow! Before, I had just two consistent staples in my beauty routine — my face wash and my Clairsonic; now I'm adding a third — the EMFYSIS serum. It is a MUST HAVE!— Agnes O., Actress
 

I can't rave enough about the serum and face cream! As a triathlete, I'm constantly training outdoors which takes a huge toll on my skin. On days when my skin is feeling sensitive and irritated from excessive exposure to outside elements, laying both products really nourishes and calms my skin. EMFYSIS products are AMAZING!— Rachel L., Triathlete

Frequently Asked Questions
 

Are your products natural?
Yes! All our products are made with 100% natural, whole ingredients found in nature. And, with the exception of (organic) beeswax, all ingredients are plant-based.
Are your products organic?
We make our products using certified organic and wild crafted ingredients, and we use conventional ingredients only when necessary. While our products can be considered organic, they are not certified.
Which of your products are suitable for sensitive skin?
All of them! Every product is formulated with every skin types in mind — sensitive, dry, acne-prone, or mature. However, you should pay attention to the ingredients list especially if you have any allergies.
Is your oil-based product ideal to use for oily skin that is also prone to acne?
Yes and YES! Our products, particularly our face serum and beard oil, are ideally suited for people with oily skin. They are designed to absorb into your skin quickly and balance an oily complexion or uneven skin texture by providing nutrients to the skin (and hair) without leaving it looking greasy or feeling oily. Our skin naturally produces oil — sebum — to protect, moisturize and balance. By treating oily skin with oil, your skin will be rebalanced, healthy, and beautiful.
What is the shelf life of your products?
Unopened, our products will last two years or more. The expiration date on our products indicates the date by which you should use the product once opened.
Can I still use your product past the expiration date?
Our products are made entirely with natural ingredients, so product potency may diminish with time. Given this, our products are most effective within the expiration date.
What are the risks or challenges to supporting this campaign?
None. Our workspace is a private laboratory, not available for public use. We've fine-tuned our processes for efficient workflow, which means we're able to manufacture every batch of product with relative ease. Lastly, we have on hand all the raw materials and ingredients needed to meet fulfill demand for our Indiegogo supporters, and then some.
In the unlikely event we encounter any unforeseen delays related to packaging production, we will let you know and keep you updated on your perk fulfillment every step of the way!
Where can I buy your products once the Indiegogo campaign ends?
EMFYSIS products will be available via INDIEGOGO InDemand after our campaign ends. We'll be working on building our website so that you can buy products from our online store.
Please email us if there are specific retailers where you'd like to see our products. 
Retailers, if you are interested in selling our products, please reach out to us regarding wholesale orders. We’ll respond to your inquiry within 48 hours.
Our email address is info@emfysis.com.

An average worker bee produces 1/12 of a teaspoon of honey in her lifetime and it visits more than 2,000 flowers in a good day, 50 to 100 flowers during a collection flight until its crop is filled with nectar and it can return to the hive. It takes 1,600 such flights to produce 30 gr of honey and bees must visit about 4,000,000 flowers to produce one kilo of it. Bees fly about 177,000 km to collect the nectar needed to produce one kilo of honey and they can travel a distance of up to 1.5-3 km from the hive to collect it.

Dette muliggør en opstart af de sidste faser, hvori masseproduktion af den første sending kan påbegynde, samt iOS App kan færdiggøres.Du kan være en af de første ejere af ArionSensor og medvirke til færdigudviklingen af ny og spændende optimeringsudstyr.        Har du nogensinde tænkt på hvor meget skridt, trav eller galop du laver under dine træningssessioner? Nu kan du få det!                                 Hjælp os med at bringe dette til live ved at støtte projektet, og køb din ArionSensor inden den kommer på markedet. Vi eksisterer kun for at optimere din træning!


Det er nemt at komme i gang.Bare start ArionSensor App, opret en profil, opret en hesteprofil og du er klar.App vil være tilgængelig til Android 4.1+ og iOS 7.1+ 
       
Bevægelsesgenkendelse og rotation
Få de vigtigste informationer under din træning og find ud af om du træner balanceret.
Sessionens informationer vil vises, hvilket gør det nemt og hurtigt at vurdere de mest gængse parametre ift. tidligere træninger. Antallet af overgange, antallet af spring udført og den distance, der er redet vil blive vist her. Distancen kan dog oftest kun anvendes, når der rides udenfor, da GPS signal har problemer indenfor.
 

Skridtfrekvens.
Få et hurtigt overblik over din træning, og hvor skridt, trav og galop er udført, samt med hvilken skridtfrekvens.
Når du tilter telefonen får du en større skærm til at se det komplette overblik over hvornår i træningen der er redet skridt, trav og galop.Intensitet og symmetri. Intensitetsindeks er baseret på mængden af accelerationer din hest er udsat for.Symmetri kan hjælpe dig med at detektere mulige skader, og komme dem i forkøbet før det går galt.Vores webservice giver dig det bedste overblik over dagens træning samt dine generelle træningsmønstre. Vores App er altid gratis. Både hente og bruge!Med abonnement for ArionSensor kan du se detaljeret data på internettet. Dette medfølger i din 6 måneders periode. Herefter koster det kun 49,- pr. måned.   Få indblik i dine ridesessioner fra vores webservice og bliv meget klogere på dig selv og din hest.Gå i dybden med dine træningssessioner, og se om du har trænet balanceret ift. højre og venstre rotation. Undersøg om dine træningssessioner afviger fra din planlægning.Vores webservice er den optimale logbog for dig og din hest! Bliv klogere på hvor symmetrisk din hest bevæger sig.Få indsigt i større afvigelser fra din hests normale symmetri og undgå unødvendige skader.ArionSensor vurderer hestens vertikale og horisontale kræfter, samt hvor lang tid hvert skridt varer, sammenligner højre og venstre side, og viser det med procentvis afvigelse, samt farvekode for hvornår din hest har større forskellighed mellem venstre og højre side. På vores webservice giver vi det fulde overblik over dagens træning, hvor og hvor meget skridt, trav, galop og spring der er udført. Beskrivelse af hvor mange 360 graders rotationer der laves, hvor meget arbejde der laves i dagens træning og hastigheden af dagens ridt. Du kontrollerer selv, hvem der må se din hests data ved at give dem en invitation.Tilføj eller fjern heste i din Stald (Webservice: Stable).Hjælp os med at blive klogere på din ridning: Vi er meget interesseret i dine forslag til, hvad du gerne vil kunne se omkring din hest og jeres træning. Vi spørger dig, for at kunne forbedre vores funktioner så det passer til dig.  Sådan ser en træningssession ud fra vores side.Igennem vores udvikling af ArionSensor har vi testet utallige heste for at opnå den mest stabile algoritme for genkendelse af skridt, trav, galop og spring. Som du kan se nedenunder, definerer vores algoritmer hvert eneste skridt: Grøn = Skridt, Gul = Trav, Rød = Galop og Sort = Spring  På billedet ovenfor får du et indblik i, hvordan signalerne ser ud, når vi modtager dem. Vores algoritmer detekterer gangarten, og bagefter inddeles hvert skridt i venstre eller højre bagben skridt. Som det også kan ses ovenfor beskrives det ud fra vores algoritmer blandt andet om der rides lige ud, venstre eller højre Volte.
Vores algoritmer er smarte. De opdaterer sig selv ift. din hest, hvis der findes bedre grænseværdier til gangartdetektering, hvilket betyder at du ikke skal kalibrere sensoren til din hest eller nogen hest, også selvom det er vidt forskellige heste, der er forskellige i højden.Vi er ved de sidste faser af udviklingen. Vi har blot brug for at lave de sidste detaljer og færdig udvikling af iOS app, inden vi lancerer. Vi har siden april 2015 arbejdet frem mod dette! Vi er glade og stolte over, at vi snart kan give dig alle fordele med ArionSensor.Som du kan se er vi næsten i mål. De sidste faser mangler, og derefter er vi klar til at lancere.ArionSensor er en innovativ smart sensor til monitorering af af hestens kinematic i ridesport.Tekniske detaljer - basis facts.

It is easy to get started. 
Just start ArionSensor App, Create a profile, create your horse profile and you are ready. App will be available for Android 4.1+ and IOS 7.1+
Gait detection and rotation during training session. Get info during your training session whether your training is balanced.
Stats of the training session is shown in numeric manner to make it easy to compare training sessions. Number of transitions, number of jumps performed and the distance travelled is presented here. The distance travelled is only usable when riding outside because of the lack of GPS signal indoor.
 

Stride frequency
Get a quick view of your training session, where your walk trot and canter was performed and at what step frequency.
When you tilt your phone, the can view the entire training session, to get a fast overview of what you did.
 Intensity and Symmetry. The intensity index is based on the amount of acceleration your horse is exposed to.Symmetry can help you detect  possible upcoming injury. Be more informed of your training. This makes it much easier to plan ahead! It is always great to know what you did the last month. This is the new way of making a log.  Train smarter and be more aware of you training from our webserviceGet in depth with your data, and see if you had a balanced training session.Now if you training session deviates from your training scheduleOur webservice is the optimal log for you and your horse! For those who wish to get a better understanding of your horses symmetry index, use the attachment pads that comes in the package. Attach the sensor to the lower back where the best data for this exist. Use the Symmetry Index as an indicator for possible upcoming injuries such as lameness.ArionSensor evaluates the vertical and horizontal accelerations and how long every stride was, compairing right and left. We present a color coded view to easy know if your horse has large asymmetrical behavior. A description of how many rotations you did, and in which gait i happened is presented along with the velocity of every riding session. In the webservice stable, you are in complete control of who can view your horses data.Add or delete any followers as you like.Help us present even better graphs and info to you!We are very much interested in your proposals, and what is important for you.We ask you, because we want to make the functionalities even smarter for you. 
 
This is how a training session looks like from our point of view.
Throughout our development of ArionSensor, we have tested multiple horses to reach the most stabile algorithm for gait detection of Walk, Trot, Canter and Jumping.
As shown below, our algorithm define ever stride as: Green = Walk, Yellow = Trot, Red = Canter and Black = Jumping (not present)
 
 

 
The picture above shows how the signals are looking when we receive it. Our algorithms detect the gait, and afterwards divide the gait into Left or Right hind limb stride.
As seen above, the algorithm also detects whether your horse rides Straight, Left or Right in every gait.
Our algorithms are very smart. They update themselves regarding your trained horse if it find more appropiate boundaries for gait detection, which means that you don't even have to calibrate the device for every horse!

 We are at the final stages of development. We just need to make the last production details and iOS app developement before we can launch.As you can see, we are almost there. Just the last bit, and we are ready to ship. ArionSensor is an innovative smart sensors for monitoring kinematics in horse riding sports.Here are some of the basic facts:

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>I was a full time physiotherapist and I helped people with many kinds of muscle related issues, but only eye muscle related issues have been mostly neglected and often ignored by us. On the surface, sore eyes, minor headache, but more issues such as lack of concentration, hard to remember things, compromised sleep quality, even depression, all has to do with eye fatigue.</li>
<li>I have worked with a few medical and business partners to come up with the idea of developing a device that soothes the eyes and truly provide an efficient eye therapy for all people, and solve the problems that traditional eye drops don't. Not surprisingly, all my business partners have eye issues and they are all excited to make this happen. So we have started the design on our own and consulted with other professionals and production companies, and initially we did not want anyone to know this due to copyright and patent matters, and we have all contributed money into this project, but we had to pause it because we didn't realize that the actual production cost would be so high that we simply can't afford on our own, so we need your help.</li>
<li>At the moment we have a solid idea of how much money is needed to put into productions, and any more than that we can put into marketing, so that more people will know this product and benefit from it. You can contribute to make this entire project happen and we will deliver a finished product to you before it is sold in the market.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Break it down for folks in more detail:</p>
<ul>
<li>We need minimum $300,000 for the production.  The money is for the materials, designers, factory workers, test monitoring, marketing for finding volunteers, procurement of all parts, engineers and scientists involved etc. </li>
<li>Because we really need you at this stage, and every dollar counts, but we really would like for you and people around you to benefit from this product, so we offer more than 60% off the market for a limited time, and you get it before the product is released. </li>
<li>If the goal is not reached then it depends on how much is raised and we can work out a smaller production scale so that you can still get what is promised. However, if it doesn't work out, then you get a refund after minor reductions of the actual production expenditures that are already spent.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<ul>
<li>Eyer will help you improve general wellbeing through taking care of your eyes and head. Statistics show that more than 37% headache and dizziness, fatigue is caused by the overuse of the eyes. </li>
<li>Eyer's air compression technology and micro magnetic needling technology is the first every product that incorporated the benefits of traditional acupuncture and massage. Not only does it soothe and relieve the eyes, but also reduces fine lines and wrinkles around the eyes. </li>
<li>I personally had laser eye surgery a few years ago and now they get dry and sore very often, and I've gotta massage my eyes with my hands to relieve them. But then I realized that it doens't work, because of bacteria on the hands, and not knowing how to massage, and simply being too tired to massage them. Then once I had a sore back, but physiotherapy would take too long, so I had to try acupuncture, and to my surprise, it made me heal in no time. So it made me think about connecting methods such as acupuncture to relieving sore eyes and not just sore back. So I am glad that Eyer may find its way to see the world through your help on Indiegogo. </li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The challenges are finding a good production company to really make this happen. A reputable company that has the resources to put together the parts and make it comfortable for you. </p>
<ul>
<li>At the moment we are actively checking the background and other products of the companies that we are speaking with, and we are very conservative in doing so, because we simply don't want to risk it. </li>
<li>We try out the first test products and see if that's what we wanted, and if not, we work on making improvements, and if no improvements can be achieved then we can resort to other production companies that we keep in touch with. </li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you really would like to help but you simply don't have the spare money to support, then we understand that and hope that one day when the product is out in the market it will finally reach your hands to improve your life's quality. At the mean time you can do below to help us:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ask your family and friends and see if they need Eyer, as we offer more than 60% for the fund raising.</li>
<li>Share this page on your social media so that people who need it will be able to see it. </li>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hi!  We are Amy and Ben, and we are regular folks just like you.  Over the past several years, we have made tremendous strides to eliminate our debt and work towards a more sustainable lifestyle.  It started with a couple chickens in the backyard.  Since June, we haven't purchased eggs from the store.</p>
<p>Now we want to take the next step and make soap.  All kinds of soap, but to start, we want to make body and shampoo bars.  We are hoping to make all of the raw materials needed to make soap, using techniques from only a few generations ago.</p>
<p>This is important to us because we want to learn to be self sufficient, at least to some degree, and be in a position to share our knowledge with the rest of our community.  We know we wont be able to change the world, but we can do our tiny little part.  This is one more step towards being free from our debt driven economy.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>In short, we need just a few things.</p>
<ul>
<li>In this first round of funding, we are asking for $500.  This will allow us to purchase a few pieces of necessary equipment like a distillery for making essential oils, molds, drying racks, and other soap making tools.  </li>
<li>We have some exciting perks for our early adopters.  </li>
<li>If we are unable to achieve our goal, the money we raise will go towards the project, to the extent that we can get started.</li>
</ul>
</div><div><h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3></div><div>
<p>There are some inherent risks with this project.  First of all, we have never made soap before.  While there are many recipes available, making soap may not be as simple as it seems.  There are some harsh chemicals that need to be treated with care and we will likely have to experiment a bunch of times to get it right.</p>
<p>We are qualified to handle these challenges.  First, Amy is a nurse and is comfortable measuring and mixing chemicals.  Ben is fearless and willing to try anything.  Failure is not an option for either of them.  In the end, it comes down to the fact that we are passionate about this project and are willing to try and try again until we get the right formula.</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Right now we need help getting past our material costs so that we can really get the ball rolling here. The hope is that we break even and make enough to pay for our next batch of silicone. If we get past that we'll finally start making profit, and then hopefully be able to move somewhere with more space to do this.</p>
<p>By supporting us you're directly helping the startup of a LGBT owned business, and you get to try a completely new product to the FTM sex toy market!</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>There is nothing else like this out on the FTM market yet. Similar products like strap-ons, the Buck-Off, and 4-in-1 STP packers exist, but nothing really quite like this. With a Rod Mod you'll finally be able to masturbate and penetrate with your own natal anatomy with what looks and feels like a real penis. And it feels awesome!</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>We're both first time business owners and we've both lived through some pretty rough times. So far the cost for raw materials has come directly out of our own savings, so we risk to lose a lot here. We are completely invested in this project and excited to bring something that truly feels fantastic to use. The silicone and all materials have already been purchased, and we are currently working on functional prototypes.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>How Can I Help?</h3>
<p>Don't want a Rod Mod? We offer several tiers for just regular donations and multiple one time use redeemable codes to give to your friends and family!</p>
<p>Can't afford to donate? Spread the word! Please, by all means, share this anywhere possible. The more exposure the better!</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Down the line we do intend on making multiple models with different shapes and sizes for both the interior and exterior of the product. As we gain more funding, more options beyond color will open up.</p>

<p>(image displayed is an early stage prototype for the interior and not a final product)</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Q&amp;A</h2>
<h3>Can I use this if I'm pre-T?</h3>
<p>Sadly even though down the line I plan on offering multiple sizes, it's unlikely that this will work for you if you haven't received any bottom growth from testosterone. However the same goes for all other FTM strokers on the market. Sorry!</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Can I use this during sex?</h3>
<p>That is something I'm still working on but I imagine it would involve an adjustment to the shape for a harness. For masturbatory purposes it does work pretty damn well! This is a big reason why I'm still in the prototype phase though. More updates will come soon!</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>When will this be completed?</h3>
<p>I currently have a few prototypes for the interior laying around but the design for the exterior is still being worked on. The goal is to start shipping completed products by November.</p>

The price for this kind of study is outrageously expensive costing about $700/animal.The proposed minimum budget is $55K ($40K for oncology studies using laboratory animals at contract research organizations and $15K for drug synthesis and formulations). All funds raised will be spent to support this study. Your contributions are vital to keep our momentum to bring it into life! The ImpactThe outcome of the research supported by this campaign may change the paradigm of pet cancer treatment and provide essential preliminary data to advance our approach into the Governmental agency regulated clinical trials. Pets are waiting for us to make it happen!In return for your contribution, you will be able to share an exciting experience as part of our team in bringing the innovative therapeutics into the vet clinic.And much more! If proven successful in animals, it could be applied to humans too!

<h3>BLENDi's Story </h3>
<p>Back in 2016 Freshman, Jonathan Katz had an idea after one too many clumpy protein shakes at the gym. he envisioned a portable blender that was capable of not only blending up protein shakes for after his workouts but also be able to blend up smoothies on the go wherever he went. </p>
<p>2 years and many countless hours of working on this combined with school later and the BLENDi has come to fruition and is ready to be in the customer's hands shortly. </p>
<p>Starting with a drill battery operated blender that had its cord cut off Jonathan had officially come up with the proof of concept idea and knew a portable blender could be done it was all about refining the way the product looked. </p>

<p>This prototype was nearly polished enough for it to be taken seriously. enrolling in the VVM Mentorship program he fought his way to gain a mentor (Jim Geisman) to help mentor him through the process. during one of the night he pitched, he was approached to participate and working senior mechanical Engineers at UMass to create a prototype for BLENDi. after countless hours of work done by the team of engineers, the second iteration of BLENDi was created.

<h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
<p>How is this different from the Ninja or Nutribullet? </p>
<p>- BLENDi is a truly portable blender. While Ninja or other blenders can be portable through the plastic container its blended in, the actual base that blends it is still attached to the wall and cannot work unless attached. The BLENDi allows you to completely bring everything with you which includes the blending base. </p>
<p>How is it a water bottle as well? </p>
<p>- After blending, flip it over and screw off the blending base and screw on the bottom detachable base that comes with it and carry around your blended mix without the blending attachment. </p>
<p>Can the blades spin when theirs no cannister on it? </p>
<p>- No, they cannot, there is a safety feature built in to sense when the canister is attached correctly for the blades to then spin. Don't go sticking your fingers in the canister now.</p>
<p>Can it Crush Ice? </p>
<p>- YES, it will take the full 20 second blend time. It may need a second full 20 second blend time depending on how much. </p>
<p>How Long Does Battery Last? </p>
<p>- 2 Full 20- second blends will last about a week to a week and a half if done every day. </p>

The portable rocker latches securely onto strollers, imitating the rhythmic rocking motions that babies experienced within the womb using back and forth movements.Let's give our babies the soft swinging activity they need in order to relax!As all parents quickly figure out, rocking is a great way to help our babies fall asleep - the rocking signals the cerebellum to slow down the baby's heart rate and calms down the baby. But, in doing so, we become their sleep association and soon enough our babies becomes dependent on our rocking in order to fall asleep. It’s a great bonding experience, but as most parents know, it can get very tiring. Therefore, we developed NOOMINOOMI - to aid parents by giving them an extra rocking hand that quickly connects to any stroller, anywhere.SAFETY FIRST: The NOOMINOOMI comes with safety clips that can be secured to any solid surface. We've done many safety test and you can rest assured that NOOMINOOMI is secure and safe for your baby.EASY SETUP: To set up the NOOMINOOMI, you simply need to lock the stroller’s two front tires and fasten one of the NOOMINOOMI’s secure grips to the stroller and the other to a solid surface. It takes only 2 minutes and you automatically get hours of quiet and relaxation!CUSTOM FEATURES: The stroller rocker has two speed settings to rock your baby according to their personal preference, and a built-in music app to maintain relaxation for a longer period of time.QUICK OPERATION: Simply press the power button and VOILA! You and your little one can finally relax... It's that simple.  The NOOMINOOMI was developed for parents by parents. Therefore, it has all the necessary features to help us keep up with our daily chores, while calming down our babies using the well-known technique of back and forth movements. IT’S THE BACK AND FORTH MOVEMENT!The NOOMINOOMI boasts a speaker system and 24 calming lullabies to serenade the baby to sleep. After eight minutes, the NOOMINOOMI automatically stops rocking and continues to play calming melodies. Of course, you can always resume the rocking with a simple click of a button.IT’S PORTABLE AND LIGHTWEIGHT!NOOMINOOMI is lightweight and portable. It’s made of weather-resistant materials that can withstand rain, sand and sun. The device is compatible with any stroller and can rock up to 44 lbs. NoomiNoomi’s fast charger allows it to reach a full charge in 1.5 hours.The device also boasts a USB port that can charge smartphones and tablets :)  We came up with the idea for NoomiNoomi over brunch. Shay and his wife were at our house taking turns rocking their infant in the stroller to allow each other to eat. There and then, we came up with the idea to literally create a helping hand for all the parents out there. Since then, we have invested a lot of time in research, development and quality checks on our way to the final product. Now, together with your support and pre-production funding we can make this dream a reality :)  Who needs this product?

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>As surfer I know there is nothing better then paddling into a wave and feeling the surge as the water lifts you up and pushes forward, then with a snap you're up and gliding, harnessing the immense power of the ocean for pure joy. </p>
<p>I however live in London and have a young family which means the opportunities to escape the realities of life to get a surf session is a little limited. Between keeping the kids occupied, the costly flight and week’s annual leave, makes for a challenging dilemma. In an ideal world we’d all live on a Californian coast line and be able to catch the morning wave before heading off to work. </p>
<p>How incredible would it be if we could pop to the surf lagoon after work or on a quiet Thursday afternoon? What if we could make it a family affair with facilities to keep the kids entertained while we surfed or the opportunity for the kids to learn surfing safely on perfect waves without worrying about conditions being right or endless travelling? </p>
<p>All this can be true with your help, London Surf is a purpose built surf lagoon inside the M25, making it accessible in less then an hour from anywhere in London.  The lake will have  perfect waves both barrels and carving faces, that are adjustable to suit every level of surfer and you never need check the forecast to see if the surf is up. Along with our surf lagoon we have:</p>
<ul>
<li>Flow Barrel ®</li>
<li>Indoor climbing wall and Climbing Henge - Both custom built to create a climbing experience that is second to none. </li>
<li>Freediving /scuba area - A bespoke 25m deep pool developed to be the perfect training environment for all levels of diver.  </li>
<li>Golf star area</li>
<li>Cafe </li>
<li>Shop</li>
<li>Gym</li>
<li>Kids' Zone</li>
</ul>
<p> All to make sure the whole family is catered for. </p>
<p>Surfing is an iconic sport which is growing globally and offers so much to those who love it. Not only do you get incredibly fit by surfing  but you connect with the oceans and  get to travel the world accessing many cultures. Those who surf tend to have a passion for the environment and understand how humans impact the world's oceans. I want to bring these values and the joy of surfing to everyone who's keen.</p>
<p>Imagine the impact on a child who has never seen the ocean, getting a chance to learn to surf with their inner city school. Consider how lives can be changed with the simple introduction of a new sport like surfing to those who never get that opportunity. </p>
<p>Finally think how much fun it will be to have a Surf Lagoon on your door step</p>
<h3>What Wave Technology are we using? </h3>
<p>Wave pool technology is still very new and there have been lots of exciting developments over the last few years. The London Surf company will look to employ revolutionary wave technology to create controlled waves to support beginners to experienced surfers. </p>
<h3>Where will we be located? </h3>
<p>We are working with local authority to secure sites in South east London, around the Swanley area making the London Surf Club easily accessible with great transport links into the area.</p>

THELMA is designed to help people with chronic conditions by identifying trends and triggers that aggravate or alleviate symptoms. THELMA will:
Remind you to checkin.
Provide 1-Step Checkin capability.
Allow expanded checkins to document additional information such as stress level, changes to medications, and other potential factors that you agree to report on.
Gather information (in the background - no manual entry) that may correlate to flares (aggravated symptoms) including weather and exercise data. 
Provide reports and charts with actionable data about your individual trends and triggers.
Pool together anonymous data to determine larger trends and triggers that can be used by the healthcare industry. 
Here is an overview for our THELMA prototype:We need your feedback (and contributions) to finalize and build our Prototype of THELMA. What THELMA Needs and What You GetWe are seeking $15,000 to complete the Prototype of THELMA. The money is going to help us with:
Application Development and Hosting Costs for Prototype ($7,000).
Consulting with medical and technical experts ($3,000).
Branding THELMA ($3,000).
Out-reach and Marketing ($2,000).
Here is a sneak peek at the 1-Step Checkin functionality:THELMA is being developed as a smart phone / mobile device application.  By contributing, at the $5 level and above, during this Prototype campaign, you will: 
Be awarded 1 download (prototype and general availability application) for every $5 you contribute.
Be invited to download the prototype – targeted to be ready by August 2017.
Have the opportunity to provide feedback on THELMA during application development and beta testing.
Get early access to download the THELMA application when the application goes public – targeted by December 2017.
Be able to gift downloads (if you’ve contributed at a level to receive more THELMA downloads than you need or know who to give them to) to people who need THELMA but cannot afford to make a contribution.
During this prototype campaign, we are offering a buy 5, get 1 free special.
$5 = 1 download

We’ve got some great ideas for stretch goals that we will tell you about as the campaign progress.Why THELMA is ImportantWith chronic conditions, there is so much uncertainty and frustration. THELMA will help us identify and manage the things that aggravate our symptoms (trigger flares) and give us the tools to make better, more informed, decisions about our health.
What would be different about your day if you could do one more thing than you did yesterday?
What would it change if you could share this data (including charts and reports) with your medical team?
What would change in the medical industry if a million people with chronic conditions suddenly had the tools to document their triggers?

<h3>What's Afya Tea?</h3>
<p>Afya Tea is a dietary supplement made from fresh Moringa Oleifera leaves that are cultivated in the tropics of Cameroon. The moisten soil, fresh wind and gentle rain in the area enhance the richness of the Moringa leaves that become Afya Tea. Afya Tea is processed at low temperatures to preserve all of its nutrients.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1480452530/amowhvscx3id7u2ssdsq.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Moringa Oleifera known as <a href=""http://moringadelight.com/moringa-science/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">the miraculous tree</a>, is a plant native to Africa and Asia. It is known for its proliferous amounts of nutrients in a single plant. It has been successfully used to help treat over 30 diseases such as <a href=""http://miracletrees.org/moringa-doc/study_of_di..."" rel=""noopener nofollow"">diabetes</a>, anaemia, hypertension, constipation amongst others.</p>
<p>It has the highest antioxidant score of 157,000 μmol TE per 100 g amongst all other types of tea. While the Moringa Oleifera plant is readily available in Africa, our goal is to make it also readily available to the rest of the world.</p>
<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>My name is Vanessa Zommi and I am the 21 year old CEO and Founder of Afya Tea. In order to honor my grandfather's lost battle to diabetes and actively help my mother in hers, I researched affordable and simple ways to live healthier lives. Afya Tea was born from  my desire decided to harness the power of the moringa leaves. I have witnessed the healthy impact it has on the lives of those near to my heart. This crowdfunding campaign is the catalyst Afya Tea needs to increase the magnitude and ripples of growth for everyone who aspires to lead healthier lives, as well as the farmers in the developing nation of Cameroon who strive to make ends meet. </p>

<p><span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'>We are dedicated to inspiring people to learn about and care for their eyes by putting affordable, accurate vision tests directly into their hands. Based on revolutionary patented technology, EyeQue is bringing self-administered eye tests to billions of people around the world, many of whom may not have had the opportunity to test their eyes and correct their vision without access to this low cost, convenient solution.</span></p>
<h2><strong>**Important notes on our campaign:**</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Each Personal Vision Tracker comes with a complimentary one-year subscription for one account</strong>, and $4.99 per year thereafter. If you'd like to share your Personal Vision Tracker with others, each additional account is $4.99 per year.  Each EyeQue subscription enables access to ALL EyeQue vision testing solutions.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1518483682/t1ky6nym6axxahmnvkqm.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p><strong>Why subscription?</strong></p>
<p>As EyeQue acquires more users, more on-going updates and tests to insuring secure storage of and reliable fast access to vision data becomes a priority. Your subscription helps us fund these security and performance measures. We are also adding new tests and services that will be available only to active subscribers in the near future.</p>
<p><strong>We are shipping, <u>right now</u>!</strong> Perks are shipped within days after we receive your order.</p>
<p>There may be additional <strong>customs duty and brokerage charges</strong> due on your package, if you are outside of the US. These charges are imposed by your government for importing goods into your country. EyeQue do not benefit from these charges-- In fact, we try our very best to limit them as much as possible (within legal boundaries) so you can receive your EyeQue Personal Vision Tracker quick and easy.</p>
<p>The customs duty and brokerage charges differ by country. For <strong>UK and Germany</strong>, you are expected to pay about $20 to receive your package. Customs duty is a mere $4-$5, but the administrative fee for brokerage is ~$12. For <strong>Canada</strong>, we are changing our shipping service from DHL to USPS to avoid additional charges; because of NAFTA, for packages with values less than $100, you will only need to pay a very small percentage for imports based on your location; there's also a good chance that you won't need to. For <strong>Spain, Israel and Italy</strong>, the total can go up to about $40; The custom duty is very high for the ""medical device"" category, as we are registered with the FDA. While we would love for you to purchase from our campaign and try out our awesome product, we want to give you a heads up so you are aware of the additional charges before backing our campaign. <strong>We cannot thank you enough for your support!</strong></p></figure></div>

<p><strong>Does this work for everyone? </strong>The Personal Vision Tracker works for most people. Some users have trouble using it due to accommodation (eyes' focusing abilities) which is common amongst young adults (under 25 years of age). This product works better for those over 30 years of age.</p>
<p><b>How accurate are the results? </b>The PVT (Personal Vision Tracker) is a self-administered test and results will depend on how well the test was taken by the user-- make sure you watch the <a href=""http://www.eyeque.com/support"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">tutorial video</a>! For certain people with various health conditions the device will not give accurate results.

<p><strong>Will the myEyeQue App work in my country?</strong> The myEyeQue app has been rigorously tested in three supported countries: the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom.

<p><strong>Can I use it for contact lenses? </strong>You can use the EyeQue Personal Vision Tracker to check the effectiveness of your contact lenses by taking an EyeQue vision test while wearing them. The results from the Personal Vision Tracker should not be used to purchase contact lenses.</p>
<p><strong>My shipment to UK did not have customs duty prepaid?</strong> We were offered erroneous information when we quoted our Indiegogo backers that we can prepay customs duty to the UK.

Based on revolutionary patented technology, EyeQue is bringing self-administered eye tests to billions of people around the world, many of whom may not have had the opportunity to test their eyes and correct their vision without access to this low cost, convenient solution.
**Important notes on our campaign:**
Each Personal Vision Tracker comes with a complimentary one-year subscription for one account, and $4.99 per year thereafter. If you'd like to share your Personal Vision Tracker with others, each additional account is $4.99 per year.  Each EyeQue subscription enables access to ALL EyeQue vision testing solutions.

Why subscription?
As EyeQue acquires more users, more on-going updates and tests to insuring secure storage of and reliable fast access to vision data becomes a priority. Your subscription helps us fund these security and performance measures. We are also adding new tests and services that will be available only to active subscribers in the near future.
We are shipping, right now! Perks are shipped within days after we receive your order.
There may be additional customs duty and brokerage charges due on your package, if you are outside of the US. These charges are imposed by your government for importing goods into your country. EyeQue do not benefit from these charges-- In fact, we try our very best to limit them as much as possible (within legal boundaries) so you can receive your EyeQue Personal Vision Tracker quick and easy.
The customs duty and brokerage charges differ by country. For UK and Germany, you are expected to pay about $20 to receive your package. Customs duty is a mere $4-$5, but the administrative fee for brokerage is ~$12. For Canada, we are changing our shipping service from DHL to USPS to avoid additional charges; because of NAFTA, for packages with values less than $100, you will only need to pay a very small percentage for imports based on your location; there's also a good chance that you won't need to. For Spain, Israel and Italy, the total can go up to about $40; The custom duty is very high for the ""medical device"" category, as we are registered with the FDA. While we would love for you to purchase from our campaign and try out our awesome product, we want to give you a heads up so you are aware of the additional charges before backing our campaign. We cannot thank you enough for your support!

My shipment to UK did not have customs duty prepaid? We were offered erroneous information when we quoted our Indiegogo backers that we can prepay customs duty to the UK. Unfortunately that is not something we can do, and we apologize. But we do intend on keeping our words-- Please kindly email us your receipt, and we will refund your customs duty charges (this is for orders up to April 25, 2017).

<p><strong><span>Q.</span> <span>Is it possible to exercise during pregnancy and menstruation?</span></strong></p>
<p>A. In general, you should not experience any issues when wearing Cellings during your menstrual cycle. However, please note that it may feel tight around the abdomen muscles which may be uncomfortable especially during workouts for sensitive individuals. Pregnant women could contract their uterus and strain it. We recommend going back to Cellings after 1 month for a natural delivery, and 3 months after a caesarean section. If you want to exercise, turn off the stimulation in that area and choose to apply it to other areas.</p> <p><strong><span>Q.</span> <span>How many times do I have to do it to see the effect?</span></strong></p>
<p>A. It depends on age, gender, physical condition, living environment, and fitness, but you may have the effect of working out for two to three days with single 20-minute workout with Cellings. We have discovered that individuals who wear Cellings and exercise for more than 30 times of workout notice more drastic changes to the body compared to when they do not wear Cellings when working out.</p> <p><strong><span>Q.</span> <span>Will</span> <span>the stimulation strain</span> <span>my</span> <span>body?</span></strong></p>
<p>A. EMS technology was invented for rehabilitation and treatment purposes. Our body is able to move thanks to the biomechanical signals we get from the brain. EMS biomechanical technology uses that same signal in order to deliver the stimulation deep into your muscle layer, and it is medically proven to be safe. The pain or muscle strain you could experience could be caused due to muscular development. EMS technology is widely being used in hospitals for medical purposes.</p> <p><strong><span>Q.</span> <span>Is it not dangerous?</span></strong></p>
<p>A. It uses the same level of frequency that is used in hospitals and physical therapy clinics, so there is no danger.</p> <p><strong><span>Q.</span> <span>Can you witness the effect without exercise?</span></strong></p>
<p>A. Yes, you can. However, our tests have shown that the results are best when you wear Cellings and exercise frequently throughout the week. </p> <p><strong><span>Q.</span> <span>How much use do you recommend for a day?</span></strong></p>
<p>A. We recommend no more than having the EMS on more than 3 times a day for 20-minute intervals. </p> <p><strong><span>Q.</span> <span>What strength level do you recommend?</span></strong></p>
<p>A. We recommend starting off at levels 1-5 when you are first using it. You can increase the intensity as you get used to the lower levels.</p>

Cellings is pair of leggings that assists with muscle toning thanks to the effects of Electro Muscle Stimulation (EMS) technology and special fabric. Cellings is designed to conduct frequency and waveform that is safe and capable to stimulate muscle. By shrinking and loosening muscle through direct stimulation, our EMS leggings can produce up to 4-10x better results.


 

 

 
You can choose where you want more stimulation among 4 body parts – abdominal part, hip, front / back thigh – for EMS care. EMS stimulates muscle and supports your muscle relaxation before, while, and even after exercise.


 

You can re-use it after sprinkling water, which is economical. 


 

 
A pad, which is produced with specially processed conductive fabric, and flexible code helps EMS pad be unnoticed. The pad is made using pressed and sewed thin sponge pad and conductive silver fabric and flexible conductive code, which makes it not show on the outside.
 
 


 
 

  
 

 


 

 

 

To work out the core muscles and hip area, place the Electrical Muscle Stimulation pads on your right side.
To work out the hamstrings and glutes, place the Electrical Muscle Stimulation pads on your left side. 
We've also made the intensity levels starting from Level 1 to Level 15. Choose what works best for you!
 
 

 

 

 

 
There are 4 different modes - abdominal part – hip mode, front – back thigh mode, overall stimulus mode, and interval mode – that can be activated to stimulate specific muscle groups.


 

 

  Low frequency gets conducted even better if you add a spray or two of water to the special fabric inside Cellings. 

 

 

 

 
The EMS pads are made using pressed and sewed thin sponge-like materials and conductive silver fabric as well as flexible conductive code, which prevents the underlying material from protruding the surface. 
 

  Exterior
NILON + SPANDEX high-density double-sided fabric provides smooth touch, excellent durability, fast sweat absorption, and quick-drying effects like cotton.
 
Inner
The inner fabric is flexible due to the (INNER) SHELRON + SPANNEDX high-density double-sided fabric and uses additional soft lightweight premium breathable fabric to absorb and dry sweat quickly. 
 
A special incision pattern on the exterior and interior Y-zone. 
 

 
Cellings is made of a blend of high-density double-sided SPANDEX, of which the thread is treated with a coating to have high specific heat capacity and help expel excess body heat during intense work out sessions. 
 
 

 
 

 




 
  
 
  
  
 

  
 

 
 

 
Q. Is it possible to exercise during pregnancy and menstruation?
A. In general, you should not experience any issues when wearing Cellings during your menstrual cycle. However, please note that it may feel tight around the abdomen muscles which may be uncomfortable especially during workouts for sensitive individuals. Pregnant women could contract their uterus and strain it. We recommend going back to Cellings after 1 month for a natural delivery, and 3 months after a caesarean section. If you want to exercise, turn off the stimulation in that area and choose to apply it to other areas. Q. How many times do I have to do it to see the effect?
A. It depends on age, gender, physical condition, living environment, and fitness, but you may have the effect of working out for two to three days with single 20-minute workout with Cellings. We have discovered that individuals who wear Cellings and exercise for more than 30 times of workout notice more drastic changes to the body compared to when they do not wear Cellings when working out. Q. Will the stimulation strain my body?
A. EMS technology was invented for rehabilitation and treatment purposes. Our body is able to move thanks to the biomechanical signals we get from the brain. EMS biomechanical technology uses that same signal in order to deliver the stimulation deep into your muscle layer, and it is medically proven to be safe. The pain or muscle strain you could experience could be caused due to muscular development. EMS technology is widely being used in hospitals for medical purposes. Q. Is it not dangerous?
A. It uses the same level of frequency that is used in hospitals and physical therapy clinics, so there is no danger. Q. Can you witness the effect without exercise?
A. Yes, you can. However, our tests have shown that the results are best when you wear Cellings and exercise frequently throughout the week.  Q. How much use do you recommend for a day?
A. We recommend no more than having the EMS on more than 3 times a day for 20-minute intervals.  Q. What strength level do you recommend?
A. We recommend starting off at levels 1-5 when you are first using it. You can increase the intensity as you get used to the lower levels.
 
 

 
Tobortec is working hard to develop original new technologies by operating alongside a research institute affiliated with our company which houses all of the technical skills needed to develop hardware.
Tobortec has already produced numerous household appliances and exported its products worldwide for over 20 years. We developed a rehabilitation robot and EMS training equipment for athletes and got to introduce Cellings EMS to get closer to the public with this technology.
