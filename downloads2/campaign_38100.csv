<h3>The April Hill Park Wetland Story</h3>
<p>Tucked away in a corner of SW Portland just west of Multnomah Village, there is a special place that is home to salamanders, newts, frogs, sixty-nine species of birds, and several species of wetland plants that are uncommon in urban areas.  Many park visitors don't know this wetland exists.  The natural area doesn't have any official trails or signage. Steep, muddy slopes with blackberry thickets make the approach challenging for all but the most adventurous souls.</p>
<p>For several years, Maplewood neighbors, local students, park managers and other visitors have wanted clearer, safer access to the wetland.  However, park budgets have been cut by about 20% over the last several years.  Recently we received a significant award of funding -- and we have the opportunity to make it happen!</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<h3>The Need</h3>Right now, people entering the wetland trudge through dense vegetation and standing water.  Because there aren't any defined trails, narrow and muddy paths criss-cross through the wetland.  Some park visitors also use the area for illegal dog off-leash activity.  This has increased the spread of invasive plants, which frequently outcompete wetland natives.  It has also compacted the soil and increased sediment and bacteria in the water.  Finally, local elementary, preschool and after school program leaders have stated that they would like to be able to bring youth to the wetland, but have concerns about safe access.  <p></p>
<p></p>

<p></p>
<p>Beyond the wetland, people enjoy seeing the creek.  However, the only way across is a fallen log.  The lack of a trail has resulted in foot traffic suppressing vegetation along the creek bank and increasing bank erosion, which makes the water in Woods Creek even worse.</p>

<p></p>
<p><br/></p>
<h3>The Plan</h3>
<p>If the campaign is funded, we will be able to apply for permits in winter 2013-14 and expect to construct the project in summer 2014.  The concept, subject to final design and review, is for:</p>
<ul>
<li>2,000 feet of sustainable soft surface trail </li>
<li>About 900 feet of low-profile boardwalk with handrail</li>
<li>Two bridges across Woods Creek that will help protect the banks from erosion</li>
<li>A wetland observation platform with benches, large enough to accommodate a classroom of students</li>
<li>Signs that tell the story of the wetland, its uniqueness in the urban setting, and who lives there</li>

<h3>The Results</h3>
<p>Since 2005, Friends of April Hill Park have served as volunteer stewards of the wetland.  We've held work parties, taught local youth about this area, and helped Portland Parks &amp; Recreation improve management of the natural area.  When the final fundraising is complete, we'll be ready to implement this project that was planned in 2010.  Construction of the boardwalk, bridges and observation platform will:</p>
<ul>
<li>Provide a place for elementary school youth to get outside, and learn science from nature.</li>
<li>New soft surface trails will be more sustainable, minimize erosion and other impacts to water quality, and create a new access point from a dead-end street into the park and natural area.</li>
<li>The boardwalk will alleviate the negative impacts of social trails that currently criss-cross the wetland and degrade habitat.</li>
<li>Bridges will allow vegetation along the creek to regrow and increase the stability of the bank.</li>
<li>Signage will help underscore to park visitors why off-trail and dog off-leash activity introduces bacteria and invasive plants, which are harmful to the wetland.</li>

<p>The Lake and surrounding wildlife area is a National Park bigger than Yellowstone and strictly protected as a transition zone between Central Asian Steppe and the Siberian Taiga.  It's one of 17 ancient lakes that are more than 2 million years old, and the water is so clean you can drink it without any treatment.  There are a number of indigenous people that live around it and depend on it for their water supply.  In fact  it contains 70% of all the surface freshwater supply for the whole country of Mongolia.  There is no body of water this clean and this large in America. None.  Imagine what Lake Tahoe was like 400 years ago...thats what Lake Hovsgol is now and its 4 times as big.</p>
<h4><b>So what's threatening it?</b></h4>
<p><b>Illegal poaching, including illegal drift net fishing, illegal logging: </b>The lake has fish, including two endemic species, and since it's a lake, those fish can easily become overfished as every other fish population in the world has become.  The surrounding parklands are home to a number of really awesome animals, including ibex, argali, elk, wolf, wolverine, musk deer, brown bear, Siberian moose, and sable.</p>
<p>Mongolia has done a good job designating this area as a wildlife preserve to protect the survival of these animals, but enforcement is challenging.  <b>Rangers have been stabbed and injured trying to enforce the law against poachers</b>, who stand to make a great deal of money in the short term.</p>
<p><b>Illegal development and tourism: </b>It shouldn't be news to Americans that people in and from outside Mongolia are eager to develop properties around the lake.  <b>Rangers have caught individuals simply building around it without permits.</b> Run-off and pollution from illegal development and road building is certain to pollute the lake, as well as impact wildlife habitat.  Additionally outsiders have come in and started developing environmental tourism projects without necessarily caring for the habitat or obtaining permission.</p>
<h4>But they have rangers to enforce the laws, right?</h4>
<p>Yes, the whole park is about 4,600 square miles (1.2mm hectares) and there are 15 permanent rangers and a few seasonal ones.  Each ranger patrols over 300 square miles of park, which is about the same size as all the boroughs in New York City.  And they do it mostly on horseback.  For reference, Yellowstone is smaller and has 300 permanent Park Rangers.  <b>Imagine if there was only one policeman in a space as big as the five boroughs of New York City, and he was on horseback chasing bad guys in jeeps.</b></p>
<p>The poachers and illegal users in the park tool around in jeeps, 4x4's, and other vehicles.  Did I also mention the poachers are armed?</p>
<p>The rangers have asked for help in the form of offroad motorcycles, gear, and training.  With modern offroad motorcycles, they could patrol more effectively and discourage lawbreakers.</p>
<h4>So why do I care, and how can I help?</h4>
<p>It's true, Mongolia is halfway around the world, but I care, and here's why:</p>
<ul>
<li>We don't have that many wild places left in the world.  </li>
<li>We don't have that much wildlife left in the world.</li>
<li>I love nature, I spend a lot of time in nature, and it's not often that I get to actually do hands-on volunteering to not only help protect one of the last pristine natural places in the world, but at the same time help improve the work life of an individual who is protecting this area. That's just awesome!</li>
</ul>
<p>Even if you aren't moved by this situation, I ask that you support me in my effort to keep this wild area as pristine as possible. You can help by donating to help cover the cost of a motorcycle and equipment.</p>
<p>Where does the money go?</p>
<p>100% of the money you donate is tax-deductible, and goes to buy and ship the motorcycle and equipment. <b>I am paying my own ticket over, and the Mongol Ecology Center is not taking any of it for administration, it all goes directly to equipment for the rangers! </b></p>
<p>I am trying to fund one motorcycle and equipment.  I am trying to raise enough to outfit one ranger.  Any additional money goes to buying a second motorcycle if I exceed my fundraising goal.  </p>

<p><em>""Water is the most critical resource issue of our lifetime and our children's lifetime. The health of our waters is the principal measure of how we live on the land."" - Luna Leopold</em></p>
<p>The Los Angeles River is a crucial resource for the City that many Angelenos are completely unaware of; neglected and abused, yet still vital and beautiful. At The River Project, we have always made community education and empowerment central to any project we undertake.</p>
<p><strong>The Paddle The LA River Program</strong></p>
<p>We believe that getting people out IN the river is the most visceral and compelling way to create an educated constituency for the Los Angeles River and its watershed. This belief inspired The River Project to develop an educational boating program for the Los Angeles River so that all Angelenos would be able to experience the river <em>as</em> a river and come to appreciate it as much as we do.</p>
<p>In 2011, the Los Angeles Conservation Corps, the MRCA, Urban Semillas, and the City of Los Angeles got on board - and together, with the blessing of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, 'Paddle the LA River' was born. The 2012 Paddle program runs July 21 through September 26, with more trips scheduled and more opportunity for education.</p>
<p><strong>Our 2012 Educational Goal:</strong></p>
<p>This summer we have the chance to sponsor paddle trips for up to 200 underserved youth, including transportation and a day of Los Angeles River Watershed education both before and after the paddle. We are focusing on local at-risk and differently-abled kids:</p>
<ul>
<li>Giving kids real scientific understanding of the river, its history, and its potential as a resource for the City.</li>
<li>Empowering kids to embrace their environment and effect change, through the projects they plan and design.</li>
<li>Leading them on an exciting afternoon adventure that most Angelenos probably haven’t even imagined.</li>
</ul>
<p>Our educational curriculum meets California State Science Standards, and includes the history of the river, the science of the watershed ecosystem, and future possibilities for sustainable watershed management. In-class instruction is dynamic and hands-on.</p>
<p><strong>Why The River Project?</strong></p>
<p>Since 2001, The River Project has provided watershed education in elementary classes as an important part of each of our major projects. Kids who've come through our programs have accomplished some amazing things, like the design of the Great Toad Gate at at Valleyheart Greenway in Studio City, and the interpretive bench at Rio de Los Angeles State Park.</p>
<p>Kids who experience our hands-on curriculum learn why and how to advocate for a healthy Los Angeles watershed. They write letters, volunteer, and teach their families to make healthy changes that nurture our river.</p>
<p><strong>What your contributions will do:</strong></p>
<p>We want to take this adventure to 20 groups of kids, and the costs are considerable: transportation and equipment, in-class instruction and materials. Each $1000 we raise will sponsor one group.</p>
<p><strong>Help us raise $20,000 to grow the next generation of watershed stewards!</strong></p>

<p>My name is Anna. I am a senior at <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Cornell University</span> majoring in <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Food Science</span>. I am interested in food product development and have experience working in this feild with various big food companies in the United States. This year, I was chosen to be a part of Cornell's Student Multidisciplinary Applied Research Team<em> (SMART) </em>Learn More:  <a href=""http://ciifad.cornell.edu/engagement.cfm"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://ciifad.cornell.edu/engagement.cfm</a>, <a href=""http://ciifad.tumblr.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://ciifad.tumblr.com/</a> </p>
<p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">The COMACO team will be going to Zambia, Africa for <strong>3 weeks</strong> in January to help expand the company's <strong>IT'S WILD!</strong> food brand.</span> (See Below)</p>
<p>Our team has been in communication with COMACO representatives to begin preparation for the projects that we will be working on during our time in Zambia. Some of the products that they have asked for our help on are:</p>
<p>- Fruit Jams, Dried Mango, Breakfast Cereal, and Healthy Energy Bars</p>
<p>In addition to product development work, we will be working on food chemistry issues such as preservation and storage of the jams, uses of unripe or damaged mangoes in a microbibiologically safe way, preventing oxidation of the breakfast cereal, and packaging of the energy bars to promote extended shelf life. </p>
<p>We will also be helping COMACO in creating process development and business strategy plans for their IT'S WILD! brand. After returning from Africa, we will be writing a comprehensive study to report back to COMACO with our suggestions of how to proceed with their brand.</p>
<h3>What is the funding for?</h3>
<p>I was already chosen to be a part of the COMACO SMART team. However, as a member of the team, I need to find my own funding for the trip. The project has been partially funded by the Cornell International Institute for Food, Agriculture, and Development and by the Cornell Food Science Department. I need to raise additional funds to pay for airfare, vaccines, in-country travel, and lodging. </p>
<p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Every contribution you make will help me get closer to making this project a reality</span>. I have already begun planning great ideas to help solve the food science challenges they have requested our help with and have collected food analytical supplies to bring along that will be donated to COMACO. Now I just need to get there!</p>
<p>If you are not able to make a monetary contribution you can still help out in a much needed way - you can <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">forward this page on to all your friends</span>! Post this page to your facebook or Twitter!!</p>
<h3>What is COMACO?</h3>
<p><a href=""http://www.itswild.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.itswild.org/</a> </p>
<p>Community Markets for Conservation (COMACO), is a non-profit foundation that works along with the Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS) to <span>reduce human hunger and poverty while saving wild animals and ecosystems.</span></p>
<p>Poachers were killing thousands of animals a year, putting many of them onto the endangered species list. It was found that the poachers were hunting the animals as a source of food to feed their starving families. The agricultural products on which they based their livlihood were failing - whether because of bad weather conditions, ineffective planting techniques, or the inability to transport the products to trading areas. Environmentalist groups recognized this issue and sought to fix it. This is how COMACO came about. </p>
<p>A program has been set up where poachers can trade in their guns and snares for lessons in sustainable agriculture. They are trained in the skills and given the supplies they need to grow a variety of crops that will flourish in the conditions of the Luangwa Valley. Because a major issue had been that there was no one to sell the agricultural products to, COMACO also set up a system of buying many of these raw materials. The company then turns these materials into value added food products, which are sold throughout Africa under their personal brand IT'S WILD!.</p>
<h3>What is IT'S WILD!?</h3>

<p>IT'S WILD! is COMACO's own food brand under which they sell the value added foods made from the local farmer's agricultural products. Their main products currently include: Honey, Rice, Peanut Butter, Yummy Soy, and Ground Nuts. They recently launched their first Breakfast Cereal! <a href=""http://www.bakeryandsnacks.com/Markets/Zambian-breakfast-cereal-to-aid-health-farmers-and-conservation"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><br/></a></p>
<p>The company, with our help, is now looking to move to produce fruit jams, dried fruit products, energy bars, quick-cooking bean products, as well as more cereal varieties. </p></div>","Who am I?
My name is Anna. I am a senior at Cornell University majoring in Food Science. I am interested in food product development and have experience working in this feild with various big food companies in the United States. This year, I was chosen to be a part of Cornell's Student Multidisciplinary Applied Research Team (SMART) Learn More:  http://ciifad.cornell.edu/engagement.cfm, http://ciifad.tumblr.com/ 
The COMACO team will be going to Zambia, Africa for 3 weeks in January to help expand the company's IT'S WILD! food brand. (See Below)
Our team has been in communication with COMACO representatives to begin preparation for the projects that we will be working on during our time in Zambia. Some of the products that they have asked for our help on are:
- Fruit Jams, Dried Mango, Breakfast Cereal, and Healthy Energy Bars
In addition to product development work, we will be working on food chemistry issues such as preservation and storage of the jams, uses of unripe or damaged mangoes in a microbibiologically safe way, preventing oxidation of the breakfast cereal, and packaging of the energy bars to promote extended shelf life. 
We will also be helping COMACO in creating process development and business strategy plans for their IT'S WILD! brand. After returning from Africa, we will be writing a comprehensive study to report back to COMACO with our suggestions of how to proceed with their brand.
What is the funding for?
I was already chosen to be a part of the COMACO SMART team. However, as a member of the team, I need to find my own funding for the trip. The project has been partially funded by the Cornell International Institute for Food, Agriculture, and Development and by the Cornell Food Science Department. I need to raise additional funds to pay for airfare, vaccines, in-country travel, and lodging. 
Every contribution you make will help me get closer to making this project a reality. I have already begun planning great ideas to help solve the food science challenges they have requested our help with and have collected food analytical supplies to bring along that will be donated to COMACO. Now I just need to get there!
If you are not able to make a monetary contribution you can still help out in a much needed way - you can forward this page on to all your friends! Post this page to your facebook or Twitter!!
What is COMACO?
http://www.itswild.org/ 
Community Markets for Conservation (COMACO), is a non-profit foundation that works along with the Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS) to reduce human hunger and poverty while saving wild animals and ecosystems.
Poachers were killing thousands of animals a year, putting many of them onto the endangered species list. It was found that the poachers were hunting the animals as a source of food to feed their starving families. The agricultural products on which they based their livlihood were failing - whether because of bad weather conditions, ineffective planting techniques, or the inability to transport the products to trading areas. Environmentalist groups recognized this issue and sought to fix it. This is how COMACO came about. 
A program has been set up where poachers can trade in their guns and snares for lessons in sustainable agriculture. They are trained in the skills and given the supplies they need to grow a variety of crops that will flourish in the conditions of the Luangwa Valley. Because a major issue had been that there was no one to sell the agricultural products to, COMACO also set up a system of buying many of these raw materials. The company then turns these materials into value added food products, which are sold throughout Africa under their personal brand IT'S WILD!.

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Niue is a small Pacific Island country, but an extremely important place for some of the world’s great whales – namely, the Oceania Humpback Whale. While humpback whale populations in Australia and North America have grown steadily in recent decades, those in Niue and the Pacific Islands region are not recovering from past exploitation.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">Humpbacks are the most
charismatic of the large whales, known for their acrobatic behaviours and
haunting whale song, and many stop by Niue each year to rest, mate and nurse
their young as they make their annual migration through the tropics. The
Government of Niue declared a national whale sanctuary in 2003; however, the
impacts of pollution, fishing practices and an expanding tourism industry
continue to burden these amazing creatures here and elsewhere.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">As their numbers are not
increasing over time, the International Union for the Conservation of Nature
(IUCN) recently upgraded the Oceania Humpback Whale’s conservation status,
identifying them as a species of greater international concern.  </p>
<p><b>What We Do</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The
NWRP has been active since 2008, combining science and research with government
and community outreach to support Niue's National Whale Sanctuary. Our small volunteer team collects valuable data in the
waters surrounding Niue island, but also ensures that this data is shared with all stakeholders by consulting government on policy and management
strategies, training tourism and water-based industries and delivering
educational programs throughout the local community. </p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Since
beginning, our work has helped to develop Niue’s first whale and dolphin
catalogue – a vital first step to identifying animals and populations across
the region – and our team have been instrumental in helping to establish a
greater understanding of conservation strategies and goals in the country. The
NWRP has also empowered many Niuean volunteers and partners with research
skills and knowledge, to increase local ownership of the Project and move
toward a time when our programs may be delivered independently by the Niuean
community. </p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">It is
rare that such a depth of experience and skills comes together to protect
endangered species while also empowering local communities to do the same in
the long term. <i>Ultimately though, we believe that Niueans are best placed to
help Niuean whales, and it is only by engaging the whole community positively and
productively that they will be protected appropriately for future generations. </i></p><p style=""text-align: justify;""><i></i></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/717940/files/20140714221911-b1.jpg?1405401551"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><b style=""text-align: justify;"">Budget Breakdown</b></p>

<br/></span></div></div>","The Niue Whale Research ProjectThe
Niue Whale Research Project is a partnership between local and international
researchers who volunteer their time and expertise to help the tiny island country of Niue to protect some of the world's most endangered whales. In order to continue this vital conservation work, however, we need your help. Background 
Niue is a small Pacific Island country, but an extremely important place for some of the world’s great whales – namely, the Oceania Humpback Whale. While humpback whale populations in Australia and North America have grown steadily in recent decades, those in Niue and the Pacific Islands region are not recovering from past exploitation.Humpbacks are the most
charismatic of the large whales, known for their acrobatic behaviours and
haunting whale song, and many stop by Niue each year to rest, mate and nurse
their young as they make their annual migration through the tropics. The
Government of Niue declared a national whale sanctuary in 2003; however, the
impacts of pollution, fishing practices and an expanding tourism industry
continue to burden these amazing creatures here and elsewhere.
As their numbers are not
increasing over time, the International Union for the Conservation of Nature
(IUCN) recently upgraded the Oceania Humpback Whale’s conservation status,
identifying them as a species of greater international concern.  
What We Do
The
NWRP has been active since 2008, combining science and research with government
and community outreach to support Niue's National Whale Sanctuary. Our small volunteer team collects valuable data in the
waters surrounding Niue island, but also ensures that this data is shared with all stakeholders by consulting government on policy and management
strategies, training tourism and water-based industries and delivering
educational programs throughout the local community. 
Since
beginning, our work has helped to develop Niue’s first whale and dolphin
catalogue – a vital first step to identifying animals and populations across
the region – and our team have been instrumental in helping to establish a
greater understanding of conservation strategies and goals in the country. The
NWRP has also empowered many Niuean volunteers and partners with research
skills and knowledge, to increase local ownership of the Project and move
toward a time when our programs may be delivered independently by the Niuean
community. 
It is
rare that such a depth of experience and skills comes together to protect
endangered species while also empowering local communities to do the same in
the long term. Ultimately though, we believe that Niueans are best placed to
help Niuean whales, and it is only by engaging the whole community positively and
productively that they will be protected appropriately for future generations. Budget Breakdown
Our Project has always relied on fundraising efforts from our supporters, our team members and the community.  We have already secured funding for two team members' airfares to Niue, as well as a boat charter for the entire field season however, in order to continue our vital work, we need additional funding. None of our volunteer researchers are paid for their contributions or time. Rather, pledges will support the team to conduct a targeted research season in September 2014 and to deliver the extensive community and government engagement activities explained above. Funds are needed for:

Final airfare to Niue:       $800


Boat fuel:                           $2000


Accommodation:             $1500


Ground Transportation:  $300


Provisions:                         $1000


Indiegogo fee:                   $400

Total:                                         $6000

<p>On August 15, 2013, Ecuador announced that it was opening protected land in the beautiful Yasuni basin to oil development. Just two days later, <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/aug/16/ecuador-approves-yasuni-amazon-oil-drilling"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">trucks began to roll</a> into the rainforest, the ""lungs of the world"",  to begin drilling.<span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate"">  As I helplessly 
watched thousands of Ecuadorians demonstrate from a continent  away, I 
wondered what I could do to stop this environmental disaster. <br/></span></span></p>
<p><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate"">I'm the owner of a small online 
clothing shop on the West Coast of the US, providing pretty dresses for weddings and prom.  I don't know how to save the world.</span></span><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""> I've never even been to Ecuador.</span></span></span></span></span></span><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate"">  The enormity of making an impact seemed far out of my reach. It would take billions of dollars to reverse Ecuador's decision on oil drilling. How could I, on my own, make even the slightest ripple?  It seemed impossible.</span></span></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/29654/files/20130823085528-Ecuador_Amazon_Oil.JPEG-0da51.jpg?1377273328"" src="""" style=""width: 419.446px; height: 288px;""/></p>
<br/><p> </p>
<p>And yet, as I watched thousands of Ecuadorian citizens passionately demonstrate against the oil rigs, I felt the insistent urge to be in that square with them.  After all, I thought, they're not just fighting for their own country's well being, they are fighting to protect us all.  I couldn't understand why, after all the accolades Ecuador's no-drill plan had initially received in 2007, we weren't already doing something.  I felt powerless, frustrated.  And I wondered, am I the only one who's listening?<br/></p>
<p>But let's go back a bit. In 2007, in a landmark initiative after 30 years of severe <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yaAgLkbehfI"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">oil-industry caused pollution</a>, Ecuador offered to protect its Amazon rainforest lands from oil development, if the combined nations of the world would pay their share -  half the market value of the oil, approximately 3.6 billion US dollars.  In 2009 at the Copenhagen Climate Change Summit, the assembled nations voted to provide a Global Green Fund, which would provide 100 billion US dollars each year to developing countries to fund environmental issues.  But, by 2013, the Green Fund is still in the planning stages, and only a fraction of the money Ecuador needs to defray their costs has been raised.  In the meantime, Ecuador's foreign debt to other countries, especially China, has mounted.  To Ecuador's President, Rafael Correa, the only way forward seems to be to exploit the oil, and pay back the debt.</p>

<p><span><b>It's time we took action together to preserve this irreplaceable natural asset.</b>  Every day of drilling in Yasuni leads us closer to the day when the most diverse habitat on Earth is gone forever.  We can't wait any longer for governments to band together to solve this problem.  Individuals are the catalysts of change, and our leaders won't prioritize the environment until we demand they do.  We've been waiting for a commonsense global change to environmental policy for far too long.  If
 the world's governments won't preserve the Earth's most important CO2 
purifier, the world's citizens 
will simply have to show them how.  Let's act now to hold up our end of the bargain with 
Ecuador, and preserve the integrity of the most important 
habitat in the world.  Let's be part of real, tangible change.  Let's make the impossible possible, and be the largest crowd funded project in history to protect the most important habitat on earth.<br/></span></p>

On August 15, 2013, Ecuador announced that it was opening protected land in the beautiful Yasuni basin to oil development. Just two days later, trucks began to roll into the rainforest, the ""lungs of the world"",  to begin drilling.  As I helplessly 
watched thousands of Ecuadorians demonstrate from a continent  away, I 
wondered what I could do to stop this environmental disaster. 
I'm the owner of a small online 
clothing shop on the West Coast of the US, providing pretty dresses for weddings and prom.  I don't know how to save the world. I've never even been to Ecuador.  The enormity of making an impact seemed far out of my reach. It would take billions of dollars to reverse Ecuador's decision on oil drilling. How could I, on my own, make even the slightest ripple?  It seemed impossible.

 
And yet, as I watched thousands of Ecuadorian citizens passionately demonstrate against the oil rigs, I felt the insistent urge to be in that square with them.  After all, I thought, they're not just fighting for their own country's well being, they are fighting to protect us all.  I couldn't understand why, after all the accolades Ecuador's no-drill plan had initially received in 2007, we weren't already doing something.  I felt powerless, frustrated.  And I wondered, am I the only one who's listening?
But let's go back a bit. In 2007, in a landmark initiative after 30 years of severe oil-industry caused pollution, Ecuador offered to protect its Amazon rainforest lands from oil development, if the combined nations of the world would pay their share -  half the market value of the oil, approximately 3.6 billion US dollars.  In 2009 at the Copenhagen Climate Change Summit, the assembled nations voted to provide a Global Green Fund, which would provide 100 billion US dollars each year to developing countries to fund environmental issues.  But, by 2013, the Green Fund is still in the planning stages, and only a fraction of the money Ecuador needs to defray their costs has been raised.  In the meantime, Ecuador's foreign debt to other countries, especially China, has mounted.  To Ecuador's President, Rafael Correa, the only way forward seems to be to exploit the oil, and pay back the debt.

It's time we took action together to preserve this irreplaceable natural asset.  Every day of drilling in Yasuni leads us closer to the day when the most diverse habitat on Earth is gone forever.  We can't wait any longer for governments to band together to solve this problem.  Individuals are the catalysts of change, and our leaders won't prioritize the environment until we demand they do.  We've been waiting for a commonsense global change to environmental policy for far too long.  If
 the world's governments won't preserve the Earth's most important CO2 
purifier, the world's citizens 
will simply have to show them how.  Let's act now to hold up our end of the bargain with 
Ecuador, and preserve the integrity of the most important 
habitat in the world.  Let's be part of real, tangible change.  Let's make the impossible possible, and be the largest crowd funded project in history to protect the most important habitat on earth.

What We Need & What You Get





Ecuador
 has asked for 3.6 billion dollars, roughly half the market value of the
 oil to prohibit oil development. That's alot of money - about 52 cents for every person on the planet.  But money talks. The top 5 oil companies reported profits of $100 billion in 2012 alone.  Until there's a global tax on those profits to pay for environmental projects, we'll have to lead the way. Let's aim to raise half that money, 
that's 1.8 billion dollars, and show our governments how it's done!
I want your contribution to make a real difference. I'm partnering with World Land Trust
 , who have a 20 year history of purchasing and protecting lands in conjunction with local peoples in Ecuador, Columbia, Bolivia, and throughout the Amazon. Your donation, no matter how small or large will make a real, 
tangible difference. It's also tax deductible, (so you can give a little
 more)! 
Sir David Attenborough is their patron. Learn more about them here: http://www.worldlandtrust.orgAs a contributor to the largest crowd funding project in history, you can breathe easy, knowing you've contributed to real, tangible change in the most important environment in the world. 
You will continue to benefit from the powerful C02 exchange the Amazon rainforest provides.
And you will know you have answered the call of thousands of Ecuadorians who are protesting the pollution to their water systems, the destruction of the delicate interlinked habitats of the rainforest, and the devastating human cost in lives lost to skin disease and cancer oil drilling has caused in Yasuni in the past 30 years.
We aim to raise enough money to get governments around the world to provide matching funds to convince Ecuador to reverse its decision on oil development. 
We will work with the World Land Trust to purchase acreage in oil-rich Amazonian regions to protect biodiversity with the help of the World Land Trust. 
Donating even a small amount adds your powerful voice to our campaign.  Let governments and oil companies know that we demand change.  Now.


The Impact

The Amazon Rainforest is the largest carbon dioxide exchange in the world, taking in C02, and turning it into oxygen.  Without tropical rainforests, climate change will accelerate out of control.




The rainforest also swaps vast amounts of 
water and energy with the atmosphere and is thought to be important in 
controlling both local and regional climates, as well as ocean currents.
Indigenous peoples in Ecuador have been hard-hit by oil development in recent times.  You are helping them protect an intensive, bio-diverse habitat, with more species of plants, birds, mammals and insects per square acre than anywhere else on the planet!  
Scientists believe that less than 1% of flowering plants located there have been studied for their medicinal potential.  Some of these plants might save lives in future, if they can be preserved now.

</div><p>We are the<b> <a href=""http://www.forru.org/en/index.php?page=index"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Forest Restoration Research Unit</a></b>, a research
group within Chiang Mai University's Science Faculty (northern
Thailand). We were founded in 1994, to develop methods to restore tropical
forests to degraded sites - and we've been quite successful. We now know which
tree species to select, when to collect their seeds and the best ways to grow
them in nurseries. Our trial plots have yielded effective methods to plant and
care for trees until canopy closure is achieved and wildlife returns. Our
methods can transform denuded hillsides into rich native forest ecosystems
within about 10 years. Although the science is proven and the demand for
forest restoration has never been higher, implementing it on a scale wide
enough to significantly reduce global climate change, rural poverty and biodiversity
losses remains difficult because:</p>
<ul>
<li>growing
     saplings in a nursery is expensive and time consuming, requiring
     well-trained staff,</li>
<li>deforested
     areas are often steep and inaccessible, making it difficult to transport
     saplings, materials and labour to restoration sites and </li>
<li>the
     labour needed for tree planting, weeding, fertilizer application and
     monitoring etc. often exceeds the local labour pool. Local people are
     unwilling to do such arduous, temporary and low paid work in remote
     locations. </li>
</ul><p>This campaign is to fund a workshop to explore the
potential for automating some of the more difficult forest restoration tasks -
we're calling it ""<b>auto-restoration</b>"" - by improving drone and
visual recognition technologies and combining them with proven forest
restoration practices. Could a new generation of intelligent, autonomous ""<b>dendrones</b>""
locate seed trees and transmit their GPS co-ordinates to seed collectors? Or
could they be fitted with robotic arms to collect seeds themselves? How about
aerial seeding by drone or even auto-weeding and fertilizer application? Could
a drone be programmed to spray a non-residual, systemic herbicide on weeds,
without harming young trees? </p>
<p>To explore the feasibility of these and many other
ideas, we will bring together forest ecologists with technologists - drone
experts with seed experts, those working on plant taxonomy with those working
on visual recognition systems, in a workshop, to draft a research agenda that
will turn some of these concepts into reality.

<b><br/></b><p><b>What We Need &amp; What You Get</b></p>
<p>Here we ask for core funding to run the workshop.
The money will be spent to hire the venue, run the workshop, attract key
speakers and produce and distribute the proceedings, including the research
agenda. We aim to raise matching funds from academic sources and a small
registration fee, for those who can afford it, to cover catering. However,
those who could benefit most from auto-restoration - community groups and NGO's
- are unlikely to pay a registration fee, so for those groups we would like to
sponsor them with the money raised from this campaign.</p>
<p><b>The Impact</b></p>
<p>Tropical forest restoration is a hot topic just
now, especially since the UN global climate change committee recently
recognized ""enhancement of carbon stocks"", i.e. planting trees to
suck up carbon dioxide, as qualifying for carbon credits. But to restore enough forest to enable local communities to tap into
carbon credits, we need to think beyond hauling basketfuls of saplings and
50-kg-bags of fertilizer 10's of kilometres on foot often across rugged
terrain. </p>
<p>Restored forests also provide a wealth of products and ecological services to local people -
everything from mushrooms and medicinal plants to simply being able to take a shower
in the dry season. Tropical forest restoration also helps to conserve the
millions of plant and animal species that live in such forests. Therefore, it
also has a major role to play in reducing species extinctions and maintaining
global biodiversity.</p>
<p><b>Risks &amp; Challenges</b></p>
<p>Automated forest restoration is an entirely new
field and there's no guarantee that enough people will take it seriously. It's
been a struggle to get people from such diverse backgrounds as aeronautics,
seed technology, computer science and ecology to commit to a 4-day workshop in
Thailand. But FORRU-CMU has a long track record of running successful
workshops, so we are confident that this one will also be a success. </p>

<h3>The Impact of OUR Project</h3>
<p>Honeybees polinate 40% of the food we consume. As industrialized beekeeping interferes with the bees' natural lifestyle patterns, our polinators are disappearing and dying off. We believe that by returning to a more natural style of beekeeping, and encouraging others to do the same, we can begin to reverse the damage done to the species worldwide.</p>
<p>At our Sanctuary, we have already held more than 20 beekeeping workshops, during which participants gain an understanding of the beehive as a superorganism, and practical hands-on experience in building and maintaining a natural top-bar hive.</p>
<p>Through our workshops, participants gain the knowledge and experience necessary to begin their own sustainable beehive at home.</p>
<p>Located on a main tourist route between Cusco and the Inca ruins of Machu Picchu and surrounded by the stunning Andes mountains, we are able to reach an international audience and expand our impact on a global level.</p>

At our Sanctuary, we have already held more than 20 beekeeping workshops, during which participants gain an understanding of the beehive as a superorganism, and practical hands-on experience in building and maintaining a natural top-bar hive.
Through our workshops, participants gain the knowledge and experience necessary to begin their own sustainable beehive at home.
Located on a main tourist route between Cusco and the Inca ruins of Machu Picchu and surrounded by the stunning Andes mountains, we are able to reach an international audience and expand our impact on a global level.

<h2>What Is Permaculture?</h2>
<center><img alt=""Living Wall"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.permaculturedesigntraining.com/imgs/indie/greenwall.jpg"" src="""" style=""vertical-align: middle;""/></center>
<p>Permaculture is the extension of the art of biomimicry - a sustainable living and design science rooted in observation of nature; permaculture is to sustainability what math is to physics.  Nature has long solved many of the environmental and social problems we're facing today, but we just have not been paying much attention.  </p>
<p>While many people think of permaculture as gardening, that’s a lot like thinking of math as being about building bridges. Permaculture is much larger than gardening. Permaculture is a sustainable design science rooted in observation of natural patterns. For example, the same branching pattern of a tree is present in every river, as well as in our own bodies — the pattern maximizes edge, increases diversity, and serves at least a dozen other functions. The very concepts of diversity increasing stability of natural living systems and edge increasing diversity are core permaculture teachings.</p>
<p>By observing the way nature works and then applying the same patterns and principles we learn to design truly sustainable, extremely resilient systems on any level – that can be a garden, a business or a whole city.<br/><br/></p>

<p>Bristol Bay hosts the largest wild salmon run left on earth. It is threatened by the construction of what would be the largest open pit gold mine in the world. My son, Aube, and I decided to ride across America to draw attention to the struggle to keep the mine from being built.</p>
<p>My husband, Dan, and I are long-time Alaskans.  Our son, Aube, was born in Palmer.  Our family has fished for salmon for many years.  For 10 years we setnetted on the Egegik River in Bristol Bay.  Today three of our four sons fish the Bay commercially.  In the picture displayed on this site, our son, Luke, took the picture of his boat, the <em>Mistral</em>, and his wife, Adrianne, is on the bow of the center boat.  Our other son, Dunedin, holds the banner aboard the <em>Mistral.</em></p>
<p>The region has been home to Native people for 10,000 years, and they are largely united in the fight to protect their homeland and keep foreign companies from developing this mine.  The stakes are huge – the largest open pit gold/copper/molybdenum mine in the world – and the potential destruction of a thriving ecosystem that has nurtured a culture for thousands of years.  The fishing industry provides not only nutrition for thousands, but jobs in Alaska, the Pacific Northwest, throughout the United States and beyond.  This is a huge and renewable resource that is managed responsibly, and is nothing less than a national treasure.</p>
<p>The Pebble Mine proponents say that they can protect the environment, but in the history of mountaintop mining, this has <em>never</em> been accomplished.  If you research the legacy of mines of this type, they leave a tale of destruction and contamination in their wake. </p>
<p>The salmon fishery of Bristol Bay, along with other fisheries in the adjacent Bering Sea, comprises one of the richest resources in the world.  Together they provide over half of the seafood harvested in the States.  This is too valuable a resource to endanger by the construction of what could be an environmental disaster. Ten billion tons of toxic waste will be generated by this mine, and they hope to hold back this contamination by building a dam two miles wide.  This is an area renowned for its earthquakes and seismic activity.  They claim the dam will last for perpetuity, and will forever hold back the toxic waste from sensitive streams where the salmon spawn each year.</p>
<p>Many organizations, both national and Alaska-based, have joined forces to stop the mine and protect Bristol Bay.  The <em>Pebble Partnership</em>, the front organization behind <em>Anglo America,</em> headquartered in England, and their partner <em>Northern Dynasty</em>, operating out of Canada, have huge financial resources to push for construction of the mine.  We need grassroots funding to counter their propaganda, and so we are riding from coast to coast to highlight the battle taking place in southwest Alaska.</p>
<p>All monies received will go to the <em>Renewable Resources Coalition</em>, an Anchorage-based organization at the forefront of the fight.</p>
<p>My husband, Dan, co-founded a movement called <em>Musicians United to Protect Bristol Bay</em> (<a href=""http://www.musiciansunited.info/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.musiciansunited.info</a>).  This has the same goal… to stop the mine… and is bringing the power and spirit of music to the fight.  The mining corporations have told us we cannot win, that they will, if nothing else, outlast us.  We don’t believe they have come up against the strength and dedication that Alaskan fishermen can bring to the battle, nor the same strength and dedication that environmentally conscious people across America can add.</p>
<p>As we ride, we will try to educate people to the issue, using radio and media to get the word out and explain the issues.  Please help!  It would be a travesty to allow the destruction of a productive healthy ecosystem that has existed for millennium, for short term profits going to foreign corporations.</p>
<p>We have set a goal of $10,000, and a time line of 100 days.  All of this money will go into fighting the <em>Pebble Partnership</em>.  Advertisements cost money.  Booths at fairs and conferences, staffed by educated caring individuals, require funds.  We don’t have the deep pockets that <em>Anglo America</em> or <em>Northern Dynasty</em> does, but with your help, we can use what money we do raise to lobby wisely and counter the lies and mistruths spread by the mine proponents.   Thank you so much for your interest and passion.</p>

Five palm tree islands are surrounded by turquoise waters and spectacular coral reefs.The marine park is a sanctuary for tropical fish.Guess where the greatest abundance of parrotfish in the Grenadines is found. That's right - Tobago Cays Marine Park! Parrotfish play a crucial role in keeping coral reefs healthy.The Tobago Cays Marine Park is also very important for endangered green and hawksbill sea turtles, which feed in the coral reefs and seagrass beds and nest on the white sand beaches.We are proud to share our natural paradise with thousands of visitors each year, who fly or sail here from all corners of the globe. The beach at Petite Bateau is one of the main attractions, and you can see why!The park is not only important for marine life, but also for local communities. Over 200 people make their living as beach BBQ chefs, water taxi operators, tour guides and vendors. The need for a ranger base and washroomSadly, our marine life is under threat. Illegal fishing and poaching of sea turtles is taking place, especially at night when the rangers are off duty. There is an urgent need for a base so that rangers can maintain 24-hour security.There is also a need for an environmentally friendly washroom facility. The current latrine cannot meet the needs of the thousands of visitors and its waste eventually reaches the sea, threatening water quality and marine life. It is also far off in the bushes and a safety concern.The solutionA facility containing eco-friendly composting toilets will provide a clean, sanitary experience for 100% of park users while causing zero discharge to the environment.The building will contain living quarters for rangers and an information desk where visitors can obtain information and assistance.The facility will enable rangers to maintain a 24-hour presence in the park for the first time, enabling night time patrols to reduce illegal poaching and fishing. As a result of your support…
Everyone in the park – visitors, vendors, rangers – will benefit from a pleasant, safe, sanitary and environmentally friendly washroom.
The water of the Tobago Cays Marine Park will stay crystal clear.
Turtles, fish and other marine life will be safer from poaching.Visitor safety will be improved through 24-hour park security. Earn amazing perksTo show our appreciation, we are giving our donors some lovely perks. For donations of different sizes, we will...Write your name in the sand at Petite Bateau and place a photo in our ""Hall of Sponsors"" in the finished facility!Send you an official Tobago Cays Marine Park shirt!Take you on an exclusive behind the scenes tour with the park rangers!Paint your company name on the facility for tens of thousands to see!For each level of perk, you also receive all the perks for smaller donations. So if you give $90, for example, you recieve the $90 perk and the $50 perk. Extra perkiness!Who we areThe Tobago Cays Marine Park is managed by the Government of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines through a team of 19 park rangers and office staff based on Union Island. Sustainable Grenadines Inc. (SusGren) is a local non-profit organization that is empowering communities in the Grenadines to protect the environment. We are working together to construct this facility.What we needThe total cost of our project is $76,500. We have already secured $61,000 from several funding agencies. We need $15,500 to complete the project. We are excited to have almost reached our goal and we are calling on local companies and park visitors to help us reach the finish line!TABLE 1 – Funding needed.

<p><b>We are a public funded expedition and in need your help to support Antarctic science. </b></p>
<p>2013-2014 marks the centenary of the Australasian Antarctic Expedition led by the great scientist and explorer Sir Douglas Mawson. The amazing tales of adventure, science and tragedy associated with Mawson’s endeavor rank alongside those of Scott, Shackleton and Amundsen and yet this was the most ambitious of them all: three bases, thirty-one land based members, seven major sledging journeys and a full oceanographic program across the Southern Ocean and Antarctica. Mawson’s expedition of 1911-1914 gave the world its first complete scientific snapshot  of a new continent. His team explored a vast stretch of eastern Antarctica; discovered new bays, mountains and glaciers; and linked up areas that were previously thought to be in isolation. The resulting 89 scientific reports described Antarctica’s violent and extreme weather, its flourishing plant and animal life, the ocean’s fickleness. </p>
<p>In a celebration of this remarkable endeavour, the new Australasian Antarctic Expedition (or AAE for short) is following the route of its namesake. The three years’s worth of observations gleaned by Mawson and his men provide a unique dataset against which we can compare changes seen today. Drawing on the original datasets of the AAE, we are looking to meld science and adventure, to discover and communicate the changes that have taken place in this remote environment over the last hundred years. Led by Professor Chris Turney and Dr Chris Fogwill, from the University of New South Wales, Sydney, the 2013-2014 expedition is now working its way across the Southern Ocean. By mid-December, we will be attempting to cross the 60 kilometres of sea ice in Commonwealth Bay to reach Mawson’s Antarctic base at Cape Denison, the windiest place on Earth in the ‘Home of the Blizzard’.</p>
<p><b>We are going south to:</b></p>

<p><b>The Impact</b></p>
<p>The Australasian Antarctic Expedition 2013-2014 is all about adventure, exploration, scientific discovery, and communication. We are exploring one of the most remote regions on our planet. In spite of over a century of discovery – including aerial and satellite surveys – remarkably little has been explored. Crucially this pristine southern polar region is uniquely placed to monitor the health of our planet. The AAE has a team of scientists who are world experts in the natural and physical sciences while also being passionate about science communication. To help with this, the AAE is using the latest satellite technology to support a full range of social media, including Google+ Hangouts on Air, Twitter and YouTube, to report our first findings directly to you live from Antarctica and the Southern Ocean. We want our findings to reach the public and policy makers as soon as possible. </p>
<p><b>By supporting our campaign you will be helping us support scientific observation in Antarctica’s Commonwealth Bay, the Southern Ocean and subantarctic islands to provide the first complete snapshot of this region for a century.</b></p>
<p><b>Other Ways You Can Help</b></p>
<p>Whilst not everyone can contribute directly to this campaign, we would love you to join us on the AAE.

Crucially this pristine southern polar region is uniquely placed to monitor the health of our planet. The AAE has a team of scientists who are world experts in the natural and physical sciences while also being passionate about science communication. To help with this, the AAE is using the latest satellite technology to support a full range of social media, including Google+ Hangouts on Air, Twitter and YouTube, to report our first findings directly to you live from Antarctica and the Southern Ocean. We want our findings to reach the public and policy makers as soon as possible. 
By supporting our campaign you will be helping us support scientific observation in Antarctica’s Commonwealth Bay, the Southern Ocean and subantarctic islands to provide the first complete snapshot of this region for a century.
Other Ways You Can Help
Whilst not everyone can contribute directly to this campaign, we would love you to join us on the AAE. For more information of how to join the expedition virtually please go to www.spiritofmawson.com and watch out for the Hangouts on Air we are hosting during our voyage.  Please spread the word with your friends, either through our web page, or with the Indiegogo share tools!!!",0.0,0,"3 Campaigns

<b>Isn't
cycling in Cairo impossible?  </b>
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
No.
Cairo
is basically
a flat city.</p>
<p>
The
traffic is actually easy to navigate. The average speed during rush
hour is around 16km an hour. So with a little sign language and the
right attitude you’ll
be dashing through those stagnant cars in no time. 
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
Add
to that the fact that the inner-city neighborhoods are relatively
compact, and you'll start to see why a bicycle might be the answer to
our collective traffic traumas.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
There’s
a reason the bread, gas and milk guys have always used bikes.</p>

<p><b>Short Summary</b></p>
<p>Hello, my name is Colby and I'm from Salt Lake City, Utah.
I started the GiveSTONG Foundation 5 years ago with the goal to provide a Thanksgiving or Christmas meal to families in need. We deliver
the baskets all across the Wasatch Front covering 50 to 60 miles. I
started with two families, and I have doubled the number of families I help
each year; which brings the family total for this year to 64. </p>
<p>I
started this charity because giving back and family are important to me. It is
my mission to provide a meal to underprivileged families, so they can
focus on family and enjoy this time of the year. Up to this point I have self
funded these meals along with close friends and family; with your help, we can reach
the goal for this year, and bring the holiday spirit to 64 families.</p>

Impact
In the previous years, when the families open the door and see the dinners their eyes light up with joy. The kids help me unpack with smiles on their faces, and the holiday spirit fills the room. The families always express how grateful and humbled they are by this act of service. Many times, this is what makes their Thanksgiving or Christmas dinner possible. I have learned that helping other families through the holidays, and seeing their smiles, is the best gift I can give. This year you can be part of it, and feel the joy that helping others brings to your life.

<h2>
<b>Interest Piqued. </b><b>Why do I need a sprinkler system smarter than me?</b>
</h2>
<b>Green Rain will save you time, money, and help the planet, too!</b><span style=""font-weight: normal;""> I have 5 live prototypes and the data from them shows an average of 35% savings off of their water bills!  </span><b>Did you know each sprinkler zone can use up to 15 gallons per minute?</b><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">  The amount of water and money saved is going to be dependent on the number of zones you have and the climate you live in.  The more zones, the more you save!  Also, you will be thrilled when it rains.  </span><p></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;""></span></p>
<p><br/></p></span><p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h2><b>Sounds cool. Who thought this up?</b></h2>
<p>I grew up with a number of physical disabilities and people telling me I could not do things. <span style=""font-weight: normal;""> Being 26 years old and already sporting a fake hip and a spine held up by titanium, a lot of people would probably side with the nay-sayers.  I’ve earned a Bachelor’s in Computer Science and Engineering from the University of Notre Dame, been a web and systems developer, and now in my career have moved into a position where I am in front of the client and working with more real-world application of products.  </span></p>
<b>But technology isn’t just my job.</b><span style=""font-weight: normal;""> My entire house is automated by a system I built and is controlled based on where my phone is.  If my phone gets close to the door, it unlocks.  If I walk into the bedroom, the lights turn on.  My coffee maker turns on when my alarm goes off.  No user interaction is the name of the game.  It made so much sense that our sprinkler systems should do the same.  Smart systems are way cooler than smart people!</span><p><br/></p>
<h2>How well has this been working?</h2>
<p>There are 5 live prototypes who have been gathering data and working really well.  I have worked through a number of issues with keeping WiFi connected and sorted out some issues with the Weather API.</p>
<p><a href=""http://www.getgreenrain.com/graphs/zoneGraph.php?zone=1"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Click here to view a graph of prototype data!</a><br/></p>
<p>You will notice in the above link that the amount of rain drastically decreases the amount of water used by the sprinklers.  If this person put their sprinklers on a typical schedule, they would run it for 1.5 inches per week.  BUT, with Green Rain installed, you will notice it <b>only ran a full cycle ONCE in the last 3 months</b>!</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<h2><b>You got me!  Full details, please!</b></h2>
<p></p>
<h4><span>Green Rain has a number of features that make it invaluable to your lawn:</span></h4>
<p></p>
<ul><li>
<b>It's built to last.  </b>A Raspberry Pi is the system driving the brains of the system. The IO ports are converted to 24V so they can properly start and stop the sprinkler heads.  The system can be on at all times with very little energy consumption. This system is capped off by a simple Wifi dongle built in. There is also an SD Card holding the brains which makes it very easy for me to  duplicate. All of this is wrapped in an enclosure which can be mounted near your sprinkler controller.</li></ul>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/151286/files/20131023190221-IMAG0035.jpg?1382580141"" src="""" style=""width: 548.3125px; height: 310px;""/></p>
<br/><p></p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>It’s smart.</b> <span style=""font-weight: normal;""> It uses historical weather data, present weather conditions, and future forecasts to read the condition of the lawn and what weather is coming. If the lawn is saturated, or if rain is coming, Green Rain holds off watering. Likewise, if the lawn is thirsty, it turns on to keep the lawn perfectly hydrated.<br/></span>
</li>
<li>
<b>It adapts.</b> <span style=""font-weight: normal;"">It pulls the weather results from yesterday and the prediction for the current day.  In time, it will start to learn which predictions are most accurate.  An 80% chance of rain may mean something completely different in Seattle than it does in Las Vegas. </span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>It communicates.</b><span style=""font-weight: normal;""> You will get emails notifying you of the lawn’s status and why the sprinklers did or did not run.  </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;""><b><b>The Algorithm embedded in Green Rain has been filed for a US Patent</b></b></span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;""><b><b><br/></b></b></span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2><span><b>Beautiful. How hard is the set up?</b></span></h2>
<h4><span>You will need the following to hook it up</span></h4>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>An existing, installed in-ground sprinkler system</li>
<li>
<span>WiFi, but if you don’t have it, it does support a wired Ethernet connection to your router</span><br/>
</li>
<li><span>A zip code</span></li>
</ul>
<h4>But from there, setup is super simple</h4>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>
<span>Connect Green Rain to your zones and power on the system</span><br/>
</li>
<li><span><span>Search for networks on your tablet or laptop and find the access point “Green Rain”</span><br/></span></li>
<li><span><span><span>Connect to that access point and navigate your browser to connect to the system<br/></span><span>Green Rain will then guide you through the existing zone schedule and connecting to your home Wifi.</span><br/></span></span></li>
<li><span><span><span><span>YOU WILL NEVER NEED TO TOUCH IT AGAIN!</span></span></span></span></li>

<h2><span>So what’s the plan? What will you do with my money?</span></h2>
<b>I need a little help to move this from a prototype to a final product.</b>  I have all of the coding done and an awesome prototype but it will be hard to distribute 500 units if I am sitting in my spare bedroom building each unit by hand.  This thing looks exactly like you would expect it to having been produced in my home office.  I want to turn this into a smooth-looking injection molded unit that you would be proud to mount on your wall.  The brains of the system are there - the design around it is not.  Unfortunately, that is the expensive part.<p></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<h2>Where I want to take this</h2>
<p><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.45em; color: rgb(34, 34, 34);""><b>I would love to see Green Rain in thousands of households.  At that point, we will see a significant water consumption impact made. A couple of ideas...</b></span></p>
<ul>
<li>An online login where you can easily view the amount of water and money you are saving.  Share this with your friends and compare to other homes in your region and outside your region.</li>
<li>A manufactured board that has the Raspberry Pi, Wifi and Sprinkler board built into one unit.</li>
</ul>
<br/><p></p>
<p></p>
<h2><b>Enough questions. My promise to you</b></h2>
<p><b>If setbacks arise, I will work through them.</b> I really believe in this idea and am willing to work tirelessly or recruit whoever I need to jump any hurdles.</p>
<p>The main challenge here will be manufacturing and quality control. Currently, I pay a great amount of attention to make sure each prototype I create is working perfectly. I run a gambit of unit tests and do physical tests where I connect it to test sprinkler heads.</p>I currently build each one and just mirror the SD card to bring them all to the same state. I am not afraid of producing this on a large scale and think it will be a lot of fun!<p></p>

I have 5 live prototypes and the data from them shows an average of 35% savings off of their water bills!  Did you know each sprinkler zone can use up to 15 gallons per minute?  The amount of water and money saved is going to be dependent on the number of zones you have and the climate you live in.  The more zones, the more you save!  Also, you will be thrilled when it rains.  




Sounds cool. Who thought this up?
I grew up with a number of physical disabilities and people telling me I could not do things.  Being 26 years old and already sporting a fake hip and a spine held up by titanium, a lot of people would probably side with the nay-sayers.  I’ve earned a Bachelor’s in Computer Science and Engineering from the University of Notre Dame, been a web and systems developer, and now in my career have moved into a position where I am in front of the client and working with more real-world application of products.  
But technology isn’t just my job. My entire house is automated by a system I built and is controlled based on where my phone is.  If my phone gets close to the door, it unlocks.  If I walk into the bedroom, the lights turn on.  My coffee maker turns on when my alarm goes off.  No user interaction is the name of the game.  It made so much sense that our sprinkler systems should do the same.  Smart systems are way cooler than smart people!
How well has this been working?
There are 5 live prototypes who have been gathering data and working really well.  I have worked through a number of issues with keeping WiFi connected and sorted out some issues with the Weather API.
Click here to view a graph of prototype data!
You will notice in the above link that the amount of rain drastically decreases the amount of water used by the sprinklers.  If this person put their sprinklers on a typical schedule, they would run it for 1.5 inches per week.  BUT, with Green Rain installed, you will notice it only ran a full cycle ONCE in the last 3 months!


You got me!  Full details, please!

Green Rain has a number of features that make it invaluable to your lawn:


It's built to last.  A Raspberry Pi is the system driving the brains of the system. The IO ports are converted to 24V so they can properly start and stop the sprinkler heads.  The system can be on at all times with very little energy consumption. This system is capped off by a simple Wifi dongle built in. There is also an SD Card holding the brains which makes it very easy for me to  duplicate. All of this is wrapped in an enclosure which can be mounted near your sprinkler controller.





It’s smart.  It uses historical weather data, present weather conditions, and future forecasts to read the condition of the lawn and what weather is coming. If the lawn is saturated, or if rain is coming, Green Rain holds off watering. Likewise, if the lawn is thirsty, it turns on to keep the lawn perfectly hydrated.


It adapts. It pulls the weather results from yesterday and the prediction for the current day.  In time, it will start to learn which predictions are most accurate.  An 80% chance of rain may mean something completely different in Seattle than it does in Las Vegas. 


It communicates. You will get emails notifying you of the lawn’s status and why the sprinklers did or did not run.

Beautiful. How hard is the set up?
You will need the following to hook it up


An existing, installed in-ground sprinkler system

WiFi, but if you don’t have it, it does support a wired Ethernet connection to your router

A zip code

But from there, setup is super simple




Connect Green Rain to your zones and power on the system

Search for networks on your tablet or laptop and find the access point “Green Rain”
Connect to that access point and navigate your browser to connect to the systemGreen Rain will then guide you through the existing zone schedule and connecting to your home Wifi.
YOU WILL NEVER NEED TO TOUCH IT AGAIN!



So what’s the plan? What will you do with my money?
I need a little help to move this from a prototype to a final product.  I have all of the coding done and an awesome prototype but it will be hard to distribute 500 units if I am sitting in my spare bedroom building each unit by hand.  This thing looks exactly like you would expect it to having been produced in my home office.  I want to turn this into a smooth-looking injection molded unit that you would be proud to mount on your wall.  The brains of the system are there - the design around it is not.  Unfortunately, that is the expensive part.


Where I want to take this
I would love to see Green Rain in thousands of households.  At that point, we will see a significant water consumption impact made. A couple of ideas...

An online login where you can easily view the amount of water and money you are saving.  Share this with your friends and compare to other homes in your region and outside your region.
A manufactured board that has the Raspberry Pi, Wifi and Sprinkler board built into one unit.



Enough questions. My promise to you
If setbacks arise, I will work through them. I really believe in this idea and am willing to work tirelessly or recruit whoever I need to jump any hurdles.
The main challenge here will be manufacturing and quality control. Currently, I pay a great amount of attention to make sure each prototype I create is working perfectly. I run a gambit of unit tests and do physical tests where I connect it to test sprinkler heads.I currently build each one and just mirror the SD card to bring them all to the same state. I am not afraid of producing this on a large scale and think it will be a lot of fun!


Please share my project if you made it this far!  If you don't want to contribute, please let me know why!

Metals, Heavy Damage</b></p>
<p>
</p><p>Mining and mineral processing
can be important sources of economic growth and development. In order to ensure
that Armenia fully maximizes the benefits from developing these industries,
the environmental and public health risks associated with mining must be
identified, measured and adequately assessed.</p>
<p>
Today, Armenia is facing a crucial choice. It can continue on mining path
that gives no consideration to its environmental and public health consequences
or it can begin a new chapter. It can begin a chapter where environmental
impacts are measured, public health risks in communities are properly assessed
and international best practices are introduced to ensure the environmental,
social and economic well-being of communities all over Armenia.  </p>
<p>To do this, WE NEED YOUR HELP.</p>
<p></p><p></p><p><b>Irresponsible Mining is Undermining Our Health</b></p>
<p>
</p><p>Impacts resulting from mineral extraction and
processing include: heavy metals contamination, acid rock drainage (ARD), tailings
deposits and harmful particulate emissions. These may all impact the soil,
water, plants, animals and air that communities rely on for their welfare and
livelihood. These pollutants also often enter people’s organisms, with dire
health consequences.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Take lead, for example: overexposure to this
common metal can cause diminished IQ’s in children, fertility problems in both
men and women, as well as digestive issues and serious nervous system ailments.
Other heavy metals such as Mercury, Cadmium, Chromium VI, act as carcinogens.
These also negatively impact fertility and cause respiratory and digestive
ailments—a pretty heavy legacy to leave, especially in such a small country.</p>

Currently 22 of the over 400 active mines in Armenia are metal mines. These
mines deposit heavy-metal pollutants into the environment affecting the land,
water, and air in nearby communities. Poor monitoring and enforcement of
regulations leaves these communities exposed to toxic pollution. Independent
monitoring will empower these communities to take the first step in making
mining more accountable and responsible.
Your donation will help purchase urgently needed ENVIRONMENTAL
LABORATORY EQUIPMENT that will enable scientists at the
American
University of Armenia’s Center for Responsible Mining to survey the
impacts of mining in Armenia, to inform affected citizens of these impacts and
to find solutions that preserve the health and quality of communities and their
environment.


Heavy
Metals, Heavy Damage

Mining and mineral processing
can be important sources of economic growth and development. In order to ensure
that Armenia fully maximizes the benefits from developing these industries,
the environmental and public health risks associated with mining must be
identified, measured and adequately assessed.

Today, Armenia is facing a crucial choice. It can continue on mining path
that gives no consideration to its environmental and public health consequences
or it can begin a new chapter. It can begin a chapter where environmental
impacts are measured, public health risks in communities are properly assessed
and international best practices are introduced to ensure the environmental,
social and economic well-being of communities all over Armenia.  
To do this, WE NEED YOUR HELP.
Irresponsible Mining is Undermining Our Health

Impacts resulting from mineral extraction and
processing include: heavy metals contamination, acid rock drainage (ARD), tailings
deposits and harmful particulate emissions. These may all impact the soil,
water, plants, animals and air that communities rely on for their welfare and
livelihood. These pollutants also often enter people’s organisms, with dire
health consequences.

Take lead, for example: overexposure to this
common metal can cause diminished IQ’s in children, fertility problems in both
men and women, as well as digestive issues and serious nervous system ailments.
Other heavy metals such as Mercury, Cadmium, Chromium VI, act as carcinogens.
These also negatively impact fertility and cause respiratory and digestive
ailments—a pretty heavy legacy to leave, especially in such a small country.
The
Project
The AUA Center for Responsible Mining is asking for your help in equipping our environmental laboratory with instruments that will detect
the presence and concentration of major pollutants, such as lead, mercury, arsenic, cadmium and copper, in soil, water
and inside people’s bodies. This will allow the AUA and its team of leading
environmental scientists to carry out precise and accurate tests in all
affected communities on a regular basis, thus providing an important
evidence-based advocacy and compliance tool. The AUA Center for Responsible Mining will also train and
engage civil society organizations to participate in independent monitoring of
pollution in affected communities.

Phase I: ONEArmenia will crowdfund in
order to raise the first $29,664 ($24,000 goes to AUA and $5,664 are fees for developing this campaign) of the total $75,000 that is needed. These
funds will enable the AUA Environmental Center to purchase portable equipment
for the rapid on-site assessment of 5 of the toxic heavy metals found in soil
and water: arsenic, cadmium, copper, mercury and lead. These portable
instruments have a detection range of parts per million (ppm), which is
sufficient to detect medium to high levels of contamination. Phase I also
includes the acquisition of a portable analyzer that will measure lead
concentrations in blood.



Phase 2: $51,000 will be raised
through matching grants.  If you add the $24,000 raised + the matching grants it gives us the $75,000 needed. These funds will go towards completing the purchase of
all the basic instruments identified in Phase I, as well as a powerful
stationary instrument known as the
graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrophotometer (GFAAS).   This
spectrophotometer will enable the detection of 50 toxic heavy metals, in both
the soil and water with a high degree of accuracy and reliability, in the
range of parts per billion (ppb). This is the level of detection sensitivity
specified in the World Health Organization guidelines and the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency. The AUA lab will carry out advanced fieldwork
and educational, community outreach.
About AUA CRM

He masterminded and built the mill, maintained the roads up the mountain with equipment he designed himself, imported steel to build bridges across rivers and reservoirs, and created a small chapel called Capilla de San José de Cincinnati with an adjoining chapel cemetery for the family and over 100 workers. Orlando even installed a plantation store with tokens minted for workers to buy much-needed items rather than going into town, a seven hour trip by mule down the mountain to Santa Marta. <br/><br/>Orlando eventually consolidated the plantations into the famous Santa Marta Coffee Company, Inc in 1927 and became a founding member of the Federacion Nacional de Cafeteros de Colombia.

WHY save this mountaintop?
Did you know...




NBC recent news article names the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta ""the #1 RANKED most irreplaceable area to be protected IN THE WORLD!


Officially, Colombia has the most bird species ON EARTH: 1,871 different species, or 1/5 of all bird species
known on earth. This is why
my American grandfather traveled there to study birds in the first place, fell in love with my grandmother whose family grew coffee, and stayed a lifetime. He spent half a century in the region, discovering and documenting the wildlife, because of this rich density of birds in Colombia.


The Sierra Nevada de
Santa Marta mountain range has the highest concentration of endemic birds on the planet. The reserve is recognized by over 60 conservation
organizations worldwide through the Alliance for Zero Extinction: WWF, World Land Trust, American Bird
Conservancy, The Nature Conservancy, etc and is recognized as a UNESCO Biosphere site.

ONLY 1/8 of the area is
currently protected. It is still at a high risk of deforestation, property
developments and invasion of non-native plant species. The potential loss could be devastating.  The Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta has one of the
highest concentrations on the planet of globally threatened birds, amphibians,
and plants. Many of the species of
birds my ornithologist grandfather first discovered and studied there will become extinct due to destruction of natural habitat if nothing is done.  
The opportunity to drive significant conservation change in Colombia in particular is immense and the time is now:  There is an intense
environmental awareness building among the people and government of Colombia. 
Protecting the wildlife of the Sierra Nevada de
Santa Marta region will increase ecotourism, help stabilize the region
economically and in turn, politically. Helping the birds helps everyone! Together we can make a difference! 

What will the film be about? 
The feature film documentary will bring awareness through a gripping and entertaining character-driven storytelling style, including interviews with a variety of colorful, fascinating, important and sometimes humorous people with links to the nature reserve and Colombian history.Because of our personal legacy, this film will have heart and bring an intimacy to the complex subject matter of environmental preservation.Telling this story will weave the important geopolitical and environmental issues together, generating further awareness to conservation efforts and their role as a catalyst for promoting peace and sustainable development, while generating a healthy tourism trade around this reserve in Colombia.Its groundbreaking approach can also serve as a model for private environmental efforts in other regions in the world. 
WHAT makes this story unique?
OUR FAMILY HISTORY IN COLOMBIA:The Carriker Bird Sanctuary

We have an intense history with the birds of Colombia. My grandfather, Melbourne (Meb) Armstrong Carriker, Jr. (1879-1965) was one of the renowned naturalists of his time, working extensively with the Smithsonian, the Carnegie Museum; the American Museum of Natural History; the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia; and the Peabody Museum as an ornithologist throughout South America, covering Costa Rica, Trinidad, Venezuela, and Curacao Island, and canvassing Peru, Bolivia, and Colombia almost entirely.
During his career Meb was responsible for the description of two new families, four new subfamilies, fifty three new genera and subgenera, and eight hundred sixty-six new species and subspecies. Between 1940 and 1959 he produced thirty-three papers.
Due to the extensive naturalist work my grandfather accomplished before his death in 1965, and to honor his scientific legacy in the region, Colombia has named a wildlife sanctuary after him called ""THE CARRIKER BIRD SANCTUARY"".

COLOMBIAN
COFFEE:A love story for the land
A LITTLE FAMILY HISTORY ON THE ORIGINS OF OUR COFFEE GROWING DAYS IN COLOMBIA:
Our family was one of the first to grow coffee in this region and had three of the largest Colombian coffee plantations of the early 1900's: Hacienda Cincinnati, Quinta Bolivar and eventually Vista Nieve.
It began in 1898 with Orlando Lincoln Flye, my great grandfather, and Eva Florence Adelaine Blanot Flye, my great grandmother, who first created the coffee plantation Hacienda Cincinnati, spanning 4,780 acres supporting a total of some 700,000 or more coffee trees in the San Lorenzo range, connected to the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta mountains. In recognition for his efforts as an engineer, and in building up the Colombian coffee industry, Orlando Flye was made an honorary citizen of Colombia.

Over the years, Orlando developed Hacienda Cincinnati into a first class plantation. He masterminded and built the mill, maintained the roads up the mountain with equipment he designed himself, imported steel to build bridges across rivers and reservoirs, and created a small chapel called Capilla de San José de Cincinnati with an adjoining chapel cemetery for the family and over 100 workers. Orlando even installed a plantation store with tokens minted for workers to buy much-needed items rather than going into town, a seven hour trip by mule down the mountain to Santa Marta. Orlando eventually consolidated the plantations into the famous Santa Marta Coffee Company, Inc in 1927 and became a founding member of the Federacion Nacional de Cafeteros de Colombia.





Today, Colombia Coffee is known and promoted throughout the world by the image and brand of ""Juan Valdez."" This famous symbol of Colombian Coffee was created by my great grandfather and other founding members of the Federacion, to help promote their coffee.

Hacienda Vista Nieve:From coffee plantation to wildlife sanctuaryWhen Meb Carriker, an already renowned ornithologist, first traveled to Santa Marta, Colombia in 1911 to study birds, he needed a base of operations in the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta mountain range to set up his research.At the US Consulate, Meb was introduced to my great-grandparents Orlando Flye and his wife Eva Florence. Being generous people, Orlando and Eva Florence promptly offered to host Meb on Hacienda Cincinnati. 
It was while carrying out his research trips from this plantation that Meb fell in love with Orlando and Eva Florence's eldest daughter, Carmelita, and the rest is history! Meb and Carmelita, my grandparents, were married, and raised a family (including my father) on their own coffee plantation, Vista Nieve, while continuing bird research in the mountains together. It is this plantation (no longer in operation), which has become the Carriker Bird Sanctuary, where we intend to support and extend ProAves groundbreaking land preservation efforts in the El Dorado Bird Reserve, which also incorporate land from the other two plantations La Victoria and Hacienda Cincinnati.

We have set TWO FINANCIAL GOALSOur first minimum goal is USD $185K:
100K of this initial amount will FIRST be used to expand the size of the existing Carriker Bird Sanctuary through ProAves.  It seems

The next 85K of this initial amount raised will then ensure that production and post-production costs for the shooting of a feature

PERKS!!!!  to help us thank you for your efforts in supporting us! See the
second tab on this campaign for photos of goodies and adventures!:) Check out
all the very thoughtful, delicious and meaningful gifts we offer to say THANK
YOU SO MUCH!!! We care that YOU care!
Why do it? You can tell your kids you
saved a beautiful mountaintop. Your name will be in the film. You can come to
Colombia to visit us!  Birds are beautiful. This cause is the real deal.
Real people. Real story. 
Our track record: We have
already created two successful kickstarters for
the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society (The Big CLIMB) that were both fully funded. These projects have helped to raise record amounts
of money for LLS in Seattle. We have also raised record amounts of money
through our film work for various schools in Seattle such as Lakeside school
and Villa Academy.
An example is on the LLS website for The
BIG CLIMB 2013 which cost USD $11K and helped runners raise USD $1.76 million in
one day. See:  
The Big Climb and 

The BIG CLIMB Kickstarter update
I have also directed my film team globally in extreme post-catastrophe conditions (e.g. Haiti, Peru,
Bangladesh, Dadaab Refugee camp etc), shooting over 3,000 hours of documentary footage. We know how to handle
ourselves in almost any condition to deliver the story. 
We have a top security team recruited
from Tier One Special Operations units to insure the safety, as needed of our team and
you, if you care to join us. 
Our comptroller, Stephen Mettler,
who has an MBA from Kellogg School of Management,
will be managing the production funds from the USA (Connecticut) as they are
donated through Indiegogo, to help guide us financially in the most prudent and
efficient manner. Your generous donations will be carefully managed in order to
reach our goals. 
Our second goal, in partnership with RAINFOREST TRUST is to raise 
USD $1.5 million total:
100%  will be used to
preserve the rainforest mountaintop of the Sierra Nevada de Santa
Marta. We wish to raise money to return all of the land on this
mountaintop to ProAves within our lifetime, in order to protect the birds and
wildlife of the region that our family knew so well. 
If we are able to generate the USD$1.5 million
level of support, we will host an event in Colombia, providing security so that
all participants in this campaign who are willing to travel to Colombia, can
witness the ribbon cutting event and celebrate their personal connection to
this specific area of the world and it's natural habitat. If there is a donor who wishes to offer this generous donation to the birds, their name can be added to the Reserve in their honor, AND they can donate directly to Rainforest Trust to receive full tax benefits (501c3 status).  Please see click here for more information on our partnership with Rainforest Trust and contact us directly for more details.
There are so many efforts
out there to support the rainforest but THIS ONE IS DIFFERENT. WHY?


For us, this is personal. My father was born on this land. My grandfather studied birds
and was one of the greatest ornithologists of his time. Many of the species of
birds that he first documented and studied will soon become extinct if nothing
is done. We take this work and our success personally. 


We will go down and
document the work with cameras. We will show the
land being bought and the work being done. You will see your funds hand
delivered in full and the work completed to secure these lands, through our
documentary effort. The film will also extend your
contribution beyond your generous act of local preservation to visibly encourage a wider environmental activism
and awareness.


You can go visit the work
you created. If we are successful with our stretch
goal of USD$1.5 million, we will host an event in Colombia, so that you may see the land you worked to preserve, firsthand.


ProAves is a group with a
sole purpose: to
support the land in this area and protect the birds. This smaller not for profit organization has incredible
credentials and an impeccable track record. ProAves has dedicated 12 years
to saving the most endangered habitats and species in Colombia. Their
science-based targeted actions have saved 627,773 acres across Colombia,
including the direct acquisition of over 50,000 acres of forests at imminent
risk of destruction, now protected forever. They are saving the planet's most
imperiled biodiversity. They work with poor rural communities to develop
sustainable economies and improve livelihoods. When you support ProAves

 you are supporting real conservation actions.


We will follow up with our efforts for a lifetime and over generations to continue to offer all we can to this
mountaintop. We have a history and a legacy there. It is a tribute to the work
of our ancestor, Melbourne Carriker who worked his entire lifetime - over 80
years - in the region to study and understand the birds there.
My daughter will be the 5th generation to witness the beautiful nature
of the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta, and is committed to supporting the conservation
efforts in the area.


GREAT, I AM IN! WHAT NOW?
Pick your price and your perk.
Remember our stretch goal.  After we reach our first goal of USD$100K for the initial land preservation, we
aren't finished. We still need 85K to create the documentary that will help us raise the 1.5 million and bring awareness.  Do what you can.
Every bit helps - big and small donations. It all adds up. You will be helping
the birds and a fragile habitat firsthand. Please help us get the word out. Put
this on your facebook page. Email it to your friends and family. Ask people to
help. Put it on your company website or your blog, or any other place where you
can spread the word.
If you are interested in participating at an Executive Producer level, please contact us directly.
If you feel this campaign would
be exciting for a corporate sponsor, and can help us on that front, please
contact us directly to further support the cause.
If you and/or your company would like to contribute a perk and align yourself with our cause, please contact us directly. 
If you are a journalist, please help us get
our story out to the world. We aren't shy because we want this to happen. Help
us make this a reality!!! We want to save a rainforest in Colombia. It's a big
effort, kind of intense and even a little dangerous. It's a woman and her
daughter with a big heart and a lot of history there. Can you help us make a difference?",10.0,0,"1 Campaign

SHOCK TOP BREWERY DONATES $100,000 to PROJECT: DROP-A-BRICK!!!!
Holy crap! Just when we thought we couldn't Drop-A-Brick in any more toilets, Shock Top and IndieGoGo dropped in to save the day! Now we're back in business. 

Waste-loving toilets, prepare to meet Drop-A-Brick 2.0.
The smartest toilet brick just got smarter. Thanks to a cash infusion of $100,000 from Shock Top Brewery and their Shock The Drought Campaign, we are able to scale production and offer thousands of FREE (er, you gotta pay for shipping) Drop-A-Bricks to aquaphiles, activists, environmentalists, and potty-joke lovers everywhere.

It's easy. Feels great. And helps the environment.
It's a win-win-win. Shock Top's initiative will literally save hundreds of thousands of gallons of water this year alone - and millions in the years to come.  Added bonus: another year of endless potty innuendo. 
We are so honored to have been chosen by such a great brewery and simply amazed by their social and environmental activism. Thank you Shock Top! Clearly, they are a brand that loves their home state of California and are serious about fighting the drought. Together, we will not be deturd!


SO, WHAT IS DROP-A-BRICK?



Drop-A-Brick is the non profit, eco-friendly innovation of the old (hippy) trick of placing a brick in a toilet's tank to save water. However unlike a real brick, Drop-A-Brick won't ruin your toilet. In fact, it actually improves flushing performance, all while saving about 50 gallons a week. If enough people use it, we can save millions of gallons every day. Learn more on our website.
Product Overview:

Saves about half a gallon every time you flush
Saves money on your water bills
Won't ruin your toilet like a regular brick
Squeeze it into toilet tanks, big or small
Actually improves flushing performance in most toilets
Unlike an old fashioned clay brick, it's soft and supple. Like a brick should be.





A NOT-PROFIT INITIATIVE

Created to fight the devastating California drought, Project Drop-A-Brick is a not-for-profit, grassroots, get 'er done initiative by a bunch of regular folks hoping to save as much water as possible in homes across America. You can choose to get one for yourself or to donate one directly to Rising Sun Energy Center, who will distribute and install Drop-A-Brick's to residents in need, saving families 50 gallons a week. Oh yeah, you'll save money on your water bills too. Every drop counts!










“We believe that by partnering with Project: Drop-A-Brick,
Rising Sun will be able to further its
mission to empower individuals to achieve environmental and economic
sustainability for themselves and their communities.”
- Jodi Pincus, Executive Director of Rising Sun Energy Center

California is facing a record drought. Many towns have no running water. Drop-A-Brick can help these families conserve 50 gallons of water per week.




The 2012-2014 North American drought is on track to become the costliest natural disaster in U.S. history. 


""Americans use more water each day by flushing than they do by showering or any other activity."" 
- Environmental Protection Agency

The vast majority of toilets in the U.S. are highly inefficient, needlessly wasting billions of gallons and millions of dollars, every day.










Fill it with a little bit of water. The hydro-gel inside will expand to 200 times it's original size, giving Drop-A-Brick the weight it needs to sink.




Wedge Drop-A-Brick vertically into your toilet's tank (or whichever way it fits best) and then replace the lid. Drop-A-Brick will displace about half a gallon, thereby tricking your toilet into using less water.











HELP FAMILIES IN NEED OF WATER SAVE 50 GALLONS A WEEK.



One Drop-A-Brick can save a household 2 gallons a day per person. For a family of four, that's 50 extra gallons a week that can be used for bathing, doing laundry and flushing the toilet. 












A NOTE ON TOILETS

If you're considering replacing your current toilet with a new, high efficiency toilet, please do so. The latest toilet models save the most water while still providing an awesome flush. Be sure to get in touch with your local water municipality and ask them about rebate programs.

<h2>A message from Sir David Attenborough</h2>
<p>""I first went to film mountain gorillas in Rwanda in 1978 for the BBC’s Life on Earth television series. Spending time with these gentle creatures in their natural habitat was a profoundly moving experience. It was abundantly clear, however, that a lethal cocktail of threats including poaching, human encroachment and habitat loss was driving these magnificent, gentle creatures to the very brink of extinction.</p>
<p>""I was so deeply concerned by the plight of the mountain gorillas that I came to Fauna &amp; Flora International for urgent discussions about how we could prevent them from disappearing for ever. With only around 250 mountain gorillas remaining in the Virungas Massif at this time, we knew we had to move fast.</p>
<p>""FFI brought together a group of conservation partners who,alongside the communities that live closest to the gorillas, have worked tirelessly to protect them and the forests they inhabit ever since.</p>
<p>""Thanks to this collaborative approach their population is steadily rising and today there are around 880 mountain gorillas in the wild. But these extraordinary animals are still Critically Endangered and there is much left to do if we are to ensure their long-term survival.</p><p>""By supporting this campaign and promoting it through your networks, you will not only be helping to secure a future for mountain gorillas, but also the tens of thousands of Rwandan, Ugandan and Congolese people who have come to depend upon them for their livelihoods and wellbeing.""</p>

It was abundantly clear, however, that a lethal cocktail of threats including poaching, human encroachment and habitat loss was driving these magnificent, gentle creatures to the very brink of extinction.
""I was so deeply concerned by the plight of the mountain gorillas that I came to Fauna & Flora International for urgent discussions about how we could prevent them from disappearing for ever. With only around 250 mountain gorillas remaining in the Virungas Massif at this time, we knew we had to move fast.
""FFI brought together a group of conservation partners who,alongside the communities that live closest to the gorillas, have worked tirelessly to protect them and the forests they inhabit ever since.
""Thanks to this collaborative approach their population is steadily rising and today there are around 880 mountain gorillas in the wild. But these extraordinary animals are still Critically Endangered and there is much left to do if we are to ensure their long-term survival.""By supporting this campaign and promoting it through your networks, you will not only be helping to secure a future for mountain gorillas, but also the tens of thousands of Rwandan, Ugandan and Congolese people who have come to depend upon them for their livelihoods and wellbeing.""
Sir David Attenborough, Fauna & Flora International vice-president

<h3>About My Project:</h3>
<p>I will set off in August...</p>
<p>My travels and studies in New Zealand and Asia have inspired me to continue to actively restore degraded ecosystems around the world. Thanks to my education at the University of California, Santa Barbara, and my extensive experience in restoration in California and overseas, I have been accepted into a kayak research expedition in Alaska's Inner Passage! I will spend six weeks kayaking throughout the region documenting various species as well as helping with in-place restoration projects that are improving destroyed land and maintaining the close relationship Alaskan government has with its Natives and their needs.</p>
<p>I was JUST offered the position on April 22nd, so I need to make a move on getting funding fast!</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What I Need and What YOU GET!!!</h3>
<p>The program costs $5000, and I was offered a $1500 scholarship --- that leaves $3500 I need to come up with... and QUICKLY! I will raise $1000 from work savings, bake sales, homebrewed kombucha, etc.... and hoping to get $2500 from you wonderful people! </p>
<p>Tatoosh School is the non-profit organization that conducts the research, and they are the ones that I must pay. Fees include flights, some gear, food, and education. I will need MANY layers, as I will be in a kayak most of the time in very cold weather!</p>
<p>If you donate:</p>
<p>$5, You will receive a personal thank you email, recognizing you for your support.</p>
<p>$10, You will receive you some incredible Santa Barbara made chocolate, as well as a thank you email.</p>
<p>$25, You will receive a personalized handmade (by me) bracelet, Santa Barbara chocolate, and a thank you email.</p>
<p>$50, You will receive a post card with a picture of me on my Alaska expedition, as well as the previous items.</p>
<p>$100, You will receive a copy of my personal field research journal upon completion, as well as previous items.</p>
<p>$200, You will receive a gift box of local, organic goodies from Santa Barbara, and all previous items.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Ecological restoration is an effective way of fixing many environmental problems humans have caused. My experience will be accentuated with the education Tatoosh School will give me on the expedition, and I will be able to carry out further work in the future.</p>
<p>In essence, restoration is a process where scientists actively heal sick land. This can include planting natives, reconstructing damaged wetlands, tracking endangered species, and long-term monitoring to ensure the project succeeds at re-establishing the integrity of a given ecosystem.</p>
<p>My research will be conducted on a very intimate level; I will be travling via sea kayak over 200 miles through difficult terrain and weather. In this way, I will gain a deep understanding of the way the ecosystem works, whilst seeking out ways to improve current management. As well, the research I will conduct will go on to educate more about the biota of the region.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Of course, not everyone can contribute financially- THAT IS OK!</p>
<p>Please spread the word about my campaign, and about ecological restoration in general. It requires extremely interdiciplinary skills from different specialties like biology, ecology, evolution, forestry, archeology, climatology.... the list goes on. A simple recognition of the necessity of restoration will help! </p>
<p>Restoration is just one way that we can become more sustainable - help MORE by recycling, driving less, buying local foods, and not polluting. </p>
<p>Every bit matters!</p>

This food does not provide me with any nutritional value, and then I go home and have to take a four hour nap induced by a sugar and calorie overload.</p>
<p>I have recently had the pleasure of learning about the indegenous tribes of America. It has been extremely helpful and inspiring to see how simple and harmonious their way of life was until we of course systematically wiped them out with disease, misunderstanding, and racial superiority.</p>

<p>It has become very clear to me that the first step is to make the self healthy and happy. And I am going to begin this journey by constructing a beautiful and expansive roof top garden right here in Boston. I have reached out to local farming experts and the Boston Gardener store and know that this is something completely within my reach.</p>
<p>Here is the catch: I currently am just skating by economically as a college student in Boston who still does not have a self sustainable source of food.</p>
<p>And I want to make this garden as huge, expansive, colorful, and absurdly unique as possible.</p>
<p>I have met with gardners who know how to set up advanced hydroponic systems that work in urban climates. This will probably be the bulk of the cost. I also am purchasing special seeds from a group in Brooklyn whose seeds are prime for urban climates.</p>

<p>I am also going to grow a ridiculous amount of flowers because I have always been sustained by natural color. The ability to sprout color from the ground on my own accord is nothing short of magical. It would also be great to have my own supply of flowers to give to friends for their artistic accomplishments and performances. In addition, strangers love when you give them flowers and I think this will bring my cityfolk more reasons to not look like they want to kill themselves on their way to work!</p>

<h2>Who are we?</h2>
<p>ASI Conserva Chile is the only association of private and indigenous nature reserves in Chile, and one of the rising nature conservation organizations in South America. We promote biodiversity conservation, sustainable development, and community integration among our association members, businesses, government entities, and society at large.</p>
<h2><strong>What are we doing?</strong></h2>
<p>This August, ASI Conserva Chile is co-hosting the 10th Latin American Congress of Private Nature and Indigenous Reserves in the beautiful Patagonia region of Chile. Traditionally, indigenous organizations and their leaders are absent from conservation discussions in Latin America, despite possessing a significant entitlement of private lands. We want to bring the indigenous community's voice into the conversation. At this Congress, speakers will present on a variety of conservation themes, among which are voluntary reserve financing, sustianable community tourism, and research for small-scale conservation efforts. This Congress, like so many in the past, will  revitalize and catalyze conversations about conservation awareness and development in all types of communities across Latin America.</p>
<p>To promote participation and dialogue among Latin America's indigenous groups, ASI Conserva Chile hopes to offer five (if not more!) full scholarships to prominent indigenous leaders to attend our conference.</p>

</div>
<div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>The Scholarship</h3>
<p>Each scholarship will include conference registration with food and lodging for the duration of the conference, a cost of approximately $850. With the extra $150, we will offer transportation stipends for each recipient.</p>
<p>Five participants, at $1000 each, totals $5000. Why the extra $500 for a campaign total of $5,500? Being a foreign-based organization, we frequently encounter many fees in transfering funds and coordinating purchases between the many countries represented in this Congress. To ensure that each of our scholarship recipients receive their full award, we are raising an additional $500 to account for such administrative costs and the Indiegogo campaign fees.</p>
<p>Any funds raised above the campaign goal will be utilized to supply additional scholarships. We have a list of at least 17 indigenous leaders that we would like to invite, so there is plenty of room for extra donations!</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>The Impact</h2>
<p>Private and indigenous land conservation is a largely unknown movement in Latin America, despite more than 1.6 million hectares of private land reserves in Chile alone. By supporting the participation of regional leaders in our conference, you expand the impact of our efforts and help bring our mission of environmental consciousness and sustainability to indigenous communities limited by financial or geographic obstacles</p>
<p>The primary objective of this year's congress is to exchange experiences that contribute to sustainable development based in ""Innovation for the Conservation of Biodiversity."" With this theme in mind, participants will determine how to strengthen  private-public partnerships that promote the rescue of our natural and cultural partimony, in a manner that sustains the wellbeing of society for future generations.</p>
<p>For quantitative examples of sustainable development objectives, here are a few goals that ASI Conserva Chile is working towards:</p>
<ul>
<li>Receive congressional support for a law allowing donations and tax incentives for environmental groups in Chile. Currently, no such law exists!</li>
<li>Create an online commerical plaftorm for selling products and services from private and indigenous naturea reserves, using the government organization CORFO as a primary sponsor.</li>
<li>Aument participation in ASI Conserva Chile's conservation network from 600,000 hectares to 900,000 hectares of protected land  by 2015.</li>
</ul>
<p>All conference sessions will be in Spanish. Due to the large number of presentations and sessions, and the small size of our team, most materials distributed will be solely in Spanish as well.</p>

solutions we need today to stop climate change?  </strong>We do.  Even better -
stopping climate change does not need to turn our lives upside down, it will actually create millions of U.S. jobs, significantly improve our health (imagine no more smog!) and
lower our energy bills significantly in the future.  Our mission is to raise awareness and empower people across the
U.S. with information on climate change solutions and what they can do to help
protect our future.  There are many
things that everyone can do to that will make a difference and help us make
this change in time.  Our App is a hub for information on specific actions everyone can take to help make this transition happen - from individual actions like buying or leasing an electric car and participating in your local green energy program to community actions like talking to your neighbors about the solutions to climate change and your city council about local policies that will help move us forward.  </p>
<p><b>Our App &amp; Online Community will be a place where everyone can:</b></p>
<p></p><p></p><ul>
<li>Find answers to their questions about climate change</li>
<li>Find out about the solutions to climate change and how we can do this - without turning our lives upside down.</li>
<li>Learn about the costs savings, health benefits and other positive effects from stopping climate change</li>
<li>Explore actions everyone can take to help move us forward and create a safe and healthy future - including complete information on how to do each action.</li>
<li>Connect with others to share ideas and resources and work together on goals.</li>
<li>Earn points, track your progress, join a team and see the impacts of your actions and your costs savings.  We include some fun friendly competition and recognition for actions.</li>
<li>All information provided based on U.S. and international established scientific sources like the U.S. National Academy of Sciences, EPA, NOAA and United Nations, IPCC and top research from Yale, Stanford, UC Berkeley and many other Universities.</li>
<li>Our App will help teachers, community volunteers and cities with their efforts to raise awareness on climate change solutions.</li>
</ul><p><b>This is the first App that provides all this information together in a user friendly format.
</b>100% of the funding we receive will go directly to developing and launching the
project.</p>
<p><b>There is no time to wait –
climate change is happening faster than predicted.</b>  We need to make a significant change in the next 10-15 years to
protect the future of our children in school today.<b>  </b>With our gridlocked Congress and the billions in profits the fossil fuel industry has to influence policy and try to stop this transition, we will not move forward unless people - like you and me - become aware of the solutions and begin to take action.</p>
<p>Contribute today and send this on to a friend - help us spread the word about
solutions and empower people with the tools and information they need to help
protect our future.  </p><p><strong>We can do this.  Together we can make an impact
and create a safe and healthy future.  Thank you!</strong></p><p><strong>All contributors will have the chance to participate in our beta test and provide input on our App!<br/></strong></p><p>Check out our <a href=""http://www.goco2free.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">project website</a> and learn more about our project!</p>
<h3>Fundraising Goals</h3>
<div>We have developed the basic App design, but need funding to build our App for launch.  We want to provide the latest information on climate solutions, easy to use tools to plan and track progress and clean graphics and clear videos to reach as many people as possible.  We also want to customize our App to each area with local information on impacts and solutions.  Our goal is to launch in early 2015.  </div><div><br/></div><div><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Your contribution will help us build our App &amp; Online Community for launch.  Our fundraising goals:</span></div>

If we hit at least $25,000 we will be able to start our build right away and make our deadline of a prototype by December!  (If we don't hit $25,000 we will still build our App, but delay a bit to do more fundraising first).  Please make a contribution today and forward on to a friend!  

New Perk:  If you contribute $50 or more or have 5 or more friends donate $10 or more we will send you a GO CO2 Free T-Shirt.  Just ask your friends to post a comment saying who referred them or email us at goco2free@gmail.com.  (This will apply to all donors since the beginning of the campaign)
New Perk #2:  We will send all contributors a certificate every year for 3 years after our launch saying how many tons CO2 our program users have avoided and how their contribution made this possible.
Beta Test:  Everyone who contributes will have the opportunity to be part of our beta test and help provide input on our program design!Website:  www.goco2free.orgWe are creating an App & Online Community to empower people with information on climate change solutions and what actions everyone can take to help create a safe and healthy future.Did you know we have all the technology and
solutions we need today to stop climate change?  We do.  Even better -
stopping climate change does not need to turn our lives upside down, it will actually create millions of U.S. jobs, significantly improve our health (imagine no more smog!) and
lower our energy bills significantly in the future.  Our mission is to raise awareness and empower people across the
U.S. with information on climate change solutions and what they can do to help
protect our future.  There are many
things that everyone can do to that will make a difference and help us make
this change in time.  Our App is a hub for information on specific actions everyone can take to help make this transition happen - from individual actions like buying or leasing an electric car and participating in your local green energy program to community actions like talking to your neighbors about the solutions to climate change and your city council about local policies that will help move us forward.  
Our App & Online Community will be a place where everyone can:

Find answers to their questions about climate change
Find out about the solutions to climate change and how we can do this - without turning our lives upside down.
Learn about the costs savings, health benefits and other positive effects from stopping climate change
Explore actions everyone can take to help move us forward and create a safe and healthy future - including complete information on how to do each action.
Connect with others to share ideas and resources and work together on goals.
Earn points, track your progress, join a team and see the impacts of your actions and your costs savings.  We include some fun friendly competition and recognition for actions.
All information provided based on U.S. and international established scientific sources like the U.S. National Academy of Sciences, EPA, NOAA and United Nations, IPCC and top research from Yale, Stanford, UC Berkeley and many other Universities.
Our App will help teachers, community volunteers and cities with their efforts to raise awareness on climate change solutions.
This is the first App that provides all this information together in a user friendly format.
100% of the funding we receive will go directly to developing and launching the
project.
There is no time to wait –
climate change is happening faster than predicted.  We need to make a significant change in the next 10-15 years to
protect the future of our children in school today.  With our gridlocked Congress and the billions in profits the fossil fuel industry has to influence policy and try to stop this transition, we will not move forward unless people - like you and me - become aware of the solutions and begin to take action.
Contribute today and send this on to a friend - help us spread the word about
solutions and empower people with the tools and information they need to help
protect our future.  We can do this.  Together we can make an impact
and create a safe and healthy future.  Thank you!All contributors will have the chance to participate in our beta test and provide input on our App!Check out our project website and learn more about our project!
Fundraising Goals
We have developed the basic App design, but need funding to build our App for launch.  We want to provide the latest information on climate solutions, easy to use tools to plan and track progress and clean graphics and clear videos to reach as many people as possible.  We also want to customize our App to each area with local information on impacts and solutions.  Our goal is to launch in early 2015.  Your contribution will help us build our App & Online Community for launch.  Our fundraising goals:

</div></div>","Pictured above just before bulldozers destroyed private property and the Blued Trees on it.  Nancy Vann, President of the landowners association that invited the Blued Trees overture performance, single handedly tries to hold back the bulldozers and chainsaws. Nine people were arrested last week trying to protect the land under the Blued Trees Overture from pipeline corporations because they know that fossil fuels and ""natural gas"" are destroying the earth. Spectra Energy, developer of the Algonquin Incremental Market (AIM) pipeline expansion, ignored our cease and desist notification issued to protect the copyrighted Blued Trees Overture, which had been lovingly and joyously painted during the 2015 Summer Solstice by 20 men, women and children. Now we need the funds to litigate for damages while protecting all the other sites in the path of natural gas pipelines.Other folks taking part in the Blued Trees project are at various stages of painting at nine sites around the nation. This fundraiser would help pay for the legal research to umbrella all the sites, protect them from unconscionable eminent domain takings, and the habitat from destruction at the hands of fossil fuel and natural gas profiteers.Blued Trees is on the frontlines, demanding that eminent domain be reserved for the public good, not private profit! Help hold off these environmental criminals!Our historic legal strategy aims to protect ALL the Blued Trees sites. We urgently need to raise $5,000 so our legal team can continue this new stage of its critical work before another site falls to their rapacious greed.The future of this unique, innovative legal challenge to corporate control of our communities depends on the commitment of people like you, who love nature and art. We really, really need you. Won’t you please give as generously as you possibly can, and help make history? Please donate, and share this appeal now with everyone you know who is aware that our fight for the planet is going to come down to something new and untried, because the same old stuff does not work when we’re fighting the most powerful, wealthy corporations and their captured policymakers!More information can be found by visiting the following links:http://westchester.news12.com/news/nancy-vann-of-cortlandt-manor-blocks-tree-removal-in-pipeline-controversy-1.11143447http://www.brooklynrail.org/2015/11/criticspage/blued-trees-on-the-front-lines-journal-excerpts

<h3>Writing Climate Change Back into History</h3>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Solutions to combat the threat of climate change are being undermined. </span>Every day, climate deniers spread half truths and minimize the knowledgeable dedication of climate conservationists who are acting responsibly in responding to the sense of failure that we are experiencing as we witness climate changes.  I've been working with Our Green Challenge for several years providing useful tips to concerned people who want to reduce their carbon footprint, save money and feel they are part of the solution. </p>
<p>With this project, we decided that it was time to write climate change back into history. Fundamentally, we’re concerned that students and the public are
getting the wrong media message. Essentially, students who pursue
ecology, environmental sciences, conservation, wildlife management or climatology
shouldn't be concerned that their compassion for the environment and actions to
conserve our natural resources be deemed cause for being maligned. Efforts toward the restoration of our climate are extremely relevant. </p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Our team will gather up to 1,000 biographies of conservationists from various sectors of society around the world. Teachers, community leaders, businesses,
scientists, writers, architects, inventors, government employees, builders,

We will also provide a handbook on how to help local climate role models get heard. More personalized accounts and local efforts will appear in a series of dispatches on a WordPress website and in an e-book as part of our “Writing Climate Change Back into History” project. Eventually, we will print a regional and global photographic and story essay. </span></p>

<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">This campaign will cover the first phase of this project: the collection of the narratives and the online effort of documenting contributions.  Throughout this phase, every donor will have the opportunity to be an integral part of recognizing these positive achievements as we set out to make them available to online communities. </span><br/></p>

<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Is the question of our time when it comes to climate change
really about environmentalism OR human well-being? No, we don't think so. This project will be
part of an ongoing attempt to work toward rejecting this false dichotomy and bridge a dialogue between those who are genuinely interested in conservation efforts and those who want to better understand their perspectives without having to subscribe to a cause. Our efforts will make available more accurate and real perspectives on conservation efforts to interested readers. You'll help shed some light on leading community members who are living examples. Our Green Challenge has successfully provided carbon footprint reduction tips to thousands of people in the Santa Rosa area and online through outreach efforts. We're reaching out to other groups who are also trying to empower people with ways we can help better serve our environment. You'll be an integral part of our growing effort!</p>

</p><h3><b>Introduction</b></h3>
<p>Hello,</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">I am Jordi Janssen, an MSc Forest and Nature conservation student at
Wageningen University in the Netherlands. During my last visit in New Zealand
(studying lizard rodent interactions) I came across a very important knowledge
gap in in the ecology of a very special lizard, Suter’s skink. I would like to
add that much needed knowledge and will spent my thesis research on this topic.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Suter’s skink is a unique lizard for New Zealand, not only is it the only
egg-laying lizard, it is completely restricted to the shores of the North
Island. There they occur close to the high tide mark on boulder beaches.
Suter’s skink populations suffered enormously from introduced rodents and their
range is reduced to &lt;10% of what is used to be. The presence of rodents
forced these skinks to find refuge in between the boulders to escape predation,
however this exposes them to the harsh environment of the salt water. However,
nobody knows how this skink is able to deal with the salt water and how large
the exposure actually is. I am planning to study exactly this, but therefore I
need your help.</p>
<h3><b>Why is this research important?</b></h3>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Suter’s skink distribution decreased extensively in the presence of
introduced rodents, with their current range representing &lt;10% of their former
range. Although the boulder beaches provide refuge to escape predation, they
are unstable and frequently inundate. The presence of these rodents forces
Suter’s kink to face the physiological challenges of the salt-water. 
However, it is completely unknown how this species is able to handle the
frequent exposure to salt water. </p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Lizards that occur near or on the shore is not that abnormal, with plenty
of species occurring near or on the shores.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">So what makes Suter’s skink different than most other lizards, Suter’s
skink, in contrast to other lizards occurring on the shore, actually enters the
water on a frequent basis. They can even hold their breath for up to 20
minutes! Other lizards occurring on the shores do not enter the water on a
frequent basis but rather just feed on the insects that wash ashore with the
seaweed. This could make Suter’s skink a unique lizard species, somewhere
between terrestrial and marine lizards.</p>
<h3><b>Goal</b></h3>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">My goal is to try to solve the question how Suter’s skink is able to
handle living in such a hard environment and hopefully add an important part of
knowledge of Suter’s skink’s ecology. </p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">I aim to do this by studying salt excretion, and it’s exposure to the
salt water by measuring foraging behaviour. I will study how much salt Suter’s skink
will ingest via its prey and how it excretes those salts using nasal and fecal
samples. To measure foraging behaviour I adapted a technique to document its
movement. Using a fluorescent gel we will be able to obtain detailed movement
patterns of this species. This way we can estimate how large Suter’s skink's exposure to salt-water is. Current plans set the field period at January till April 2014.</p>

Hello,
I am Jordi Janssen, an MSc Forest and Nature conservation student at
Wageningen University in the Netherlands. During my last visit in New Zealand
(studying lizard rodent interactions) I came across a very important knowledge
gap in in the ecology of a very special lizard, Suter’s skink. I would like to
add that much needed knowledge and will spent my thesis research on this topic.
Suter’s skink is a unique lizard for New Zealand, not only is it the only
egg-laying lizard, it is completely restricted to the shores of the North
Island. There they occur close to the high tide mark on boulder beaches.
Suter’s skink populations suffered enormously from introduced rodents and their
range is reduced to <10% of what is used to be. The presence of rodents
forced these skinks to find refuge in between the boulders to escape predation,
however this exposes them to the harsh environment of the salt water. However,
nobody knows how this skink is able to deal with the salt water and how large
the exposure actually is. I am planning to study exactly this, but therefore I
need your help.
Why is this research important?
Suter’s skink distribution decreased extensively in the presence of
introduced rodents, with their current range representing <10% of their former
range. Although the boulder beaches provide refuge to escape predation, they
are unstable and frequently inundate. The presence of these rodents forces
Suter’s kink to face the physiological challenges of the salt-water. 
However, it is completely unknown how this species is able to handle the
frequent exposure to salt water. 
Lizards that occur near or on the shore is not that abnormal, with plenty
of species occurring near or on the shores.
So what makes Suter’s skink different than most other lizards, Suter’s
skink, in contrast to other lizards occurring on the shore, actually enters the
water on a frequent basis. They can even hold their breath for up to 20
minutes! Other lizards occurring on the shores do not enter the water on a
frequent basis but rather just feed on the insects that wash ashore with the
seaweed. This could make Suter’s skink a unique lizard species, somewhere
between terrestrial and marine lizards.
Goal
My goal is to try to solve the question how Suter’s skink is able to
handle living in such a hard environment and hopefully add an important part of
knowledge of Suter’s skink’s ecology. 
I aim to do this by studying salt excretion, and it’s exposure to the
salt water by measuring foraging behaviour. I will study how much salt Suter’s skink

What I Need & What You Get
As I said before, I
cannot do this alone. Therefore I am asking for a small donation to help me
conduct this field research and add this important part on Suter’s skink
ecology. 
Your donation will allow me to travel to New
Zealand, to and from my study sites, find housing and/or pay for field
equipment and chemical analysis of samples. I will pay more than half of my
total research costs, but for the final 40% I need your help.

""Dr John Todd is a visionary, with an uncanny knack for ecology. He is as much artist as scientist, but his medium is biology."" —Donnella Meadows
Biomimicry South Africa is excited to announce a unique biomimicry expedition opportunity in Botswana's magnificent Okavango Delta!  Two great biomimics - Dr John Todd & Nancy Jack Todd will be visiting South Africa in October 2013 to contribute to a number of biomimicrySA's water cleaning projects.

<p>Emily Wilson - low-impact artivist, budding local foodie, photojournalist</p>
<p>We've both lived on occupied Cayuga land (so-called Ithaca, NY) for the past few years, and have been increasingly involved in its thriving local food community, as well as in the fight against hydro-fracking and other dangerous extractive processes of the fossil-fuel industry.</p>
<h3>What are we doing?</h3>
<p>This summer, we're traveling across the U.S., working on farms, taking lots of photos, and recording lots of conversations with the folks we meet, all centered around the theme of food resistance. Our ultimate goal is to create a photo book on American food resistance, available both online and in print. We're asking for your help in covering the cost of travel and the cost of creating the photo book.</p>
<h3>What is food resistance?</h3>
<p>When we say food resistance, we mean any practice that resists the dominant paradigm of food production and consumption. This includes:</p>
<p><strong>1. Sustainable agriculture:</strong> Growing and selling food locally and in a way that prioritizes the long-term health of the soil, the people, and the ecosystem as a whole.</p>
<p><strong>2. Food Justice:</strong> Getting healthy, nourishing food into the hands of those most marginalized by the industrial food system, notably low-income folks, indigenous folks, and people of color.</p>
<p><strong>3. Resistance to Extreme Energy:</strong> Resisting dangerous fossil-fuel extraction techniques, like hydro-fracking, mountain-top removal coal mining, and tar sands extraction. We oppose these techniques not only because of their implications for climate change, but also because they put the vitality of the land and human health at risk. Without clean water, clean air, and clean soil, we can't build a more sustainable and just food system.</p>
<h3>Why are we doing this?</h3>
<p>We believe that these three struggles, 1) the struggle to build a sustainable food economy, 2) the struggle to dismantle racism, classism, and colonialism in our food system, and 3) the struggle to smash the fossil fuel industry, are bound together, and that one cannot succeed without working in solidarity with the others. Our project is built around listening to individual stories of food resistance and weaving those stories together into a singular story of collective liberation. Our hope is that through this kind of story-telling, we can build a stronger and more inclusive movement. For folks already fighting, we hope to remind them that they are not alone. For folks still on the sidelines, we hope to help them join the fight.</p>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>Here's a breakdown of our estimated costs:</p>
<p><strong>1. Gas- $1,100</strong><br/>We're traveling in Emily's Prius, and we'll need gas to feed that robot beast. We're estimating our trip at around 8,500 miles, which should come to about $1,100 in gas. Check out our website, <a href=""http://facesoftheland.com/route"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://facesoftheland.com/route</a>, to see our tentative route. </p>
<p><strong>2. Food- $300</strong><br/>For much of the trip we'll be staying on farms, helping grow food in exchange for three hots and a cot, but in between farm stays, we need to eat. </p>
<p><strong>3. Photo Supplies- $1,600</strong><br/>Emily will be shooting some photos digitally, mostly for updates to the website. For the final publication, however, she will be shooting just over 30 rolls of 35 mm film, half in color and half in black and white. The film itself comes to $200. The costs of processing, scanning, and printing this film will depend on her access to a fully stocked darkroom (if anyone can help with this, please give us a shout!). Without such access, we estimate the cost of professional-grade processing and scanning services at $1,200. We're also budgeting $200 towards making and framing prints from the project. </p>
<p><strong>4. Publishing- $1,000</strong><br/>We're still investigating our options for publishing. Our plan as of now is to self-publish using Blurb, and hopefully submit our photo book to established publishers at a later date. We estimate the cost of printing through Blurb at around $100 per copy, including the shipping for donors who opt for a signed copy as a perk. Any funds beyond our stated goal will go towards pursuing publishing and/or printing additional copies of the book.</p>
<p><strong><strong>5. Fees- $400</strong><br/></strong>Best-case scenario, we make our funding goal and Indiegogo takes 4% in fees, then PayPal/our bank takes additional fees for money transfer. As we've budgeted pretty specifically, we are aiming to end up with the $4,000 goal. </p>
<h3>What You Get</h3>
<p>We have some awesome perks available as thank-you gifts for your contributions! Check out the list to the right, and let us know if you'd like something not specifically listed. We'll do our best to accommodate any special requests.</p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We have our itinerary planned out as far West as Utah, but we're always looking for more projects to check out. If you're growing food, working to fix the food system some other way, or fighting the fossil-fuel industry, drop us a line! We'd love to stop by, do some volunteer work, and connect your story to stories around the country. A roof to sleep under, a meal, or somewhere to pitch our tent is also much appreciated. </p>
<p>Also, spread the word to other folks who might be interested! You can use IndieGoGo's share tools, or post the link to your Facebook, Twitter, etc.</p>

<h3><strong>Welcome to our expedition!</strong></h3>
<div>
<p>We are a team of three very different guys, Nick from Canada, Edvin from Sweden and Morgan from the USA who have come together for a long awaited Arctic odyssey and would like to invite you along for the voyage.</p>
<p>As the polar icecap melts away due to climate change new waterways emerge into and through the Arctic. We are planning to sail across the Arctic from Atlantic to Pacific by one of these new routes to highlight the sad truth that makes this trip possible. </p>
<p>As important as this expedition is to us is it would be nothing if we couldn’t share it with all of you. On our <a href=""http://belzebub2.com/?lang=en"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">website</a> you can follow our journey through a series of <a href=""http://belzebub2.com/video-3?lang=en"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">video</a> blogs, regular updates telling the story of our trip (good, bad and embarrassing) and the dramatic effects climate change has had in the Arctic and pure adventure.

</div>
<div>
<p>Due to the extreme nature of the voyage, special equipment and provisions are mandatory for this long expedition through one of the most remote areas on the planet.</p>
<p>Having put every resource we have into this project we are so close to completing all the preparations but are still missing some key components such as:</p>
<br/><ul>
<li>The ability to upload and download data to our website straight from the boat since we will be isolated for months = lots of satellite phone minutes!</li>
<li>Cover our carbon offset so that we do not contribute to the melting Arctic while telling this story</li>
<li>Replace our broken radar so we can see icebergs in the fog, at night and sleep soundly.</li>
<li>Make final ice reinforcements so we won’t sink if we hit an iceberg</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>Every donation you make will go straight into making this expedition possible and making it available to all of you so we can highlight polar ice cap depletion through our voyage. If this campain is successful it will cover half of our budget.</p>

Welcome to our expedition!

We are a team of three very different guys, Nick from Canada, Edvin from Sweden and Morgan from the USA who have come together for a long awaited Arctic odyssey and would like to invite you along for the voyage.
As the polar icecap melts away due to climate change new waterways emerge into and through the Arctic. We are planning to sail across the Arctic from Atlantic to Pacific by one of these new routes to highlight the sad truth that makes this trip possible. 
As important as this expedition is to us is it would be nothing if we couldn’t share it with all of you. On our website you can follow our journey through a series of video blogs, regular updates telling the story of our trip (good, bad and embarrassing) and the dramatic effects climate change has had in the Arctic and pure adventure. You also have the chance to join us onboard if you take us up on our Arctic expedition perk.
Our small but trusty boat is not the average multimillion dollar expedition mega yacht but an environmentally friendly vehicle that we have spent years modifying to turn it into a safe vessel capable of this Arctic expedition.

Unfortunately we get FOUR doses of chemical exposure, more than any other people on the planet! </p><p>Our islands are the most isolated in the world. Like Jurassic Park, they have turned us into a “Test Site Sacrifice Zone” with a chance of containing whatever new life form they release that may go horribly wrong. </p><h3><b>The Problem</b></h3><p>In order to standardize their commercial seed supply, they literally sterilize the soil by flooding the fields with pesticides, mildicides, fungicides, and antibiotics. I<a href=""http://grist.org/business-technology/gmo-companies-are-dousing-hawaiian-island-with-toxic-pesticides/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">n their open-air laboratories they spray more than 80 different chemicals</a> in undocumented combinations, mixing in the field with unknown results. </p><p><a href=""http://www.fooddemocracynow.org/blog/2014/jul/1/stoop_monsanto_dows_toxic_gmo_chemical_cocktail"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">No one knows what dangers these chemical combinations or “Chemical Cocktails” present.</a> The EPA, which is supposed to be protecting us, admitted to us that they do not regulate nor require reporting on the combinations of chemicals that mix in sequential spraying on our fields. <br/></p><p>                                              <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/698759/files/20140707033830-child_stop_hurt.jpg?1404729510"" src="""" style=""width: 256.667px; height: 385px;""/><br/></p><h3><b>We get the poisons, they get the profits </b></h3><p>Over 80 different <a href=""http://mitpress.mit.edu/books/pesticide-drift-and-pursuit-environmental-justice"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">chemicals sprayed in the open fields here get carried by the winds</a> and heavy rains and flow into our water supply and our reefs – their poisons are leaving the fields and spreading everywhere! GMO production is destroying paradise and we need your help to stop them. </p><p>Just last January, the <a href=""https://www.indiegogo.com/project/preview/eha-web.doh.hawaii.gov/eha-cma/documents/7fb9412b-9b2f-401e-992a-92bf729b3159"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Hawaii Department of Health conducted a study</a> to establish a quick baseline of toxicity of the surface waters throughout the islands. They discovered that 100% of the 38 samples contained some form of chemical pesticides and herbicides. ALL OF THE SAMPLES WERE CONTAMINATED and they are doing nothing about it! So, we the people are.</p><p>Their pesticides have been found flowing through the tap water in our homes. Urine tests of local citizens are revealing the chemicals in our people. </p><p>Monsanto has not been doing enough to control wind blown dust and recently got fined a few thousand dollars for it. That was just a slap on the wrist, really just a PR stunt to pretend the regulators are watching.  </p><h3><b>The urgency is now</b></h3><p>We see everyday that people on our islands are getting sick with strange unexplained illnesses and cancers. One specific, horrible birth defect is occurring in Hawaii at a rate that’s 10 times higher than the national average.  Our situation is immediate and we urgently need your help.  <br/></p><h3><b>The SHAKA Solution: <br/>   Clean, Natural Farming Jobs and Food Sovereignty</b></h3><p>More than 90% of the food consumed in Hawaii today is shipped here. There’s only a three day food supply on the island. We are not equipped to feed ourselves if the shipments stop. </p><p>Up until 50 years ago, and for thousands of years before, Hawaiians were completely self sufficient, growing all their own food, living in perfect balance with the land. OUR VISION is to revitalize Maui County as the world’s greatest example of sustainability and self-sufficiency.</p><p>We have plans to remediate our soils and clean up the land. We have to begin sustainable agricultural practices immediately. We are close to passing the point where this can be done, so it is imperative to make the switch now.</p><p>It’s unfortunate the sensationalized fear of loss of jobs in the Ag sector will end up putting at risk the far larger Tourism economy.  As the people worldwide continue the current and growing trend to avoid GMO’s and pesticide exposure, Maui’s reputation as a center of holistic lifestyles and healthy vacationing will surely suffer.</p><p>There is absolutely no need for any loss of AG jobs because Monsanto and Mycogen can go back to growing conventional hybrid seed crops as they did preceding GMOs. Rising consumer rejection of GMO foods as well as the increasing number of countries banning GMOs is causing a decreased demand for GMO seeds and foods worldwide. At the same time, the world’s demand for safe conventional hybrid seeds is increasing. So this conversion is a logical choice for them.</p><p>SHAKA is looking forward to helping find and create alternative jobs for bio-tech workers who may want to transfer to healthier alternatives such as ecotourism and small farm sustainable agriculture. The same state and federal job programs that assisted workers when pineapple, sugar cane and even the Molokai Hotel shut down can be utilized if needed. <br/></p><p></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""326"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=%2F%2Fplayer.vimeo.com%2Fvideo%2F101899888&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fplayer.vimeo.com%2Fvideo%2F101899888&amp;image=http%3A%2F%2Fi.vimeocdn.com%2Fvideo%2F483781384_960.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=vimeo"" width=""580""></iframe></div><br/><p></p><h3><b>Sacred Hawaii is at risk</b></h3><p>Hawaii is a sacred place; the culture is rich and alive.

Monsanto has quietly turned the islands of Maui County into one of the largest open-air GMO and chemical test sites and genetically engineered seed factories in the world. Tragically, what they are doing here appears to be hurting our environment, our way of life, and our people. Federal and state regulations have all been manipulated to favor the Agro-Chemical Industry, so it’s up to us to stop them.The citizens of Maui County collected over 19,000 petition signatures to get a new law on our November’s election ballot for everyone to vote on.  We’ve called for a moratorium to stop the GMO and Chemical activities until they’re proven safe. The biotech companies are pushing back hard, spending millions on smear and disinformation campaigns. We need you to stand with us in unity to help not only ourselves, but everyone on the planet.Help save the planetMonsanto grows 80% of it’s poisonous BT Corn Seed right here and ships it to farmers all over the world. If you want to do something to stop GMO’s and their associated problems then please contribute to our campaign. By helping us close down the seed factories here, you’ll be helping everyone everywhere who understands that GMO’s and pesticide abuse is harming our planet.Grassroots at its bestSHAKA = Sustainable Hawaiian Agriculture for the Keiki and the 'AinaSHAKA Movement is a Hawaii tax-exempt, non-for-profit, grassroots, public service, educational 501(c)(3) organization committed to delivering to everyone in Maui County unbiased, factual information that is not controlled or manipulated by corporate interests. We intend to empower the citizens of Maui County to make a truly informed decisions. We encourage all Maui County residents to register to vote so that the people may determine their and their children’s future.  
Hawaii is perfect
Monsanto and Mycogen (Dow Chemical) have come to Maui County because our delightful, year-round climate gives them FOUR growing seasons to accelerate their tests and crop production. Unfortunately we get FOUR doses of chemical exposure, more than any other people on the planet! Our islands are the most isolated in the world. Like Jurassic Park, they have turned us into a “Test Site Sacrifice Zone” with a chance of containing whatever new life form they release that may go horribly wrong. The ProblemIn order to standardize their commercial seed supply, they literally sterilize the soil by flooding the fields with pesticides, mildicides, fungicides, and antibiotics. In their open-air laboratories they spray more than 80 different chemicals in undocumented combinations, mixing in the field with unknown results. No one knows what dangers these chemical combinations or “Chemical Cocktails” present. The EPA, which is supposed to be protecting us, admitted to us that they do not regulate nor require reporting on the combinations of chemicals that mix in sequential spraying on our fields.                                               We get the poisons, they get the profits Over 80 different chemicals sprayed in the open fields here get carried by the winds and heavy rains and flow into our water supply and our reefs – their poisons are leaving the fields and spreading everywhere! GMO production is destroying paradise and we need your help to stop them. Just last January, the Hawaii Department of Health conducted a study to establish a quick baseline of toxicity of the surface waters throughout the islands. They discovered that 100% of the 38 samples contained some form of chemical pesticides and herbicides. ALL OF THE SAMPLES WERE CONTAMINATED and they are doing nothing about it! So, we the people are.Their pesticides have been found flowing through the tap water in our homes. Urine tests of local citizens are revealing the chemicals in our people. Monsanto has not been doing enough to control wind blown dust and recently got fined a few thousand dollars for it. That was just a slap on the wrist, really just a PR stunt to pretend the regulators are watching.  The urgency is nowWe see everyday that people on our islands are getting sick with strange unexplained illnesses and cancers. One specific, horrible birth defect is occurring in Hawaii at a rate that’s 10 times higher than the national average.  Our situation is immediate and we urgently need your help.  The SHAKA Solution:    Clean, Natural Farming Jobs and Food SovereigntyMore than 90% of the food consumed in Hawaii today is shipped here. There’s only a three day food supply on the island. We are not equipped to feed ourselves if the shipments stop. Up until 50 years ago, and for thousands of years before, Hawaiians were completely self sufficient, growing all their own food, living in perfect balance with the land. OUR VISION is to revitalize Maui County as the world’s greatest example of sustainability and self-sufficiency.We have plans to remediate our soils and clean up the land. We have to begin sustainable agricultural practices immediately. We are close to passing the point where this can be done, so it is imperative to make the switch now.It’s unfortunate the sensationalized fear of loss of jobs in the Ag sector will end up putting at risk the far larger Tourism economy.  As the people worldwide continue the current and growing trend to avoid GMO’s and pesticide exposure, Maui’s reputation as a center of holistic lifestyles and healthy vacationing will surely suffer.There is absolutely no need for any loss of AG jobs because Monsanto and Mycogen can go back to growing conventional hybrid seed crops as they did preceding GMOs. Rising consumer rejection of GMO foods as well as the increasing number of countries banning GMOs is causing a decreased demand for GMO seeds and foods worldwide. At the same time, the world’s demand for safe conventional hybrid seeds is increasing. So this conversion is a logical choice for them.SHAKA is looking forward to helping find and create alternative jobs for bio-tech workers who may want to transfer to healthier alternatives such as ecotourism and small farm sustainable agriculture. The same state and federal job programs that assisted workers when pineapple, sugar cane and even the Molokai Hotel shut down can be utilized if needed. Sacred Hawaii is at riskHawaii is a sacred place; the culture is rich and alive. There is a spirit here that we call Mana, or “life force” that flows to those who live here and those lucky enough to visit.We have one of the most unique ecosystems filled with precious and delicate plant, animal, and oceanic life.  The damage done by these companies may be irreversible. That’s why we must act now.  Studies from around the globe are proving how dangerous these pesticide “cocktails” are.  It is deemed “unethical” to test pesticides on humans. Yet, that is exactly what is happening here. We are guinea pigs in their chemical test site.A Call to ActionDonate what you can, and SPREAD THE WORD to everyone you know that Maui is in trouble and needs your help.  Mahalo Nui Loa from all of us here fighting for the Keiki, the ‘Aina, and the world. Doing what is Pono (balanced).

<span>Die Reaktorkatastrophe von Fukushima hat den Journalisten und Filmemacher Ralph T. Niemeyer nicht </span>nur aus tagesaktuellem Anlaß interessiert, sondern auch in seiner Funktion als Wasseraktivist. Bereits im Jahr 2011 wenige Monate nach der Katastrophe von Fukushima Daiichi recherchierte Niemeyer die Problematik mit dem Kühlwasser und der entsprechenden radioaktiven Verseuchung. Ein Problem welches dem Filmemacher, der an einigen Projekten in der UdSSR mitgearbeitet hatte, seit Chernobyl bekannt vorkam. Seinerzeit hatte Niemeyer jene Wissenschaftler interviewt, die an der Reinigung des Wassers des Prypyat-Flusses bei Chernobyl beteiligt waren. Die Erfahrungen von 1986 ließen Niemeyer zum Anti-Atom und Pro-Wasser-Aktivisten werden. </p>
<p>
	Zur Zeit der japanischen Reaktorkatastrophe von Fukushima am 11. März 2011 lebte und arbeitete Niemeyer gerade seit drei Jahren in Moskau mit der Firma Radiy, die unter anderem für die früher als MIR bekannte russische Internationale Raumstation ISS Reinstwasserfiltrationssystem herstellt mit jenen Wissenschaftlern aus der Zeit von Chernobyl an der Entwicklung eines Umkehrosmoseverfahrens, welches Schwermetalle, Arsene, Nitrate aber auch radioaktive Substanzen wie Caesium 134 &amp; 137, Strontium, Jod und Tritium zu 99% herausfiltert und dabei keine Chemie benötigt. Durch ein Mineral aus dem Kaukasus ist es mit dieser Technologie möglich Wasser derartig selektiv zu reinigen, daß die gewünschten Mineralien weiterhin enthalten sind, alle schädlichen Stoffe aber eliminiert werden. Tests am Vernadsky Institut in Moskau aber auch am Bundesamt für Strahlenschutz in Berlin haben dies zweifelsfrei bestätigt. </p>
<p>
	Als Journalist nutzte Niemeyer sodann seine Möglichkeiten mit politischen Entscheidungsträgern in Kontakt zu treten, zunächst logischerweise in Japan, wo er glaubte offene Türen einzurennen angesichts der täglich sich verschlimmernden Lage in Fukushima, wo das Kühlwasser ein immer größeres Problem darstellte. Die Minister waren jedoch alles andere als zugänglih, ebenso die TEPCO Manager. Höflich aber bestimmt wurde jedes Hilfsangebot abgewiesen. Angeblich hätte Toshiba einen Filter, doch wie sich herausstellte,kann dieser nur ein millionstel Teilchen herausfiltern, die Russische Technologie hingegen ein zehnmillionstel Teilchen. Die Tatsache, daß die Japaner, obwohl derartig in Bedrägnis ausländische Hilfe abweisen würden machte den Journalisten stutzig. Eine Sache der Kultur, des Stolzes? Nein, es mußteeinen anderen Grund geben. Im Zuge seiner Recherchen für den Film ""Hibakusha"", in dem auch der Frage nachgegangen wurde, wieso eine Bevölkerung derartig technikgläubig zu sein vermochte, wenn die <span>Atombombenabwürfe doch noch im kollektiven Bewußtsein sind, fand Niemeyer heraus, daß zu keinem </span>Zeitpunkt der vergangenen Jahrzehnte Japan auf Atomstrom angewiesen wäre. Dies wurde durch Japanische Wissenschaftler zweifelsfrei belegt. </p>
<p>
	Man muß kein Verrschwörungstheoretiker sein, um den einzigen logischen Schluß zu ziehen: die Japanische Regierung und die Energiekonzerne sind derartig <span>zurückhaltend gegenüber ausländischen Hilfsangeboten, weil sie befürchten müssen, daß die Experten </span>aus anderen Nationen sich einen kompletten Überblick in Fukushima verschaffen würden und dabei<span>vermutlich herausfinden würden, was der Grund dafür ist, daß eine Nation, die zwei Atombombenabwürfe </span>erleben mußte, so vehement auf diese Technologie setzt. Nicht der wahnsinnig hohe Energiebedarf, der, <span>wie eine regierungsamtliche Studie aus dem Jahre 2000 belegt, längst mithilfe von alternativen </span>Energieerzeugungsmechanismen abgedeckt werden könnte, so vermutete Niemeyer war für die so genannte friedliche Nutzung der Kernkraft ausschlaggebend, sondern vielmehr die Tatsache, daß ein schneller Brüter in Fukui im Süden des Landes und eine Wiederaufarbeitungsanlage im Norden den kompletten nuklearen Zyklus ermöglicht und die 54 Reaktoren für die entsprechende Grundlage der <span>militärischen Nutzung liefern. Kurz: Japan hält an der Nutzung der Kernkraft aus einem einzigen Grund fest</span>: Japan wolle die Atombombe, so Niemeyer, der auch den Japanischen Premierminister Shenzo Abe <span>befragt hatte, von diesem aber nur sehr ausweichende Antworten bekommen hatte. Zurück in Moskau </span>sprach Niemeyer mit Außenminister Lawrow über das Hilfsangebot an Japan und dieser versprach sich <span>darum zu kümmern, allerdings gäbe es weder einen Friedensvertrag zwischen den Ländern noch sonstige </span>Kooperationsabkommen. Im Herbst 2013 wurde schließlich berichtet, daß Lawrow und sein japanischer <span>Amtskollege eine militärische Kooperation vereinbart hätten. Zeitgleich wurde eine internationale </span>Ausschreibung für die Lösung des Problemes der Wasserkontamination in Fukushima in die Wege geleitet. Niemeyer nahm daran mit seinen Kollegen ebenso wie 779 weitere Unternehmen aus aller Welt teil. Nun kamen diese Woche die Russischen Vorschläge in die engere Wahl und Niemeyer meldete das Patent für die kombinierte Technologie beim Europäischen Patentamt in München an. Man sollte nun dennoch nicht glauben, daß mit einer solchen Ausschreibung, selbst wenn diese den Zuschlag bedeuten sollte, wenigstens die Kosten für Reise und Transport der Technik von seiten der Japanischen Regierung,<span>die ihrerseits den Konzern Mitsubishi mit der Abwicklung beauftragt hat, getragen würden. Nein, auf Seite </span>8 der regierungsamtlichen Ausschreibung heißt es, daß die Kosten erst rückwirkend bei Beendigung des Projektes erstattet würden. Es wird also den Bewerbern nicht nur ein finanzielles Risiko aufgebürdet, sondern noch nicht einmal sichergestellt, daß sie nicht auf den entstehenden Kosten sitzenbleiben werden. Der Eindruck drängt sich auf, daß man in Japan sich noch immer nicht dazu durchgerungen hat, endlich ausländische Hilfe in Anspruch zu nehmen. Erst am 20. Mai 2014, mehr als drei Jahre nach dem Reaktorunglück von Fukushima kam Bewegung in die Sache. Eine Filtrationsanlage ist ausgefallen und nun drohen wieder 400 Tonnen kontaminiertes Wasser pro Tag in den Pazifik zu fließen, wie auch deutsche Medien berichteten. Sofort bekam Niemeyer eMails von der Japanischen Regierung und <span>Mitsubishi, die nun zur Vorführung der russischen Technologie einladen. Die Kosten dürfen aber nach wie </span>vor selber getragen werden. Es werden nun Spenden gesammelt, um die Reisekosten für die Experten zu <span>tragen und den Transport der Technik. Die Prioritäten werden in der Geschichte der Menschheit immer </span>wieder falsch gesetzt, sagt Niemeyer, der sich auch in Argentinien und Südafrika für soziale Wasserprojekte einsetzt. ""Für Fußball geben wir Milliarden aus, aber mit unserem wichtigsten Gut, dem Wasser, das nicht durch andere Stoffe ersetzt werden kann, gehen wir um, als hätten wir einen zweiten blauen Planeten in der Tasche.""

We have already built and tested a working prototype of Renegade and its accessories. We’ve also completed testing on a powerful new extruder which enables recycling of household plastics for 3D printing. At present we are ready to finalise production tooling and assemble the list of suppliers and manufacturers with which we will begin full production.</p><p>To avoid potential risks we have developed an appropriate risk evaluation and quality control program. However, as with any project, there are challenges to success and there is always the possibility of delays. Sometimes, due to factors outside of developer's control, such as supply chain performance, product certification, and the shipping process.</p><p>With your support, we can bring Renegade’s green 3D printing solution to the world. While we're close to entering production, your contribution will help fund critical stages in our immediate future such as production tooling, large component manufacturing, and obtaining FCC and CE certification.</p><h2>FAQ</h2><p><strong>Q:</strong> I want more than one Renegade product, what do I need to do?<br/><strong>A: </strong>Just pledge the appropriate amount, for the number of products you would like and send us a note. If you would like to order ten or more Renegade sets, contact us directly as we can offer discounts.</p><p><strong>Q:</strong> Does Renegade come with a warranty?<br/><strong>A:</strong> Yes, we're happy to announce that Renegade comes with a one year limited warranty.</p><p><strong>Q: </strong>How can I make long plastic tape for 3D printing from several short strips?<br/><strong>A: </strong>You can easily join them together by using glue, an iron, or a plastic bag sealer.</p><p><strong>Q:</strong> What are Renegade's technical specifications?<br/><strong>A:</strong> Weight: 110g<br/>Dimensions: D= 32mm, L= 195mm<br/>Working Temperature: adjustable, from 50°C up to 320°C <br/>Warm-up Period: 25-40 seconds <br/>Nozzle Diameter: 0.6mm <br/>Number of Speeds: 3 (slow+fast+reverse) <br/>Power Supply: 110-240V</p><p>*some parameters may vary slightly</p><p><strong>Q:</strong> I'm worried I won't be able to find all the colours I need for my 3D art!</p><p><strong>A: </strong>Remember, you're not just limited to plastic bottles! You can recycle used plastic bags and files as well. If you can't find the right shade you're looking for, or if perhaps you don't consume much plastic in your day to day life (good for you!) then we have an environmentally friendly solution waiting for you.</p><p>We will be providing 3D bottle strips ready for use with Renegade. You'll be able to buy a spool of 500 grams (305m/1000ft) for just £15 or $20. This means you get to feel good about helping the environment while saving more than 5 times in comparison with industry leading competitors. You can find more info on this and other extras above!</p><p><strong>Q:</strong> Is Renegade safe in my home or office?<br/><strong>A:</strong> Yes, we have done our research and the use of PET bottles and PE bags is identical to the use of preexisting standard PET, Polyethylene, or Polylactic acid (PLA) filaments so there won't be any bad fumes in your home or office. You're safe with Renegade.</p><p><strong>Q:</strong> What about plastic bottles with ridges or bumps?<br/><strong>A:</strong> Most ridges are easily eliminated by heating the bottle for 1 to 2 minutes. During the heating process the plastic gets slightly softer and the internal pressure (as the cap should remain closed) straightens and rectifies the bottle's surface, automatically eliminating ridges.</p><p>You'll be able to see this process performed on a ridged bottle by a heat gun on this video:</p><p><a href=""https://vimeo.com/174646222"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://vimeo.com/174646222</a></p><p>Please feel free to perform this test with your stove on low heat and any bottle. In a couple of minutes you will see that your bottle will be smooth and ready for cutting.</p><p><strong>Q:</strong> I have heard that 3D pens emit a bad odour, will this happen with Renegade?<br/><strong>A:</strong> The main cause behind the odour issues others are experiencing with 3D pens is the type of filaments used. ABS is the biggest problem. When you’re using a plastic bottle with Renegade, it’s just like you’re using a standard PET (Polyethylene Terephthalate) filament, likewise, when you’re using a plastic file, it’s exactly as if you’re using a regular PP (Polypropylene) filament. There are no odour issues with either of these; we performed over 100 tests. The only time we experienced any odour at all was when using ABS filaments.</p><p><strong>Q:</strong> Will Renegade come with a plug to fit my country's sockets?<br/><strong>A:</strong> Yes, you will be able to use Renegade in any region with both 110V and 240V voltage. We’ll send out a survey at the end of the campaign, where you’ll be asked to choose the plug type that suits your country’s electrical sockets.</p><p><strong>Q:</strong> Will the Renegade PRO work with my 3D printer?<br/><strong>A:</strong> The main requisite for using the Renegade PRO as a 3D Printer Head is the available space for the pen’s installation. There needs to be sufficient space over the printing head so that the pen does not collide with the top of your 3D printer as it operates. As we’ve mentioned, we are working on a 3D printer that will be powered by the same green technology. Our main partner in this endeavour has tested Renegade’s capabilities as a 3D printer head replacement on Prusa and delta style printers like Kossel. If you have any doubts, send us a direct message.</p></div>","Renegade's StoryWe often use 3D printing for our projects and one day we finally got fed up with highly overpriced filaments.

At present we are ready to finalise production tooling and assemble the list of suppliers and manufacturers with which we will begin full production.To avoid potential risks we have developed an appropriate risk evaluation and quality control program. However, as with any project, there are challenges to success and there is always the possibility of delays. Sometimes, due to factors outside of developer's control, such as supply chain performance, product certification, and the shipping process.With your support, we can bring Renegade’s green 3D printing solution to the world. While we're close to entering production, your contribution will help fund critical stages in our immediate future such as production tooling, large component manufacturing, and obtaining FCC and CE certification.FAQQ: I want more than one Renegade product, what do I need to do?A: Just pledge the appropriate amount, for the number of products you would like and send us a note. If you would like to order ten or more Renegade sets, contact us directly as we can offer discounts.Q: Does Renegade come with a warranty?A: Yes, we're happy to announce that Renegade comes with a one year limited warranty.Q: How can I make long plastic tape for 3D printing from several short strips?A: You can easily join them together by using glue, an iron, or a plastic bag sealer.Q: What are Renegade's technical specifications?A: Weight: 110gDimensions: D= 32mm, L= 195mmWorking Temperature: adjustable, from 50°C up to 320°C Warm-up Period: 25-40 seconds Nozzle Diameter: 0.6mm Number of Speeds: 3 (slow+fast+reverse) Power Supply: 110-240V*some parameters may vary slightlyQ: I'm worried I won't be able to find all the colours I need for my 3D art!A: Remember, you're not just limited to plastic bottles! You can recycle used plastic bags and files as well. If you can't find the right shade you're looking for, or if perhaps you don't consume much plastic in your day to day life (good for you!) then we have an environmentally friendly solution waiting for you.We will be providing 3D bottle strips ready for use with Renegade. You'll be able to buy a spool of 500 grams (305m/1000ft) for just £15 or $20. This means you get to feel good about helping the environment while saving more than 5 times in comparison with industry leading competitors. You can find more info on this and other extras above!Q: Is Renegade safe in my home or office?A: Yes, we have done our research and the use of PET bottles and PE bags is identical to the use of preexisting standard PET, Polyethylene, or Polylactic acid (PLA) filaments so there won't be any bad fumes in your home or office. You're safe with Renegade.Q: What about plastic bottles with ridges or bumps?A: Most ridges are easily eliminated by heating the bottle for 1 to 2 minutes. During the heating process the plastic gets slightly softer and the internal pressure (as the cap should remain closed) straightens and rectifies the bottle's surface, automatically eliminating ridges.You'll be able to see this process performed on a ridged bottle by a heat gun on this video:https://vimeo.com/174646222Please feel free to perform this test with your stove on low heat and any bottle. In a couple of minutes you will see that your bottle will be smooth and ready for cutting.Q: I have heard that 3D pens emit a bad odour, will this happen with Renegade?A: The main cause behind the odour issues others are experiencing with 3D pens is the type of filaments used. ABS is the biggest problem. When you’re using a plastic bottle with Renegade, it’s just like you’re using a standard PET (Polyethylene Terephthalate) filament, likewise, when you’re using a plastic file, it’s exactly as if you’re using a regular PP (Polypropylene) filament. There are no odour issues with either of these; we performed over 100 tests. The only time we experienced any odour at all was when using ABS filaments.Q: Will Renegade come with a plug to fit my country's sockets?A: Yes, you will be able to use Renegade in any region with both 110V and 240V voltage. We’ll send out a survey at the end of the campaign, where you’ll be asked to choose the plug type that suits your country’s electrical sockets.Q: Will the Renegade PRO work with my 3D printer?A: The main requisite for using the Renegade PRO as a 3D Printer Head is the available space for the pen’s installation. There needs to be sufficient space over the printing head so that the pen does not collide with the top of your 3D printer as it operates. As we’ve mentioned, we are working on a 3D printer that will be powered by the same green technology. Our main partner in this endeavour has tested Renegade’s capabilities as a 3D printer head replacement on Prusa and delta style printers like Kossel. If you have any doubts, send us a direct message.",17.0,8,"1 Campaign

<p>We are a group of artists, performers, and eco-pirates from around the world, who have connected with each other through the global Burning Man community.  We are passionate about the environment, community organising, and creative outreach.</p>
<p>We want to connect with local communities in Europe to show people how waste is affecting our waterways and oceans.  To do this we will build a fleet of floating art pieces, essentially rafts made from anything we find discarded by society.</p>
<p>Contributing to this campaign will help us get started with our first summer journey, down the Rio Ebro in Spain.  Your contributions will go towards transport, building space and some crew costs such as safety/communications equipment.</p>
<p>Peoples awareness about the state of our oceans is currently growing and we are not the only group trying to raise awareness about the issues.  Helping us play our small part in the waterways of Europe, will mean another group of change-makers in the world trying to stop the tidal wave of environmental destruction. </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>Working with local artist communities in and around Barcelona, we have found building space to rent at very reasonable costs where the crew can also live and participate in communtiy activities in exchange for their hospitatlity.  Cost for build space will be 200 euro for 2 months and each crew member will cost 100 euro for 2 months.  We are hoping to have a build crew of 10 so that would be a total of 1200 euro for build site and crew housing.  </p>
<p>Our other costs will come from fuel, tools, saftey equipment, communication and building materials.  We are estimating these initial costs for the first two months to be 1800 euros.  The principle of our project relies on found objects from the surronding communities and businesses for most of our building materials.  We hope not to purchase anything new for the actual building of the rafts, but rather buy new, proper saftey equipment like life vests, radios, fire extinguishers etc.  To ensure the crews saftey we will also be needing proper tools to make sound structures ( ie welding rods, drill bits, fixings such as srews and bolts, ropes).  During the build we will also need to preserve and prepare as much food as we can to keep costs down during the voyage so canning jars and food storage will need to be bought if not found.  In order to transport all of these found materials to our build site, fuel for our vehicles will also be necessary.  It is difficult to calculate exact costs, but we will economize all donations received and spend them only on our Junk Raft Armada.  We hope to prove that approximately 20 people can make an adventure with a mountain of trash from the Barcelona area and with a little help from all of you!  </p>
<p>For all the donations we recieve, we will send you hand made junk-crafts!  Every item will be unique and made from materials we find during our treasure finding dumpster dives and materials we save to upcycle.  Artists will be working on a range of products you can choose from such as Junk Raft Armada logo patchs and pins, upcycled jewelry pieces, home decor, garden decor and costume accesories.  All gifts will be gender non-specific.  </p>

<p>Our first trip will set the bar for future Junk Raft Armada voyages.  We don't want to stop here but embark every year on a new journey, inviting a new group of salty dogs to step aboard and experience alternative living.  Several crew members, such as Anthony Hiron and Abigail Pedersen, hope to continue on board the rafts, learning more about sustainable living to spread their interest in permaculture, raft building, and earth ships.  The crew consists of many hard working and creative souls.  To learn more about the crew memebers and all of our inspirations please visit the link below: </p>

Why your supports are needed

  One of the most dreadful catastrophe for modern society is water pollution with radioactive poisons, which causes the increases of gene abnormalities and cancers.
Conventional separation technologies (e.g., chemical precipitation or ion-exchange) can remove radioactive nuclides such as 137Cs, 90Sr, 144Ce, 106Ru, and 95Zr from  effluents produced at atomic power plants.

However, there are no effective conventional methods for separating tritium (T) forming a water molecule (HTO) from huge volume of water (H2O) at room temperature due to the similarity of physicochemical properties between HTO and H2O. Even if mass concentration of T in water is an extremely low level (e.g., nano grams per liter), its radioactive concentration of T corresponds to a level of million-becquerels (Bq) per liter (L). The EU standard vale of T for drinking water is 100 Bq/L.
  At present, radioactive effluents containing T are drained to the ocean from over 400 of atomic power plants in the world. However, the post-accident Fukushima atomic power plant (PAFAP) is currently producing T-containing effluents that have radioactive concentrations of 1000000 ~ 5000000Bq/L. This concentration is 10 ~ 50 thousandfold higher than the EU standard value for drinking water. Over 600000 tons of the T-containing effluents had already been haphazardly stored in tanks built beside the seacoast up to now. 

Before the serious accident, Fukushima atomic power plant had drained about 2 trillion Bq of T per one year within the regulation (3700 billion Bq/year) to the ocean with the normal operation of the power plant. Since the accident, over 900 trillion Bq of T produced from the accident reactors is being stored in tanks by April 2015. This quantity of T in tanks is equivalent to the quantity of T from the normal plant operation for 450 years! Japanese government is planning to dilute the effluent and drain it into the Pacific Ocean. Can you accept the releasing such huge volume of effluents containing T to the ocean?

Moreover, the production of effluent from the PAFAP has been forecast to continue for at least 20-30 years, until the finish of the operation for collecting meltdown  fuels. Therefore, the effluents produced in future must be treated for maintaining the safe quality of seawater.

  The final goal of our research project is the development of a pilot system for treating actual effluents containing T through collaborations with potential universities and industries, to solve this serious problem. 


By your support to this campaign, we can develop a system for extracting T from water and can make constructive collaborations with potential universities and industries in the world. From autumn 2013, we have been continuing this research project without any financial supports in Japan.



What is the major risk of tritium










We must minimize tritium contamination for drinking water or food, by removing tritium from radioactive effluents at atomic power plants, before releasing the effluents to the river or ocean.





Tritium diffuses easily in the seawater because tritium does not form precipitation in seawater unlike other radioactive nuclides. Accordingly, tritium water (HTO) released to the ocean and river, behaves as water (H2O) to evaporate and to circulate in our environment.

Especially, the worst scenario regarding the spreading of contaminated waters from Fukushima over the next decade was reported by German oceanographers, on Environmental Research Letters, 7. Their simulation showed the radioactive water from Fukushima could reach the US West Coast in the next 5–6 years.

How to remove tritium from water in our strategy


We recently found a novel function of a manganese oxide for absorbing T in water at room temperature.
Thus, this method provides a major breakthrough in the separation technology for extracting T from water. The product package and the electron-micrograph are shown below. 




By adding this manganese oxide powder to a test water containing T at room temperature, the radioactive concentration of T in the test water showed a remarkable decrease of 2.74 million Bq/L during the first 30 min on the reaction time as shown below. However, a subsequent increase after a minimum concentration
was reached on the curve.

Accordingly, using a flow-type liquid scintillation system to perform in-situ measurements for monitoring the changes in the radioactive concentration of T is
necessary. The system can indicate the correct timing for separating the absorbent from
the treated water before reaching the saturation of the T extraction.


This research result is currently in production by Taylor & Francis publisher,  as an original article on a journal, Separation Science and Technology.  The doi of the paper is http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01496395.2015.1018440.




As the next step, we are now developing and testing a membrane electrode made from the powdered manganese oxide absorbent, for decreasing the subsequent increase of the radioactive concentration of T.

By connecting the membrane electrode to the ground, decreasing the dissolution of Mn from the absorbent was confirmed. Moreover, a novel mechanism for extracting T from water by the absorbent is proposed as shown below.





What is the role of Indiegogo


  We would like to remarkably progress the phase 2, using the fund donated from this campaign. The achievement of subjects in the phase 2 is expected within 12 months from the May 2015. At the same time, several international collaborations should be constructed for early starting the phase 3.

Gardens bring visitors close to plants and to all of nature, which benefits them mentally, spiritually and physically.

Visiting gardens is a gateway experience to taking up gardening at home and in the community.
Public gardens are the primary teaching facilities for turning residents into gardeners, with classes and workshops on growing food, providing for wildlife, protecting our waterways from polluting run-off, and creating beauty in our home gardens or balconies.
Turning people on to gardening results in more beauty for all of us to enjoy and better stewardship of our land - without nagging.





How the Money Will be Used  



$25,000 will fund DC Gardens for all of 2015, our ""demonstration year."" Results from 2015 will attract long-term sponsors so that the DC Gardens is self-sustaining.  


Most of the funds ($18,000) will be used to hire a digital communications expert (Washington Gardener Magazine editor and social media whiz Kathy Jentz) to regularly get the word out to general, travel and gardening audiences locally, nationally and internationally.

Monthly Updates will include major garden-related events in our region and images showing what the gardens will look like in the coming month.
Our other demonstration-year expenses are graphic design and web design services.
If we don't reach our goal, the campaign will still begin in March of 2015 but may not find long-term sponsors before the funds run out.
If more than $25,000 is raised, we can do more, as ideas arise. Examples include in-garden events, helping to bring national garden writers to D.C. to spread the word, printing, etc. 
Indiegogo will keep 4% if we meet our goal, 9% if we don't.



Impacts



More visitors and residents will discover and enjoy the benefits of visiting our beautiful gardens.  

More visitors will learn to garden - in their own yard or in the neighborhood. New gardeners benefit physically and mentally, and neighborhoods become more beautiful. 
More plants will be grown that provide for pollinators and birds. Stormwater runoff will be reduced and the Chesapeake Bay will be healthier.

Visitors to DC will stay longer to see our gardens. More business visitors will bring their gardening spouses with them. As our gardens become better known, more people will come to Washington, D.C.  Good for business!

The Public Garden Association and the Garden Tourism Conference will be spreading the word about what DC is doing to promote gardens and gardening. Other cities will learn what works well and cost-efficiently to increase garden visitorship and turn residents into gardeners.

Garden writers and photographers in other cities will be hired to customize for their city what DC Gardens is doing. 

The gardens that need more public support just to stay open and keep the plants alive will get the support they need.

How DC Gardens.com Started



Prof. Richard Benfield gave an inspiring talk in DC about the value of gardens for tourism, which led to some local gardens brainstorming about a collective marketing campaign.  Garden blogger and volunteer Susan Harris was in on the brainstorming and began photographing gardens several times a month, through November. More photographers have joined the cause and their garden shots will be added to DC Gardens in 2015.

The Deschutes!</b></p>
<p>The once healthy and vital Deschutes estuary is now a public
and environmental health hazard known as Capitol Lake. Recreational access is closed
until the area is restored, and the water is of poor quality and full of invasive species - unhealthy for people
and wildlife. </p>
<p>But
it doesn't have to stay that way. By removing Olympia's 5th Avenue dam (constructed in 1951) and restoring
the southernmost tip of Puget Sound, we can bring this place back to life.
Removing the dam is the first step towards replacing the stagnant ""lake"" next to
downtown Olympia with a vibrant, healthy ecosystem. It will create jobs in the
restoration field, open public recreation access, and return the beauty of the marine water environment -  Puget Sound's natural place.</p>
<p>The
Deschutes Estuary Restoration Team (DERT) has been the only group bold enough
to take on the work to restore the mouth of the Deschutes River. Since 2009, we
have given the estuary a voice at public meetings and advisory groups,
and raised awareness in the community through outreach and education with
regular newsletters, media and events. We have covered a lot of ground in the
past five years, and we need your help to carry and build the momentum.</p>

<p><b>The
Impact</b></p>
<p>One of our biggest challenges is that
many people do not understand the benefits of a healthy, functioning estuary. Some do not know what an estuary is.  And, others can’t visualize what the estuary will look like.  DERT has been working
on a program called ‘Imagine the Deschutes Estuary,’ where we are helping people
visualize an urban estuary and its social, economic and ecological landscape. We have been working
with various artists (as demonstrated in our video) to create imagery of the
estuary. What animals will we see? What will the tides looks like? Where are
the people? Walking, kayaking, fishing, watching? Working as a scientist, laborer, or
educator?</p>
<p>Last year, DERT received a grant from
the Rose Foundation to develop advocacy programs and recruit volunteers.  These funds have helped us create a stronger presence in the community.  We just received another grant and we are using it to build our capacity. Just imagine how much
more impact we will have with more opportunities to reach out to people. We are
also focused on long-term strategic goals that ensure the livelihood of our
nonprofit organization.<span>  This includes bringing in additional funds - Indiegogo is our first attempt at an on-line fundraising effort!<br/></span></p>

<h3><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">English explanation is below. </span></h3>
<h3><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">Amaç</span></h3>
<p>Soma'da tam 6000 ağaç Termik Santral yapılması için kesildi. Danıştay iş işten geçtikten sonra yürütmeyi durdurdu. Şimdi orası boş. Tam 6000 ağaç yok yere gitti! Gelin birlik olup zaten maden kazasında yeterince zarar görmüş Soma'nın yok yere gitmiş 6000 ağacını biz dikelim. Hedef 6000 fidanı alıp Soma'nın Yırca köyüne dikilmesini sağlayalım.. Akmasak da birlik olup damlayalım. 15-20 yılda büyüyecek ağaçlar için hemen harekete geçelim!</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Gereken Nedir?</h3>
<div>Kişi başı sadece <b>11.50 TL veya 5$</b>
</div>
<div>Çünkü bir zeytin ağacı 11.50 TL <span style=""font-weight: bold;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;""><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Örneğin: </span></span><a href=""http://www.e-fidancim.com/Gemlik-Trilye-1-Yasli-Zeytin-Fidani60-70-cm,PR-30.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" style=""letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">http://www.e-fidancim.com/Gemlik-Trilye-1-Yasli-Zeytin-Fidani60-70-cm,PR-30.html</a>
</div>
<div><b>11.50TL x 6.000 Zeytin Ağacı Fidanı= 69.000 TL </b></div>
<div><b>69.000 TL = $30.000 + ortalama 1.000 dolar ağaç dikim malzemeleri, indiegogo site ve para transfer ücretleri.</b></div>
<div>(<span style=""background-color: initial;"">69.000 TL'lik bir zeytin fidanı alınacağı için  kargo masrafı olmayacaktır.)</span>
</div>
<div><b>Yani kişi başı 11.50 TL ile Soma'nın gelecek kuşaklara aktarılacak 6000 ağacını kurtarabiliriz! Soma'da senin de bir ağacın olabilir! </b></div>
<div> </div>
<div><h3><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Proje Başarıya Ulaşamazsa Ne Olacak?</span></h3></div>
<div><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Projede 6000 fidanlık meblağ toplanamazsa, bağışlar bugün köyün muhtarının CNN Türk'e bağlanıp <a href=""http://youtu.be/MOnPmwTyuZs"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">anlattığı</a> güvencesi olmayan ve madenden yeterince zarar gören ve ağaç kalmasa da nöbet tutmaya hala devam eden köylülere aynen aktarılacaktır. </span></div>

Amaç
Soma'da tam 6000 ağaç Termik Santral yapılması için kesildi. Danıştay iş işten geçtikten sonra yürütmeyi durdurdu. Şimdi orası boş. Tam 6000 ağaç yok yere gitti! Gelin birlik olup zaten maden kazasında yeterince zarar görmüş Soma'nın yok yere gitmiş 6000 ağacını biz dikelim. Hedef 6000 fidanı alıp Soma'nın Yırca köyüne dikilmesini sağlayalım.. Akmasak da birlik olup damlayalım. 15-20 yılda büyüyecek ağaçlar için hemen harekete geçelim!
 
 
Gereken Nedir?
Kişi başı sadece 11.50 TL veya 5$

Çünkü bir zeytin ağacı 11.50 TL Örneğin: http://www.e-fidancim.com/Gemlik-Trilye-1-Yasli-Zeytin-Fidani60-70-cm,PR-30.html

11.50TL x 6.000 Zeytin Ağacı Fidanı= 69.000 TL 
69.000 TL = $30.000 + ortalama 1.000 dolar ağaç dikim malzemeleri, indiegogo site ve para transfer ücretleri.
(69.000 TL'lik bir zeytin fidanı alınacağı için  kargo masrafı olmayacaktır.)

Yani kişi başı 11.50 TL ile Soma'nın gelecek kuşaklara aktarılacak 6000 ağacını kurtarabiliriz! Soma'da senin de bir ağacın olabilir! 
 
Proje Başarıya Ulaşamazsa Ne Olacak?
Projede 6000 fidanlık meblağ toplanamazsa, bağışlar bugün köyün muhtarının CNN Türk'e bağlanıp anlattığı güvencesi olmayan ve madenden yeterince zarar gören ve ağaç kalmasa da nöbet tutmaya hala devam eden köylülere aynen aktarılacaktır. 
 

Ben Kimim? Bana Neden Güvenesiniz?

Adım Eren Caner. Özel sektörde dijital reklamcı olarak çalışıyorum. Galatasaray Üniversitesi'nde master yapıyorum. Bir dönem üniversitede sosyal medyada marka yönetimi dersi verdim. Aşağıdaki bilgilerden hakkımda yeterince bilgi sahibi olabilir, gerektiğinde bana ulaşabilirsiniz.

2009 yılında lisans eğitimimde Turkcell, Teknosa, Arkas, Koç Akademi ve Bersay İletişim Grubu'ndan 26 üst düzey konuğun İstanbul'dan Eskişehir'e Eti gibi markalarla sponsorluk anlaşmaları imzalayarak sağlanan meblağ ile gelerek konuk olarak yer aldığı ve 300 kişinin bilet satın alarak katıldığı, çalışmalarının 9 ay, etkinliğin ise 2 tam gün sürdüğü Akademiler Zirvesi adlı organizasyonun genel koordinatörü olarak başında yer almıştım. Detaylar burada: http://e-gazete.anadolu.edu.tr/ayrinti.php?no=7693
 
Projenin Değerleri:



Bu zeytin ağaçları kesilmesin diye bir süredir nöbet tutan, ağaçların kesilmesini istemeyen köylülere moral olacak ve gelecek kuşaklara 6000 zeytin ağacı armağan edilecektir.
Proje amacına ulaşamazsa toplanan para bölgede zeytincilik yapan ve şimdi işsiz kalan köylülere aynen verilecektir. 
6000 ağaç en kısa sürede yerine dikileceği için Türkiye'nin termik santral sebebiyle eksik kalan ciğerleri yerine iade edilecektir.

Zeytin ağacı dikimi için en uygun zaman Ekim-Mart ayları arasıdır. Bağışlar kısa zamanda toplandığı taktirde 6000 yeni ağacın dikimi için hemen harekete geçilecektir. 

Proje başarıya ulaştığı taktirde medyada yer bulacağından projenin her adımı kolayca TV ve sosyal medyadan takip edilebilecektir. Ayrıca projenin Twitter hesabı: https://twitter.com/6000_Yeni_Agac 


 

Riskler & Zorluklar

6000 fidanı bir anda temin etmek zor olabilir. 6000 fidanın temin edilme süresine bağlı olarak 1-2 haftalık aralıklarla yapılabilir.
6000 ağacın dikiminde bir zorluk yaşanmaması için Soma'daki köylülerden ve TEMA'dan destek alınacaktır.

<p>I'm
studying cinematography at Bournemouth University where I specialise in natural

remember and started photographing it as soon as I could get my hands on a
camera.</p>
<p><b>What’s it all about?</b></p>
<p>I'm
heading out to the incredible island of Madagascar for one month to make a
wildlife documentary about the unique species that live there and why it is so
important to conserve them.</p>
<p>This
island has fascinated me for so long because of its outstanding wildlife and
remarkable and diverse ecosystems. 90% of the species there live nowhere else
on earth!</p>
<p>Most
people have seen the wonderful Disney cartoon Madagascar, but I would like to
show people the real Madagascar where many of the endemic species are
endangered, with some on the verge of extinction. </p>
<p>While
I’m making this documentary I will be travelling from the Capital 500 miles to
work on a conservation site in Andava, on the Southwest coast. While I’m there
I will be helping to protect the coral reefs, tortoises and assist with
sustainable fishing. I hope to document Lemurs, Chameleons, butterflies, Fossa,
tortoises, fish, plant life, insects and birds etc.</p>
<p>I
will have my cameras on me at all times and will even be filming underwater!</p>
<p><b>Why am I making it?</b></p>
<p><b>With your help I want to use this film to
show people how important and special the wildlife of Madagascar is and why it

<p>I
want to get this film seen in as many places as possible. I hope to enter my
film into documentary film festivals to raise awareness and also to get it
shown at schools in Madagascar to help educate children about the special
wildlife around them.</p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get for helping</h3>
<p>It’s
not cheap to make a documentary but I’ve done my very best to keep costs to a
minimum! The money raised will go towards the conservation project I am working
on, travel expenses and basic provisions.</p>
<p>In
return, depending on how much you donate, you can get a digital copy or hard
case DVD of the final documentary, a wildlife photograph from the expedition,
an invitation to the screening in London, special thanks in the credits, special
thanks on the IMDB page or you can even be an associate producer!</p>

<p>FullGallon is a growing social enterprise that empowers individuals and organizations to voluntarily claim these ""external gasoline costs""–the costs we impose on our environment, health, and future generations, but don't pay while we're filling up at the pump.</p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">This indiegogo campaign is striving to connect with passionate individuals to continue to build the community, form partnerships and to scale up the organization–all while beginning to claim gasoline's true costs to fund alternatives and offset damage.</span><br/></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""></span></p>
<p>Ultimately, FullGallon is raising awareness of artificially low gas prices, facilitating public discourse and empowering passionate citizens to fuel change.</p></span><p></p>

<p>Upon contributing to the campaign you'll receive an email asking for your input on the recipient organization(s) you would like to vote for in the campaign, including an overview description of each organization and its use of funds. Feel free to vote for more than one, but your vote will be split between the organizations you choose.</p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">The final list of proposed recipient organizations (funders get to vote on) includes one or two organizations from each of the following categories:</span><br/></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""><br/></span></p>
<p>1) <b>Clean energy research</b>, development and support (e.g. a clean tech incubator)</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>2) Specific <b>clean energy projects</b> (e.g. a solar panel project for a school)</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>3) <b>Smart growth</b> and <b>mass transit</b> organizations (e.g. Smart Growth America)</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>4) <b>Environmental remediation</b> (e.g. carbon offsets and the Environmental Defense Fund)</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>5) <b>Public health</b> organizations (e.g. asthma support for low income families)</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>6) <b>Veterans support </b>(e.g. nonprofits dedicated to health of service members returning home from overseas)</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p>Upon completion of the campaign, the three organizations that receive the most ""votes"" will receive 50%, 30% and 10%, respectively, of the total amount the campaign raised. The remaining 10% will be used to scale up FullGallon as described below (primarily web development). </p>
<p>Note that upon the launch of the FullGallon website, we anticipate allowing participants to choose the level of funding they would like to provide to FullGallon for its operating costs, ranging from 0% to 10% of their total contribution (rather than a fixed rate).</p>

<p></p>
<p>FullGallon's indiegogo campaign enables participants to select a desired amount of costs to claim vs. defer onto others. Claim as little as five cents per gallon (which equates to $2.28 for the average American driver over a one month period) all the way up to $5 per gallon ($228 for the average driver over one month).</p>
<p>Each perk is based on an average American's driving habits–about 13,000 miles per year in a vehicle that averages 25 miles per gallon. Feel free to adjust your contribution if you drive more or less than the average driver (or contact us if you need help!).</p>

<p></p>
<p>90% of contributions will be donated directly to three registered 501(c)3 nonprofit organizations, similar nonprofits, or social enterprises that you help choose based on what you care about most. The three organizations will be decided on by compiling all votes from the campaign's funders (each funder = one vote).</p>
<p>The available recipient organizations fall into two categories:</p>
<ul><li>Funding fossil fuel alternatives–clean energy, mass transportation, public policy and urban planning;</li></ul>
<ul><li>Offsetting gasoline’s damage–environmental restoration, carbon offsets, public health and veterans’ support.</li></ul>
<p>The remaining 10% of funds will be utilized to enable FullGallon to grow through the following means:</p>
<ul>
<li>Web development (currently underway and self-funded; estimated $20k);</li>
<li>Infographics -- a specialized infographic team will clearly, dynamically convey Full Gallon's cause (in contract stage; cost of $5k);  </li>
<li>Marketing and branding -- broaden awareness of artificially low gasoline prices and grow FullGallon's audience to fuel change;</li>
<li>Research to expand and update knowledge of gasoline's true costs -- stage 1 costs will cover travel to meet with economists specializing in the subject and relevant consulting fees from experts; stage 2 costs will fund primary research to develop the most comprehensive, independent and up-to-date estimate of the True Cost of Gasoline yet;  </li>
</ul>

<p>Exploring prices in other countries offers additional perspective on estimates of gasoline's true cost. For example, Norway pays close to $10 per gallon (despite being a major oil producer), while the Netherlands pays around $9. Europe on the whole averages $7.44 per gallon.</p>
<p>Moving further east, Australia and New Zealand hover around $6.50, the Japanese and South Koreans pay around $6.75, while Hong Kong pays a full $8.15 per gallon of gas.</p>
<p>On the other end of the spectrum, it's primarily the Middle East and Venezuela that pay less than the average price in the United States. The mere six cents per gallon paid by Venezuelans demonstrates just how subjective gasoline prices have become. </p>

For every gallon we buy, additional costs are being imposed. Estimates of the true cost of gasoline range from $6 to $20, compared to the average U.S. price of $3.59 per gallon. Who’s footing the bill? The environment, our public health, taxpayers, developing countries, the military and future generations.
Take a quick look at the short video Center for Investigative Reporting (CIR) produced outlining the issue.


What is FullGallon?
FullGallon is a growing social enterprise that empowers individuals and organizations to voluntarily claim these ""external gasoline costs""–the costs we impose on our environment, health, and future generations, but don't pay while we're filling up at the pump.
This indiegogo campaign is striving to connect with passionate individuals to continue to build the community, form partnerships and to scale up the organization–all while beginning to claim gasoline's true costs to fund alternatives and offset damage.

Ultimately, FullGallon is raising awareness of artificially low gas prices, facilitating public discourse and empowering passionate citizens to fuel change.

Upon contributing to the campaign you'll receive an email asking for your input on the recipient organization(s) you would like to vote for in the campaign, including an overview description of each organization and its use of funds. Feel free to vote for more than one, but your vote will be split between the organizations you choose.
The final list of proposed recipient organizations (funders get to vote on) includes one or two organizations from each of the following categories:

1) Clean energy research, development and support (e.g. a clean tech incubator)

2) Specific clean energy projects (e.g. a solar panel project for a school)

3) Smart growth and mass transit organizations (e.g. Smart Growth America)

4) Environmental remediation (e.g. carbon offsets and the Environmental Defense Fund)

5) Public health organizations (e.g. asthma support for low income families)

6) Veterans support (e.g. nonprofits dedicated to health of service members returning home from overseas)


Upon completion of the campaign, the three organizations that receive the most ""votes"" will receive 50%, 30% and 10%, respectively, of the total amount the campaign raised. The remaining 10% will be used to scale up FullGallon as described below (primarily web development). 
Note that upon the launch of the FullGallon website, we anticipate allowing participants to choose the level of funding they would like to provide to FullGallon for its operating costs, ranging from 0% to 10% of their total contribution (rather than a fixed rate).



Claim the True Cost of Gasoline

FullGallon's indiegogo campaign enables participants to select a desired amount of costs to claim vs. defer onto others. Claim as little as five cents per gallon (which equates to $2.28 for the average American driver over a one month period) all the way up to $5 per gallon ($228 for the average driver over one month).
Each perk is based on an average American's driving habits–about 13,000 miles per year in a vehicle that averages 25 miles per gallon. Feel free to adjust your contribution if you drive more or less than the average driver (or contact us if you need help!).

Fund Alternatives, Offset Damage, Grow FullGallon

90% of contributions will be donated directly to three registered 501(c)3 nonprofit organizations, similar nonprofits, or social enterprises that you help choose based on what you care about most. The three organizations will be decided on by compiling all votes from the campaign's funders (each funder = one vote).
The available recipient organizations fall into two categories:
Funding fossil fuel alternatives–clean energy, mass transportation, public policy and urban planning;
Offsetting gasoline’s damage–environmental restoration, carbon offsets, public health and veterans’ support.
The remaining 10% of funds will be utilized to enable FullGallon to grow through the following means:

Web development (currently underway and self-funded; estimated $20k);
Infographics -- a specialized infographic team will clearly, dynamically convey Full Gallon's cause (in contract stage; cost of $5k);  
Marketing and branding -- broaden awareness of artificially low gasoline prices and grow FullGallon's audience to fuel change;
Research to expand and update knowledge of gasoline's true costs -- stage 1 costs will cover travel to meet with economists specializing in the subject and relevant consulting fees from experts; stage 2 costs will fund primary research to develop the most comprehensive, independent and up-to-date estimate of the True Cost of Gasoline yet;  


More on Gas Prices...


The study (pdf) referenced in CIR's video above estimates the true cost of gasoline could be up to $15, according to findings by the International Center for Technology Assessment (ICTA) in 1998.
More recently, in 2007 the Earth Policy Institute compiled an updated estimate (pdf) of the True Price of Gasoline using the ICTA's previous study, as well as more recent updates from them and other sources. The Earth Policy Institute estimates the following hidden gasoline cost breakdowns:





Category of Cost We
  Do Not Pay at the Pump
Cost per Gallon


Environment, Health and Social Costs
$5.98


Subsidies - Production and Consumption
$0.42


Supply and Shipment Protection Costs
$0.48


Other Externalities - dependence &
  price shock risk, etc.
$3.35



Total Additional Costs (that we don't pay at the pump)
$10.23



A visualization of the Earth Policy Institute's estimated ranges of the True Price of Gasoline is seen below based on four categories of hidden costs (as shown above). An aggressive estimate is seen in red, a conservative estimate in orange and the average in green. The blue bar represents the average retail price Americans currently pay ($3.59).












Exploring prices in other countries offers additional perspective on estimates of gasoline's true cost. For example, Norway pays close to $10 per gallon (despite being a major oil producer), while the Netherlands pays around $9. Europe on the whole averages $7.44 per gallon.
Moving further east, Australia and New Zealand hover around $6.50, the Japanese and South Koreans pay around $6.75, while Hong Kong pays a full $8.15 per gallon of gas.
On the other end of the spectrum, it's primarily the Middle East and Venezuela that pay less than the average price in the United States. The mere six cents per gallon paid by Venezuelans demonstrates just how subjective gasoline prices have become. 

A Few Examples of Potential Recipient Organizations Funders Vote For:





Transparency
All funders will receive formal documentation that 90% of the campaign's total funds raised were provided to the three organizations you help choose within 15 days after the close of the campaign (we are happy to make such documentation publicly available). Formal documentation of the 10% of the campaign's total funds being utilized to scale up FullGallon will be provided within 60 days of the campaign's close.




FullGallon, nor anyone involved in FullGallon, has any pre-existing relationships with any of the organizations that will be offered as potential recipient organizations (relative to the 90% of the campaign's funds being allocated to recipient organizations).

<p><strong>Who Are We?</strong></p>
<p>George Mason Engineer's for International Development (EfID) is a student organization that is housed in the Department of Civil, Environmental and Infrastructure Engineering (CEIE) at George Mason University.    We exist for Civil Engineering Students to participate in community-driven development programs worldwide through the design and implementation of sustainable engineering projects. We work both internationally and locally to build and educate communities about their basic infrastructure systems such as drinking water and sanitation. </p>
<p>EfID was founded in 2010 as a Recognized Student Organization at GMU.  EfID has accomplished significant work in Honduras, the Peruvian Andes, and the Amazon addressing small communities' concerns over water shortages, clean water access, sanitation, and hygiene.  Please visit our <a href=""https://sites.google.com/site/eidmason/home"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">website</a> for more information about EfID. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>The Need !</strong></p>
<p>This year we have several projects that we are working on, however we have one particular project that is in dire need of additional funding.  The project that is in dire need of funding is our Grande Sabana, Nicaragua project. </p>
<p>Grande Sabana is a small community nestled in the mountains of northern Nicaragua.  The community has one failing water well that is in desperate need of repairs.  Many of the community's children currently walk a great distance to the well to retrieve a small amount of water.  This failing well is the primary source of water for drinking, cooking and cleaning and is not an efficient means of meeting the needs of the community regarding quantity or quality.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Moving Forward...</strong></p>
<p>EfID has scheduled a trip in January 10, 2013 to assess the scope of the project, and material availability. On this trip, a team made up of GMU students and Professional Engineers will investigate the well and water storage location options and alternatives for the community, as well as the availability of materials locally for installation.</p>
<p>Based on the scope developed as a result of the assessment trip, a team of students will design a new well and water distribution system to meet the needs of the community. The assessment trip report will be available in February 2013.  </p>
<p>The team will make a second trip to Nicaragua during the summer of 2013 to install the well, and water system. EfID plans to work with and involve the community to ensure the proposed solutions satisfy their needs. Educating the community about the system, the sustainable solar powered pump, and how it will improve their lives will enable them to successfully continue to operate the water storage and distribution system and provide sufficient water for all residents.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>The Funding Situation.</strong></p>
<p>To fully fund the Grande Sabana, Nicaragua project we need $30,000.  Since August 2012, we have been able to raise about $15,000 from various sources.   (We are half way!) </p>

<p class=""MsoNoteLevel1CxSpMiddle"" style=""margin-left: 0cm; text-indent: 0cm;"">We have the <a href=""http://g.co/maps/k9bzf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">land</a> and for the moment we are looking for

people will have the chance to live sustainably and experience at first hand
the eco solutions in everyday life, to enjoy natural food from our cultivations
, to take part in workshops, to help with the maintenance of the farm and with
the camping running in general as semi-permanent residents, visitors, wwoofers

<p class=""MsoNoteLevel1CxSpMiddle"" style=""margin-left: 0cm; text-indent: 0cm;"">The farm will also accept school kid
groups and other groups of people or individuals who want to educate themselves
on sustainable living and its applications.</p><p></p>
<p class=""MsoNoteLevel1CxSpMiddle"" style=""margin-left: 0cm; text-indent: 0cm;"">All the facilities in the farm are
designed to be usable from people with special needs.</p><p></p>
<p class=""MsoNoteLevel1CxSpMiddle"" style=""margin-left: 0cm; text-indent: 0cm;"">And now letâ€™s pass to this campaignâ€™s
special interest which is the NURSERY for our seeds:</p><p></p>
<p class=""MsoNoteLevel1CxSpMiddle"" style=""margin-left: 0cm; text-indent: 0cm;"">Major part of the farming and
agroturistic activities shall be the cultivation of medicine plants and herbs
and super - nutritional foods(fruits in our case). Specifically: 4 different
varieties of cornus , hippophaes , Aronia(black chokeberry), Goji( the original
Tibetan variety). We hope that these cultivations will allow us to earn some
money because they are supposed to be much wanted and easily absorbable from
the market, especially from the organic food market. We would also like to make
a small food processing unit.</p><p></p>
<p class=""MsoNoteLevel1CxSpMiddle"" style=""margin-left: 0cm; text-indent: 0cm;"">Apart from the cultivations above we
will plant of course everything we need for our personal everyday consuming and
there we are going to use exclusively seeds from traditional varieties in order
to help save bioversity. Eventually we are going to make a seed bank and become
seed preservers. Those seeds we have acquired from cultivators and
seed-keepers, members of the Peliti community(<a href=""http://www.peliti.gr/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.peliti.gr/</a>).
Check out what they are doing!</p><p></p>
<p class=""MsoNoteLevel1CxSpMiddle"" style=""margin-left: 0cm; text-indent: 0cm;"">Following is an overview of the
project:</p><p></p>
<p class=""MsoNoteLevel1CxSpMiddle"" style=""margin-left: 0cm; text-indent: 0cm;"">We are going to grow the plants right
from the crop that is why we need to build our own nursery. We already have the
crops, we just need a nursery and all the necessary equipment for watering,
warming the nursery etc. We will put the plants into the earth as soon as they
are ready for this transition (super-foods when they are around 1 year-old,
ordinary vegetables much sooner). </p><p></p>
<p class=""MsoNoteLevel1CxSpMiddle"" style=""margin-left: 0cm; text-indent: 0cm;"">But before that we need to clean and
prepare the land area where the nursery is going to be build which at the
moment is almost a jungle. The final planting area is already formed. We would
like to use the spare wood from the land cleaning in a way that could benefit
the nursery. How is that? It will be clear on next paragraph.</p><p></p>
<p class=""MsoNoteLevel1CxSpMiddle"" style=""margin-left: 0cm; text-indent: 0cm;"">As the plants will start growing and
requiring their regular pruning we will want to use all the wood out of the
pruning -instead of throwing it away or burning it as people use to do in the
countryside- in order to make pellets for the stove which in its turn will be
used as a means for heating the nursery. But, to make pellets we need first a
branch destroyer which will produce the wood biomass and then a pellet press
machine to produce pellets out of the biomass. So, the spare wood from the
grown-up plants will promote the growth of the new ones by warming their
â€˜wombâ€™, the nursery.</p><p></p>
<p class=""MsoNoteLevel1CxSpMiddle"" style=""margin-left: 0cm; text-indent: 0cm;""> </p><p></p>

will grow plants right from the crop in order for us first to cover our farmâ€™s

income from selling grown-up plants and thus helping financially to complete

course this is life and we love the challenge of all of this! We are confident
that as soon as we have made a good start only good things shall come to
support us on this magic trial of our life.</p><p></p>
<p class=""MsoNoteLevel1CxSpMiddle"" style=""margin-left: 0cm; text-indent: 0cm;"">If we donâ€™t raise the goal money and
depending on the amount raised we will buy some of the equipment f.e. the
nursery only or the pellet stove only or the branch destroyer and so on and
will try to collect the rest of the amount with various ways. Of course by
starting a new campaign, and then by saving a small amount monthly from our
family income in order to buy one at a time the parts of the equipment. And of
course we will accept the fact that things will evolve on a much slower
pace. </p><p></p>
<p class=""MsoNoteLevel1CxSpMiddle"" style=""margin-left: 0cm; text-indent: 0cm;"">Our only income which is roughly
1000euros per month comes from the renting of our appartments in Athens.
We rented our house in order to be able to quit our jobs and have moved on a
small cottage house close to the farm. There we are happier because we are
growing up all together with our 3 year-old daughter who is having a great time
with a garden to play and animals and earth and a smiling mamma and papa. There
we have more time to organise the creation of our farm and center. That would
have been impossible to do if we had to go to work too. It would have been
impossible for us now to write this text. It is a big deal this change and with
our (no) budget it needs also a lot of courage to keep believing in it. So, we
are in a transitional phase. We are happy though, because now we are working for
a purpose WE have set for ourselves, a purpose that doesnâ€™t betray our
consiousness and on which we can place our faith and efforts. We are not
considering ourselves as poor, but we definitely donâ€™t have the money to go
further on our own, unless we do it in a very very slow pace. We hope also that
in the meantime before this campaign ends more people will have joined our
team. </p><p></p>
<p class=""MsoNoteLevel1CxSpMiddle"" style=""margin-left: 0cm; text-indent: 0cm;"">Remember, we have just started talking
about our project to other people and I have to say that it is very moving to
see people living on big cities and working full time responding immediately by
offering their help for the weekends and their encouragement. Here in Greece
almost everybody, especially those living in the big cities like Athens, has
realized that it is time to change their living standards in a different way
than they used to think about it before, meaning not by making more money, but
by having more time for a meaningful life and relationships, living closer to
nature, cultivating their own food, reducing their carbon footprint and
pursuing sustainability and as much self-sufficiency as they can achieve. But,
when your life is settled somewhere or you have family and kids to take care
of, it is very hard to do the big step to change lifestyle, especially when
there is no capital to start with. Our family was just like that. We want to
change our life and we have just made the beginning by deciding to leave our
permanent jobs and city and to use a piece of land we owned in order to create
our base there and to find alternative ways of earning a small income from
activities that will satisfy us on the whole, such as cultivating the earth,
organising events and workshops, producing essential oils and food products,
offering healing sessions(Yannis is a certified sound massage healer and a
tai-chi devoted student), teaching music and yoga in the nearby
community(Thalia is a pianist, singer and a certified yoga teacher).</p><p></p>

Hello! We have started this
campaign to raise funds in order to construct a nursery and buy the necessary
equipment and machinery for watering, heating and producing biomase. Biomase
produced from spare wood and used to make pellets for the nursery heating
system. 
 
We are a family(Thalia, Yannis and
small Anthi)and some friends who have decided to change their way of life. Itâ€™s
been some months now that we have started putting all our efforts in the
process of creating an eco retreat center in Evia , Greece.
We have the land and for the moment we are looking for
the best eco solutions as energy , waste management , toilets , healthy houses
, food production â€“sustainable living in general-are concerned.
 
For the near future we must build a
yoga area in order for thai massage and other workshops to run throughout
 summer.
Our wish is to create a place where
people will have the chance to live sustainably and experience at first hand
the eco solutions in everyday life, to enjoy natural food from our cultivations
, to take part in workshops, to help with the maintenance of the farm and with
the camping running in general as semi-permanent residents, visitors, wwoofers
and other volunteers.
The farm will also accept school kid
groups and other groups of people or individuals who want to educate themselves
on sustainable living and its applications.
All the facilities in the farm are
designed to be usable from people with special needs.
And now letâ€™s pass to this campaignâ€™s
special interest which is the NURSERY for our seeds:
Major part of the farming and
agroturistic activities shall be the cultivation of medicine plants and herbs
and super - nutritional foods(fruits in our case). Specifically: 4 different
varieties of cornus , hippophaes , Aronia(black chokeberry), Goji( the original
Tibetan variety). We hope that these cultivations will allow us to earn some
money because they are supposed to be much wanted and easily absorbable from
the market, especially from the organic food market. We would also like to make
a small food processing unit.
Apart from the cultivations above we
will plant of course everything we need for our personal everyday consuming and
there we are going to use exclusively seeds from traditional varieties in order
to help save bioversity. Eventually we are going to make a seed bank and become
seed preservers. Those seeds we have acquired from cultivators and
seed-keepers, members of the Peliti community(http://www.peliti.gr/).
Check out what they are doing!
Following is an overview of the
project:
We are going to grow the plants right
from the crop that is why we need to build our own nursery. We already have the
crops, we just need a nursery and all the necessary equipment for watering,
warming the nursery etc. We will put the plants into the earth as soon as they
are ready for this transition (super-foods when they are around 1 year-old,
ordinary vegetables much sooner). 
But before that we need to clean and
prepare the land area where the nursery is going to be build which at the
moment is almost a jungle. The final planting area is already formed. We would
like to use the spare wood from the land cleaning in a way that could benefit
the nursery. How is that? It will be clear on next paragraph.
As the plants will start growing and
requiring their regular pruning we will want to use all the wood out of the
pruning -instead of throwing it away or burning it as people use to do in the
countryside- in order to make pellets for the stove which in its turn will be
used as a means for heating the nursery. But, to make pellets we need first a
branch destroyer which will produce the wood biomass and then a pellet press
machine to produce pellets out of the biomass. So, the spare wood from the
grown-up plants will promote the growth of the new ones by warming their
â€˜wombâ€™, the nursery.
 
So, specifically we will need:
 
A water tank in
order to collect the rain water for watering the plants. 20mÂ³  - 
2.650â‚¬
 
Wood material for the structure
of the greenhouse  the floor and  shelves
where the pots will stand.
â€“ 16â‚¬/mÂ². So, the cost for 40mÂ² is
around 640â‚¬ for the floor. As for the shelves and the structure the cost is
around 2.500â‚¬ . - Total  3.140â‚¬
 
 
Plastic
tubes for watering -  
Electrical
pumps for watering
-                     
1.596â‚¬                                     
                             
Electrical
valves for watering. â€“
 
Appropriate solar panels for the
electrical needs of the watering system.
 
Small 
and medium pots  for the plants. â€“ pot with dimensions 7cm internal
diameter x 7cm external diameter x 8cm high  (0,25 lit)  costs
0,083â‚¬/unit, so for 1000 units  83â‚¬ .Pot with dimensions  15cm
internal diameter x 15cm external diameter x  20cm high   (3,40
lit) costs 0,512â‚¬/unit, so for 1000 units  512â‚¬.  - Total 
595â‚¬
 
A branch
destroyer by which spare wood from cleaning the land and pruning will turn
to wood biomass  â€“ 1.968â‚¬
 
A pellet press
machine to produce pellets out of the wood biomass. â€“ 1.100â‚¬
 
A pellet
stove with air tubes, controlled pellet consumption and temperature , for
warming the greenhouse when necessary. â€“ around 2.150â‚¬
 
Total amount :   
13.289â‚¬
 
Of course we will continue using the
nursery system even after those first plants will have moved into the earth. We
will grow plants right from the crop in order for us first to cover our farmâ€™s
constant needs(personal consumption) and second to be able to earn an extra
income from selling grown-up plants and thus helping financially to complete
the whole retreat project.
Also if anyone has already all this
equipment or parts of it and wishes to offer them for the project (even offer
them for a specific period of time) we are open to listen to any proposition.
How much work needs to be done! But of
course this is life and we love the challenge of all of this! We are confident
that as soon as we have made a good start only good things shall come to
support us on this magic trial of our life.
If we donâ€™t raise the goal money and
depending on the amount raised we will buy some of the equipment f.e. the
nursery only or the pellet stove only or the branch destroyer and so on and
will try to collect the rest of the amount with various ways. Of course by
starting a new campaign, and then by saving a small amount monthly from our
family income in order to buy one at a time the parts of the equipment. And of
course we will accept the fact that things will evolve on a much slower
pace. 
Our only income which is roughly
1000euros per month comes from the renting of our appartments in Athens.
We rented our house in order to be able to quit our jobs and have moved on a
small cottage house close to the farm. There we are happier because we are
growing up all together with our 3 year-old daughter who is having a great time
with a garden to play and animals and earth and a smiling mamma and papa. There
we have more time to organise the creation of our farm and center. That would
have been impossible to do if we had to go to work too. It would have been
impossible for us now to write this text. It is a big deal this change and with
our (no) budget it needs also a lot of courage to keep believing in it. So, we
are in a transitional phase. We are happy though, because now we are working for
a purpose WE have set for ourselves, a purpose that doesnâ€™t betray our
consiousness and on which we can place our faith and efforts. We are not
considering ourselves as poor, but we definitely donâ€™t have the money to go
further on our own, unless we do it in a very very slow pace. We hope also that
in the meantime before this campaign ends more people will have joined our
team. 
Remember, we have just started talking
about our project to other people and I have to say that it is very moving to
see people living on big cities and working full time responding immediately by
offering their help for the weekends and their encouragement. Here in Greece
almost everybody, especially those living in the big cities like Athens, has
realized that it is time to change their living standards in a different way
than they used to think about it before, meaning not by making more money, but
by having more time for a meaningful life and relationships, living closer to
nature, cultivating their own food, reducing their carbon footprint and
pursuing sustainability and as much self-sufficiency as they can achieve. But,
when your life is settled somewhere or you have family and kids to take care
of, it is very hard to do the big step to change lifestyle, especially when
there is no capital to start with. Our family was just like that. We want to
change our life and we have just made the beginning by deciding to leave our
permanent jobs and city and to use a piece of land we owned in order to create
our base there and to find alternative ways of earning a small income from
activities that will satisfy us on the whole, such as cultivating the earth,
organising events and workshops, producing essential oils and food products,
offering healing sessions(Yannis is a certified sound massage healer and a
tai-chi devoted student), teaching music and yoga in the nearby
community(Thalia is a pianist, singer and a certified yoga teacher).
 
Now,what can we offer back to you? Of
course grown-up plants, dry fruits and any other fruit product we may
prepare(jams, juices) and for those who want to visit Greece accommodation(how
many days depending to your contribution), participation to any of our

</div></div>","Announcing New Perks!!!
You asked for more perks and you got 'em! Some of the new goodies you can get in exchange for supporting ClimateStore on Indiegogo include a super-handy collapsible water bottle, a bamboo kitchen composter, our sleek Pixio solar bike lights, and the very versatile Scrubba washbag. These are some of our favorite products we’ve found over the past year, and we can’t wait to bring you 1,000 more innovative, carbon-lowering tools and resources. 


Our Vision

Climate change is real. The debate is over and it's time to act! The problem is that it is not clear what to do and what will make an impact.
Well, no more! Our vision is to build a national sustainable brand that has all the information and products you need to reduce your carbon footprint - all in one place. No more cluttered, overwhelming aisles of light bulbs at Home Depot. We're simplifying the shopping experience for everyone that wants to 
#kickcarbon! We're all busy people. Shopping with the climate in mind needs to be fun and easy. 
We also have great resources for learning about climate change, how to get involved, and ideas for sustainable living that don't cost a thing. Check out these shots from our current, live website www.climatestore.com!


Our Campaign
A crowdfunding campaign is a great way to sponsor mission driven companies. In exchange for a donation to our project, our supporters not only get to feel good about contributing to a great cause, they also get to be included on updates on our project and may also receive one of the many “perks” that we offer, which are detailed in the right hand sidebar. We offer a bunch of “swag” gear (t-shirt, long sleeve shirts, sweatshirts, tote, mugs, and stickers) with some awesome and original climate themed designs. We also offer several product samplers kits, carbon offsets, and personal climate focused webinars!
Our campaign has received excellent media coverage, including stories by BostInno, a big Boston based start-up blog and on Treehugger, the largest eco blog in North America. We’ve also been featured in several newsletters and green living blogs like CABA, Boston Green Blog and True Moringa.


Our Project
During our first year at ClimateStore, we researched and selected more than 300 carbon-lowering household items for our online store.
Now we want to go big. Climate change is a big problem and it needs big solutions. Our first project is to triple the number of carbon-lowering products in our store. But this takes resources! We need your support so we can discover, 
qualify and bring you all those cool products that help us down the path to low carbon living.

Our Process - Discover, Qualify and Share 100's of Products

We're not interested in just one cool product, method or technology. Our goal is to discover 1,000 Climate Solutions for Everyday Life: electric bikes, energy efficient lighting, water saving devices, cleaner lawnmowers, home decor, solar and wind solutions, and way more.
Rest assured - we only carry items that have a beneficial link to the climate. We qualify each product to see if it was made in a low carbon manner, requires less energy to use, takes less energy to throw out, or is self powered using renewable resources. We also look for budget friendly items and educational benefit.

Our Icons - We Show You How Each Product is Good for the Climate

If an item passes our tests, we share it by making it available on our website www.climatestore.com. We also include what icons the product achieved, whether the manufacturer is sustainable, videos and information for best use. Our goal is to make it easy!


Our Budget - How We'll Turn $25,000 into 1000 New Products

Let's face it - we all need to get the message out about climate change. So, in addition to having access to a 1,000 cool products, you'll also get some awesome climate change swag!  We have just the right messages to get the conversation started; they'll engage others in the growing movement to #kickcarbon. 
All perks for donations over $100 will include your choice of t-shirt. We'll e-mail you for your preferred design and size after our campaign has closed. 
Stickers, Mugs, and Totes ($10 - $25)

<p><b>Bringing
Birds Back To Guam</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>Since 2010 we have been building
green roofs in Guam.  During our
first project, we learned about the ecological disaster created by the brown
tree snake.  Accidently introduced
in the early 1950’s by the military, the brown tree snake has literally eaten
most of the native birds on Guam.  We
want to change that by building minature snake-proof green roof “pods” that can
provide safe habitat for nesting birds. 
The first step is determining if our idea works and how to best implement
this solution.</p>
<p>We have already built three green
roof pods in an urban forest centrally located on Guam.  The next phase requires building a
larger “container green roof” and turning our research team loose documenting
the results and publishing papers. 
Two top researchers from the University of Helsinki who specialize in
green roofs and zoology are on the team. 
This is serious stuff.</p>
<p>For over sixty years the problem has
gotten worse on Guam.  We think
it’s time to stop looking in the rear view mirror at what’s happened and start
looking for ways to allow the birds and snakes to coexist.  </p>
<p>We think we can turn this thing
around using an ancient technology – green roofs.  There is a way out of this mess, but we need your help to
take the next step.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1193372/files/20150203091503-Slide1.jpg?1422983703"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/>
<p><b><span>What We Need</span></b></p>
<p>Phase I is
complete.  We built three green
roof pods and installed three trail cameras to document snake and bird activity
24/7/365.  We paid for Phase I out
of our own pocket.  Our sponsor -
LMS Guam – helped out with black lava cinders for the green roof soil, native
plants, and vehicles and equipment to build the pods.</p>
<p>To complete Phase
II we need your help.  Here are the
expenses to get Phase II running:</p>
<p>·<span>  </span>Purchase 40’ shipping container and move to site </p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">·</span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> 
</span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Purchase and
install green roof on container </span></p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>Install
trail cameras                                                           </p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>Pay local
field researchers to monitor the pod </p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Fortunately, our
green roof project at the Guam Medical City Hospital puts us back in Guam
during March and April 2015. 
During that time we hope to build out the shipping container green roof
pod and begin analyzing the data. 
Our colleagues in Finland are already working on finding funding to
cover their travel to Guam.  We
hope to publish a paper or two in a scientific journal by the end of the year.</span></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Other Ways You Can Help</b></p>
<p>Obviously, Phase II is super
important to understanding how green roofs can help bring birds back to
Guam.  If you aren’t able to
contribute right now, please:</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>make some noise about our campaign.</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>keep following our project and see
what happens.</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>start reading National Geographic and
learn what people are doing everyday to m<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">ake the world a better place.</span></p>

<p><b>The Real Impact</b></p>
<p>Researchers
have known for a long time that in order for birds to coexist with brown tree
snakes they must be able to nest and roost in locations that are snake –proof
(Conry 1987).  Urban areas are
especially important since they provide isolation from large forests and
vegetated areas that attract snakes (Wiles 2003).  Green roof bird pods designed to maximize the four ideal bird habitat
factors of food, cover, water, and space (Shaw 1985 and Fernandez-Canero, 2010), and placed in urban or
disturbed areas may be the answer - BINGO!</p>

</div></div>","Bringing
Birds Back To Guam

Since 2010 we have been building
green roofs in Guam.  During our
first project, we learned about the ecological disaster created by the brown
tree snake.  Accidently introduced
in the early 1950’s by the military, the brown tree snake has literally eaten
most of the native birds on Guam.  We
want to change that by building minature snake-proof green roof “pods” that can
provide safe habitat for nesting birds. 
The first step is determining if our idea works and how to best implement
this solution.
We have already built three green
roof pods in an urban forest centrally located on Guam.  The next phase requires building a
larger “container green roof” and turning our research team loose documenting
the results and publishing papers. 
Two top researchers from the University of Helsinki who specialize in
green roofs and zoology are on the team. 
This is serious stuff.
For over sixty years the problem has
gotten worse on Guam.  We think
it’s time to stop looking in the rear view mirror at what’s happened and start
looking for ways to allow the birds and snakes to coexist.  
We think we can turn this thing
around using an ancient technology – green roofs.  There is a way out of this mess, but we need your help to
take the next step.



What We Need
Phase I is
complete.  We built three green
roof pods and installed three trail cameras to document snake and bird activity
24/7/365.  We paid for Phase I out
of our own pocket.  Our sponsor -
LMS Guam – helped out with black lava cinders for the green roof soil, native
plants, and vehicles and equipment to build the pods.
To complete Phase
II we need your help.  Here are the
expenses to get Phase II running:
·  Purchase 40’ shipping container and move to site 
· 
Purchase and
install green roof on container 
· 
Install
trail cameras                                                           
· 
Pay local
field researchers to monitor the pod 
Fortunately, our
green roof project at the Guam Medical City Hospital puts us back in Guam
during March and April 2015. 
During that time we hope to build out the shipping container green roof
pod and begin analyzing the data. 
Our colleagues in Finland are already working on finding funding to
cover their travel to Guam.  We
hope to publish a paper or two in a scientific journal by the end of the year.

Other Ways You Can Help
Obviously, Phase II is super
important to understanding how green roofs can help bring birds back to
Guam.  If you aren’t able to
contribute right now, please:
· 
make some noise about our campaign.
· 
keep following our project and see
what happens.
· 
start reading National Geographic and
learn what people are doing everyday to make the world a better place.


What You Get












The Real Impact
Researchers
have known for a long time that in order for birds to coexist with brown tree
snakes they must be able to nest and roost in locations that are snake –proof
(Conry 1987).  Urban areas are
especially important since they provide isolation from large forests and
vegetated areas that attract snakes (Wiles 2003).  Green roof bird pods designed to maximize the four ideal bird habitat
factors of food, cover, water, and space (Shaw 1985 and Fernandez-Canero, 2010), and placed in urban or
disturbed areas may be the answer - BINGO!

The Team

We are a group of scientists, business leaders, inventors,
and outdoors people who love wild places and creatures of all kinds.  When things go wrong in nature – like
the accidental introduction of the brown tree Snake on Guam – we look for a way
out.  
The team is led by Roger Grothe, President of Aloha Landscaping.  After attending graduate school at San
Jose State University and working at Lockheed Martin as a research consultant for 16 years, Roger formed
Aloha Landscaping and became a leader in green roof design and construction.  

Dr. Ferenc Vilisics earned his PhD in Environmental Sciences in University
of Debrecen in Hungary.  He is a
zoologist and ecologist with decade-long experience in anthropogenic (human
caused) effects on ecosystems. 


Dr. Susanna
Lehvävirta earned her PhD in Urban Ecology from the University of
Helsinki. She is keen on finding solutions to complex scientific and societal problems in order to make the life of people as well as other
living creatures better on the globe.

Jesse Grothe is a
student at the University of Wisconsin studying Sustainable Management.  He has also studied in Helsinki,
Finland conducting green roof research. 
He loves a good challenge and between coaching wrestling and trail
running he operates a state-of-the-art organic tomato farm near Minneapolis.  


Guam Micronesian
Kingfisher is our
official mascot.  Extinct in the
wild due to the brown tree snake, the 
last 29 kingfishers were captured between 1984 and 1986.  The Lincoln
Park Zoo in Chicago participates in the Guam Micronesian Kingfisher Species
Survival Plan®.  In the wild, the
Guam Micronesian kingfisher feeds on insects and lizards, catching them with
its large beak. It’s large beak is also used to
drill holes into trees and rotting wood for nesting. Male and female birds work
together to excavate the nest, an activity that may help the pair bond.  There is a hope that one-day pairs of
the Guam Micronesian Kingfisher could be returned to the wild – maybe a green
roof pod will become their home.

<p>“Bikes for you at TRU” has an insightful determination to create a bike
share community within the campus at Thompson Rivers University (TRU) in
Kamloops, British Columbia.  As simple as
it gets, we would like to implement a program where bikes are available free of
use to students and staff to commute around campus.  By using the “just take it, ride it, leave
it” mentality of the popular “car2go” system, we hope to get a pedal movement
happening on campus.  </p>
<p><u><b>Simple Steps to get you riding a “Bikes for you at TRU” bike:</b></u><br/>
*Drop in to the Environmental and Sustainability Office (OM 2691) to read and
sign the rider waiver<br/>
*Signing the waiver will allow you to get the combination to the lock to unlock
bikes around campus<br/>
*Find a bike on a campus bike rack, put on the helmet, and ride away!</p>
<p>With a positive outlook, we see these bikes helping students stretch
their legs between classes, commute in a timely manner, and spark an interest in
the two-wheel movement.  In the future,
if you see a green bike with sticker signage promoting “Bikes for You at TRU”
don’t just look at it – take it for a ride! 
</p>
<p>As a group of geography and science students at TRU, this project is
important to us as we see it having a positive and lasting impact on the
environment and social well-being on campus at TRU.  We believe that making bikes available for
anyone to use can have direct positive impacts on the individual and create a
sense of community collaboration and development.</p>
<p></p>
<h2><b>What We Need &amp; What You Get</b></h2>
<p>To get Bikes For You at TRU up and running, or should we say cycling, we
are looking to raise $1000. The reason behind this dollar figure being so large
is that we want this program to be sustainable and be available for future
students to use for years to come. The initial costs will include purchasing bikes,
helmets, and locks. The amount of funds raised will influence how many bikes we
can purchase. Upon start up, our goal is to have between three and five bikes,
adding to our selection as we raise the funds and the program becomes more
successful. Funds will also cover paint and signage used on the bikes. While
our campaign leaders are volunteering their time to paint the bikes, we need to
purchase a good quality paint that will last outside. The noticeable green
paint will allow these bikes to be easily recognized, letting everyone know
that this bike is available for them to borrow. </p>
<p>Aside from our website, we have chosen to promote Bikes For You at TRU
through the use of stickers. Stickers are a fun way to get the word out and by
displaying a sticker you can show people that you are a proud supported of a
student run initiative to promote cycling as an alternative form of
transportation. Raised funds will be used to cover the cost of stickers that
will be distributed to students, faculty, and staff, and will also be displayed
on the bikes up for borrow. As we mentioned, we want this program to continue,
therefore, any unused funds will remain with the program to cover maintenance
costs as the bikes experience normal wear and tear. Additional funds may also
be used to cover unexpected costs that arise throughout the project, as well as
to expand Bikes For You at TRU and collect more bikes in the future.</p>
<p></p>
<h2><b>The Impact</b></h2>
<p>Bikes For You at TRU is more than just about
obtaining bikes for student use. The idea of campus bikes has numerous impacts
that can positively affect not only the students using them, but the community,
and even the environment. First and foremost, campus bikes will help spark an
interest in biking. The idea behind this campaign is that this interest in
cycling will hopefully turn into something where more and more people begin
choosing bikes as an alternative form of transportation, thereby reducing the
amount of cars on the road and lowering emissions. By choosing cycling over
driving, people will become active in reducing their carbon footprint.  It may also give people the boost they need
to develop their own ways in which they can help. </p>
<p>Aside from this huge benefit, cycling saves
money. When using a bike, insurance, gas, and parking are essentially free, and
the cost of bike maintenance in comparison to that of cars is much more
affordable. Even still, there are further benefits of choosing to cycle,
including those related to health. Cycling can help you get in shape and stay
in shape, which is good for not only your physical health, but your mental
health as well. Finally, biking is fun! Cycling is a great way to get outdoors,
experience nature, and catch up with friends. As you can see there are many
benefits that go hand in hand with using cycling as an alternative form of
transportation, we just have to get started!</p>
<h2><b>Risks &amp;
Challenges</b></h2>
<p>Our Facebook page and website can be used as a means to keep tabs on all
of the bikes.  People will be able to
leave comments on both of these sites. Comments may include general inquiries
about the program, but can also include the whereabouts of bikes and if any of
them need servicing. By doing this, riders can post where they left the bike,
making it easy for someone searching for a bike to find, of course, this is no
guarantee as someone else might make it there before you do. </p>
<p>We are hoping to work with the Environment and Sustainability Office to
keep the bikes regularly serviced.  Riders
can also comment about the bikes condition on the Facebook page. As each bike
will be labeled with a specific identifiable characteristic (i.e. bike #1 has a
flat tire). By doing so, program operators will be able to tend to that bike as
soon as possible, ensuring that it’s ready to be rode once again. </p>
<h2><b>Other Ways You Can Help</b></h2>
<p>If you
can’t make a dollar donation that’s fine by us! There are plenty of other ways
that you can get involved to help promote biking as an alternative form of
transportation on our campus. For starters, you can tell your family and
friends about our campaign, the more people that know about it the better! We
are open to feedback, whether it is suggestions, tips, personal experiences, or
letting us know that we are doing a great job. Any comments can be left on our
Facebook page and website and we will be sure to address them in any way that
we can. If you are looking to take it one step further you can really get
involved by helping us carry out our project! There is lots of work to be done
and any volunteer efforts are greatly appreciated. <b>Furthermore, if you have an unwanted bike in good condition lying
around that you are willing to donate, we would be more than happy to come take
it off your hands.</b> Again, you can contact us through our Facebook page or
website. Any contributions, no matter what form or how small are greatly
appreciated and can help us get Bikes For You at TRU.   </p><br/></div>","Short Summary

<p>Green Maps are already being made all over the world to help
people connect with local resources for sustainable living and community wellbeing.
The Green Map movement has spread to 65 countries, and over 900
locally-led teams have created these fresh perspectives on home. Our nonprofit
has collected much of what’s been created, especially the <a href=""http://www.greenmap.org/greenhouse/en/maps/all"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">maps</a>, <a href=""http://www.greenmap.org/greenhouse/en/node/20720"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">stories</a> and <a href=""http://www.greenmap.org/greenhouse/albums"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">images</a> about local mapmaking processes, and the exciting ways they help build skills, networks and
knowledge about the environment and <a href=""http://www.greenmap.org/greenhouse/id/node/19453"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">community resiliency</a>. </p>
<p>At our global office in New York, we've collected workshop guides, education materials and engagement resources in
diverse mediums and languages. Now, with your help, we want to assess the
entire collection and create a new, streamlined toolkit that maximizes the
community building outcomes while incorporating new technologies and innovative
mapping applications. This valuable new toolkit will also highlight the next
phase of Green Map System’s trajectory as we move toward open source
development in 2015. </p>
<p>Green Map System's new toolkit will contribute to leadership,
communications and project management capacity building. It will help the city
agencies, nonprofits, youth and grassroots groups leverage wider stakeholder participation, with outstanding outcomes for
all who utilize the resulting maps as they shop, dine, get around, learn, work
and relax in a more sustainable and socially just way. </p>
<p><b>What We Need &amp;
What You Get</b></p>
<p>With climate
concerns and community health; green jobs, the sharing economy and go local
campaigns; new energy sources and green infrastructure coming to our
communities, we need help to refresh, reinvent and openly share our toolkit.
Let's help many more people become engaged in making their hometown,
region and world a better place to thrive!</p>
<p>Understanding
resiliency and related challenges will lead to meaningful participation in
sustainable development. Moreover, our network and partners will strengthen
one another, and provide a stronger base for all future Green Map projects to
build from. </p>
<p>Your
donations will go toward the first steps of toolkit development, including assessment, organization of online tool sharing and participation from
Green Mapmakers worldwide as well as interns in our office. Every dollar will
help!  In addition, we have stretch goals for project phases that include producing a consolidated, tested publication in print formats and even in different languages. </p><p>You'll receive updates on progress, access to the tools, copies of Green
Maps, and even a tour of Green Map sites around our East Village office. You’ll
also be able to use this toolkit to start a new project that involves and activates your own city, town or campus!</p>
<p><b>The Impact</b></p>
<p>The toolkit
will enable us to provide everyone from neighborhood stakeholders to city
officials to visitors with a fresh understanding of the local natural and
social environment and how their community can become engaged in being 'part of
the solution.' Thanks to the resulting Green Maps, the challenges and
opportunities of urban ecology will become more compelling and actionable!</p>
<p>This new
toolkit will help ensure our past informs our future. As described in our <a href=""http://GreenMap.org/news"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">blog</a>, the Archive of the Green Maps, now with 550 uniquely designed editions, is housed in the New York Public Library Map Collection. We're cataloging all the
research papers about the movement, too. We’ve collected Impact
stories, and co-produced numerous resources that address promotion, education and
public events. </p>
<p><b>Challenges &amp; Risks</b></p>
<p>There are
broad benefits that will amplify successful community-engaged

<p>Bonjour à toutes et à tous</p>
<p>Je m’appelle Grégory LOUIS.</p>
<p>Après avoir passé une partie de ma carrière dans le secteur de la gestion de patrimoine, j’ai eu envie de prendre un nouveau tournant, m’engager dans une entreprise qui ait du sens.</p>
<p>Passionné depuis  l’enfance par l’entomologie, l’univers des insectes s’est présenté à moi comme une évidence, ils sont LA réponse.</p>
<p>En effet notre monde, en profonde mutation, connait de plus en plus de disparités, mêlant des contradictions absurdes, mais bien réelles.</p>
<p>Pendant que certains souffrent de malnutrition et meurent de faim, d’autres, se laissant dépasser par un système de surconsommation perpétuelle, meurent des suites des nombreuses maladies liées à l’obésité.</p>
<p>Nous devons également  prendre conscience que, selon les NATIONS UNIES, d’ici 2050 la population mondiale atteindra le chiffre fou de 9 milliards d’individus, ce qui n’est pas pour arranger cette situation.</p>
<p>Selkys &amp; Co. Souhaite répondre à cette crise, en créant la première ferme d’insectes biologiques en France, de façon à garantir la traçabilité et la sécurité du consommateur.</p>
<p>Un élevage bio donc, destiné à l’alimentation humaine, en créant une gamme de produits gourmands,  restant néanmoins à la portée du plus grand nombre.</p>
<p><strong>Par exemple, cinq criquets représentent environ 150 grammes de viandes rouge, soit l’équivalent d’un steak.</strong>La FAO (Food and Agriculture Organisation), ONG reconnue mondialement, dit: « la plupart des insectes comestibles contiennent autant de protéines que la viande ou le poisson et sont encore plus nutritifs lorsqu’ils sont séchés. Certains insectes sont aussi riches en lipides, en vitamines ou minéraux. »</p>
<p>Cette alimentation très intéressante sur un plan nutritionnel,  contient en outre, une quantité importante  de Chitosan, molécule utilisée par les laboratoires pharmaceutiques pour développer des médicaments capables de lutter contre le stockage des graisses.</p>
<p>Il faut également se pencher sur l’aspect environnemental du projet, en effet, toujours d’après la FAO :  «  la filière de l'élevage émettrait plus de gaz à effet de serre que le secteur des transports. Elle émet :</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>9 % du dioxyde de carbone (CO2) mondial, à cause de l'extension des surfaces agricoles qui détruit les surfaces forestières.</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>37 % de méthane provenant du système digestif des ruminants.</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>65 % d'hémioxyde d'azote, émanant du fumier, qui a un potentiel de réchauffement global 296 fois plus élevé que le CO2.</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>64 % de l'ammoniac, qui contribue aux pluies acides. »</strong></p>
</li>
</ul><p> </p>
<p>Partant de tous ces constats, l’attitude à adopter désormais me parait claire : développer et démocratiser l’entomophagie.</p>
<p>Nous avons déjà plusieurs clients potentiels.</p>
<p>Si Selkys &amp; Co. Fait appel au crowdfunding aujourd’hui, c’est que nous avons besoin de vous pour mettre en œuvre cette idée, pour acheter le matériel nécessaire à l’élevage de nos insectes et préparer l’assemblage de nos premiers  produits.</p>
<p>Nous faisons appel à vous, plutôt qu’à une quelconque banque, car il me parait éviedent que nous sommes tous concernés, pour notre avenir, et celui de nos enfants.</p>
<p>Aidez-nous à créer l’alimentation de demain.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>                                           <strong> English Version</strong> </p>
<p>Good morning everybody,</p>
<p> </p>
<p>My name is Grégory louis.</p>
<p>Having spent part of my career in the field of wealth management, I wanted to take a new turn, hiring me in a enterprise which has sense.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Enthralled since childhood by entomology, the world of insects came me as an obviousness, they are answer.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Indeed, our world, in deep mutation, knows more and more disparities, mixing absurd contradictions, but real.</p>
<p>While some people suffer from malnutrition and die of hunger, others, allowed to show by a system of perpetual overconsumption, die from continuation of many diseases linked to obesity.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>We must also become aware that, according to the UNITED NATIONS, before 2050 the world population will attain the figure mad with 9 thousand million individuals, what is not to dispose this situation.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Selkys and Co. wishes to repond to this crisis, creating the first organic farm  insects in France, in order to ensure traceability and consumer safety.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>An animal husbandry bio therefore, intended for the human eating, by creating a range of products fond of good food, staying nevertheless within the reach of the biggest number.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>For example, five locusts represent about 150 grammes of meats red, that is the equivalent of a steak.</strong></p>
<p>The FAO (Food and Agriculture Organization), NGO admitted all over the world, says: «most eatable insect contains so many proteins as the meat or the fish and are even more nutritious when they are dried. Some insects are also rich in lipids, in vitamins or minerals.»</p>
<p> </p>
<p>This very interesting feeding on a nutritional plan, contains besides, an important quantity of Chitosan, molecule used by the pharmaceutical laboratories to develop medicaments capable of struggling against the stocking of grease.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>It is also necessary to lean over the environmental aspect of plan, indeed, always according to the FAO: «the course of study of animal husbandry would issue more gases with greenhouse effect than the sector of transport. She issues:</p>
<p><strong>• 9 % worldwide carbon dioxide (CO2), because of the extension of the agricultural surfaces which destroys the forested surfaces.</strong></p>
<p><strong>• 37 % of methane coming from the digestive tract of ruminants.</strong></p>
<p><strong>• 65 % of hémioxyde of nitrogen, emanating from some manure, with a potential of total warming 296 times as high as CO2.</strong></p>
<p><strong>• 64 % ammonias, who contributes to acid rains.»</strong></p>
<p>Leaving all these official reports, the attitude to be adopted from now on parried me clear: develop and democratise the entomophagie.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>We already have several potential clients.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>If Selkys and Co. Called the crowdfunding today, it is because we need you to implement this idea, to buy the equipment necessary for the animal husbandry of our insects and to prepare the assemblage of our first products.</p>
<p>We call you, rather than any bank, because he parried me éviedent that we all are concerned, for our future, and that of our children.</p>
<p>Help us to create feeding of tomorrow.</p>
<p>(Please excuse my rough English)</p>

Passionné depuis  l’enfance par l’entomologie, l’univers des insectes s’est présenté à moi comme une évidence, ils sont LA réponse.
En effet notre monde, en profonde mutation, connait de plus en plus de disparités, mêlant des contradictions absurdes, mais bien réelles.
Pendant que certains souffrent de malnutrition et meurent de faim, d’autres, se laissant dépasser par un système de surconsommation perpétuelle, meurent des suites des nombreuses maladies liées à l’obésité.
Nous devons également  prendre conscience que, selon les NATIONS UNIES, d’ici 2050 la population mondiale atteindra le chiffre fou de 9 milliards d’individus, ce qui n’est pas pour arranger cette situation.
Selkys & Co. Souhaite répondre à cette crise, en créant la première ferme d’insectes biologiques en France, de façon à garantir la traçabilité et la sécurité du consommateur.
Un élevage bio donc, destiné à l’alimentation humaine, en créant une gamme de produits gourmands,  restant néanmoins à la portée du plus grand nombre.
Par exemple, cinq criquets représentent environ 150 grammes de viandes rouge, soit l’équivalent d’un steak.La FAO (Food and Agriculture Organisation), ONG reconnue mondialement, dit: « la plupart des insectes comestibles contiennent autant de protéines que la viande ou le poisson et sont encore plus nutritifs lorsqu’ils sont séchés. Certains insectes sont aussi riches en lipides, en vitamines ou minéraux. »
Cette alimentation très intéressante sur un plan nutritionnel,  contient en outre, une quantité importante  de Chitosan, molécule utilisée par les laboratoires pharmaceutiques pour développer des médicaments capables de lutter contre le stockage des graisses.
Il faut également se pencher sur l’aspect environnemental du projet, en effet, toujours d’après la FAO :  «  la filière de l'élevage émettrait plus de gaz à effet de serre que le secteur des transports. Elle émet :


9 % du dioxyde de carbone (CO2) mondial, à cause de l'extension des surfaces agricoles qui détruit les surfaces forestières.


37 % de méthane provenant du système digestif des ruminants.


65 % d'hémioxyde d'azote, émanant du fumier, qui a un potentiel de réchauffement global 296 fois plus élevé que le CO2.


64 % de l'ammoniac, qui contribue aux pluies acides. »

 
Partant de tous ces constats, l’attitude à adopter désormais me parait claire : développer et démocratiser l’entomophagie.
Nous avons déjà plusieurs clients potentiels.
Si Selkys & Co. Fait appel au crowdfunding aujourd’hui, c’est que nous avons besoin de vous pour mettre en œuvre cette idée, pour acheter le matériel nécessaire à l’élevage de nos insectes et préparer l’assemblage de nos premiers  produits.
Nous faisons appel à vous, plutôt qu’à une quelconque banque, car il me parait éviedent que nous sommes tous concernés, pour notre avenir, et celui de nos enfants.
Aidez-nous à créer l’alimentation de demain.

Good morning everybody,
 
My name is Grégory louis.
Having spent part of my career in the field of wealth management, I wanted to take a new turn, hiring me in a enterprise which has sense.
 
Enthralled since childhood by entomology, the world of insects came me as an obviousness, they are answer.
 
Indeed, our world, in deep mutation, knows more and more disparities, mixing absurd contradictions, but real.
While some people suffer from malnutrition and die of hunger, others, allowed to show by a system of perpetual overconsumption, die from continuation of many diseases linked to obesity.
 
We must also become aware that, according to the UNITED NATIONS, before 2050 the world population will attain the figure mad with 9 thousand million individuals, what is not to dispose this situation.
 
Selkys and Co. wishes to repond to this crisis, creating the first organic farm  insects in France, in order to ensure traceability and consumer safety.
 
An animal husbandry bio therefore, intended for the human eating, by creating a range of products fond of good food, staying nevertheless within the reach of the biggest number.
 
For example, five locusts represent about 150 grammes of meats red, that is the equivalent of a steak.
The FAO (Food and Agriculture Organization), NGO admitted all over the world, says: «most eatable insect contains so many proteins as the meat or the fish and are even more nutritious when they are dried. Some insects are also rich in lipids, in vitamins or minerals.»
 
This very interesting feeding on a nutritional plan, contains besides, an important quantity of Chitosan, molecule used by the pharmaceutical laboratories to develop medicaments capable of struggling against the stocking of grease.
 
It is also necessary to lean over the environmental aspect of plan, indeed, always according to the FAO: «the course of study of animal husbandry would issue more gases with greenhouse effect than the sector of transport. She issues:
• 9 % worldwide carbon dioxide (CO2), because of the extension of the agricultural surfaces which destroys the forested surfaces.
• 37 % of methane coming from the digestive tract of ruminants.
• 65 % of hémioxyde of nitrogen, emanating from some manure, with a potential of total warming 296 times as high as CO2.
• 64 % ammonias, who contributes to acid rains.»
Leaving all these official reports, the attitude to be adopted from now on parried me clear: develop and democratise the entomophagie.
 
We already have several potential clients.
 
If Selkys and Co. Called the crowdfunding today, it is because we need you to implement this idea, to buy the equipment necessary for the animal husbandry of our insects and to prepare the assemblage of our first products.
We call you, rather than any bank, because he parried me éviedent that we all are concerned, for our future, and that of our children.
Help us to create feeding of tomorrow.
