Also titanium can be reused almost infinitely, a benefit that increases every time a titanium product is recycled.</p><p>The Splitter will use 100% recycled card for it packaging that is fully recyclable.

We are Full Windsor! We are a small outdoors brand driven by design, creativity and curiosity. This is our 5th kickstarter product launch. We have extensive experience, we have the manufacturing capabilities and we know what we are doing. Last year we released our Muncher titanium multi utensil on kickstarter, fulfilling every pledge to our 4553 wonderful backers with a product that then went on to be featured in Outside Magazine's 'Gear of the Year' 2018. Now stocked around the world by reputable retailers such as REI, the Muncher was a great success. We're now back on Kickstarter, with what we consider to be our best product yet - The Splitter titanium multi utensil.The joining mechanism for the tongs is a small stainless steel pin fixed to the spatula that inserts into a keyhole slot in the spork's end. The tongs use the titanium materials flex to operate at the perfect force. The spatula has a chamfered edge that allows it to get under the fiddliest of food morsels. It also features a serrated corner edge that allows it to cut into and check if food is cooked through whilst cooking. The long spork is perfect for getting into deep food packets and can be used as both a eating and serving utensil. When joined together into tongs the spatula can still be used to get under food and then the spork grips down onto the items to grasp them firmly. Its functionality makes it great for picking up all kinds of food.Both the spork and spatula feature a unique joining slot that allows the utensils to join together into a single compact unit when not in use. We have designed the connection so it is a simple click to separate the two utensils.We use the best!  Titanium is one of the most common metals found in nature. It is lightweight, strong, non-toxic and resistant to corrosion. Titanium is less heat-conductive than other metals, meaning it is safer to use when cooking. The Splitter uses aerospace grade 1mm sheet titanium. One millimetre might sound thin, but once it is three dimensionally formed into shape, it is very rigid. The reduced thickness is vital for the material flex needed for the tongs to function just so. After many, many prototypes we have refined the form into everything it needs to be.Sustainability is at the heart of what we do. Titanium is one of the most beneficial metals to recycle because it can be reused again and again with virtually no loss of quality. It is cheaper and less environmentally dangerous to recycle titanium components into new materials than it is to mine fresh titanium from the earth. Also titanium can be reused almost infinitely, a benefit that increases every time a titanium product is recycled.The Splitter will use 100% recycled card for it packaging that is fully recyclable. This means no part of the product will ever need to end up as landfill. This is very important to all of us at Full Windsor!The long spork allows you to get right to the bottom of deep food packets to get every last morsel of food - YUM!!! We are all set up with our manufacturing partner who specializes in the manufacture of high-end titanium products and metal engineering.

DARTER is beautifully machined from aluminium and brass in our East London workshop.Our pen and sewing kit really is this tiny. The internal sewing kit is just ¼” in diameter (6.3mm)
 
 
 We have 4 options to choose from: all silver, all gold, silver with gold trim, and gold with silver trim. The silver is made from aluminium and the gold is made from brass. Every part is machined from a solid rod of aluminium and brass. There are no plastic parts.Why did we put a sewing kit in a pen? Our answer is: because we can.  Our cutting-edge ""Swiss Turn"" machinery and team can cut parts smaller and with more precision than most CNC workshops. At first, our intention was to make the world's smallest refillable pen. Early on, however, we noticed that our designs had wasted space between the refill and the outer sleeve.  
At ornisi, we pride ourselves on finding ways of utilising even the tiniest space.
  
We spent a long time designing this striking button feature on the back of our pens. Each button is machined and drilled from a solid metal bar.Our passion is making small, useful tools. At the design stage, every line and every detail are considered as we try and maximise functionality. Our speciality is in adding useful features into everyday miniature objects. Only when the design is complemented do we add these features, but never at the expense of beautiful simple lines. After much research, we felt that the perfect addition to the empty space in our pen would be a small selection of thread and sewing needles.  
Our machine and team work at rapid speeds. This shows a small sample of 3 days of work dialling in the machine. Everything fits perfectly.At first, we thought it impossible to machine a sewing kit so small that it would fit within this space. Any additional thickness to the pen would have been a deal breaker. Finally, following an intensive month of machining and testing (and the breaking of a few of our tiniest drills), the world's smallest sewing kit was born. Each sewing kit can hold 4 needles and 2 small lengths of thread.
 Every part of this pen has been meticulously designed. With its 4 dummy holes, the selector knob has been made to look like a button.
 
The Design Brief   1. The DARTER pen had to be small - really small. So small, in fact, that it could be added to your keychain and go unnoticed. It needed to be no larger than a door key.  It was crucial that the DARTER was not uncomfortable in your pocket, and so we set the diameter of the pen to 7.5mm and its length to 58mm. Our Swiss turn CNC machine with 4m bar feeder. It can be loaded with multiple lengths of material and left to run for days on end. When we go home, it keeps working.2. The DARTER is made in-house in our East London workshop. If a feature in the design needed to be outsourced locally or overseas, we got rid of it. For us, it was essential that every part of this pen could be made using our own machinery and our own expertise. All our pens have a brass sewing kit hiding inside.We learnt a lot from 3Coil, our sister company, who launched a successful Kickstarter campaign. Working with factories that have 40 years of experience means we have a wealth of expertise and capabilities to tap into. This said, since these companies are such huge businesses, they have many departments and customers. Making a change or tweaking a design can take over a month for a simple revision.  But waiting around was no good for this project. At Ornisi, we are just as impatient as you. We don’t want to wait around. We want changes to happen in a few hours, not a few days or weeks. If we do have to make a revision, we want a shiny part in our hands by the end of the day.  To achieve this rapid prototyping solution, a different strategy to normal was needed. From Day 1, our creatives worked closely with our engineer. This meant that at the end of the design stage, this daily collaboration gave birth to an awesome product that not only looked and worked great, it could also be made on our machine by our engineer the very next day. All the colours of Darter.Incredibly, our time for prototyping has reduced from one month to less than one day. Our in-house manufacturing is up to 1000 parts per day. Our machines run 24/7.   
The DARTER pen is the perfect addition to any survival or every day carry kit3. It was important that our pen was refillable with a quality refill. Many pens on the market are either sealed and not refillable, or else use cheap refills that dry out quickly. A non-refillable pen is very wasteful. We wanted a pen which could both write well, and which would last a lifetime. Therefore, because of their quality and size, we decided to use Cross matrix ballpoint refills. All our pens ship with black ink. 
 The DARTER pen and sewing kit is always with you, so you can repair while you are out and about4. The DARTER pen doesn’t need to carry metres of thread – just enough for emergency wardrobe malfunctions. Our kit carries the right amount needed for ‘on the go’ repairs. Each pen contains a single bobbin, holding 1 meter of threadThis said, sometimes a job may require an extra-long piece of thread for a larger emergency repair. The DARTER can also be used in this situation.  
All our needles are No.10 Gold Eye Sharps needles – though small, they are tough and get the job done. Why do we manufacture in-house?     We produce beautiful turned parts in rapid time. Our expert team, from designers to our engineer and machinist, produce amazing results. Believe us when we say we can turn an idea or a sketch into a production part within 48 hours.  It can be frustrating for both our team and our backers to have to wait weeks, even months, for things to happen in our manufacturing partners’ factories. But by making this ourselves, the momentum never diminishes. Plus, we can share this amazing journey with you – you can even see your pen being made through a webcam inside our machine. Should we need to make any changes or overcome any obstacles you can watch us fix the problem in real time. Specification

<p>As the saying goes, this isn't our first rodeo! We've had several successful Kickstarter &amp; Indiegogo campaigns and an entire fulfillment team at our disposal to help get the rewards out in a timely fashion. We are manufacturing the BitzBlade 2.0 with the same factory that currently produces many of our top selling products such as the TriTac EDC Tactical Pens &amp; Pocket Samurai Keychain Knives. We are very confident in the quality of their work and ability to produce on schedule.</p>

Due to popular demand we also introduced a removable pocket clip stretch goal which we've met! You can also carry the BitzBlade in the included heavy duty nylon pouch which will hold the BitzBlade, additional 8 double sided bits and the remaining two interchangeable tools/blades. 


















 If you wanted another carry option you can purchase the additional Black or Carbon Fiber handmade kydex sheath which allows you to comfortably carry the BitzBlade 2.0 on your belt. There's nothing like the sound and feel when you ""snap"" the BitzBlade 2.0 into the custom molded kydex sheath.



As the saying goes, this isn't our first rodeo! We've had several successful Kickstarter & Indiegogo campaigns and an entire fulfillment team at our disposal to help get the rewards out in a timely fashion. We are manufacturing the BitzBlade 2.0 with the same factory that currently produces many of our top selling products such as the TriTac EDC Tactical Pens & Pocket Samurai Keychain Knives. We are very confident in the quality of their work and ability to produce on schedule.
Here are some quotes from backers of our previous Kickstarter campaigns:

<p><u><strong>Frequently Asked Questions</strong></u></p>
<p><strong>How is Qubix different from other packing cubes available on the market?</strong><br/>The main 3 differences are the super sturdy build (durable fabric + double stitching at the seams), the double compression and the folding board that makes packing super quick and easy.</p> <p><strong>What material is Qubix made from?</strong><br/>The Qubix fabric is antibacterial, water-resistant heathered polyester. It’s super easy to maintain and has very high endurance capability over time.</p> <p><strong>How do I care for my Qubix?</strong><br/>Qubix only requires a bit of occasional care. You can easily wipe dirt or dust from its surface. For a more thorough clean:</p>
<ul>
<li>Machine or hand wash cold</li>
<li>Air dry</li>
<li>Iron while still damp using low or medium heat</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Is there a warranty for Qubix?</strong><br/>Every item in the Qubix family is thoroughly inspected for quality assurance before your pledge is packaged to leave the factory. If you nonetheless receive a damaged item, simply send us a picture of the damage the minute you receive the package and we will replace it for you at no additional charge.</p> <p><strong>What size should my luggage be to fit the packing cubes?</strong><br/>Qubix fits perfectly into all kind of luggage sizes. For a shorter trip, you can even fit the small and medium cubes into your backpack for a neat, lightweight trip.</p> <p><strong>How does the compression zipper work?</strong><br/>The middle zipper is the compression one. When it’s unzipped, the cube is fully expanded and gives you maximum packing capacity. After you close the lid, you can compress the bag in 2 stages using the compression zipper, which wraps around your Qubix twice for increased flexibility. This brings together the top and bottom of the bag, gradually flattening out the cube content and reducing by up to 66% the space your stacked clothes would otherwise take.</p> <p><strong>What kind of zippers do you use for Qubix?</strong><br/>All the pieces included in the Qubix family come with YKK zippers as a standard.</p> <p><strong>Do I have to pay VAT/tax when I receive my Qubix?</strong><br/>Qubix ships globally and duties/taxes are different in each country. Because of that, we can’t retain additional duties/VAT in a way that’s accurate and fair for every backer. Any duties/VAT are the backer’s responsibility. If any duties apply, these may be charged at the time of receiving the package. To check whether or not there are duties/VAT charges for your reward in your country, please contact your local post office.</p>

Need we go on?... Whether you’re a frequent traveller or you just enjoy occasional city breaks, space is a luxury and packing in a light, neat, space-efficient way is as challenging as a mental ninja warrior obstacle course.Ok maybe not that much, but you get the picture. THE SOLUTION Qubix is the minimalist solution you've been waiting for. It doesn't just solve all the problems current packing cubes have, it also compliments any type of luggage so you can now travel in style.  Let's look at what makes your Qubix so amazingly #worthit:  We’re frequent travellers ourselves...So we understand all too well the stress of fitting travel essentials in the limited space of a carry-on or check-in luggage.Qubix gives you the perfect solution for neat, lightweight luggage that allows you to pack more and save space.  Your Qubix center compression zipper wraps twice around each cube, giving you the added flexibility of a 2 level compression.No more dealing with the stress of your packing cubes not compressing or falling apart when fully compressed.Qubix allows you to pack as much or as little as you want or need.  Keeping your luggage organised, compact and lightweight while saving up to 66% more space?You better believe it!With your new Qubix family, you can trust this isn’t just a possibility - it’s a given!  Have you ever looked outside the window from your airplane seat?If so, then you must have felt your heart sink at the sight of your luggage being thrown around during loading or unloading from the airplane.Without a compression cube, your clothes shift around and you arrive at your destination with a mess resembling the closet of a 3 year old in charge of organising their own wardrobe.Trust Qubix to guarantee your clothes will travel neatly, no matter the abuse your luggage goes through during the epic wrestling sessions with the baggage handlers.  Let's put this one into context. The clothes you see in the picture above belong to a big guy. Think 6.3 ft (190 cm) muscular dude who loves cake.Those, my friend, are really large clothes and your large Qubix can fit well over a weeks' worth of them.By comparison, the cake loving guy’s girlfriend is your regular next door girl. Not too tall, not too short, not too skinny… you get the picture.While the large Qubix fits a week's worth of the big guy’s wardrobe, we could fit 18 of his girlfriend’s everyday clothing items into that same cube and compressed it fully - no sweat!And we didn’t cheat at all. Among those 18 clothes there are no underwear items or socks. That’s what your small Qubix is for!#QUBIXISAMAZING  Take a close look at the zippers on your clothes. Chances are you'll find the letters ""YKK,"" on a lot or all of them.These babies are on everything from jeans, to coats, to sleeping bags.That’s because they have an unrivalled global reputation for impressive construction and reliability.Your Qubix zippers are corrosion resistant, super durable and guaranteed to work seamlessly for donky years (actual measure of time).And because they are the real deal, your entire Qubix family comes with YKK zippers as a standard.  If you’ve used packing cubes before, you know most either pull apart like butter or are very flimsy. Or quite likely, both!Your pain has been our pain for years and years.Your Qubix family is reinforced with double-stitching at the seams and contour-tubing for extra durability you can truly rely on.We’ve been stress-testing it (like seriously overstuffing it, on purpose!) for the past 6 months and wow do they hold up. Think the 'Bruce Lee' of packing cubes.From London to Amsterdam to Budapest to Bali to Shanghai to Hong Kong and not a single sign of the cubes buckling under immense pressure!   If we had a penny for every time we had to iron clothes after a flight…We'd probably have about a thousand pennies, what's that, about 10 bucks? Ok, it might not be a lot of money, but you get the gist :)Would you want to go out and about looking like you just pulled your shirt or dress out of your a$$?.. Didn’t think so!Your folding board helps you pack your clothes neatly and in the exact dimensions of your medium size Qubix. Simply fold and stack your shirts or dresses in the cube, then place the board on top before zipping up and compressing.And did we mention?.. The antibacterial treatment ensures longevity of the fabric and keeps your clothes bacteria and odour free.    Emma here is a petite girl who’s never lifted a dumbbell in her life!And she’s compressing a fully stuffed large Qubix.Do you see her struggle at all?That’s because compressing with Qubix doesn’t require any elbow grease. None! All you need is a drop of determination and the super durable Qubix family.  Let’s be honest here: most packing cubes are unattractive - to say the least.Qubix is a real sight for sore eyes.It’s not even us saying this.Reactions from other fellow travellers seeing Qubix is consistently along the lines of:“Oh man, your luggage is neat” - Jess (New Zealand)“Wow, I need to get me a set of these.” - Bud (USA)“#worthit” - Kadek (Indonesia)“Waaaaaay better than those flimsy things I buy at Bentley! Bring them on!!!!” - Mary Anne (USA)“Well dang, these cubes are a sight for sore eyes” - Lola (Australia)  
  To sum up Qubix in just one sentence…It’s your amazing-value-for-money family that does its job perfectly and helps you travel neater for many years to come.#YOU'REWELCOME :) 
 
    
 

 
 
  
Frequently Asked Questions
How is Qubix different from other packing cubes available on the market?The main 3 differences are the super sturdy build (durable fabric + double stitching at the seams), the double compression and the folding board that makes packing super quick and easy. What material is Qubix made from?The Qubix fabric is antibacterial, water-resistant heathered polyester. It’s super easy to maintain and has very high endurance capability over time. How do I care for my Qubix?Qubix only requires a bit of occasional care. You can easily wipe dirt or dust from its surface. For a more thorough clean:

Machine or hand wash cold
Air dry
Iron while still damp using low or medium heat

Is there a warranty for Qubix?Every item in the Qubix family is thoroughly inspected for quality assurance before your pledge is packaged to leave the factory. If you nonetheless receive a damaged item, simply send us a picture of the damage the minute you receive the package and we will replace it for you at no additional charge. What size should my luggage be to fit the packing cubes?Qubix fits perfectly into all kind of luggage sizes. For a shorter trip, you can even fit the small and medium cubes into your backpack for a neat, lightweight trip. How does the compression zipper work?The middle zipper is the compression one. When it’s unzipped, the cube is fully expanded and gives you maximum packing capacity. After you close the lid, you can compress the bag in 2 stages using the compression zipper, which wraps around your Qubix twice for increased flexibility. This brings together the top and bottom of the bag, gradually flattening out the cube content and reducing by up to 66% the space your stacked clothes would otherwise take. What kind of zippers do you use for Qubix?All the pieces included in the Qubix family come with YKK zippers as a standard. Do I have to pay VAT/tax when I receive my Qubix?Qubix ships globally and duties/taxes are different in each country. Because of that, we can’t retain additional duties/VAT in a way that’s accurate and fair for every backer. Any duties/VAT are the backer’s responsibility. If any duties apply, these may be charged at the time of receiving the package. To check whether or not there are duties/VAT charges for your reward in your country, please contact your local post office.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>This summer camp in the East Lake neighborhood will be held in the East Lake Courts Recreation and Community Center every week beginning May 28 from Tues-Sat (9a - 5p).  This camp is named in honor of Ms. Lawrence (pictured above), a longtime resident of East Lake Courts, who started the camp about 10 years ago as a way to create a safe and fun place for kids to go during summer break.</p>
<p>Ms. Lawrence has experienced several health challenges in the last few months and as a result, Grove Street Settlement House has stepped up to provide technical assistance along with other community groups to ensure this camp will open on May 28th until August 7th and then transition to an after-school program.  This day camp will serve approximately 40 kids between the ages of 5 and 11 and is provided FREE OF CHARGE.  The mornings will be spent strengthening math and writing skills; reading skills will be addressed through the ALEXIA computer-based reading program.  In the afternoons, every week will have a different focus (arts &amp; crafts, VBS, drama/performance, etc).  Because East Lake is situated in a vast food desert with no grocery stores close by,  a large community garden is being installed in May and the children/volunteers/community residents will manage the garden all summer and share in the produce grown. </p>
<p>A healthy breakfast and lunch are being provided to all children who enroll; a snack will also be offered in the afternoon.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
We are hoping to raise at least $2500 initially.  These funds will be used to buy supplies for the camp (paper, markers, glue, etc.).  We are also hoping to take the kids on at least two field trips (Hunter Museum and Nature Center) - field trips require renting a bus, providing lunch, etc.  If we raise enough money, we would also like to pay a small stipend to 2-4 graduate students to serve as facilitators of the camp throughout the summer.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>
<strong>**It will only take 88 people contributing $25 each or 44 people contributing $50 each to meet our goal!</strong>** </div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
Ms. Lawrence's East Lake Summer Camp will provide a fun, safe, and educational option for children and their families.  For many families in low-income communities, affordable and accessible summer camp options are very limited.  This camp provides one no-cost resource for this neighborhood and reduces the number of young people with no focused or positive activity to engage in over the summer months.  Low-income children between the ages of 5 and 11 will directly benefit from this camp.  Indirect benefits are the reinforcement of basic math, reading, and literacy skills.  More direct benefits are to create a positive and fun place for children and their caregivers to participate in - one goal for the camp is to increase parental involvement over the course of the summer.  For the larger community, neighborhood safety is a citywide concern - this camp addresses one aspect of this concern.</div>
<div>
<h3>Volunteer! </h3>
<p>The camp needs volunteers in 3 hour blocks of time - if you can help or if your church or civic group is interested, visit our Facebook page for more details.  Search for ""Ms. Lawrence's East Lake Summer Camp"" on Facebook.</p>
<h3>Who We Are</h3>
Grove Street has been involved with several community-based initiatives during the past year - our goal is to provide the technical assistance and support to help community groups start a project.  We then transition out so the community group has full ownership of the project.  Common Ground Free Store is an example of how we work in the community.  We are intentional about creating a space where a variety of individuals, groups, and organizations can come together around a shared cause or concern. </div></div>","Short Summary

<p>You will create a chapter in History today by getting involved in USAECR.</p>
<p>Sal Di Stefano and Vince Torrusio are the founders of USA Emergency Crisis Relief (USAECR). With over 25+ years of marketing, business strategy, professional sales strategy and business operating experience.</p>

One of the biggest complaints we have heard is so much of a donated dollar is used before the funds donated actually reach and serve the mission.</p>

<p>THANK YOU! for YOUR HELP in Making a Difference!</p>
<p><em>Crisis Today, Respond Today, Action Today</em></p>
<h3>** What We Need &amp; What You Get **</h3>
<div>
<p>USAECR needs $25,000 in funding to launch the national charity. The funding is going to build the online community interactive web site that will be the hub for natiional action, correspondence and events as they occur along with typical legal, accounting, public relations, SEO and other fees associated with any startup charity.  </p>
<p>What is unique about USAECR national website is that it will:</p>
<ol>
<li>Give Donors control on where their donation goes. For example: Which crisis situtation do you want to donate to and it will keep you the donor abreast on funds raised and how those funds are being utillized. It will also give donors the option to choose funding for food, clothing, housing, medical and community first responders.</li>
<li>The web page will allow community businesses in those areas to get involved in and make it known that they want to get involved and help by making their services available. There will be a link to these services and community support.</li>
<li>For the first time in History volunteers can create their own FaceBook pages linking and supporting funds needed for current crisis situations via USAECR and will give volunteers the opportunity to become national Operation Managers; ownership and community action.</li>
<li>Twitter and Facebook will be displayed giving the US community freedom to express their concerns and help...and much more.</li>
</ol>
<p>If we do not reach the desired $25,000, the remaing difference will be made up by contacting and appealing to individual corporate donors etc, until all the funds are acquired to launch.</p>
</div>
<h3>*** The Impact ***</h3>
<p>* Your contribution is HISTORICAL. By helping USAECR you are helping change the way people get help, NOW. Your donation will begin a legacy of a new era in online giving that is focused on no beaucratic red tape, elaborate administration fees, but rather focus on Immediate help and specifically helping people who need immediate attention.</p>
<p>* We have done extensive research on charities and most charities have enormous administration cost, large payrolls and costly operating fees. USAECR is about community, people helping people, and by minimizing all cost, such as not having an office, our volunteers will work mobile or from home, not having expense accounts, you can be asssured that we are here to do one thing, give immediate help, swiflty, and quickly without wasted dollars going to administration cost, but to the MISSION.</p>
<p>* A charity with a heart! We want to change the way people are helped by giving them the most help they need. In many situations ""immediate"" housing, food, medical care is needed. Who is better to do that, than the first responders to those crisis situations and the community that serves them.</p>
<p>* This will change the way people get help fast, efficiently and precise. We are successful at making things happen and we believe we can help our community and people who need help in these unfortunate events. We may be helping you someday, too.</p>

Hi there! I'm Django!



And these are my humans! Mayra and Fernando.

My humans decided to pursue their dream of becoming professional photographers and opened up their own business, Lightbug Studio. I have watched them work very late nights and make great sacrifices to keep their dream alive. 
My humans need a little boost right now to continue making awesome and creative photos and videos. Our mortgage payment is due Feb. 15th and your donation will help us stay in our home, pay some bills and give us a chance to keep working towards our dream job.
My humans are so dedicated and willing to sacrifice anything to achieve their goals, even the place where I grew up in and still LOVE. 
#SaveDjangosHouse

Here’s some photos of me and my humans.
This is when I first arrived at my house. I found out there was a park nearby and I LOVED it even more!

I loved my new home and my humans took good care of me.

They even taught me some tricks that I still know!
Here's the video
I started growing and growing and discovering life. My humans even made me an Instagram account: http://instagram.com/djangothelab




My humans sing me Happy Birthday

And of course I learned to do my own works of art, but my humans didn’t really like this.
 I call this the Couch Bone. 

This I call Snow in Summer.



This isn't art, I was just exfoliating my beautiful skin.



How awesome, right? So this is my family and some of my adventures. Please help us so I can keep my house and my backyard.#SaveDjangosHouse

The splash-proof fabric of The Pouch protects your mask from raindrops or light spills.
Versatile and made to last, The Pouch can also be used to fit other essentials such as key card, passport, or medicine. Comes in 4 different color options.  
 



 

 
To clean, machine wash on cold or hand wash with mild soapy water and hang dry. Make sure do not use tumble dry, do to not iron, bleach, or use fabric softener. Tip: If you’re in a rush, simply wipe down the pouch with alcohol wipes for a quick refresh! 
 



 
 

A handy, pocket-size Touch-Pen to reduce potentially unsafe contacts when you're in the elevator; using the ATM or public touch screens; or filling out paper forms. Comes with a keychain ring to easily attach with your keys.

 

 
 

 

 
Our refill bottle has a slim design made to fit any pant pocket with ease. Comes with a detachable carabiner in case you’d like to hang it out for convenient access. Simply unscrew the cap to refill it with the hand sanitizer gel of your choice. Note: sanitizer gel not included.

When children in Congo (gold) need medical and dietary assistance, language should not be a hindrance to selflessly helping them.

When you want to go to the toilet in a strange city but no one responds, language should not be your obstacle.</p>

<p>""Jehovah scattered them from there over all the surface of the earth, and they gradually left off building the city. That is why its name was called Babel, because there Jehovah had confused the language of all the earth."" - Genesis 11:8, 9 </p>
<h3><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1550606264/wmlgcsyejrqvaa7bj594.png"" src="""" style=""float: center;""/></h3>
<p>The narrative of Tower of Babel explained that God was concerned that humans are disrespectful towards God by building the tower to escape the impossibility thoughts of living in God-creation world. Thus, God brought in the existence of different language to the world and scattered the people around the world so they were unable to understand one another. </p>
<p>However, for thousands years until now, humans are still searching for a better way to communicate and understand each other.</p>
<p>As we can see, the world is filled with pain. If only language barrier isn't the problem, the world could perhaps not have any war. People will live peacefully without any miscommunication because miscommunication leads to a lot conflicts. If only people around the world speak the same language, the world will be different. More positivity, less negativity, this will be the dream of the world.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1550606318/tb9mss6pwhkw9trvtxuu.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Before the 21st century, people solved this problem by studying each and every language. Interpreters that are experts in the languages are hired to translate. However, this is not effective enough for people since the World has all kinds of languages. Plus, humans has limited capabilities and limited time to learn every language spoken in the world.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1550606375/euu3acgexxj4h62ujlny.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>As technology gets better in these recent years, Artificial Intelligence(AI) is introduced in the interpretation industry. AI now can outnumber human in many ways when it comes to languages.   </p>
<p>What makes us being determined to do this project was because a friend came on June 6th, 2015; and talked about traveling abroad. During their conversation, he commented that traveling abroad has become much more convenient because there are more international flights with a lower price, and traveling visa is easier to get.  </p>
<p>We were feeling very excited but then a question arose,  </p>
<p>""How did you communicate with foreigners when traveling abroad?""  </p>
<p>The conversation fell into a total silence.  </p>
<p>My friend admitted that he felt embarrassed and it wasn't so convenient when he was traveling abroad. Although he had a great time, there are also times because he wasn't able to communicate. He also joked that he had trouble approaching some ladies but gave up due to language problems.  </p>
<p>To cut the long story short, the conversation made us realize about the importance of language. Thus, the idea is approved by our friends. So we proceed to the development of the first generation of Mesay translation device. </p>

</div></div>","MESAY3's mission is simple – make the world a better place by turn the world's greatest travelers into great communicators. Language should never be a hindrance to travelers, it is time to travel to the local culture with MESAY3.

During a global travelling, the most interesting thing is always not the local scenery, but the treasures of culture and interesting locals. With MESAY3, you can say 50 languages at once, easily surpassed all the language masters in the world. 

I bet the most difficult for you to forget will be the local unfamiliar faces which are extremely surprised when MESAY3 speaking.

With the experience of the first two generations of products, the new MESAY3 is now cheaper, smarter, more accurate and also has longer battery life and support more languages. What's more, we have made great efforts to improve the user interaction experience, and now the product is more user-friendly and even more elegant.

In addition, you will not be easily deceived, and you can complete in-depth travel with no one but MESAY3.There’s no doubt that a MESAY3 cloud make your trip safer, more free, and more cost-effective.
 
 

 
 

Introducing MESAY3, the third generation of the powerful AI translator from the MESAY brand, now custom-tailored for travelers. Press the button and talk to it in your native language, MESAY 3 will translate every words it hears into the target languages in 0.8 sencond with 97% accuracy.
Let's meet the first two generations:

The first generation - MESAY 1 -support 15 languages translation to Chinese or English

The 2nd generation - MESAY 2 -support 16 languages back-to-back translation.
Thanks to the supporters of the previous two generations. Without them, there is no MESAY3. After making the first two generations of products, we received feedback from many users, and some questions became the reason why we continue to improve our products.

After one year‘s hard work, MESAY 3 was born, as a better translator and a completely different device. Now MESAY3 support 50 languages back-to-back translation, with the largest 2.3 inch LCD touch screen but even more affordable.

From appearance to software, from design concept to the applicable crowd, it has been redesigned. Advances in AI technology and producing tech have resulted in a slim and beautiful body and a higher price/performance ratio.

If the first two generations are clumsy toddlers and young girls, then MESAY3 is a truly elegant adult woman. 
Check in the features to know more.
 
 

 

As the title says, MESAY3 is a device designed for travelers. In our opinion, language should never be an obstacle to your communication with the world.

When Cristiano Ronaldo plays a wonderful hat trick at the World Cup in Russia, the language should not be a hindrance to cheering and shouting at the scene. When children in Congo (gold) need medical and dietary assistance, language should not be a hindrance to selflessly helping them. When a reporter is discriminated against in another country, language barrier should not be his dangerous sign. When you want to go to the toilet in a strange city but no one responds, language should not be your obstacle.


Now, with MESAY3, shopping, ordering, asking for directions and buying tickets will not give you a headache when your interpreter is absent. 

An in-depth exchange can also be made. In China, old men always have a passionate heart on the streets, beautiful girls have the expectation of being approached by foreigners, young people may wish to make foreign friends like you. See what you missed!

With MESAY3, you will discover how boring it is to only see the scenery. 

Is MESAY3 in your package list now?

Supports translation of each two of the following languages.



 

 

 

 
""Jehovah scattered them from there over all the surface of the earth, and they gradually left off building the city. That is why its name was called Babel, because there Jehovah had confused the language of all the earth."" - Genesis 11:8, 9 

The narrative of Tower of Babel explained that God was concerned that humans are disrespectful towards God by building the tower to escape the impossibility thoughts of living in God-creation world. Thus, God brought in the existence of different language to the world and scattered the people around the world so they were unable to understand one another. 
However, for thousands years until now, humans are still searching for a better way to communicate and understand each other.
As we can see, the world is filled with pain. If only language barrier isn't the problem, the world could perhaps not have any war. People will live peacefully without any miscommunication because miscommunication leads to a lot conflicts. If only people around the world speak the same language, the world will be different. More positivity, less negativity, this will be the dream of the world.

Before the 21st century, people solved this problem by studying each and every language. Interpreters that are experts in the languages are hired to translate. However, this is not effective enough for people since the World has all kinds of languages. Plus, humans has limited capabilities and limited time to learn every language spoken in the world.

As technology gets better in these recent years, Artificial Intelligence(AI) is introduced in the interpretation industry. AI now can outnumber human in many ways when it comes to languages.   
What makes us being determined to do this project was because a friend came on June 6th, 2015; and talked about traveling abroad. During their conversation, he commented that traveling abroad has become much more convenient because there are more international flights with a lower price, and traveling visa is easier to get.  
We were feeling very excited but then a question arose,  
""How did you communicate with foreigners when traveling abroad?""  
The conversation fell into a total silence.  
My friend admitted that he felt embarrassed and it wasn't so convenient when he was traveling abroad. Although he had a great time, there are also times because he wasn't able to communicate. He also joked that he had trouble approaching some ladies but gave up due to language problems.  
To cut the long story short, the conversation made us realize about the importance of language. Thus, the idea is approved by our friends. So we proceed to the development of the first generation of Mesay translation device.

<p><b><i>What is the power consumption?</i></b></p>
<p>The iCam HD uses only 2Amps/5Volts of power and therefore can be powered by using only a battery bank.  This ultra low power consumption guarantees that it will never overheat and possibly cause a fire in your home.</p>

<p>You can record locally on the MicroSD card (up to 32GB) or link your Google Drive account for instant cloud upload.  Be sure to put a MicroSD in the back of the iCam as this a requirement to record any videos.</p>
<p>You can also choose which quality you would like to record at and the method for upload (continuous, event triggered, or disabled) </p>

<p><i><i><b>What is the quality of the video?</b></i></i></p>
<p>The quality comes in HD, VGA or QVGA.</p>
<p>For recorded videos it depends on what quality you want the camera to use. This can easily be changed in the settings menu.</p>
<p>For the live viewing, the camera will automatically select the most appropriate quality based on your wifi bandwidth availability.  It will also adjust the quality to make sure the connection is stable and has minimal delay. </p>

</div></div>","This holiday season Amaryllo International is offering one of the most unique gift ideas around.  





Christmas is the time of year when we get together with family and friends to celebrate the love and compassion for each other.  Amaryllo would like to offer this feeling of closeness and security all year round.  
When you give a gift from Amaryllo, you are passing on the quality, comfort and dedication that goes into each product. 
The iCam HD gives you the peace of mind that your home and loved ones are always just a touch away.




Amaryllo wins 2015 CES Best of Innovation Award!!

Amaryllo International has just received one of the most prestigous awards given by the Consumer Electronics Association (CEA), producer of the Consumer Electronics Show (CES), the world's largest electronics show that takes place every year in Las Vegas, Nevada.


There are two tiers to the Innovation awards given by the CEA at CES.  The first is ""Honoree"".  Over 100 products were chosen as an honoree from 28 different product categories.
However, only the products that score the highest, AND above the required score, are awarded the ""Best of Innovation"".  This year 20 products were able to acheive the required score and receive this highest honor.
Amaryllo was chosen for the Best of Innovation award in the category of ""Embedded Technology"", beating out major companies like Samsung and Qualcomm.
We welcome you to come share the enjoyment with us this coming January 6-9 at CES in Las Vegas.   Our products will be on display at the Best of Innovation Awards Showcase, located in the Sands Expo at CES Tech West. You can find the Amaryllo booth also in the Sands Expo booth #70048




We are offering amazing deals on 2 models of the iCam HD exclusively during this holiday season!




And the crowd favorite iSensor!



This is NOT a fundraising campaign! 
It is an exclusive 'presale' event.






Back by popular demand, now in Christmas version!

We are offering FREE 4GB MicroSD cards to the first 100 Snow Cube and the first 100 Santa's Special orders.




When the campaign funds reach $10,000 we will give EVERYONE a FREE MicroSD card upgrade!*
Everyone who didn't pledge to get a MicroSD card before will now receive a 4GB MicroSD card; everyone who already got a 4GB MicroSD card will now get a 8GB MicroSD card; the 8GB will be upgraded to a 16GB MicroSD card!Merry Christmas!*Since the iChristmas has built in memory this does not apply for the iChristmas.


We are always looking for new ways to improve and lately Amaryllo has been working with Google to integrate innovative technologies into all its products.



Amaryllo is the first IP camera to integrate Google's browser-based real time communication service.  WebRTC offers extremely stable audio and video streaming without the need of downloading software add-ons or plug-ins.  Recent News:
1. http://www.webrtc-solutions.com/topics/webrtc-solutions/articles/389356-amsterdam-based-company-reveals-first-webrtc-wireless-network.htm
2. http://blog.peer5.com/webrtc-the-future-of-the-web/
3. http://www.webrtcworld.com/topics/webrtc-world/articles/391226-amaryllo-announces-new-camera-line-with-webrtc-functionality.htm



       Amaryllo is the first company to offer free cloud storage to consumers.  Through the iCam application, you can link your Google Drive with your camera.  Although the video is stored in your drive, you can manage and access them right through the app.  This saves you time and energy when searching for your video.  







Up to 1080x720 HD resolution gives you a crisp and clear look at what's going on.



Every Google account gives you 15GB free.  Link your iCam HD with your Google Drive and record every moment in HD quality.


Sometimes you want privacy and now it's easier than ever.  No need to power off your camera or unplug it anymore.



With the use of Google WebRTC, you can enjoy true 2-way audio in real time, not a push-to-talk method like most other IP cameras. *not included for the iChristmas


Simply add songs onto the MiscroSD card and through the app you can play, shuffle, and repeat you favorite songs or lullabies.
*only available with the Snow Cube
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iodfyRDzGgI


Day or night, you'll never miss a moment.  However, the IR LED can be disabled in the settings if you are concerned about the harmful radiation they emit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gF5fOjMEf0
*Not available on the iChristmas





1. Where can I find more information on the products?
Click on the camera for more information

You could also go to http://crowdfundingcast.tk/crowdfunding-cast-ep... to listen to our interview. 


How do I set it up?
The setup process takes only 1 minute if you know your WiFi password.  Our app will guide you through the steps and with a simple QR code scan, the camera is up and working. Here are the instruction videos.
Snow Cube and Santa's Special 


iChristmas




Will I or the gifted receive it before Christmas?
Rest assured that you will get all your perks in time, we will start shipping at the beginning of December.
We already have the packaging ready and we are beginning to stock our inventory.
Shipping will be done on a first pledged first send basis. To make this as smooth as possible we would like you to go to our website after you pledge. There you can enter your shipping information and will receive a shipping number.
This way we can start forwarding your information to our carrier to start processing.

How good is the ""Night Vision""?*
Here is a video of the night vision as recorded by the iCam HD, the wall is about 3 meters away (the tiles on the floor are 1 meter each).  At up to 5 meters, objects are highly detailed, however you can still objects at 10 meters with less detail.




*The iChristmas does not support Night Vision, instead it has a high power flashlight




What is the power consumption?
The iCam HD uses only 2Amps/5Volts of power and therefore can be powered by using only a battery bank.  This ultra low power consumption guarantees that it will never overheat and possibly cause a fire in your home.


Do I need to download an application?
Yes, you will need to download the iCam HD 360 app (for Santa's Special and the Snow Cubu) or the iSensor HD app (for the iChristmas).
 or  They are available for both Android and Apple devices. 
                      


Do I have to pay the import taxes?
No, we work together with TNT express to ensure all the import taxes that come with your shipment are being covered. 

Can I use it outdoors?
No, our products are not weatherproof.  If we were to make them weatherproof, then we would not be able to give this good of a deal.  Weatherproof cameras are easily a couple hundred dollars more than in-house IP cams.

How secure is the P2P connection?
With our 256 bit encryption and Google's security there is nothing to worry about.
And you can rest assured that something like this doesn't happen with our camera's.

Is there a warranty and user manual?
Yes, there is a paper and digital user manual, and a warranty on parts for one year after purchase.




How can I record my videos?
You can record locally on the MicroSD card (up to 32GB) or link your Google Drive account for instant cloud upload.  Be sure to put a MicroSD in the back of the iCam as this a requirement to record any videos.
You can also choose which quality you would like to record at and the method for upload (continuous, event triggered, or disabled) 





What is the quality of the video?
The quality comes in HD, VGA or QVGA.
For recorded videos it depends on what quality you want the camera to use. This can easily be changed in the settings menu.
For the live viewing, the camera will automatically select the most appropriate quality based on your wifi bandwidth availability.  It will also adjust the quality to make sure the connection is stable and has minimal delay. 
http://www.amaryllo.eu/n40822videodemo/


What kind of WiFi connection speed do I need?
Our Cameras have built-in WiFi 802.11 bgn and both downloading and uploading speeds depend on your available bandwidth.




How long can I record video?  










What is the quality of the speaker?*


*the iChristmas does not support 2 way audio

Can I mount it on the wall or ceiling?
Yes! The iChristmas can be mounted on the wall or ceiling anywhere in the house with the included bracket. 


Or plug it into a USB power adapter and make it cordless!


For the Snow Cube and the Santa's Special we work with a Danish company who makes an aftermarket mount for the ceiling or wall.  You can contact them for pricing and ordering at their website:
www.spaceclub.dk


          
           
            


       


Can the infrared light be turned off?*
Yes, in the app you can enable or disable the IR LED lights so that you don't expose your loved ones to any unnecessary radiation that may be harmful to their eyes. 



*Not available on the iChristmas

Throw it into your washing machine with colors whenever you need a fresh start.   Hi, I am Ned :)It all started a year ago. I was traveling to San Diego for the weekend with a traditional toiletry bag in tow. The sunscreen inside broke and it was such a mess; everything was smothered in greasy, white cream- even my toothbrush.Since I travel often, I set out to find the perfect bag that would prevent any future messy mishaps. During my research, I noticed that the market is full of those one-pocket chaotic traditional bags.After scouting out over fifty different toiletry bags, I realized that while a few had some neat features, none of them had it all. I thought to myself, I enjoy designing things and solving problems, so why not create the perfect travel bag?I collaborated with many of my friends who are also avid travelers to learn which bags they used, which features they liked, and what they found lacking. I partnered with a frequent traveler and art enthusiastic, Catherine. With all the input we received, we began to design our first prototype.Now I’ve just completed my first test trip with prototype #4, and it’s everything I had hoped for in a toiletry bag! Catherine also used it on her month-long California trip and she absolutely fell in love with it! Vacationist is the best travel bag you’ll ever need! We sent Vacationist to several travelers from different professions around the world - Project Manager, Graphic Designer, Realtor, Blogger, Student... From USA, Germany, Croatia, Brazil, Vietnam... They used Vacationist during their trips.

<p>The <strong>Jungle LUX</strong> will provide you the ultimate comfort experience. It has been designed to follow you in all your activities. This sole version is made from a mixture of cork and latex. Flexible and adaptable it can adjust to your unique foot impression. This natural dual layer sole not only supports, but cork is a naturally antibacterial material, which absorbs sweat and prevents odors, ensuring both hygiene and comfort. The LUX sole is covered with a soft leather hide (a Vegan option will also be available).

<h3>État d'avancement. Calendrier</h3>
<p>Nous avons produit notre modèle 3D dans Rhinoceros. Puis, avec l'aide de la société INPACT (Leiria, Portugal), nous avons imprimé plusieurs versions de notre design. INPACT fonctionne avec la dernière génération d'imprimante SLS 3DSystem. Nous avons sélectionné deux matériaux pour les impressions : le Duraform Flex et le Duraform TPU. Ces matériaux flexibles nous permettent de produire des prototypes qui imitent le produit final avec précision. Nous avons imprimé 3 prototypes avant de passer au premier moule d'injection.<br/><br/>Nous avons déjà produit 4 prototypes de moules d'injection et de compression nécessaires pour les deux versions de la Jungle. Un pour la semelle en caoutchouc de la version LUX, un pour la semelle complète LUX, un pour la mousse EVA de la version LIGHT et enfin un pour le corps extérieur qui est le même pour les deux versions de la jungle.<br/><br/>Pendant le déroulement de la campagne, nous continuons à travailler et à peaufiner les détails pour offrir à vos pieds le meilleur confort possible.<br/>Dès que l'objectif de la campagne sera atteint, nous lancerons la fabrication d'un groupe de moules pour une taille unique. <strong>Février 2018.</strong><br/>Après les derniers tests et ajustements, nous lancerons la production des moules pour toutes les autres tailles. <strong>Mars 2018.</strong><br/>Ensuite, nous allons produire toutes les paires de Jungle, les emballer et vous les expédier.<strong> Avril/Mai 2018.</strong></p>

<h3>
<br/>Barfuss Komfort überall</h3>
<p>Mit dem iGUANEYE Jungle...</p>
<ul>
<li>können Ihre Füße atmen, befreit von der Enge geschlossener Schuhe.</li>
<li>werden Ihre Füße gehalten, damit sie laufen, springen und sich frei bewegen können.</li>
<li>sind Ihre Füße geschützt, damit sie auch schwieriges Gelände bewältigen können.</li>
</ul>
<p>Der iGUANYE Jungle bietet mit ultra-minimalem Design, optimalen Schutz des Fußes. Er passt sich wie eine zweite Haut an und folgt all Ihren Bewegungen.</p>
<p>Ein Stück Ultraflex Elastomer hält nur die große Zehe und die Ferse des Fußes. Durch diesen Halt, wird die ergonomische Sohle fixiert und wie durch Magie: ES HÄLT ! <br/><br/>Der Jungle ist der komfortabelste Schuh aller Zeiten! Testen Sie das unglaubliche Barfußgefühl.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>2 austauschbare Varianten : der Jungle LUX und der Jungle LIGHT</h3>
<p>Der Jungle LUX bietet das ultimative Komfort Erlebnis. Er wurde designt, um Sie bei all Ihren Aktivitäten zu begleiten. Die Sohlenvariante ist ein Mix aus Kork und Latex. Flexibel und formbar, passt er sich an Ihren Fußabdruck an. Diese natürliche Kombination von Materialien in der Sohle sorgt nicht nur für Halt, sondern bietet mit dem integrierten Kork ein antibakterielles Material, das Schweiß und Gerüche aufsaugt. Die LUX Sohle ist mit weichem Leder überzogen (eine vegane Variante wird auch angeboten werden). Der Kunststoff an der Unterseite der Sohle bietet maximalen Schutz vor Abreibung.</p>
<p>Der Jungle LIGHT hat die gleiche Form wie die LUX Version, wird aber aus EVA Schaum erzeugt. Unglaublich leicht und wasserfest, mit weicher und komfortabler Passform. Die LIGHT Variante bietet den Vorteil auch Wasser oder starkem Regen zu trotzen.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>2 Teile, die wie ein 3D Puzzle zusammenpassen</h3>
<p>Das 3D Puzzle System gibt Ihnen die Möglichkeit die zwei Hauptteile mit unterschiedlichen Sohlen und Farben zu kombinieren und individuell zu gestalten. Die zwei Teile fügen sich leicht ineinander und lassen sich in wenigen Sekunden austauschen.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Inspiriert von indigenen Völkern des Amazonas</h3>
<p>Wie auch das erste Modell von iGUANEYE – den Freshoes – wurde der Jungle von Überlieferung von indigenen Völkern des Amazonas inspiriert. Diese haben ihre Füße in flüssigen Kautschuk getaucht, um sie zu schützen.</p>
<p>Wir haben versucht diese Erfahrung in Experimenten nachzustellen, und so wurden die iGUANEYE Freshoes geboren.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Unser erstes Modell – der Freshoes – ist ein voller Erfolg</h3>
<p>Seit unserer ersten Crowdfunding Kampagne, haben wir mehr als 20.000 Paar Freshoes auf der ganzen Welt verkauft.</p>
<p>Ob neugierig, experimentierfreudig oder Hardcore-Fan – wenn sie den Komfort den iGUANEYE bietet, erlebt haben, möchten Sie nicht mehr auf konventionelle Sandalen oder Flip-Flops wechseln.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>100% made in Porto, Portugal</h3>
<p>Wir sind stolz darauf unser Produkt zu 100% in der Nähe von Porto, im wunderschönen Norden von Portugal, zu erzeugen. Unsere Geschäftspartner sehen wir wie Familie, gemeinsam sind wir bestrebt, das beste Produkt zu erzeugen.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Wo stehen wir jetzt. Planung</h3>
<p>Wir haben bereits unser 3D Modell in Rhinoceros entworfen. Danach wurden mit Hilfe von INPACT (Leiria Portugal) mehrere Versionen unserer komplexen Prototypen produziert. INPACT arbeitet mit der neuesten Generation von 3D System SLS Druckern. Zwei Materialien wurden für die Prototypen gewählt: Duraform Flex und Duraform TPU. Diese flexiblen Materialien ermöglichen es uns mit Prototypen zu arbeiten, die das Endprodukt genau nachstellen. Es wurden drei Prototypen entwickelt, bevor wir die Spritzgussformen fertiggestellt haben.</p>
<p>Vier Spritzgussformen wurden bereits produziert, gemeinsam mit den zwei Formpressen für die unterschiedlichen Varianten des Jungle. Eine für die Kunststoff-Außensohle der LUX Version, eine für die komplette LUX Sohle, eine für die EVA Schaumsohle der LIGHT Version und schließlich eine Form für beide Außensohlen, die sowohl bei der LUX als auch bei der LIGHT Versionen zum Einsatz kommt.</p>
<p>Während die Kampagne läuft, arbeiten wir noch weiter an der Perfektion der Details, um Ihren Füßen die beste Passform zu bieten, die Sie je erlebt haben.</p>
<p>Sobald das Funding Ziel erreicht wird, werden wir an der Fertigstellung der Formen und dazugehörigen Größe für eines der Modelle arbeiten. <strong>Februar 2018.</strong><br/>Nach Abschlusstests und Anpassungen werden wir die Produktionsformen für alle anderen Größen fertig stellen. <strong>März 2018.</strong><br/>Danach gehen wir in den Produktionslauf der Jungle Paare, verpacken und versenden diese. <strong>April/Mai 2018.</strong></p>

""The breathability of sandals, but the foot-hugging security of a sneaker...footwear to their purest form""(Sneaker Freaker)""Step into the future"" (Mashable)

 
With the iGUANEYE Jungle......your feet breathe, freed from the tightness of closed shoes.
...your feet are held, so you can run, jump and do whatever you want.
...your feet are protected, so you can move on rough grounds.The iGUANEYE Jungle provides ultra-minimal foot protection. It acts like a second skin and follows all your movements.A piece of Ultraflex elastomer only wraps around your big toe and your heel. By doing so, it secures a thick ergonomic sole under your feet and just like magic : IT HOLDS !The Jungle is the most comfortable shoes ever ! Test the amazing feeling of barefoot comfort everywhere.
The Jungle LUX will provide you the ultimate comfort experience. It has been designed to follow you in all your activities. This sole version is made from a mixture of cork and latex. Flexible and adaptable it can adjust to your unique foot impression. This natural dual layer sole not only supports, but cork is a naturally antibacterial material, which absorbs sweat and prevents odors, ensuring both hygiene and comfort. The LUX sole is covered with a soft leather hide (a Vegan option will also be available). A rubber out-sole provides maximum resistance to abrasion.
The Jungle LIGHT version has exactly the same shape than the LUX version but it is made of EVA foam. Incredibly light and water-proof, it is also soft and super comfortable. The LIGHT version has the advantage to follow you even in water or when weather is rainy.
    
The 3D puzzle system allows to mix and match main body with sole types and colors. So you will be able to compose your own version. The two parts secure easily together. You can mount and dismount in seconds.
Like our first model (the Freshoes), the Jungle is inspired by the Amazonian Indians that used to dip their feet in liquid rubber from trees to protect them.
We have reproduced the experience and also dipped our feet in liquid rubber. That is how the iGUANEYE Freshoes were born.

Since our first crowdfunding campaign, we have sold more than 20.000 pairs of Freshoes all over the world...From curious to customer to addict, once you have tried the unique comfort that iGUANEYE brings you will never want to go back to conventional sandals or flip-flops.
 


We are proud to produce 100% of our product near Porto in the beautiful north of Portugal. We have very strong relations with our industrial partners. They are family and they are committed to producing the best quality product as much as we are.We have produced our 3D model in Rhinoceros 3D. Then with the help of INPACT (Leiria Portugal), we have printed several versions of our intricated design. INPACT works with the last generation of the 3DSystem SLS printer. We have selected two materials for the prints : Duraform Flex and Duraform TPU. Those flexible materials allow us to produce a prototype that mimic the final product accurately. We have printed 3 prototypes before we moved on to the first injection mold.We have already produced 4 prototype injection and compression molds needed for the two versions of the Jungle. One for the rubber outsole of the LUX version, one for the complete LUX sole, one for the EVA foam for LIGHT version of the sole and finally one for the outer body that is the same part for both versions of the Jungle.While the campaign is running we are still working and fine-tuning details to offer your feet the best fit they have ever experienced.As soon as the goal of the campaign is achieved, we will launch the tooling of one group of molds for one size. February 2018.After final testing and adjustments we will launch production of molds for all other sizes. March 2018.Then we will produce all the Jungle pairs, pack them and ship them to you. April/May 2018.

Inspirées par les Indiens d'Amazonie
Comme notre premier modèle (les Freshoes), la Jungle est inspirée par les Indiens d'Amazonie qui trempaient leurs pieds dans le caoutchouc liquide des arbres pour les protéger.Nous avons reproduit l'expérience et avons également trempé nos pieds dans du caoutchouc liquide. C'est ainsi que sont nés les iGUANEYE Freshoes.
 
Notre premier modèle, la Freshoes est un succès
Depuis notre première campagne de crowdfunding, nous avons vendu plus de 20.000 paires de Freshoes partout dans le monde ...De curieux à aficionados, une fois que vous avez essayé le confort unique qu'apporte iGUANEYE, vous ne voudrez plus jamais revenir aux sandales conventionnelles ou aux tongues.

Nous sommes fiers de produire 100% de nos produits près de Porto dans le nord du Portugal. Nous avons des relations très fortes avec nos partenaires industriels. Nous formons une famille et ils s'engagent à fond pour produire les produits de la meilleure qualité.
 
État d'avancement. Calendrier
Nous avons produit notre modèle 3D dans Rhinoceros. Puis, avec l'aide de la société INPACT (Leiria, Portugal), nous avons imprimé plusieurs versions de notre design. INPACT fonctionne avec la dernière génération d'imprimante SLS 3DSystem. Nous avons sélectionné deux matériaux pour les impressions : le Duraform Flex et le Duraform TPU. Ces matériaux flexibles nous permettent de produire des prototypes qui imitent le produit final avec précision. Nous avons imprimé 3 prototypes avant de passer au premier moule d'injection.Nous avons déjà produit 4 prototypes de moules d'injection et de compression nécessaires pour les deux versions de la Jungle. Un pour la semelle en caoutchouc de la version LUX, un pour la semelle complète LUX, un pour la mousse EVA de la version LIGHT et enfin un pour le corps extérieur qui est le même pour les deux versions de la jungle.Pendant le déroulement de la campagne, nous continuons à travailler et à peaufiner les détails pour offrir à vos pieds le meilleur confort possible.Dès que l'objectif de la campagne sera atteint, nous lancerons la fabrication d'un groupe de moules pour une taille unique. Février 2018.Après les derniers tests et ajustements, nous lancerons la production des moules pour toutes les autres tailles. Mars 2018.Ensuite, nous allons produire toutes les paires de Jungle, les emballer et vous les expédier. Avril/Mai 2018.

Barfuss Komfort überall
Mit dem iGUANEYE Jungle...

können Ihre Füße atmen, befreit von der Enge geschlossener Schuhe.
werden Ihre Füße gehalten, damit sie laufen, springen und sich frei bewegen können.
sind Ihre Füße geschützt, damit sie auch schwieriges Gelände bewältigen können.

Der iGUANYE Jungle bietet mit ultra-minimalem Design, optimalen Schutz des Fußes. Er passt sich wie eine zweite Haut an und folgt all Ihren Bewegungen.
Ein Stück Ultraflex Elastomer hält nur die große Zehe und die Ferse des Fußes. Durch diesen Halt, wird die ergonomische Sohle fixiert und wie durch Magie: ES HÄLT ! Der Jungle ist der komfortabelste Schuh aller Zeiten! Testen Sie das unglaubliche Barfußgefühl.
 
2 austauschbare Varianten : der Jungle LUX und der Jungle LIGHT
Der Jungle LUX bietet das ultimative Komfort Erlebnis. Er wurde designt, um Sie bei all Ihren Aktivitäten zu begleiten. Die Sohlenvariante ist ein Mix aus Kork und Latex. Flexibel und formbar, passt er sich an Ihren Fußabdruck an. Diese natürliche Kombination von Materialien in der Sohle sorgt nicht nur für Halt, sondern bietet mit dem integrierten Kork ein antibakterielles Material, das Schweiß und Gerüche aufsaugt. Die LUX Sohle ist mit weichem Leder überzogen (eine vegane Variante wird auch angeboten werden). Der Kunststoff an der Unterseite der Sohle bietet maximalen Schutz vor Abreibung.
Der Jungle LIGHT hat die gleiche Form wie die LUX Version, wird aber aus EVA Schaum erzeugt. Unglaublich leicht und wasserfest, mit weicher und komfortabler Passform. Die LIGHT Variante bietet den Vorteil auch Wasser oder starkem Regen zu trotzen.
 
2 Teile, die wie ein 3D Puzzle zusammenpassen
Das 3D Puzzle System gibt Ihnen die Möglichkeit die zwei Hauptteile mit unterschiedlichen Sohlen und Farben zu kombinieren und individuell zu gestalten. Die zwei Teile fügen sich leicht ineinander und lassen sich in wenigen Sekunden austauschen.
 
Inspiriert von indigenen Völkern des Amazonas
Wie auch das erste Modell von iGUANEYE – den Freshoes – wurde der Jungle von Überlieferung von indigenen Völkern des Amazonas inspiriert. Diese haben ihre Füße in flüssigen Kautschuk getaucht, um sie zu schützen.
Wir haben versucht diese Erfahrung in Experimenten nachzustellen, und so wurden die iGUANEYE Freshoes geboren.
 
Unser erstes Modell – der Freshoes – ist ein voller Erfolg
Seit unserer ersten Crowdfunding Kampagne, haben wir mehr als 20.000 Paar Freshoes auf der ganzen Welt verkauft.
Ob neugierig, experimentierfreudig oder Hardcore-Fan – wenn sie den Komfort den iGUANEYE bietet, erlebt haben, möchten Sie nicht mehr auf konventionelle Sandalen oder Flip-Flops wechseln.
 
100% made in Porto, Portugal
Wir sind stolz darauf unser Produkt zu 100% in der Nähe von Porto, im wunderschönen Norden von Portugal, zu erzeugen. Unsere Geschäftspartner sehen wir wie Familie, gemeinsam sind wir bestrebt, das beste Produkt zu erzeugen.
 
Wo stehen wir jetzt. Planung
Wir haben bereits unser 3D Modell in Rhinoceros entworfen. Danach wurden mit Hilfe von INPACT (Leiria Portugal) mehrere Versionen unserer komplexen Prototypen produziert. INPACT arbeitet mit der neuesten Generation von 3D System SLS Druckern. Zwei Materialien wurden für die Prototypen gewählt: Duraform Flex und Duraform TPU. Diese flexiblen Materialien ermöglichen es uns mit Prototypen zu arbeiten, die das Endprodukt genau nachstellen. Es wurden drei Prototypen entwickelt, bevor wir die Spritzgussformen fertiggestellt haben.
Vier Spritzgussformen wurden bereits produziert, gemeinsam mit den zwei Formpressen für die unterschiedlichen Varianten des Jungle. Eine für die Kunststoff-Außensohle der LUX Version, eine für die komplette LUX Sohle, eine für die EVA Schaumsohle der LIGHT Version und schließlich eine Form für beide Außensohlen, die sowohl bei der LUX als auch bei der LIGHT Versionen zum Einsatz kommt.
Während die Kampagne läuft, arbeiten wir noch weiter an der Perfektion der Details, um Ihren Füßen die beste Passform zu bieten, die Sie je erlebt haben.
Sobald das Funding Ziel erreicht wird, werden wir an der Fertigstellung der Formen und dazugehörigen Größe für eines der Modelle arbeiten. Februar 2018.Nach Abschlusstests und Anpassungen werden wir die Produktionsformen für alle anderen Größen fertig stellen. März 2018.Danach gehen wir in den Produktionslauf der Jungle Paare, verpacken und versenden diese. April/Mai 2018.
 
Größen, Farben und Versand
Am Ende der Kampagne erhalten Sie Zugang zu einer Online-Umfrage, um Ihre Größe und Ihren Farbwunsch zu eruieren.
Größen:Der iGUANYE Jungle passt sich an Ihre Füße an. Die Wahl der Größe ist vereinfacht, da wir nur mit ganzen Größen arbeiten. Wählen Sie Ihre gewohnte Größe, hier können Sie nicht falsch liegen.
Um sicherzugehen, können Sie auch die Größentabelle und das „iGUANEYE Size Validation Tool“ nutzen.

That was a little bit better but I was still too uncomfortable to sleep.

<h2><strong>Sleep Better. Venture Higher.</strong></h2>
<p>As any experienced adventurer will tell you, sleep is rough at high-altitude. The Altimate™ mask, is a unique drug-free high-altitude sleep solution that can make the difference between a good trek and a great trek. A breakthrough innovation and soon-to-be an essential item in any adventurer’s pack list, the Altimate™ mask provides a natural and effective wearable solution to help alleviate the sleep problems and exhaustion that challenge high-altitude adventurers. In addition, early results of a study suggests that it also helps reduce the severity of headaches that can be experienced at high altitudes.</p>
<p>The Altimate™ mask modulates natural breathing patterns at rest to facilitate breathing. Based on early testing data, the result is a deeper sleep with fewer interruptions and less severe headaches, which may contribute to a stronger performance at altitude.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1520945362/fwvhmyedybncmk8iao6l.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<h3>
<strong>The </strong>Altimate™ Mask Solution</h3>
<p>Designed by the team at Trudell Medical International, the Altimate™ mask was developed specifically to serve the rapidly growing population of high-altitude hikers, trekkers, and adventurers who suffer from poor sleep leading to exhaustion and negatively affected performance. Guides and adventurers shared their experiences on treks around the world, consistently identifying poor sleep as a primary factor determining not only the success but full enjoyment of their experience. Intrigued, and ideally positioned to help, the Trudell team has spent over 12 months developing and testing the Altimate™ mask with the help of adventurers and high-altitude scientists. And now it’s ready.</p>
<p>Ours is a unique device that combines a mask that covers the mouth and nose during sleep, providing airflow resistance only upon exhalation, and a modified neck tube to comfortably secure the mask to the face.  It is designed to help regulate your natural breathing pattern that is often compromised or restricted at high altitudes, where oxygen is thin.</p>
<p>The Altimate™ mask offers an all-natural, portable solution that will alleviate sleep disruption caused by shallow or rapid breathing or troublesome apneas that disrupts sleep, diminishes adventurers’ much-needed rest and recovery and interferes with the full exploration experience.  Further testing suggests that an additional benefit is users may experience less severe headaches that can be experienced at high altitude.</p>

<h3> </h3>
<h3><strong>Comfortable style that delivers.</strong></h3>
<p>Altimate™ is a soft face mask that is held in place by a breathable textile neck tube. It’s designed to form a gentle seal around the mouth and nose, fitted and secured in place with adjustable strings. Unlike current drug alternatives, the Altimate™ mask is a completely natural solution to sleep deprivation at altitude. It is not a pharmaceutical, which typically have unwanted side effects.</p>

<p> </p>
<p><strong>Sleep disruption can and does affect everyone at altitude.</strong></p>
<p>The construction and technology of the Altimate™ mask offer a natural, elegant, and lightweight solution to a common, yet complex sleep problem that diminishes the quality of the journey experience and can force high-altitude adventurers to abandon their expedition.</p>

<strong>How does </strong>Altimate™ mask <strong>work?</strong>
</h3>
<p>Altimate™ mask is designed to cover both the mouth and nose and secured in place within a soft neck tube made of a stylish, breathable, high-performance textile.

</div></div>","Sleep Better. Venture Higher.
As any experienced adventurer will tell you, sleep is rough at high-altitude. The Altimate™ mask, is a unique drug-free high-altitude sleep solution that can make the difference between a good trek and a great trek. A breakthrough innovation and soon-to-be an essential item in any adventurer’s pack list, the Altimate™ mask provides a natural and effective wearable solution to help alleviate the sleep problems and exhaustion that challenge high-altitude adventurers. In addition, early results of a study suggests that it also helps reduce the severity of headaches that can be experienced at high altitudes.
The Altimate™ mask modulates natural breathing patterns at rest to facilitate breathing. Based on early testing data, the result is a deeper sleep with fewer interruptions and less severe headaches, which may contribute to a stronger performance at altitude.

 

The Altimate™ Mask Solution
Designed by the team at Trudell Medical International, the Altimate™ mask was developed specifically to serve the rapidly growing population of high-altitude hikers, trekkers, and adventurers who suffer from poor sleep leading to exhaustion and negatively affected performance. Guides and adventurers shared their experiences on treks around the world, consistently identifying poor sleep as a primary factor determining not only the success but full enjoyment of their experience. Intrigued, and ideally positioned to help, the Trudell team has spent over 12 months developing and testing the Altimate™ mask with the help of adventurers and high-altitude scientists. And now it’s ready.
Ours is a unique device that combines a mask that covers the mouth and nose during sleep, providing airflow resistance only upon exhalation, and a modified neck tube to comfortably secure the mask to the face.  It is designed to help regulate your natural breathing pattern that is often compromised or restricted at high altitudes, where oxygen is thin.
The Altimate™ mask offers an all-natural, portable solution that will alleviate sleep disruption caused by shallow or rapid breathing or troublesome apneas that disrupts sleep, diminishes adventurers’ much-needed rest and recovery and interferes with the full exploration experience.  Further testing suggests that an additional benefit is users may experience less severe headaches that can be experienced at high altitude.

 
Comfortable style that delivers.
Altimate™ is a soft face mask that is held in place by a breathable textile neck tube. It’s designed to form a gentle seal around the mouth and nose, fitted and secured in place with adjustable strings. Unlike current drug alternatives, the Altimate™ mask is a completely natural solution to sleep deprivation at altitude. It is not a pharmaceutical, which typically have unwanted side effects.

 
Sleep disruption can and does affect everyone at altitude.
The construction and technology of the Altimate™ mask offer a natural, elegant, and lightweight solution to a common, yet complex sleep problem that diminishes the quality of the journey experience and can force high-altitude adventurers to abandon their expedition.

How does Altimate™ mask work?

Altimate™ mask is designed to cover both the mouth and nose and secured in place within a soft neck tube made of a stylish, breathable, high-performance textile. An adjustable cord and cord lock system holds the mask in place over the mouth and nose, creating a seal. Our valving system allows for minimal resistance on inhalation, with airflow resistance only upon exhalation. The rebreathing reservoir is another unique feature of the mask, designed to allow for the return of some exhaled CO₂. Worn during sleep, the combination of mild exhalation resistance and CO₂ rebreathing acts to minimize disrupted sleep at altitude by regulating breathing and alleviate headache severity.
During activity, the mask should be removed from the neck tube and stowed. The neck tube may be worn to protect adventurers from outdoor elements.

 TRACPOINT has an integrated presenter so you no longer need to carry and worry about two devices when traveling. Never get caught short with a flat battery. Use your TRACPOINT as a spotlight, move between slides and as a functional tool to swap between applications or windows. Use the Swiftpoint Control Panel to configure and optimize all presenter functions, colors, SpotPoint size, button functions and speed.

Precisely navigate and identify key areas of your slides and desktop. Configure size and style of your SpotPoint. ACTIVATE LINKSNavigate the on-screen cursor to play or pause videos, open links and activate slides within your presentation to keep your audience on the edge of their seats.  APPLICATION CHANGEUse the unique TRACPOINT application changing feature to seamlessly swap between your presentation and associated materials. Build confidence with your materials and present any way you want.  
 We’ve spent hours researching the perfect shape, watching users struggle with a mouse, lifting and moving heavy and cumbersome devices. Even those beautiful white mice from the fruit company have many issues. Form and function must work together. We have the answer and the science to prove it. TRACPOINT is portable, connecting via Bluetooth and the highly accurate optical sensor is great on almost any surface. It's small enough to use on your laptop palm rest or flight tray table. Wherever you are and whenever you go the TRACPOINT is your productivity partner.The pen-grip, small size, light weight and Rapid Charge battery combine to make the TRACPOINT the perfect travel mouse for work anywhere and anytime. 
 A 60 second charge gives up to 1 hour of use, while a full 1 hour charge gives up to 2 weeks of use. TRACPOINT has a great battery and charging system. The USB charging dongle simply plugs into any USB port your laptop or tablet. The self-locating magnet connector aligns the charge pins and safely holds the mouse in place when charging. Never get caught out with a flat battery again, work anywhere with confidence.

<p>The GOB∆G is a carry-on sized duffel bag designed so you can travel compact with all the gear you need. Its killer feature is the Max Pack Bag, which allows you to vacuum compress your soft items. This enables you to carry enough for a long trip in a 35 litre bag.</p>

<p>GOB∆G’s simple and robust design is engineered to last a lifetime. The outer bag is constructed from only two pieces of TPU coated ballistic nylon, a material commonly used to make inflatable boats. This ‘less is more’ design approach is continued throughout the product.</p>

<p>The Full Edge Zip is a 2 meter long, durable YKK zip that runs along the outer edge of the front and side panels. This means more of your gear is next to the zip; you'll never have to dig around at the bottom of your bag again.</p>
<p>More zip. Less hassle.</p>

<p>James came up with the idea for the GOBAG two years ago. He was traveling a lot between London and Scotland for weekend trips on Easyjet flights and was frustrated that he couldn't take everything he needed as hand luggage. His cheap but functional solution was to pack all his clothes in a bin bag, vacuum the air out and zip tie the end. He thought ""There's got to be an easier way to do this...""</p>
<p>The GOBAG was born.</p>

</div>","The GOB∆G is a carry-on sized duffel bag designed so you can travel compact with all the gear you need. Its killer feature is the Max Pack Bag, which allows you to vacuum compress your soft items. This enables you to carry enough for a long trip in a 35 litre bag.




GOB∆G’s simple and robust design is engineered to last a lifetime. The outer bag is constructed from only two pieces of TPU coated ballistic nylon, a material commonly used to make inflatable boats. This ‘less is more’ design approach is continued throughout the product.


The Full Edge Zip is a 2 meter long, durable YKK zip that runs along the outer edge of the front and side panels. This means more of your gear is next to the zip; you'll never have to dig around at the bottom of your bag again.
More zip. Less hassle.



This feature doesn't need much explanation. It's the perfect size for 95% of the major airlines' carry-on, even Ryanair!


The Max Pack Bag is the GOB∆G's killer feature. It's a welded bag made from TPU coated nylon with an integrated vacuum check valve to compress all your soft goods. Just throw your gear into the bag, seal it and compress it. You can compress the bag by either using a vacuum cleaner or compressing it by hand.
Pack. Vac. Go.
The Max Pack Bag is fully removable. Just unscrew the check valve, release the attachments inside the GOB∆G, and pop the cap on, then you're ready to go.

We've had enough of those disposable plastic bags you get at the airport. Our integrated wash bag means an end to wasting time at airport security – your liquids and pastes are ready to go from the off. Just rip off the wash bag from its velcro attachment and you're good to go.

We've also designed an adaptable laptop harness that holds your notebook securely away from the edges of the bag. It can take care of everything between 11-15 inches. One less thing to worry about.
Shhhh... we've added a hidden pocket to the bag. Who doesn't love a secret pocket? It's also quite useful for your money, passport and other secret stuff. 
Here's what some of our early testers have been saying about the GOB∆G.







Hypalon is the ultimate in abrasion protection. We have placed it over the maximum wear areas like the base.

TPU Coated Ballistic Nylon the ultimate waterproof material. This is the stuff that inflatable power boats are made out of.

Metal G Hooks Forget those flimsy plastic buckles that you get on some bags. Ours are made out of metal. 

Monkey Fist Zip Pulls Made from high tensile strength para cord. A knot that a salty sea dog would be proud of.

YKK Zippers Everyone knows that all the best gear uses YKK zips not some rubbish imitation. Zips matter!

<p><strong>Storyteller</strong><strong> was started with three main objectives:</strong> To build the best travel accessories; inspire more people to travel and help fund educational projects for individuals who are less privileged.  </p>
<p>Although travelling shows us so many positives, it also shows us the world’s biggest problems. Recent UNESCO figures show that there are 750 million youth and adults who are unable to read and write a simple sentence. </p>
<p>This not only has long-term consequences for those individuals affected, but also for the next generation, who become part of a repeat cycle of inequality and poverty.</p>
<p>At Storyteller, we are passionate about wanting to make a real change to this problem and to do this, we work with with like-minded global charities to help fund their educational projects for both children and adults in less privileged areas of the world. </p>

<p>The founder of Storyteller is Bhav Patel. Having practiced as a Lawyer for many years, he has led many Corporate Social Responsibility programmes, which has allowed him to work closely with large charities and understand the technical details of how the sector operates. He has since put this knowledge into practice by becoming an integral member of the UNICEF, NextGen, London team.</p>
<p>When Bhav first had the idea about creating FlagMate, he wanted to ensure that the company stood for two values that he was most passionate about, his love for travel and giving back to those less fortunate. He wanted to showcase the positives of travel, but also use this platform to show the educational problems around the world and create a community of like-minded people to come together and help resolve these problems.</p>
<p>The Storyteller team has since grown with like-minded individuals from backgrounds in law, branding, marketing, fashion and product design and the charity sector. </p>
<p>Although we all have our own expertise, we all have two things in common, the love of travel and the passion to do good.</p>

</div></div>","The travel keyring made from eco-friendly faux leather, which helps travellers to capture their travel memories by attaching hand-painted flags of each country you have visited or will be visiting, with the added option to engrave a special memory or date to the back of each flag. 

Each FlagMate holds up to 30 Flags, BUT for you ULTIMATE TRAVELLERS,  we have a custom FlagMate which can hold up to 100 flags! (see below). 

FlagMate is available with a clip to attach anywhere you like... 


Also available without a clip to use as an elegant stylish keyring 

Each Storyteller Flag is custom made and individually hand-painted, with a protected finish to avoid any scratching.


With the added option to PERSONALISE the back of each flag using up to 30 characters.

If you prefer not to personalise your Flag, we will simply add the name of the country on the back!
Use FlagMate to share your travel stories with other travellers from around the world. 



Simply send us a message on social media @storytellerteam or email us at hello@storytellertravel.co.uk adding how many flags you require. 

Simply send us a message on social media @storytellerteam or email us at hello@storytellertravel.co.uk letting us know how many flags you require and we will create an awesome bundle and CUSTOM FlagMate just for you!

We wanted to design a solution to address a major pain point for travellers around the world of how to best preserve their travel memories.
We combined the longevity of a journal with the simplicity of a souvenir to create FlagMate. 


Our friends who are already rocking their own FlagMates!


Storyteller was started with three main objectives: To build the best travel accessories; inspire more people to travel and help fund educational projects for individuals who are less privileged.  
Although travelling shows us so many positives, it also shows us the world’s biggest problems. Recent UNESCO figures show that there are 750 million youth and adults who are unable to read and write a simple sentence. 
This not only has long-term consequences for those individuals affected, but also for the next generation, who become part of a repeat cycle of inequality and poverty.
At Storyteller, we are passionate about wanting to make a real change to this problem and to do this, we work with with like-minded global charities to help fund their educational projects for both children and adults in less privileged areas of the world. 

Our Founder, Bhav in India running classes at The Barefoot College in India (April 2018). 
 
We also work with our friends in sport to help us share the importance of education. 

Shane Warne (Australian Cricketer) with our Founder and the Children from The Barefoot College. 
 

Ajinkya Rahane (Vice-Captain Indian Cricket Team) with our founder and speaking with the children from The Barefoot College. 
It is our vision to bring together passionate travellers from around the world in unity with a mission to do good. 
We hope you will support and join us on this journey of empowerment as together, we can make a difference.

The founder of Storyteller is Bhav Patel. Having practiced as a Lawyer for many years, he has led many Corporate Social Responsibility programmes, which has allowed him to work closely with large charities and understand the technical details of how the sector operates. He has since put this knowledge into practice by becoming an integral member of the UNICEF, NextGen, London team.
When Bhav first had the idea about creating FlagMate, he wanted to ensure that the company stood for two values that he was most passionate about, his love for travel and giving back to those less fortunate. He wanted to showcase the positives of travel, but also use this platform to show the educational problems around the world and create a community of like-minded people to come together and help resolve these problems.
The Storyteller team has since grown with like-minded individuals from backgrounds in law, branding, marketing, fashion and product design and the charity sector. 
Although we all have our own expertise, we all have two things in common, the love of travel and the passion to do good.


At Storyteller, we are passionate about using environmentally friendly and sustainable materials for our products. From the printing of our clothing to the materials used in our products and packaging, we use the best progressive and sustainable materials. Some of the materials we use include recycled card, plant-based materials, and non-PVC polyurethane microfibre.


Each FlagMate has cross coloured stitching and our favourite passport style stamped logo embossed into the high-quality faux leather
.


The flag designs are drawn into a piece of metal after which they are each hand-painted one by one. 

With the added option to laser engrave a special message to the back of each Storyteller Flag. The perfect way to capture your special memories.
Here are some of the countries already made and ready to go!

 

Each t-shirt is made from a mix of organic cotton and bamboo which is quick dry, wind resistant, comfortable and long-lasting in both material and style.

The bamboo is ethically sourced from China where it is pressed and crushed mechanically before being sent to India where it is produced sustainably creating the perfect tee for every traveller!

forest in which to enjoy the Amazon River, the Rain Forest, its flora, fauna and
its people.  We have to maintain minimum staff in the lodge at all times

using my retirement to purchase the lodge.  It is difficult for family and

love of Peru and the Amazon Rain Forest.  It gives me a unique purpose
that I have never before had.   When I purchased this lodge, I had a
dream, and with the help of Walter Peña, now the manager of the lodge, a plan
was developed, much of the old poorly constructed lodge was torn down and the
new lodge was built from the ground up.  It was an ominous task that ended
up more costly than anticipated and taking longer to finish than planned as so
much is centered around the rise and fall of the Amazon River.  But it was
worth it and early in 2010 we were ready to present our beautiful new lodge to
guests.  The dream was realized!</span><br/></p>

CHULLACHAQUI LODGE
The
mighty Amazon River flows past mythical forests and the
reflection of the deep greens of the jungle and wide blue skies on the river’s dark
water create a special magic. Here, biological diversity is at its riches, Pink
Dolphins rule the river and lily pads grow as big as small pools. Sloth
and Iguana are common jungle creatures, and the jewel-like colors of the bird
life are stunning.
Our lodge
is constructed primarily with local eco friendly materials, built in the
traditional way, and we choose to use local labor from our surrounding
communities. Our guests find the best of both
worlds: comfort and great service and an opportunity to
experience all that the Amazon has to offer!
 Eco-cultural
activities are organized to promote sustainable tourism. Our local
bilingual naturalist guides host excursions including: daily hikes in the
jungle, birding, nocturnal activities, paddling dugout canoes, piranha fishing,
tours to spot exotic animals including: sloths, caiman, pink and gray river
dolphins, reptiles, amphibians, insects, all sorts of monkeys, birds and, of
course, the flora including gorgeous flowers, impressive giant trees and the
important medicinal plants of the rain forest.  We also visit nearby
jungle communities, where we do many cooperative activities, this gives
our guests an opportunity to personally met the native people and learn about
their culture.

OUR CHALLENGES
Because of the economy, tourism in Iquitos is way down.  Gasoline prices are up, as are the costs of
food, and upkeep of the lodge.  The lodge must be maintained at all times,
as the jungle takes it back very quickly.  Our lodge is located 97 kilometers (60 miles) up the Amazon River from
Iquitos, Peru.  This presents a challenge as the only way to reach the
lodge is by our speed boat and it is very costly to operate our boat when we
only have a few guests.  Our location is an ideal spot in primary rain
forest in which to enjoy the Amazon River, the Rain Forest, its flora, fauna and
its people.  We have to maintain minimum staff in the lodge at all times
and we have to maintain a small office in Iquitos from which we operate.  We
are in our second year of operation under the new ownership and we want
to survive.  But it is becoming more difficult to keep the lodge open.  Most of our guests are referrals from former guests, or they find us when they arrive in Iquitos looking for the perfect lodge with the programs they want.

WHY THIS
FUNDRAISER IS IMPORTANT TO ME! 
I turned my world upside down by
using my retirement to purchase the lodge.  It is difficult for family and
friends to understand why it is so important to me, but it is the epitome of my
love of Peru and the Amazon Rain Forest.  It gives me a unique purpose
that I have never before had.   When I purchased this lodge, I had a
dream, and with the help of Walter Peña, now the manager of the lodge, a plan
was developed, much of the old poorly constructed lodge was torn down and the
new lodge was built from the ground up.  It was an ominous task that ended
up more costly than anticipated and taking longer to finish than planned as so
much is centered around the rise and fall of the Amazon River.  But it was
worth it and early in 2010 we were ready to present our beautiful new lodge to
guests.  The dream was realized!

It is also my dream to do something more, to give back, especially to the local jungle communities, to get involved in a more profound way than just as a tourist lodge. I want to create a place for learning and giving.  We also want to provide our guests an opportunity to visit a magical place, to learn about the Amazon and all that it has to offer; to understand why it is so ecologically important to our world.
 
Our staff have been loyal to us, sticking with us through these lean times.  We want to try to continue to provide a place of employment for them as jobs are difficult to find.

WHAT WE HAVE DONE

We have tried many things to draw
attention to our lodge, created a new website:  www.chullachaquiecolodge.com,
contacted travel agencies in Peru and in the United States, we have reached out
to our friends and family to pass along the word about our lodge and also contacted
former guests and asked them to get the word out.  We've  created
a facebook page dedicated to the lodge.  We practice sustainable tourism
by employing people from the local jungle communities to work in the lodge, we
purchase fish and other products from the local communities and hire locals
to provide services such as construction, security and more.
We have
cut our costs in every way possible, but we cannot survive without
bringing in guests.  And we want to survive.

WHAT WE NEED
We realized
that you work very hard for your money and you have a choice on where you invest. We
hope you will feel the survival of Chullachaqui Lodge is a worthwhile cause and that you will consider participating in our fundraiser.  We
are extremely grateful for all contributions, no matter how small or large.  We also
understand that not everyone can contribute, but you can still help us by
getting the word out about our fundraiser.  All will
assist us in our survival.
Our goals are listed in order of importance and how
we plan to use any funds that are raised through IndieGoGo.  Funds raised
will be used for solely for the goals outlined below.  If we do not
reach our financial goal, any funds raised will still be used toward reaching
our goals.
·         It is critical to develop a marketing budget in order to develop brochures and other maketing materials, to market our
website so it will rise to a more prominent position, to allow us the opportunity to join
essential partners like Prom Peru and the local Chamber of Commerce and others
that will help us reach out to promote the Lodge.   It is essential
for us to market the Lodge in the United States and European market.
·        
Our small boat needs a motor.  This
boat was stolen and recovered minus the motor and the interior fittings.
 To upgrade this little boat and add a motor would help us tremendously to
cut down our gasoline costs when there are only a few guests going to the
lodge.  We need to purchase a minimum 50 HP motor for this boat.
·        
It is important for us to construct new
staff quarters.  Our present building was one of the original poorly

with a foot or so of water inside and we are unable to use it during
this time.  Afterward, it requires extensive cleanup and repair.
·        
It is extremely important to us to
become more involved with the local communities in the education of the
children in our local villages and providing assistance in the form of school
supplies and transport to Iquitos.  We also want to teach our communities more about ecology and
how they can participate in saving the Rain Forest.  We can do this by

We also want to become more involved in
the ecology of the Rain Forest, partner with non-profit organizations that are
established to protect and save the Rain Forest so that we can find
ways to do our part to protect Rain Forest.  We would also hope to partner
with a University and utilize our lodge as a research center for students and
professors and we would eventually like to build a research lab for this
purpose.
·         Our water system needs to be redone, with new water tanks and a good filtration system.  We utilize a well and because it was not originally installed deep enough, and filtration is not good enough we have a lot of minerals in the water that clog the shower heads and discolor our sinks, toilets and showers.
·         We want to make many improvements to the lodge, such as bring in solar power to provide electricity in our kitchen and provide hot water,  We want to remain rustic and do not plan to have electric lights, but we would like to be able to provide electric to charge batteries, phones, laptops, etc, for our guests.   We would also like to have a satellite phone in the lodge to give us better access to the outside world in case of any type of an emergency.  Other amenities that we would like to add at some point for the comfort of our guests, are ceiling fans in our sleeping rooms and WiFi.

As you can
see we have dreams and lots of things to accomplish!  We
may not be able to do all of these things immediately, but we want to do as
much as we can.  We are asking you to help
us realize our dreams and we will be forever grateful for your help.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>I'm a passionate visual artist, photographer, filmmaker, painter, all-style &amp; roller-skate dancer &amp; automobile aficionado. Life goal is to finish my documentary film, ""The Bboy Connection,"" I enjoy experiencing new adventures. </p>
<p>This project is very important to me because this is a chance and a life time opportunity to have a unlimited gas card to go where ever I want to go and do what I enjoy by taking photos of great landscapes and exploring our nation.  </p>
<p>I would appreciate this opportunity very much so I can also drive to New York and other east coast locations to finishing important interviews of the characters in my bboy documentary that are a part of American history. The world needs to learn and understand their story and how this dance the bboy ""Breakdance"" came from. It is a timeline history and this trip will be a small step closer to reaching my goal. </p>
<p>Remember, keep it concise, yet personal. Ask yourself: if someone stopped reading here would they be ready to make a contribution?</p>
<p></p>
<p>
</p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Between $1500 to $2000 will help me stay on the road and capture the photos that I enjoy to photograph and film on video. That way I wont have to rush home to take care of business and focus more on what I enjoy the most, photography/filmmaking and travel. If I make more than this then the longer I can stay in each city and especially in New York where I need to spend the most time for my documentary film. Money also for survival, blessing the people I know that will let me stay with in New York. It is not easy getting some of the dancers to do interviews with me. When I offer them some money to help them out and take them out to eat during the interviews really helps. Hotels on other routes along the way and also to visit my family on the east cost. All my family from my mothers side is on the east coast. Their in North Carolina, Kentucky, DC and Brooklyn New York. To catch up with my family and take portraits of many cousins, aunts and uncles who I haven't seen since I was a kid living in the east coast and the cousins I haven't met who are only friends on my facebook. To finally get many of my photos printed on large prints and canvas to give to the people who donate to the perk they choose and o prepare for future galleries of my art to then try it again for the final fundraiser for my bboy connection documentary film ""The Bboy Connection."" </p>
<p>By choosing the perks below will give you exclusive insights to my work. Prints that only you will have from limited editions that you choose from. by choosing the screenings you will see never before footage of bboy dance history that has never been posted online. Interviews and stories you will see that will have you educating your mind with a whole new look and understanding of the history of the ""bboy"" dance culture and hip-hop's timeline from the last 40 years of it's existence. </p>
<p>Describe where the funds go if you don’t reach your entire goal.</p>
<p>If I don't reach my entire goal then I will have a shorter drive and only drive to places that were already planned for Space camp. Remember my trip to Space Camp is already paid for by Ford Motors including my gas. My hotel is already paid for once I get to Space camp. I will just be driving straight back home if if I don't reach my goal or even with half or 30% of my goal I will drive a little extra to new cities based on the support and budget from this campaign. </p>

</h3><p>My journey began on December 17th, 2008, when I survived a fire that consumed my house and the majority of my worldly possessions. After spending Christmas with friends and family, the insurance claim was settled and I was presented with an incredible opportunity and a very difficult choice. Life had given me a “do-over” and this time I was going to invest in things that couldn’t go up in smoke. I chose to seek out experience and adventure; I chose to travel. <br/></p><p>After collecting my insurance claim, I embarked on a multi-month road trip adventure around the US that forever changed who I am. Living day-to-day, focusing on my most basic needs, I quickly realized that traveling can be so much more than seeing the sights. Once given the ability to choose my own path, I felt the freedom and security of being a completely self-contained unit. Though traveling has given me some of the most valuable lessons of my life, it all comes at a price. <br/></p><p>Once my insurance settlement ran out and I returned to Virginia, I felt restless and couldn’t wait to get back some of that freedom I had become so fond of while traveling. Empowered with a new sense of self-reliance, I moved to Portland, OR in the summer of 2011. My new home would introduce me to more freedom and security than I had ever thought possible. </p>
<p>Portland introduced me to a vibrant and supportive bike culture where I found lots of that freedom I had been craving since my first road-trip adventure. My passion for cycling grew until my next obvious step was a long distance tour.</p><p>In the summer of 2013 I was finally able to combine my love for travel and my love for cycling in a 1,111 mile ride along the California coast. Cycling gave me the opportunity to travel on a limited budget and to learn how much more rewarding traveling can be by bike rather than by car. In the coming months, I will embark on another grand cycling adventure and with your help, I’d like to share that experience with the world. <br/></p><h3>The Tour and Blog<br/>
</h3><p>This July, my mom's side of the family will be gathering in her hometown of Battle Creek, Michigan. Starting from my driveway in Portland, I'll ride the 3,000+ miles to meet them! I want to share this mission of freedom, adventure, and advocacy. To do this I'm creating a content rich, professional website and blog. I’ll share my experience in real time with regular blog posts, maps, video journals and travel tips. I want to bring you along for the ride. Although travel can often seem out of reach for those on a tight budget, I’ll show you how cycling can make it accessible to almost anyone. I’ll be using lots of money saving techniques along the entire route. I’ll share my secrets for finding the best free camp sites, show you how to build some of your own gear and even share some of my recipes for high calorie meals you can make on the road.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>What I Need<br/>
</h3><p>My base goal of $2000 will enable me to create engaging content while on the road and share it with you via my blog. This amount includes a $700 budget for web design, hosting and maintenance. The largest cost associated with this will be for daily website maintenance while I'm on the road. Because of my limited internet access, I'll need someone to edit videos and blog posts as well as manage the website while I'm traveling. I've estimated an $800 budget for recording and other electronic equipment and a $500 budget for supplies for DIY projects. I've designed this project to scale with available funds, so as funds vary, the scope of these projects can expand or shrink to match. <br/></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p></div>","Who I Am

<p>Here's my standard artist bio that I use to introduce myself:</p>
<p><em>Patrice Helmar is an Alaskan artist, photographer, and educator. Helmar's photography is inspired, in part, by her desire to honor and continue the craft of her father. Helmar's work is influenced by documentary and street photography, as well as by modern painting and literature. Patrice most recently had a solo exhibition the summer of 2011, at the Juneau Douglas City Museum. Her work has appeared in solo, and group shows in Alaska.</em></p>
<p><em>Patrice was the 2012 featured artist in the <a href=""http://www.uas.alaska.edu/arts_sciences/humanities/tidalechoes/docs/tidalechoes2012.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow""> University of Alaska literary magazine</a>, ""Tidal Echoes"". In addition to her artwork being featured in the publication, she juried the fall student artwork show at UAS. </em></p>
<p><em><br/></em><strong>You probably already know me, and if we've hung out in the past few months -</strong> you've heard about how excited I am to be going to a <a href=""%22http:/www.photoxpeditions.com/xpeditions/photo-workshop-iceland"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">photography workshop</a> with <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGB7TTUm0Wg"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Mary Ellen Mark</a> in Reykjavik, Iceland. </p>
<p>This two week workshop with Mary Ellen Mark and her husband, Martin Bell is an incredible oppotunity for me to create a body of photographic work with the guidance of one of the world's great documentary photographers. </p>
<p>Please follow my journey on my blog, <a href=""http://alaskatoiceland.wordpress.com/2012/07/25/day-six-in-the-field-in-island/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">An Alaskan in Iceland</a>. </p>
<p><strong>Here's the deal . . .</strong></p>
<p>The workshop will take place this summer, from June 22-August 9, and I'm asking for your help to get me there &amp; back again! I know it's coming up this weekend, but I get nervous about these fundraiser deals. </p>
<p>The workshop is expensive. It costs around $3,800, and travel to and from Alaska is never cheap. I'm not asking for my entire trip to be funded, but I'm setting a goal of <strong>$5,000 </strong>and any little bit you might be able to give can help.</p>
<p>This money will help me off set the cost of the workshop, publish a small book of a body of my work, and allow me to create/print some thank you gifts for contributors. </p>
<p><em>Here's a taste of what I'll be doing in Iceland . . .</em></p>
<p><strong>1. Create a body of photographic work</strong> in a vibrant city alive with music festivals, a gay pride parade, fisherman, people on the street, musicians, people like me and you, anything that captures my eye. </p>
<p><strong>2. Meet with Mary Ellen Mark </strong>each morning for an individual critique and session covering the photographic work from my previous day. </p>
<p><strong>3. Attend lectures, discussions, and exhibitions </strong>as a part of the workshop group. Additionally, I will be staying in an apartment with three other workshop attendees dedicated to photography and filmmaking, who will support a positive peer learning community. </p>
<p><strong>4. Create a body of work for submission to </strong>print publications, for an Alaska State Museum exhibition, gallery exhibition, or even possibly for admission into a graduate program in photography.</p>
<p><strong>5. Create my own book </strong>with my images from Iceland, and a body of my work from the past ten years. </p>
<p>You can help! </p>
<p><strong>The Impact: </strong></p>
<p>As an artist who is also an educator, I'll be coming back to Juneau and bringing my knowledge into the classroom and my community. I believe in experiential learning. By learning from and photographing other cultures, I can enrich the culture I am a part of. </p>
<p>Are you a public school teacher in Juneau, Alaska getting ready for the 2012 - 2013 school year? If I'm not hired by the Juneau school district as a full time teacher, I'd be happy to give a lesson on writing about photography, or art as it fits into your curriculum. </p>
<p>If I am hired on as a teacher in the Juneau School District, yay!  I'll have my own classroom where I'll integrate my experience and work in Iceland into my own lessons, and will be happy to talk to other educators about art education in language arts or social studies classrooms. </p>
<p><strong>I'll have a new body of work</strong> - and this is huge for me. I'll be able to apply for shows around the state, and if I feel confident enough at the Alaska State Museum during the next call for submissions. </p>
<p>If you're having a rough time financially, (most of us are) but you believe this project is worthy of having other folks take a look - pass it on. </p>
<p><strong>Link my site to your facebook account, post it to your Tumblr, tweet it up, or email it to friends you think may be able to support my project in Iceland. </strong></p>
<p>I appreciate your time and consideration. </p>

<h3>==================</h3>
<p>UPDATE!  We completed our test flights in Leon, Mexico!  Success!</p>
<p>We test-flew the little yellow boat, under helium balloons, to over 20,000 feet-- in manned flight! We even tested landing on a lake, to test the viability of landing on water-- if we need to ditch at sea. <a href=""http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2234126/Fearless-adventurer-takes-air-boat-carried-hundreds-BALLOONS-prepares-cross-Atlantic.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Check out our flying boat!  This is the trans-Atlantic shakeout flight!</a></p>
<p>For the next test, I built and flew a massive cluster of balloons-- like we will need for the Atlantic Ocean;  I used that cluster to fly a house!  We had partnership to pay for the helium, and this allowed us to test building a massive cluster-- which serves as a proof-of-concept that we can actually build a cluster of balloons large enough for our trans-Atlantic dreams!</p>

<h3>==================</h3>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>I want to take a huge cluster of toy helium balloons, tie them to my tiny yellow boat, and fly across the Atlantic Ocean.</h3>
<p>This childhood dream is an achievable reality. I can totally do this.</p>
<p>Didn’t you have a dream like this?  As a child, didn’t you wonder if it could be done?</p>
<p>Years have been spent to get to this point, and we are an the brink of making history.  I am an experienced pilot and I've flown cluster balloons many times.</p>
<p>I've conquered the <a href=""http://youtu.be/3MIxVEAZ8-Y"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">English Channel</a>, departing England, floating out over the iconic White Cliffs of Dover, and landing in the welcoming fields of France. </p>
<p>On a bitter cold night, many months later, I launched in France, crossed the <a href=""http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/howaboutthat/8764996/Helium-balloonist-becomes-first-to-cross-the-Alps.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Alps</a>, and landed in the deep green fields of Italy the next morning.</p>
<p>If you open the 2012 Guinness Book of World Records, you will see me on the first full page, flying away in manned flight under the largest cluster of balloons ever built.  Well, the largest built so far…</p>
<p>Because there she is, looming in front of us: The Atlantic Ocean.  Nobody has made an attempt like this, and together, you and I might just ride the winds across the skies, and across the seas, to wonderful success.</p>
<h3>What We Need </h3>
</div>
<div>
<p>Can you imagine the number of balloons it takes? Even to get off the ground I need a massive cluster. But to be successful in this journey together we will need to build the largest cluster of balloons ever flown — eclipsing the current world record we set previously. We will need to fly longer than anyone has ever flown like this. </p>
<p>I will need wind. I will need helium. I will need hope. </p>
<p>To succeed, I need that precious, invisible gas: helium. I need 106,215 cubic feet of helium. That is the exact amount needed for this Indiegogo project.  It is sold by Praxair, an industrial gas provider. It is invisible, yet vital.</p>
<p>There will be a television documentary made. If you cause this flight to happen, you will see what you have created. In news reports during the crossing, in the documentary that is to follow, you will know what you helped to make happen: dreams, inspiration, and genuine adventure for millions of people, even in our modern times.</p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
</div>
<div>
<p>The stunning imagery produced during our expeditions takes people back to their childhood dreams. It is inspoirational.  It is beuatiful. And it is unique.</p>
<p>The seemingly impossible is up for grabs. If we can throw ourselves into this great challenge and succeed, it reminds all of us what we can achieve as individuals, and as a team.</p>
<p>The project is real, and well documented.  Our previous adventures were news sensations; covered live on TV, online and in newspapers around the world.  </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>I'm here, on the coast of Maine, in the USA-- staring at the sea, staring at the sand, and dreaming of what we can do, while working towards the goal.  In addition to the helium, I need a launch site in Presque Isle or Caribou, Maine:  A grassy field where I can stage the helium.  Reach out if you might like to host the launch.</p>
<p>I need helium.  And I need you.  This is not a solitary event.  I need so many people to come out in the dead of night and inflate balloons, when the moment comes.  I need you to follow the flight as it unfolds—I will have a tracker that will show my progress on the website, as I fly.  I need you to root for me, as you see the progress in the press.  I need you to catch me from the sky when I make it across the ocean to any dry land on the far side of the sea.</p>
<p>If we can just get enough balloons, helium and hope, we can do something truly incredible.</p>

<p>Hello! We are a start-up from Finland and we have designed a simple travel product that really works. The Relax ALLY Travel Restband allows you to finally get cozy while traveling in a seated position!!</p>
<p>Our dream is to share the Relax ALLY story with travellers all over the world. Please support us to take our Indiegogo mission to the final destination and do some environmental good while doing so.</p>
<p>And remember, sharing is caring so please let the fellow travellers know:<em><span style=""color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;""><br/></span></em><em><span style=""color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;""><a href=""http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http://bit.ly/relaxally&amp;t=Relax%20ALLY%20Travel%20Restband%20saves%20your%20trip%21"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>Share on Facebook</span></a><br/><a href=""http://twitter.com/share?text=Relax%20ALLY%20Travel%20Restband%20saves%20your%20trip%21&amp;url=http://bit.ly/relaxally"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Share on Twitter</a></span></em></p>
<h2><strong><br/>The Problem</strong></h2>
<p>Trying to sleep while traveling in a seated position can cause the head to nod off or ""surf"".  This leads to waking up abruptly, poor sleep, awkward situations and potential micro-trauma to the neck and shoulder muscles. </p>

<p> <em>Muscular stress</em></p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>Relax ALLY  ...saves your trip!</strong></h2>
<p>Relax ALLY ® Restband™ fastens the head firmly to the seat and by doing so prevents the head from nodding off and thus sleep from being interrupted.

<p><strong>Short Summary</strong></p>
<p>A simple prayer during a 21-Day fast ignited this couple to face the challenges that were NEEDED to be overcome in order to gain the wisdom NEEDED before saying ""I Do"". Having the same desires and wanting the best for each other made this an emotional process but a very enlightening and fulfilling one.</p>
<p>~ ""We were told with such a tight budget, that we would not be able to have our dream wedding and needed to loosen the purse strings. With a positive, creative mindset, the use of our own funds, donated time and a few coupons we accomplished what we were told could not happen.""</p>
<p>~ ""Since family is very important to us both, we were not certain that Kelly's mom and some of Juanita's family would be able to make it. Kelly's mom has been very sick, but with a lot of prayer and positive works, things were put into motion that allowed her and other family to witness our union with great joy!""</p>
<p>""After seeing the unbelievable appear before our eyes on March 23rd, we were excited and looking forward to a peaceful and much needed honeymoon the next day. Working hard and serving others is our life, so when we arrived early to the airport with our boarding passes in hand, we just knew Day 1 of our lives would be another happy occasion, but instead it was Day 1 of facing our first challenge together as a married couple.</p>
<p>While dropping our car rental off early Sunday morning at the Budget location, we were faced by a disgruntle employee who slowly changed our glowing faces to that of confusion. He spoke to us with anger and disrespect. As time went by, it seemed that we would never leave with a solution to his argument concerning the already full gas tank. Juanita mentioned that we had to catch a flight and instantly the employee flipped and became quite belligerent. She apologized but we were cut off and sent to his supervisor. After more time was wasted, the employees still talked to us in circles and did not come up with an answer. They were then reminded again that we had to leave to go on our honeymoon.</p>
<p>Arriving to the gate with everyone gone and every seat deserted was one of the most emptying feelings. We stayed for 3 hours to get help from American Airlines, Carnival Cruises and our travel agent so we could know all of our options, but were told at that time that we had none. We even were on stand-by for the next flight, but only one seat was available. We decided not to separate.</p>
<p>The days that followed were spent talking to all of these variables to understand what we could do and if we could be reimbursed, finally the answers respectfully were NOTHING and NO.""</p>
<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<p>""This circumstance opened our eyes again to the fact that not everyone is on our side, BUT we still believe that there are people out there that ARE on our side and willing to help us celebrate our happiness since we missed this opportunity.</p>
<p>If you can find it in your hearts to give please do.</p>

<li>

<b>Backup #2:</b> Use 100% redundant egressor/ pony bottle - size of your choice (purchased separately).</li>

And it fits in your bag, making it a perfect companion for your travels.Get closer to underwater life than when snorkeling and experience the weightless feeling without carrying heavy air-filled tanks on your back.Diving & being spontaneous? Definitely YES! Pack your AirBuddy for a family day on a beach, go yachting or drive up the coast in your campervan. Or just use if for any other diving activities in shallow water such as underwater photography, lobstering, coral gardening, hull cleaning, pool maintenance, etc. We have been featured in the following media outlets and events. If you are interested in writing about AirBuddy, please feel free to check out our press kit and get in touch with us at media@airbuddy.net.AirBuddy brings a new alternative, bridging the gap between snorkeling and SCUBA. The rechargeable battery-powered air compressor provides you with fresh air from the surface. Just grab it and go swimming between corals and fish - for up to 45 minutes and max 12 metres (40ft) deep. Easy as that!Experience a less inhibited diving experience with increased safety. Don’t carry unnecessarily heavy equipment on yourself - feel like a fish in the water.
No heavy gear on your back
No need to adjust your buoyancy throughout the dive
With no BCD (containing residual air), wear less weights (less gear to carry)
With lower drag, wear smaller fins to propel yourself (less gear to carry)
Use a more natural frog kick (as opposed to flutter kick)
Simply walk to dive sites with difficult road access
Set-up and pack-up in less than 2 minutes
We created AirBuddy as a way to give you the freedom to dive whenever you like without the hassle or the restrictive bulk of SCUBA gear. Take AirBuddy with you when the weather is nice (and ocean calm) and you feel like having an amazing day full of new adventures underwater. It's simple. The rechargeable 12V battery powers the air compressor that pressurises the surface air. The air is then delivered to the diver through a receiver and a supply hose with a regulator (mouthpiece). This means you don’t have to store and take all the compressed air with you under water. You breathe fresh air from the surface.AirBuddy is the ultimate ""grab-and-go"" solution for recreational diving. It's compact and the entire system weighs only 9.5kg (21 lbs), which is about 60-70% less than other dive gear on the market. You can take it with you literally anywhere - it’s plane-friendly and fits your travel bag. No need to worry about operating it - you can set it up/pack it up in just about 2 minutes. Whether you head to the beach after work, fly on holiday to Fiji, set the sails to cruise, collect abalone, or just want to clean your hull, AirBuddy is the perfect companion for your shallow water diving. AirBuddy sparked interest in many divers who have been supporting us in the last years - performing beta tests, providing ideas and feedback and helping to spread the word about AirBuddy. Here is what some of them say: Fun fact: Did you know that corals tend to grow at relatively shallow depths where the sunlight still penetrates the water? That’s where you also find the majority of marine species that live off of the coral or seek protection in coral structures.That's why how much you see doesn’t depend on how deep, but how often you dive. Most of our best sightings occurred in depths of less than 12 metres.  Hence the dive depth we designed AirBuddy for. Voilà!!! (We shot all of these photos within this depth. See more on our Instagram). Share the fun & dive together with a buddy. You can either connect 2 divers to one AirBuddy (and get a 45min session, max depth 6m /20ft) or link 2 AirBuddies together (and get 45min session, max depth 12m /40ft). Two AirBuddies will float together in a formation that prevents a potential entanglement of the hoses. And even if the hoses cross one day, no worries - it doesn't stop the air flow. Making you safe is our first priority! With AirBuddy, you dive deep enough to explore the beauty of marine life, but not deep enough to run a serious risk of DCS (decompression sickness, aka ""bends""). Unless you dive more than 3 times in a row, which is unlikely as you'd need to swap 4 batteries, you still are within the NDL (no decompression limit), thus can surface in case of an emergency without any stops and risk of DCS.With shallow water diving, you are just seconds away from the surface. You can swim up if needed. An ascent from a shallow dive takes only about 20 sec from 6m/ 20ft to 40sec from 12m/ 40ft at the PADI recommended ascent rates.In an unlikely event of an emergency, you can use 2 backup systems before needing to perform CESA (controlled emergency swimming ascent):

Backup #1: Use 15L compressed emergency air contained in the red float/reservoir, which provides about 4-5 breaths at 12m depth to about 12-15 breaths when closer to surface at about 1m depth.

Backup #2: Use 100% redundant egressor/ pony bottle - size of your choice (purchased separately).

CESA: Swim towards the surface while slowly breathing out (making the ""aaaaaah"" sound).
Who can use AirBuddy? Anyone who can swim, feels comfortable in the water, is willing to learn and obey the diving rules and procedures and has no medical conditions preventing them from diving with compressed air.But at the end of the day, YOU are the ultimate guardian of your own safety. Proper dive training is crucial for your comfort and safety. Dive responsibly, know your limits and never go to a depth you don't feel comfortable ascending from in case of an emergency, certainly not without any 100% redundant back-up system. And remember, it is always a good idea to practise your first dives with AirBuddy in waist level water and then slowly progress as you gain more experience and confidence.AirBuddy comes with additional safety backup features and our online support system - watch our FREE instruction videos that explain the key diving principles and safety rules.More Safety Features:

(1) Large 15L air reservoir provides emergency air for safe return to the surface.

(2) Low battery level monitor and alarm starts sending out audible signals when the battery voltage drops below 11V (about 45 min of operation). This is the signal for you to ascend.

(3) Visible float and diving flag to mark your position to boats, fishermen, etc. 

(4) Detachable magnetic wristband with a switch to ensure that only you (the diver) can switch AirBuddy off. 

(5) Abrasion and kink resistant air hose made from strong polyurethane that limits the depth of your descend.

(6) Elaborate air ways with 3x snorkel assembly to prevent splash water reaching the compressor.

(7) Capsize protection to about 110° tilt with the weight mass in the lower section acting as a keel and an electronic system to prevent water ingress.
  AirBuddy comes with a charger so instead of complicated air tank refills, simply recharge the battery from a power outlet (battery is fully recharged in 3.5hrs) at home, on your boat or even a campervan - just like you do with your mobile or camera! For a second consecutive dive with AirBuddy, use an additional battery (that weighs only 2.9kg).And the best part? Your costs of operation are limited to the electricity you use (about $0.1 per recharge) and an occasional maintenance every few years (or round a hundred dives), meaning you save thousands of dollars over the lifetime of the gear. The battery is rated to retain more than 80% of its capacity even after 1,500 cycles!AirBuddy provides a flat cost structure. The gear costs and maintenance costs are comparable with mid-range SCUBA gear. The difference is that you don't pay any rental or air-refill costs (and logistics) each time you go diving. You just recharge the battery from a socket for about 10 cents. This makes diving affordable, with significant savings over the time. Fun fact: Surface-supplied diving (SSBA) has been around for longer than SCUBA, the first divers explored the sea bed in their funny looking dive suits with large brass helmets already back in the 19th century. We combined this almost 200-year old diving principle with the latest technologies, materials and innovations and created a compact, user-friendly unit.AirBuddy is unique in the way it's bridging the gap between snorkeling and SCUBA.

</div></div>","Relax in the 21st Century 
Nothing beats a spontaneous trip with friends to the beach, campgrounds, or a tailgate... until you realize you need to unpack the car.
Chairs, speakers, towels, tables, and coolers. My friends and I looked at all of the junk we were lugging around and thought: what if this could all be put into one sleek, lightweight package?

Meet Shaze.
For the last year, we've worked on condensing all of our favorite features into an all-in-one lounge chair perfect for the beach, your next tailgate, or your next camping trip.
Core Features

 

4 High-Quality Waterproof Speakers: Listen to music on the beach without worrying about your stereo, thanks to Shaze's IPX6 Waterproof Standard Rating. The video in our gallery shows off how good they sound!
USB Device Charger: For those moments when you need to post one more photo but your phone is on its last legs. Shaze's internal power bank can bring 4 dead cell phones back to 100%!
Drainable, Insulated Cooler: Never go thirsty or hungry again. Room for 6+ beverages and a couple of sandwiches, with durable fabric and a handy drain spigot to get rid of that ice water in seconds.
Secure Storage Box with Combination Lock: Never hide money in your shoe again. Shaze has a three-digit combination lockbox that can do a better job protecting your valuables than any backpack.
Stretchable Towel Holder: No more sandy towels... when it's time to dry off, grab it right off of your beach chair. Simple placement behind the chair headrest keeps it out of the way but within reach.

Our lounge has a weight capacity of 300 pounds, and the dimensions 19W x 30H x 26L. 
A Durable, Powerful Battery
Shaze's built-in, rechargeable 10,000 milliamp battery that lasts for more than 5 hours of continuous use, so you can keep your phone charged and speaker booming. All of the electronics work in extreme climates, including subzero temperatures and over 200 degrees Fahrenheit.      
It's also extremely easy to charge the battery, with a removable power bank so you don't have to set the chair up near outlets. We've also created a solar charging panel that plugs directly into the chair (more on that below). 
Light. Water-Resistant. Rust-Proof.

There's no use having all this tech if you can't carry it anywhere. Shaze weighs only 10 pounds and comes with two back straps, making it as easy to carry as a backpack.

Oh, and no worries at the beach. Shaze is water-resistant too.  

Three Awesome Colors
Shaze comes in three colors: Navy Blue, Camouflage, and Pastel Pink. Choose your color after checkout!
 

What We Need & What You Get

Now that we've finished the development process and brought Shaze to life, we're hoping you'll come along for the journey by helping us make it even better and fund our first round of production.
$25,000: Reduce Chair Weight
We have an extremely lightweight chair now at 10lbs, but we know we can do better. We are working on bringing that down at least 10% before we begin to ship.
$150,000: Extra Battery

Our solar panels were created to keep your Shaze battery charged all day without plugging it in (see the 'Perks' section). Making this solar panel smaller will allow it to stay permanently attached to your chair.
If we reach our stretch goal of $150,000 every order that was placed gets an extra 5,000 Mah battery built specifically for the Shaze lounge chair.

 

Perks
We've got a few great options for people who want to help us with this project. 

Early Bird Pricing: Get it while it's hot! Early backers will get the Shaze chair at only $55, half of the estimated retail cost.
Personalized Pillow: Make Shaze your own with a personal monogram. Initials, team names, phrases, or whatever else you want can be monogrammed onto the pillow of your chair.

Attachable Table: We've developed a special table that fits onto the Shaze chair like a glove. Available in the Deluxe Edition Package.

Solar Panel: Stay charged up all day with an attachable solar panel. Available in the Deluxe Edition Package.

Nala: Just kidding. You can't have Nala.

A unique harness-style system, created by 2 dads and developed based on the latest information from the biomechanics and accident research field. WhizRider is perfect for urban families who use ride-sharing apps and taxis, suburban carpooling and unexpected pick-ups, as well as family travel. Awards For Excellence...   Featured In...   WhizRider offers innovative safety features: Did you know......that many countries outside the USA accept the U.S. standard, have exceptional cases or do not have child safety requirements? For example:

Asia (Hong Kong, Japan, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, Vietnam etc)

South Asia (India, Sri Lanka etc)

Latin America (Argentina, Chile, Columbia, Ecuador, Mexico, Peru etc)

European countries have exceptional cases for the use of Taxis (Belgium, France, Ireland, Italy, Netherland, Portugal, Spain, United Kingdom*)*including the use of uber services (private hire vehicles)

  Although renting a car seat or booster may seem convenient, it can often be expensive enough to put a damper on your travel budget. They could be damaged or improperly cleaned—or maybe never cleaned. Keeping WhizRider on you means never having to wonder about your child’s safety in the car, even when you are traveling far from home. Never worry about where the car seat is again! Whether you are asking your partner to pick up the kids from school, or a friend wants to bring your child home from soccer practice, there will be no more frustrating realizations that they don’t have a safe way to ride in the car. Having WhizRider in your child’s backpack or your glove compartment or handbag means you are always prepared. Single car family? Frequent car-sharing riders? With WhizRider you are free to explore your city again—without dragging a car seat along. Take a spontaneous trip to the museum with an Uber, or hop in a friend’s car and grab lunch. Imagine the experiences that will open up for you and your children when bulky car seat logistics aren’t standing in your way. The standard advice when leaving children in someone else’s care is to install the car seat in the nanny or babysitter’s car. Even if they don’t plan on leaving, it is important to have a safe way to travel with the children in case of an emergency. What if they already had the solution on them? A nanny, babysitter, grandparent, or other caregiver who has a WhizRider stowed in their glove compartment or handbag is always ready for a car ride.   From San Francisco to Vietnam to Morocco, families have been testing out WhizRider and have loved the convenience of traveling safely on holiday and around town. We look forward to posting your WhizKids' stories!!    We designed and developed WhizRider together with leading accident researchers, biomechanical engineers, and mountain climbing experts, among other experts in the fields of personal protection equipment. It is a unique harness system that guides the car seat belt into the proper position on the lap and shoulder to prevent injury. WhizRider is absolutely safe and fits in a pocket or backpack so it can always be there for your child’s safety.Our research led us to innovative concepts that redefine what a safe child restraint solution can look and feel like. Although WhizRider is ultra-portable, it does not compromise on safety.Major Safety Features That Reduce The Risk of  Injury

No Submarining: Leg loops prevent children from “submarining” under the lap belt or sliding forward.

Optimal Seat Belt Placement: Innovative metal clips keep the seat belt in correct position, even when children wiggle or fall asleep.

Extra Visibility: Glow-in-the-dark vest keeps kids safe at night.
  Installing WhizRider is a simple process, helping you feel confident that your child is securely restrained for every ride. Age and Size RequirementsWhizRider is offered in 2 sizes (small and large) and is adjustable to fit children from ages 3 to 10 years old:   You can see in this video how the innovative design of the WhizRider vest reduces the risk of injury and keeps the seat belt at optimum placement.WhizRider has undergone rigorous crash testing and surpasses the requirements of the U.S. Federal Standard, regulated by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). These regulations include:
Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS) 213 for Child Restraint Systems
Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS) 302 for Flammability of Interior Materials
 Crash TestsThe most important elements of a crash test video to determine safety of a restraint system both involve how much movement takes place:
How far does the dummy move forward in the seat (whether knee excursion or submarining under the lap belt).
How much the dummy’s head moves forward (forward excursion).
If you focus on the dummy’s head and knees in this actual crash test footage, you can see that WhizRider holds the dummy’s body in a secure position through the duration of the impact.Through a random selection method, every single batch we produce is tested in accordance with FMVSS 213. We repeat these tests using dummies that represent three-year-old, six-year-old, and ten-year-old children. For additional security, we have been conducting tests in different testing facilities across the U.S. and Europe.  The Two Main Performance Benchmarks Knee Forward Movement Comparison:
U.S. Federal Standards allow the child’s knees to travel 36” forward.
In crash testing, WhizRider allows the knees to move forward 20”.
Head Forward Movement Comparison:
U.S. Federal Standards allow the child’s head to travel 32” forward. 
In crash testing, WhizRider allows the head to move forward 11”.
            As two fathers living in big cities with our families, we were frustrated we couldn’t find a suitable solution to secure our children in daily taxis and Ubers. Lugging along clunky car seats was inconvenient, but going without a car seat or booster was out of the question. From this frustration we were inspired to create WhizRider, a car seat you can always have on you.Both of us are members of the Swiss Alpine Club (the largest mountaineering club in Switzerland) as well as parents, so we instinctively focus on the quality, safety, and sustainability of the products our families use. The inspiration for the innovative design of the WhizRider vest comes from the safety features found on a climbing harness.Our younger kids feel like heroes when wearing their WhizRider safety vests and won’t take them off. Our older kid likes that it enables spontaneous city strolls and trips for the whole family. Now we’re excited to share WhizRider with you and families around the world.If your child is between 3 and 10 years old, WhizRider will work for you. If you like the freedom of unplanned adventures, using Uber, jumping in a taxi, or want a convenient and safe option for getting around with your kids, then your answer is here.

</div></div>","INTRODUCING
The Booe Hybrid 20 Waterproof Backpack
The first 100% waterproof, submersible, airtight, and floating backpack engineered with new TRU Zip™ Waterproof Zippers. This 20 liter waterproof backpack has you covered whether you’re heading out on the boat, hanging out at the beach, or commuting to the office. From the beach to city streets, keep your things safe, dry, and protected from the elements.
 

 
Capacity: 20 liters        Weight: 2.34 lbs        Height: 17.9""        Width: 11.8""        Depth: 5.9""
 


TRU Zip™ Waterproof Zippers
A NEW Revolution in Zipper Technology
The patented TRU Zip™ design is the first silent, sliding, toothless, and TRUly waterproof zipper system on the market. This complete zipper system introduces a fully-closed assembly that can be RF welded in applications that were never possible before. With an intuitive pull-to-close design that secures into an overmolded garage, TRU Zip™ offers a confident closure you can feel.
 

 

""TRU-Zip is the best innovation I’ve found in the entire outdoor industry in at least the past 5 years.""
 

""TRU Zip technology represents the industry’s first toothless, waterproof zipper. Using the same extrusion methods behind the brand’s Gear Ties, the TRU Zip is airtight, resists snagging your gear, and repairs itself.”
 

""When the “TRU Zip” head docks into the depression at the far end, the soft bag is absolutely airtight: putting a solid hundred pounds of force on the top didn’t produce so much as a squeak.”
 

“[TRU ZIP] is completely waterproof — not just water-resistant, as many zippers billed as “waterproof” are — and doesn’t use the teeth that have defined what we think of as zippers for the last 125 years. The zipper closes with a design reminiscent of a Ziploc bag but is much stronger — strong enough to stand on one of the packing cubes without the zipper bursting”
 

""This new zipper uses no teeth and no coils. Unlike a seal that you press into place, like that found on zip-loc bags, this is based on an interlocking ball and socket rail design—pull the zipper and the rails lock into place. Both the mechanical action of the locking rails and a vacuum effect created when the zipper closes keeps these suckers sealed.""

<h3>HELP OUR NEIGHBORS IN LONG BEACH</h3>
In the aftermath of Sandy, cities like Long Beach, NY have been absolutely devastated. Personal loss of life and property has been devastating. The entire cost of this storm is already estimated to be at least $60 billion. Many of us have friends &amp; family there, or simply go to Long Beach to enjoy the beach, the fun bars, and the great people. Many of us in other cities have also suffered great loss, but in many cases not as bad as Long Beach.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>To those who can show their support, please consider doing so!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Please consider how much even a couple of dollars can help soften the blow and help people in need get back on their feet. Money will not replace the loss for many of these people, but many of them now will need shelter and food in the coming cold months of winter. Not everybody has family to go to.</div>
<div> </div>
<h3>WHAT HAPPENS WITH THIS MONEY</h3>
<p>This is not an official charity, and I am only one Long Island resident trying to do what I can to help. Once we have met or exceeded our goal of $500,00 and the campaign has been funded, I will contact the City of Long Beach (<a href=""http://www.longbeachny.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.longbeachny.org/</a>).

Have you got a patent on it?</strong></h3><p>We knew you'd ask! And yes, MICRO is patent pending.</p><h3><strong>Are the pictures displayed on the campaign page of the final version of MICRO?</strong></h3><p>The footage on this page is of the final MICRO prototype. We will extend every effort to ensure the final version will be very close to this, although changes in design, functionality and materials might take place when optimising the design for certification and mass production.</p><h3><strong>I want to order multiple MICROs.</strong></h3><p>That's great! Check out some of our higher tiers that offer the number of units you wish to purchase.</p><h3><strong>What is the cost of shipping to my country?</strong></h3><p>MICRO will be delivered worldwide and the shipping cost is uniform for each ties, irrespective of the country you are from. To find out the shipping cost to your country, choose the tier you wish to pledge for and click on it. Once you've filled in your shipping details, Indiegogo will automatically display the shipping cost that will be added to your pledge. And the good news is: the higher the tier you pledge for, the lower the shipping cost.</p><h3><strong>Can MICRO be used in 13A sockets?</strong></h3><p>MICRO will be approved for up to 250V at 6.3A so it can be used with your regular gadgets (i.e. smart phone, tablet, etc.) in any country MICRO is compatible with.</p><h3><strong>What standards has MICRO been tested for?</strong></h3><p>After the InDemand campaign ends, MICRO will be tested according to CE and RoHs standards - the standards that travel adapter industry leaders follow. The testing is done by authorised laboratories to ensure MICRO meets all safety standards under normal use. MICRO has been designed to meet your requirements and allow you to use it worldwide without concern.</p><h3><strong>Does MICRO slouch if used with heavier plugs?</strong></h3><p>We've tested MICRO with plugs of all sizes. In fact, in the videos and photos displayed, we’ve used predominantly a UK plug because it is the heaviest. And as you can see, the results speak for themselves. However it is good to remember that the inside build of each socket is an important factor in how well MICRO holds.</p><h3><strong>What is MICRO made of?</strong></h3><p>MICRO is made of fire-retardant ABS, brass and environmentally friendly silicone.</p><h3><strong>Why do I have to plug MICRO upside down in Australia?</strong></h3><p>MICRO is plugged upside down in Australia to keep the correct plug-socket polarity in place. As a comparison, the European round pin socket has the Live connector on the right side, while the Australia socket has the Live connector on the left side.</p><h3><strong>What if I lose the modular pieces?</strong></h3><p>Although MICRO is modular, we’ve made sure to fit every component snuggly in the compact design. That makes the possibility of losing the modular pieces highly unlikely.</p><h3><strong>Do you guarantee delivery of my reward on or before December 2017?</strong></h3><p>While we will do our best to deliver all the rewards as soon as possible, it’s good to remember that some processes during mass production are not fully within our control and as such, the delivery date is not an absolute guarantee.</p><p>Also, because our Kickstarter backers have played an essential role in getting our project off the ground, we will be shipping their rewards first as a token of appreciation for their support early on. </p><p>We value your support just as much and we will do our best to avoid any unnecessary delays so we can have your MICRO delivered to you as soon as possible.  </p><p>That being said, we’ve been very conservative in setting the delivery date. That’s because we’d rather exceed your expectations and deliver early than face delaying challenges and disappoint you.</p><p>One thing we can assure you of: we’ll maintain complete transparency and will communicate with you through all stages of manufacturing so you are always aware of the progress.</p><h3><strong>What shipping method will you use to send my reward?</strong></h3><p>We will use different couriers to ship to different countries, depending on the most efficient options. Please note each country has different import procedures and the custom clearance formalities may cause delivery delays that we have no control over.</p><h3><strong>What if my MICRO(s) arrived damaged?</strong></h3><p>According to statistics, 1% of all products shipped annually worldwide reach their destination damaged or faulty in some way due to mishandling.</p><p>We’ve done our due diligence and partnered with a highly qualified fulfilment centre to process all Indiegogo orders and ship your pledge efficiently and with the utmost care.</p><p>Nonetheless, in the unlikely situation your MICRO arrives damaged or faulty in any way, we will do our best to replace it as fast as possible.</p><h3><strong>Will I have to pay duties/VAT to receive my reward?</strong></h3><p>Because we ship globally and duties/taxes are different in each country, we cannot retain additional duties/VAT in a manner that is accurate and/or fair for each backer. Any applicable duties/VAT are therefore the responsibility of each backer. If any duties are applicable, these may be charged at the time of receiving the package.</p><p>To check whether or not there are duties/VAT charged at the time of receiving your reward, please contact your local post office.</p><h3><strong>What is your refund policy?</strong></h3><p>Once the campaign ends or your card is charged, your pledge (which we are extremely grateful for!) is immediately used to fire up the machines so MICRO gets delivered to you as soon as possible. For this reason, we cannot offer refunds to backers once their cards have been charged. In the very unlikely situation of a defective reward being shipped out, we will do our best to rectify the situation as soon as possible and in a manner that is satisfactory to you.</p><h3><strong>Does MICRO have a USB port?</strong></h3><p>MICRO doesn't have a USB port. Based on market research, people's biggest problem was that the adapters on the market are either small single socket ones, or they are universal and very bulky. Many of the adapters coming with a USB were slow-charging and ineffective.</p><p>Additionally the electronic components currently available on the market aren't small enough to allow for another function (i.e. USB port) while also maintaining MICRO’s small and compact design.</p><p>The most common gadgets people own/travel with are: mobile phones and laptop computers. Laptops come with USB ports as standard, so let’s address the issue of mobile phones.</p><p>When you buy any gadget that uses a USB port, it comes with a USB cable and a plug that fits the country you bought it from.</p><p>The market told us to create the world's smallest universal travel adapter solution that gives everybody the ability to adapt their plugs to any socket in the world, and look cool at the same time.</p><h3><strong>Got a question we haven't answered in our FAQs?</strong></h3><p>You are welcome to email us anytime at info@kickstartsuccess.co and one of our team members will get back to you with the answer faster than Usain Bolt runs 100m.</p></div>","HERE IS A SNEAK PEAK OF MICRO's NEW SEXY DESIGN

Please note each country has different import procedures and the custom clearance formalities may cause delivery delays that we have no control over.What if my MICRO(s) arrived damaged?According to statistics, 1% of all products shipped annually worldwide reach their destination damaged or faulty in some way due to mishandling.We’ve done our due diligence and partnered with a highly qualified fulfilment centre to process all Indiegogo orders and ship your pledge efficiently and with the utmost care.Nonetheless, in the unlikely situation your MICRO arrives damaged or faulty in any way, we will do our best to replace it as fast as possible.Will I have to pay duties/VAT to receive my reward?Because we ship globally and duties/taxes are different in each country, we cannot retain additional duties/VAT in a manner that is accurate and/or fair for each backer. Any applicable duties/VAT are therefore the responsibility of each backer. If any duties are applicable, these may be charged at the time of receiving the package.To check whether or not there are duties/VAT charged at the time of receiving your reward, please contact your local post office.What is your refund policy?Once the campaign ends or your card is charged, your pledge (which we are extremely grateful for!) is immediately used to fire up the machines so MICRO gets delivered to you as soon as possible. For this reason, we cannot offer refunds to backers once their cards have been charged. In the very unlikely situation of a defective reward being shipped out, we will do our best to rectify the situation as soon as possible and in a manner that is satisfactory to you.Does MICRO have a USB port?MICRO doesn't have a USB port. Based on market research, people's biggest problem was that the adapters on the market are either small single socket ones, or they are universal and very bulky. Many of the adapters coming with a USB were slow-charging and ineffective.Additionally the electronic components currently available on the market aren't small enough to allow for another function (i.e. USB port) while also maintaining MICRO’s small and compact design.The most common gadgets people own/travel with are: mobile phones and laptop computers. Laptops come with USB ports as standard, so let’s address the issue of mobile phones.When you buy any gadget that uses a USB port, it comes with a USB cable and a plug that fits the country you bought it from.The market told us to create the world's smallest universal travel adapter solution that gives everybody the ability to adapt their plugs to any socket in the world, and look cool at the same time.Got a question we haven't answered in our FAQs?You are welcome to email us anytime at info@kickstartsuccess.co and one of our team members will get back to you with the answer faster than Usain Bolt runs 100m.",34.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p><b>Extended Battery Life</b><br/>A 2800mAh lithium-ion battery is safely equipped in a battery slot located behind the neck. One full charge provides 23 hours of use when only in call stand-by mode. Even when operating all functionalities (call stand-by, music playback &amp; recording) simultaneously, PLY can be used for 4+ continuous hours. At the low-battery threshold PLY automatically enters BT extension mode, for an additional 8 hours of call stand-by. Capable of reaching full charge in 3.5 ~ max 5 hours depending on simultaneous use, PLY is charged simply through any micro USB cable.</p>

  Integrated HD Dash Cam   PLY’s patented HD dash cam is embedded near the chin for incredible shot stability & shoots stunning 120° rider viewpoint footage. With HD (1280x720) resolution, 30 fps and a 1/3 inch sensor, PLY provide clear footage with no additional accessories/add-ons required. Accident Record (Action Cam Function) In the unfortunate event of an accident, insurance and liability can depend on who can prove fault. PLY can record tangible video proof, utilizing the action cam function to record unexpected events that occur on the road. Hands-Free Calls   With an embedded speaker and mic, PLY allows riders to sync their smart phone audio to their helmet over Bluetooth. Take hands-free calls by pushing the take-call button once. Keep your grip on the handle for enhanced safety while communicating with your fellow riders.Hear and be heard clearly on the road with active wind and traffic-noise cancelling. Always stay connected, even when out for a long ride.Bluetooth Audio Navigation & Music Playback  Compatible with your favorite navigation app, connect to Bluetooth to hear real-time directions to your final destination. With audio guidance, keep your focus on the road ahead. When connected to Bluetooth you can also listen to your favorite music, radio station or podcast. If a call is incoming, simply push the take-call button to answer and the music will pause. End the call and music will automatically resume playing. Noise Reduction for Sound Quality Motorcycles at high speeds create loud wind noise. Wind noise resonates mainly in the low frequency bandwidth while the friction of wind against objects resonates primarily in the high frequencies. In PLY noise reduction technology is utilized to equalize both sound on the low and high frequency bandwidth allowing the human voice to be heard and spoken loud and clearly. Unlike headphones, helmets differ in position and distance from their ears, so in order to provide the best sound while driving, the helmet must be tuned to find the optimal sound.




Extended Battery LifeA 2800mAh lithium-ion battery is safely equipped in a battery slot located behind the neck. One full charge provides 23 hours of use when only in call stand-by mode. Even when operating all functionalities (call stand-by, music playback & recording) simultaneously, PLY can be used for 4+ continuous hours. At the low-battery threshold PLY automatically enters BT extension mode, for an additional 8 hours of call stand-by. Capable of reaching full charge in 3.5 ~ max 5 hours depending on simultaneous use, PLY is charged simply through any micro USB cable.

Control UXControlled by an intuitive 3-button control, PLY can be handled with minimal use of the hands. The Power button toggles On/Off while also controlling video recording. The Front Button toggles between BT/WiFi depending on your connectivity needs. The Back Button controls Bluetooth audio and call answering.
 
 
 Air Circulation for ComfortPLY has two vents in the front to allow for the inflow of cool air: one above the forehead and one beside the chin for upper and lower ventilation. Combined they provide for maximum air intake. Wide rear vents allow for the exhaust of warm air so you stay cool and comfortable. 
 Protective Sun Visor & ShieldEquipped with a fog, scratch and glare resistant sun visor, PLY keeps road vision clear and unimpeded. The visor handle can raise and lower the visor based on visibility needs. A full-face, flip-up shield provides a secondary layer of protection. Currently designed as a transparent screen, a smoke (tinted)  and silver chrome (mirror) shield are also in development. Shields can be removed or interchanged as needed.  




 FOTA (Firmware On The Air)  
Through FOTA, the operating firmware for PLY can be upgraded wirelessly. FOTA will allow for remote bug repairs, software updates, and even the unveiling of additional new features

Worum geht es bei diesem Projekt „Grüner Tourismus“
¿De qué trata el proyecto ""turismo verde""?

Grüner Tourismus bedeutet Nachhalitgkeit. Bei unserem Projekt geht um einen nachhaltigen Tourismus auf der schönsten Insel der Welt, Mallorca. Jährlich besuchen mehr als 13 Millionen Touristen die Insel, wobei mehr als 50% auf Autos und Roller zurückgreifen, um die Insel zu erkunden.
Die dadurch entstehende Umweltbelastung und der Co2 Ausstoß sind extrem hoch, sodass die Lebensqualität auf Mallorca stark beeinträchtigt wird. Das wollen wir von BikeKing ändern und in den nächsten Jahren zu 100 % auf Elektrofahrzeuge umrüsten. Bis zum Jahr 2025 wollen wir zu 100 % auf die Elektrovermietung setzen und die Marke BikeKing als Marktführer und Pionier etablieren.
Neben unserem Hauptstandort in Can Pastilla sollen in der Zukunft weitere Standorte in Palma Zentrum Palma Hafen, im Süd-Westen und im Norden der Insel entstehen.
Des Weiteren planen wir bis 2025 einen mit Solar,- und Windenergie betriebenen Parkplatz für unsere Fahrzeugflotte zu errichten.

<p><strong>WHY IS RADPAK DIFFERENT / BETTER?</strong></p>
<p>HERE'S ONE OF THE REASONS...AND IT'S BIG  </p>
<p>900D Ballistic Nylon was developed for backpacks in late 2018. It's development was a push from backpack manufacturers to gain military contracts. Proving to be much stronger than Cordura and Polyester, Nylon 900D will become the material of choice for bags of the future.  But guess what? The future is now!</p>
<p>900D Nylon is already replacing the commonly used 600D Nylon for the military.  Its impenetrable design stops moisture to keep gear protected at all times.  And, 900D has been pressure tested to prevent tearing at 291 Newtons of force per square inch!  That's a lot of Newtons! </p>
<p>900D Ballistic Nylon is the backpack material of the future.  RADPAK has it...NOW!  </p>

MountnGo, GoScope and Stratacous have market presence and backers and supporters in excess of 50,000.  And we've heard from a lot of them who, in a nutshell have told us, ""Hey, we need a backpack that is rugged and water resistant and can fit our clothing and gear plus some of our toys, like drones and cameras.  Oh, and it's gotta be carry-on size...and it can't be super expensive.""</p>

<p>As project leader, MountnGo the company (<a href=""http://www.mountngo.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.mountngo.com</a>), was first conceived with the knowledge that there are so many people out there taking life to another level~ squeezing the absolute most out of every day.  We wanted to make products especially for them...and we did. Our first products were not backpacks at all, but rather all-weather mounts for phones and tablets that can be taken anywhere people want to use digital devices.

<p style=""text-align: center;"">STRAT WITH HIS MAN'S BEST FRIEND, ZONDERVAN.</p>
<p>Q.  How would you describe what you do?</p>
<p>A.  I travel the world and live life to the absolute fullest.  </p>
<p>Q.  And why does this resonate with so many people?  </p>
<p>A.  Everyone wants to travel and leave the reality they’re in.  Sometimes people have excuses as to why they can’t do it and thus they live vicariously through me.  But I want to take one of those excuses away so anyone can be ready, anytime, whether it's for one hour, one day, a few weeks or a year, to pick up and just go LIVE!  RADPAK will help them be prepared to do just that.  </p>
<p>Q. What will hitting or exceeding your financial goals mean for you?</p>
<p> A. I hope this doesn't sound too corny...but I really love inspiring people to get up off the couch, maybe ease up a bit on their gaming (laughs), try new things--experience some of what I have experienced. I've found being prepared and organized is ultra-important.  With RADPAK, I want people to feel like they're ready to go, anytime, so travel becomes less hassle, more adventure.  So hitting our financial goal means I've helped a lot of people to experience life in a way they may have always dreamed.</p>

<p>Here's what people are saying about our prototype.... </p>
<p>""When I heard you were doing this I thought to myself, 'this is going to be epic' Aaaaand it is.  It looks as if you’ve thought of everything for the design - accessible pockets, organization, comfort, weather resistance - all the things."" </p>
<p>""I like that name RADPAK. The zipper seal keep water and moisture out is an immediate must have. The suitcase aspect of it is so cool. Love how much it can hold gear, and stuff. Side pockets, USB port, it can do and hold just about anything you want. Wow I really want this backpack.﻿""</p>
<p>""I love having safe compartments for all my photography gear--even my drone.  It's amazing!"" </p>
<p>""I've gone through a ton of backpacks...this one seems really durable has pretty much just what I need.  Seems like they've thought of everything!""   </p>
<p>""One thing it has that I always look for, this sounds silly but a padded waist strap that has storage pockets. To me that is so important. Glad to see this one has them on both sides. It looks perfect for all my camera needs, GoPro, Insta360, Canon, and DJI. l'll be checking this out!﻿"" </p>

<p>GO BALLISTIC!  </p>
<p>NEW, 900D BALLISTIC NYLON MATERIAL PUTS RADPAK ON A WHOLE NEW LEVEL.  </p>
<p>IT'S RIDICULOUSLY DURABLE AND COMFORTABLE.</p>
<p>Another few words on 900D:  The ""D"" in 900D stands for ""denier."" The higher the ""D,"" the stronger the fabric.  It does not directly correlate to thread count or weight (as in how much the fabric weighs). So comparatively 900D fabric is stronger than 600D, which is stronger than 400D, etc., but it doesn't weigh more.</p>

<p>BREAKTHROUGH MATERIAL: NO OTHER CONSUMER BACKPACKS OUT THERE THAT WE KNOW OF ARE MADE WITH THIS NEW, 900D BALLISTIC NYLON. IT'S LIGHT, IT'S MILITARY-GRADE DURABLE, IT'S WATER RESISTANT, AND IT LOOKS AMAZING.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>With the Stratacous Series RADPAK by MountNGo, we've designed the world's most durable backpack for travelers, adventurers, and photographers with the latest in high tech features. RADPAK will prove to be the most powerful tool in your arsenal of gear. </p>
<p>Whether it's hiking the Kalalau Trail in Hawaii, braving the corkscrew climb up Ancient Art in Utah, or simply just heading out for the day, RADPAK has you covered! </p>
<p>Our team noticed that too many bags seemed to have been designed by people sitting behind computers. So we decided to hand the drawing board over to adrenaline junkie STRATACOUS (Strat). Strat designed the bag to be superior on every level. No matter the environment, no matter the adventure, he has created  a truly remarkable backpack! </p>
<p>RADPAK allows you to pack in a ton of clothing, and  be drone, SLR, and GoPro ready at all times with easy access compartments to your most essential gear. You decide the configuration of the bag to meet your needs. </p>
<p>Waterproof zippers and nylon wicking fabric prevent moisture from entering the pack. Need extra protection? RADPACK comes standard with an integrated rain fly tested to hold back the fiercest rain. Ski, snowboard and skateboard straps maximize carrying capacity, while padded straps and compartments carry bulky gear without loading you down. </p>
<p>Ever struggle to charge your electronics on the go?  RADPAK comes with an integrated, water-resistant USB connection for hooking up to your external battery supply. Charge your gear without opening the bag, it's that easy!  Be prepared.  Be organize.  Be RAD.   --RADPAK Team--</p>
<p><strong>Here's what makes it perfect for travelers, photographers and adventurers! </strong></p>
<p>Long trips, short trips, doesn’t matter...</p>
<p>- Ballistic 900D nylon exterior with rip- stop stress points (water resistant)  </p>
<p>- Integrated external USB connection for power devices outside of pack</p>

HERE'S ONE OF THE REASONS...AND IT'S BIG  
900D Ballistic Nylon was developed for backpacks in late 2018. It's development was a push from backpack manufacturers to gain military contracts. Proving to be much stronger than Cordura and Polyester, Nylon 900D will become the material of choice for bags of the future.  But guess what? The future is now!
900D Nylon is already replacing the commonly used 600D Nylon for the military.  Its impenetrable design stops moisture to keep gear protected at all times.  And, 900D has been pressure tested to prevent tearing at 291 Newtons of force per square inch!  That's a lot of Newtons! 
900D Ballistic Nylon is the backpack material of the future.  RADPAK has it...NOW!

PERFECT FOR THE ADVENTURER/TRAVELER IN ALL OF US.

SECURE YOUR SNOWBOARD, SKIS OR SKATEBOARD...

...OR WHATEVER MAKES FOR YOUR FAVORITE ADVENTURE!


 
Salt Lake City, Utah - February 7, 2019 -- Lesley Murphy, star of The Bachelor, rocks the RADPAK backpack in Deer Valley, Utah! 

The RADPAK is a stylish bag but Lesley Murphy makes it look truly stunning!
We are absolutely thrilled to announce that a friend of RADPAK has agreed to lend her support.  Someone who will need no introduction for many of you, welcome Lesley Murphy! 
You may recognize Lesley from the popular television show ""The Bachelor"". She's an icon to many not just from her days on the hit television show but her bravery to undergo a double mastectomy. Her mother is a breast cancer survivor and after testing positive for the BRCA2 gene, Lesley underwent the preventative surgery. Today, she runs a luxury travel blog ""The Road Les Traveled"". Her travels take her to so many amazing places around the globe. In this photo she sports the Stratacous Series RADPAK by MountnGo on her skiing adventures in Deer Valley Utah!
So on we all go, with the rest of our adventure!
--RADPAK TEAM--





The RADPAK team has evolved by taking the best from three separate companies and melding them into one, to create the RADPAK backpack. MountnGo, GoScope and Stratacous have market presence and backers and supporters in excess of 50,000.  And we've heard from a lot of them who, in a nutshell have told us, ""Hey, we need a backpack that is rugged and water resistant and can fit our clothing and gear plus some of our toys, like drones and cameras.  Oh, and it's gotta be carry-on size...and it can't be super expensive.""

As project leader, MountnGo the company (www.mountngo.com), was first conceived with the knowledge that there are so many people out there taking life to another level~ squeezing the absolute most out of every day.  We wanted to make products especially for them...and we did. Our first products were not backpacks at all, but rather all-weather mounts for phones and tablets that can be taken anywhere people want to use digital devices. And, our working relationship with GoPro's Software Developer Program helped us create the first app in the world that remotely voice controls any GoPro camera ever made. You can find ""theverbapp"" in the Apple App Store.  So we've had the hearts and minds of travelers and adventurers in our sights right from the start.
But the driving force behind RADPAK, is Stratacous.  ""Strat"" lives what RADPAK is all about, every day!

STRAT WITH HIS MAN'S BEST FRIEND, ZONDERVAN.
Q.  How would you describe what you do?
A.  I travel the world and live life to the absolute fullest.  
Q.  And why does this resonate with so many people?  
A.  Everyone wants to travel and leave the reality they’re in.  Sometimes people have excuses as to why they can’t do it and thus they live vicariously through me.  But I want to take one of those excuses away so anyone can be ready, anytime, whether it's for one hour, one day, a few weeks or a year, to pick up and just go LIVE!  RADPAK will help them be prepared to do just that.  
Q. What will hitting or exceeding your financial goals mean for you?
 A. I hope this doesn't sound too corny...but I really love inspiring people to get up off the couch, maybe ease up a bit on their gaming (laughs), try new things--experience some of what I have experienced. I've found being prepared and organized is ultra-important.  With RADPAK, I want people to feel like they're ready to go, anytime, so travel becomes less hassle, more adventure.  So hitting our financial goal means I've helped a lot of people to experience life in a way they may have always dreamed.



Here's what people are saying about our prototype.... 
""When I heard you were doing this I thought to myself, 'this is going to be epic' Aaaaand it is.  It looks as if you’ve thought of everything for the design - accessible pockets, organization, comfort, weather resistance - all the things."" 
""I like that name RADPAK. The zipper seal keep water and moisture out is an immediate must have. The suitcase aspect of it is so cool. Love how much it can hold gear, and stuff. Side pockets, USB port, it can do and hold just about anything you want. Wow I really want this backpack.﻿""
""I love having safe compartments for all my photography gear--even my drone.  It's amazing!"" 
""I've gone through a ton of backpacks...this one seems really durable has pretty much just what I need.  Seems like they've thought of everything!""   
""One thing it has that I always look for, this sounds silly but a padded waist strap that has storage pockets. To me that is so important. Glad to see this one has them on both sides. It looks perfect for all my camera needs, GoPro, Insta360, Canon, and DJI. l'll be checking this out!﻿"" 

GO BALLISTIC!  
NEW, 900D BALLISTIC NYLON MATERIAL PUTS RADPAK ON A WHOLE NEW LEVEL.  
IT'S RIDICULOUSLY DURABLE AND COMFORTABLE.
Another few words on 900D:  The ""D"" in 900D stands for ""denier."" The higher the ""D,"" the stronger the fabric.  It does not directly correlate to thread count or weight (as in how much the fabric weighs). So comparatively 900D fabric is stronger than 600D, which is stronger than 400D, etc., but it doesn't weigh more.

BREAKTHROUGH MATERIAL: NO OTHER CONSUMER BACKPACKS OUT THERE THAT WE KNOW OF ARE MADE WITH THIS NEW, 900D BALLISTIC NYLON. IT'S LIGHT, IT'S MILITARY-GRADE DURABLE, IT'S WATER RESISTANT, AND IT LOOKS AMAZING.
 
With the Stratacous Series RADPAK by MountNGo, we've designed the world's most durable backpack for travelers, adventurers, and photographers with the latest in high tech features. RADPAK will prove to be the most powerful tool in your arsenal of gear. 
Whether it's hiking the Kalalau Trail in Hawaii, braving the corkscrew climb up Ancient Art in Utah, or simply just heading out for the day, RADPAK has you covered! 
Our team noticed that too many bags seemed to have been designed by people sitting behind computers. So we decided to hand the drawing board over to adrenaline junkie STRATACOUS (Strat). Strat designed the bag to be superior on every level. No matter the environment, no matter the adventure, he has created  a truly remarkable backpack! 
RADPAK allows you to pack in a ton of clothing, and  be drone, SLR, and GoPro ready at all times with easy access compartments to your most essential gear. You decide the configuration of the bag to meet your needs. 
Waterproof zippers and nylon wicking fabric prevent moisture from entering the pack. Need extra protection? RADPACK comes standard with an integrated rain fly tested to hold back the fiercest rain. Ski, snowboard and skateboard straps maximize carrying capacity, while padded straps and compartments carry bulky gear without loading you down. 
Ever struggle to charge your electronics on the go?  RADPAK comes with an integrated, water-resistant USB connection for hooking up to your external battery supply. Charge your gear without opening the bag, it's that easy!  Be prepared.  Be organize.  Be RAD.   --RADPAK Team--
Here's what makes it perfect for travelers, photographers and adventurers! 
Long trips, short trips, doesn’t matter...
- Ballistic 900D nylon exterior with rip- stop stress points (water resistant)  
- Integrated external USB connection for power devices outside of pack
- Rain fly with reversible design to hold shoulder straps and waist straps while traveling
- Honeycomb neoprene custom molded backing (breathable and sweat resistant)
- Snowboard/skateboard carrying straps and side load ski carrying straps 
- Molly webbing, D-rings, and added water bottle mesh compartment    
- Security band for connecting to roller bag trolley handle   
- Even load weight distributing dual shoulder strap design 
- And it's TSA carry-on compliant!

STRAT STREETMAN: Was born and raised on the gulf of Mississippi.  Strat grew up skateboarding and skimboarding and started traveling after graduating in 2009.  This ignited his love for travel, adventure, and photography! He moved to Utah and joined DevinSuperTramp as a stunt athlete in 2013.  He has traveled to 47 states and 32 countries since. His goal is to inspire people to find and do what they love. He will be moving to Hawaii in May to start doing coral restoration to help save the oceans. 

KYLE SCAROLA:  Born and raised in South Florida, Kyle has spent most of his life on a tropical adventure. His addiction to the ocean is only shadowed by his passion for film making. In 2011, Kyle quit his 9-5 and started his own camera accessories company called GoScope.  For 7 years he's been running the Denver, NC based company. He's designed a wide range of accessories for Action Cameras, Mirrorless SLR Cameras, and Drone Quadcopters. Kyle's focus over the past three years has been concentrated in the drone market place. He's designed top-selling Specialty Backpacks and cases for DJI drones. Being a consumer himself, product development comes naturally to Kyle as he applies various inventions to real-world applications. ""We are always improving engineering methods to stay ahead of the competition.""    


ALLEN TAIT, BROCK TREDWAY, DAVE TOMER:  It's all about work/life balance, right?  We know it's incriminating with the beach in the background, but we do hold up the business end of this adventure. We've all got extensive financial services industry backgrounds (which comes in handy when you're launching a company) and are longtime entrepreneurs and friends.  That's us--from left to right, Allen, Brock and Dave from MountnGo. But we can't create an amazing, awesome backpack from the office or hanging out on the beach, so Strat and Kyle are out there crushing it, figuring out exactly what we need. Together, we believe we've created a backpack you'll ABSOLUTELY LOVE!

We take this step with confidence in our products and wholehearted gratitude for all those in our corner, cheering us on. </p>

</div></div>","The world’s most comfortable, versatile, and durable pair of waterproof, leather gloves.
The 4-Season Glove is designed to endure all of life’s challenges and enable seamless transition between work, play, and everything in between.







 
Useful Ordering Information!

How do you choose your size?

We will send you a follow up survey in May asking for your sizes.
Do the 4-Season Gloves come with Wax Coating and Initial Branding?

After you order the 4-Season Gloves, we will send an email to you with options to upgrade your gloves with Wax Coating and Initial Branding.
















Life is awesome, but we have a tendency to restrict ourselves and fall into monotony. Give’r provides a tangible reminder to ourselves and those around us to seize opportunities in the everyday and to give life our all. Give'r promotes a lifestyle fueled by passion, purpose, challenge and adventure.





We aim to inspire the unrelenting pursuit of dreams, the confidence to take the road less traveled, and the desire to share the wonders of life with others.





We promote these beliefs by designing and creating straightforward, fun, comfortable apparel and accessories, made for the Give’r that lives within us all.





 Choosing to Give’r doesn’t solely pertain to outdoor adventures, it’s about giving it your all in everything you do. If you’re trying a completely new hobby, starting a company, or even moving halfway across the world to discover new experiences, the 4-Season Gloves are here to put adventure back in your hands.





These gloves are designed and built to get the job done so you can Give’r however you choose! Whether you’re a man or woman, parent or child, student or teacher, professional or amateur, these gloves were designed for YOU!  Get out there and live it up!




















Designed for your day-to-day adventures, the 4-Season Gloves are perfect for travelers, adventurers, athletes, and everyone in-between. They’re  more than just great-looking comfortable gloves, they’re a daily reminder to seize opportunities in the everyday and live your life to the fullest.















The new 4-Season Gloves’ leather exterior provides superior dexterity, durability, and insulation for your hands. The gloves are waterproof and designed to handle colder temperatures and intense winter weather, while at the same time tough enough to literally hold a burning log. 















The 4-Season Gloves keep you warm and comfortable whether you’re gardening, skiing, chopping wood, climbing a mountain, or even dog-sledding. They make the cut for essential everyday gear that looks good, feels good and gets the job done.
Use the 4-Season Gloves for any cold-weather sport, work, or recreational activities. These gloves are as multifunctional as you are.





































                                 

Sizing (you will choose once the campaign is over):
















If you have longer fingers and are on the line between sizes then go with the larger size of the two. If you are in between sizes on the chart, and like a tighter fit, then go with the smaller size; if you like a roomier relaxed fit, then go with the larger size. 
Comparison to sizing on Classic Give’r Gloves: The 4-Season Gloves are designed to be more form fitting when compared to the Classic Give’r Gloves.  While most customers wear the same size in both styles, if you are between sizes, or find your Classic Gloves to fit snugly, we recommend you select the larger size of options.
Initial Branding: 





 
 Each glove is as unique as their owner, and we take great pride in the workmanship and attention to detail needed to make a pair of glove truly YOURS. Limit of three letters if you choose to have your gloves branded, branded on both the left and right hand.





Wax “Bomb-Proof” Coating:





We will hand-treat and bake your gloves with bee’s wax, saturating the all-leather shell, resulting in a look that is as tough as the gloves themselves.










We set out to design a timeless and stylish pair of gloves that is utilitarian through and through. Any day, any situation...this one glove does it all.





  Durable Shell





The outermost layer features top grade cow leather that is tanned and treated to be waterproof.  While cheaper alternatives exist, this leather was selected because it is the toughest available/on the market, yet soft and quick to break in.  Leather shell has been reinforced for wear and tear on palms and fingertips.





 Hipora Membrane





The second layer of the 4-Season Glove features a membrane that is wind-proof and waterproof, protecting your hands and keeping them warm and dry.  This membrane features tiny microscopic perforations that enables water vapor to escape, keeping your hands ready for action.





Thinsulate Insulation





The third and innermost layer utilizes material that is breathable and moisture-resistant to keep you warm and comfortable. Thinsulate insulation works by trapping heated air molecules between you and the outside thereby keeping your hands warm and isolated from the cold. 





Leather Skirt





Leather skirt keeps snow, moisture and other material out of the gloves when putting them on and while wearing them. The inner cuff of skirt provides the perfect canvas for the Give’r Crew to hand brand your initials.





Leather Strap On Cuff






Pull straps make it easy and non-damaging to put on or remove your gloves as quickly as as you like.





Elastic Cuff





The compact design of the elastic cuff provides a snug fit, yet flexible fit around your wrist. Keeps heat in and and everything else out while remaining comfortable enough to wear all day.

Wenn Ihr also den ein oder anderen Euro übrig habt, dann ermöglicht Euren Lieblingsrollerderby-Spielerinnen die Reise über den großen Teich.
Um den besten Spielerinnen von BCRD die Reise zu ermöglichen, veranstalten wir Bootcamps und verschiedene Fundraising-Aktionen. Das gesammelte Geld wird allein in Flüge, Hotel- sowie Mietwagen-Kosten investiert. (Alle Kosten, die nicht durch Spenden gedeckelt werden können, müssen leider privat von den Spielerinnen, dem Coach und der Bench getragen werden.)

Mit Eurer Teilnahme an unserer Indiegogo-Kampagne könnt Ihr nicht nur unsagbar viele Punkte fürs persönliche Karma-Konto sammeln, sondern auch coole Sachen ergattern. Ihr wollt wissen, was für coole Sachen das sind? Dann schaut kurz mal auf die rechte Bildschirmseite. Vorab geht ein ganz besonderer Dank für die Unterstützung an unseren Sportverein, dem Lurich 02 e.V. und an unsere Sponsoren:  Quad Roller Skate Shop ++ Facciola ++ Cooper's CiderSpread the word! ...und seid dabei!!!#bearhaha #honeybear #bcrd++ English version here ist is ++
Guess who’s back, back again, Bear City’s back, tell a friend!!



It’s that time again - the 2016 season is starting and we are headed to America to secure our
spot as one of the top D2 teams in the world! Our first stop is deep in the heart of the country at
the Midwest BrewHaHa tournament in Milwaukee (June 3-5). But, we need your help to get there!




You helped us last year to get to Detroit and we won 6th place. We want more, though. We are
going for gold and ready to win - for you (our fans), for us and for Europe! We want to show the
derby world that Europe's got serious talent and we are determined to win.
So, can you spare a few Euros to allow your favorite Bombshells to spread their wings and fly
across the Atlantic to America?
With your participation in this Indiegogo campaign you won’t only gather precious points
for your karma account, but we have some nice perks to throw at you as well! Peep them
on the side!
We thank our beloved home club and sponsors who brought us so far!
SC Lurich 02 e.V. ++ Quad Roller Skate Shop ++ Facciola ++ Cooper's Cider

We are three avid cyclists Mike Villeseche. (left) Michael Knight (middle) Kel Kiez (right) who love to ride bikes, we enjoy being in the great outdoors and going for long bike rides. We love participating in Winnipeg cycle events like the Muddy Waters Habitat for humanity Bike Ride which is put on by and helps raise money for Habitat for Humanity. Mike Villeseche is a Photographer, Michael Knight is a Graphic Artist, Kel Kiez is a Drafts man. We started thinking about how cool it would be to have a small light weight mini camper that would be big enough for one person to sleep in that could be towed by a bicycle anywhere! And so began the beginnings of our idea and dream.
We spent many long hours coming up with a design inspired by many home made campers that we had researched on the Internet, thinking about new Eco friendly light weight materials as most of the home made campers were made of heavy wood and steel construction and seemed very impractical for any kind of an extended bike trip. Our immediate goal was to design something simple, elegant, practical and light weight so as a cyclist could take our mini camper anywhere they felt comfortable.
We took our design to the Winnipeg Cyclovia street festival event which is a great place for cyclist and bike enthusiasts of all walks of life attend. The people we showed our design too absolutely loved it and we got asked many times where they could buy one! So just based on that and the many other people we have showed our design to we feel there is a strong market for such a product.
If we can get financial backing to help us take our design to the next level which is to have a prototype constructed we can then take our mini bike camper out to local events such as the MEC Bike Fest usually held at the Winnipeg Forks Market, The September Cyclovia street festival and many, other bike events, auto shows, green technology events, trade shows and show off our camper prototype. We just know that people will see this little camper around town and immediately fall in love with it just as we have. We feel very strongly that from that point our little mini camper will practically sell itself.

What We Need & What You Get

We need funding to help us have a prototype of our mini bike camper constructed. Our goal is to have one ready for spring of 2013. We definitely would like it ready to show off for the MEC's Bike Fest.
We need marketing materials printed up to hand out at special events and trade shows.

We offer our contributors outstanding perks for helping us out.

Higher contributors will have their company logos and web addresses featured prominently at special events for a full year with an option to renew for only $500. At special events we will have our mini camper on public display along with a large colorfull display featuring company logos and web addresses so people can see who has provided funding to help our project achieve it's goal.
Company web addresses and names will also be featured on our blog and website.
We are also providing tee shirts, mugs, postcards and posters that feature our mini camper design to help show our appreciation for contributors at various levels.
With what most companies spend on just a simple ad in a newspaper that runs for just a week the benefits of our perks become obvious.

In the event that we do not reach our goal you still get all the perks we promised. The funds will be saved and added to whatever other monies we manage to raise outside of this campaign. No matter what we have great faith in this idea and product and we WILL Make It Work!


The Impact
What could be more Eco friendly than a solar powered light weight mini bike camper that can not only be towed by a bicycle? Now imagine it being towed by one of those mini ""Smart Cars,"" a Moped or any other small Eco friendly vehicle.

Cyclists will be able to camp in comfort and style with this easy to tow mini camper.

Contributors will have their names and companies associated with a new and innovative Eco friendly green technology product.
With the worlds focus becoming more and more environmentally conscious the benefits become obvious.

<h3>The Back Story: Arrowhead Ranch</h3>
<p>Arrowhead Ranch &amp; Retreat in Parksville, New York, in Sullivan County, is close to the site of the 1969 Woodstock Music &amp; Arts Festival.  The site has stories dating back to the old days of the Catskills. This region was famous back in the 50s, 60s, and 70s as the ""Borscht Belt"", the resort playground of the NY metropolitan area.</p>
<p>The legendary <i>Arrowhead Dude Ranch</i> was the birthplace of the jam band festival<i> </i>scene.  During its heyday in the early 1990s, artists including Phish, Widespread Panic, Blues Traveler, The Spin Doctors, Ziggy Marley, Ritchie Havens, The Band, The New Riders, and Hot Tuna, and many more graced it's indoor and outdoor stages. </p>
<p>After a dramatic fire, the property fell into disrepair and lay dormant for years.  We bought the property in 2017...we were not able to stand by and see it that way! </p>
<h3><strong>Arrowhead Today:</strong></h3>
<p>Today, Catskills tourism is back... in a BIG WAY!   The Arrowhead Ranch &amp; Retreat is perfectly poised to become a cultural resource for our community....We are creating jobs, providing entertainment, art, relaxation, and education.  We stand to become another great option to enjoy within a reasonably short drive for our guests from New York City and surrounding areas.  </p>
<p>The idyllic, untouched 70 acre setting is a place where magic still happens.  The layout, with its meadows, rolling hills, and lake is simply perfect!  We have already done a lot of work to restore and beautify the property!  With a whole lot of love and faith, work and money, we are bringing it back to its former glory... and beyond. We've hosted 7 weekend music events in the past 2 summers and have created a great buzz of enthusiasm!  </p>
<p>Our long term goals include residencies for artists and musicians, a health spa, restaurant/bar, an indoor event center for concerts, weddings, and private parties, and retirement community opportunities. </p>
<p>Also, and certainly not the least of our goals, is we intend to make Arrowhead Ranch &amp; Retreat  a shining example of sustainable living and technology.</p>
<h3><strong>This Campaign: </strong></h3>
<p>...will fund the costs of <i>site engineering, design, and legal representation</i> needed for approvals... allowing us to open full-time, and bring the business into a positive cash flow, by the end of <i>this summer</i>! Phase 1 is to become a licensed campground with amenities, and 12 extended-stay hotel rooms.   Your generous contribution will enable us to complete the planning stages and achieve our Phase 1 goals. </p>
<p>Our goal for this campaign is to raise $70,000 . We will welcome contributions at any level.  For larger funding, please contact us regarding <i>Private Notes</i>, and a limited number of <i>Partnerships</i>.   </p>

<p><strong>Constructed of premium American materials</strong>, the Delta Shovel comes in two impressive forms -<strong> 6061 Aircraft Grade Aluminum</strong> and <strong>12 Gauge Cold Rolled Steel - </strong>both proudly American made in our Oregon factory.</p>

<p>The Delta is the result of two years of research and development. It exists because for us, and those we serve, there was a gap in our quiver. </p>
<p>So, we set to work with our collective: offroad instructors, wildland firefighters, professional drivers and explorers, park trail builders, and more.</p>
<p>We iterated our designs and put the Delta to the test. We even made 100 pre-production prototypes and, when our collective gave feedback, we incorporated the feedback into the Delta and made it better.</p>
<p>This Delta is the result of our co-creative process and is our seventh shovel and dare we say our ""seventh son.""</p>

<p>The Delta Shovel operates in the area between E-Tools and full-sized contractor shovels. It’s got all their strengths, and none of their weakness - it’s a full-sized shovel you can take with you anywhere. It’s an E-tool that doesn’t suck to use. It’s the Goldilocks Shovel. Whatever you want to call it, it’s got some serious advantages over other tools.</p>
<p><strong>Strength:</strong> The Delta boasts the best strength-to-weight ratio of any full-sized shovel. Masterful engineering and premium materials bring out the best in the Delta’s compact, ridiculously tough design.</p>
<p><strong>Versatility:</strong> Bringing one shovel is a challenge as it is. Bringing one that can work as a shovel or a hoe at three different shaft lengths gives you six options for optimal digging and leverage, whether you’re digging out a stuck truck or planting trees.</p>
<p><strong>Quality:</strong> The market is flooded with cheap shovels and E-tools, most of them of dubious quality and specifications. The Delta, on the other hand, is the result of American engineering, ultra-premium materials, and meticulous attention to detail. Once you feel it in your hand, you’ll know.</p>
<p><strong>Portability:</strong> Compactability, portability, packability, rackability… Whatever you want to call it, the Delta’s got ability to spare, and it’ll go with you anywhere thanks to the compact design and a mount that’ll keep it rattle-free wherever you roam. Because the best shovel on earth won’t help you if you leave it in your garage. </p>
<p>We’ve been making shovels for four years. In that time, we have had an exceptional quality track record. On top of that, under any human-powered load, not one of our shafts have ever failed. The Delta is no exception.The shovel is tested to<strong> lift over 1000 lbs</strong>, so it won’t bend - even under the toughest situations. The <strong>superior materials</strong> combined with our<strong> innovative engineering </strong>make sure the Delta Shovel <strong>will never fail you.</strong></p>

A compact, portable feat of engineering from DMOS, the makers of the Alpha Shovel, the most crowdfunded shovel ever on Kickstarter, and the award-winning Stealth Shovel. State of the art engineering and American manufacturing combine to create a full-sized shovel that's durable, versatile and unstoppable. 
 



Constructed of premium American materials, the Delta Shovel comes in two impressive forms - 6061 Aircraft Grade Aluminum and 12 Gauge Cold Rolled Steel - both proudly American made in our Oregon factory.

The Delta is the result of two years of research and development. It exists because for us, and those we serve, there was a gap in our quiver. 
So, we set to work with our collective: offroad instructors, wildland firefighters, professional drivers and explorers, park trail builders, and more.
We iterated our designs and put the Delta to the test. We even made 100 pre-production prototypes and, when our collective gave feedback, we incorporated the feedback into the Delta and made it better.
This Delta is the result of our co-creative process and is our seventh shovel and dare we say our ""seventh son.""

The Delta Shovel operates in the area between E-Tools and full-sized contractor shovels. It’s got all their strengths, and none of their weakness - it’s a full-sized shovel you can take with you anywhere. It’s an E-tool that doesn’t suck to use. It’s the Goldilocks Shovel. Whatever you want to call it, it’s got some serious advantages over other tools.
Strength: The Delta boasts the best strength-to-weight ratio of any full-sized shovel. Masterful engineering and premium materials bring out the best in the Delta’s compact, ridiculously tough design.
Versatility: Bringing one shovel is a challenge as it is. Bringing one that can work as a shovel or a hoe at three different shaft lengths gives you six options for optimal digging and leverage, whether you’re digging out a stuck truck or planting trees.
Quality: The market is flooded with cheap shovels and E-tools, most of them of dubious quality and specifications. The Delta, on the other hand, is the result of American engineering, ultra-premium materials, and meticulous attention to detail. Once you feel it in your hand, you’ll know.
Portability: Compactability, portability, packability, rackability… Whatever you want to call it, the Delta’s got ability to spare, and it’ll go with you anywhere thanks to the compact design and a mount that’ll keep it rattle-free wherever you roam. Because the best shovel on earth won’t help you if you leave it in your garage. 
We’ve been making shovels for four years. In that time, we have had an exceptional quality track record. On top of that, under any human-powered load, not one of our shafts have ever failed. The Delta is no exception.The shovel is tested to lift over 1000 lbs, so it won’t bend - even under the toughest situations. The superior materials combined with our innovative engineering make sure the Delta Shovel will never fail you.

With the foldable 3-position head, the Delta can be used as a shovel, a hoe, or fold it up for compact stowing. The collapsible shaft also lets you use the Delta at 3 different lengths. Combined together, you get a powerfully versatile tool that’s perfect for every situation.



The Delta Shovel integrates seamlessly with other DMOS products. Change heads and shafts as needed to fit your specific situation and preferences. (After the campaign, you will be offered options to add DMOS-compatible shovel blades and mounts to build your quiver.)

DMOS Collective shovels have impressed the testers at the best gear review sites across the outdoor industry.

 In addition, DMOS has partnered with:


Stuck in rough spot? Don’t worry - the Delta Shovel’s got your back.

We tested the Delta Shovel through everything we could think of - sand dunes, muddy riverbeds, and tough gravel. We’ve had fire departments use this shovel for salvages, and we’ve recovered vehicles. No matter the terrain, the Delta Shovel will carry you through.


The Delta shovel is a tool worthy of its place on even the most discerning 4x4, adventure van or RV. But the best tool in the world won’t make a difference if you leave it at home, so we built a dedicated vehicle mount for the Delta. 
The DMOS Delta Mount is built to DMOS’s tough and light design specs to keep your Delta securely stowed when you’re not busting dirt with it. There are two options:



 

 

Choose between two superior USA-sourced materials for your Delta Shovel’s construction. Each are ultra-strong and guaranteed against manufacturer’s defects for life.



Want strength without the weight? The 6061 Aircraft Grade Anodized Aluminum Delta Shovel is the one for you.

Ultra-light and ultra-strong, 6061 Aluminum. So unless you’re applying more pressure than a thousand pounds of cargo, mach 3 winds, or a sonic boom - your Delta Shovel will be fine.

In addition, the aluminum shaft is anodized to prevent rust, scratches, and corrosion. The blades are powder coated for a durable, yet environmentally-friendly finish.

For increased power and strength, you can choose our classic 12 Gauge Cold Rolled Steel shovel.

We cold form our steel - it’s a complex process but makes our steel 20 percent stronger than typical hot-rolled steel. So go ahead - do your worst. The heavy-duty, USA-sourced, 12-gauge steel will stand up to every crunch, slam and scoop you put your Delta Shovel through. 




Our shaft is indexed into three interlocking parts that allows it to be fully collapsible without compromising strength or integrity. Our engineers specifically designed the shaft and its components to bear the full force of a truck leveraged against it.

 
Plus, because of its lightweight and extendable design, you’ll get full leverage and strength of a full-sized shovel without the back-breaking weight or bulk of one. 
Compact your Delta down from a full-size shovel to the length of your forearm. Stow away your shovel anywhere you want or use our mount to have it securely stowed and readily available without taking any extra space.

The Delta’s 12 Gauge Steel Connector is an engineering marvel and is hands down the most powerful and versatile shovel bracket EVER MADE.



12 oversized flush rivets securely embed the bracket to your shovel head - there’s no separating these two. An easy-access T-Handle allows the Delta Shovel to fold up halfway, into a hoe, or fully for packability.

We squared off and sealed the connection to fit perfectly around the DMOS shaft - so no dust, dirt, or mud gets in. The bracket girdles the shaft - making the Delta Shovel much stronger and capable of lifting incredible weight, all while staying completely collapsible.

No doubt - this is the strongest shovel bracket you’ll ever find.


The nylon is ultra-strong as well as lightweight. Keep a good handle on your shovel in every situation. 

Our shovels are manufactured in Oregon by the best manufacturers of high-strength, high-durability, and high-engineered products in the world. These guys make a living making the most badass, strongest, and nearly indestructible products, tools, and components on the planet. 
 
 
Now, they’re making you the Ultimate Shovel and Survival Tool Ever - with absolutely zero compromise.


Quality and community matters - that’s why DMOS sources, designs, and manufactures everything in the USA. From the metal we use, to the engineers, to the manufacturers and assemblers, every part and aspect of the DMOS Delta Shovel is 100% American.

We’re making shovels the only way we know how - made in the USA.

We’re absolutely sure this is the best outdoor and survival tool you’ll ever use. As such, we guarantee your shovel will be free of any manufacturing defects. Period.  


Note, this doesn’t apply to finish wear. If your gear isn’t salty, scuffed, and grimy, you’re not running it hard enough. Your Delta should wear scars with pride. 

DMOS is known for making the world’s best shovels out of premium materials and designing them to tackle the toughest adventures.
We’re a crowdfunded company, created by the people for the people. This is our third Kickstarter campaign, and our seventh shovel. Our last campaign was the most funded shovel in Kickstarter history. 
From smokejumpers to backcountry enthusiasts, we’re the go-to choice for anyone who needs fail-proof gear they can trust. The reviews speak for themselves. We have over 300 5-star reviews from all over the world.

As with all our products, the Delta Shovel has been an ongoing collaboration between, overlanders, elite military personnel, pro athletes, first-responders, outdoor enthusiasts, engineers, designers, and users alike.

<li>The Grill Gun can potentially burn anything up to 5 feet from its fire bell (flame end) when it is lit and fully operating.  Always be responsible to allow plenty of space around you and the GrillGun when using it. </li>
<li>Always use the GrillGun outdoors in a well-ventilated area.</li>
<li>The fire bell will get very hot within moments of use.   Allow plenty of time for the fire bell to cool down before touching it or laying it down on a melt-able or flammable surface.  The GrillGun is sold with a stand and a hanging ring so it can either be stood up or hung in an upright position to cool.</li>
<li>If children are present when the GrillGun is cooling after use, disconnect the propane and hang the GrillGun out of reach to prevent accidental burns or mishandling by the curious.</li>
<li>Always teach someone how to properly operate the GillGun before allowing them to handle it.  Only allow someone to use it, if they respect its power and will operate it safely.</li>
<li>As with any powerful tool, keep the GrillGun and its propane bottles safely stored out of reach of children and other untrained, unwise people.</li>
<li>When the GrillGun is not in use, it is always safest to separate the GrillGun from the propane. </li>
<li>The GrillGun is a very powerful tool that, when used correctly, will make your charcoal grilling and other fire-starting needs fun, simple, and safe.</li>

 The GrillGun is a very powerful torch.  For safe operation, follow these simple rules:
The Grill Gun can potentially burn anything up to 5 feet from its fire bell (flame end) when it is lit and fully operating.  Always be responsible to allow plenty of space around you and the GrillGun when using it. 
Always use the GrillGun outdoors in a well-ventilated area.
The fire bell will get very hot within moments of use.   Allow plenty of time for the fire bell to cool down before touching it or laying it down on a melt-able or flammable surface.  The GrillGun is sold with a stand and a hanging ring so it can either be stood up or hung in an upright position to cool.
If children are present when the GrillGun is cooling after use, disconnect the propane and hang the GrillGun out of reach to prevent accidental burns or mishandling by the curious.
Always teach someone how to properly operate the GillGun before allowing them to handle it.  Only allow someone to use it, if they respect its power and will operate it safely.
As with any powerful tool, keep the GrillGun and its propane bottles safely stored out of reach of children and other untrained, unwise people.
When the GrillGun is not in use, it is always safest to separate the GrillGun from the propane. 
The GrillGun is a very powerful tool that, when used correctly, will make your charcoal grilling and other fire-starting needs fun, simple, and safe.
 
 For my whole life, I've been an entrepreneur bottled up as a businessman and an engineer, working for other successful companies and start-ups.  Now I'm taking my years of practical experience and applying everything I've learned to this new venture.My career has been focused on bringing high quality products to market.  From fish-finders to wind turbines and solar panels, from Non-Profits startups to cattle ranching, my range of product development experience and business development is far reaching.  I have successfully coordinated new product development all over the world - across the US, China, India, Australia, and the UK. Now it's time to build a really fun business that serves an under-served and very-deserving population: the Charcoal Griller!  Our manufacturing companies need a minimum financial commitment from us to get started on a large manufacturing run. Manufacturing and administrative costs for starting a company capable of producing and delivering products like the GrillGun require an enormous amount of capital. Traditional investment firms, Venture Capitalists and Angel Investors have no frame of reference for funding a project like this since are no similar products out there.The crowdfunding platform offers many backers, ""risk free"", the ability to support new and innovative ideas like this one.  As long as we entrepreneurs are  honest with you, then you have no risk, and I am honest through and through.  We had to start somewhere and Kickstarter seemed like a perfect match.  Now after a very successful campaign, we've moved on to Indiegogo Indemand to allow interested backers a place to go while we are getting our retail e-commerce site up and running. Please back us and spread the word._______________________________________________________________________________________ GrillBlazer is a company focused on giving you top quality outdoor grilling accessories, the GrillGun and the Su-VGun being the first of many to come.  Our company is dedicated to giving you the best and most well-designed products possible.  Beyond justs making cool products, our company is dedicated to fostering healthy human interactions that build community.Over the past 12 months we studied the market, human interaction, and the competition, in order to rise to the level of excellence, that you would expect from a company that intends make 40 million charcoal grillers happy over the next several years.You can tell we did our homework right if you watch the reviews on this site, as well as many more at GrillBlazer.com.  The amount of product research and market research that we did will pay dividends in the future for both our backers and for us. Our manufacturing companies are is ready to go. All we need is your support.  So how soon can we deliver the ""Ultimate Grill Torch... The GrillGun"" to you or to someone(s) in your life? We really do know exactly what we are doing and to help you know what our current expectations are.  Below, you will see a Production Schedule that all signs seem good to go!",30.0,15,"1 Campaign

<h2>Introduce PowerElf</h2>
<p>Designing an outdoor power supply is challenging to ensure safe and sufficient power for hungry outdoor equipment. Our 1st generation product PS300 power station (462W/124,865mAh, multiple outputs ports including 2 AC output ports, raised over 10,000,000 Yen in Makuake, Japan) is one of the most powerful and safest power supplies.  However, for some outdoor activities, like backpacking and hiking, a lightweight power supply would be more useful. To fill this need, iforway designed the PowerElf, which is a lighter version of the PS300.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1530072751/wxg9quvwlyssrzi3wwow.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>The PowerElf is compact (1.2kg/2.65lb) – one-sixth the volume of the PS300 power stations) and IP64 waterproof shell, making PowerElf more suitable for tough outdoor activities. PowerElf includes the important features from the PS300: multiple power output ports (45W Type-C, USB, DC output, and 12V cigarette ports), 3 ways of charging (wall outlets, solar panels, and 12V cigarette plugs), and most importantly, 10 layers of power protection.</p>

<p>Solar panels are useful for recharging outdoors but can be very inefficient. PowerElf employees MPPT (Maximum Power Point Tracking) solar charging controller, which delivers maximum power to loads to the batteries. This solar charging efficiency results in 10% higher than other batteries to save you recharging time *.</p>
<p><i>*: Due to the shipping policy and customs duty requirement, please note that solar panel <strong>is not included</strong> with this product. We recommend you buy solar panels directly from your local store or Amazon. Any 60W solar panel with a DC5521 port  and a 14-25V output voltage works with PowerElf.</i></p>
<h3>Car Charging</h3>
<p>PowerElf can be charged via 12V vehicle cigarette plug, which is a substitute for solar power in poor weather.</p>

Introduce PowerElf
Designing an outdoor power supply is challenging to ensure safe and sufficient power for hungry outdoor equipment. Our 1st generation product PS300 power station (462W/124,865mAh, multiple outputs ports including 2 AC output ports, raised over 10,000,000 Yen in Makuake, Japan) is one of the most powerful and safest power supplies.  However, for some outdoor activities, like backpacking and hiking, a lightweight power supply would be more useful. To fill this need, iforway designed the PowerElf, which is a lighter version of the PS300.

The PowerElf is compact (1.2kg/2.65lb) – one-sixth the volume of the PS300 power stations) and IP64 waterproof shell, making PowerElf more suitable for tough outdoor activities. PowerElf includes the important features from the PS300: multiple power output ports (45W Type-C, USB, DC output, and 12V cigarette ports), 3 ways of charging (wall outlets, solar panels, and 12V cigarette plugs), and most importantly, 10 layers of power protection.

Product Highlights
Even when you are in the middle of nowhere, you can still recharge this mini power station by solar panels or cars.  This mini power station is also integrated with an LED flashlight when you need extra light.  Take PowerElf mini power station with you on your next adventure! Enjoy your trip without worrying about a power crisis!

 

 

 

When Do You Need PowerElf?

The PowerElf will charge your electronic devices anytime, anywhere.  Use it for outdoor activities, such as camping, backpacking, fishing and partying. Or, keep the PowerElf nearby in case of a blackout emergency.
Charge Free From the Wall Outlets
With PowerElf, you can charge your devices without using wall sockets. This is especially useful for CPAP (Continuous Positive Airway Pressure) users!

What Can You Do with PowerElf?


 
Faster Solar Power Recharge

Solar panels are useful for recharging outdoors but can be very inefficient. PowerElf employees MPPT (Maximum Power Point Tracking) solar charging controller, which delivers maximum power to loads to the batteries. This solar charging efficiency results in 10% higher than other batteries to save you recharging time *.
*: Due to the shipping policy and customs duty requirement, please note that solar panel is not included with this product. We recommend you buy solar panels directly from your local store or Amazon. Any 60W solar panel with a DC5521 port  and a 14-25V output voltage works with PowerElf.
Car Charging
PowerElf can be charged via 12V vehicle cigarette plug, which is a substitute for solar power in poor weather.


 
Waterproof and Shockproof Shell
Waterproof, shockproof, and dustproof, the IP64 shell provides maximum protection from harsh environments. Water sprayed from any angle will not damage PowerElf's internal battery.

 
High Intensity LED Light 


In case of emergency, the integrated LED flashlight is ready for you to send out an SOS signal. 
 
The Safest Outdoor Power Solution
We care about your devices as much as you do, so we have designed multiple layers of protection in the PowerElf:

Maximum Battery Capacity
Improved battery efficiency, reducing wasted capacity from the thermal and self-consumption loss:
•     Improved Battery Management System to reduce overcharging risk
•    Thermal consumption decreased via DC synchronous rectification
•    MPPT solar charging controller efficiency increased by 10%
•    Reduced self-consumption current to less than 10uA allowing the PowerElf to hold more than 90% charge after a year
•    Auto sleep function.

Everything is set but we need a bit of financing for Localdoo project to take off. Please take a minute to read more what is it all about.</p><p><strong>THE PROBLEM</strong><br/>Wherever you traveled around the world you must have experienced difficulty to connect directly with local people and establishments not being mentioned in one of the mainstream travel guides, hoping your tourism dollars will help the local economy and people, not big tour operator and large corporations.<br/>Local people often have a valuable product, skill, or knowledge base to offer - and are looking for opportunity - but lack ways of marketing themselves to travelers online or those traveling through the region.</p><p><br/><strong>LOCALDOO</strong><strong> IS THE WAY TO CHANGE THAT</strong><br/>In order to connect local farmers, producers and sellers with travelers visiting the least developed parts of Croatia we are developing Localdoo. Least developed part of Croatia, was heavily affected by the war for country's independence during the 90's is the region with one of the most beautiful wonders of nature, Plitvice lakes national park. Although this national park is being visited by thousands of people daily during the season local people, their crafts, products and heritage are being avoided and neglected for decades due to poor government politics, absence of interest by the tourist board and the tour operators and the lack of sustainable development projects. All those factors forced younger generations to emigrate from the region with the ambition to find a better life and perspective somewhere else in Croatia or around the world. Today mostly elder people inhabit the area and the total population decreased almost 4 times numbering only around 50 000 today.<br/>Our goal is to help locals create a network which would enable them to put their own small businesses on the map, offer their products, services, knowledge and experience and provide themselves with extra-income to lead an honorable and diligent life in dignity.</p><p> <br/><strong>LOCALDOO</strong><strong> HELPS LOCAL BUSINESSES FIND THEIR PLACE ON THE TOURISM MAP</strong><br/>According to the Croatian tourism board statistics around 1.4 mil travelers visit Plitvice lakes national park every year. The vast majority, who are on tours operated by large tour operators, leave the region the same day after the visit without being informed about local products, customs and many small businesses.<br/>Currently, many skilled micro-entrepreneurs are excluded from the tourism sector and are looking for opportunities to sustain and grow their small business. Two major obstacles to growth include 1) a lack of access to financing and working capital, and 2) insufficient access to markets. Localdoo addresses both.<br/>Some of the mentioned activities hoping to get marketed include beekeeping, honey production, honey inhalation therapy, local farming, animal husbandry, cheese making (and other dairy products), watermilling, therapy horse riding, fishing, production of herbal liquors, wood crafts and wooden cottage industry, etc.<br/>How does it work. All businesses, small entrepreneurs and farmers are displayed on the Localdoo platform. Travelers can easily browse through and choose the activities/locals/services they would like to visit/meet on their tour. Payments are made securely via PayPal and entrepreneurs receive direct confirmation/booking via email/sms. Localdoo presents true marked-based transaction between travelers and locals with valuable skills or products.</p><p><br/><strong>OUR REACH OUT TO HELP EFFECT CHANGE IN TOURISM</strong><br/>We hope to help to connect travelers with hundreds of off-the-grid entrepreneurs. Most of the local small businesses and farmers can double or tripple their monthly income with just two or three bookings per month, and by sharing what they are already doing as part of their livelihood strategy. Localdoo directly connects curious travelers with micro-entrepreneurs, and creates a positive impact promoting small and traditional crafts and businesses rather than main stream „fast food“ tourism products and services which can be found worldwide often hit by big tour operators and large groups.</p><p><br/><strong>THE SOCIAL IMPACT</strong><br/>Concerning the fact that this region in Croatia was heavily affected by war 22 years ago and it has lost ¾ of it's inhabitants, with practically all industries and farming devastated, it is not hard to imagine what kind of social impact could be made helping locals create a network and market for their products and services. Starting from the scratch most of small entrepreneurs and farmers did not get the same staring position like other regions in Croatia where the  tourism industry makes it close to 20% in national GDP.<br/>Localdoo platform has two major goals, to: 1) increase working capital at the entrepreneur level through bookings and 2) increase access to new markets for entrepreneurs and associated producer groups.<br/>To help increase the social impact, over 60% of entrepreneurs and farmers on the Localdoo platform will be female entrepreneurs. This way we can set a positive example not only to other women but also for young people to be able to secure the future with their skills, knowledge and tradition instead of looking for a better future in emigration.</p><p><br/><strong>OUR STORY</strong><br/>The idea to create a platform to link travelers with local producers and farmers came a cross to me, Localdoo founder, Marko Vlahov, after number of years working in the tourism industry, running a travel agency and being a tour guide. My professional background in tourism goes back for 15 years. I have been working with leading companies in the tourism industry as well as managing my own small travel business, developing day trips and multi day tours in Croatia and the region with special attention to sustainable development and support to local communities.<br/>For years I have been seeing locals often selling their goods and products next to the road or displaying hand made boards and directions advertising their services, most of the time their efforts were neglected or ignored by local administration and/or national tourist board. It made me think what could be done to help these people come to the surface and help them get their share of the market.<br/>I have received positive feedback from many guest and for a number of years, being asked how come local producers and entrepreneurs ar not supported more and displayed better for travelers who want to experience genuine Croatia and it's tradition and products.<br/>In order to get Localdoo fully off the ground, we need your support!</p><p><br/><strong>WHAT ARE WE HOPING FOR</strong><br/>We are hoping to collect $20,000in order to launch the Localdoo platform in Croatia.

LES BEEHIVE BOYS
Our team Les Beehive Boys is ecstatic to represent Salt Lake City and Utah in regional, national and now international bike polo events. Our team is composed of 3 players:Jimmy ""The Killer"" Araneda

""Not only did the republic of Chile rise up between the Andes Mountains and the Pacific Ocean but an emerging polo player was also rising up and coming to SLC. That player is Jimmy “The killer” Araneda. Jimmy quickly caught on to the game of polo having indepth knowledge of soccer, team play, bike handling and athletic prowess.

Our story started this year at the South West Qualifiers in Folsom, CA where Les Beehive Boys took 4th and qualified for the National. A long trip for the weekend but a first tournament together with great moves and intense games. Because Utah is far from most of the bike polo places where tournaments happen, we trained hard in Salt Lake and went straight to Lexington to compete at the continental level playing the North American Championship during 3 days. After we played 13 games we tied 13th over the 54 teams.We want to continue this beautiful adventure and represent our club, our state and our city during a world-class bike polo event.HARDCOURT IN FEW WORDSHardcourt Bike Polo is the modern version of grass bike polo.  2 teams of 3 players riding single speed bikes and playing into an enclosed rectangular area -such as a street hockey court - have to score with a little ball on the opposite goal using mallets.

The sport is played worldwide in most middle to big cities. Europe and U.S. are mostly leading the major tournaments but south america, asia and pacific are also showing that this urban sport is growing.

It is a combination between collective sport, individual bike and ball handling skills with a big place for FUN too!

FLIGHT 18 is a galactic
experience where audiences are cast as passengers on a journey through outer
space.  Passengers revel inside a
360Â° video installation of the Universe through which our Spaceship
Kaleidoscope sails with an all-star cast of performing artists and disc jockeys.   The only rule on-board is to 'feel free'.

Each cosmic joyride is accompanied by a spectacle of poems, songs, dances and spontaneous outbursts.  Pilots instantly intersperse images and text generated live while mixing voices, videos, sounds and light in real time.  

FLIGHT 18  flew thirty trips in
2010 with a grant from Lower Manhattan Cultural Council to great critical and popular success.  Now with support from chashama and
3-Legged Dog Art & Technology Center, FLIGHT
18 will rise again bringing people into the great beyond.

Flight Schedule:  
 September 27, 2012 - December 2, 2012, 6 flights per week
3-Legged
Dog Art & Technology Center in Lower
Manhattan   
Tickets range from $18 to $72 depending on time of purchase.  


Loving
with reckless abandon is the best act of revolution
Because we are less different than we are the same
Because there is no game to win
It is just this interconnectedness that blesses us.    
â€’ 
Rachel Kann
              





The Impact ...




We are here to bring together Earthlings in celebration of
the life we are living and the worlds to come.  Cyber-passengers
are also welcome to our general assembly of those who hold the future in their hands. 
FLIGHT
18 supports and
encourages the broadening global community who are aware, awake and alive.

 
We impact global peace and prosperity by being another
functioning model of the horizontal dispersal of power and the joy of cooperation.
 
We impact the space travel community as we discover humane
ways of escorting people through transcendent experience.
 
We impact the visual and performing arts by being a
spectacle that rewrites itself in the moment.  A whole new world of live art making is born where the
audience is the primary ingredient and a script is unnecessary.
 
We impact New York City as we bring a healing spirit to
Lower Manhattan calling for creative response to the world around us.





What We Need & What You Get ...



This Winter Fund Drive is set to raise at least $18,081 of
our $100,000 + budget.  We need at
least $18,081 by April 27 in order to begin the visual design of the
Universe.  Video animators and
computer programmers must begin their good work by April.  The rest of our budget (for
building supplies, uniforms, personnel, technology etc.) gets us to our
official launch on September 27.
 
What you get is the deep satisfaction of knowing you are
enabling the journey of the first ever Earth-bound spacecraft, harkening a free age of exploration.  Moreover, you will receive recognition,
free tickets, music and more.  
See perks.





Other Ways You Can Help ...




Friends who can't come to New York can still journey with us via Skype, 
so please tell everyone.

<p>Globalization is one of the main aspect in today's modern society. Therefore, to learn or master a new language is one of the most essential skill. But what if we didn't have the time to learn a new language and still want to travel? Or we have to make a business trip?

<p>The narrative of Tower of Babel explained that God was concerned that humans are disrespectful towards God by building the tower to escape the impossibility thoughts of living in God-creation world. Thus, God brought in the existence of different language to the world and scattered the people around the world so they were unable to understand one another. </p>
<p>However, for thousands of years until now, humans are still searching for a better way to communicate and understand each other.</p>
<p>As we can see, the world is filled with pain. If only language barrier isn't the problem, the world could perhaps not have any war.

<p>Before the 21st century, people solved this problem by studying each and every language. Interpreters that are experts in the languages are hired to translate. However, this is not effective enough for people since the World has all kinds of languages. Plus, humans have limited capabilities and limited time to learn every language spoken in the world.</p>

<p>As technology gets better in these recent years, Artificial Intelligence(AI) is introduced in the interpretation industry. AI now can outnumber human in many ways when it comes to languages.   </p>
<p>What makes us being determined to do this project was because a friend came on June 6th, 2015; and talked about traveling abroad. During their conversation, he commented that traveling abroad has become much more convenient because there are more international flights with a lower price, and traveling visa is easier to get.  </p>
<p>We were feeling very excited but then a question arose,  </p>
<p>""How did you communicate with foreigners when traveling abroad?""  </p>
<p>The conversation fell into a total silence.  </p>
<p>My friend admitted that he felt embarrassed and it wasn't so convenient when he was traveling abroad. Although he had a great time, there are also times because he wasn't able to communicate. He also joked that he had trouble approaching some ladies but gave up due to language problems.  </p>
<p>To cut the long story short, the conversation made us realize about the importance of language. Thus, the idea is approved by our friends. So we proceed to the development of the first generation of Mesay translation device. </p>

The Langogo got 100% accuracy.”“ If you were in a country where you spoke NOTHING of the language, the Langogo would be indispensable.”“The translation response time is incredibly fast for the work it’s doing- 10 years worth of language learning classes in one little device answering in real-time!”“We use Langogo in our own city as much as we use it during our travels. Living in Montreal, the official language is French, but our knowledge of the French language is limited.

 Here is what Gear Editor said when they tested the original Scrubba wash bag:Designed for those who travel light and free:Ultra-light hiking and camping:For ultra-light hikers and campers, there is nothing better than putting on a fresh pair of socks and underwear at the start of the day and the Scrubba wash bag MINI allow you to do this while only packing a couple of pairs.  By using the Scrubba wash bag MINI each night, you can have fresh socks and underwear to welcome each day's adventures.Multi-functional and lightweight:As any through-hiker would tell you, every gram (or ounce) counts.  However, the Scrubba wash bag MINI's job doesn't finish at washing your clothes.  Between washes, the Scrubba wash bag MINI multi-functions as a compression dry bag to keep gear dry, a wet bag or laundry bag until the next load, extra storage space that can be clipped onto your backpack, an iPhone protector (operable through the window) or a free-standing camp bucket for washing dishes, washing your face or shaving - all without polluting water-ways.Good for the environment:The Scrubba wash bag is an eco-friendly product.  It is designed to last for years and many hundreds of washes.  It is electricity-free, uses minimal water and allows grey water to be disposed of away from water-ways. Ultra-light holidaymakers and travellersFor holidaymakers and business travellers, there are times where you just need to wash a few items of clothing and it isn't enough to justify searching for a Laundromat or paying exorbitant hotel laundry fees.  Plus, do we really want to hand over our dirty socks and underwear to hotel staff?

<p>We used to travel a ton for work. Cross country red-eyes, business meetings, security lines, delays, etc, etc. Like most business travelers out there, we couldn't sleep on planes, yet refused to carry a travel pillow. They were simply too big to fit into our small carry-ons, not to mention they looked ridiculous. So like many, we preferred to suffer through our travels. </p>
<p>That's when it hit us, there had to be a better way. A device that not only was smaller and looked different, but a pillow that functioned unlike any other. Working with our medical design team, our product engineers developed a patented ergonomic design that functions by correctly supporting both the head and vertebrae, thus holding the neck in straighter alignment, for better comfort and superior rest.</p>
<p>Why the name BullRest? Well, bulls have the strongest necks in the animal kingdom. They also are a nice representation of our customer’s bullish attitude towards work and life. </p>

<p><b>How do I choose the color I want? </b>We will send out a survey in a few days following your pledge to ask for your color choice and shipping address.</p>

<p><b>Who can use a BullRest? </b>We conducted numerous ergonomic studies to ensure that the BullRest can meet the needs of most adults - both male and female. If a traditional travel pillow fits, so will the BullRest.</p>

If a traditional travel pillow works for you, so will the BullRest. Our engineers developed a world-first ergonomic shape that supports the upper vertebrae C1-C7 (critical for correct neck alignment). The BullRest is designed for both men and women.


The BullRest is not only small, but comfortable. Memory foam specifically molds to each user's neck (regardless of size) providing support and comfort where it's needed most.  
The BullRest has completed the manufacturing phase and is ready to ship. Below are images of the product coming off the production line. We worked with some of the world's best product engineers to ensure the quality lives up to our promise. 
(NOTE: The law tags featured are easily removed.)




 


We used to travel a ton for work. Cross country red-eyes, business meetings, security lines, delays, etc, etc. Like most business travelers out there, we couldn't sleep on planes, yet refused to carry a travel pillow. They were simply too big to fit into our small carry-ons, not to mention they looked ridiculous. So like many, we preferred to suffer through our travels. 
That's when it hit us, there had to be a better way. A device that not only was smaller and looked different, but a pillow that functioned unlike any other. Working with our medical design team, our product engineers developed a patented ergonomic design that functions by correctly supporting both the head and vertebrae, thus holding the neck in straighter alignment, for better comfort and superior rest.
Why the name BullRest? Well, bulls have the strongest necks in the animal kingdom. They also are a nice representation of our customer’s bullish attitude towards work and life. 


How do I choose the color I want? We will send out a survey in a few days following your pledge to ask for your color choice and shipping address.
How do I specify my shipping address? Same as above. We will ask for all your choices and juicy details in the survey we send out.

Who can use a BullRest? We conducted numerous ergonomic studies to ensure that the BullRest can meet the needs of most adults - both male and female. If a traditional travel pillow fits, so will the BullRest.
Does it come in different sizes? No. Not yet at least. We conducted extensive tests and analysis to ensure the BullRest is designed to fit approximately 80% of the adult population. 
What about kids?: Unfortunately, not yet. The BullRest is designed for adults. 
Can it be washed? Yes. Hand-wash only at this stage. We have selected 'high-wicking' fabrics that allows for easy cleaning and disinfecting with anti-bacterial wipes, or a wash cloth and minimal elbow grease.
When will I receive it? All product will be shipped in January 2017 on a rolling basis as more orders are placed. You can ensure that your order is processed in a timely manner by filling out your survey promptly upon receiving it from BackerKit (note: it takes approximately 11 days for us to send you the survey after you place your order per Indiegogo guidelines).

Here is the Medal:


The Revolver T-Shirts and Tank Tops Have been Shipped and will be arriving between a week or so (2 weeks for outside the USA). The Special Edition T-shirts are here and will be shipped today and you can always pick them up at the gym.Please be patient as Mexican Mail can be a little bit slow... Send any questions to hector@crossfitrevolver.com-------------Grab A T-Shirt And Help The Team Like Them:Who Are We? And How Can You Help Us Get To The CrossFit Games.Hi, Im Hector a co-owner and coach of CrossFit Revolver down here in Cancun, Mexico. We were lucky enough to put together a team of athletes that against all odds manage to qualify to the CrossFit Games Regionals as one of the top 5 teams in Latin America.Help Team CrossFit Revolver Represent our box, and our community:
This campaign is to raise funds so our team can travel to chile and compete at our first big CrossFit competition. 
We have a fighting chance but we need to get there first. That’s why we need YOU.
You can be a generous online supporter for our team and in return we will send you some really cool swag from CrossFit Revolver so you can brag to your buddies back at your box.
Every dollar that we get from your donations will go directly to financing our trip to regionals.
Every supporter will get free Drop Ins at our box on their next vacation to Cancun.
What Do We Need And Most Important...What Do You Get In Return For Your Generosity.Here are the details of our campaign:
Flights from Cancun to Chile are way more expensive than the team can afford. At more than $1000 bucks per ticket flying the team of 6 and myself will cost over $7000 USD. 
Accommodations for the 7 of us on the cheapest hotels that we could find are around $1500 usd for the whole week.
The trip will cost us about $8500 USD so that is the goal of our campaign.
What Do You Get :
We put together a package of a lot of really nice things that we know that any CrossFitter will enjoy and brag about.
