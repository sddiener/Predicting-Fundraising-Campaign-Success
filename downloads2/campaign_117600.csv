<p><a href=""http://paydayreport.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">PaydayReport.com</a> is very excited to announce that we have cut a print syndication deal with historic African American owned Chattanooga News Chronicle. Through this partnership, Payday’s reporting will be able to reach 30,000 print readers on a weekly basis in Chattanooga; providing workers in Eastern Tennessee with labor reporting that is sorely missing.</p>
<p>Now to reach even more readers, we need your help.  Our goal is to spend more time focused on reporting and less on fundraising. In coming months, Payday hopes to create more print partnerships with small newspapers and magazines as well as online publishers throughout the South.</p>
<p>We hope to raise $5,000 to help us meet our budget for the next 3 months.</p>
<p>Also, we encourage our readers to sign up to give $3 a month. Recurring monthly donations allow us to focus most of our energy on reporting instead of fundraising. Payday already <a href=""http://paydayreport.com/support-our-work/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">receives $1,018 a month</a> in recurring donations from 131 dues paying readers in addition to occasional grants and freelance fees.   (Sign up <a href=""http://paydayreport.com/support-our-work/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here</a> to contribute monthly)</p>
<p>Your contribution of twenty bucks today or what you can afford will be an excellent help us get out the story of workers organizing across the South.</p>
<p>The fastest-growing region in the United States for union membership is the South, where nearly 150,000 workers opted to join unions last year. As veterans of the digital media unionization, we know that if unionization in digital media has proved one thing, it is that coverage of workers unionizing leads to even more organizing. There is not a single full-time labor reporter covering the 60 million workers throughout the South.</p>
<p>Payday Report hopes to fill that void. Already, we have shown an ability to have a big impact on several stories in the South:</p>
<p>- Payday was <a href=""http://paydayreport.com/breaking-kentucky-expected-to-pass-right-to-work-this-week/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">the first publication </a>in the U.S. to break the story of Republicans Kentucky preparing to pass “Right-to-Work.”</p>
<p>- We were <a href=""http://paydayreport.com/obamas-last-second-west-texas-safety-reforms-could-be-scuttled-by-trump-administration/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">the only major outlet</a> to cover how delays by the Obama Administration could stop West, Texas safety reforms from taking effect</p>
<p>--  When six children were killed in a school bus crash in Chattanooga, Payday was <a href=""http://paydayreport.com/deadly-chattanooga-school-bus-company-has-long-history-of-worker-intimidation-safety-violations/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">the first outlet</a> to report on the school bus company’s long track record of worker intimidation and safety violations.</p>
<p>While the local media focused on placing blame on the school bus driver, Payday was able to shift the conversation to the role of privatized school bus companies cutting corners on safety and workers rights. The reporting lead to a State Senator <a href=""http://paydayreport.com/exclusive-tennessee-state-senator-calls-for-hearings-on-school-bus-privatization/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">calling for hearings</a> into privatized school busing</p>
<p>- -Payday Report was the first outlet to <a href=""http://paydayreport.com/as-mcconnell-stays-silent-mine-workers-warn-of-pension-catastrophe-this-winter/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">expose</a> how the political spending of Alliance Resources Partner CEO Joe Craft was leading to refusal of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to bring the MIner’s Relief Act. Eventually, our reporting was picked up by other outlets, contributing to the public pressure on McConnell to do something to protect the retirement of 125,000 retired miners and their beneficiaries.</p>
<p>--  For over three years, Payday Senior Labor Reporter Mike Elk has been <a href=""http://paydayreport.com/the-battle-for-chattanooga-southern-masculinity-the-anti-union-campaign-at-volkswagen/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">covering</a> attempts to unionize at Volkswsagen's factory in Chattanooga, Tennessee. This year, we exposed how Volkswagen had <a href=""http://paydayreport.com/exclusive-volkswagen-intimidated-workers-about-emission-whistleblowing/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">intimidated workers </a>against speaking up during the company’s emission scandal, which saw one of the biggest recalls in American history.</p>
<p>-- Finally, Payday Report's <a href=""http://paydayreport.com/category/payday-lunch-pail/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">weekly newsletter</a>, The Lunch Pail, has filled a vital hole in coverage by providing an overview of all the major victories and losses for organized labor throughout the South.</p>
<p>This coming winter, we hope to do a lot more. We hope to cover the “right-to-work” fight in Kentucky, the coming union election at Boeing in South Carolina, the growing movement of striking construction workers across the South as well continuing our coverage of the stubborn attempt unionizes at Volkswagen in Chattanooga.</p>
<p>To help us expand continue our coverage, we are asking our readers to contribute to our unique winter fund of $5,000. Also, please consider becoming a monthly recurring donor for as little as $3 a month (sign up <a href=""http://paydayreport.com/support-our-work/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here</a> to donate monthly).</p>
<p>So thanks for all of our help and happy holidays.</p>

<p>""L’Écrasée"", c'est un recueil de poésie ; mais c'est aussi une histoire disloquée, décousue, faite de petits bouts de vie étalés de 2005 à 2015.</p>
<p>L'histoire d'une femme Clara, et d'un homme, Kévin, qui sont en réalité une seule et même personne ; l'histoire de leur rencontre, de leur tentative de vivre ensemble dix ans durant, sans se toucher, sans respirer de peur de se gêner ; et finalement, l'histoire de leur abandon, l'un à l'autre, ou l'un sans l'autre.</p>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">""Mais la malédiction n'est l'effet que du coeur ; Nous n'avons pour destin que le bruit de nos âmes""... Il est toujours possible de changer les choses. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">C'est là que vous pouvez participer.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">Clara est transgenre. Elle a besoin de plusieurs milliers d'euros pour payer ses frais médicaux. Ils ne sont pas nécessaires pour survivre, mais ils le sont pour vivre - ce n'est pas toujours le plus facile. Clara n'a rien à vous offrir en échange, que ce qu'elle a fait toute sa vie, sans raison, parfois contre sa volonté : de la poésie. De la poésie bancale, ça ne vaut pas grand chose ; mais il y a eu des jours où la vie de Clara ne tenait qu'à un poème bancal.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">En offrant à Clara les moyens de vivre, elle vous offrira des poèmes. Des poèmes bancals, mais qui vous toucheront peut-être. </span></p>

</div><div>
<p>Selon la somme que vous accepterez de verser, vous recevrez des compensations variables sous forme poétique. </p>
<ul><li>""La Belle &amp; La Bête"" est un très long poème (plus de 200 vers) sous forme de conte qui traite directement de la transidentité et de ""ce que c'est qu'être une femme"". Vous en recevrez automatiquement une copie en PDF dès 5€ de dons. </li></ul>
<ul><li>""L’Écrasée"" est le recueil principal ; il contient ""La Belle &amp; la Bête"", ainsi que des dizaines d'autres poèmes (plus de 70). Vous le recevrez en PDF à partir de 10€ de dons, et en format papier (par la poste) à partir de 20€ de dons.</li></ul>
<ul><li>""Écris-moi un poème"" est une compensation prévue pour les dons particulièrement élevés (250€ et plus). Pour les donateurs les plus généreux, j'écrirais un poème qui leur sera dédié ; sur eux-mêmes ou sur le thème de leur choix. Ils pourront décider, après l'avoir lu, de voir le poème inclus dans le recueil ou choisir de le garder pour eux. </li></ul>
<div> </div>
</div><h3>Qui est Clara, et où vont les fonds ?</h3><p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">Clara est née en 1988 dans une banlieue perdue de Paris. A 8 ans, elle commence à écrire des poèmes ; à 11 ans, elle écrit ses premières règles de jeux de rôles et de jeux vidéos. Deux habitudes qui ne l'ont toujours pas quittée, 20 ans plus tard. Aujourd'hui, elle est gérante d'une petite entreprise de jeux vidéos, Inner Seas, qui est responsable entre autres de la création et de la publication de la série de jeux de rôles indépendants ""Winter Voices"" dont le thème principal est le deuil et le rapport à la famille. Un jeu vidéo contemplatif et inhabituel qui a été salué par la critique pour son originalité et ses qualités artistiques. Un livre tiré du jeu devrait paraître courant 2016. </span></p><p><span style=""background-color: initial;""><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Quoiqu'aimant bien les barbes et trouvant la sienne fort plaisante, Clara </span>préférerait idéalement admirer celle des autres et avoir la peau un peu plus douce. C'est pour elle moins une question de genre qu'une histoire de perception et d'identité physique.<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> Après tout, Clara n'est pas spécialement ""féminine"" - elle aime le bricolage, les jeux vidéo, porter des jeans troués, draguer les jeunes femmes sans défense, sans même parler des sciences et de l'informatique qui sont des sujets qui la fascinent. Mais de nos jours, fort heureusement, rien de tout ça n'empêche d'être une femme. </span></span></p><p><span style=""background-color: initial;""><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Elle a donc décidé en 2014, après dix ans de réflexion, d'engager des procédures médicales visant à la transformer en femme un peu plus ""normale"". Ces opérations sont coûteuses, et Clara ne gagne pas beaucoup d'argent. Ecrire des livres et développer des jeux vidéos qui parlent des relations humaines, du deuil, de la plasticité de l'esprit et des émotions rapporte étrangement moins d'argent que faire des jeux où l'on tue des dragons. (si vous ne comprenez pas pourquoi, soyez rassurés : elle non plus - même si au demeurant elle adore tuer des dragons) </span></span></p><p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">Les fonds serviront à l'aider financièrement et à financer ses dépenses médicales diverses et variées. La sécurité sociale française ne rembourse pas ou peu les frais médicaux liés à la transidentité. La France est, malheureusement, un pays très en retard sur la question transidentitaire, au sein de l'europe. </span></p><p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">Une liste non-exhaustive des frais médicaux :</span></p><p> </p><ul>
<li><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">Chirurgie : 13 000€ (il faut aller au Canada ou en Thaïlande)</span></li>
<li><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">Conservation de fertilité : 700€+100€/an (il faut aller en Belgique ou en Espagne)</span></li>
<li><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">Hormonothérapie : 600€/an</span></li>
<li><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">Laser Visage : 1000€</span></li>
</ul><div>L'objectif de la levée de fond est à 5000€. Si la levée de fond venait à dépasser 15 000€, l'excédent serait reversé à Inner Seas Editions pour permettre l'écriture et la publications d'ouvrages différents et intéressants. </div><div> </div><div>

<blockquote>Quand elle revient à elle, quelle n'est pas sa surprise<br/>De se voir revenue dans sa vieille maison !<br/>« Quel mauvais, mauvais rêve. » se dit-elle. Un frisson<br/>La secoue, sur le lit où elle se trouve assise.<br/><br/>Elle regarde ses mains et se glace d'effroi.<br/>Sa peau douce est un cuir où pousse une fourrure<br/>Ses ongles sont des griffes, son torse est une armure<br/>De chair épaisse où son gigantesque cœur bat<br/><br/>Quand sa mère l'aperçoit, elle crie de ravissement<br/>« Quelle Bête magnifique ! Lourde et forte à la fois ! »<br/>Et ses sœurs applaudissent ; et son père, la voyant<br/>Se gonfle de fierté et la prend dans ses bras<br/><br/>« Mais je suis votre fille, ne le voyez-vous pas ? »<br/>Leur hurle-t-elle, terrible, de sa voix de caverne<br/>Rien n'y fait.

""L’Écrasée"", c'est un recueil de poésie ; mais c'est aussi une histoire disloquée, décousue, faite de petits bouts de vie étalés de 2005 à 2015.
L'histoire d'une femme Clara, et d'un homme, Kévin, qui sont en réalité une seule et même personne ; l'histoire de leur rencontre, de leur tentative de vivre ensemble dix ans durant, sans se toucher, sans respirer de peur de se gêner ; et finalement, l'histoire de leur abandon, l'un à l'autre, ou l'un sans l'autre.
""Mais la malédiction n'est l'effet que du coeur ; Nous n'avons pour destin que le bruit de nos âmes""... Il est toujours possible de changer les choses. 
C'est là que vous pouvez participer.
Clara est transgenre. Elle a besoin de plusieurs milliers d'euros pour payer ses frais médicaux. Ils ne sont pas nécessaires pour survivre, mais ils le sont pour vivre - ce n'est pas toujours le plus facile. Clara n'a rien à vous offrir en échange, que ce qu'elle a fait toute sa vie, sans raison, parfois contre sa volonté : de la poésie. De la poésie bancale, ça ne vaut pas grand chose ; mais il y a eu des jours où la vie de Clara ne tenait qu'à un poème bancal.
En offrant à Clara les moyens de vivre, elle vous offrira des poèmes. Des poèmes bancals, mais qui vous toucheront peut-être.

Qui est Clara, et où vont les fonds ?Clara est née en 1988 dans une banlieue perdue de Paris. A 8 ans, elle commence à écrire des poèmes ; à 11 ans, elle écrit ses premières règles de jeux de rôles et de jeux vidéos. Deux habitudes qui ne l'ont toujours pas quittée, 20 ans plus tard. Aujourd'hui, elle est gérante d'une petite entreprise de jeux vidéos, Inner Seas, qui est responsable entre autres de la création et de la publication de la série de jeux de rôles indépendants ""Winter Voices"" dont le thème principal est le deuil et le rapport à la famille. Un jeu vidéo contemplatif et inhabituel qui a été salué par la critique pour son originalité et ses qualités artistiques. Un livre tiré du jeu devrait paraître courant 2016. Quoiqu'aimant bien les barbes et trouvant la sienne fort plaisante, Clara préférerait idéalement admirer celle des autres et avoir la peau un peu plus douce. C'est pour elle moins une question de genre qu'une histoire de perception et d'identité physique. Après tout, Clara n'est pas spécialement ""féminine"" - elle aime le bricolage, les jeux vidéo, porter des jeans troués, draguer les jeunes femmes sans défense, sans même parler des sciences et de l'informatique qui sont des sujets qui la fascinent. Mais de nos jours, fort heureusement, rien de tout ça n'empêche d'être une femme. Elle a donc décidé en 2014, après dix ans de réflexion, d'engager des procédures médicales visant à la transformer en femme un peu plus ""normale"". Ces opérations sont coûteuses, et Clara ne gagne pas beaucoup d'argent. Ecrire des livres et développer des jeux vidéos qui parlent des relations humaines, du deuil, de la plasticité de l'esprit et des émotions rapporte étrangement moins d'argent que faire des jeux où l'on tue des dragons. (si vous ne comprenez pas pourquoi, soyez rassurés : elle non plus - même si au demeurant elle adore tuer des dragons) Les fonds serviront à l'aider financièrement et à financer ses dépenses médicales diverses et variées. La sécurité sociale française ne rembourse pas ou peu les frais médicaux liés à la transidentité. La France est, malheureusement, un pays très en retard sur la question transidentitaire, au sein de l'europe. Une liste non-exhaustive des frais médicaux : 
Chirurgie : 13 000€ (il faut aller au Canada ou en Thaïlande)
Conservation de fertilité : 700€+100€/an (il faut aller en Belgique ou en Espagne)
Hormonothérapie : 600€/an
Laser Visage : 1000€
L'objectif de la levée de fond est à 5000€. Si la levée de fond venait à dépasser 15 000€, l'excédent serait reversé à Inner Seas Editions pour permettre l'écriture et la publications d'ouvrages différents et intéressants.  
Le Recueil
""L'Ecrasée et autres poèmes"" est un recueil de plus de 70 poèmes écrits pour la plupart entre 2005 et 2015. Le recueil est constitué des 7 parties suivantes :
 

""Clara & Kévin"" (poèmes autobiographiques)
""La Belle et la Bête"" (poème unique traitant de la transidentité)
""Poèmes pour des passants"" (poème écrits pour des gens croisés au fil de la vie)
""Poèmes pour Jeux"" (poèmes écrits dans le cadre de la création de jeux vidéos)
""Poèmes pour Rire ou par Hasard"" (poèmes écrits pour des événements divers ou pour le plaisir)
""Poèmes d'Adolescence"" (une sélection de poèmes écrits entre 12 ans et 18 ans)
""Poèmes d'Enfance"" (une sélection de poèmes écrits entre 8 et 12 ans)

 
Quelques Extraits
Quand elle revient à elle, quelle n'est pas sa surpriseDe se voir revenue dans sa vieille maison !« Quel mauvais, mauvais rêve. » se dit-elle. Un frissonLa secoue, sur le lit où elle se trouve assise.Elle regarde ses mains et se glace d'effroi.Sa peau douce est un cuir où pousse une fourrureSes ongles sont des griffes, son torse est une armureDe chair épaisse où son gigantesque cœur batQuand sa mère l'aperçoit, elle crie de ravissement« Quelle Bête magnifique ! Lourde et forte à la fois ! »Et ses sœurs applaudissent ; et son père, la voyantSe gonfle de fierté et la prend dans ses bras« Mais je suis votre fille, ne le voyez-vous pas ? »Leur hurle-t-elle, terrible, de sa voix de caverneRien n'y fait. Quoi qu'elle dise, ils ne l'entendent pas« Notre fille ? Quelle sottise ! Que sont ces balivernes ? »

<p><i>And before you go there, no.</i></p>
<p><i>Not because I was in my 30's now and I
was mourning for my lost youth…</i></p>
<p><i>At
first I thought someone had slipped a dose of acid into my Aviation cocktail.
There was this weird, trippy, muddy-headed dizziness, a warping in my mind that
made me close my eyes tightly against it. And when I opened them, I was seated
on the huge area rug that Isabelle had dragged up to the roof, just for my
party. I couldn’t recall walking over to it and sitting down. I was only on my
second drink, so there was no way I was anywhere near drunk and we hadn't
opened the Absinthe yet, so I couldn't exactly blame it on that either. So what
else could it have been? </i></p>
<p><i>""Asshole!"" I
stood up and yelled across the roof of my three story building. Not my usual
language, but really, who drugs you at your own birthday party? ""Who
slipped me the acid?""</i>                                                                                                                                                                                               </p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/632083/files/20140607094903-TriFluer.jpg?1402159743"" src="""" style=""width: 146px; height: 55px;""/></p><p><br/></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>
<p><i>And then he kissed me. Bliss. Ah,
blissful, wonderful kisses that erased any other thoughts. And then he was
pushing me back gently, down into the softness of the couch, his hands caught
up in my hair, his mouth crushed against mine. Hard, deep kisses that made
everything seem normal. Because Death doesn’t have makeout sessions, right? He
came up for air, pushing my hair from my face…</i></p>

<p><i>Should
I say it? Tell him what I was really thinking about him? Could he take this
life from me? What little of a life it was. Why was he here, and how had I
ended up alone with him again? </i></p>
<p><i>And what was that feeling?
A prickling up the back of my neck, a sharpness through my mind. That whisper
wrapping through my psyche. </i></p>
<p><b><i>Milseachd</i></b></p>
<p><i>I
fought it, gritted my teeth against it. “I was just telling Liam how you need
to stop being such an ass.” And there it was. Out. A giant matzo ball. Did his
left eye just twitch? Oh, he did not look too pleased at all.</i></p>
<p><i>“Excuse
me?” he stood and I backed up a step before I realized that I was even moving. </i></p>
<p><i>But
my mouth was on a roll. “You need to stop being an ass. You’re cold and
unfeeling and could have handled all of this business with me, I’m sure, in a
much better way. There had to have been a better way. It might be some kind of
same old everyday bullshit for you, but for me this was monumental. Did you
forget that? Has it been so long since it happened to you that you don’t remember?
What it was like to lose everything, everyone, that meant anything to you. To
be ripped away from it all. Or maybe you were never human. Maybe you were
always…this.”</i></p>

 is she different Gideon? Liam asked, concern etched across his face. 
“She’s so different. There’s something about her, so…” </i></p><p><i> 
I saw Liam speaking with Gideon. Could see him through the window and 
the sheer curtains of Elysium. I could hear them clearly, right through 
the glass, even though a crow and a seagull were having an unceasing 
argument over head, making a grand racket. </i></p><p><i> 
My attention left the window and focused on the gull that kept swooping 
down at the crow where he sat staunchly perched on the uppermost branch 
of a tree. </i></p><p><i>My gaze fell back to Liam and Gideon inside the coffee house, but I couldn’t hear them anymore. </i></p><p><i>A
 massive, blustery wind kicked up suddenly, pushing me away from the now
 hazy window, and dry fall leaves on the ground came swirling into the 
air. I could feel them against my back, brushing against my bare 
shoulders. Where had my coat gone? I’d just had my coat on, now I was 
just wearing some kind of corseted top. The leaves were making my back 
itch where they relentlessly struck my skin. I closed my eyes as a 
bundle of orange, red, and brown blew against my face, pushed them away 
with my hands.</i></p><p><i> 
I heard music, heard laughing. I opened my eyes.</i></p><p><i>
 
It was my old rooftop, and my party decorations, but I didn’t recognize 
anyone.There was the couch.There was me. And all the people dressed in 
beautiful black clothing were pointing at me. This me, not the one on 
the couch. But this breathing, confused version.</i></p><p><i>
 
I backed away, bumping into something warm and very solid, large, much 
larger than a person. I could smell it before I turned. Honey-like, hay,
 sunshine, dust, musk. </i></p><p><i>Horse. </i></p><p><i> 
I turned and ran my hands down his flank. I marveled at his strength and
 beauty. A Friesian. A horse of war. He was here for me. He was mine 
now.I climbed onto him using the arm of the couch to boost myself up to 
his grand height. He wore no saddle and I could feel his muscles and raw
 power beneath me, my legs, could sense the urgency in the great animal 
to leave. He began his trek across the roof, knocking aside the ones 
that laughed at me. Though their mouths were no longer open in cackling 
amusement, but in shock and awe, and contempt.This horse, my horse, 
Eyvindur—that word, his name, whispered through my brain, through 
me—cantered across the rooftop… </i></p><p><i>And right over the ledge.</i></p><p><i>
 
No! My heart jumped and then dropped to my stomach. I twined my hands 
tightly through his silky mane, squeezing my eyes shut—waiting for the 
inevitable plunge. We dipped, I felt us plummet…then we lifted, remained
 aloft, and we were flying.I felt pure joy. Overwhelming elation as we 
soared over the city, hidden in the night, cool briny ocean air ruffling
 through my hair. </i></p><p><i> 
Until I saw them. The people from the roof. They were behind us. They 
were pursuing us. I let go of Eyvindur’s mane and let loose my bolts at 
them. Arrows? Where had those come from? One struck, and I watched as 
the hideous tracker fell from the sky, spiraling downward. Then they 
were upon us, my bow was ripped from my hands. The maddened creatures 
pulled and tore at Eyvindur. They scratched at my legs and pulled 
feathers from my wings. </i></p><p><i> 
My wings?</i></p><p><i>
 
I screamed. The pain was searing. My back was on fire from the shredding
 of my wings by their claws. I cried out and twisted from their grasp, 
fell from Eyvindur’s back, tumbling down through the night sky, as the 
ocean below rushed up to greet me. <br/></i></p><p><i><br/></i></p>
<p>Merely a peek into <b><i>No Time to Cry</i></b>, Tome One in <b><i>The Nine While Nine
Legacy</i></b>.</p>
<p><b><i>No Time to Cry </i></b>is an urban dark fantasy novel, with touches of paranormal romance and chick lit. </p><p>Isabelle has life right where she wants it after recovering 
from heartbreak and deceit. She has the perfect apartment, amazing 
friends, a flourishing career, and financial security. </p><p>But one 
fateful night, the night of her birthday bash, events take place which 
alter that life beyond her wildest imaginings…and she is no longer 
Isabella. </p><p>		She’s thrust quickly into the most secretive 
inner-workings of Death itself, as well as an otherworldly dominion of 
ancient Celtic magic, and beings that we were taught as children were 
only fictional creations of wildly whimsical minds. </p><p>She yearns 
for the now unmistakable simplicity of her old life; this one is full of
 dangers, unanswered questions and cryptic dreams. And whispers, 
haunting whispers in her mind that send shivers through her…but in the 
most agreeable way. </p><p>After one particularly anomalous dream in which she learns of the Nine While Nine Legacy, things get truly precarious.</p><p>
<i>“Nine Will Rise, Nine Will Fall, The Old Shall Replace the New, The New Shall Be the Old"" </i></p><p>				Now someone sees her as a risk …and wants to eliminate her.</p><p>
	But she falls under the protection of her guardian—unless she leaves 
his territory—which is the one thing wants the most…and wants the least.

 though the spelling is weil. In the ancient unwritten language of Na 
Daoine Maithe, it is as close of a phonetic spelling as can be 
ascertained, and means <i>eradicate</i>.
Nine is also the number of judgement and finality…completeness. </p><p>Nine will rise and Nine will fall,,,,<br/></p><p>A war is coming, a new world order, but nothing like what was to be expected!<br/></p>

<p>Not just because the voices of my characters are
constantly screaming at me to do so!</p>
<p>But also because,
books are an excellent way to escape our everyday lives which can sometimes become
humdrum in sameness. Or maybe you had a bad day, or maybe you just want to go
somewhere that you can’t get to in real life. Books can do that. I love writing
truly fantastical stories full of details, so there is an opportunity for an
even deeper diversion. </p>
<p>It started for me in high school; I wasn’t part of the “in”
crowd. I was quiet, bookish, a wee introverted. So generally at breaks and
lunch I could be found in the quad with a good book. My summers tended to be on
the lonely side, with friends going on family vacations and such, so I’d spend
hours digging through the boxes in our garage plundering the many cartons of
written treasures which my Mom had stored away there. Summers were spent by the
pool reading, and it didn’t feel quite so lonely; I learned how to let my mind
wander and explore all kinds of eccentric worlds and possibilities.</p>
<p>I started creating stories at that time, they never went
far at that age, but over the years of gaining experiences, and encountering a
wide array of emotions and life scenarios, by my 30’s I was quite primed to get
going. I wanted to create something that could let people feel the way that I
felt when reading a book. Whether it was connecting to an empowered character,
or just losing myself in a faraway land, it always healed any emotional wounds
or exhaustion I may have endured that day.</p>
<p>I want to give that to others…exciting adventures, a

And before you go there, no.
Not because I was in my 30's now and I
was mourning for my lost youth…
At
first I thought someone had slipped a dose of acid into my Aviation cocktail.
There was this weird, trippy, muddy-headed dizziness, a warping in my mind that
made me close my eyes tightly against it. And when I opened them, I was seated
on the huge area rug that Isabelle had dragged up to the roof, just for my
party. I couldn’t recall walking over to it and sitting down. I was only on my
second drink, so there was no way I was anywhere near drunk and we hadn't
opened the Absinthe yet, so I couldn't exactly blame it on that either. So what
else could it have been? 
""Asshole!"" I
stood up and yelled across the roof of my three story building. Not my usual
language, but really, who drugs you at your own birthday party? ""Who
slipped me the acid?""                                                                                                                                                                                               
And then he kissed me. Bliss. Ah,
blissful, wonderful kisses that erased any other thoughts. And then he was
pushing me back gently, down into the softness of the couch, his hands caught
up in my hair, his mouth crushed against mine. Hard, deep kisses that made
everything seem normal. Because Death doesn’t have makeout sessions, right? He
came up for air, pushing my hair from my face…

Should
I say it? Tell him what I was really thinking about him? Could he take this
life from me? What little of a life it was. Why was he here, and how had I
ended up alone with him again? 
And what was that feeling?
A prickling up the back of my neck, a sharpness through my mind. That whisper
wrapping through my psyche. 
Milseachd
I
fought it, gritted my teeth against it. “I was just telling Liam how you need
to stop being such an ass.” And there it was. Out. A giant matzo ball. Did his
left eye just twitch? Oh, he did not look too pleased at all.
“Excuse
me?” he stood and I backed up a step before I realized that I was even moving. 
But
my mouth was on a roll. “You need to stop being an ass. You’re cold and
unfeeling and could have handled all of this business with me, I’m sure, in a
much better way. There had to have been a better way. It might be some kind of
same old everyday bullshit for you, but for me this was monumental. Did you
forget that? Has it been so long since it happened to you that you don’t remember?
What it was like to lose everything, everyone, that meant anything to you. To
be ripped away from it all. Or maybe you were never human. Maybe you were
always…this.”
“Why
 is she different Gideon? Liam asked, concern etched across his face. 
“She’s so different. There’s something about her, so…”  
I saw Liam speaking with Gideon. Could see him through the window and 
the sheer curtains of Elysium. I could hear them clearly, right through 
the glass, even though a crow and a seagull were having an unceasing 
argument over head, making a grand racket.  
My attention left the window and focused on the gull that kept swooping 
down at the crow where he sat staunchly perched on the uppermost branch 
of a tree. My gaze fell back to Liam and Gideon inside the coffee house, but I couldn’t hear them anymore. A
 massive, blustery wind kicked up suddenly, pushing me away from the now
 hazy window, and dry fall leaves on the ground came swirling into the 
air. I could feel them against my back, brushing against my bare 
shoulders. Where had my coat gone? I’d just had my coat on, now I was 
just wearing some kind of corseted top. The leaves were making my back 
itch where they relentlessly struck my skin. I closed my eyes as a 
bundle of orange, red, and brown blew against my face, pushed them away 
with my hands. 
I heard music, heard laughing. I opened my eyes.
 
It was my old rooftop, and my party decorations, but I didn’t recognize 
anyone.There was the couch.There was me. And all the people dressed in 
beautiful black clothing were pointing at me. This me, not the one on 
the couch. But this breathing, confused version.
 
I backed away, bumping into something warm and very solid, large, much 
larger than a person. I could smell it before I turned. Honey-like, hay,
 sunshine, dust, musk. Horse.  
I turned and ran my hands down his flank. I marveled at his strength and
 beauty. A Friesian. A horse of war. He was here for me. He was mine 
now.I climbed onto him using the arm of the couch to boost myself up to 
his grand height. He wore no saddle and I could feel his muscles and raw
 power beneath me, my legs, could sense the urgency in the great animal 
to leave. He began his trek across the roof, knocking aside the ones 
that laughed at me. Though their mouths were no longer open in cackling 
amusement, but in shock and awe, and contempt.This horse, my horse, 
Eyvindur—that word, his name, whispered through my brain, through 
me—cantered across the rooftop… And right over the ledge.
 
No! My heart jumped and then dropped to my stomach. I twined my hands 
tightly through his silky mane, squeezing my eyes shut—waiting for the 
inevitable plunge. We dipped, I felt us plummet…then we lifted, remained
 aloft, and we were flying.I felt pure joy. Overwhelming elation as we 
soared over the city, hidden in the night, cool briny ocean air ruffling
 through my hair.  
Until I saw them. The people from the roof. They were behind us. They 
were pursuing us. I let go of Eyvindur’s mane and let loose my bolts at 
them. Arrows? Where had those come from? One struck, and I watched as 
the hideous tracker fell from the sky, spiraling downward. Then they 
were upon us, my bow was ripped from my hands. The maddened creatures 
pulled and tore at Eyvindur. They scratched at my legs and pulled 
feathers from my wings.  
My wings?
 
I screamed. The pain was searing. My back was on fire from the shredding
 of my wings by their claws. I cried out and twisted from their grasp, 
fell from Eyvindur’s back, tumbling down through the night sky, as the 
ocean below rushed up to greet me. 
Merely a peek into No Time to Cry, Tome One in The Nine While Nine
Legacy.
No Time to Cry is an urban dark fantasy novel, with touches of paranormal romance and chick lit. Isabelle has life right where she wants it after recovering 
from heartbreak and deceit. She has the perfect apartment, amazing 
friends, a flourishing career, and financial security. But one 
fateful night, the night of her birthday bash, events take place which 
alter that life beyond her wildest imaginings…and she is no longer 
Isabella. 		She’s thrust quickly into the most secretive 
inner-workings of Death itself, as well as an otherworldly dominion of 
ancient Celtic magic, and beings that we were taught as children were 
only fictional creations of wildly whimsical minds. She yearns 
for the now unmistakable simplicity of her old life; this one is full of
 dangers, unanswered questions and cryptic dreams. And whispers, 
haunting whispers in her mind that send shivers through her…but in the 
most agreeable way. After one particularly anomalous dream in which she learns of the Nine While Nine Legacy, things get truly precarious.
“Nine Will Rise, Nine Will Fall, The Old Shall Replace the New, The New Shall Be the Old"" 				Now someone sees her as a risk …and wants to eliminate her.
	But she falls under the protection of her guardian—unless she leaves 
his territory—which is the one thing wants the most…and wants the least.
		

I'm not telling you much more about
the book, because the way the book is written is meant to be a journey of discovery and surprises.  Periodically
 I will be posting excerpts from the chapters on the blog at my website,
 but not too much! I don't want to spoil the story!   	Nine While Nine is a compression of the decree asserting the 
ancient edict that at the apposite time the Choir of Nine that usurped 
the Nine Realms of Na Daoine Maithe would fall and the original nine 
would take their rightful place. The word “while” in this case holds a double meaning. In old high German it is time,
 though the spelling is weil. In the ancient unwritten language of Na 
Daoine Maithe, it is as close of a phonetic spelling as can be 
ascertained, and means eradicate.
Nine is also the number of judgement and finality…completeness. Nine will rise and Nine will fall,,,,A war is coming, a new world order, but nothing like what was to be expected!
For
more about the story, character bios, my blog, and much much more, go to: www.stasiamorineaux.wix.com/stasia-morineauxI'm
raising money for the production of my book. The funds raised will be going
towards cover design, editorial assessment, promotional materials, and a
marketing plan, as well as printing.
This novel has to be submitted for
editing and art work, as well as for the creation of all promotional items, in
just 3 months…so that it can all be ready for the debut in New Orleans this
Halloween at the Undead Con! 
Any funds raised that go over the
goal will go towards further promotions and the publication of Book Two!My name is Stasia Morineaux.  
I grew up in Southern California, pursuing
faeries in the garden, hunting down things that went bump in the night, and seeking
spirits in the local graveyard.
After “growing up”, I still do all
of that!
I love roaming the rain drenched
streets of New Orleans, creating costumes, and playing Just
Dance with my family...because that's just silly!
A few years ago I resettled in not-too-far-north-of-Charlotte, North Carolina
with my hubby, daughter, and our bevy of creatures…both real and “imaginary”.
Mysterious dreams, copious hours of awesome music, and obscene amounts of
coffee fuel my lengthy writing sessions, which consists mostly of paranormal
romance, chick lit, urban fantasy, and dark fantasy.
In my spare time I like to relax on my balcony, feet kicked up, listening to
the squirrels arguing with the crows in the trees.
For the past 4 years, I've been
writing, plotting, and scheming my first novel to be released, No
Time to Cry, and the world in which those characters live.
Not just because the voices of my characters are
constantly screaming at me to do so!
But also because,
books are an excellent way to escape our everyday lives which can sometimes become
humdrum in sameness. Or maybe you had a bad day, or maybe you just want to go
somewhere that you can’t get to in real life. Books can do that. I love writing
truly fantastical stories full of details, so there is an opportunity for an
even deeper diversion. 
It started for me in high school; I wasn’t part of the “in”
crowd. I was quiet, bookish, a wee introverted. So generally at breaks and
lunch I could be found in the quad with a good book. My summers tended to be on
the lonely side, with friends going on family vacations and such, so I’d spend
hours digging through the boxes in our garage plundering the many cartons of
written treasures which my Mom had stored away there. Summers were spent by the
pool reading, and it didn’t feel quite so lonely; I learned how to let my mind
wander and explore all kinds of eccentric worlds and possibilities.
I started creating stories at that time, they never went
far at that age, but over the years of gaining experiences, and encountering a
wide array of emotions and life scenarios, by my 30’s I was quite primed to get
going. I wanted to create something that could let people feel the way that I
felt when reading a book. Whether it was connecting to an empowered character,
or just losing myself in a faraway land, it always healed any emotional wounds
or exhaustion I may have endured that day.
I want to give that to others…exciting adventures, a
safe place to escape that maybe, just maybe might bring them moments of joy, or
laughter, or thrills.
So why am I launching an Indiegogo campaign for this project rather than the traditional publishing route?
Because as an independent creator I
want this story to reach an audience. I don’t want it to bounce around the U.S.
postal service or lay around a publishing company’s slush pile for what could
turn into years. 
I also want it to remain true to my
vision.Other than fixing some possible
typos and grammatical inaccuracies I really don’t want the feel of my story to
be altered in any way. 
The publishing world has changed in
dramatic ways over the past few years. The old model isn't working terribly
well for most authors of the new variety; I believe it's time to explore other
avenues for getting our work into the world.
No Time to Cry, book one in The Nine While Nine Legacy is nearly done.
With the right marketing plan, it and the rest of the Saga are destined for
great things. (and I can keep writing!)Your help. Quite simply, I need your help and generosity to make this happen.You won't leave empty handed, you're gonna get some pretty cool rewards! Even
 better, is having old friends, and new found friends, joining me on 
this adventure of a lifetime; The rare opportunity to create something

something that can inspire, intrigue and perhaps enhance lives! So,

My name
is Luis Felipe Passalacqua, former Medical Illustrator, karate instructor,
dancer, horseback rider, arts professor, speaker, writer and Puerto Rico’s first and only Blind
Sculptor. I was not born blind;
therefore all of my life experiences have given me great understanding in the
development of these projects. After working on this bio-fiction for about a year
and finally publishing it in Spanish last September, I’m very excited to
announce our plans to translate and publish my book in ENGLISH!!! 


Based on my life, the story captures the
essence of some extreme and compelling experiences that evoke a life full of
contrasts, which will certainly confront your most intimate perceptions. I've dissected the memories of my childhood and entire adult life in order to reveal
some provoking, transformative occurrences. It incites the radical, the obscure
and mysterious in all of us. We
are confronted by an oppressive inequality that demands evolution. It is a path
of understanding the dissolution of our perceptions and realities, our freedom.
It comes from the core. Arts, science, and belief structures converge in this
profound search for independence. 


Your sponsorship is all I need to bring this beautiful                  and influential book to others.





NEEDS  


I’m
thrilled to be collaborating once again with Author-House to bring this book to
you. Because of its significance and our efforts to bring this project to life,
I’m asking for your commitment to help cover the cost of editing and publishing
to make this happen. 




If the goal of $5000 is achieved, the remainder of $394 will be used for marketing purposes.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>After two years of publishing Canada’s freshest literary magazine as a free online edition located at <a href=""http://dragnetmag.net/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://dragnetmag.net</a>, we’ve decided to answer the clamouring of our fans and produce a print version. The anthology will feature our favourite pieces from the first two years and eight issues of the magazine. As well as fiction and poetry, it will also feature black and white line drawings on the inside by one of the artists featured in a past issue of Dragnet (to be decided), and a cover by another featured artist. It will be a trade paperback, measuring 6 x 9 inches, and will be 128 pages in length, which gives us room to provide you with lots of Dragnet content!</p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
</div>
<div>
<p>Pre-order the Dragnet anthology at a discount to help us print it! We need $1190 up front to print 300 copies of the anthology with a local family-run printing company. You can pre-order the book for $15, $20, or $30 depending on where you are located. Please scroll down in the ""perks"" section on the right to select any of the anthology pre-order options. The “perks” section also lists other incentives for donating more or less than the cost of a book.</p>
<p>If we make more than the target, the money will go towards our other expenses, which we struggle to pay solely through donations at our launch parties: paying contributors, purchasing marketing materials, paying website costs, throwing events to bring creative communities together—and saving up to produce a print anthology of years three and four! Everyone on the Dragnet team is a volunteer, and all of our income goes toward costs.</p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
</div>
<div>You get a lovely book to read wherever you want, even if you have no internet connection or way to charge your cell phone or e-reader, we get the chance to produce something we’re really proud of, and our contributors get the wider exposure they deserve.</div>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>

</div></div>","About Me
My name is Susan Wilson and I'm currently serving as Georgetown University's Entrepreneur in Residence.  I’m a 41 year old wife, mother and FORTUNE Top Ten Entrepreneur and I’m frustrated women aren't discussing the personal realities that go with professional success.
By examining the demographics, personal choices and realities of Forbes and FORTUNE Top Ranked women, I hope to paint a more realistic and holistic picture of what success looks like for women today.  And ideally, I hope to uncover trends and insights we can all learn from and appreciate.


Background
Just as males are hardwired to be competitive hunters, females are communal gatherers.  Our complementary genetics are how and why the human species has actually survived - which is an important point to remember btw.  
So a woman's natural preference to collaborate and communicate is actually a gender trait not a choice (or character flaw).  And before this becomes an all or nothing distracting debate, I'll readily admit this isn't true for every female.  So let's continue.  As a direct result of our genetic hard-wiring, females see ourselves in relation to others.  Whether we're babies, girls, teens or women, our personal happiness is directly (and naturally) based on how we see ourselves in relation (and compared) to others - primarily other women.



The Project
I want to create a collection of simple, easy-to-understand infographics about the REAL lives of top-ranked women to shed some light on the personal choices and tradeoffs that come with professional success.  The end product will be a printed guide or manual and a poster that tells a visual story of what the data reveals.
I plan to dig into the personal details of top-ranked
professional women so we can understand what works as well as interesting patterns or trends hidden within the data.  This isn't about stereotyping, judging or throwing stones.  It's simply about aggregating data (i.e., the facts) to get to the truth.   For example:
·       
Why
are some women so successful? Are they
smarter? Do they work harder?
·       
How
important is WHO you know? Is it
exponential compared to WHAT you know?
·        How does each woman lead?  Manage?  Mentor?  Do age, status or location matter?
·       
Is it
possible to be happy AND successful at home AND work?  If so, for how long?
·        Do kids hinder or help a woman succeed?  Babies?  Teens?  What about pets?
·        Does it matter if you come from money?  Do nannies & housekeepers play a role?
The Details
This information has been readily available and in the public domain for years.  It simply hasn’t been aggregated & analyzed in this manner for this purpose.  With your help, I'll take a deep data
dive into popular annual lists of successful women including:
·       
Forbes The World’s 100 Most Powerful
Women for 2011 
·       
2011 FORTUNE Most
Powerful Women Summit 
·       
Forbes 2011
Highest Paid Female Athletes
·       
12 of
FORTUNE 500 companies run by women 
The research and data will come from public
sources including the U.S. Census, voter records, political donors, court records, marriage, divorce, birth & death records along with facebook,
twitter, and LinkedIn.  
Proceeds will be used to fund dedicated research, drafting text and visuals to create infographics (along with revisions), finalizing, printing and distributing the the end-products which includes color infograpics and guides (PDFs and printed), t-shirts, and posters - which I anticipate will take 3-4 months to complete.

The Role You Can Play in this Groundbreaking & Practical Project
The easiest thing you can do is to simply show your support.  Give $5 or $500.  Or just spread the word on twitter or facebook.  This is about the power of the crowd!  And to prove that, I'm going to share my initial findings with key contributors and open it up to the crowd as we discuss obvious and potential trends as well as interesting anomalies.

If you don't need tutoring services, I will give you a free download copy of the work. I may even plan to have a blow-out party bash where I can thank my contributors personally! I would love to give you more, such as cash, but then if I had it, I wouldn't need to fundraise for it!
 

ULTIMATE IMPACT? People struggling with faith or questioning God will find encouragement. Others will be ministered to. I will have the chance to hear God say, as far as my talents, ""Well done, good and faithful servant.""
IF YOU CAN'T HELP WITH CASH? Any support, even your prayers, or just telling others about my goal, is just as powerful!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Forest farming is different from forest gardening, which according to <a href=""http://www.edibleforestgardens.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Dave Jacke</a> is ""gardening like the forest.""

With careful planning, hard work, open and direct communication as well as honest and meaningful collaboration, we can turn publishing into a win-win situation between English-language authors and their Chinese readers. We are talking about a market in which readers are keen to freely read, understand, express and communicate. They are keen to feel the pulse of the world.So this is a project also valuable to the world's English-language authors who are keen to understand their Chinese peers. A good story can be universal, as long as we let it be read in different languages. Your literary voice can be heard in the Chinese world as long as you make it loud and clear. Other Ways You Can HelpFor the completion of ""Reaching for 1.5 Billion Chinese Readers: A Guide to Self-Publishing in the Chinese World"" as an ebook, you can help by sending a word of encouragement to Christine at her blog ""Voices under the Sun"" (http://christinesunflower.com/). You can tell her what you, as an English-language author, agent, publisher and/or reader, would like to know via this valuable ebook. You can also help by spreading the word and ""make some noise"" about Christine's campaign.Finally, Christine would like to thank you for reading this campaign introduction. She looks forward to hearing from you.Sincerely, Christine Yunn-Yu Sun, Melbourne, Australia.",6.0,0,"1 Campaign

After starting her job as part of the Calculation Exhibit, she begins to moonlight in the Smoking Exhibit. My book tells the story of her various attempts to quit smoking.</span></h3>

The second level of costs go towards creating all of the multimedia that will make the USB great. Your money will go directly towards all of the great artists involved in this project.

The Story

I am trying to self publish my first book comrade calculator Quits Smoking. It is a multi-media novel and so I want the first edition of the novel to be published on USB ""cigarettes."" These USBs will contain the book in various e-reader formats, a seven song soundtrack, videos, and art work.

You could call the novel science fiction because it's set very far in the future. I prefer to call it math fiction, but I’ll let you decide. Here is a short synopsis:
comrade calculator is a humanoid female robot built to live indefinitely. The idea at the time was if she could live forever, getting replacement organs as needed, she could one day calculate infinity. Over a hundred years (and one answer) later she is living and working in the museum of the Twentieth Century. After starting her job as part of the Calculation Exhibit, she begins to moonlight in the Smoking Exhibit. My book tells the story of her various attempts to quit smoking.

 Read the first two chapters here (here for mobile readers).





The Author


I am a twenty-seven year old English Literature and Math teacher at a local international high-school. I try to find time where ever I can for writing. I’ve had a poem published. I also have just recently launched my own website where you can read more of my writing, including the first two chapters of the novel.

This book has been kicking around in my mind for over eight years. I spent two years working part-time tutoring nights so that I could plan and write these eight chapters. Sixty thousand six hundred and sixty eight words later I’m ready to go. But as you can see from the synopsis above it is not a ‘normal’ book. So I feel it can do better than a ‘normal’ publication. That’s where you come in...



What You Get

A general warning: If we don't reach the goal of 3001 dollars by 10/30 then all you get is your money back in full. No goal= no book. So if you really want your USB and goodies donate and don't wait to tell everyone you know to do the same...


USB Cigarette (13$)-

This USB stick will be custom designed with a cigarette 'look' (and no smoke!). The USB will be preloaded with the book in PDF and various E-reader formats. Beyond the book files, the USB will also contain high-quality image, and video files of all the art work. Also included with be individual MP3 files for each chapter. The reader can choose if and how they want to listen to the soundtrack. Here is the current track-listing:


ch0- video by ?
ch1- a new song by Matt King of ddmmyyyy
ch2- a new song by Freebie
ch3- a new song by Moshe Rozenberg of ddmmyyyy
ch4- a new song by Matthew Doherty
ch5- (three) song(s connected) by the newfound interest in CT.
ch6- a new song by Loom
ch7- a song by Basia Bulat
ch8- a video by Tom Brown


USB T-Shirt (37$ comes with USB)-

The same great design idea as the USB but taken to the next level. It is the opening poem of the book. Here is a very rough mock-up:




Who You're Helping
All of the money you contribute goes towards buying the USBs in bulk, making its contents, and promotion. The base cost is going to be for ordering the USB sticks with the custom ‘cigarette’ design, as well as launching/promoting/running a website where they will be advertised and sold. The second level of costs go towards creating all of the multimedia that will make the USB great. Your money will go directly towards all of the great artists involved in this project. People like this:




Matthew Doherty- is a photographer, musician, and meter reader. He is taking all of the photographs for the book-cover and chapter 6. He is also recording the soundtrack for chapter 4. He currently lives in Galway Ireland.



Ryan Dodgson- is a graduate of the illustration program at the Ontario College of Art and Design. His illustrations will be on the cover as well as in chapter 6. His illustrations have been published in the New York Times and the Believer. He is currently living and working in Toronto, Ontario—across from a chocolate factory.


Matthew King- is a mixed media artist and a musician in the Toronto band dd/mm/yyyy.  He will be soundtracking the first chapter of the novel. He will also be designing and printing all posters and t-shirts. Take a first hand look at how good his previous posters have been.




Tom Brown - is a photographer, and a videographer and editor for the University of Western’s television show. He is currently studying at Western in the Media Info and Tech program. He will be making the video-art for chapter 8. 


Basia Bulat - is the most lovely human being you’ll ever meet in this world. She has toured all over the world, released two lovely albums, and played music for the first dance at my wedding. I am unspeakably thrilled that she has agreed to contribute her talents for the seventh chapter of the novel.



LOOM - is this good. She is on tour,  somewhere in the world as we speak while somehow creating/contributing a song for the sixth chapter. Wow.

More artists to come soon...
And you?
I set my fundraising goal for October 30th because I want to get stuff to YOU by the winter holidays.  Depending on your donation, that might not be all you’ll be receiving in the mail. See the side bar for more info!

<h3> </h3></div>","When watching a work of science fiction on the big or small screen, people of color often find themselves asking:
""Where did we go?""
""Did some melanin-devouring plague attack all humanity?""
""Do zombies only like the dark meat?""
But that's Hollywood. While studio executives continue to show the world's multi-hued population through its monochromatic lens, the literary field of speculative fiction has become more diverse than ever. Whether it's horror, science fiction, or fantasy, steampunk or steamfunk (and let's not forget sword and soul), writers of color are producing quality works and accumulating accolades and awards every day.
Author Bill Campbell (Koontown Killing Kaper, Sunshine Patriots), poet/journalist Edward Austin Hall (the forthcoming Chimera Island), and artist Professor John Jennings (Black Comix, Black Kirby Project) have assembled 40 extraordinarily talented writers who represent just a part of the changing face of speculative fiction.
Mothership: Tales from Afrofuturism is the dynamic, genre-expanding end result.

On the other hand, though, we are a more educated, intelligent and introspective species than we ever have been before. Certainly modern man could find a way to benefit from the powers of the genie.

<p>Reader reviews of <strong>I Dream Analyze Genie</strong></p>
<p>This was a surprisingly good read. ""I Dream Analyze Genie"" is the story of a nebbish man named Jason that relates an incredible story to his disbelieving psychiatrist. He's a very meek fellow that gets used by practically everyone around him... till one day he is given a magic lamp by his mooching neighbor that has borrowed half his stuff and never returned it. Of course, as in most stories involving genies, none of his wishes turn out right. There are some pretty clever twists that keeps the story from being predictable, with a darkly comic ending. The dialogue is sharp and witty. Good stuff.<br/>-Patrick Doran (4 out of 5 stars)<br/><br/>Cleverly written. And liked the take on the genie myth.<br/>-MS (4 out of 5 stars)</p>

<ul>
<li>Our main purpose is to create a major Israeli-Palestinian public negotiating congress with political power that will build momentum for a peacemaking revolution.</li>
<li>The event is designed to demonstrate the peacemaking power of a major Israeli-Palestinian Public Negotiating Congress and create domestic and international support for its establishment.</li>
<li>We have conducted 16 mini public negotiating congresses around the US, Canada and in Israel-Palestine. The time has come to do the event in a public space, that is open and accessible to all, and involve the Israeli and Palestinian people in the struggle for peace.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<p>Bringing Israelis and Palestinians to a negotiating table is extremely challenging, but that is what we do. It is also expensive, and that's where we need your help! We need $2500 to cover expenses. Your contributions will pay for expenses, such as:</p>

<p>The <em>Minds of Peace</em> Organization has successfully led 16 small-scale Israeli-Palestinian public negotiating congresses around the US, Canada, in the West Bank and lately in Israel.

<p> </p></div>","What we do
We are organizing a small-scale Israeli-Palestinian Public Negotiating Congress, at the place where the Israeli social protest began (Rothschild Boulevard, Tel-Aviv) on November 30- December 1, 2012.

Our main purpose is to create a major Israeli-Palestinian public negotiating congress with political power that will build momentum for a peacemaking revolution.
The event is designed to demonstrate the peacemaking power of a major Israeli-Palestinian Public Negotiating Congress and create domestic and international support for its establishment.
We have conducted 16 mini public negotiating congresses around the US, Canada and in Israel-Palestine. The time has come to do the event in a public space, that is open and accessible to all, and involve the Israeli and Palestinian people in the struggle for peace.

What We Need & What You Get
Bringing Israelis and Palestinians to a negotiating table is extremely challenging, but that is what we do. It is also expensive, and that's where we need your help! We need $2500 to cover expenses. Your contributions will pay for expenses, such as:
- Organizing the delegations and getting permissions for Palestinians to enter Israel.
- Renting and installing equipment.
- Paying for travel and accommodation for the Palestinian delegation.
- Filming and webcasting the event.
- Advertising & public relations.
You will become part of our people-to-people peace initiative and help us carry the initiative one step closer to the next step– building a momentum for the creation of a major Israeli-Palestinian public negotiating congress with political power!

<p><em>Over The Moon</em> will be an e-book of outlandish stories--a synthesis of science fiction, humor, and social satire, showcasing a collection of subversive ideas and characters set in the near future when artificial intelligence, virtual reality, data mining, and nanotechnology have become a predominant part of human life. Many of the characters featured in the stories are lowly antiheroes who fight back against intellectually superior corporate machines.</p>
<p>See summaries of the stories further down the page...</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>THE FUNDING</h2>
<p>Why do I need money in order to self-publish? Well, it's more complex than just exporting a PDF and slapping a cover on it. In order to create a compellingly designed e-book that will integrate well into the major publishing platforms like Amazon Kindle and others, I need to invest in a service that will optimize the book's chances of being discovered amidst the tens of thousands of others. These services cost authors a considerable amount of money.</p>
<p>I also plan to commission artwork for the book--orgininal, fantastic, top-quality vector illustrations by brilliant up and coming artists who I will hand pick from Deviant Art and other creative communities. In order to acquire quality art that matches the tone and thematic focus of the stories, I need funding with which to fairly compensate artists for their work.</p>
<p>The more funding I get the further I can go with this project. For example, I would love to transform it into an online graphic novel, with its own interactive website where readers can actually contribute to the storylines and generate their own characters. </p>
<p><em>So here's the breakdown of funds:</em></p>
<p>High-tier self-publishing/marketing service: $1,000-$1,500</p>
<p>Commissioning artwork: $500-$1,000</p>
<p>High-tier CMS for interactive online site: $2,000-$5,000</p>

<h2><strong>THE AUTHOR</strong></h2>
<p>I have been writing my whole life, taking on a variety of genres including creative non-fiction, screenplays, blogs, comedy sketches, and fiction. For the past few years now I've been zeroing in on satirical science fiction, stories that lampoon marketing and sinister corporations while speculating on a strange near future of nanotechnology and artificial intelligence. I want to imbue these stories with subversive humor but also a sincere compassion for humans stuck within the strange machinations of a capitalist empire.</p>
<p>I've worked in a variety of occupations. I've been a production assistant for feature films; a camp counselor; a video editing teacher; a canvasser for an environmental non-profit; and even a guerilla marketer. It's this last job that has inspired the satirical attitude I take toward consumerism and especially the strange world of Web 3.0 that is fast approaching.</p>
<p>I believe science fiction is a genre that has always held the potential for social change, and will continue to figure prominently in the collective social imagination, especially as we adopt increasingly complex technological applications into our lives. I like to remind myself that sci-fi isn't just about aliens in outer space and robots inheriting the Earth--it's also about what's happening right here and now.</p>
<h3>My influences:</h3>
<p>My favorite sci-fi authors are Philip K. Dick, Charles Stross, Gregory Benford, Arther C. Clarke, Corey Doctorow, China Mieville, Alfred Bester, Issac Asimov, William Gibson, John Crowley, Philip Jose Farmer, and many others. There are too many to list here.</p>
<p>I have also been heavily influenced by the ideas and writings of authors, thinkers and publications like Jean Paul Sartre, Andy Warhol, Franz Kafka, Albert Camus, Hunter S. Thompson, Naomi Klein, Michel Foucault, Adbusters, Abbie Hoffman, and activists looking to reclaim the mental environment. </p>

<p align=""LEFT"" style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><span style=""font-family: Times New Roman,serif;""><span style=""font-size: medium;"">One day, in a time very much like your own, there was a young girl waking up in a big city, a metropolis you could say.</span></span></p>
<p align=""LEFT"" style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><span style=""font-family: Times New Roman,serif;""><span style=""font-size: medium;"">She was no ordinary girl, for she was very much like you, and could do extraordinary things. For example, she could braid her hair very quickly, tie her shoes even faster, and knit a whole sweater in a week.</span></span></p>
<p align=""LEFT"" style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><span style=""font-family: Times New Roman,serif;""><span style=""font-size: medium;"">Well, this girl had talents much more than this. She could beat eggs for the fluffiest omelets you ever had, and grip the rope swing so tight she never fell off.</span></span></p>
<p align=""LEFT"" style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><span style=""font-family: Times New Roman,serif;""><span style=""font-size: medium;"">So, this one particular day, waking up in the big city, she put her talents to good use. She ran outside, as she always did on summer days, and crossed the street to the park. She greeted her favorite tree, grabbed its branches, and pulled herself up inside. You may think you cannot be inside a tree, but if you have ever climbed a tree you know what I mean.</span></span></p>
<p align=""LEFT"" style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><span style=""font-family: Times New Roman,serif;""><span style=""font-size: medium;"">Inside the tree, sitting on the sturdiest branch, she noticed a new bird’s nest on a higher branch.</span></span></p>
<p align=""LEFT"" style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">“<span style=""font-family: Times New Roman,serif;""><span style=""font-size: medium;"">That’s funny” she thought to herself, “that wasn’t there yesterday.”</span></span></p>
<p align=""LEFT"" style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><span style=""font-family: Times New Roman,serif;""><span style=""font-size: medium;"">She realized the bird who built it must work very fast, to build a nest in one night.

The lead characters embody these things by the end of their stories, finding it within themselves. I believe that it is important for children to learn and know they make a unique and valuable contribution to the world when they are expressing themselves and using their natural talents. Obsidian aims to help them do that in a fun, adventurous way. Can you remember a childhood book that made you feel good about your unique self?
My teen-age son, Alex, is an aspiring artist and when I asked if he would draw some illustrations for the book he was excited! He intends to go to art school and this will be an important experience for him to see that he can get his art out into the world. We already have our next book outlined for release in 2014! Alex said: “It's important to me because I want people to see that not only adults can be (professional) artists, but kids can be too.”
Obsidian is complete and ready to publish! I only need to add a contributor's page from this campaign. Writing and publishing this book were easy compared to the task of getting out into the world and into the hands of children. Big publishing houses have allotted budgets for marketing and promotion, where most self-publishers - including me - do not, and that's where you can help.
By contributing to this campaign, you’ll be helping us give this book to children who otherwise may not have found it and it's message of inspiration and encouragement. Almost all of the perks include books donated directly to kids. You get books, kids get books, we get the word out about Obsidian to get more books to more kids - it's a win-win-win for everyone! How could it get any better than that? 
I've gotten wonderful feedback from all those who have read it so far!
From the back cover of the book:

<h3>Name Change: The name of the book has been changed from ""A Puncher's Chance"" to ""A Fighter's Chance""</h3>

<h3>Congratulations to Chad Synder from Maryland on winning the Reyes Boxing Gloves!                              </h3>
<h2> </h2>
<h2> </h2>
<h2>                                WELCOME!!!</h2>
<p>Hello, Welcome to my Indiegogo campaign. If you clicked on the link to fightnights.com please look at the perk rewards on how to get into the drawing to win the Reyes boxing gloves along with some other cool rewards for higher donations!</p>
<p>A Fighter's Chance will be the second novel that I have written. It's the story of a boy that stumbles across a boxing gym as a child and grows up to become a serious contender. He will face many challenges along the way. He develops a close bond with his trainer who is determined to test him every way he can. The young boy struggles with hatred for his parents, living with no money, and a corrupt political boxing world that does nothing short of pushing fighters towards the brink of failure. With the help of his Coach, and a few straggling friends, he must learn to overcome all his obstacles and fight his way through the ranks to a title shot. His most important lesson of all, is that in order to win the championship inside of the ring, he must learn to destroy his demons outside of it.</p>
<h2>                   </h2>
<h2>                        WHAT'S IN IT FOR YOU?</h2>
<p>Other than some pretty awesome rewards for your donations I've decided to use this book to give back to a sport that I fell in love with growing up. Once the book gets published I am going to donate 20% of all the profits to pay for boxing gloves and gear to the less fortunate kids that sign up at local boxing gyms in the area. For the gyms that charge fees, I will be paying for thier gym fees. Most kids that take up the sport of Boxing don't have the money to pay for nice things. I intend to give it to them. So your donations will not only help me with the release of this book, but you will be helping give back to my community. Something else that I plan to do, is that if I raise enough money I will travel to my grandmother's home in Nochistlan, ZA, Mexico, and buy boxing bags, gloves, and wraps for a gym that has recently opened there. The gym currently has one bag and a few pairs of torn up old gloves. Sad, I know. My goal is to change that! Also, a 30$ donation does get you a free book that is signed by me, so you can look at it as just buying a signed book for 30$. Not a bad deal!</p>

<h2>                                 About Me</h2>
<p> </p>
<p>If you asked ten different people what they thought about me you would most likely get ten different answers. What will be the same though, is that they would all say that I am fun person to be around. I enjoy every moment of my life no matter what I am doing. I believe that life is too short to be angry. Yes, life presents its challenges, and there are hard times for us all. However, we all get through them. We learn to live with the cards that we've been dealt. I do it with a smile on my face. The bond between people is what makes the world tick. I believe in God, although seldom do I find my way to church like I am supposed to. My parents are sweet. I have a big family with two brothers and two sisters, who have given me my fair share of headaches over the years, and dozens of cousins that have scattered themselves all over the world.</p>
<p>I love sports! Saturday mornings you can find me playing football somewhere in Western New York. The sport has caused more than a few serious injuries for me. I have a serious addiction to Iphone apps. I'm convinced that one day there will be professional counseling for it, in which I will gladly attend. I like hanging out with my girlfriend and crazy dog. Meeting new people is fun and exciting. Working out is a must for me at least four days a week, and considering that fact that I eat everything that I lay my eyes on, hitting the gym is a habit I need to keep. I like to travel, hike, and am always thrilled to try something new and exciting. I live life one day at a time and wouldn't have it any other way. </p>

<h2>                               Why boxing?</h2>
<p>When I was fifteen years old me and my friend were paid to clean out the upstairs of a building. The reason for this was because a boxing gym was going to rent it out. Now I was no tough guy, in fact I didn't like fighting. Yet, my interest could not be swayed. When the gym moved in I signed up to see how it was, and never looked back. I loved it! Boxing taught me to me self-confident, disciplined, and patient. These characteristics didn't just bind themselves within the ropes. They translated into my life as well. The sport changed my life. Fifteen years later I still go three days a week and help train fighters alongside my beloved Coach. I have seen many kids walk in and out of that gym with so many different stories. While my novel is fictional, it sums up what all young fighters go through trying to make it in the boxing world. What I have seen in boxing has inspired me to write this story.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>               Quotes from ""A Fighter's Chance""</h2>
<p> </p>
<p>""Often, a man of few words has more to say than a man of many.""</p>
<p>""A man's heart cannot be defined in times of prosperity and riches, but in times of darkness and despair.""</p>
<p>""My father was gone at the age of six and my mother became a crack addict when I was seven. I can't afford my rent, my bills, nor do I have any idea where my next meal is going to come from. If there is a man with more anger in his heart than me, I would love to meet him.""</p>
<p>""Boxing is a sport that demands your full attention. It must be your life. You must live it, you must sleep it, you must breathe it. The very thought of existing outside of the ring cannot exist.""</p>
<p>""Do not hold on to anger or hatred for the people you love. When you get mad, get over it. When you get angry, relax. When you don't want to talk to someone for whatever reason you have, walk up to them and work it out. One day you will wake up, tomorrow or twenty years from now, and it will seem like a normal day. You will go to work, go to the gym, clean the house, whatever it is that you do. Somewhere in that day, you will get a phone call or text, and someone that you love will have died. A brother, sister, mother, father, child, aunt, uncle, whoever it may be. If your heart is filled with malice and hatred, then you will regret it. But if it is filled with love and compassion, you will never regret anything you say and do to people. Each memory will be a great one. You will remember the good, because you chose to destroy the bad.""</p>
<p>""I don't know if I can win this fight. Hell I don't know if I'll ever be the champ that everyone expects me to be, but what I do know, is that I'm willing to die in that ring for it, and that has to count for something.""</p>

<h2> </h2>
<p class=""Standard""> </p>
<p class=""Standard"">The sound of the bell jars my thoughts as I make my way to the corner of the ring. I place my arms on the ropes and wait as Trey positions the stool. The look in his brown eyes is confident as he slips his lithe body between the ropes without touching them.</p>
<p class=""Standard"">My white gloves are pasted with spots of dried-up blood. Taking deep breaths hurts my lungs. It feels as though a 400-pound man is dancing on my chest. My body is covered in so much sweat it looks like I’ve just gotten out of a pool. </p>
<p class=""Standard"">The last four rounds have been a war. Taking a seat on the hard stool, I realize how tired my legs are. It's been a long fight. I think it's round eleven but I'm not entirely sure. The pain in my head is like a nagging headache that never goes away. My right eye is swelled up, although my vision is clear. I can feel the electricity of the crowd and it makes me realize one thing: this has been one hell of a fight!</p>
<p class=""Standard"">Trey covers my back with a bag of ice, making me jump, and the soothing cold spreading across my back helps me regain focus. Henry Brass joins Trey in aid. Mr. Brass’ gray, healthy hair and clean-shaven face look rich. Not nearly as rich as his pockets though. Mr. Brass smiles at me. He was one of the reasons why I was here.</p>
<p class=""Standard"">His daughter sits a few seats over in the front row. With bright green eyes that can be noticed from where I sit I can’t help but take a peek over. Her blonde hair looks amazing with her black dress. She’s the most beautiful girl in this arena, at least in my eyes. She’s not showing her usually stunning smile; instead, she looks worried.</p>
<p class=""Standard"">Coach Kay is talking to me. I can hear what he is saying but somehow I ignore it. It is the eleventh round, that much is clear.</p>
<p class=""Standard"">I can't help but look out into the vast crowd; it’s the biggest I’ve ever seen. People are screaming, and many of them are looking at me. I can only hear them in between rounds, for when the fight in the ring starts, everything goes blank.</p>
<p class=""Standard"">The arena fits at least 70,000 people. According to the promoters, every single seat has been paid for. I glance at promoter Grey Bones and distaste swells in my mouth. I wish it was him on the other side of that ring so I could pound his face in as soon as the round starts again. The hair around his head is mostly gray with streaks of black that refuse to give way to his age. He’s a tall man that perhaps kept in shape in his younger years. The man has more money than God, and more deceit in his eyes than Satan himself. Boxing is his gold mine. Everything he’s done, everything he has tried to do, and everything he plans on doing in this sport bothers me. There is only one way to beat him, and that is to beat the man across from me right now. That victory would shatter Bones’ world.</p>
<p class=""Standard"">Juan Riviera is sitting a few seats away. Dressed in a dove-gray suit made precisely to his liking, the once boxing sensation is looking at me with worried eyes. Many compare me to him, saying that my good looks and boxing abilities are everything the sport needed after Riviera retired. Even though his black hair and dark brown eyes are the complete opposite of mine, I can’t help but see the similarities between us.</p>
<p class=""Standard"">Disputes often broke when speaking Juan Riviera’s name. He used to be the face of boxing and the people loved him. However, a stunning knockout loss sent him to retirement so early in his career that many debated whether he was worthy of entering the Hall of Fame. He hadn't let retirement ruin his good looks, and he seemed like he could still get in the ring and go a few rounds. Juan was looking for me to take his place as a superstar in the sport. But I still don't trust him fully. Perhaps I never will. Promoters are very hard to trust, and even harder to become friends with. Still, if Juan released me tomorrow, I would walk over and hug him, thanking him for everything he’s done.</p>
<p class=""Standard"">I’m not sure if I’m losing or winning the fight, it's been so close. Judging by Juan’s eyes, though, I am losing. The fact that it’s been this close has surprised everyone, I’m sure.</p>
<p class=""Standard"">“Look at me, son!”</p>
<p class=""Standard"">Coach Kay finally gets my attention. He has the most distinct, demanding tone I have ever heard. I look into his strong and determined eyes. His black skin shines in the lights that hover above the ring. His tall body always seems smaller when he is hunched over, cleaning me up. Taking the end-swell, he rubs my eyes as he grabs the towel and wipes the sweat from my face. I feel like smiling at the old man but I can’t. If Mr. Brass saved my life, then Coach Kay changed it. The man has been everything I could ask for in a trainer, and perhaps even a father. We have been through it all, Coach and I. It hasn’t been an easy road but is it ever? The hardest part is yet to come. He will tell the world our secret after this fight. The secret that I have fought so hard to keep buried inside of me, the secret that will change my life forever. I realize I have to quickly dismiss that thought, though. If I let it distract me, I will surely lose this fight.</p>
<p class=""Standard"">“He's tired, you understand me?” Coach barks. “He's damn tired! If you win these last two rounds, you will win this fight! Do you understand me? I need you to go after him now. These are the championship rounds, son. This is what we train for. Take the fight to him!”</p>
<p class=""Standard"">The words ring through my head. I'm winning? Or am I losing and I need the last two rounds to win the fight? I would never ask. My face is all over the television and I wouldn't want their corner to see any doubt in my eyes. Each round has been close. I know that I won a few rounds in the middle, and I know of some rounds I lost, but they go by so fast I can't count how many. The close rounds are hard to judge because, as a fighter, I can never tell if I won or lost the round unless I completely dominate. Even then you never know what these judges are thinking especially if one of them is corrupt or just plain stupid.</p>
<p class=""Standard"">Looking across the ring, I stare into the eyes of my opponent for a moment. His face is swollen and his right eye is cut. He's breathing heavy. I have watched hundreds of tapes of him and have never seen him breathing the way he is right now. He has never been cut. The most distinguishing thing, though, is the look in his eyes. He’s usually confident, cocky, and poised, but he’s none of those right now. For the first time ever, I see fear in his eyes. He's worried. He's tired. Coach Kay is right. I can win this fight! It was a fight very few people thought I could win.</p>
<p class=""Standard"">He glances at me and I look away. I take a few deep breaths. My legs don't hurt now as much as before. I can't tell if my mind has tuned the pain out or if the one-minute break between the round has helped. It might be the fear in his eyes that has given me the energy to continue.</p>
<p class=""Standard"">Standing up, I can hear the crowd going crazy. I've ignored all of the celebrities sitting ringside. It’s my first fight they’ve attended, but I know they’re not here to see me. They paid a ridiculous amount of money to come watch Dominick as they usually do. Money was something that I once hated more than anything, something that nearly drove me to end my boxing career, and almost my life.</p>
<p class=""Standard"">Tonight, I have to steal his spotlight. I have to take his crown. I have to show the world that the pain they have seen in my life the last couple weeks has made me stronger than I’ve ever been. My story has spread quickly; so tonight, despite being the underdog, I am the crowd favorite. I may never know if it’s because they feel sorry for what I’ve been through or if they truly like me. Regardless, people who didn’t even know my name weeks ago now want me to win.</p>
<p class=""Standard"">I take one last look into the arena. A faded image of my father appears in the middle of the crowd. I can’t deny that I look like him: dirty blonde hair, light green eyes, and a smile that could steal any woman’s heart. His tall, muscular figure towers over everyone around him. He is not cheering, just smiling at me like he used too. There is only one thing I once hated more than money, and it is him.</p>
<p class=""Standard"">A second later, the image of my father is gone and I see my mother. I almost laugh. I must be delusional after one too many punches to the head. How could one image that I hated lead into another? They say you should always forgive but not forget, but what she did to me I can never forgive. Every single time I stare into that woman’s eyes, the hatred in my soul burns.</p>
<p class=""Standard"">Then I remember that I had invited her to come. And I suddenly realize that my mother is actually in the crowd, sitting timidly a few rows back from the ring. Her being here, I tell myself, is a small step toward making amends for the devastation she brought upon my family.</p>
<p class=""Standard"">The bell rings. It’s the eleventh round of the championship fight, a fight that the whole world is watching. I have come to love this sport more than anything, but it was pain that started me on the journey to her here...</p>

</div></div>","A fighters chance will be released next week. I should have everyones copies by June 1st. Thank you for all the support!
 
 
Name Change: The name of the book has been changed from ""A Puncher's Chance"" to ""A Fighter's Chance""
 
Congratulations to Chad Synder from Maryland on winning the Reyes Boxing Gloves!                              
 
 
                                WELCOME!!!
Hello, Welcome to my Indiegogo campaign. If you clicked on the link to fightnights.com please look at the perk rewards on how to get into the drawing to win the Reyes boxing gloves along with some other cool rewards for higher donations!
A Fighter's Chance will be the second novel that I have written. It's the story of a boy that stumbles across a boxing gym as a child and grows up to become a serious contender. He will face many challenges along the way. He develops a close bond with his trainer who is determined to test him every way he can. The young boy struggles with hatred for his parents, living with no money, and a corrupt political boxing world that does nothing short of pushing fighters towards the brink of failure. With the help of his Coach, and a few straggling friends, he must learn to overcome all his obstacles and fight his way through the ranks to a title shot. His most important lesson of all, is that in order to win the championship inside of the ring, he must learn to destroy his demons outside of it.
                   
                        WHAT'S IN IT FOR YOU?
Other than some pretty awesome rewards for your donations I've decided to use this book to give back to a sport that I fell in love with growing up. Once the book gets published I am going to donate 20% of all the profits to pay for boxing gloves and gear to the less fortunate kids that sign up at local boxing gyms in the area. For the gyms that charge fees, I will be paying for thier gym fees. Most kids that take up the sport of Boxing don't have the money to pay for nice things. I intend to give it to them. So your donations will not only help me with the release of this book, but you will be helping give back to my community. Something else that I plan to do, is that if I raise enough money I will travel to my grandmother's home in Nochistlan, ZA, Mexico, and buy boxing bags, gloves, and wraps for a gym that has recently opened there. The gym currently has one bag and a few pairs of torn up old gloves. Sad, I know. My goal is to change that! Also, a 30$ donation does get you a free book that is signed by me, so you can look at it as just buying a signed book for 30$. Not a bad deal!

I have a big family with two brothers and two sisters, who have given me my fair share of headaches over the years, and dozens of cousins that have scattered themselves all over the world.
I love sports! Saturday mornings you can find me playing football somewhere in Western New York. The sport has caused more than a few serious injuries for me. I have a serious addiction to Iphone apps. I'm convinced that one day there will be professional counseling for it, in which I will gladly attend. I like hanging out with my girlfriend and crazy dog. Meeting new people is fun and exciting. Working out is a must for me at least four days a week, and considering that fact that I eat everything that I lay my eyes on, hitting the gym is a habit I need to keep.

<p><strong>WHY?</strong></p>
<p>The idea for News Bubble came after my wife was in our local town centre and saw a lot of police and an air ambulance. After arriving home she went online to find out what had been going on, but to her frustration she could not find any report of the incident on any online news source. She eventually found a report on Twitter telling of a stabbing in the area. My wife and I observed that the internet lacked a news service that provides news quickly, particularly at a local level, noting that although the information was eventually found on Twitter, she had to search for it rather than having it presented to her and that it was reported by a member of the public.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>WHAT?</strong></p>
<p>News Bubble’s purpose is to provide a worldwide online platform for the general public to publish news articles as they see them happening and have that news pushed into the public domain via the News Bubble website. Importantly the content will be sorted according to taxonomy and ranked by the amount of views and ratings the news item attains. The aim is to provide online news quickly, uncensored and ordered to the readers interests.</p>
<p>We are at an amazing moment in history, 92% of adults in the UK have mobile phones. As of September 2012, 39% of adults in the UK are using smartphones. News Bubble is perfectly poised to revolutionise the way we consume news. </p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>HOW?</strong></p>
<p>News Bubble will consists of a website and mobile phone applications.  The mobile apps allows the user to report on a story as it happens or at a later time, adding a location, headline, category, pictures, video and text for their article. This article is then sent to the website where it is made available to read within its category page. Each story on the site will then have the opportunity to move further to the forefront of the site (the front page being the top level) based on how many times that story is read and rated in relation to the other stories on the site.  Anyone can read the articles on the site, but only registered users may post, rate and comment on stories. Registered users can also create their own front page, displaying only the news categories they are interested in and will be able to follow other users whose stories and comments they like or dislike.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>GOAL?</strong></p>
<p>To publish the news as it is breaking.</p>
<p>Every person alive who has access to a phone or a computer can report the news.</p>
<p>Give every person who publishes a story the opportunity to reach the front page.</p>
<p>Let the public decide what stories are important and where they need to be seen on the site.</p>
<p>Keep the news uncensored and unbiased.</p>
<p>The news is some of the most important information we absorb in our day to day lives and with the growing need for online news and people’s desire to participate in social networking we feel News Bubble is perfectly placed to capitalise on both these growing sectors.  We believe that as the site grows and matures so will its content, creating a new genre of news distribution, changing the way that news is reported and consumed.</p>
<p>All these goals are designed to set News Bubble apart from any other news outlet, turning the world in to an online news community.</p>
<p>By being available to every person alive, News Bubble effectively has 6 billion reporters stationed on every corner of the planet. </p>

As always, I had a pile of things to do, but instead, I felt the urge to create something new. I began sketching a girl and, at the time, I didn’t think much of it, but that girl would later become the leader of a group of extraordinary women. “Galactic Purple” was the first magical girl I created, and soon, three others joined her: “Cosmic Green,” “Radical Rainbow,” and “Prism Pink.” I also created one more character, a goddess only known as, “Heavenly Universe,"" who would end up becoming the logo to a series I hadn't been planning on writing AT ALL!</p><p>At the time, none of the characters had names beyond their magical girl titles. They didn’t have personalities, back stories, likes, dislikes… they were blank slates. But, over time, each girl developed into a character. More importantly, the girls came together as a team, and I began putting together an outline for a book series. Each book will explore each of the girls and their relationships with one another, along with their interactions with others — both in their magical lives and everyday ones.</p><h3> </h3><h3><strong>The Creator</strong></h3><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1485379416/jwomrms5df8kbmizmii3.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>Hi there! I'm Briana Lawrence, also known as ""Brichibi Cosplays."" I'm a freelance writer who goes from writing scripts for WatchMojo.com to creating fantastical worlds where queer black girls save the day with magical cupcakes and rainbow powered kicks! I'm often traveling the country with my work and my cosplay, doing panels on the importance of diversity and self love. I've been writing since I was nine years old and even have a B.A. in English and Women's Studies from Iowa State University. I also dabble around with a woodburner from time to time, which is actually how this whole magical girl adventure started!</p><p>I hope you take a moment to check out my work. This is going to be the first book in the series I'm planning. I'm hoping to have some fun, queer, carefree black girl representation... and sparkles. Lots of sparkles. </p><h3> </h3><h3><strong>The Journey</strong></h3><p>Since March 2016, I've been travelling to numerous conventions to spread the word about the book series. I've done this by having prints, crafts, preview books, and buttons of the girls at my art table.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1485462587/fgcyar47iz3b6qn1m9ws.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>Because of my convention travels and my constant promotion of the girls, I've already begun to create a fan base for them, and many are anxious to read their story!</p><h3> </h3><h3><strong>The Story</strong></h3><p>There’s a city. It’s like most other cities. Buildings. People. Monsters who can destroy sidewalks by vomiting acid onto the ground, and an elite group of black, queer, magical girls who work to put those monsters in their place.</p><p>See? Just like most other cities.</p><p>Bree Danvers would’ve compared it to a video game, maybe a cartoon or comic book, except black girls are rarely the heroines of the story. But there her heroine stood, plus size and wonderful, rocking a dazzling amount of purple and defeating monsters with galactic sparkles. Galactic Purple, that was her name, and soon, Bree was joining her on a magical adventure full of transformations and after school battles to defend a city like most other cities.</p><p>And soon, others would join them, and each one would be magical in their own way… give or take a few bumps on the acid covered ground.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1485446646/ygwdgds7jnvfsw9tslyf.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p> </p><h3>The Campaign</h3><p>Now it's time to get down to the glitter and sparkles. <i>magnifique</i>NOIR is going to be a mix of creativity. The first book, ""I Am Magical,"" will not only be a full-length novel written by me, but it'll also feature a variety of art to represent some of the key moments in the story. This art will be done by myself and an amazing group of artists who have teamed up with me to tell this story, for example, this piece by ""<a href=""https://www.facebook.com/Artbydavethewave/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">The Art of Dave Branch</a>"" where Lonnie takes on a monster:</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1485459218/svwfu3ng7rwy9nyc0ex4.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>The art will be in black and white, however, if the campaign exceeds the initial goal, I plan on looking into upgrading the book with full colored illustrations.

Also, if the campaign exceeds the initial goal and I'm able to look into creating more merchandise for the girls, everyone who pledged will get a discount code for my online store so they can get these brand new perks at a lower price!

</ul><p> </p><h3>Reaching Beyond the Stars</h3><p>So let's say the Indiegogo is SO successful that we go beyond the initial goal. Beyond looking into having the pictures in the book be fully colored, here are a few things I have planned for the future:</p><p><strong>1. MORE ART</strong></p><p>I'd love to feature even more art in the book and offer new pieces as prints. Here's an example of what's to come from the lovely <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/SakuraMochiPandaArt/?fref=ts"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Sakura Mochi Panda</a>:</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1485520510/fzjfk6dc0uyxmqmvaln8.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><strong>2. COMIC BOOKS</strong></p><p>I actually have TWO ideas for potential comics. One would be a fun series of one-shot tales of the girls everyday lives. This includes monster battles, fandoms, crushes, and other trials and tribulations that they face. These little comics would be illustrated by me! Originally, I was going to include them in the novel, but after giving it some thought I felt that it would make the book feel a bit too cluttered. So instead, I want to have individual issues of these little comics. Here's an example of a story that would be told:</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1485526015/u7jvetqzrpkl83o032zl.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>The second comic book idea would be a more serious story. It would serve as a prequel of sorts and tell the story of how Marianna became Galactic Purple: the leader of <i>magnifique</i>NOIR. I would collaborate with an artist and write the script for the comic while they illustrated the tale.</p><p><strong>3. ART BOOK</strong></p><p>I ADORE art books and have several from my favorite series. I would love to have a book full of the art that spans through the <i>magnifique</i>NOIR universe. The book would include art from the various artists working on the project, concept sketches of the main characters, and concept sketches of some of the side characters you meet along the way. </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1485526234/mitwlnqeluvmgnmrvjtw.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1485526252/ptmv849wmmsml1zoskyj.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><strong>4. COLORING BOOK</strong></p><p>Since I already have coloring pages that I've done of the girls, I want to do more pages and turn them all into a coloring book. This would let you color in your favorite magical girl, and may include an encouraging word or two to remind you of how magical you are.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1485526338/mlvk34yhlbdf7kiennq0.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><strong>5. MORE CRAFTS</strong></p><p>This is sort of a general goal of wanting to make more unique merchandise of the <i>magnifique</i>NOIR brand. This would include things like plushies, pillows, charms, bags (make up and/or pencil), and other things that I will have available at conventions and on the website.</p><ul><li><strong>Bag Mock Up:</strong></li></ul><p><strong>​<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1485526629/emlvrnpuzaagiaf2lue7.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></strong></p><p>These are just five examples of what the future potentially holds for <i>magnifique</i>NOIR. There are other things I plan on looking into such as bath products and even clothing that represents the <i>magnifique</i>NOIR brand! Let's see how far we can take these girls!</p><p><strong>#magnifiqueNOIR </strong>when sharing and discussing online!</p><ul>

</ul><p> </p><h3>Risks and challenges</h3><p>There are a great number of risks when it comes to self publishing. Beyond the lingering stigma, there’s a chance that this book series could be overlooked. There’s a chance that it won’t sell to anyone beyond this month long project and it’ll be left in the back of my closet. There’s a chance that I won’t get into all the conventions I’ve tried for, which would limit the amount of promotion I want to do.</p><p>On a more personal note, while there is support for queer voices of color, there are a lot of people who may not give this project a chance simply because of the race and sexual orientation of not just the lead characters, but of myself. That’s something I have to face as a black, queer writer, but if nothing else, it’s taught me to be persistent.</p><p>I’ve been going to conventions across the country with my work, giving panels on diversity, and working to make myself a person who stands out -- and I aim to make that shine through with my work. I plan to have a major focus on this series -- not just as a book, but as a brand.

As always, I had a pile of things to do, but instead, I felt the urge to create something new. I began sketching a girl and, at the time, I didn’t think much of it, but that girl would later become the leader of a group of extraordinary women. “Galactic Purple” was the first magical girl I created, and soon, three others joined her: “Cosmic Green,” “Radical Rainbow,” and “Prism Pink.” I also created one more character, a goddess only known as, “Heavenly Universe,"" who would end up becoming the logo to a series I hadn't been planning on writing AT ALL!At the time, none of the characters had names beyond their magical girl titles. They didn’t have personalities, back stories, likes, dislikes… they were blank slates. But, over time, each girl developed into a character. More importantly, the girls came together as a team, and I began putting together an outline for a book series. Each book will explore each of the girls and their relationships with one another, along with their interactions with others — both in their magical lives and everyday ones. The CreatorHi there! I'm Briana Lawrence, also known as ""Brichibi Cosplays."" I'm a freelance writer who goes from writing scripts for WatchMojo.com to creating fantastical worlds where queer black girls save the day with magical cupcakes and rainbow powered kicks! I'm often traveling the country with my work and my cosplay, doing panels on the importance of diversity and self love. I've been writing since I was nine years old and even have a B.A. in English and Women's Studies from Iowa State University. I also dabble around with a woodburner from time to time, which is actually how this whole magical girl adventure started!I hope you take a moment to check out my work. This is going to be the first book in the series I'm planning. I'm hoping to have some fun, queer, carefree black girl representation... and sparkles. Lots of sparkles.  The JourneySince March 2016, I've been travelling to numerous conventions to spread the word about the book series. I've done this by having prints, crafts, preview books, and buttons of the girls at my art table.Because of my convention travels and my constant promotion of the girls, I've already begun to create a fan base for them, and many are anxious to read their story! The StoryThere’s a city. It’s like most other cities. Buildings. People. Monsters who can destroy sidewalks by vomiting acid onto the ground, and an elite group of black, queer, magical girls who work to put those monsters in their place.See? Just like most other cities.Bree Danvers would’ve compared it to a video game, maybe a cartoon or comic book, except black girls are rarely the heroines of the story. But there her heroine stood, plus size and wonderful, rocking a dazzling amount of purple and defeating monsters with galactic sparkles. Galactic Purple, that was her name, and soon, Bree was joining her on a magical adventure full of transformations and after school battles to defend a city like most other cities.And soon, others would join them, and each one would be magical in their own way… give or take a few bumps on the acid covered ground. The CampaignNow it's time to get down to the glitter and sparkles. magnifiqueNOIR is going to be a mix of creativity. The first book, ""I Am Magical,"" will not only be a full-length novel written by me, but it'll also feature a variety of art to represent some of the key moments in the story. This art will be done by myself and an amazing group of artists who have teamed up with me to tell this story, for example, this piece by ""The Art of Dave Branch"" where Lonnie takes on a monster:The art will be in black and white, however, if the campaign exceeds the initial goal, I plan on looking into upgrading the book with full colored illustrations. That means that pieces like this collaborative battle scene by ""MuseTap Studios"" and ""Radiant Grey"" will be in color as a print AND in the book itself: Costs ItemsRight off the bat, anyone pledging anything, whether it's a perk or just money in general, will receive a coloring page at the end of the campaign. The page features the ladies cosplaying, which is a big part of my life:Everyone will also have their names posted in the ""Thank You"" section of the magnifiqueNOIR website once the campaign is over! Also, if the campaign exceeds the initial goal and I'm able to look into creating more merchandise for the girls, everyone who pledged will get a discount code for my online store so they can get these brand new perks at a lower price! I will keep in touch with all backers to let them know if/when that happens.As you explore the perks, you'll see that each one comes with various items, and you can check out those items in full detail below:Sizes:Prints A and M = 11 x 17*Photo A will be 4 x 6 for the perk ""Not Ready for a Commitment Yet""Prints B, E, F, I - L, O = 8.5 X 11*other sizes will be updated once I get confirmation from the artistsHere is a sketch of what Print D will look like: What is a Hug Me Hero?Hug Me Heroes are soft and cuddly friends that you can add to your collection or snuggle with whenever the mood suits you. They are similar to teddy bears, only they look like your favorite characters. In this case, they will look like the ladies of magnifiqueNOIR! Since they are handmade, there will be a very limited number of them. This picture shows a sketch of what one will look like, along with an example of a finished Hug Me Hero.What will the pillows look like?There will be sketches of the planned pillows soon, but they generally come out looking like this: The Incredible ArtistsWonder who's behind all the art you've been seeing? Here is a nifty little list! These are just the artists who have produced art for the series so far, so the list is subject to change as more artists are added to the roster. Keep in mind, the more funding we get, the more art we can acquire for the book and for prints!

MuseTap Studios - Print A and M  

NamiOki - Print B and C  

Radiant Grey - Print M  

Berry Blitz Studio - Print D and O  
The Art of Dave Branch - The black and white image of Lonnie facing a monster
Graphite Punch Illustration - Print N  

Cosmicheroart - The postcard set


Nozomi Neko - Button Set 2  
 Reaching Beyond the StarsSo let's say the Indiegogo is SO successful that we go beyond the initial goal. Beyond looking into having the pictures in the book be fully colored, here are a few things I have planned for the future:1. MORE ARTI'd love to feature even more art in the book and offer new pieces as prints. Here's an example of what's to come from the lovely Sakura Mochi Panda:2. COMIC BOOKSI actually have TWO ideas for potential comics. One would be a fun series of one-shot tales of the girls everyday lives. This includes monster battles, fandoms, crushes, and other trials and tribulations that they face. These little comics would be illustrated by me! Originally, I was going to include them in the novel, but after giving it some thought I felt that it would make the book feel a bit too cluttered. So instead, I want to have individual issues of these little comics. Here's an example of a story that would be told:The second comic book idea would be a more serious story. It would serve as a prequel of sorts and tell the story of how Marianna became Galactic Purple: the leader of magnifiqueNOIR. I would collaborate with an artist and write the script for the comic while they illustrated the tale.3. ART BOOKI ADORE art books and have several from my favorite series. I would love to have a book full of the art that spans through the magnifiqueNOIR universe. The book would include art from the various artists working on the project, concept sketches of the main characters, and concept sketches of some of the side characters you meet along the way. 4. COLORING BOOKSince I already have coloring pages that I've done of the girls, I want to do more pages and turn them all into a coloring book. This would let you color in your favorite magical girl, and may include an encouraging word or two to remind you of how magical you are.5. MORE CRAFTSThis is sort of a general goal of wanting to make more unique merchandise of the magnifiqueNOIR brand. This would include things like plushies, pillows, charms, bags (make up and/or pencil), and other things that I will have available at conventions and on the website.Bag Mock Up:​These are just five examples of what the future potentially holds for magnifiqueNOIR. There are other things I plan on looking into such as bath products and even clothing that represents the magnifiqueNOIR brand! Let's see how far we can take these girls!#magnifiqueNOIR when sharing and discussing online!

 Risks and challengesThere are a great number of risks when it comes to self publishing. Beyond the lingering stigma, there’s a chance that this book series could be overlooked. There’s a chance that it won’t sell to anyone beyond this month long project and it’ll be left in the back of my closet. There’s a chance that I won’t get into all the conventions I’ve tried for, which would limit the amount of promotion I want to do.On a more personal note, while there is support for queer voices of color, there are a lot of people who may not give this project a chance simply because of the race and sexual orientation of not just the lead characters, but of myself. That’s something I have to face as a black, queer writer, but if nothing else, it’s taught me to be persistent.I’ve been going to conventions across the country with my work, giving panels on diversity, and working to make myself a person who stands out -- and I aim to make that shine through with my work. I plan to have a major focus on this series -- not just as a book, but as a brand. I plan on having books along with expanded merchandise of the ladies, moving beyond just printed and paper items.I'm already well into planning my convention season for 2017. I am confirmed for some already, as either an artist with a table or a guest, and the registration period for several others will open up soon. Given my track record of selling at conventions and how many there are, I have no doubt my schedule will be full before I know it. I already know that I have an audience that I've built up over the last few years with conventions and my social media presence and I've had success with my previous novel sales at each convention. Currently, the book is being editing, as the first draft was finished before the launch of this campaign.

<h3>Story of My Book</h3>
<strong><i>Frameworks for Impact fellows summarizes on how nation can be built bottom up taking the advantage of technological revolutions. It helps to create platform of social entrepreneurs for the experts of various industries who are committed to build sustainable societies to direct their creative thinking. I am connecting dots to start my own government consulting company 5 years down the time line to build small but self sufficient and sustainable communities.</i></strong><br/><br/>My name is Ramakrishna Doppalapoodi and I am the author of Frameworks for Impact fellows. I wrote it because with the knowledge I gained over the years I spent in understanding what strategies corporate companies adopt in solving their problems good at to propose innovative technology driven solution to help people who want to create positive impact on the world and explain ways to get past the bureaucratic leadership that is crippling the ability to solve the social problems.<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover importance of understanding the social context of culture and history rather than just imitating the economic development models of different countries. In this book, I hope to instill the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for smart communities. Smart communities make tactical use of Industry 4.0 technologies to help decentralize the economy so that more importance is given to the efficient use of local resources and innovation without having to rely on high investments in infrastructure development. And then ultimately I want you to see this book as a tool to use various frameworks to contribute to the institutional development to build sustainable communities, considering the notion that sustainability and happiness have to be quantified.<br/><br/>In this book, you'll learn why is emotional investment is important in building nation, how internalizing the concept of social enterprise is more important to interest groups, civic organizations, businesses and governments, and how ancient war strategies are relevant in solving complex problems even today and help us in building smart societies, towns, municipalities, or cities:<ul>
<li>
<strong>Ancient India and effect of invasions on India</strong>: Beginning from Alexander's invasion in 326 BC, crossing the river Indus he advanced towards Taxila, till British left India in 1948, India was under constant invasion. Renowned economist Utsa Patnaik in her research “Agrarian and Other Histories” mentions that over roughly 200 years, the East India Company and the British Raj siphoned out at least $45 trillion from India. But what was lost is more than wealth, wisdom. But fortunately there are still nuggets of wisdom intricated in the Indian culture and it is wise to glean that wisdom without having to reinvent the wheel.</li>
<li>
<strong>Is democracy a disaster</strong>: On June 26, 1975, Indira Gandhi persuaded President of India Fakhruddin Ali Ahmed to declare a national emergency, which empowered her to do whatever she considered best for the country for at least six month. Gandhi announced her Twenty-Point Program soon after the emergency was proclaimed, and most points were aimed at reducing inflation and energizing the economy by punishing tax evaders, black marketers, smugglers, and other real criminals. Prices did come down, production indexes rose dramatically, and even the monsoon proved cooperative by bringing abundant rains on time for two years in a row. But there were pitfalls that can't be filled.</li>
<li>
<strong>How is Social Enterprise relevant</strong>: Fundamentally there is less difference among Businesses, Government and NGOs. They all have resources and they have to effectively utilize to make society more livable. Difference is objectives. Businesses are profit driven. NGOs are service driven. Governments have to balance both. Rana Sen, MD in Deloitte Consulting LLP’s Public Sector practice, is among the corporate leaders who are part of major government transformation initiatives across varied and multiple program areas, such as smart city, administration, public health, and human services.</li>

It also talks about the net negative contributions made by NGOs.<br/><br/>Part [3] contains Chapters [7-9] - talks about the objectives of corporate companies and strategies in solving the problems most efficiently. How these private companies without the social enterprise framework introduce more problems in solution of one problem.<br/><br/>Part [4] contains Chapters [10-11] - talks about the role of politicians and increasing challenges they face living the life of leader. How conveniently obstacles for sustainable societies are ignored while appeasing the majority and creating active factions to fight for them.<br/><br/>Part [5] contains Chapters [12-15] - I proposed a new approach to driving impact in our world through combining tools and approaches from successful corporate companies, civil organizations, political parties.</p>

<h3>Where This Book Came From</h3>
<p>Shortly after my wife, Rochelle and I were married in 2000, I found out that I had a liver condition that would one day require me to have a liver transplant.  In 2012, that day came.  I am an Animator and Storyboard Artist by trade and have a hard time sitting still and not drawing, so while I was in the hospital and recovering, unable to work I wrote and illustrated 50% of this book.  It sat unfinished in my studio as life once again became busy, raising 3 children, coaching hockey and working as an animator and storyboard artist to support my family.  5 years after my initial transplant, problems occurred and I was forced to undergo yet another liver transplant.</p>

Join John Ezra and his partner Davy as they follow a centuries-old trail of breadcrumbs left by the founding fathers, as they move a device designed as a failsafe, against foreign invaders around the nation’s capital. The Agents of Ezra must find the device before it falls into the wrong hands, destroying the very country it was designed to protect.  </p><p>My name is J. Howard Harrington and I am the author of The L’Enfant Inquiry. I wrote this book because I felt an energy from the first moment I caught wind of a peculiar moment or odd historical figure in a new town. I knew this energy was a story that had yet to be told. This book is that energy coming to life, and I hope you join me on the adventure.  </p><p>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover history you had never heard of, look at things in a new way, and wonder “What if?” more than ever before. I want you to see this book as an opportunity to engage with actual history in an entertaining and leisurely way, as a chance to escape the wall around us and travel somewhere unimagined while having a few pieces of knowledge to take away because it is OUR history after all. </p><p><strong>THE NOVEL :</strong></p><p>A secret device to stop the British. A message hidden in the base of the Washington Monument. A mysterious figure that could unlock it all leading to a cascade of clues that unfold a centuries-old plan. But can John Ezra stay alive long enough to uncover what he seeks in time? </p><p>In the first Agents of Ezra Adventure, J. Howard Harrington’s Infinium Agent, John Ezra, is catapulted into a life of secrecy and adventure he would have never expected. From their headquarters deep beneath the national mall, they search for a device that relies on Ezra’s crack team of experts to read between the lines of history. Did an earthquake provide the first clue, or was it just good timing? Why would the nation rebury a man a century after his death in a location more prestigious than all the nation’s presidents? </p><p>The search for answers whisks John Ezra into a brutal game of intrigue, adventure, and gunfight. One which squares him off against an ambitious organization called The Inquiry and their muscle, the Colonel, who stands to gain as much as there is to lose if The Agents of Ezra don’t succeed. Traveling from the posh tree-lined cobblestone streets of Georgetown to a location none of us would expect, Ezra and Davy will confront the shocking realities that have been hidden in plain sight and the possibilities they can unleash on us all.</p><p><br/>You will love this book if you love discovering the unknown, are intrigued about secret agencies that exist right below our feet, or are someone that takes life by the horns and seizes adventure. The L’Enfant Inquiry speaks to the secret spy in us all, as well as any armchair adventurers who want to grapple with adventure hidden in our very own history, while also discovering the untold and unnoticed in a new way. </p><p>Ultimately, I hope that The L’Enfant Inquiry inspires reflection and fruitful dialogue, pressing into engaging questions like:</p><ul>
<li>What else is hiding in plain sight, only hidden by time? </li>
<li>Who among us is secretly working for a secret agency?</li>
<li>What other events and plans are boiling just below the surface in our world that could change our lives as we know them?  </li>
</ul><p>I look forward to exploring these questions and beyond with my readers.

It's about a teenage girl who takes up a mystical form of martial arts to avenge her murdered sister, and save her kidnapped brother. Here's the blurb on the back cover:</span><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p><i>When nine year old Sharie loses her family to the city's most prolific crime syndicate, Baklei, it ignites in her a howling thirst for revenge.</i></p>
<p><i>In pursuit of strength, she becomes the first disciple of Jeremiah, a Lethian martial artist. When Sharie becomes a Lethian Novice at sixteen, Jeremiah is called back to the Academy and Sharie must return to the city.

<p>The Lethian is around 600 pages of fast-paced action, and it took me three years to write and edit. It does have some violence and a few darker hints of the adult world, so I'd recommend it to readers aged 15 and up. If you like fast-paced action with a touch of depth and fantasy, and a dash of grit and mystery, then this is the book for you!</p>
<p><b>The book is ready to go, </b>but I need funds to do a print run. Technically I don't have to do a print run at all because I could just make it an e-book, but I'd really gosh darn like to! And so, I humbly ask you to consider taking part and supporting this campaign to help this book reach physical form.</p>

<p>I'm printing this book in a softcover trade paperback format, using a local printer in Hong Kong. Here, as in most places around the world, printing a 600 page novel is expensive.

</div></div>","I wrote a book!




Hellu! My real name is Sarah, but I'm also known as Rufi Angel, the webcomic artist and writer of Serpamia Flare. (I'm a storyteller at heart!) 
The Lethian is my first full-length young adult novel, and is a martial-arts fantasy based in a contemporary setting. It's about a teenage girl who takes up a mystical form of martial arts to avenge her murdered sister, and save her kidnapped brother. Here's the blurb on the back cover:

When nine year old Sharie loses her family to the city's most prolific crime syndicate, Baklei, it ignites in her a howling thirst for revenge.
In pursuit of strength, she becomes the first disciple of Jeremiah, a Lethian martial artist. When Sharie becomes a Lethian Novice at sixteen, Jeremiah is called back to the Academy and Sharie must return to the city. Against his orders she jumps into the DKC, Baklei's underground fighting circuit, in her search for her sister's killer. Determined to take back what she lost, she is drawn into a deeper world of drugs, prostitution, and brutality...


If you haven't seen the trailer video at the top of the page, on YouTube, or on Vimeo, please take a look!
The Lethian is around 600 pages of fast-paced action, and it took me three years to write and edit. It does have some violence and a few darker hints of the adult world, so I'd recommend it to readers aged 15 and up. If you like fast-paced action with a touch of depth and fantasy, and a dash of grit and mystery, then this is the book for you!
The book is ready to go, but I need funds to do a print run. Technically I don't have to do a print run at all because I could just make it an e-book, but I'd really gosh darn like to! And so, I humbly ask you to consider taking part and supporting this campaign to help this book reach physical form.
(Here's a brief peek at the novel cover!)





Where your support comes in


I'm printing this book in a softcover trade paperback format, using a local printer in Hong Kong. Here, as in most places around the world, printing a 600 page novel is expensive. The more copies I print, the lower the cost per book, so I am basing my current price estimates on printing at least a few hundred units. I'll adjust according to how the campaign goes! :)
Every bit of support will go straight to printing costs, and if I don't manage to raise the full amount, that's okay - I will still print! If I reach the funding goal early, any extra money will go into printing it with tiny frills, funding new perks or buying choco. 


Want a sample of the writing in the book? No problem! I have a couple of sample chapters from the earlier parts of the novel for you to check out. :) Chapter Two, and Chapter Twelve.



 

What perks are you offering?
 
The pre-order prices are lower than the pending final prices for the e-book and softcover, so if you pre-order through this campaign then you are getting a nice discount! :)
If that isn't enough and you want some extra goodies to go in your bag, I have some of those, too! Alongside the novel, I am also working on two collections of bonus content - a digital art book, and Off The Record: deleted scenes and outtakes. 

The art book will have both my own artwork and some awesome contributions by very talented artists! It's projected so far to be around 30 pages+. Some completed works I already have include artwork by jjak, Anjing, Deji, BlueTen, thumbjr, kaalashnikov and rtil. The rest are coming along and are still under the hood - once I start getting completions I'll be updating this list!

The art book will be available as a downloadable freebie after the preorder campaign is over, but the everyone who picks up the Lethian Maven Perk during the preorder campaign will instead get a 'deluxe' edition that includes:
- everything in the regular artbook
PLUS
- my rough sketches of characters and scenes- discarded character designs- 3-panel gag comics (3koma) starring the characters (sample below!)



Off The Record: deleted scenes and outtakes will not be freely downloadable after the campaign, and it will only be available to those who pick up the Lethian Maven Perk during the preorder campaign. It will be a collection of scenes I deleted from the book, with short commentary by me as to why it was removed. It will include:

<p><b><i>To Bleed or Not to Bleed</i></b> takes you on an up-close and personal journey with Håvve Fjell’s internationally renowned performance group, <a href=""http://www.painsolution.net/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Pain Solution</a>. Covering the period from 2003 until 2015, told in the words of the performers themselves, and seen through the lens of award winning photographer <a href=""http://helenefjell.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Helene Fjell</a>, this book is a must have for aficionados of sideshow, body art, extreme performance, and powerful photography.<br/></p>

<p><br/>This is the third book by the brother and sister team of Håvve and Helene Fjell. Their first book: <i>Ten Years of Pain</i> (Hertervig Forlag, 2003), covered the genesis and early years of Pain Solution. The second book: <i>Wings of Desire: Learning to Fly,</i> (<a href=""https://www.facebook.com/painsolutionmedia"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">PS Media</a>, 2012) was an award-winning look at the body suspension group <a href=""http://www.wingsofdesire.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Wings of Desire</a> that Håvve founded in 2002. <i>To Bleed or Not to Bleed</i> picks up the trail of Pain Solution where the first book left off. In the last decade, Pain Solution has grown and morphed into something larger than Håvve. The intensity remains but the group has become more playful, funny, whimsical, and accessible with the addition of The Maniac and The Princess of Scars to complement The HeadMaster, Håvve.</p>
<p><i>To Bleed or Not to Bleed</i> covers the trials and triumphs of Pain Solution through its second, exciting, and challenging decade of bringing their unique talents to the stage. It is the story of a lone performer who grooms two protégés to stand as equals at his side and, in the process, creates something larger than any of them could have made on their own. Håvve’s words (with contributions from The Maniac, and The Princess) combined with Helene’s striking and insightful photos provides you with a rare glimpse into these unique performers who give everything for their art.<br/></p>

After two years of pre-production, sifting through thousands of images, and a painstaking process of converting thoughts and feelings to text, what we need now is your help to make the last, crucial bit happen. Yes, as you guessed, we need a little bit of your money but—in true Pain Solution style—you can expect to get back more than you give!<br/><br/></p>
<strong>
</strong><h3>Who are we?</h3>
<strong>
</strong><p></p>
<strong>
</strong><p><strong>
</strong></p>
<p><strong><a href=""https://www.facebook.com/havve.fjell"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Håvve Fjell</a></strong> is the founder
and driving force behind <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/pain.solution.oslo"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Pain Solution</a>. Håvve’s uncompromising insistence on
keeping it real underlies the essence of the troupe that he founded. Pain
Solution, while performing all over the world for 25 years, has never ‘faked’
an act. Håvve insists that everything the audience sees on stage—shocking,
amazing, and entertaining—must be real. It has earned him and the troupe that
he founded utmost respect in the field of sideshow and body art performance.
Additionally, Håvve has worked with psychologists and members of the Mental
Health Services in his home country of Norway to help shed a more nuanced light
on pain related subjects from pain management to self-harm. For Håvve, Pain
Solution is more than a company of performers. Pain Solution is his calling.
This is something he needs to do. It is both entertainment and a message to the
world about the unacknowledged benefits and little understood power of pain,
blood, humor, and entertainment.</p>

<p><strong><a href=""https://www.facebook.com/pages/Helene-Fjell-Photography/323448807798979"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Helene Fjell</a> </strong>works as a freelance photographer, notably with fine art photography. She has followed Håvve’s work and the development of Pain Solution from the very beginning. Helene is more than a photographer; she has an extraordinary way of displaying the emotions and spirits of the people and surroundings in her photography. Her work is powerful, personal, intimate, and gives a sense of immediacy. In addition to numerous gallery shows in Norway and features in Scandinavian photography magazines, she has had exhibitions as far afield as Japan, Australia, and the USA. Helene’s massive archive of Pain Solution work is central to the production of <i>To Bleed or Not to Bleed</i>. For her previous collaboration with Håvve, Wings of Desire: Learning to Fly, she received an <a href=""http://www.photoawards.com/en/Pages/Gallery/hmention2013PRO.php"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Honorable Mention</a> from International Photography Awards (2013) and was a winner of the <a href=""http://www.pdnphotoannual.com/gallery/2013/gallery.php?category=PhotoBooks&amp;contest=fjell"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">2013 PDN Photo Annual award</a> for photo books.<br/><br/></p>

Since founding their company in 1999, they have worked tirelessly producing work for some of Norway’s most notable artists, theaters, galleries and  publishers. They are perhaps most famous for their work producing album covers for groups such as Ulver, Mayhem, Darkthrone, Solefald, Shining, and more. Their attention to detail and exquisite design helped to make <i>Wings of Desire: Learning to Fly</i> the truly beautiful book that it is. Pain Solution is overjoyed to have them onboard again to package the text and images of <i>To Bleed or Not to Bleed</i> into a unique, superbly crafted work of art.<br/><br/>

<p><b>June Ailin Bonsaksen</b>  will be reprising the Project Manager role that she excelled at through the making and shipping of <i>Wings of Desire: Learning to Fly</i>. Every great artist and successful project team should be lucky enough to have someone to help them keep their metaphorical wheels on the rails! For <i>To Bleed or Not to Bleed</i>, June is the person holding everything together and making sure that order prevails. June began working for Håvve as a volunteer in 2007. She quickly moved from running errands and selling merchandise to her position as the Pain Solution Secretary. Since then, she has been the administrative engine at the heart of Pain Solution where she manages the websites, merchandise and book orders, volunteer crews, <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/wings.of.desire.oslo"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Wings of Desire</a> suspension events, and PS Media projects with style and grace.<br/><br/></p>

He is a team leader in the Wings of Desire suspension crew and has worked with Håvve for years on many different projects. Alan edited <i>Wings of Desire: Learning to Fly</i> and has a knack for leaving the author’s voice as intact as possible while making sure that grammar is being reasonably respected and that sense is still being made.</p>

<p>“The exploration of physical pain as such, is nothing
new. But with the update Håvve Fjell, with various co-performers, has given it through
the past ten years, where the extreme physical experience has taken the shape
of an independent artistic medium of the same caliber as painting and video
art, Pain Solution places itself—as the bearers of a tradition as old as the
species- actually, in all senses, at a point in the outer marginal one have to

</div></div>","To Bleed or Not to Bleed takes you on an up-close and personal journey with Håvve Fjell’s internationally renowned performance group, Pain Solution. Covering the period from 2003 until 2015, told in the words of the performers themselves, and seen through the lens of award winning photographer Helene Fjell, this book is a must have for aficionados of sideshow, body art, extreme performance, and powerful photography.



This is the third book by the brother and sister team of Håvve and Helene Fjell. Their first book: Ten Years of Pain (Hertervig Forlag, 2003), covered the genesis and early years of Pain Solution. The second book: Wings of Desire: Learning to Fly, (PS Media, 2012) was an award-winning look at the body suspension group Wings of Desire that Håvve founded in 2002. To Bleed or Not to Bleed picks up the trail of Pain Solution where the first book left off. In the last decade, Pain Solution has grown and morphed into something larger than Håvve. The intensity remains but the group has become more playful, funny, whimsical, and accessible with the addition of The Maniac and The Princess of Scars to complement The HeadMaster, Håvve.
To Bleed or Not to Bleed covers the trials and triumphs of Pain Solution through its second, exciting, and challenging decade of bringing their unique talents to the stage. It is the story of a lone performer who grooms two protégés to stand as equals at his side and, in the process, creates something larger than any of them could have made on their own. Håvve’s words (with contributions from The Maniac, and The Princess) combined with Helene’s striking and insightful photos provides you with a rare glimpse into these unique performers who give everything for their art.


With layout of this brilliant synthesis of words and images executed by the acclaimed Trine + Kim Design Studio, this book will be a work of art in itself. After two years of pre-production, sifting through thousands of images, and a painstaking process of converting thoughts and feelings to text, what we need now is your help to make the last, crucial bit happen. Yes, as you guessed, we need a little bit of your money but—in true Pain Solution style—you can expect to get back more than you give!

Who are we?





Håvve Fjell is the founder
and driving force behind Pain Solution. Håvve’s uncompromising insistence on
keeping it real underlies the essence of the troupe that he founded. Pain
Solution, while performing all over the world for 25 years, has never ‘faked’
an act. Håvve insists that everything the audience sees on stage—shocking,
amazing, and entertaining—must be real. It has earned him and the troupe that
he founded utmost respect in the field of sideshow and body art performance.
Additionally, Håvve has worked with psychologists and members of the Mental
Health Services in his home country of Norway to help shed a more nuanced light
on pain related subjects from pain management to self-harm. For Håvve, Pain
Solution is more than a company of performers. Pain Solution is his calling.
This is something he needs to do. It is both entertainment and a message to the
world about the unacknowledged benefits and little understood power of pain,
blood, humor, and entertainment.

Helene Fjell works as a freelance photographer, notably with fine art photography. She has followed Håvve’s work and the development of Pain Solution from the very beginning. Helene is more than a photographer; she has an extraordinary way of displaying the emotions and spirits of the people and surroundings in her photography. Her work is powerful, personal, intimate, and gives a sense of immediacy. In addition to numerous gallery shows in Norway and features in Scandinavian photography magazines, she has had exhibitions as far afield as Japan, Australia, and the USA. Helene’s massive archive of Pain Solution work is central to the production of To Bleed or Not to Bleed. For her previous collaboration with Håvve, Wings of Desire: Learning to Fly, she received an Honorable Mention from International Photography Awards (2013) and was a winner of the 2013 PDN Photo Annual award for photo books.

Trine + Kim Design Studio have been working with Pain Solution since 2007 using their exceptional talent and creativity to carve out a distinct visual profile for Pain Solution. Since founding their company in 1999, they have worked tirelessly producing work for some of Norway’s most notable artists, theaters, galleries and  publishers. They are perhaps most famous for their work producing album covers for groups such as Ulver, Mayhem, Darkthrone, Solefald, Shining, and more. Their attention to detail and exquisite design helped to make Wings of Desire: Learning to Fly the truly beautiful book that it is. Pain Solution is overjoyed to have them onboard again to package the text and images of To Bleed or Not to Bleed into a unique, superbly crafted work of art.

June Ailin Bonsaksen  will be reprising the Project Manager role that she excelled at through the making and shipping of Wings of Desire: Learning to Fly. Every great artist and successful project team should be lucky enough to have someone to help them keep their metaphorical wheels on the rails! For To Bleed or Not to Bleed, June is the person holding everything together and making sure that order prevails. June began working for Håvve as a volunteer in 2007. She quickly moved from running errands and selling merchandise to her position as the Pain Solution Secretary. Since then, she has been the administrative engine at the heart of Pain Solution where she manages the websites, merchandise and book orders, volunteer crews, Wings of Desire suspension events, and PS Media projects with style and grace.
Alan Louis Belardinelli is an American expatriate living in Oslo. He has long experience working with communications including work as a corporate spokesperson, lyric and speech writing, authoring and editing documents and plans, translating Norwegian to English, and proofreading English written by non-native speakers. He is a team leader in the Wings of Desire suspension crew and has worked with Håvve for years on many different projects. Alan edited Wings of Desire: Learning to Fly and has a knack for leaving the author’s voice as intact as possible while making sure that grammar is being reasonably respected and that sense is still being made.
What We Need & What You Get
 

Living in Norway is a blessing and a curse. While Norway is one of the world’s best countries to live in, it is also one of the most expensive. We have made the decision to produce the book locally so that we can both support local printers and have the highest possible level of quality control. We need your help to pay for printing and distribution of To Bleed or Not to Bleed.We are proud to say that we have received initial support from The Arts Council of Norway to get us rolling. We used most of that money to upgrade and update our old and slow hardware and software, as well as covering other pre-production costs. We still have a lot of expenses to cover and for this we need your help. We are not, however, asking you to give us money for nothing! We are offering you the chance to pre-order your signed and numbered copy of To Bleed or Not to Bleed at a special pre-order price and throwing in some extra perks as well! We know this book will be great. Our first two publications received acclaim and awards, and we feel this will be our best work yet!The money we raise through this campaign will cover editing, production management, design, printing, binding, and shipping of this one of a kind book. That said, almost the entire cost is printing and shipping.  Our dedicated designers, Trine + Kim Design Studio, have been working with Pain Solution for years and have previously donated their time and skills at a symbolic rate. This time around, we have calculated a decent, while still modest, fee for their amazing work. Alan and June, who love this book, are working at the nicest possible rates doing Editing and Project Management work.  Neither the photographer nor the author will profit until this project is printed and delivered.Help us make history! 
Your contribution enables us to leave a trace in history. Books that document working sideshow or the life of a modern Fakir are few and far between.

<p>On May 23-24, the local community is coming together to co-create the founding year of an arts and music festival on the Stokkseyrarsel sustainable farm in Iceland. </p>
<p>The festival serves as a space where people can collect and share stories, and build authentic connections to each other and nature. It will be focused on vulnerability, community, sustainability and transformation.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Through the efforts of more than 100 volunteers, Saga Fest will feature 65+ artists and musicians from 13 countries, including local showcases of artists and musicians from the villages of Eyrarbakki (pop. 570) and Stokkseyri (pop. 455).</p>
<p>There will be more than 15 workshops for festival-goers to participate in and more than 65 immersive art and musical experiences.</p>
<p>The festival is largely participatory, which means that we encourage people to take ownership of the festival's overall direction and experience.</p>
<p>We are committed to ideating and co-creating the festival in partnership with the local community.</p>
<p>We do this through monthly Town Hall meetings where we invite the local community—farmers, local business owners, educators, youth, government officials and artists—to dream up the festival with us.</p>

</div>","What's Our Story?
Music and art can inspire real change.Based on the transformative power of sharing and creating stories, Saga is connecting people to each other and the planet.Together, we build communities that promotes openness, creativity and change. We want you to come as you are, and we want you to leave as a changed person. In Iceland, we have been told by scientists, writers, politicians and community leaders that our world is suffering from large-scale challenges like climate change. But many feel that these issues are ""too big"" to change, and that there isn't much we can do to build a more thriving and just world.But we will not idly stand by and accept this fate. We know that a small group of people, driven by shared purpose, can truly catalyze large-scale movements. They always have. Our vision is to help create this community through arts, music and storytelling.Together, we can re-author our narratives.
Saga Fest
Creating a Cultural Movement and Shift
On May 23-24, the local community is coming together to co-create the founding year of an arts and music festival on the Stokkseyrarsel sustainable farm in Iceland. 
The festival serves as a space where people can collect and share stories, and build authentic connections to each other and nature. It will be focused on vulnerability, community, sustainability and transformation.

Through the efforts of more than 100 volunteers, Saga Fest will feature 65+ artists and musicians from 13 countries, including local showcases of artists and musicians from the villages of Eyrarbakki (pop. 570) and Stokkseyri (pop. 455).
There will be more than 15 workshops for festival-goers to participate in and more than 65 immersive art and musical experiences.
The festival is largely participatory, which means that we encourage people to take ownership of the festival's overall direction and experience.
We are committed to ideating and co-creating the festival in partnership with the local community.
We do this through monthly Town Hall meetings where we invite the local community—farmers, local business owners, educators, youth, government officials and artists—to dream up the festival with us.

























Saga Fest Artist Residency
Supporting innovative, community-focused artists 


During the week before the two-day festival, a group of 11 artists from six different countries will come together at the Saga Fest site.
The artists will hold workshops with local youth (aged 11-15) from the Árborg region to create original artwork to be exhibited and performed at Saga Fest. 
These workshops will take place on May 20th in Selfoss and are free to youth participants. The artwork created by the students and visiting artists will be displayed and performed from 3-5 p.m. on Sunday, May 24th at Saga Fest. 

Your contribution will assist us with powering this year's festival. As a founding year supporter, you will be a part of the Tribe that will help make this annual festival a continued reality. 















Saga Summit

Connecting to Others, Purpose and Nature


Provided at no cost to a group of 25 Iceland-based entrepreneurs, artists, chefs, musicians, farmers, storytellers and activists, we gathered this small group of leaders in the village of Ríf located at the base of Snæfellsjökull. 
After six months of work, three facilitators working from the USA, Denmark and Iceland designed and launched a 4-day immersive experience called Saga Summit.
Participants were also encouraged to ideate on projects that they could collaborate on together, and at least four (4) campaigns and projects were created as a direct result of Saga Summit.
Your contribution would go toward supporting these campaigns and projects, and the continuation of existing social enterprises and pop-up experiences that were workshopped during Saga Summit.
















Saga Media
Community-Driven Storytelling for Causes

Imagine a crowd-funding platform like IndieGoGo, but supporters submit high-quality audiovisual content instead of dollars. Non-profit organizations would be able to create campaigns around causes and collectively source knowledge and content from people around the world.
This kind of initiative would not only help cut costs for non-profit organizations with limited resources, but it also helps movements tell more inclusive and well-rounded stories. We also believe that all multimedia collected on such a platform should be open-sourced and available for any non-profit to use, free of charge.
Capitalizing on experiences like Saga Summit and Saga Fest, we hope to not only create spaces of story sharing, but also capture stories in various media forms: photographs, audio and film. 


Funding
What happens to my contribution?



Saga is a registered not-for-profit entity based in Iceland focused on creating initiatives that build communities and promote sustainability.



Reaching our goal of $7,500 will help us work toward fully funding this year's initiatives.

<li><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Social models whether it is a person (Rachel Maddow or one's parent for example) or an institution (the Republican Party or Human Rights Campaign)</span></li>

Language is a tool that all people and institutions use when discussing dynamics associated LGBT issues. For example, a church states that marriage is between only a man and woman, a conservative TV host calls gay people homosexuals, a political party candidate states ""I'm against any laws that give special attention to gay or transgendered people.""</p><p>Language is not just expression, but it affects our attitudes on a daily basis whether we know it or not: ""That's so gay""; marriage equality; gay union; fag; queer; straight; coming out; bend over and take it; gay rights; homosexual lifestyle; gay agenda ...</p><p><br/></p><h1>WHY CROWDFUNDING?</h1><p></p><p>Queer Sense will change how we think about the influence of culture. It will make people more aware of the necessary factors to foster LGBT acceptance. </p><p>For instance, we can look at schools with Gay Straight Alliances (GSA) which reduce bullying, lower mental health problems associated with alienation of LGBT people and prevent suicide. This is not all though.  A GSA make LGBT people visible, opened conversations to LGBT issues, give an opportunity for LGBT identified students to openly connect to not only other LGBT-identified students but to supportive heterosexual students, teachers, and parents. GSA in school systems foster better awareness of the language used on a daily basis and provide active social models for both heterosexual and LGBT students.</p><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1302330/files/20150317081825-QS_Tshirt_revised.jpg?1426605505"" src="""" style=""""/><br/></p><h1><br/></h1><h1>ABOUT THE AUTHOR</h1><div>Bryce is a Kansan, psychologist, author, and LGBT activist who came out three times in a row when he was 13 years old, but rejection led him back into the closet until his late 20s, or the year of 2000. When he came out in his late 20s he discovered several of his old friends had turned their backs to him because they rejected his gay identity. One very close evangelical friend promised to be his friend if only Bryce ""never acted on any tendencies"" and lead a straight life. Bryce realized he was alone on a new path that no one else could understand, or could they?<br/>
</div><div>Bryce searched to connect to people in his community who used a positive language when discussing the LGBT community. He traveled to San Francisco where he discovered a culture that was the opposite of the Midwest. Social models who had positive attitudes towards LGBT people were abundant in this culture, a positive language was used when discussing the LGBT community, heterosexual people were overwhelming supportive of LGBT rights, and there was more access to LGBT support groups.<br/>
</div><div>Several years later Bryce reflected on his experiences and developed his model called Queer Sense. Queer Sense is a model that helps us understand how culture shapes attitudes towards LGBT individuals. The striking feature of Queer Sense are the three factors that are constantly at work in any given culture whether it be in Kansas or San Francisco: social models, connections to social models, and the language we use our social models.<br/>

The model is remarkable as it describes active factors that are shaping attitudes towards LGBT individuals: 
Social models whether it is a person (Rachel Maddow or one's parent for example) or an institution (the Republican Party or Human Rights Campaign)
The emotional connections we make with those models, aka attachment (close relationship with one's parent or your political party)

The language we use with those social models (homosexual lifestyle versus gay relationships)

WHAT SETS QS APART FROM TRADITIONAL QUEER THEORY?Queer Sense is the first theory in the literature that not only describes the interaction of three factors that shape attitudes towards LGBT, but it is the only model that specifically gives credit to the power of language. Language is a tool that all people and institutions use when discussing dynamics associated LGBT issues. For example, a church states that marriage is between only a man and woman, a conservative TV host calls gay people homosexuals, a political party candidate states ""I'm against any laws that give special attention to gay or transgendered people.""Language is not just expression, but it affects our attitudes on a daily basis whether we know it or not: ""That's so gay""; marriage equality; gay union; fag; queer; straight; coming out; bend over and take it; gay rights; homosexual lifestyle; gay agenda ...WHY CROWDFUNDING?Queer Sense will change how we think about the influence of culture. It will make people more aware of the necessary factors to foster LGBT acceptance. For instance, we can look at schools with Gay Straight Alliances (GSA) which reduce bullying, lower mental health problems associated with alienation of LGBT people and prevent suicide. This is not all though.  A GSA make LGBT people visible, opened conversations to LGBT issues, give an opportunity for LGBT identified students to openly connect to not only other LGBT-identified students but to supportive heterosexual students, teachers, and parents. GSA in school systems foster better awareness of the language used on a daily basis and provide active social models for both heterosexual and LGBT students.ABOUT THE AUTHORBryce is a Kansan, psychologist, author, and LGBT activist who came out three times in a row when he was 13 years old, but rejection led him back into the closet until his late 20s, or the year of 2000. When he came out in his late 20s he discovered several of his old friends had turned their backs to him because they rejected his gay identity. One very close evangelical friend promised to be his friend if only Bryce ""never acted on any tendencies"" and lead a straight life. Bryce realized he was alone on a new path that no one else could understand, or could they?
Bryce searched to connect to people in his community who used a positive language when discussing the LGBT community. He traveled to San Francisco where he discovered a culture that was the opposite of the Midwest. Social models who had positive attitudes towards LGBT people were abundant in this culture, a positive language was used when discussing the LGBT community, heterosexual people were overwhelming supportive of LGBT rights, and there was more access to LGBT support groups.
Several years later Bryce reflected on his experiences and developed his model called Queer Sense. Queer Sense is a model that helps us understand how culture shapes attitudes towards LGBT individuals. The striking feature of Queer Sense are the three factors that are constantly at work in any given culture whether it be in Kansas or San Francisco: social models, connections to social models, and the language we use our social models.

Four teenagers, randomly chosen are summoned by a greater being known as the eye. Each of the “Chosen” are decided to be mentored by one of the Greek Gods as they are taught the ways of the elements before the first strike of the “Corrupted” is attempted. This series I’m working on has been an idea in my head for months now and my thoughts are that it’d draw a lot of the attention of watchers for Supernatural, The Last Airbender, and even the famous cartoon Naruto.

I’m 14 years old and on my way to being, possibly, the youngest screenplay writer ever. I’ve only started recently to put into action typing out screenplays after learning some things from my parents who are getting one sold of their own.

</div></div>","hi, i am Elsa from Estonia and i am writing a book in English.
truth being said . . .
I NEED A TRIBE TO BIRTH THE BOOK IN ME.
i don't think we need to do this important work alone. definitely not in isolation. but instead together to support one another.
HERE'S WHAT I CAN OFFER.
i will bring you real stories from real people with real lives which all sum up my broken life only to show how everything in our life has gifts to give.
no fiction. only the unspoken.
i will tell unique stories never told before.stories that touch our humanness, our brokenness.
the book LOVE OR FEAR: THE JOURNEY INTO THE UNKNOWN is an epic story of the clash between the mind and the heart, and how fears learn to love.
by reading my words you might, and possibly will, unlock your potential, your unapologetic, unpolished truth. and your honesty will come out and play.
 
speaking about our experiences gives a voice to the voiceless parts within ourselves.
BY MATT KAHN
who's it for?
most importantly, its for people who seek a message . . . 

of hope

of faith

of trust


and its for you if . . .

you seek to be seen

you seek to be heard

you seek to be honest

you seek to feel relaxed

you seek to speak your truth

you seek to unravel judgement

you seek to love deeper and be loved

you seek to be fearless in your choices

you seek to balance the mind and heart

you seek to cut negative voice in your head


and as a bonus . . .
you seek to have healthier relationships in all areas in your life - with partners, friends, family, and coworkers.

once ready, i will publish it, i will ship it.
hopefully, in 2022 or at the latest in 2023, you get to hold the book in your hands. i will do my best to make it happen.

the book LOVE OR FEAR: THE JOURNEY INTO THE UNKNOWN is my roadmap to see how fears learn to love.

my intention is to tell stories that whispers these words to the pain within us all . . .

in celebration for that, my book starts with a line, here's my story, and it end with a line, what's your story?

LETS HEAL THROUGH STORIES, TOGETHER.
risk it - i need your help
if this Indiegogo campaign will reach the minimum, then i get to swap my dying laptop, and while i write the book, on monthly bases i will bring you 1 to 4 real stories from real people with real lives on how fears learn to love.
if this campaign will smash the minimum, then i have a shot at working with a good editor who will help make the book worth your attention, your time, and your money.
if this campaign will not reach the minimum, backers will be charged, and backers will get all their perks. the book will be written and shipped as promised. but getting a new laptop to exchange the dying one is under question. also, i don't get to work with an editor.
PS.
BECOMING A MEMBER OF THE TRIBE, TO RECEIVE STORIES BY EMAIL, IS OPTIONAL. YOU GET TO SAY YES OR NO WHEN BACKING UP THE CAMPAIGN.

book synopsis
in the book LOVE OR FEAR: THE JOURNEY INTO THE UNKNOWN i will tell a story of an orphan, me - elsa saks, who at age 8 got adopted into an emotionally dysfunctional family environment; who in her mid-twenties took her 75-liter backpack and left the known, in search for love, for meaning in life.
first, for 2.5 years, she traveled with money. then, for the next 3 years, she traveled with no money.
it was then when in the magic of the unknown she met the world of infinite generosity.
fearless, then fearful she did what only few have ever done.

6 years
33 countries
4 continents
few language skills
hundreds of helpers
10’000 km on a bicycle
36 months moneyless through 27 countries


this video illustrates the joyful side of the adventure i took between the dates june to november 2015. the story covers my first five months through six countries on a bicycle in central america.

I wrote this book because I never saw myself represented or considered in minority politics in America and felt overlooked and not represented in the media, as well.<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover how minority politics, business, and the law not only influence each other but also depend on one another. In this book, I hope to instill in you the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for the intersection of consumerism, politics, and the law. Ultimately, I want you to see this book as a tool to help you learn the potential of changing heteronormative sects of society with the liberalization of information and voice that social media and technology has brought to this area.<br/><br/><strong>In this book, you'll hear stories such as...</strong></p><ul>
<li>Considerations of feminism in the South Korean film industry, what defamation law has done to encourage intersectionality, how the South Korean legal system has failed or supported artists </li>
<li>What minority influencers on TikTok, Youtube, &amp; Instagram believe their contribution and influence is to corporate culture and national politics </li>
<li>What it meant to be poor and without access to medication</li>
<li>Growing up as a minority creative and seeing particular identities over others</li>
<li>Asian Americans' positioning in American consumer culture and politics </li>
<li>The relationship between identifying as disabled and being a part of corporate culture</li>
<li>Debating whether corporate marketing of disabled and other minority bodies is an indication of changing ideologies in more conservative sects of society, whether it is an act of good-will or simply for profit </li>

<h3>The storyline</h3>
<p><i>The Underdog Paradox</i> chronicles the journeys of five entrepreneurs overcoming extraordinary adversity en route to building a brighter future for themselves and their communities. My name is Jamie Russo and over the past decade I’ve traveled from inner city schools to refugee camps, hospitals to prisons. Along the way, I’ve met some of the human beings behind the greatest comeback stories.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Marcus Bullock</strong> was 16 years old when he was sentenced to eight years in adult maximum security prison. Two decades later, Marcus is the founder and CEO of Flikshop, the mobile application keeping families connected to incarcerated loved ones.</li>
<li>
<strong>Lual Mayen</strong> grew up in a refugee camp on the outskirts of Northern Uganda. After fleeing the violent civil war in South Sudan, Lual taught himself to write code and build video games. Today, he’s the founder and CEO of Junub Games, a mobile gaming company that builds games for peace and social impact.</li>
<li>
<strong>Shavini Fernando </strong>was hiking through the hills near her hometown in Sri Lanka when she suddenly lost her breath. Rushed to the hospital, Shavini was notified by doctors that she had severe pulmonary hypertension and less than two years to live, due to a hole in her heart. Today, Shavini fights for her life, building medical devices at Oxiwear that monitor oxygen levels for patients with PH.</li>
</ul>
<p><i>The Underdog Paradox</i> is for anyone that enjoys a good underdog story. It is a book that will inspire modern day changemakers, activists, and aspiring entrepreneurs. Theses stories provide proof: no matter who you are, where you’re from, or what you want to be, you have the power inside yourself to put a dent in the universe.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>The book contains five parts</h3>
<p><strong>Part 1 is about Hope</strong>. On November 15th, 1991, during the Second Sudanese Civil War, the Bor Massacre occurred, killing an estimate of 2000 civilians in Bor. The massacre was carried out by Nuer fighters from SPLA-Nasir, a faction of the Sudan People’s Liberation Army (SPLA). They were led by Riek Machar from SPLA and a militant group known as the Nuer White Army. That day, a woman made a narrow escape with her husband and two daughters. For 250 miles, she and her family traveled on foot in search of a place for refuge. The woman and her husband arrived at a small village called Aswa at the border near Northern Uganda. Her girls did not survive the trip. On that day, she bore a son. She named him Lual.<br/><br/><strong>Part 2 is about Resilience</strong>. One evening, after watching the nightly news with his then five-year-old son, Marcus’s son asked him a question he thought he would have a ton of time to answer. Marcus thought the complicated questions typically came at eight or nine years old. But in that moment, Marcus’s son lay awake in bed and asked his father with a straight face, ""Daddy, why did you go to jail?"" He knew this question was coming, but in that moment it felt so rushed. Marcus cleared his throat, looked his son in the eyes, and told his son about the time that he was sentenced to eight years in adult maximum security prison when he was just 15 years old.<br/><br/><strong>Part 3 is about Authenticity</strong>. Clarence grew up in a broken household in Atlanta, Georgia. His father abused drugs and alcohol, which his mother worked hard to keep her four children fed. “My father beat my mother every day for the first 15 years of my life,” Clarence recalls. “I sold drugs just to have enough money to eat and buy clothes.” Clarence lacked passion in the classroom and skipped school regularly, but made up for his lack of discipline on the basketball court. Eventually, basketball became Clarence’s ticket out of Atlanta. Later on, basketball offered Clarence opportunities that almost nobody would have ever seen coming.<br/><br/><strong>Part 4 is about Humility</strong>. Manu moved from South Eastern France to the United States alone when he was 17 years old. Like many other international students, Manu struggled financially. He was restricted to working on campus, taking as many jobs as he could. He tutored classmates in math, physics, and computer science. He was an indoor soccer referee. You name it, Manu did it. Years later, while working at a prestigious consulting firm, a student contacted Manu, saying, “I’m $500 short on my rent this month. I’m going to get evicted, and I’m thinking about dropping out of school. Can you help?” In that moment, a fire began to burn inside Manu’s mind. It was a message that would completely transform Manu’s life, forever.<br/><br/><strong>Part 5 is about Wisdom</strong>. Shavini Fernando was hiking through the hills near her hometown in Sri Lanka when she suddenly lost her breath. She was rushed to the hospital, where she was shuttled into emergency surgery. A few hours later, the doctors emerged. They notified Shavini that she was suffering from severe pulmonary hypertension and that an MRI revealed a hole in her heart. With less than two years to live, Shavini made it her life’s mission to find a solution. The story that follows is nothing less than extraordinary.<br/> </p>

<h3>Her Story</h3>
<p>After 39 long years, Rebecca is finally turning 40.  We can't believe it. She's grown so much and has graciously and courageously made it through each birthday!  As she approaches this major milestone, she continues to embrace all that life has to offer and pursue her dreams. Her latest dream involves writing...and some of you know that my sister is a very gifted writer.  For her 40th birthday she is dreaming of participating in a creative writing workshop that is about discovering your own unique and powerful story.  It seems she may delight the world with the tale of Rebecca Ann Trobe. </p>
<p>I LOVE this idea and thought I'd campaign on her behalf and give all of you an opportunity to help make this happen for her. </p>

<title></title>
<h4><b>Sharing Your Life Story: From the Page to the Stage</b></h4>
<p>
Everything in your life, from the mundane to the extraordinary, is a story waiting to be told. This workshop is an invitation to discover your own unique and powerful story. Michel de Montaigne, the great personal essayist, said, “Every man has within himself the entire human condition.” The intention of this workshop is for you to delve deep into your own personal narrative.<br/><br/></p>
<p>
Writing from your deepest source, gain insight and self-understanding that can bring peace and healing. You will then make your words leap from the page to the stage, sharing them orally to uncover the power of story to transform your life and your listeners.<br/><br/></p>
<p>
Through improvisation, writing exercises, and group discussion, you will find your authentic voice, along with an honest, organic way to express your truth. Ann Randolph creates a supportive, fun, and dynamic space to create. All levels are welcome. This is a workshop for those seeking to explore personal essay, memoir, solo performance, or the sacred practice of journaling.</p>

</div></div>","Her Story
After 39 long years, Rebecca is finally turning 40.  We can't believe it. She's grown so much and has graciously and courageously made it through each birthday!  As she approaches this major milestone, she continues to embrace all that life has to offer and pursue her dreams. Her latest dream involves writing...and some of you know that my sister is a very gifted writer.  For her 40th birthday she is dreaming of participating in a creative writing workshop that is about discovering your own unique and powerful story.  It seems she may delight the world with the tale of Rebecca Ann Trobe. 
I LOVE this idea and thought I'd campaign on her behalf and give all of you an opportunity to help make this happen for her. 


The Details of the Workshop




Sharing Your Life Story: From the Page to the Stage

Everything in your life, from the mundane to the extraordinary, is a story waiting to be told. This workshop is an invitation to discover your own unique and powerful story. Michel de Montaigne, the great personal essayist, said, “Every man has within himself the entire human condition.” The intention of this workshop is for you to delve deep into your own personal narrative.

Writing from your deepest source, gain insight and self-understanding that can bring peace and healing. You will then make your words leap from the page to the stage, sharing them orally to uncover the power of story to transform your life and your listeners.

Through improvisation, writing exercises, and group discussion, you will find your authentic voice, along with an honest, organic way to express your truth. Ann Randolph creates a supportive, fun, and dynamic space to create. All levels are welcome. This is a workshop for those seeking to explore personal essay, memoir, solo performance, or the sacred practice of journaling.



What We Need 

The cost of the workshop is $800.
If you want to help celebrate Rebecca turning 40 -- donate to the workshop fund!  
Any contribution helps us reach our goal!  Give what you can...THANKS!  :)

Within a week, Daniel is caught in a dangerous, downward spiral of deceit, corruption and treachery. Within months, and against his will, he’s embroiled in espionage and murder.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>When my partner had an accident and was in a wheelchair for a long time, and thankfully not forever I was required to care for him, our two beautiful children and earn an income. I became a Work At Home Parent and I have never worked so hard in a job before.</p>
<p>All our living expenses were now up to me whilst caring for my beautiful family. I spent many sleepless nights trying to get my business out there and even resulted making myself so sick I had to be hospitalised. I made a successful home business and now I want to help other work at home parents do the same. I want to published them at low prices to help get their businesses out there. I want to provide them with invaluable information from professionals that we wouldn't usually get to speak to. I want to provide them an ongoing community of never ending support and I want this to always be free to readers.</p>
<p>My dream is to create an online magazine to showcase and publish other WAHPs at very low rates (under $5) to help get their businesses out there as I know how hard it can be. This will be a monthly edition showcasing other work at home parents work and talent as well as including many editorials of successful WAHPs, interviews from some of the most known WAHPs, How Tos and much much more. Our content is being grown by the day by amazing people wanting to contribute to this magazine and help other work at home parents.</p>
<p>It is important that this magazine is an electronic and not printed edition as we are aware of the effects on the environment. We want to move forward with saving paper for future generations and our way to be able to contribute is making this an electronic publication and never printed to paper.</p>
<p>Your contribution small or large will be helping thousands of work at home parents trying to make an income for their families whilst still being able to stay at home with their much loved children. As this is an ongoing project you will be able to view your ongoing contribution and know you were a part of this amazing issue.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>To get this project off the ground successfully we require $5,000.00 for software to develop the online magazine, set up a fully functional website where our writers have access to add content via the blogs section, a forum to interact with our readers and themselves, the plugins to have the magazine viewable from computers, electronic readers and mobiles. We also require a computer to replace the dinosaur I use now to run the software required to put this all together. We also require a small amount to be used to help us get the word out there to as many people as we can.</p>
<p>This is the first magazine of its kind to be published in Australia only. Not only do we have a great range of writers willing to contribute and share their wisdom we have features like no others. Small fees (less than $5.00) for WAHPs to be published, free classifieds, a monthly catalogue showcasing WAHPs products included in the magazine every month. We also have some fabulous individuals such as personal trainers, business advisers and more to confirm in the coming weeks willing to contribute and help.</p>
<p>If the full amount is not raised we can still use smaller amounts to pay for yearly internet hosting, software and advertising costs. All money raised no matter how small can help to make this magazine get started.</p>
<p>What you get? We want to help you and thank you for any contribution you can make! All contirbutors will be announced and thanked on our website and in our publications. We understand without your help this cannot happen and we will forever be grateful! Different perks will have more involvement with the magazine, please see below for more details.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>It is extremely hard starting your own business from home and letting the world know what you are doing. Advertising rates are so high most work at home parents can not even consider this option. We give the opportunity to advertise and showcase their businesses at free and very cheap rates. We understand how hard it is being WAHPs outselves and I want to make this easier for people starting out. There is so much talent to be shown from WAHPs, we want to find these people and share them to the world, as well as providing an ongoing supportive community to help them keep going with their journeys.</p>
<p>By contributing you are making this happen and helping thousands of parents. Not only by helping to get their business out there, make an income for thier families when it wouldnt be possible otherwise and stay at home with their children. You are also helping the readers find these talented people and purchase more affordable items that can cost huge amounts in department stores. WAHPs are known for finding ways to save on costs of production and passing these savings onto their customers.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you cannot contribute funds we understand. Believe us we do, otherwise we wouldnt be putting this campaign out there. There are other ways you can help though, that are free and require only your time. Help us spread the word about what we are doing and that we are accepting contributions for our start up costs. Indiegogo have numerous share tools that make getting the word out there easy.</p>
<p>Are you a WAHP who loves writing and helping others? We are always looking for parents wanting to write and be published with us. Any ideas you have that can help us help other work at home parents we would be grateful to receive so please get in touch with us.</p>

We've created and self-funded what we're calling Issue Zero, which you can enjoy enjoy here, featuring new writing from Jason Diamond, Eric Anthony Glover, Kima Jones, Matthew Salesses, and Benjamin Samuel; an interview between Lauren O'Neal and Callie Collins about Callie's experience co-founding the new independent press, A Strange Object; and illustrations accompanying every piece by Lyndsey Lesh, Jason Novak, Lara Odell, Nancy Smith, and Kristen Tomanocy.Our plan is to publish six beautifully-illustrated pieces per month and to continue to make Midnight Breakfast free to read. We're betting that enough of you want to help us support the work of writers and artists like those in Issue Zero that we can make this plan a reality. If we raise our goal of $12,000, we'll be able to keep Midnight Breakfast alive for a year. All of the money you donate will go towards supporting the work of writers and visual artists and towards maintaining the website.What Can I Do?Donate! Even the smallest donations can make a huge difference. For those of you who can afford a little more, we've got loads of amazing perks from our generous friends and supporters in the literary community and beyond. (And as an extra token of our appreciation, for all donations over $20 we'll throw in a Midnight Breakfast bookmark, a temporary tattoo, and a thank you on the site.)Another way you can help is by getting the word out. The more people who know about our campaign, the better our chances of succeeding. Post about Midnight Breakfast and link to our campaign (igg.me/at/mbfast) on Facebook or give us a shout-out on Twitter.If you have any questions, comments, or concerns, please shoot us an email at hello@midnightbreakfast.com.Thank you for taking the time to check out Midnight Breakfast and for your support. It means the world to us.***The Personalized Postcards PerkInterested in our Personalized Postcards perk? Here's how it works:If you select the Personalized Postcards perk, you'll be matched, at random, with one of the writers listed below. If your donation's absolutely, 100% based on a specific writer on this list, upon completing your donation, you may email Rebecca Rubenstein at rebecca@midnightbreakfast.com and request that writer. We cannot make any guarantees, but we'll do our best, and donors who specify will be matched on a first-come, first-serve basis. (To increase your chances of getting a postcard from the writer of your choice, donors who choose to email may send a list of up to 5 names. Please include your own name in the email. This perk is also transferable, so you can pay it forward and gift it to someone else, if you'd like.) If you do not wish to email and would like to be surprised, all the more power to you; every single writer on this list is amazing, and we would be thrilled to get a personalized postcard from ALL of them.The following writers are participating in our Personalized Postcards perk: Our brilliant Issue Zero contributors Kima Jones, Jason Diamond, Matthew Salesses, Lauren O'Neal, Benjamin Samuel, and Eric Anthony Glover. We also have the participation of such excellent literary minds as: Rick Moody, Chris Abani, Jami Attenberg, Roxane Gay, Lincoln Michel, Megan Abbott, Saeed Jones, Yiyun Li, Jerry Stahl, Elissa Schappell, Gina Frangello, Isaac Fitzgerald, Ron Currie, Jr., Peter Orner, Laura van den Berg, Elliott Holt, Matt Bell, Maud Newton, Michele Filgate, David Gutowski, Melissa Febos, Owen King, Steve Almond, Joshua Mohr, Conner Habib, Wendy C. Ortiz, Ashley Ford, Sari Botton, Kelly Luce, Jonathan Lee, Erika Anderson, Julia Fierro, Sean Carman, and Alexander Chee.  ***Where'd the Thank You perk go? Because we're only allowed to list X amount of perks at one time, we had to remove this one from the campaign page to make way for our very exciting Web Design Consultation perk. But worry not! If you'd like to donate and simply receive a hearty thanks from us on the site, it's still possible. Just donate by clicking on the pink Contribute Now button, then shoot us an email at hello@midnightbreakfast.com to let us know that you've ""selected"" the Thank You perk, and we'll make sure you get your dues. Even if you can only give $1, we'll love you forever, and we definitely want to be sure to thank everyone! (Also, we'll still hug you if we see you!)***Speaking of which...A huge thanks to everyone who donated their time and resources to give us the incredible selection of perks we have to offer.Our campaign video was made with the help of so many individuals. We'd like to thank Adam Stepinski, for directing and editing, as well as the participation of the literary rock stars featured in the video itself: Isaac Fitzgerald, Brian Spears, Jill Meyers & Callie Collins, Oscar Villalon, Colin Winnette, Seth Fischer & Ashley Perez, Lisa Lucas, Lauren Eggert-Crowe, Zoë Ruiz, J. Ryan Stradal, Cat Richardson, and Lauren O'Neal.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Hi, my name is Evie.</p>
<p>I came late to my creativity, not taking myself seriously until I was in my early thirties. It was then that I realised why I'd always felt out of step with the rest of the world. But once the penny dropped, that was it. I began to create with a fever that has stayed with me for the last 15 years. </p>
<p>I paint, write, sew and photoshop images, sometimes I do all these things together. </p>
<p>I have become successful with my work in my home country, but the market here is very small so financial success has not followed the recognition.</p>
<p>Two years ago I published my first full length novel with a small indie publishing company called Evernight. I am working on novel two in the series, but am struggling to find the time to devote to it, because the need to support my family takes too much from me.</p>
<p>I'm hoping to raise funds that will allow me to give the second book in my series all the time and attention it deserves. The first book took me three years to write because I had to squeeze it in around the edges. It would mean so much to me to be able to just write, to give all my creative energy to this project and to see my characters birthed into the world.</p>
<p>The first book in my series has recieved rave reviews. I have included some of the highlights for you to look at if you like.</p>
<p><span>As far as debut novels go, this is by far one of the best.</span></p>
<p>All and all, Lunacy and the Vampire is a great read, though kind slow moving at first, it has a truly action packed ending. Fans of Krestley Cole's Immortals After Dark series', with definitely enjoy taking a crack at this. I for one am looking forward to reading more books from the realm of the Dominion.</p>
<p>Rating : 4 stars</p>
<p>Nocturne Romance Reads Reviews</p>
<p>This book was so good, I can't tell which part I liked best.It had action and romance and sex and everything one can expect from a good paranormal book, including some great world building and a strong-headed heroine who is a ""beanne sidhe huntress"" very deadly and set to kill vampires in order to protect humanity.</p>
<p>The only thing that doesn't make this book justice is the cover, but as we all know one shouldn't judge by it. This one is a keeper, can't wait for Dominion #2.</p>
<p>Rating: 5 stars</p>

<p>Lunacy and the Vampire is filled with characters that evolve from the beginning of the story until the end. A true example of the other side of a coin, from hate to love and the fine line between may not stem the tide. I love the storyline and Luna’s pain is apparent with every word. The final battle and ending will take the reader’s breath away.</p>

<p>Highly Recommended Read! Don't miss out!</p>
<p>The author took a complex concept, and did a great job of painting an intriguing world around it. It’s not your everyday vampire story, which now days, is a good thing. I loved the idea of the quickening for bringing forth the beating of long silent hearts. There’s something hauntingly poetic about that, but don’t get me wrong, the characters in the book are warriors, bad-ass for sure.</p>
<p>All in all, the book was thought provoking, steamy, gritty, action-packed, and well done. I hope to be reading more from this talented author</p>

<p>I. Loved. It.</p>
<p>I really hope that we get to see more books in this world with these characters. These are not your childhood fairies. There are gruesome, dark, evil fae. And the good fae are ass kicking, name taking soldiers for the cause. The vampires are not sweet and sparkly. They are vicious, brutal warriors. This book is not for the faint of heart. If you are looking for a romantic vampire/fairy story, move it along. If you want a gritty, down and dirty, action filled story of destiny and love that defies all odds, then THIS is the book you need to read.</p>

</div></div>","STRETCH GOAL -- $125,000!We are so very happy we made our initial goal, but we have so much more to do. Help us reach and record for prosperity great leaders of peace around the world for the Living History experience.  We recently met with the revered South African social activist, Archbishop Desmond Tutu -- see his comments below:




The Dalai Lama Foundation is thrilled to develop the Living History of the Dalai Lama -- the world's first and only comprehensive online interactive history highlighting the Dalai Lama's lifelong journey to advance the cause of world peace.





****  SPECIAL OFFER  ****     TICKETS TO SEE THE DALAI LAMA IN 2015 !
All contributors making donations between now and the end of the campaign on Wednesday, December 3, will be automatically entered in a random drawing to win two tickets to see His Holiness the Dalai Lama during his tour of the United States in 2015.  Travel and accommodations are not included, and the date and location of the event will be determined after the Dalai Lama releases his 2015 itinerary.  See our Updates for more details. 



The Dalai Lama is one of the most recognizable leaders and advocates for world peace.  Among his many honors and awards, 25 years ago, he won the Nobel Peace Prize.  His commitment to selfless contribution in support of peaceful coexistence is an inspiration to millions of people around the world.  And now, the Living History project will bring the words and actions of this extraordinary man to future generations.
This project, and the efforts of the Dalai Lama Foundation, which the Dalai Lama has endorsed, promise to put into action many of the ideas for peace supported by His Holiness.



“I welcome all those who will join us…in our efforts to advance the cause of genuine peace in the world.”
                                                                                - Tenzin Gyatso, the 14th Dalai Lama






The Living History will include:



A website portal that brings the experience of the Dalai Lama directly to you, whereever you are located.

A chronological presentation of the major events in the Dalai Lama's extraordinary life.

An interactive map showing the many places around the world that the Dalai Lama has visited and spread his message of peace.

A searchable data base of rarely seen videos and photos of the Dalai Lama, as well as his speeches, talks and writings.

Success stories of people, groups and organizations that were inspired by the Dalai Lama.

A community where users can share stories, as well as post photos and videos through their social media.

As His Holiness approaches his 80th birthday, we know that now is the time to create the Living History. 



Tenzin Tethong, former Prime Minister to the Central Tibetan Administration 



Thupten Jinpa, principal English translator to the Dalai Lama


Paul Blackthorne, television and screen actor




Your Generosity Makes the Difference.We cannot accomplish our goal of creating the Living History of the Dalai Lama without your support.  Please join the many friends of the Dalai Lama and contribute generously.



Gingger Shankar, Grammy nominated musician


Peter Coyote, screen actor and Buddhist scholar

The money raised in this campaign will be used to create the Living History.  If we raise amounts over our goal, we will enhance the interactive content, and produce an even more exciting and complete experience.  In the event that we are fortunate to raise more than we can use for the Living History, we can start to advance several other goals, including our Incubator for Peace: a program for social entrepreneurs to collaborate and further their organizations' advocacy of peace.

I been in community leadership all of my life. But I have been working in the LGBT community since 2008. I have been an event promoter, a community organizer and burgeoning political figure dedicated to positive visibility of LGBT people especially Masculine of Center Womyn. <br/><br/>I'm also a writer. I have been writing since I was 9 years old. For me writing stories has always been easy for me because they wee simply me writing down my daydreams. I got my BA and MFA in Creative Writing. When I came out I started writing more and more stories about my experience as a black lesbian. But one day my non-fiction side took over and I started a blog. My blog was a daily journey through my life and the music follows me and my experiences. I always got such a great response from the community about my blog posts that I decided to compile them into a book. Glover Lane Press loved my writing and agreed to publish the book. ""Knockturnal Emissions: Thoughts on #race #sexuality #gender #community"" was born!<br/><br/>My book has brought such joy into my life. It has given me a platform to start conversations in places I never thought I would be.  Funding this campaign would mean I would get to go into even more places in other states and talk about my experience as a Black, Masculine of Center, Lesbian Womyn. It would also mean that I would get to produce my next book which will be my first published fiction piece. It is a collection of linked short stories that centers around a lesbian rapper. The books is structured like an album and the stories live inside of the songs. I am very excited and the stories are already generating buzz as I read them at open mics.<br/> <br/><p>Carolyn's Bio</p><p>
</p><p>Carolyn
Wysinger is 30 something soft butch raised in Richmond, Ca.<span>  She is a social entrepreneur whose goal is to
build bridges within our community which extend out into society at large. She
is an educator, activist, writer and event coordinator. She earned her B.A. in
English from California State University, Long Beach and her M.F.A. from
Antioch University. </span></p>
<p><span>  Her desire to advocate for social
justice started at an early age in school government and church leadership. As
an adult she learned how to use those same tools to build within the LGBT
community.  She has made her presence
felt in the community through promoting social events and volunteer
work/workshops at conferences and retreats such as BUTCHVoices and Black
Lesbians United.  She is a contributor to
the Queer Women of Color Media Wire and she is proud that her first book
“Knockturnal Emissions: Thoughts on #race #sexuality #gender &amp; #community”
was recently published in Glover Lane Press. Her goal is to create new things
and be able to say she left this world better than she found it.</span></p>
<br/><p></p><p></p><h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>Money raised through this campaign will travel and expenses for promo stops in<br/>     -Atlanta <br/>     -Los Angeles<br/>     -Portland<br/>     -Houston<br/>And other possible areas<br/>      Las Vegas<br/>      East Coast<br/> In each of these cities I will be doing a promotional even as well as community retreats &amp;/or trainings that will extend my activist work in the community.<br/><br/>The public has demanded that I hurry up and release this fiction book that I am always reading from. So money raised will also go to production costs of the next fiction book with the working title ""A Day in the Life...""<br/><br/>I would LOVE if you would contribute even just a little bit. But if you can't I understand. I just ask that you tweet, FB share, IG screen shot this to evvveryone you know!! The more participation we get the more we send out the message that QPOC stories matter! That we have a voice and it needs to be heard!!! If I raised all of this on multitudes of $25 contributions that would still be awesome because that shows a huge mass of people looking for these stories!!!     <br/><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><br/></p></div>","Hello, My name is Carolyn Wysinger and I get high off the community like Fed Hampton Jr...I love the people, I love serving the community.

It has given me a platform to start conversations in places I never thought I would be.  Funding this campaign would mean I would get to go into even more places in other states and talk about my experience as a Black, Masculine of Center, Lesbian Womyn. It would also mean that I would get to produce my next book which will be my first published fiction piece. It is a collection of linked short stories that centers around a lesbian rapper. The books is structured like an album and the stories live inside of the songs. I am very excited and the stories are already generating buzz as I read them at open mics. Carolyn's Bio
Carolyn
Wysinger is 30 something soft butch raised in Richmond, Ca.  She is a social entrepreneur whose goal is to
build bridges within our community which extend out into society at large. She
is an educator, activist, writer and event coordinator. She earned her B.A. in
English from California State University, Long Beach and her M.F.A. from
Antioch University. 
  Her desire to advocate for social
justice started at an early age in school government and church leadership. As
an adult she learned how to use those same tools to build within the LGBT
community.  She has made her presence
felt in the community through promoting social events and volunteer
work/workshops at conferences and retreats such as BUTCHVoices and Black
Lesbians United.  She is a contributor to
the Queer Women of Color Media Wire and she is proud that her first book
“Knockturnal Emissions: Thoughts on #race #sexuality #gender & #community”
was recently published in Glover Lane Press. Her goal is to create new things
and be able to say she left this world better than she found it.
What We Need & What You GetMoney raised through this campaign will travel and expenses for promo stops in     -Atlanta      -Los Angeles     -Portland     -HoustonAnd other possible areas      Las Vegas      East Coast In each of these cities I will be doing a promotional even as well as community retreats &/or trainings that will extend my activist work in the community.The public has demanded that I hurry up and release this fiction book that I am always reading from. So money raised will also go to production costs of the next fiction book with the working title ""A Day in the Life...""I would LOVE if you would contribute even just a little bit. But if you can't I understand. I just ask that you tweet, FB share, IG screen shot this to evvveryone you know!! The more participation we get the more we send out the message that QPOC stories matter! That we have a voice and it needs to be heard!!! If I raised all of this on multitudes of $25 contributions that would still be awesome because that shows a huge mass of people looking for these stories!!!",0.0,0,"4 Campaigns

We all had varying backgrounds---some of us M.F.A. and Ph.D. candidates, some on the spoken word tour circuit, some closet poets; however, all of us were searching to fill a void. We needed a community of poets who understood the cultural framework of our work; who could breakdown Plato, Roger Bonair-Agard, and Biggie in the same breath; who believed in the power of a united writing community; and who were passionate about getting our voices into the world as a team. We were starved for a <b><i>craft-oriented poetry community of color</i></b>.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">We all also had issues accessing poetry communities of color that did exist for two major reasons: either they were way too expensive (high tuition, airfare, hotel, and time off from work and family), or they didn't stress the importance of craft and revision.</p>

We have already secured the retreat space and facilitators, and we have numerous poets who are dedicated to our mission. All we need are the funds to make it happen.</p>

Who We Are
The Watering Hole is a grassroots movement that began as a Facebook Group created by fellows of Cave Canem South Workshops. We all had varying backgrounds---some of us M.F.A. and Ph.D. candidates, some on the spoken word tour circuit, some closet poets; however, all of us were searching to fill a void. We needed a community of poets who understood the cultural framework of our work; who could breakdown Plato, Roger Bonair-Agard, and Biggie in the same breath; who believed in the power of a united writing community; and who were passionate about getting our voices into the world as a team. We were starved for a craft-oriented poetry community of color.
We all also had issues accessing poetry communities of color that did exist for two major reasons: either they were way too expensive (high tuition, airfare, hotel, and time off from work and family), or they didn't stress the importance of craft and revision.
We draw much of our inspiration from those three-day Cave Canem South workshops, which were hosted by Dr. Kwame Dawes, editor of Prairie Schooner; and led by Nikky Finney, a National Book Award winner; Patricia Smith, who was inducted into the International Literary Hall of Fame for Writers of African Descent; and Frank X Walker, co-founder of the Affrilachian Poets.
What We Need & What You Get
We need incorporation and non-profit status in order to be able to access arts grants, which could fuel our initiatives for the next decade and more. That would help us keep retreats and online master classes affordable and accessible for all of our participants, better support our facilitators, and finally, finally, finally be able to provide scholarships, as well.  
We're grateful for any level of support. Whether you donate $5 or $5,000, every donation allows us to apply for arts grants and say that x number of people believe in The Watering Hole and have a personal investment in our growth and future. The larger the number of contributors is, the better our grant applications look.
If we're able to raise $5,000, we'll be able to pay the fees for incorporation and non-profit status, respectfully support our world-class retreat facilitators, and bring in special a guest speaker at the retreat.
$8,000: Historical fieldtrip with guided tour at the retreat, free tote bags, and other swag for all retreat participants, plus 5 partial need-based scholarships will awarded
$10,000: Select sessions will be recorded, so that retreat participants can access them when they leave and TWH members who aren't able to attend can access them, as well. Plus, 10 partial need-based scholarships will awarded.
We have fantastic perks, including seats in Online Master Classes, Laptop/Notebook Stickies (pictured below), journal subscriptions, Brand New T-shirts, autographed book bundles, scholarship donations, even manuscript critiques. We even have a sponsorship option for those who would like to promote a business.

The Impact

The Watering Hole is growing from the 3-day winter retreat we hosted in 2013 to a 6-day retreat at the end of this year, December 26-31. It's what our members have been asking for. Our goal is to keep the retreat price below $50 per day for classes, workshops, and lodging. This is unheard of! Retreat participants will have more time with the facilitators, more focused attention from one facilitator in particular, more time to write away from the responsibilities and distractions of home, and most of all more time with each other. The camaraderie among participants is, in our experience, the most transformative part of a writer's retreat. 
This is why we need incorporation and non-profit status. We have a notebook full of ideas for building an affordable and accessible poetry community--a safe space where poets of color can learn and grow. Consistent funding through arts grants could support those initiatives and offset the cost for our members.
Risks & Challenges With any movement this large and this grassroots, there are always logistical challenges. If we don't reach our goal of $5,000, we are determined to still continue with our winter retreat and continue working towards achieving incorporation and non-profit status. This will simply involve strict cutbacks. We are find-a-way poets, who have a history of achieving the seemingly unachievable. We are experienced, impassioned, and able to handle all situations. We have already secured the retreat space and facilitators, and we have numerous poets who are dedicated to our mission. All we need are the funds to make it happen.

<p>Have you ever wanted to make a real difference in this world? One that will change people’s lives not only now, but for generations? Have you been looking for a campaign to support that truly makes a lasting difference? Here is your chance! The Institute for Self Reliant Agriculture (SRA) is a non-profit 501(c)3 organization that is focused on helping end hunger and malnutrition in the developing world.  We are a trusted Guidestar Exchange partner!</p>
<p><a href=""http://www.guidestar.org/organizations/27-1213552/institute-self-reliant-agriculture.aspx"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.guidestar.org/organizations/27-1213552/institute-self-reliant-agriculture.aspx</a></p>
<p>SRA has been in Operation since 2009 and is working with Governments, Universities and other NGO's in an effort to combine our abilities and help as many people feed themselves and emerge from poverty as possible.</p>
<p>Currently, we have several projects we are working on. In cooperation with the Government of Piura and the National University of Peru, we are creating a new program that will benefit over 600 families (over 3,000 individuals- the largest portion are children) in the city of Huarmaca, Peru, a very poor region of the country. They currently have malnutrition rates as high as 80%. We have other programs in Ecuador and Kenya, and we are working on helping as many families as we can. You can get more information about each of our programs on our website. <a href=""http://www.feedtheworld.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.feedtheworld.org</a></p>
<p>Before the age of 5, children are most vulnerable to debilitating disease and permanent damage from malnutrition. We have been working with a limited number of families and have been able to reduce malnutrition rates by over 30% in the first year! Many government programs have not been able to achieve 1/10th of that reduction with many years of work. This is a chance to save the lives and futures of thousands of children!</p>
<p>These programs require donations in order to achieve success. With your support, we can make a difference which will last many lifetimes!</p>
<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<p>Our goal is a multi-phase program to raise $100,000 as our contribution toward the program. As soon as we are able to do that, the Government of Piura will contribute and additional $500,000 dollars toward the program. This first phase ($15,000) will be used to help qualify over 600 families that will take part in the program, have a nutritiontist and agronimist teach the first set of classes and will provide the initial set of quality seeds for their first planting.</p>
<p>You can get a better idea of how unique we really are in our approach to helping families and why our program is so badly needed, by visiting our website.</p>
<p>As a thank you for your support, we have put together some incredible, once in a lifetime perks! How would you like to be able to see first-hand the progress we are making and the power of your support? There are two perks that will give you that incredible experience!</p>
<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<p>We have learned that the best way to pull people out of hunger and poverty is not by giving them food, but by empowering them to solve their own problems. We have developed a program called the Small Scale Agriculture Model which has been in development for 25 years. This program is so basic and effective that we literally have many governments, Universities and other Non-profits wanting to partner with us to implement our model in their programs. We have found that by growing people as much as we grow food, we help people solve their own problems. </p>

I come from a family that does not pass judgement on you because of your Race, Gender, or Religion and  until recent I've had the pleasure of getting to know people outside their normal whom we know as LGTB.  For the most part i had never put any thought into what others did with their lives until I heard the story about Co-KO a A young Trans Gendered Woman murdered because of her gender.  Upon reading the story, a friend of mine knew Co-KO personally and had told me about a close friend of Co-KO's that almost experienced the same ordeal, but escaped from harms way and lived to tell the story her name is Lisa, Lisa Cole a 28 year old Trans Gendered female that did not want to go public with her ordeals in fear that this guy has not been caught and still fears for her life to this very day.   Although Lisa still remained traumatized from her ordeal, she entrusted in me to write her story to inform people to make better decisions and to know what and who they are getting their selves into a relationship with.

What We Need & What You Get
My mission on Indiegogo is to raise 8,000 for the
Editing, Publishing, and Distribution, and Promotion
Book Launch celebration along with candle light gathering with food and fun.
Book tour to California Northern and Southern, Texas, Chicago and several Midwest States.
The Impact

I believe this would have a monumental impact on the LGTB community if we continue to make progress on our goals on society not allowing what others say or feel about us make a difference.  To write fiction is pretty easy, but to write about something as serious as this is matter is takes a lot of having compassion for people a whole.Other Ways You Can Help

</div> <h4><b>Hello!</b></h4>
<p>My name is Korina, I am from Greece and I am a Medical Doctor. My life was never easy as until 19 years old my life was full of abuse. At 17 years old have tried to run away from home but they have found me with police's help and the abuse was even more. At 19 I left home in order to study and my life started to get better.</p>
<p>All this abuse since the age of 2 years old, has made me to find refuge in imagination, which has lead me to have the idea of the Magic Book and the Magic Project. </p>
<p>Also the thing that i had so much abuse, made me to want to fight violence and abuse wherever I see it. So when I first worked as a doctor in a prison and saw how the prisoners are treated, I made denunciations at Strasburg at the department of human rights of prisoners. This was equal to me making denunciations for the Greek ministry of health and ministry of justice. Ofc the ""system"" has turned against me and they had me to go through a court with the fake accusation that a prisoner has died bc of one pill that I gave to him, while he died from Heroine. Thank God, even If it was all set up and even if I had no money for lawyer and I had to interrogate the witnesses by myself, the result was that I AM INNOCENT (is a big story how the truth shined). You can imagine that this has lead to receive a very bad attitude from the classical medical communities in my country which has become even worse when I started to treat autism WITH BIG SUCCESS through the antidoting of vaccines. Ofc this is by default a proof that autism comes from vaccines, if i can treat the autism by antidoting the vaccines right? So you can imagine the result...</p>
<p>Is like there is an open ""war"" going on from that classical medical communities which explains how a medical alternative doctor can be very very poor. </p>
<p>You see, they ""arranged"" not to be able to have patients from my area but working hard on writting articles on Facebook about my work, testimonies from my patients etc helped me to have some patients through skype from other cities and from other countries. Is hard to continue writing my book through this situation because I spend a lot of hours on phone, skype with my patients and even more hours to write continiously articles about my work in order to get people to know me. (No money for proper advertising).</p>
<p>But I learned that we must NOT GIVE UP and also with the help of the book ""THE SCHOOL FOR GODS"" of Stefano Elio D' Anna, I learned that the only real thing that exists is the dream. I started to dream bigger and bigger and now the dream has no limits anymore, so the idea of the Magic Project was born 1,5 month ago.</p>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">Everyone says that the Magic Project is a huge dream/goal which cant come true. I believe the opposite and I want to show to people of the whole world that </span><b style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">we STILL HAVE THE RIGHT TO DREAM</b><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">, no matter what financial crisis, or obstacles we experience in our lives.</span><br/></p>
<p>We can still remain pure in hearts and in behaviour, we can still do whatever we think is the best for us and the people around us and DREAM....Dream Big!</p>
<p>You will see that for now I ask money only to be able to finish writing my book, translating it, publishing it, and to be able to have nice gifts for my backers.</p>

<div>In order to do that I think that 5-6 months from the moment that i will take the funding will be enough (right now is written the 1/4 of the book but no time not even for corrections etc bc I have to focus on having money to survive) so I think that an amount of 6000 euros for that will be ok.</div>

<div><b>3. Publication in Greek</b></div>
<div>For 500 books the cheapest price I found at a non so good publications service is 8000 euros +VAT</div>
<div><b>4. Publication in English</b></div>

Even with an extremely supportive family doing the best they can to support me. I am not an only child and with my mother living with Multiple Sclerosis is unable to work, we are a single income family. So I am left to reach out and ask for any extra support in order to make this happen.This is a list of the approximate funds I will need:Return flight: $1300 CANChristmas camp: $1050 CAN (plus food)Spain project: $1000 CAN  (includes all transportation)Worlds camp: $900 CAN  (plus food)National team clothing: $505Short sleeve & long sleeve jerseySkin-suitBib shortsWind vestSocksT-shirt This is why I am asking and am in need of your help to support to make this trip possible.

And the APRIL Festival always culminates with a Book Expo on the last day, hosting small presses from near and far, from the tiny handmade houses to the biggest of the little guys, which gives folks in Seattle and the surrounding area the opportunity to encounter this incredible work in person, speak to publishers directly, while simultaneously allowing small press publishers to gain audiences they might not otherwise reach.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1443637830/f7i7pdwel4ccp1cza2rb.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p>Here are just a few of the writers and publishers we have hosted over the last few years:</p><br/><p>Graywolf, Octopus Books, Dzanc Books, Shya Scanlon, Wendy Xu, Big Fiction, Jac Jemc, Mike Young, Scrambler Books, Michelle Penaloza, Elissa Washuta, Pacifica Literary Review, The Shipping Group, Two Sylvias Press, Matthew Simmons, Future Tense, Lauren Ireland, Magic Helicopter, Matthew Rohrer, Sasquatch Books, Wave Books, Coffee House Press, Matthew Dickman, Minor Arcana Press, Rebecca Brown, Peter Mountford, Heather Christle, Chin Music Press, Emily Kendal Frey, PageBoy Magazine, Yeti Press Comics, Jai-Alai Books, Short Flight/Long Drive, Dorothy</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1443637842/cl9iuqnlsapffc4y1jla.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p>APRIL Press</p><br/><p><a href=""http://www.thestranger.com/seattle/2013-literature-genius-award-finalists/Content?oid=16948095"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">""They combine up-and-coming local talent with brilliant out-of-town authors and put on events that get copied by other, inferior arts organizations.

Our Mission
APRIL’s mission is to connect readers with independent literature and the authors and publishers of this vitalizing work
Our Vision
As motivation for our programming, APRIL envisions:

an increase in readers seeking out writing that is new and pertinent to them—writing that takes chances in both publication and performance and has greater potential for relevance in their lives;
readers actively reconsidering their definition of literature, its forms and its position in the arts;
independent literary producers—authors, publishers and writers of all kinds—thriving, with increased publicity and heightened reader engagement;
a reading public connecting as a more interactive social body—one that encourages creation and collaboration.

APRIL Values

literature as an indispensable element of our shared culture;
writing that takes risks, strikes out on a new path, negotiates from its own rubric, and speaks to a greater need;
the multiplicity of today’s literary arts–how literature manifests itself in books, online, hand-crafted chapbooks, zines, collaborative writing projects, conceptual readings, interpretive performances, and more;
creative possibility as a quality that sustains the literary arts and encourages growth;
unique, personal, and meaningful literary experiences that feed enthusiasm and promote active engagement and literacy;
communication as a crucial and gratifying element of human interaction.

<h3>Sigurd is Strength</h3>
<p>Thor, Woden, Indra, Perun, Arthur, Aragorn<i>, </i>Robin Hood, Volsung, <i>Sigurd</i>...what do these heroes and gods have in common? What do all heroes have in common?

We lift heavy stuff, we wrestle, we fight, we make bonds of brotherhood, we eat pork, drink mead and fuck maidens, but above all we see the power and mystery of the myth and its recurrent influence on our daily lives.</p>

<p>This book has been in the making for a thousand years, the men of old knew its truths, but they are truths which have been lost or obscured, hidden in the recesses of the minds of the peasants. </p>
<p>Men tested each other once, in the name of Thor and thunder gods around the world, they lifted heavy stuff, sang songs of old heroes, shared their food and wine, wrestled and danced together under the immoveable stars. </p>

<li>We need £250-£500 to produce a good healthy first run of the Sigurd Book</li>

<h3>A Spark in Dry Wood</h3>
<p>For millennia across the world martial cultures invoked the name of their gods and heroes to challenge death itself. A hero was made by his people and the people around him. He ate, drank and lived within the era in which he was born, but his soul and his name would live forever. </p>
<p>The dry tinder of our spiritual stagnation has now come to an end, across the world people feel the need for a spiritual rebirth, a reawakening of what it means to be a warrior, to be strong, to be loud and defiant in protection of what you hold dear.</p>
<ul>
<li>The Book of the Heroic Outlaw is but the first step in a long line of projects which the founders have in store</li>
<li>We are a transparent and earthy people, our goal is the re-wilding of our souls, not just the immersion in old ways and customs, but the invoking of old ways and customs in a new light, the light of the dawning Aeon</li>

Drink, make merry, celebrate your life and sing the old songs in the old ruins of the old temples.</li>
<li>You can share all of this information with the people around you, invoke your god, become a living archetype in memory of who you once were, let Indra ride roughshod over the stagnant pools of your self-doubt, awaken Agni, ignite!</li>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>In 2005, I enlisted in the United States Marine Corps. I was unwortrhy to join such an elite group. I was sent to the Physical Conditioning platoon, where nightmares awaited. There, no training takes place. No schedules, no nothing. So the Drill Instructor gets to do whatever he wants. We would be punished at random every single day for the majority of our day. I've witnessed many a suicide there, and those melancholy faces still haunt me today.</p>
<p>The funds reveived would help me market this book I lived, and tell the story of those who didn't survive that platoon. It will honor them, and their loved ones. People need to hear this inspiring true story.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I would fund it myself, but I work at a low income job and I have a wife and three kids to support. Subsequently, that idea is out the window. That's why I launched this campaign. Every little bit helps. The funds will go directly into a bank account opened under my book's title, and that money will be used solely for marketing the book, and setting up events for it in different cities. </p>
<p>$1 donation= A special thanks on my fan page</p>
<p>$5 donation= A free copy of the book, and a special thanks on my fan page</p>
<p>$10 donation= Everything above, plus an autographed book poster</p>
<p>$25 donation= Everything above, and a short story written for you of whatever you would like</p>
<p>$35 donation= Everything above, including a song about you written by Ian Suhovy of The Jacktones</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>So far, I have starred in several films, all scheduled to be released in the near future. Other writings of mine have been published in various books since high school, but none this insightful. many veterans write about war. That's been done over and over. I wanted to be different, so I chose a specific time in boot camp, where I found redemption, and became what I aspired to be. In war, there is no redemption, trust me I've done it. </p>
<p>People have reviewed this book, saying ""it changed their life"", and I want to make sure that everybody has the chance to read it, and possibly change their lives as well.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>I understand if you simply can't make a donation. That's OK with me. You can still help by sharing this link. The more people who see it, the better chances the book has to be recognized. Thank you so much for your consideration. I truly appreciate it.</p>

It's a two-year position (2015-2017), and I am only the second person to hold it. Here’s the unfortunate thing: the UP Poet Laureate is a completely grassroots endeavor, which means <b>NO FUNDING</b> comes with the position. That's right: no grant money or stipend or piggy bank of coins. </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">So in order to do the fun things I want to do over the next two years, I need YOUR help!</span><br/></p>
<p><b>How will
your donations be used?</b> To help support poetry projects across Michigan’s Upper
Peninsula over the next two years. I want to use the Poet Laureate-ship to help get poetry onto the streets and
trails and into people’s everyday lives. </p>
<p>Here's just one of my projects:
my friend and amazing builder Scotty Allen is building a mobile Free Little
Poetry Library using UP materials like cedar shakes! The idea behind the
Free Little Library movement is to bring libraries out into the world and make
their books more accessible. You walk by on the way to the grocery, you see a book you like, you take it home, and maybe you come back
and donate a book later! Our Free Little Poetry Library will be stocked full of
POETRY and will be mobile so I can load it into my Blue Subaru and set it up
in different locations across the UP. The Free Little Poetry Library will launch in Marquette on June 20 as part of Art Week, and then continue to spread poetry love across the UP the rest of the summer. </p><p>And did you say beer? I thought you did! How about a Poetry Hop-ping Tour with poets reading at the myriad local breweries across the UP?! Stay tuned for Summer 2016. <br/></p>
<p>And then
there are less glamorous things like purchasing food for poetry receptions and
printing fliers and gas money to fuel my adventures across the UP— DO YOU KNOW HOW
BIG THE UP IS? <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upper_Peninsula_of_Michigan"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">16,377 square miles, according to Wikipedia</a>. Or about 300 miles
long and 100 miles wide. That’s a lot of ground to cover. And I would love to be able to carbon offset my Poet Laureate travels so that spreading poetry doesn't needlessly harm the environment. One 120 mile roundtrip--say from Marquette to the Escanaba Public Library where I'll be doing a reading in September--can be offset with your $15 donation! </p>
<p><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Two years of poetry projects + zero funding = your help needed! </b></p><p>Once you factor in the Free Little Poetry Library building cost ($400), the reading and reception to honor the outgoing UP Poet Laureate <a href=""http://russthorburn.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Russell Thorburn</a> ($150), flier printing and distribution costs ($100 for each event), gas money ($2.50 a gallon X 30 miles per gallon = a lot of gas money). . . well, you can see where this is going.

<h3>So what is Grim, anyway?</h3>
<p>Grim is a brand new horror magazine published by rabid female horror fans: it includes essays, reviews, analyses, interviews, humour content, and short fiction contributed by a variety of talented and enthusiastic writers. We especially want to showcase the voices of women, POC and LGBTQ+ people -- our first issue celebrated women in horror (and was released during Women in Horror month, naturally!)</p>
<p>Grim is the first digital magazine project by anatomyofascream.com. This ongoing crowdfunding campaign will help cover the costs of producing the magazine. </p>
<p> </p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<ul>
<li>We are truly grateful for every donation or pledge we get -- every dollar goes towards the costs of publishing the magazine</li>
<li>In exchange for their much-appreciated help, donors will be given perks including early access to the digital magazine and copies of the print magazine (and maybe even stickers!)</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<ul>
<li>With Grim, we want to promote the voices of women and LGBTQ+ folks in the horror community, which has had a reputation for being a boy's club. We think that we offer some great perspectives on the films that we all love!</li>
<li>We want to interview and profile women who work in film, from producers to directors to composers to makeup artists and more! </li>
<li>We want to offer new analyses and frameworks through which to appreciate the horror genre, shifting perspectives and deepening understandings!</li>
</ul>
</div><div><h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3></div><div>
<p>We know that money is tight for a lot of us (hence this campaign existing in the first place). Maybe you just can't contribute -- that's totally okay!

My name is <strong>Michael Tullberg</strong>, and I’m one of the longest-running electronic music photojournalists in North America.

</div></span></div>","Short Summary 






Join me in helping 1,000 of our nation’s neediest youth conquer the mindset that poverty often brings, all while getting into the success mindset to achieve your goals at the same time!
I'm Andrew McDonald, author, speaker, and founder of my company Possess Your Success, which helps helps those in high school, college, and beyond to achieve success in their personal development goals.

The youth I’m targeting don’t often have the loving environment at home that some experience. They don’t have people telling them that they can achieve their goals.
And certainly, no one is breaking down the exact steps they need to take to reach their goals in simple language that is easy to understand and implement. 
I've seen the results firsthand--in my own family, in fact--of the unfortunate decisions and actions of misguided youth. I'm committed to ensuring these students find a better way to live their lives and possess their success with my upcoming book, Possess Your Success: Mastering the Limitless Success Method.

   Why do we need this money?




 There are a lot of costs that go into creating a well designed, inspiring book like Possess Your Success. Luckily, we know how to stretch a dollar! The best thing is that I’ve contributed my energy free of charge to collect the research and write the 10 chapter book. I’ve completed the book and the manuscript is already ready for print!
Your money will also contribute to the funds we already have to help cover:  inspiring 1,000 of our nation’s neediest high school youth across the nation with a message of inspiration by giving them a copy of Possess Your Success
creating two (2) $500 scholarships to rising seniors of the 2017 class for the school of their choice
collecting inspiring stories from the students who wish to submit an entry to our essay contest about how they've possessed their success using a certain chapter of my book
publication and book printing costs
distribution to the 1,000 youth across our nation, and
travel costs associated with speaking at the beneficiary schools

Anything collected beyond our goal will go toward providing even more books and scholarships to students, as well as compensating the many strategic partners who are donating their time and resources to this project.To give a copy of this book to 1,000 students across the nation, run a strong essay contest to get them engaged with the material, and to launch our national campaign, we need $15,000.   
The Impact
Why do we want to work with this population of our nation’s youth?

a.   The youth we’re targeting don’t often have the loving environment at home that many of us may have experienced.
b.   They don’t have people telling them that they can achieve their goals.
c.   And certainly, no one is breaking down the steps they need to take to reach their goals in simple language that is easy to understand and implement.
d.   It’s on us--me and you--to bring inspiration to these loving souls.

 
Will I want this book even if I’m a grown up and not in school?
The short answer--YES, absolutely!
Grace Conyers, CEO of Insanitek said this about my book:
“It's not often you find a motivational book that makes you want to stop reading and just start living your dream. Possess Your Success does just that while provoking “what if” thoughts and challenging you to be a better you.

Possess Your Success is perfect for any age group, and there are a lot of powerful life lessons for anyone who wants to get in the right frame of mind to achieve the things in your life.
Years of observation reveals that the secret to success is not a secret at all, but instead the result of deliberate actions and methods towards progress that the average person overlooks.
With this book, you’ll learn my 3-step method to perform beyond your limits and achieve your goals. I show you this remarkable process, how it works, and why it works.
This book also equips you with the tools necessary to fend off threats to your success, such as negative emotions, dream-killers, fear, and failure in a simple-to-understand manner.

<p>
</p>
<p>At Midsouth Sober Living, we believe
it’s a crucial part of achieving and maintaining long term sobriety. Since
2008, MSL has been providing sober living/transitional housing for people who
are new in recovery. Your donation will help provide new bed bug resistant frames, mattresses and bed linens to all residents in our three facilities.</p>
<p>Our nonprofit sober living houses have served more than 115 newly sober residents in the past twelve months, from all over Memphis and Shelby County and from all walks of life. We offer safe, affordable drug- and alcohol-free housing, helping our residents reduce the risk of relapse and remain on the path to
recovery. <br/></p>
<p>Your donation will help us ensure that every bed we offer is truly one where folks can rest assured.<br/></p>
</div> <div> <h3>A safe bed for the start of a recovery journey<br/>
</h3>
<p>Some of our bed frames are already great, ready to withstand years of use and any creepy-crawlies that might launch an attack. Others - well, they're really ticking time bombs, given the number of folks that move through our facilities and the return of bed bugs in growing numbers. <br/></p>
<p>None of our mattresses are designed to discourage these pests. Neither are our mattress covers or pillow cases.<br/></p>

</div></div>","A safe place to sleep – how important is it to your peace of mind?


At Midsouth Sober Living, we believe
it’s a crucial part of achieving and maintaining long term sobriety. Since
2008, MSL has been providing sober living/transitional housing for people who
are new in recovery. Your donation will help provide new bed bug resistant frames, mattresses and bed linens to all residents in our three facilities.
Our nonprofit sober living houses have served more than 115 newly sober residents in the past twelve months, from all over Memphis and Shelby County and from all walks of life. We offer safe, affordable drug- and alcohol-free housing, helping our residents reduce the risk of relapse and remain on the path to
recovery. 
Your donation will help us ensure that every bed we offer is truly one where folks can rest assured.
  A safe bed for the start of a recovery journey

Some of our bed frames are already great, ready to withstand years of use and any creepy-crawlies that might launch an attack. Others - well, they're really ticking time bombs, given the number of folks that move through our facilities and the return of bed bugs in growing numbers. 
None of our mattresses are designed to discourage these pests. Neither are our mattress covers or pillow cases.
We've already seen that bed bug infestations could potentially drain huge amounts of our time and money, which are precious resources to our small nonprofit. The more money we spend fighting these pests, the less money we have to spend on programs for our residents and growing our mission with new facilities.
To provide a safe bed from top to bottom will cost approximately $500. If the frame is already good to go, we need approximately $250 for the mattress and linens. Just the linens for one bed is approximately $100.

<h3>We love a good challenge</h3>
<p></p>
<p>Starting any new business is always an adventure. In the start-up world of the internet, there are so many new ideas, and it is challenging to stand out in the crowd. But here, we think, we have a unique advantage.There is no other news site, anywhere, dedicated to bringing you news from a woman's angle, every day of the week.<i> Not one.</i></p>
<p><i>Is there a need for such a site?</i> Based upon two years of market research and on our<i> actual experience online</i> over the past year, we can definitively say, ""Yes!""</p>
<p>Yes! Readers want more stories by women. Yes! Readers want more news about women. Yes! Readers frequent those sites that align with their personal interests and concerns more than any others. And yes! Readers want <b>garnetnews</b>!</p>
<p>We are passionate about what we are doing and see it not only as a successful business model but also as a powerful way to connect women with information, and with one another. Women are 51% of the population and represent 85% of consumer spending. It's time that we owned that reality in a tangible way.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<h3>Other ways you can help</h3>
<p>We would love for you to contribute, but if that isn't possible now, please spread the word. We are relying on you to help us take our fundraising to the next level! </p>
<p>Share our campaign on <b>Facebook</b>, or tweet if you <b>Twitter.</b> Use the hashtag, <b>#garnetnewslive</b> to spread the word about our campaign. Most of all, tell your family and friends. We intend to make a difference, but this is definitely going to take a village!</p>

Starting any new business is always an adventure. In the start-up world of the internet, there are so many new ideas, and it is challenging to stand out in the crowd. But here, we think, we have a unique advantage.There is no other news site, anywhere, dedicated to bringing you news from a woman's angle, every day of the week. Not one.
Is there a need for such a site? Based upon two years of market research and on our actual experience online over the past year, we can definitively say, ""Yes!""
Yes! Readers want more stories by women. Yes! Readers want more news about women. Yes! Readers frequent those sites that align with their personal interests and concerns more than any others. And yes! Readers want garnetnews!
We are passionate about what we are doing and see it not only as a successful business model but also as a powerful way to connect women with information, and with one another. Women are 51% of the population and represent 85% of consumer spending. It's time that we owned that reality in a tangible way.


Other ways you can help
We would love for you to contribute, but if that isn't possible now, please spread the word. We are relying on you to help us take our fundraising to the next level! 
Share our campaign on Facebook, or tweet if you Twitter. Use the hashtag, #garnetnewslive to spread the word about our campaign. Most of all, tell your family and friends. We intend to make a difference, but this is definitely going to take a village!

About the video

We owe our snazzy video appeal to the hard work of Paul Schlott, Vincent Oppecker, Michelle Bizzarro, Dustin Harrison-Atlas and David Berman, all of whom went above and beyond the call of duty.

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>My name is Leslie and I have been writing for many years. It is my passion. I really feel that my novel can change people's lives, and to make sense of all the things I had to go through in my life. Now that I am in the editing process I really need help to get it up and running! I am from the town of St.John's, Newfoundland and we really need some more local publications and a new generation of writers. <br/></p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>So many people spend thier lives trying to make sense of hardships, and Tanked outlines some of the hardest things one would have to go through from teenage years to adulthood. Tanked touches on drug addict parents, having to support onesself from a young age, having a drug problem of your own, abusive relationships, feeling like an outsider but ultimately overcoming circumstance to follow your dreams. So many people feel as if they are alone and it would be comforting in reading the novel and knowing you are not. Tanked is truly one of a kind and groundbreaking and would be a huge loss to the world to not come into print. This is what I meant to do and I really need some help!<br/></p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I have no other sources of funding. I am on a low income and I don't have a way to print copies of the novel to send to publishers, I don't have money for postage, for binding, copying...even a cup of coffee to keep me editing would be a big help. If I can raise even one dollar towards the publishing process I will truly feel blessed. I would be more than willing to email various excerpts from the novel if you are still not convinved. I am in an unfortuante circumstance since I have no transportation of even internet to promote my novel and I have limited connections as a first time writer. Books are my best friend and I know you probably feel the same. It is time for me to share my story, this won't happen without the support of the community both locally and abroad. Anything is appreciated so, so much!<br/></p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Please let your friends know about my campaign! Share this to Facebook, send out an email list, anything. I will do interviews. If you know anyone in publishing or any writers I would love to get in touch with them. Please keep this going! I love you all :) And thanks for the support!</p>

<i>Raging Queen </i>had two openings—one in the front, at the mouth of the
ship, and a smaller opening at the rear. The rear entrance had always been my
favorite. The passage was long and narrow, with a smooth finish. I am not the
largest of men, but even so it was always a tight fit, which made it quite the
experience. It was as if, as I entered her, she was squeezing me tight, willing
me never to let me go. </p>
<p>I
ran my hands along her through the length of her corridor, fingering her
delicately in a loving embrace. My <i>Raging Queen </i>moved up and down
underneath me in undulating waves, almost shuddering under my touch. She
creaked and moaned, screamed and gyrated, and though she was for now under the
control of my seamen, it was I, only I, whose every order she followed. She
submitted to me first, always to me, and I liked it that way. </p>
<p>Yes,
it is safe to say that every time I entered the <i>Raging Queen</i>, I fell in
love with her all over again. </p>
<p>I
took a few steps and then paused a moment. Never wanted to go in too far at
once. Better to do it slowly, a lit bit at a time. Build up the anticipation,
tease her, almost. She moaned louder. Bucked harder. Screamed with more fury. I
had her right where I wanted her.</p>
<p>I
began to hear the mutterings of the men above me. That might distract a lesser
man, but to me it only made me want to go slower. I never shied away from being
caught with my <i>Raging Queen</i>.</p>
<p>Finally,
with deeper penetration on every step, I reached the poop cabin.</p>
<p>Most
men are proud of their poops. How large they are, how beautiful they are upon
close examination. Why, every Rear Admiral I meet within minutes would ask me
if I wanted to see his poop. Of course I would accept—you never decline a man’s
invitation to show you his poop—and whether it was a clean poop or a messy
poop, we’d spend the next several hours examining every inch of it, even
playing games in it from time to time. Poker was a popular one. I’ve lost count
of the number of times I’ve pokered in a man’s poop.</p>
<p>But
while every man is proud of his poop, I happened to think mine was especially
delightful. It was larger than most, and I boasted that over one hundred
different kinds of woods had been inside it—dark woods and light woods, hard
woods and soft woods, rough woods and smooth woods, tight woods and loose
woods. There were traces of each all throughout my poop, most of which had been
acquired during my various world travels: an Akan Fertility Doll, dark brown
with a large round head, given to me by a long, thin Indian; a trunk of African
ebony; dozens of light, softwood rodents which still tickle my fancy; and a
massive horse-hair rope that hung from the ceiling and seemed to impress all
with its girth. I’d grown to love the darker, harder, rougher woods the best,
so those were the ones I invited into my poop the most, but really I’d put
anything strong or unique in there if it would fit. </p>
<p>My
poop, of course, was where I took my meals, so all my food would end up there
eventually. I brought all different kinds of nuts, and meats, and the odd
vegetable when I was in the right mood. And all of these would combine to give
it a wonderful, oaky aroma, which filled my nostrils in a musky bouquet. </p>
<p>Yes,
I loved my poop, and I spent as much time in there as possible.</p>
<p>The
shelf just inside my poop contains books, so coming in this evening I selected
one at random and took it to my seat—a narrow object of porcelain, which the
Chinese say is a seat for the gods. I sat proudly and opened the tome, resting
it on my widened my knees, to carry its massive weight. Presently, there was a
knock at the door. </p>
<p>He
was early.</p><p></p><p></p></div>","A Gay Pirate Romance Novel!Some call him the Flaming Death. Others call him the Gut Stuffer. Still others, the Most Fearsome Fruit in All of France.

Raging Queen had two openings—one in the front, at the mouth of the
ship, and a smaller opening at the rear. The rear entrance had always been my
favorite. The passage was long and narrow, with a smooth finish. I am not the
largest of men, but even so it was always a tight fit, which made it quite the
experience. It was as if, as I entered her, she was squeezing me tight, willing
me never to let me go. 
I
ran my hands along her through the length of her corridor, fingering her
delicately in a loving embrace. My Raging Queen moved up and down
underneath me in undulating waves, almost shuddering under my touch. She
creaked and moaned, screamed and gyrated, and though she was for now under the
control of my seamen, it was I, only I, whose every order she followed. She
submitted to me first, always to me, and I liked it that way. 
Yes,
it is safe to say that every time I entered the Raging Queen, I fell in
love with her all over again. 
I
took a few steps and then paused a moment. Never wanted to go in too far at
once. Better to do it slowly, a lit bit at a time. Build up the anticipation,
tease her, almost. She moaned louder. Bucked harder. Screamed with more fury. I
had her right where I wanted her.
I
began to hear the mutterings of the men above me. That might distract a lesser
man, but to me it only made me want to go slower. I never shied away from being
caught with my Raging Queen.
Finally,
with deeper penetration on every step, I reached the poop cabin.
Most
men are proud of their poops. How large they are, how beautiful they are upon
close examination. Why, every Rear Admiral I meet within minutes would ask me
if I wanted to see his poop. Of course I would accept—you never decline a man’s
invitation to show you his poop—and whether it was a clean poop or a messy
poop, we’d spend the next several hours examining every inch of it, even
playing games in it from time to time. Poker was a popular one. I’ve lost count
of the number of times I’ve pokered in a man’s poop.
But
while every man is proud of his poop, I happened to think mine was especially
delightful. It was larger than most, and I boasted that over one hundred
different kinds of woods had been inside it—dark woods and light woods, hard
woods and soft woods, rough woods and smooth woods, tight woods and loose
woods. There were traces of each all throughout my poop, most of which had been
acquired during my various world travels: an Akan Fertility Doll, dark brown
with a large round head, given to me by a long, thin Indian; a trunk of African
ebony; dozens of light, softwood rodents which still tickle my fancy; and a
massive horse-hair rope that hung from the ceiling and seemed to impress all
with its girth. I’d grown to love the darker, harder, rougher woods the best,
so those were the ones I invited into my poop the most, but really I’d put
anything strong or unique in there if it would fit. 
My
poop, of course, was where I took my meals, so all my food would end up there
eventually. I brought all different kinds of nuts, and meats, and the odd
vegetable when I was in the right mood. And all of these would combine to give
it a wonderful, oaky aroma, which filled my nostrils in a musky bouquet. 
Yes,
I loved my poop, and I spent as much time in there as possible.
The
shelf just inside my poop contains books, so coming in this evening I selected
one at random and took it to my seat—a narrow object of porcelain, which the
Chinese say is a seat for the gods. I sat proudly and opened the tome, resting
it on my widened my knees, to carry its massive weight. Presently, there was a
knock at the door.

<h3>Short Summary<br/>
</h3>
<p>  So, as some of you may know, my name is Lucinda Grange, I'm a young photographer based in the North of England. Having been going on adventures and taking photos throughout for the past six years, I've decided I aught to put it down on paper, in my first book, to share with you! From walking the dirtiest sewers under London, to sporting clothes last seen in Paris Fashion Week on top of the Pyramids of Giza, the last six years has been incredible, and I'd like to share much of what I've seen and felt with you!</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>  I'm making a limited run on 50, numbered and signed large books, 28 pages, of glossy images and a few stories in there too, sadly with limited numbers with printing comes a greater cost, and so the unit price of the books is to be £50 (50x50 making the total I'm wanting to raise: £2500). But this will also include shipping! All donations will be appreciated, big or small, the name of any person donating will go in the book.<br/>  If you're feeling generous and are able to donate £100 or more, you will also receive a limited edition print! Also numbered and signed one of 25.<br/></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>The Impact<br/>
</h3>
<p>  This project will have a big impact on me, it will cause me to focus on my writing, getting things on paper before my next book, a written book of adventures, as well as sharing my work being where I find the most enjoyment. I'd like to think the images and stories will have a positive effect on any reader too!<br/></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> If you can't afford the book, or even a small donation, please feel free to help motivate me, look at my work here and post on my adventure blog if you have the time:<br/><br/><a href=""http://www.theeyeofsilence.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.theeyeofsilence.com</a><br/></span></div>","Short Summary

</div><p>Last August I participated in the Postcard Poetry Fest organized by Paul Nelson and Brendan McBreen. The idea of the festival is to challenge poets around the globe to handwrite and mail a postcard-sized poem a day throughout the month of August. Last year, I composed and mailed nearly 70 little 6-line centos to fellow writers. I composed my poems completely from found text in front of me each morning: My dissertation reading on digital and new media, my friends’ Facebook status updates, my horoscope, the novels at the top of my reading list, as well as songs I was listening to on Spotify. It was a blast. I loved how the physical constraints of handwriting affected the length and placement of the lines, which in turn pushed me toward open field composition strategies as well as visual and concrete forms. I’m now putting the finishing touches on a full-length book collection of these poems, which I hope to find a publisher for sometime this fall.</p><p>This past year, since the postcard fest ended, has been a tough one for me. I’ve had to deal with the stress of underemployment, the loss of stable housing, and the death of my mother. I want to tap into the emotional energy of those trials, so this year I plan to add another layer to the process by incorporating personal and somewhat sentimental writing to the mix of materials. To do this, I am spending July working on 2 separate notebooks that I’m calling my daybook and my nightbook. In the daybook, I am doing my best to meditate on the past, reflecting on specific, little memories. My nightbook, on the other hand, will focus on the future as each evening/night, I will consult the tarot, using the daily reading to meditate on the future. These notebooks will then become a part of the collage material for the postcards. As I did last year, I will again be using custom ordered postcards, this time in 6” squares instead of the 5” squares that caused postal issues last August. These square cards will incorporate my own visual art pieces (you can see samples of my work at <a href=""http://instragram.com/busylittle1way"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://instragram.com/busylittle1way</a>) that will serve as thematic prompts for the poems and their titles.</p><p>At this point, I’d like to invite each of you into the process as contributors, but also as recipients. Each person who donates will receive a handwritten postcard poem. Those who donate at least $20 will receive a postcard poem each week during the fest. Since $50 donations will help me to offset the cost of printing new postcards specifically for the fest, contributors at this level, will not only receive weekly postcard poems, but also a set of postcards for their own use. Donors at the $100 level will also receive a set of 8”x8” prints of the images used for the postcards. Because $150 donations will practically cover the entirety of the basic costs of postcards and postage, for donors at this level, I plan to hand-make a very limited edition chapbook of poems from this year’s fest, and donors of $200 or more will receive that plus my eternal gratitude along with free signed copies of any books I publish over the next decade.</p><p>Thanks to each of you who donated last year, and to those who will participate in this year’s project.</p><p></p></div>","Last August I participated in the Postcard Poetry Fest organized by Paul Nelson and Brendan McBreen.

</div></div>","HI, WE'RE SMOKING GLUE GUN.

We're an
independent small press and online magazine based in Austin, Tx. We publish innovative, experimental art &
writing four times a year online and as print chapbooks. In the last three years we’ve published over 150
writers and artists on smokinggluegun.com, as well as two chapbooks: Pattern Exhaustion (Nate Pritts) and Sunburn / Freezer Burn (Colleen Barry).

This year we bring you two more print titles: 
DANDELION FARM and THROWN: FULL-COLOR COLLECTIONS OF ART & POETRY
Both chapbooks are collaborative art books: Dandelion Farm is a playlet by Darcie Dennigan interspersed with drawings & collage by Carl Dimitri. thrown is a collection of poems by j/j hastain set to collages by Marthe Reed. Both will be printed in full-color, and we're excited as ever to show them off. 



Dandelion Farm, Darcie Dennigan & Carl Dimitri

""Dandelion Farm
unfolds at once in the darkened jewel-box theater of the skull and on an
expanse of lawn as full of green promise as the vowels in the name Mahalia. This series of cycling sketches
recalls at once a score, a play, a novelette, a collage, a net for remembering,
a spell for calling back. Like a dandelion or a player piano, it plays its
delicate song on the points of its golden teeth.""  
-Joyelle McSweeney



thrown, j/j hastain & Marthe Reed

""j/j hastain and
Marthe Reed depict a visual and auditory change in personal reality and
definition. Their stunning reflection upon gender shifts, through combined visual
and auditory art, offers a geometric and

WE NEED YOUR HELP TO MAKE THINGS HAPPEN.


Smoking Glue Gun is run by two young poets dedicated to putting new voices (and art!) into the world. We believe in putting exciting collections like these into print, and into people's hands. 
We're an independent organization, so we're independently funded. Most of the costs of running Smoking Glue Gun come out-of-pocket or are generated by chapbook
sales, but our largest expense by far is the cost of printing & distributing our chapbooks.
We need to raise $2,000 to publish Dandelion Farm and thrown. When you support this campaign, your dollars will go directly to pay for the costs of printing, publishing, and distribution. 
CHAPBOOKS FOR EVERYBODY!


Yep, every donor will receive a chapbook (or more) in exchange for their support. You can also snag a copy of last year's chapbooks, Pattern Exhaustion (Pritts) and Sunburn / Freezer Burn (Barry), or a broadside from Dandelion Farm orThrown. A few will be lucky enough to receive a phone call from j/j hastain with a personal poetry & song performance.

<li>Soy escritor. Soy católico. Soy moderno. Cuando escribí este libro, pensé que mi destino era llegar a ser una especie de G.K. Chesterton en lengua española. A la fecha, creo que, en lo que más he logrado parecerme a Chesterton, es en que puedo responder como él, cuando le hicieron la pregunta: ""¿Qué está mal en el mundo?"". Mi respuesta también podría ser: ""Yo.""

<i>Humo blanco</i> es el primer libro después de que ocurrió el gran cataclismo que cambió mi vida para siempre: mi conversión a la fe católica. La primera edición vendió como 4000 ejemplares. Lo escribí con libertad recién descubierta, aventurándome en el mundo de la fe y de la religión y de la antigua cultura de Occidente. Cuando lo escribí, soñaba con que fuera un libro que ayudara, a quienes lo leyeran, a sentir aquello que yo estaba sintiendo, a conocer a quien yo estaba empezando a conocer.</li>

Pero me atrevo a hacer este intento por algunos comentarios que he recibido, de un hombre que cuidaba una bodega, de otro que abordó el taxi que en algún momento de su vida manejó mi papá.

<br/>This is the campaign for my new erotic adventure novel Call of the Crimson Empire.  Doing something different this time and going for a pulp space opera mixed with swashbuckling - a kind of <i>The Clone in the Iron Mask<br/><br/></i>
<p><i>In
a distant future, across the starry reaches of space, the far-flung
Zor Empire lies in chaos.  The Empress is dead, murdered by rival
claimants to the throne, and o</i><i>pportunists,
traitors, and schemers vie for control of the succession. </i>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><i>All
Kasar Kell Calyx wanted was to escape her dull life on a backwater
moon, but when she travels to Zor Prime to join the Imperial Guard,
she discovers they are outlawed, hunted by the dead empress’s
enemies. She quickly finds herself arrested—her mouth once again
getting her into trouble—but imprisonment yields vital and
potentially deadly information: a true heir to the throne is hidden
on a far-off, desolate planet. </i>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><i>Suddenly
embroiled in murder and intrigue, Kasar must decide who to trust as
multiple factions seek what she knows. She joins forces with three
renegade Guardsmen intent on finding the true Empress and restoring
her to the throne: Shirda, a former assassin hiding her past behind
the Guard’s red cloak; Rel, a disgraced nobleman with Psionic
powers; and Tor, a giant from a distant planet who has vowed to serve
the crown. </i>

This is the campaign for my new erotic adventure novel Call of the Crimson Empire.  Doing something different this time and going for a pulp space opera mixed with swashbuckling - a kind of The Clone in the Iron Mask
In
a distant future, across the starry reaches of space, the far-flung
Zor Empire lies in chaos.  The Empress is dead, murdered by rival
claimants to the throne, and opportunists,
traitors, and schemers vie for control of the succession. 



All
Kasar Kell Calyx wanted was to escape her dull life on a backwater
moon, but when she travels to Zor Prime to join the Imperial Guard,
she discovers they are outlawed, hunted by the dead empress’s
enemies. She quickly finds herself arrested—her mouth once again
getting her into trouble—but imprisonment yields vital and
potentially deadly information: a true heir to the throne is hidden
on a far-off, desolate planet. 



Suddenly
embroiled in murder and intrigue, Kasar must decide who to trust as
multiple factions seek what she knows. She joins forces with three
renegade Guardsmen intent on finding the true Empress and restoring
her to the throne: Shirda, a former assassin hiding her past behind
the Guard’s red cloak; Rel, a disgraced nobleman with Psionic
powers; and Tor, a giant from a distant planet who has vowed to serve
the crown. 



Together,
they must race find the hidden heir before a pretender can seize the
throne and forever take control of the Crimson Empire! 



So

Call of the Crimson Empire

<h2>Be part of Lesotho's literary revolution</h2>
<p>Ba re e ne re was founded in 2011 when local visionary Liepollo Rantekoa hosted the first Ba re e ne re Literature Festival. Liepollo passed away tragically in 2012, though since then, we, her friends with the support of her family, have rallied together to strive for her vision of a more literate and creative Lesotho.</p>
<p>To expand the opportunities writers in Lesotho have to share their stories, this year we set out to design and publish a book of all new writing, which we plan to launch on the opening night of our literature festival in December. This essential book, which we’re calling “Likheleke tsa puo”, meaning “wordsmiths” in Sesotho, contains 23 original stories that have never been published before. They are written in both English and Lesotho’s original brand of Sesotho, because it’s incredibly important for us to promote indigenous language and allow writers to express themselves how they are most comfortable.</p>
<p>Though some of the earliest southern African literature came from Lesotho, such as Thomas Mofolo’s Chaka, there’s not a lot of publishing of non-academic fiction happening in Lesotho these days. And that’s exactly what makes this short story collection so special. Having hosted our literature festival in Lesotho for the last few years, we can tell you that Basotho writers are hungry for opportunities to get their stories out there and revive our nation’s literary tradition. We can’t wait to share their voices with you.</p>
<p>When people think of Lesotho, they might imagine mountains, horses, woven hats and sadly, HIV, but we’re determined to break the stereotypes of Lesotho by presenting new diverse narratives created by talented Basotho writers telling their own stories. These stories in particular, tackle the nuance of relationships, dreams, religion, sex, and culture in exciting new ways.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need your help in bringing this book to life. When this project is funded, not only will contributors to this campaign be able to earn a copy of the book, you will also have been an important part of igniting Lesotho’s literary revolution. At the different reward levels you can earn a signed copy of the book, get your name printed in the book, and be an official sponsor of Ba re e re's book launch event!</p>
<p>Our goal is to raise $900 to cover the book's design, editing, printing and registration. We're doing as much of the work as possible in house to keep costs low. Here's the breakdown of what we're asking for:</p>
<ul>
<li>$520 will go to the book printing</li>
<li>$100 will go to book editing</li>
<li>$100 will go to the book's design</li>
<li>$100 will go to the book's registration</li>
<li>$80 will cover transaction fees</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Impacting Lesotho's literary future</h3>
<p>All sales of the book will go into a BA RE E NE RE BOOK FUND to support the production of future books published by Ba re e ne re so that we can continue to provide a platform to Lesotho’s talented writers. So your contribution will continue to multiply!</p>
<p> The more books we produce, the more Basotho youth can be inspired by local voices, further developing the cultures of reading and writing in Lesotho, and restoring Lesotho’s incredible literary tradition.</p>

<h2>My Story</h2>
<p><strong>Hey there! I'm Gwendolyn Valerius and I'm an author and editor</strong>. I'm also a southern girl with a penchant for accents, Korean dramas, and steaming bowls of Ramen. With two novels already under my belt, I was well into the third when a different kind of third materialized: a baby!</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1573321152/m9lrsgyfbhtyauqijixl.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Suddenly, I went from an established routine that included hours to develop ideas and write (aka stare at a blank word document) to barely having time to open the computer. </p>
<p>Then one night, my then 3 year old asked me to tell her a story. After spinning a tale that left her giggling instead of snoozing, I realized I didn't have to stop creating! I just needed a shift in focus. One that would allow me to do what I loved, while also giving me space to see and be grateful for the good changes kiddos bring. Instead of writing long (but juicy) novels, I decided to try crafting short, fun stories about the wild and wacky adventures of my three kids! </p>
<h2>Why self-publish... </h2>
<p><strong>My first children's book, <i>Queen Baby</i>,</strong> is the story of how baby #3 rules our household, with a medieval twist! I chose to publish this through my company, Dash and Keys Publishing, because I wanted to retain creative control, and also get the book to you in a few months as opposed to the years it could take via traditional publishing. </p>

<p>Though self-publishing allows me to be in charge of all things related to my book, its an expensive undertaking as it means I'm in charge of all things related to my book (haha!). Between illustrating, formatting, and marketing, the costs add up quickly. My goal is to raise $5,000 which will give my finished manuscript the initial boost needed to ready it for the shelves of your favorite bookstores. </p>
<p><strong>If the goal is not reached,</strong> funds will be put towards the illustration/formatting costs for the book. </p>
<p><strong>If I exceed the fundraising goal, </strong>(insert praying hands emoji) the money will go towards an additional print run, vendor fees for book conferences, and mock-ups for my next children's book, Super Mimi and the T-Rex!</p>

I wrote this book because i have always had a fixation with great figures of the past and their relevancy in shaping our professional lives. With this book showing key interest primarily in the era of enlightenment and its relevancy to our society.<br/><br/>From Nelson to Alexzander I of Russia the leading individuals of this age did a lot to shape our societal landscape and influence every facet of our professional lives. These principles have been subsequently put into play over the years and the example of these individuals has gone on to inspire some of the greatest leaders over the last 250 years. And in a time where division and ineffective leadership has become the norm across the world the lessons from this era in history could be crucial in alleviating the problems we face in our current predicament. Providing a manual to emerging leaders in being able to act swiftly and decisively in times of both peace and war. Ensuring that all problems are remedied before they morph into conflict that instead of bringing progress in society pulls us back towards the problems of days passed.<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover the importance of principled and purposeful leadership in decisive outcomes abounding. In this book, I hope to instill in you the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for history as ultimately ""memory is what reason is based on to deny it is to deny reason itself.""<br/><br/>In this book, you'll learn about effective and efficient means of leadership. With 5 of the 9 principles of the Art of Decisive leadership explored in detail. Belief, health, meritocracy, attention to detail and unity of purpose will all be in the spotlight. With riveting stories from scientists, monarchs, captains of industry, sportsmen and women, those in governance, musicians, women leadership, and military officials to name but a few.<br/><br/>You will love this book if you are:</p><ul>
<li>An emerging leader looking to establish a purposeful and well guided principle based leadership model.</li>
<li>If you are a man or woman of action who is looking for a way to be able to maximize the potential of yourself and those around you</li>
<li>If you are an avid lover of literature with an affinity towards highly descriptive and vivid story telling.</li>
</ul><p><i>The Art of Decisive Leadership</i> is a nonfiction book that speaks to professional audience and avid reader alike who want to look at history and its influence on leadership in a enlightened way.</p><h3>The Book - The Art of Decisive Leadership</h3><p>The book is written in 7 parts.<br/><br/>Part 1 - The introduction highlights the pillars of principle and traits in character pivotal to a man or woman of a decisive nature. Whilst also profiling the era to which many of our dazzling and astonishing tales will stem from. That of the Enlightenment.<br/><br/>Part 2 - Focuses on the first pillar of decisive leadership that of belief. Impossible is a word belonging only in the dictionary of fools. And through the lively and graphic tales of some of our many men and women of a decisive nature. We show the importance of a can-do spirit in erasing the cloud of doubt that brings hesitance into our action. Fostering the faith in our God-endowed abilities to act without second thought. Whilst also channeling our inner strength to allow us to soldier through in trying times.<br/><br/>Part 3 - Focuses on the pillar of decisive leadership which focuses on health. Its importance in any action never mind decisive action is clear for all in sundry as we stand in the midst of a global pandemic. And throughout history the importance of health in decisive action cannot be understated. From the last great age of sailing in the 1800s to the present day. A healthy mind, body, and soul is crucial in decisively settling any dispute in one's favor. Allowing us to think and execute clearly and conclusively. With perfect synergy between mind and body.<br/><br/>Part 4 - Focuses on the pillar of meritocracy and the importance of reward in allowing decisive outcomes to abound. Reward is motivation as it gives incentive to the beings one leads which triggers their will power to want to give more to the cause. Merit is the fuel which drives the vehicle of our ambitions down the path of destiny’s avenue. As it gives impulse to the spirt of man to want to innovate and create solutions that decisively solve trials we face on a day to day.<br/>.<br/>Part 5 - Profiles the pillar of attention to detail. Always prepare or be prepared to be washed asunder by the enemy. Detail is important in ensuring that you have all the necessary tools in executing your mission as an organisation. And undergoing strenuous drill and practice is pivotal in mastering any craft. Ensuring that one's actions are seamless in their execution and branded onto their very essence.<br/><br/>Part 6 - Focuses on the pillar of principle that is unity of purpose detailing the importance of cohesiveness and coordination in fostering decisive outcomes. This would not mean that there is a need to always agree. But compromise’s importance in realizing decisive action towards our shared goals is crucial. Aiding us in avoiding the purposeless gridlock that slows down our progress in society. Bringing conflict and calamity abounding.<br/><br/>Part 7 - Will provide conclusion to the first part of the art of decisive leadership. Detailing the second part and the riveting tales to be told through the lenses of the last four pillars of decisive leadership. Those of a keen first impression, perception, legacy and initiative.</p><p> </p><h3>What I Need &amp; What You'll Get</h3><p>This book will be published with New Degree Press.

I wrote this book because i have always had a fixation with great figures of the past and their relevancy in shaping our professional lives. With this book showing key interest primarily in the era of enlightenment and its relevancy to our society.From Nelson to Alexzander I of Russia the leading individuals of this age did a lot to shape our societal landscape and influence every facet of our professional lives. These principles have been subsequently put into play over the years and the example of these individuals has gone on to inspire some of the greatest leaders over the last 250 years. And in a time where division and ineffective leadership has become the norm across the world the lessons from this era in history could be crucial in alleviating the problems we face in our current predicament. Providing a manual to emerging leaders in being able to act swiftly and decisively in times of both peace and war. Ensuring that all problems are remedied before they morph into conflict that instead of bringing progress in society pulls us back towards the problems of days passed.My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover the importance of principled and purposeful leadership in decisive outcomes abounding. In this book, I hope to instill in you the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for history as ultimately ""memory is what reason is based on to deny it is to deny reason itself.""In this book, you'll learn about effective and efficient means of leadership. With 5 of the 9 principles of the Art of Decisive leadership explored in detail. Belief, health, meritocracy, attention to detail and unity of purpose will all be in the spotlight. With riveting stories from scientists, monarchs, captains of industry, sportsmen and women, those in governance, musicians, women leadership, and military officials to name but a few.You will love this book if you are:
An emerging leader looking to establish a purposeful and well guided principle based leadership model.
If you are a man or woman of action who is looking for a way to be able to maximize the potential of yourself and those around you
If you are an avid lover of literature with an affinity towards highly descriptive and vivid story telling.

I also share my newfound belief that wisdom and growth can emerge from struggle, sadness, and the loss of a partner. Ultimately, I want you to see this book as a tool to help you flourish.<br/><br/>Within the stories, you will hear other widows’ views about the hard parts of life after loss, and what they do to make themselves feel more centered and complete. You'll hear widows talk about topics such as:</p><ul>
<li>What to do with a loved one’s belongings after they pass</li>
<li>How to make holidays tolerable (and maybe even joyful)</li>
<li>Ideas for helping children survive the loss of a parent</li>
</ul><p>You will love this book if you are looking to relate to other widows, are interested in forward thinking about loss and growth, or are hoping to find strategies to help you heal.</p><p> </p><h2>The Book</h2><p>My book is divided into 4 parts:</p><p>Part 1 is called Charting the Course.  It is about the history of widowhood and the current situation of widows in countries around the world. It also delves into grief theory and how grief, at times, can be restorative.<br/><br/>Part 2, Turbulence, has to do with many of the issues that make being a young widow so difficult- ranging from dealing with the fears and anxiety associated with widowhood to managing life as a me vs. a we.<br/><br/>Part 3 deals with The Crew.  It focuses completely on young widows with children. It counts the many ways that solo parenting is exhausting and heartbreaking, while offering advice from multiple widows on helping your children heal and be resilient.<br/><br/>Part 4, entitled Surviving the Storm, is packed with strategies that have helped me and fellow young widows survive and grow stronger, such as connecting with other widows, creating rituals to help ease the pain of loss, and insight on dating after loss.</p><p> </p><h2>What I Need &amp; What You'll Get</h2><p>This book will be published with New Degree Press. I set up the pre-order tiers to help cover the costs for publishing my book. Money raised will go towards the following:</p><ul>

<h3>The Book I Never Knew I Wanted To Write</h3>
<p>I have been making and using sigils (magickal symbols) for over a decade. A couple of years ago I really wanted to do something creative, but I had no idea what to do. So I made a sigil to manifest creativity and prosperity. That inspired me to set up an on-line sigil making tutorial. One of the sections of the tutorial was about how to go beyond the original purpose of the sigil and use it to inspire a creative adventure. I created a visual sample and I so enjoyed that process that I kept making more artwork inspired by sigils.<br/><br/>As I made more pieces the idea for the book began to take shape. It occurred to me that I could help people understand that Creative does not always mean Artistic and show them how to use sigils to inspire their dormant creativity!</p>

<h3>Your Support Matters!</h3>
<p>This self publishing odyssey is quite a learning experience! Two of the things I've discovered are that I can't do it on my own and it isn't free. I don't have some of the skills needed to get the book published and promoted. I can learn these skills, and have plans to do so, but they're not things I can learn overnight and I'd like to publish the book this year.</p>
<p>Although I can design the print version of the book I don't have the skill (yet) to format it for e-readers so I will have to hire someone to do that. I will need to get an ISBN number, publishing accounts and ads to publicize the book among other things. Full disclosure: Even if I don't get fully funded I still plan to publish the book and send out perks, it will just take a lot longer!</p>

<p><i>Una entrevista para narrar todo sobre ""raydg"" </i></p>
<p><i>- Cuéntanos un poco de ti Aarón... Danos un breve resumen de tu historia.</i></p>
<p>- AS: Hola, un placer me llamo Aaron Salazar, antes que hablarte sobre mí, debo agradecerte por tomarte el tiempo de saber sobre este proyecto. Soy un joven arquitecto, enteramente caraqueño, graduado en la Universidad Central de Venezuela (UCV) hace poco más de dos años, de la cual fui colaborador y luego profesor en la Facultad de Arquitectura y Urbanismo (FAU) en las áreas de expresión arquitectónica, viendo la representación técnica como un proceso artístico, y habilidad del pensamiento creativo, donde la imaginación misma es comprendida y aplicada. Puedo decirte de mi que siempre he tenido tres pasiones: dibujar, aprender y enseñar, por eso durante mi período como docente fui un profesional satisfecho, feliz por la dicha y el placer de dar clases a las jóvenes generaciones, siendo parte de la misma y, por supuesto, aprender en el proceso. A la vez trabajaba en una oficina de arquitectura a distancia, vivía lejos de la capital por lo que debía trasladarme en tren y sistema metro por dos horas, las cuales aprovechaba para dibujar y organizar mis clases. Esta era mi vida hasta que el ambiente inestable de mi amado país, me empujó  a alejarme de ese sueño materializado, dejándome un vacío en la existencia misma. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1524624864/xtpx4b5iua48kn9nsvjp.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p><i>La realidad que le toca a muchos. ¿Y que sucedió estando afuera?</i></p>
<p>AS: Bueno hoy, lejos de mis seres queridos, y llamo a así a mis profesores, estudiantes, y claro está, familia y amigos, tengo una oportunidad de retomar mis pasiones. Tuve la fortuna de ser admitido en la <strong>Universidad Complutense de Madrid</strong>, para realizar una <strong>Maestría en Diseño</strong> (grito de enhorabuena!) y después de procesar la emoción que me produjo esa noticia, decidí que dedicaré el trabajo final de ese postgrado a los que me formaron, a los que pude enseñar, y a todos los que están en proceso de aprendizaje. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1524625583/clv7fimxd1agckb8dt2g.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p><i>Y ¿Por qué un crowdfunding? ¿Por qué llegaste a la conclusión de usar este medio para lograrlo?</i></p>
<p>AS: Honestamente había escuchado sobre los <i>crowdunding</i> para lograr metas de ayuda médica, incluso venezolanos que lo usan para salir del país, pero cuando recibí la aceptación de la Complutense, tuve que detenerme y pensar ¿Cómo pago la matrícula?. El calendario no me daba para reunir lo suficiente con mi trabajo, pero si tenía algo claro al postularme: quería hacer un libro sobre <strong>Expresión gráfica</strong>.</p>
<p>Siempre he creído en la fuerza del <strong>trabajo en equipo</strong>, lo que puede ser alcanzado con la suma de manos y mentes. Soy una persona plenamente orgullosa de lo que mis estudiantes y yo logramos en la universidad, cuando al exponer los dibujos realizados en clase exaltamos el resultado de horas de trabajo en maravillosas presentaciones.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1524628220/o02swacfyogemt8uu3dp.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Con esta maestría en puerta, y la oportunidad de transformarla en un bien colectivo, no quiero que el dinero sea un impedimento, confío en que el más mínimo aporte, ya sea monetario o compartiendo este proyecto, impulsará cada página que, al final, le pertenecerá a esos colaboradores y tendrán la potestad de decir: ""yo ayude en la producción de este libro"". </p>
<p><i>Puede que suene un poco obvio, pero ¿Cuál es el objetivo concreto de este crowdfunding?</i></p>
<p>AS: Este <i>crowdfunding</i> tiene un único objetivo: superar las barreras económicas para generar un libro que brinde la oportunidad a otros de aprender, reflexionar y crear. <strong>RA&amp;DG</strong> (siglas de <strong>Representación Arquitectónica &amp; Diseño Gráfico</strong>) es el nombre que quise darle a este proyecto que, bajo mi perspectiva, comprende a la expresión gráfica de proyectos de arquitectura como un puente para dotar de sensibilidad ese dibujo técnico y transformarlo en un material artístico que se nutre de los conocimientos de la comunicación visual. </p>
<p><i><strong>RA&amp;DG</strong>, se escribe de con ""i"" inglesa y con g al final pero se pronuncia ""rayd"", cuéntanos un poco de ese material con nombre de persona.</i></p>
<p>AS: Si, correcto, se pronuncia así. <strong>RA&amp;DG</strong> será un ebook (libro digital) que contendrá técnicas y herramientas para el manejo de software con las cuales presentar coherentemente y con un espíritu artístico esos dibujos técnicos, gráficos e imágenes de proyectos de arquitectura y diseño de interiores. Basándose en los componentes gráficos necesarios para que un proyecto sea entendido, <strong>RA&amp;DG</strong> estará dividido en cinco temas: Planos e Isometría, Diagramas y Esquemas, Iconos e Isotipos, Perspectiva y Collage, y por último Retícula y Maquetación, los cuales explicarán, ejemplificando con edificaciones contemporáneas construidas y no construidas, como funciona la expresión gráfica en las diferentes escalas en la arquitectura.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>Arquitectos y diseñadores, como profesionales multidisciplinarios, se enfrentan diariamente a la <strong>inversión de horas</strong> en diversas actividades, que se despliegan desde la investigación, el proceso creativo y desarrollo de una idea hasta la producción de dibujos técnicos y modelos tridimensionales de sus proyectos. Con frecuencia se encuentran obstáculos donde los minutos parecen jugar en contra, ya sea por falta de conocimientos, estrategias o técnicas que agilicen el procedimiento, y esto se refleja, en la mayoría de los casos, en el uso de las herramientas digitales donde se realiza el producto final.</p>
<p><i>Suena diferente. ¿Qué importancia consideras que tiene este proyecto?</i></p>
<p>AS: Su importancia gira en torno a <strong>sensibilizar</strong> la representación arquitectónica y <strong>optimizar</strong> un recurso, cuya escasez se transforma en un problema para estudiantes y profesionales: el <strong>tiempo</strong>. Por esta razón, <strong>RA&amp;DG</strong> a modo de guía contendrá una recopilación no solo de teorías sobre la presentación de proyectos, sino de técnicas y estrategias para un mejor uso de las horas de trabajo y obtener resultados de alta calidad. Cada tema tendrá una sección de consejos sobre el manejo de software como <strong>Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Illustrator y Adobe Indesign</strong>, y cual es la mejor manera de utilizar cada uno.</p>
<p>Sería un éxito total invertir semanas de trabajo para que centenares de profesionales y estudiantes saquen provecho de cada <strong>valioso minuto</strong>, mejoren sus destrezas en el uso de herramientas digitales, incrementen su sensibilidad plástica y otorguen un espíritu artístico a sus diseños. </p>
<p><i>Quiere decir que está dirigido para dibujantes y profesionales afines ¿no?</i></p>
<p>AS: <strong>RA&amp;DG</strong> está dirigido a <strong>estudiantes</strong> de arquitectura, diseño gráfico, diseño de interiores y también a <strong>arquitectos</strong> y <strong>diseñadores</strong> que, como colectivos, estudios u oficinas, requieran de técnicas y material de referencia para participar en concursos de arquitectura o presentación de sus propios proyectos.</p>
<p><i>Hablemos de números ¿Cuánto necesitas y para qué?</i> </p>
<p>AS: El monto se divide para ser usado en tres fines puntuales, el <strong>pasaje aéreo </strong>idea y vuelta<strong> </strong>de Quito (ciudad donde resido hoy día) a Madrid, cuyo monto asciende a 1250 $ por la fecha de salida, la cual es septiembre de este año. Un <strong>seguro de viaje</strong> que solicita la embajada de España para conceder la visa de estudio, por 750$, y el costo de la <strong>maestría</strong> 6500$ (5050 euros). A esto se le suma un 5% de interés por parte de Indiegogo, resultando en 8500$ + 5% = 8925$. El resto de los gastos de estadía durante el año académico correrán por mi cuenta y la producción de este libro será el trabajo final que estaré desarrollando desde mi llegada para presentarlo en una primera instancia digital. Quizás, posteriormente, intente apostar por una editorial que tenga interés en su producción física, pero por el momento no está planteado. </p>
<p><i>Llegas en septiembre a tierras Europeas ¿Cuándo culminarías ese trabajo final de maestría que será RA&amp;DG?</i> </p>
<p>AS: La presentación final de RA&amp;DG será en mayo del 2019, pero todos los que contribuyan con el proyecto estarán recibiendo cada mes, a partir de septiembre, los avances del mismo, es decir crearemos una <strong>bitácora web</strong>. Con este libro nacerá una comunidad y un contacto online constante donde quiero que se sientan parte de su inicio, desarrollo y su final, porque cada semilla colocada irá creciendo, y todos serán testigos de ello.  </p>
<p><i>Si te apoyo ¿Qué ofreces a cambio de mi aporte?</i></p>
<p>AS: Pues, hay distintos niveles de productos que puedes obtener dependiendo de tu aporte.

</div></div>","Una entrevista para narrar todo sobre ""raydg"" 
- Cuéntanos un poco de ti Aarón... Danos un breve resumen de tu historia.
- AS: Hola, un placer me llamo Aaron Salazar, antes que hablarte sobre mí, debo agradecerte por tomarte el tiempo de saber sobre este proyecto. Soy un joven arquitecto, enteramente caraqueño, graduado en la Universidad Central de Venezuela (UCV) hace poco más de dos años, de la cual fui colaborador y luego profesor en la Facultad de Arquitectura y Urbanismo (FAU) en las áreas de expresión arquitectónica, viendo la representación técnica como un proceso artístico, y habilidad del pensamiento creativo, donde la imaginación misma es comprendida y aplicada. Puedo decirte de mi que siempre he tenido tres pasiones: dibujar, aprender y enseñar, por eso durante mi período como docente fui un profesional satisfecho, feliz por la dicha y el placer de dar clases a las jóvenes generaciones, siendo parte de la misma y, por supuesto, aprender en el proceso. A la vez trabajaba en una oficina de arquitectura a distancia, vivía lejos de la capital por lo que debía trasladarme en tren y sistema metro por dos horas, las cuales aprovechaba para dibujar y organizar mis clases. Esta era mi vida hasta que el ambiente inestable de mi amado país, me empujó  a alejarme de ese sueño materializado, dejándome un vacío en la existencia misma. 

 
La realidad que le toca a muchos. ¿Y que sucedió estando afuera?
AS: Bueno hoy, lejos de mis seres queridos, y llamo a así a mis profesores, estudiantes, y claro está, familia y amigos, tengo una oportunidad de retomar mis pasiones. Tuve la fortuna de ser admitido en la Universidad Complutense de Madrid, para realizar una Maestría en Diseño (grito de enhorabuena!) y después de procesar la emoción que me produjo esa noticia, decidí que dedicaré el trabajo final de ese postgrado a los que me formaron, a los que pude enseñar, y a todos los que están en proceso de aprendizaje. 

 
Y ¿Por qué un crowdfunding? ¿Por qué llegaste a la conclusión de usar este medio para lograrlo?
AS: Honestamente había escuchado sobre los crowdunding para lograr metas de ayuda médica, incluso venezolanos que lo usan para salir del país, pero cuando recibí la aceptación de la Complutense, tuve que detenerme y pensar ¿Cómo pago la matrícula?. El calendario no me daba para reunir lo suficiente con mi trabajo, pero si tenía algo claro al postularme: quería hacer un libro sobre Expresión gráfica.
Siempre he creído en la fuerza del trabajo en equipo, lo que puede ser alcanzado con la suma de manos y mentes. Soy una persona plenamente orgullosa de lo que mis estudiantes y yo logramos en la universidad, cuando al exponer los dibujos realizados en clase exaltamos el resultado de horas de trabajo en maravillosas presentaciones.

Con esta maestría en puerta, y la oportunidad de transformarla en un bien colectivo, no quiero que el dinero sea un impedimento, confío en que el más mínimo aporte, ya sea monetario o compartiendo este proyecto, impulsará cada página que, al final, le pertenecerá a esos colaboradores y tendrán la potestad de decir: ""yo ayude en la producción de este libro"". 
Puede que suene un poco obvio, pero ¿Cuál es el objetivo concreto de este crowdfunding?
AS: Este crowdfunding tiene un único objetivo: superar las barreras económicas para generar un libro que brinde la oportunidad a otros de aprender, reflexionar y crear. RA&DG (siglas de Representación Arquitectónica & Diseño Gráfico) es el nombre que quise darle a este proyecto que, bajo mi perspectiva, comprende a la expresión gráfica de proyectos de arquitectura como un puente para dotar de sensibilidad ese dibujo técnico y transformarlo en un material artístico que se nutre de los conocimientos de la comunicación visual. 
RA&DG, se escribe de con ""i"" inglesa y con g al final pero se pronuncia ""rayd"", cuéntanos un poco de ese material con nombre de persona.
AS: Si, correcto, se pronuncia así. RA&DG será un ebook (libro digital) que contendrá técnicas y herramientas para el manejo de software con las cuales presentar coherentemente y con un espíritu artístico esos dibujos técnicos, gráficos e imágenes de proyectos de arquitectura y diseño de interiores. Basándose en los componentes gráficos necesarios para que un proyecto sea entendido, RA&DG estará dividido en cinco temas: Planos e Isometría, Diagramas y Esquemas, Iconos e Isotipos, Perspectiva y Collage, y por último Retícula y Maquetación, los cuales explicarán, ejemplificando con edificaciones contemporáneas construidas y no construidas, como funciona la expresión gráfica en las diferentes escalas en la arquitectura.






 
Arquitectos y diseñadores, como profesionales multidisciplinarios, se enfrentan diariamente a la inversión de horas en diversas actividades, que se despliegan desde la investigación, el proceso creativo y desarrollo de una idea hasta la producción de dibujos técnicos y modelos tridimensionales de sus proyectos. Con frecuencia se encuentran obstáculos donde los minutos parecen jugar en contra, ya sea por falta de conocimientos, estrategias o técnicas que agilicen el procedimiento, y esto se refleja, en la mayoría de los casos, en el uso de las herramientas digitales donde se realiza el producto final.
Suena diferente. ¿Qué importancia consideras que tiene este proyecto?
AS: Su importancia gira en torno a sensibilizar la representación arquitectónica y optimizar un recurso, cuya escasez se transforma en un problema para estudiantes y profesionales: el tiempo. Por esta razón, RA&DG a modo de guía contendrá una recopilación no solo de teorías sobre la presentación de proyectos, sino de técnicas y estrategias para un mejor uso de las horas de trabajo y obtener resultados de alta calidad. Cada tema tendrá una sección de consejos sobre el manejo de software como Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Illustrator y Adobe Indesign, y cual es la mejor manera de utilizar cada uno.
Sería un éxito total invertir semanas de trabajo para que centenares de profesionales y estudiantes saquen provecho de cada valioso minuto, mejoren sus destrezas en el uso de herramientas digitales, incrementen su sensibilidad plástica y otorguen un espíritu artístico a sus diseños. 
Quiere decir que está dirigido para dibujantes y profesionales afines ¿no?
AS: RA&DG está dirigido a estudiantes de arquitectura, diseño gráfico, diseño de interiores y también a arquitectos y diseñadores que, como colectivos, estudios u oficinas, requieran de técnicas y material de referencia para participar en concursos de arquitectura o presentación de sus propios proyectos.
Hablemos de números ¿Cuánto necesitas y para qué? 
AS: El monto se divide para ser usado en tres fines puntuales, el pasaje aéreo idea y vuelta de Quito (ciudad donde resido hoy día) a Madrid, cuyo monto asciende a 1250 $ por la fecha de salida, la cual es septiembre de este año. Un seguro de viaje que solicita la embajada de España para conceder la visa de estudio, por 750$, y el costo de la maestría 6500$ (5050 euros). A esto se le suma un 5% de interés por parte de Indiegogo, resultando en 8500$ + 5% = 8925$. El resto de los gastos de estadía durante el año académico correrán por mi cuenta y la producción de este libro será el trabajo final que estaré desarrollando desde mi llegada para presentarlo en una primera instancia digital. Quizás, posteriormente, intente apostar por una editorial que tenga interés en su producción física, pero por el momento no está planteado. 
Llegas en septiembre a tierras Europeas ¿Cuándo culminarías ese trabajo final de maestría que será RA&DG? 
AS: La presentación final de RA&DG será en mayo del 2019, pero todos los que contribuyan con el proyecto estarán recibiendo cada mes, a partir de septiembre, los avances del mismo, es decir crearemos una bitácora web. Con este libro nacerá una comunidad y un contacto online constante donde quiero que se sientan parte de su inicio, desarrollo y su final, porque cada semilla colocada irá creciendo, y todos serán testigos de ello.  
Si te apoyo ¿Qué ofreces a cambio de mi aporte?
AS: Pues, hay distintos niveles de productos que puedes obtener dependiendo de tu aporte. Por ejemplo en el escalafón más bajo, puedes obtener una carpeta con más de 100 archivos de diferentes proyectos y representaciones gráficas que serían muy útiles para inspirarte al momento de escoger el estilo con el cual expresar tu diseño.
Pensando en un monto accesible para estudiantes, el libro en pdf puede obtenerse desde los 10$, donde evidentemente incluirá tu nombre en la sección de agradecimientos. Con 25$ el libro viene con una carpeta de iconos en vectores y las imágenes en formato PNG usadas en los Collages de RA&DG, árboles en alta resolución, personas, autos, cielos, texturas, paletas de colores, todas listas para que sean aplicadas directamente sobre tus propios proyectos. En las aportaciones de 50$ habrá, además de todo lo anterior, un manual más especializado para niveles avanzados de edición y producción en Photoshop e Illustrator respectivamente, perfectos para proyectos complejos o de escala urbana.
En los peldaños superiores, tenemos las aportaciones de 100$ y 250$. La primera te coloca como patrocinador oficial del libro, con la oportunidad de darle promoción a tu estudio, oficina o tu propio nombre en la portada, que visualizarán cientos de personas. En la última recompensa (esta es mi favorita) adicional al patrocinio, podrás enviar algún proyecto de tu autoría, ya sea académico, experimental, construido o en proceso, solo los planos en AutoCAD y su modelo tridimensional el cual, entendiendo su uso y proceso de idea, será trabajado dentro de los cinco temas de RA&DG, y estará incluido como uno de los referentes a ser consultados.

Me han dicho que eres bueno dibujando, si quisiera algo diferente a ese material ¿Tengo alguna opción?
AS: Existe un segundo grupo de recompensas especiales que pueden ser de gran interés para quienes deseen obsequiar un detalle o regalarse a sí mismos. El primero de ellos es un calendario personalizado del 2019, donde cada mes expone fotografías de atardeceres, albas, ciudades, naturaleza, momentos que he tenido la oportunidad de capturar en alta resolución.

<p>""The Shnoos and Panoos"" was written while I was feeling - you guessed it - lost and confused. I found myself focusing on what was wrong with the world instead of what was working. In an effort to reconnect with the things that made me happy, I limited the amount of time spent on the internet and began spending more time daydreaming, exploring nature, and creating art. Many wonderful creative projects emerged from this brief period of time - this book, for one thing - but most importantly, my inner sense of joy and peace returned and I was able to easily access happiness and positivity again!</p>
<p>Once the basic concept of my book was down in written form, I had so much fun illustrating it. Several watercolor and pencil illustrations were generated in the beginning. Eventually, I settled on a color palette and aesthetic I believed supported the world of the story, and created the final illustrations in Photoshop. There is nothing like getting lost in a world of your own making, especially when it's a world of silly creatures and made-up places. </p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Accessing</span><span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'> joy is natural for children, and I believe it is just as natural for adults. However, by the time we're grown, we've developed habits of abandoning our own inner joy in order to please others. I believe that we can take better care of our children by empowering them to own their uniqueness and pursue the things that truly bring them joy. My hope is that ""The Shnoos and Panoos"" will serve as a silly, but important, reminder for kids and adults to listen to our hearts when times are tough. </span></p>
<p>I've learned a ton through the making of this book. It's truly been a rewarding experience for me creatively and I can't wait to share it with others!</p>

The story behind the story ...

""The Shnoos and Panoos"" was written while I was feeling - you guessed it - lost and confused. I found myself focusing on what was wrong with the world instead of what was working. In an effort to reconnect with the things that made me happy, I limited the amount of time spent on the internet and began spending more time daydreaming, exploring nature, and creating art. Many wonderful creative projects emerged from this brief period of time - this book, for one thing - but most importantly, my inner sense of joy and peace returned and I was able to easily access happiness and positivity again!
Once the basic concept of my book was down in written form, I had so much fun illustrating it. Several watercolor and pencil illustrations were generated in the beginning. Eventually, I settled on a color palette and aesthetic I believed supported the world of the story, and created the final illustrations in Photoshop. There is nothing like getting lost in a world of your own making, especially when it's a world of silly creatures and made-up places. 
Accessing joy is natural for children, and I believe it is just as natural for adults. However, by the time we're grown, we've developed habits of abandoning our own inner joy in order to please others. I believe that we can take better care of our children by empowering them to own their uniqueness and pursue the things that truly bring them joy. My hope is that ""The Shnoos and Panoos"" will serve as a silly, but important, reminder for kids and adults to listen to our hearts when times are tough. 
I've learned a ton through the making of this book. It's truly been a rewarding experience for me creatively and I can't wait to share it with others!


$600 will get my book into people's hands and make it available for online purchase by September. 
Meeting my funding goal will jumpstart the self-publication process and allow contributors of $25 or more to get their hands on a signed copy of the book before it's made available to the general public. Funds raised beyond $600 will go straight towards printing fees for additional hard copies of the book.

<h3>About the Book</h3>
<p><i>A Gunslinger's Reckoning</i> is about an outlaw who is broken out of prison along with two hundred of his fellow inmates to join the army of a sinister and evil man they call warlock.  But the gunslinging outlaw is betrayed by warlock and inflicts his own brand of hell upon him.<br/><br/>My name is Juvencio (JS) Castro and I am the author of <i>A Gunslinger's Reckoning</i>. I wrote this book because I have always wanted to write a horror, a western, and a thriller wrapped up in one book.<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover a page-turner filled with excitement and adventure. I want you to see this book as an opportunity to escape from mundane reality.  Ride into the wild west alongside Tuck the outlaw as he combats the forces of a man they call Warlock.</p>
<p><i>A Gunslinger's Reckoning</i> takes place in 1875, inside America's Wild West.  We follow the story of Clyde Tuck, an outlaw gunslinger who is broken out of a remote barren prison that resides in the middle of a lifeless and barren desert.  His breakout, along with two hundred of his fellow inmates, is orchestrated by a man they call Warlock, but who is anything but.  Warlock, aka Von Onslaught, is a character possessed by evil who is motivated by wanting to become the next Napoleon Bonaparte.  He plans to turn hardened inmates into super soldiers that he can command. </p>
<p>This book will take you to places that you don't expect to go to in a Western.  You'll be thrust into World War II and the battle of Kasserine Pass, and travel back in time to 1066 and the Battle of Hasting's.  You'll find yourself in the Sierra Madre on top of a hidden valley where the residents that live there are trapped by spells and forces cast on them by the evil that resides there.</p>
<p><font><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">You will love this book if you are the type of person who likes living on the edge of your seat.  If you are someone who enjoys scary fun, or who just </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">loves to read a good adventure novel.</span></font></p>
<i>A Gunslinger's Reckoning</i> speaks to thrill-seeking adrenaline junkies and those who go to movies just to be in a tense and suspenseful situation.  There are those who want to grapple with a good western and darkness in a new way.<br/><br/>Ultimately, I hope that <i>A Gunslinger's Reckoning</i>  entertains the reader to the point of not being able to put it down. <p> </p>
<p>I am Juvencio (JS) Castro, an ex-Military vet and a Third Degree Black Belt in the Martial Arts.  I have had a wonderful life with a wonderful family.
