</div>Love's Door, an album of devotional chants, has been my ongoing labor of love.  I began work on the project in 2007, recording several tracks in John McDowell's studio in upstate New York, including a duet with my friend Krishna Das. Nearly 10 years later I'm committed to bringing this recording to life, with eleven original kirtan tracks and guest musician support including: a second duet with Krishna Das, instrumental contributions by Steve Gorn, Arjun Bruggeman, John McDowell, Terrence Pompey, Jesse Kotansky, and Nina Rao, guest vocals by Devadas Labrecque, Nina Rao and Janaki Kagel and a response choir full of many, many wonderful kirtan friends...but I can't make that final walk through the Door without your support!<div>

<p></p>The practice of chant and kirtan brings gifts that are way beyond anything that can be raised on Indiegogo, but still, creating a kirtan album that I feel good about offering to you all costs lots of money...more than I have in the bank!  I want very much to bring Love's Door into the world and I simply can't do that without your help to cover the expenses of recording, mixing, mastering, musicians, and of course packaging/presentation and production of the physical CD and the download; your generous support will go to fund all of these.

I've also been featured in response vocals on a number of other chant recordings.

I was told that there would be 40+ songwriters participating from all over the United States.

A poco a poco il piccolo gruppo si è avvalso della collaborazione sempre crescente di altri musicisti con gli stessi desideri, gli stessi obiettivi, gli stessi sogni e, ad oggi, l’orchestra consta di oltre 70 professori d’orchestra.

Step by step, the small group has taken advantage of the increasing collaboration of other musicians tied by same goals and dreams. So, to date, the orchestra is arrenged by over 70 members. We were confident of our strenght and passion, achiving our first concert season with our own economic effort, gaining the possibility to call such important and international artists as Maestro Francesco Ivan Ciampa, Maestro Valerio Galli, Maestro Sir Antonio Pappano, soprano Jessica Pratt, the dancer Josè Perez and many others.

Con le nostre sole forze economiche e con una grande passione che ci spinge a credere nella possibilità di rendere stabile la nostra orchestra abbiamo realizzato la nostra prima stagione concertistica che ha registrato sempre il tutto esaurito e ha visto alternarsi sul palco della nostra città, a titolo gratuito, artisti di fama internazionale come il M° Francesco Ivan Ciampa, il M° Valerio Galli, il M° Sir Antonio Pappano, il soprano Jessica Pratt, il ballerino Josè Perez e molti altri. “E’ un’orchestra piena di talento, piena di voglia e di grinta. Sono questi i progetti che bisogna portare avanti per far crescere la cultura musicale” Sir Antonio Pappanohttps://www.youtube.com/watch?t=102&v=B-pXgBjH2lI “La linfa vitale di questa orchestra è l’amore per la musica. Ogni sforzo, ogni difficoltà diventa energia sonora. Sono fiero ed orgoglioso di guidare questi giovani artisti” M° Francesco Ivan Ciampa  “Questi ragazzi sono fantastici, tornerò ogni volta che potrò perché è veramente una gioia poter lavorare con loro. Mi sta rimettendo al mondo. Fantastici. Una grandissima orchestra”  M° Valerio Gallihttps://youtu.be/9tNsryVZIJQ?t=1m58s “Le rivoluzioni camminano sulle gambe degli uomini. In questo caso su una corda, su un polpastrello, su un soffio”  Melania Petriello, giornalista e scrittrice “Orchestra ""made in Sud"", un miracolo di cultura e bellezza partito dal basso che ha il sapore dell'amicizia e che lega la musica all'idea di un futuro da costruire sull'impegno e sul talento” ANSA http://www.ansa.it/sito/notizie/cultura/musica/2015/08/08/orchestra-benevento-amicizia-fai-da-te_1de578c7-bc88-4be4-b40a-12bc5c327870.htmlOUR PROJECT Our dream is to set up a second season of 15 concerts, involving the full orchestra and with the collaboration of all the musicians and artists who have embraced the project, ready to support it by performing for free.SUPPORT US We are a self-financing orchestra, we have no funding yet, so far we have managed to achive our goals thanks to the passion and the strength of young musicians from many areas of Italy and with awareness of artists who embraced our cause. There are so many costs to setting up an orchestra season so big, so young and without funding. We need to buy chairs, lecterns, repay our trips and theater, staging, music and instrument’s rent, pay royalties and so more. Until now each purchase was supported by donations and the sacrifice of each musician. You can help us spread the music with your small contribution. We would like to work together providing uncommon italian music. Your little public funding would be very appreciated, allowing us to go on with our dream. We thank you in advance for your support and we hope to see you at the next Philharmonic Orchestra of Benevento’s concert.OUR CHALLENGEOur challenge is surviving after the crowdfunding campaign and gain the possibility to organize a second concert theater orchestra season. Our (and yours) effort is focalized to reach the goal to realize such dream and take part in many cultural tender notice for non-profit organizations.OUR HISTORY We are 70 young musicians aged between 18 and 27, members of the Philharmonic Orchestra of Benevento. It all begins in March 2015 with a young graduates musicians group wishful to found a youth and professional orchestra in their city and to travel the world! Step by step, the small group has taken advantage of the increasing collaboration of other musicians tied by same goals and dreams. So, to date, the orchestra is arrenged by over 70 members. We were confident of our strenght and passion, achiving our first concert season with our own economic effort, gaining the possibility to call such important and international artists as Maestro Francesco Ivan Ciampa, Maestro Valerio Galli, Maestro Sir Antonio Pappano, soprano Jessica Pratt, the dancer Josè Perez and many others. All the concerts were sold out. ""It is an orchestra full of talent, full of desire and determination. These are the projects that you have to carry on to grow the music culture""  Sir Antonio Pappano https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=102&v=B-pXgBjH2lI""The lifeblood of this Orchestra is the music love. Every effort, every difficulty becomes sound energy. I'm proud to guide these young artists."" M° Francesco Ivan Ciampa  ""These guys are great, I will come back whenever I can because it's really a joy to work with them. It’s a fantastic and great orchestra"".  M° Valerio Galli ""The revolutions walk on men legs. In this case on a rope, on a fingertip, on a breath""Melania Petriello, giornalist and writer “A made in South Orchestra, a miracle of culture and beauty linked together by a strong friendship and by the desire to build a future based on talent and responsability”.ANSAhttp://www.ansa.it/sito/notizie/cultura/musica/2015/08/08/orchestra-benevento-amicizia-fai-da-te_1de578c7-bc88-4be4-b40a-12bc5c327870.html",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<div><span style=""background-color: initial;""><b>I feel doubts arise as I write this. 'Maybe I'm too old or it's too late.' </b></span></div>
<div><b>Is it ever too late to chase dreams? </b></div>
<div><b><span style=""background-color: initial;"">When I play live, I feel the transmission from heart to heart. Sometimes, after a song, I look up and see tears in peoples' eyes and it trills in my soul. </span></b></div>
<div><b><span style=""background-color: initial;"">I want all of us to have more of THAT. So I'm doing what I can to create it. To 'be the change I wish to see in the world.' </span></b></div>
<div>

Hi! I'm Steven Budden (aka Saint Milkweed). For the past ten years, I've been tenderly crafting acoustic ballads for a handful of devoted fans. 

I live in a cabin up in the redwoods in Northern California  (I'll tell you how I got here in minute). 
This spring, I'm summoning all my courage and emerging from my cabin-retreat to bring my songs out into the world FOR THE FIRST TIME!
This is a HUGE leap for me... let me tell you why... 
""When you sing, I feel like I get a doorway into your heart and into the heart and soul of the world."" - Handwritten note from a beloved fan. 


Birth of 'Saint Milkweed' 


In 2008, I recorded my first album, 'Saint Milkweed' at Tiny Telephone Studios, on a shoestring budget, plunging myself into debt. It was fairly simple: just me, the guitar, and the harmonica. 
A few songs seem to be have an underground following on Pandora (Go to Hell, Caroline- I'm About to Fall, Couldn't Hold Onto You, for instance).  Royalties trickle in... enough to feed a moderately sized chicken or perhaps a large quail. 
I've received glowing letters from a few die-hard fans about how the album 'haunts them' and they have it on endless repeat. 
""I love that album, and hope you make more.  I could listen to it on a loop for hours.  It's seriously one of my ten or so favorites.  It's just so spare and beautiful, and makes me ache."" Facebook message from a fan
""One could argue that taste in music is subjective but I truly believe that, in a music industry overshadowed by consumerism, Steve Budden is one of our truly great songwriters"" - P. Parise

There are no Accidents
In 2009, as I was giddily planning a tour in the wake of that album,  I BROKE my NECK in the Pacific Ocean in a bodyboarding accident, and my life veered off in a whole new direction.   
The 'accident' brought out the healer in me. I became a somatic healer and a consultant on embodiment and healing, founding Flow Healing Arts in 2011. 
I also continued to write. An underground novel... 'The Flop Eared Gospels'. A healing manual: 'Flow: An Illuminated Training Manual.' Various articles, poetry, and music. 

Out of the Forest and Into the Fire



In 2014, I moved into a cabin in the forest with a partner. She was my main inspiration and my main audience. When she moved out, heart-wrenched, I retreated into the cabin to heal and write.Fate swept in. My cabin neighbor offered his recording set up at this critical hour (thank you D!) and I poured out recent songs onto a new album: Sweet Redemption. Bitter-sweet, much of it is about her. 



New Inspirations
Recently, at an intimate group event  (an Emerging and Evolving Economies JAM put on by an organization called YES!)... we were asked to  speak our deepest desire. 
""I want to start playing my music live and bring my songs out into the world. I want to live in a world where we are each celebrated for sharing our most precious gifts. Where music becomes a mode of connection."" 
Tears filled my eyes. Old fears flooded my mind. 
THIS campaign is me living into this ideal. Taking a leap into my higher self. 
  I'm inviting you to become an integral part of this unfolding and to share in the evolution of me as a musician and a man.

What You Get
The Intangibles:
The heart-warming feeling of knowing you contributed to making a dream come true. 
My eternal gratitude. 
First invitations to the shows. 
Some input to co-create the tour by suggesting towns and venues that excite you. Ie: A chance to bring the music to YOU. 
The Tangibles:
I've also put together some beautiful offerings for you, ranging from digital downloads of unreleased materials to hand-crafted gifts, a private house concert, and a musical hike / journey with me, healing sessions, attire.


'Saint Milkweed' Organic Cotton T, designed by me (men's version). That's the guitar I recorded my first album on. 


What the!? An organic baby bodysuit!? For the sheer hilarity and cuteness factor of it. 

If I am unable to reach my goal for whatever reason,... I will pour more energy into the tour and save the recording pieces for another date, as well as attempt to bring in funds from other sources to support the project. 
    The Impact
I am an idealist. I've created the music I love to create without a thought of it's commercial appeal. I record it bare bones, so there is nowhere to hide. This is, I think, the source of it's appeal as well as the reason I'm not more well known yet. 
Creating music underground for 20 years without much exposure to other musicians has been in interesting experience.Through this, my songwriting has evolved into a unique and very personal mode of expression. 
I'll write songs forever. I know that. However, I would LOVE if more people could actually hear these creations I pour so much love into. 
The next step in my journey is to bring my music to the world. To get out of the digital reality and go out and play for people like you in person. 
What this REPRESENTS is the dare to dream. 
I feel doubts arise as I write this. 'Maybe I'm too old or it's too late.' 
Is it ever too late to chase dreams? 
When I play live, I feel the transmission from heart to heart. Sometimes, after a song, I look up and see tears in peoples' eyes and it trills in my soul. 
I want all of us to have more of THAT. So I'm doing what I can to create it. To 'be the change I wish to see in the world.' 

Wherever possible, I'll try to keep the venues small and intimate, to foster that sense of connectedness. 

I truly need your support to move forward and to spread the music of love and redemption.    Confession
I notice I'm nervous, because without you, I know I could easily regress into my hermit songwriting mode- tenderly crafting passionate songs few hear.  
I'm also excited! Because with your support, I can move forward and deliver music you'll never forget. 
I'm humble during this process. I'm open to learning from other seasoned-touring musicians and from you. 

Surrender
The name Saint Milkweed came to me upon reading a Richard Wilbur poem:
""Anonymous as cherubsUnder the crib of God,White seeds are floatingOut of my burst pod.What power had IBefore I learned to yield?Shatter me, great wind:I shall possess the field""
This campaign represents is me 'surrendering,' and putting my faith in you. 
To spread the seed / songs, I just need a gentle breeze.

<p>In the spirit of true punk DIY, we're doing all the recording and mixing ourselves, with our own gear, in our own space.  Maria is an experienced sound engineer, and she's doing a fantastic job.  We get to spend as long as we want getting the songs perfect, and Rose can record 4-part harmonies on, like, everything.  Our goal is to get the music out there, tour and play shows, and generally keep the riotgrrl movement alive through our music.    </p> </div> <div> <h3>Why we're here</h3> <p>We launched this campaign to raise the money we need to actually press the album and make CDs.  (FYI, we're open to pressing vinyl too, if enough folks tell us they want records).  We'll also release the digital album for download in all the places (iTunes, Amazon, Spotify, Pandora, our Bandcamp site, somebody's Myspace, your mom's clock radio), along with digital versions of the artwork and lyrics.</p>
<p>We know most people only listen to music on their phones these days, but we also remember how cool it was to open a new CD and hold the liner notes in our hands.  We're going to include full lyrics to all our songs and all original artwork by Rose with this album.  We want folks to be able to touch the physical cardstock, and we want to be able to sign CDs at shows for anyone who wants one.  No jewel-cases though.  We're going with planet-friendly cardboard wallets with inserts. </p>
<p><b>The money will be used exactly like this:</b>    </p> <ul> <li>

<p><b>Short Summary:</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>My
name is Tom D’Ademo and I’ve been writing acoustic, singer-songwriter type
music under the pseudonym ""Me, Like Many"" for seven years. This campaign is aimed
to launch this project into another dimension in the form of getting it off the
ground and pushing it to the point where it’s visible to a mass amount. This
campaign is the attempt to reset the bar of popular music in both lyrical
content and instrumentation. </p>
<p><span>Your contribution will make you a partner in bringing
this album to fruition and help bring my music to the next level.<span>  We have some great perks for all levels of
contributions and we will all benefit from this project.  </span></span></p>
<p></p><b>What we need/What you get:</b>
<p>$30,000<span>  </span></p>
<p>Okay, so here’s
what we need to get this project done. This project is going to involve more
musicians, and technical production hours that it will cost around $30,000 to
produce, package &amp; promote.<span>  Our
producer is Vic Steffens of Horizon Music Group in West Haven, CT who also
recorded “In The Moment”, the first EP we released.  His knowledge and support, in my opinion, is
second to none.  We are really excited
about this project.  </span></p>
<p>Here’s an
estimate of how the costs break down:</p>
<p><span>·<span> 
</span></span><b>Recording
costs</b> = $10,000<br/>
<i>For studio time, gear, assisting engineers....<br/></i></p>
<p><span>·<span> 
</span></span><b>Mixing</b> = $3,000</p>
<p><span>·<span> 
</span></span><b>Mastering = </b>$1,000</p>
<p><span>·<span> 
</span></span><b>Artwork and
packaging design</b> = $1,500</p>
<p><span>·<span> 
</span></span><b>Web related
costs and Paypal fees</b> = $1,000</p>
<p><span>·<span> 
</span></span><b>Publicity</b> = $4,000</p>
<p><span>·<span>  </span></span><b>Exclusive Indiegogo CD</b> = $2,500</p>
<p><span>·<span>  </span></span><b>Exclusive Indiegogo Vinyl
LPs = </b>$3,500</p><p>·<span>  </span><b>Exclusive Indiegogo Poster = </b>$750<br/></p>
<p><span>·<span>  <b>Exclusive Indiegogo</b> </span></span><b>T-shirts</b> = $2,000</p>
<p><span>·<span> 
</span></span><b><b>Exclusive Indiegogo</b> Lyric Book =
</b>$750</p>
<p><b>Total Estimated Cost: $30,000</b></p>
<p>For contributing we have great lineup of perks that
include CD’s, Vinyl Records, T-shirts, a home concert, lyric book even a chance
to become an associate producer or even perform on a song. See the side bar for
details. </p>
<p>If we should exceed our goal, the money will go
toward marketing, touring, producing a video, music equipment &amp;
software.<span>  </span></p>
<p>We do not anticipate not making our goal, but if
that should happen, the funds raised will go toward getting the word out about
Me, Like Many and getting this project funded by hiring a promotion company to
help us.<span>  </span></p>
<p><b>The Impact:</b></p>
<p>It’s
not a secret that the composition of popular music has been dumbed down to four
chords and tired clichés that anyone with an elementary school diploma and a
pen can construct. In most cases, popular music lacks substance, depth, and
intelligence. It is our goal to reestablish these institutions into mainstream
media.<span>  We refuse to accept the norm that
simplicity is the only way into a successful career. We personally miss the days when the radio was
flooded with music that was written to evoke a feeling or thought rather than
just the urge to dance or blindly sing along. Whereas those songs are good to
have, it’s crucial to also involve well-constructed music into mainstream
mediums. At almost every show we play at, we have been told that the music we
play is a breath of fresh air in a stagnant room full of the same concepts. Our goal is to achieve this at an immensely
greater scale. If you agree with us, then please join us on our journey of creating
meaningful music with us and contribute. 
Let’s make beautiful music together.</span></p>
<p><b>Risks and Challenges: </b></p>
<p>With any
venture there are always risks.<span>  We have
a great team in place to help me to reduce the risks as we proceed to
production.  I’m not facing this venture
alone my team consists of my mom, a former VP of Finance who also worked in the
music business during her college years, my dad who has worked in the IT field,
owns his own real estate business and has many years’ experience with live and
recorded sound and Vic Steffens who has over 40 years’ experience in the music
business, will be producing this new album. 
My team which is in place, will keep the risks to a minimum, provide
support when we face challenges and can call upon advisers to overcome hurtles
that we may face.  </span></p>
<p><b>Other ways: </b></p>
<p></p>
<p>We know
that some of you may not be able to contribute, and that is OK, here is what
you can do to help…..please spread the word multiple times over the next few
weeks on your social media pages, tell your friends, neighbors and family to
become a fan and contribute.<span>  </span></p>

<span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">How &amp; Why it Started</span><br/>
</h3>
<p>A letter from the Universal House of Justice to all National Spiritual Assemblies dated 12 December, 2011, states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>""We long to see, for instance, the emergence of captivating songs from every part of the world, in every language, that will impress upon the consciousness of the young the profound concepts enshrined in the Baha’i teachings."" </i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>As someone who’s had the opportunity to travel a whole lot over the years, I’ve had the good fortune of attending a variety of different Baha’i-related gatherings around the world. One of the things I’ve enjoyed immensely while attending these gatherings, is being able to experience ""<i>the e</i><i>mergence of captivating songs from every part of the world, in every language"" </i>first hand!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I’ve always
wished others could hear these wonderful songs which celebrate the Writings of
the Baha'i Faith, and now with <i>Studio
Sessions</i> they can!</p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We've been releasing one <i>Studio Sessions</i> song per week (that's over 20 songs so far) and we've recorded in Sydney, Australia; Los Angeles, USA; Arequipa, Peru; London, UK; Toronto, Canada; the Gold Coast, Australia and Madrid, Spain.</p>
<p>The global response to these <i>Studio Sessions</i> has been absolutely amazing, and we've had a ton of great feedback from so many different people, but here's an example of one response which really sums it all up:</p>
<blockquote>
<i>""Just want to let you know how much I am enjoying the Baha'i Blog Studio Sessions. Every time we get a notification a new one has gone up, its the first thing I jump on YouTube to check.
I have seen friends using these prayers in their devotionals and this Sunday night we also used one of the prayers to start our devotional. They are really useful to the teaching work underway as well. I think as more friends start to engage with these prayers others will be inspired to craft their own prayers or pick up a guitar to learn these prayers within their own clusters as we have seen already in some of the comments. 
Anyways just want to say to the team keep up great work and I hope this series will continue on for the foreseeable future, traveling to more and more countries!""</i> -Chad</blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>As we want
these songs to serve as a resource for you and communities around the world,
every song we release includes the lyrics and the chords so you can learn to
play them as well. We do hope this initiative encourages the use of music in
communities around the world and inspires others to create their own songs.</p>
<br/><h3>How You Can Help</h3>
<p>We have enough songs recorded to take us to the end of the 2015, and we'd really like to be able to continue <i>Studio Sessions</i> into the future, but getting people into a studio and filming and recording them isn't always that easy - or cheap.</p>
<p>So far <i>Studio Sessions</i> has been possible thanks to the help of volunteers, and because we've been digging into our own pockets, but unfortunately doing things this way is simply not sustainable.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Since we
don’t generate any income through advertising (and we don't want to do this - can
you imagine having to listen to an ad before listening to a beautiful prayer?),
and we also don’t want to charge anyone for these wonderful songs either, we're
asking for your help to make sure we can keep <i>Studio Sessions</i> going.  </p>
<p>Based on our
experience, and excluding our time and the generous help of volunteers, we've
calculated that if we had to pay for everything else, each <i>Studio Session</i> song
would cost on average US$250. So, to have 52 songs will cost a total of
US$13,000. I know this may sound like a lot, but it goes towards things
like studio room hire, sound engineer hire, hire of a camera person to film and
edit, some travel expenses (for instance sometimes we have to help artists to
come in from certain parts of a country which isn't always that cheap), and
other bits-and-pieces like hard drives to store all the footage.</p>
<p>And remember!
The above covers both the video and audio production, which are FREE to
download and available online as long as the internet exists! ;)</p>
<p>Any funds
raised in excess of what is needed will be put aside for <i>Studio
Sessions</i> 2017 and the years beyond. </p>
<br/><h3>What's in it for You?</h3>
<p>Most crowd funding campaigns provide those contributing  with rewards or perks for their contributions, but after discussing this at length, the team at Baha'i Blog decided that we are going to keep the perks very simple, and I'll explain why:</p>
<p>We feel like the production and release of these <i>Studio Sessions</i> to the world ARE the reward, and this is the product we're offering. It's not a CD, a slick suitcase or a belt buckle - it's a collection of songs based on the Baha'i Writings made available for FREE on YouTube and SoundCloud for millions of people to listen to and use.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, we thought about creating t-shirts, we thought about producing a CD; but then we calculated the cost and time this would take, and we quickly realised that would increase the cost, and would take away from the limited time we have to dedicate to this very important initiative. 
Additionally, things like creating a CD and shipping it would not only add up cost-wise, but could also have legal and copyright issues with those wonderful individuals who have contributed their music for free to this initiative. We'd like to try and keep this initiative as simple and straightforward as possible, ensuring that the music is always free. As a result, we decided to give everyone who makes a contribution a digital copy of the most listened to <i>Studio Sessions</i> song of 2016 as a token of our appreciation. The main reward therefore, is the sharing of this beautiful Baha'i-inspired music from around the world - with the whole world!</p>
<br/><h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you can't contribute to <i>Studio Sessions</i> financially, that's totally cool, but we’d really appreciate it if you could help us by doing the following:</p>
<p>1.  Help spread the word and let others know about this campaign.</p>
<p>2. <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_wNlQnJNP8LRAhjGF3ZLKA/feed"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Subscribe to Baha’i Blog’s YouTube Channel</a> so we can share with you all the new <i>Studio Sessions</i> as they're released.</p>

I'm looking into a few studios and working with a few producers but it's not always easy to read who has honest intention and who is only willing to work with you because of where it could get them.

</div><div>The other biggest challenge here is time. I've got songs that are a few months old that are already no longer relevant to my life today but that still fit the theme of the project.

If I don't reach my goal by the deadline I've outlined there's a good chance that what finally comes out is gonna be very far from the original vision.

<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1442555410/mnnxvveumxv2yjirlftv.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/><p>After launching our first collection ""Wahala"" in 2013; inspired by the bright, bold and eclectic aspects of our African heritage, we received such an amazing response and just managed to break even. As with most new projects, the first couple of years are crucial and hence we decided to put the costs back into the label, find ourselves an office and get the 2nd collection up and running. </p>
<p>SheKudo is passionate about Sydney and the abundance of emerging and established creatives we have in this city and we are not looking to take our production anywhere else. This city has shaped so much of who we are and we want to share that with the world. In this collection entitled ""Laguna Colorada"" we have collaborated with two local Sydney artists to create our fabric designs; <i>Mulga The Artist</i> and <i>Daniella Argenta</i>.</p>
<p>We are hoping this campaign will give us the extra help that we need to launch our second collection ""Laguna Colorada"" and provide us with a leg up to cover fabric supply, digital printing and manufacturing costs  as producing at on home soil can be super costly as we all know.</p>

</div></div>","Short Summary Howdy and thanks for stopping by! SheKudo is a Sydney based label which started up between two pals who have been wreaking havoc since 1998.


After launching our first collection ""Wahala"" in 2013; inspired by the bright, bold and eclectic aspects of our African heritage, we received such an amazing response and just managed to break even. As with most new projects, the first couple of years are crucial and hence we decided to put the costs back into the label, find ourselves an office and get the 2nd collection up and running. 
SheKudo is passionate about Sydney and the abundance of emerging and established creatives we have in this city and we are not looking to take our production anywhere else. This city has shaped so much of who we are and we want to share that with the world. In this collection entitled ""Laguna Colorada"" we have collaborated with two local Sydney artists to create our fabric designs; Mulga The Artist and Daniella Argenta.
We are hoping this campaign will give us the extra help that we need to launch our second collection ""Laguna Colorada"" and provide us with a leg up to cover fabric supply, digital printing and manufacturing costs  as producing at on home soil can be super costly as we all know.








What We Need & What You Get We want to be able to deliver affordable high quality pieces which continue to transcend trends and time. Pieces that you can buy for that catch up dinner with the mates  and then to be able to pull it out again 3 years later for that visit to your mother-in-law's (eeek). Based on personal experience -- affordable, quality pieces aren't always easy to come by - and to have a taste of something truly unique, you're forced to dig deep in the wallet or head to the thrift store to keep things interesting. 
SheKudo looks to become a staple in the wardrobes of trendsetters worldwide with each piece making the wearer feel authentic, confident and comfortable in their own crazy.
Every contribution counts and even if you can't support us financially, please take the time to mention it to a mate - that is a gift within itself. You can donate with the intention of receiving something in return - or you can simply just make a donation.

Wahala Wax Notebooks *please note they come in a variety of prints, due to this we can't guarantee which print you will get



Limited edition Mulga Magnets *not all magnets are shown here, artworks will vary

<p><b>Do you hear that sound?</b></p><p>I read somewhere that owls hoot to search for a mate, to mark their territory, or to locate their babies. Well, babies, we’re hooting at you.</p>
<p>Hi. I’m Little Sara, from Little Sara and the Night Owls. We are a Seattle based band with a collective century of experience in the music world, bringing you a selection of classic blues and soul songs. Our first hoot was delivered loud and proud to attract our mates, the members of our parliament: Kenny “Dr. Sax” Mandell on woodwinds and percussion, “Reverend” Al Walker on guitar, Dennis “Dr. Stax” Staskowski on bass, Donny “Chesterfield” Berman on drums, and me, “Little” Sara Depp, on vocals. And we’ve been marking our territory all around town, in Seattle venues such as Egan’s, Couth Buzzard Books, The Angry Beaver, the Park Public House, and at large events like the Greenwood Car Show, the Bellevue Strawberry Festival, and Olympia’s Music in the Park series in Sylvester Park. All that’s left is to locate you, babies, because we need your help.</p>
<p>The life of a musician is a lot like the life of an owl: majestic, adventurous, largely nocturnal…and not exactly financially lucrative. In order to keep bringing you the booty-shakin’, ear-caressin’, high-energy shows we’ve become known for, <b>we need a good PA system</b>. Right now we are using old, out-of-date equipment that’s quite frankly about to go the way of another famous bird — the dodo. We want our sound equipment to let our voices and instruments ring clear and bright. And we’d like to ask you for your help in making that happen.</p>
<p><b>$2000 will allow us to buy a quality PA, which means at future shows we will be able to play music for you that sounds the way it should.</b> The way you remember. A sound that does justice to the long and storied traditions of blues and soul. We are so appreciative of the support of our fans, friends and family. <b>We would be grateful for any dollar amount, and if you’re not able to donate financially at this time, we ask that you share this video on social media to help spread the word.</b></p>
<p>Thank you in advance, Owlets, and hoot hoot! We look forward to playing for you soon.</p><p><b>MORE PERKS ARE COMING!!!!</b></p><div></div></div>","Do you hear that sound?I read somewhere that owls hoot to search for a mate, to mark their territory, or to locate their babies.

<p><span>While producing guitars is our main focus, we also hope to have a positive impact on our community and support musical arts programs. As fellow musicians, we understand the importance of supporting music programs geared towards children and young adults, and believe they play a vital part in youth development. During our campaign if we surpass our $10,000 goal, we will donate a guitar to The Record Co. The Record Co. is a Dorchester, MA nonprofit, whose goal is to build a sustainable, nationally recognized modern music scene in Boston. The Record Co. does this through several programs engaging inner-city youth who would not otherwise have access to music and audio recording services. During the campaign, we will release charitable stretch goals, and continue to donate one Muze at a time to worthy organizations (such as this one) that support the musical arts!</span><br/></p>

It is gonna be a pop-rock and  the first music video is scheduled for early June. Each of us contributes a small portion of the money. But in general, the total price of the music video - 15 thousand dollars.We also have a business plan, marketing promotion plan. And we can promise you  to BORN a wonderful music coming from our hearts!
    The Impact 
I truly believe that with the popularity comes great responsibility. I took part in the x factor in my country some years ago and then fell on me a little popularity.I saw how a generation younger than me absorb the role  model behavior of their favorite artists and musicians. SO great to be an inspiration and to give the right direction !? Dont you think so?
Risks & Challenges 
In the world there are millions of obstacles, interference on the way to a dream!Actually I can not get a visa before coming to the music video.But let's be optimistic! Right now I feel as if I am on the threshold of something new and cool! So perhaps even monkeys-Zombie invasion can not stop me!:DIM JUST KIDDING! Of course everything in God's hands!
Other Ways You Can Help If you dont have a opportunity with money!! Sooo wheteveer.. We love you anyway!! Just remember us and join our music latter!)) Also tell all the world about us and follow our instagram to know all the breaking news!!! YO

<b>Kaos Skola Festival 22.+23. July 2016<br/>Horn - Sweden 
A few words about the next Kaos Skola Festival :) All of those who
 joined us last year, have an idea of what to expect already, but we are
 hoping to see many new faces.<br/><br/>A bit about us: We are a small 
family, we live in the beautiful South of Sweden and we simply thought 
that we should use the freedom and space for something amazing and one 
of a kind, to bring creative people together and simply enjoy a good 
time. Music had to play a big role, it should be family-friendly, rather
 hyppyish, and some good food (100 % vegan) was on the plan…and that's 
exactly what we did. Our Expectations were totally topped, the Kaos 
Skola Festival 2015 was absolutely brilliant, wonderful and we can't 
resist repeating it.<br/><br/>All that not just for fun but for a good 
cause? Impossibe - nah…totally possible! We donated all profits to 2 
charitable causes (an amazing 1200,-). And this will, of course, also be
 the case at the next festival. Maybe we can even top the amount? If you
 want to enter your organisation as a recipient of the profits, feel 
free to get in touch!<br/><br/>About the location: We have a yard of 5000 
square meters, which offers a lot of space for many activities. It is 
quiet but not completely cut off. A 3 minute walk gets you to the lake 
for a nice swim.<br/><br/>Accommodation: Camping in our yard, on the 
neighbour's lawn, at the lake or in the forest. The choice is yours. We 
will also improve the sanitary facilities but please don't expect 5 
stars ;)<br/><br/>Also: Dogs will be present, be prepared.<br/><br/>And: Kids until 12 yrs are free!<br/><br/><br/>                                                          *** Music ***<br/><br/> *** MATZE ROSSI *** JAWKNEE MUSIC *** TIGERYOUTH *** JOHN ALLEN*** KINGA DULA *** MARCEL GEIN *** MATES *** AND:I *** CHAPLIN *** ANDREAS LIEBERT *** CATCH: firefly *** NICOLE CARTER CASH *** STEVEN&amp; STANLEY *** FREDDY FUDD PUCKER  *** PLANTYOGI *** PHIL HUTZON *** *** BEN BARRITT *** HERR LEHMANN ***ANDISOLO *** How I left *** ADOLFINA FUCK ***<br/><br/><b>Kaos Skola Festival 22.+23.

 ein paar Worte zum nächsten Kaos Skola Festival :) Diejenigen, die 
letztes Jahr dabei waren wissen ja schon in etwa was es zu erwarten 
gibt, wir hoffen aber auch auf viele neue Gesichter.<br/><br/>Erstmal zu 
uns: Wir sind eine kleine Familie, wohnen im schönen Südschweden und 
haben uns irgendwann gedacht, dass man das Stückchen Freiheit und Platz 
nutzen sollte um was Verrücktes zu tun, interessante kreative Menschen 
zusammen zu bringen und einfach eine gute Zeit zu verleben. *** Musik 
*** sollte eine grosse Rolle spielen, es sollte familienfreundlich sein,
 eher hippiemässig, noch dazu war gutes Essen geplant ( 100% vegan )... 
tja, also haben wir das einfach mal gemacht, unsere Erwartungen wurden 
auch noch total übertroffen, das Kaos Skola Festival 2015 war absolut 
genial, wunderschön und wir können garnicht anders als es zu 
wiederholen.<br/><br/>Und dann noch was Gutes tun? Geht nicht- klar, geht!
 Wir haben im letzten Jahr den kompletten Gewinn an 2 gemeinnützige 
Vereine gespendet ( immerhin 1200,- ), das wird auch dieses Jahr der 
Fall sein, und vielleicht wird es dann ja auch ein wenig mehr. Vereine 
dürfen sich auch gerne bei uns melden, für dieses Jahr sind noch nicht 
alle Begünstigten ausgewählt.<br/><br/>Zur Umgebung: Wir haben ein 
Grundstück von 5000qm2 was auf jeden Fall Platz für einige Aktivitäten 
lässt, es ist ruhig gelegen, aber nicht völlig abgeschieden, in 3 
Minuten ist man beim See wo man wundervoll baden kann.<br/><br/>Unterbringung:
 Entweder auf unserem Grundstück oder auf Nachbars Weide zelten ist 
möglich, man kann auch am See zelten oder im Wald, das steht jedem frei.
 Wir werden auch die sanitären Anlagen etwas verbessern, man darf aber 
dennoch keine 5 Sterne erwarten ;)<br/><br/>Sonst: es werden einige Hunde anwesend sein, da muss man mit zurecht kommen :)<br/>Und übrigens: Kinder bis 12 Jahre feiern umsonst mit!</b><p></p>

<h3>To Sum Things Up</h3>
<p>For those of you who may not know me, my name is Tricia Wolf. I came to own MAD PLAID MUSIC through unfortunate circumstances. As they say - when life hands you lemons, make lemonade!</p>
<ul>
<li>Small businesses are the fabric that America is made of. Sadly, many struggle to stay stay alive. Local, family-owned music stores are a dying breed. Fortunately, Antioch is a community blessed enough to have a music store right on Main Street in the downtown business district. Our music store provides lessons to close to 200 students per week. We provide the rental instruments for the local band programs. We also have a retail shop and consignment sales, as well as repair services for instruments. We are your one-stop-shop for all of your musical needs.</li>
<li>Our goal is to expand our product lines to have on-hand inventory of day-to-day items (such as guitar strings and accessories and band accessories) as well as major purchase items such as guitars, amplifiers and digital pianos. We are looking to expand our current guitar line and digital piano line and to add on a supplier for amplifiers and drum products! You can be a part of that!</li>
</ul>
<p>Our goal is to be able to have you walk out with the product you came in for!</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>To break it down:</p>
<ul>
<li>As I've mentioned we need a paint job - both exterior paint as well as the basement area where the lesson rooms are - AND our bathroom needs some work as well!</li>
<li>Our product line needs expansion! Drums, amps, guitars ... and how awesome would it be to have a few band instruments for sale on the wall? Most of the vendors that we work with have what they call a ""minimum buy in"" for example, the amp line we are looking at has a buy in of $4000 (that's just to get my foot in the door with them.) My one guitar line had a buy in of $2500, several other vendors buy in amounts are $600, $800, etc. - all just so I can place a beginning order so I can carry their products.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What do you get for helping?</strong> Aside from the satisfaction of supporting a small business, you also get recognition within the store in the form of either a music themed plaque or crystal star award and a personalized thank you from MAD PLAID MUSIC.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>While it may not seem like much - a facelift to the store is essential. The new paint job and carpeting (which is imperative at this point) while go a long way to improve the esthetics of the store. It is always nicer to shop in a store that is pleasing to the senses.</p>
<p>We are also looking to improve lesson rooms with better sound-proofing materials, update some of the products used in the lesson rooms, and update the carpeting and furniture in the waiting room area. We would also like to increase the size of the waiting room and create a large group practice room!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>It has been an uphill battle from the start - and we continue to fight. Aside from fighting Big Box stores, online shopping sites and the economy in general - we are also fighting a legal battle.  We are doing all that we can to remain open to continue to provide our community and the surrounding communities with music lessons, rental programs for the local school districts and retail products for your convenience.</p>

sensations we are conscious of. They are often referred to as the
phenomenal properties of experience and experiences that have qualia are
referred to as being phenomenally conscious.<div>  

<p>The qualia problem has to
do with the communication of feelings. How can someone describe green to a
colorblind person? Which is the same as the problem of the self. The person
who experiences the qualia can reflect on their qualia. There's is a
subjective experience of experiencing them and a peculiar solipsistic quality
to it. </p>Those two problems are like
the two sides of a coin. You cannot understand one without simultaneously
understanding  other. It is uniquely human to have the sense of self, the
sense of a future and the self being able to inspect the information coming in. </div><div>We create mental representations of the representations, which allows us to

We aim to record Qualia in
September 2016. Recording can be a very demanding process that requires a
lot of different stages. From studio time, mixing and mastering  to printing and designing the album, in order to achieve our
creative goals, there is a line of people working for this project and this is
your chance to be a part of our team! 
Reaching our goal in our Indiegogo campaign would provide the necessary funds for a high quality production and guarantee releasing Qualia by the end of 2016.For more info about Terry

QualiaQualia are the
sensations we are conscious of. They are often referred to as the
phenomenal properties of experience and experiences that have qualia are
referred to as being phenomenally conscious.  

The qualia problem has to
do with the communication of feelings. How can someone describe green to a
colorblind person? Which is the same as the problem of the self. The person
who experiences the qualia can reflect on their qualia. There's is a
subjective experience of experiencing them and a peculiar solipsistic quality
to it. Those two problems are like
the two sides of a coin. You cannot understand one without simultaneously
understanding  other. It is uniquely human to have the sense of self, the
sense of a future and the self being able to inspect the information coming in. We create mental representations of the representations, which allows us to
manipulate symbols internally in our heads and intimately lead to things
like... meaning.V.S Ramachandran




·  "" ..one of
the central questions of our existence , How do subjective feelings/How does
consciousness enter into the world? Through your head is obviously the answer.
But that answer is not very helpful. What about the brain inside your head that

<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">In a nutshell</span><br/>
</h3>
<div>Many of you know me as Katie Colpitts and some of you may know me as Katie Cash. I am a native San Francisco Bay Area musician and have passionately dedicated my life to pursuing the things that I love most; writing, playing and performing music.  Over the years I have worked on and released several albums with my rock bands but now it's time for me to release my first solo album.</div>
<div>While this record is a solo project, it is strongly based in community.  Staying true to my original vision, I have already started working with several different artists, musicians and engineers to help bring this album to life.<br/>
</div>
<div>The vision of this project started several years ago.  I began working on recordings and demos with various members of my Bay Area musical community to piece together a body of work.  In 2012, I put this project on hold after deciding to go back to school to study music composition at <a href=""http://www.mills.edu"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Mills College</a>.  While at Mills, I had the great privilege of studying with the extraordinarily brilliant music department: <a href=""https://sites.google.com/site/maggipayne/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Maggi Payne</a>, <a href=""http://www.nalinig.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Dr. Nalini Ghuman</a>, <a href=""http://cbmuse.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Chris Brown</a>, <a href=""http://www.johnbischoff.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">John Bischoff</a>, <a href=""http://www.jamesfei.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">James Fei</a>, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Schmidt"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Daniel Schmidt</a>, and in my final semester<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">, an independent study with <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Frith"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Fred Frith</a>.  Through my </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">study with Fred, I focused on this album and was able to develop my vision in terms of composition, arrangement, and
overall scope. </span><br/>
</div>
<div>Once I felt my body of work was strong enough to present to my ideal choice of producer, I set the wheels in motion to take the next steps toward realizing this dream.<br/>
</div>
<div>I am honored, excited and humbled to have <a href=""http://juliewolfmusic.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Julie Wolf</a>, of <i>Julie Wolf Music</i>, producing this record and to be tracking with <a href=""http://www.adammunoz.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Adam Muñoz</a> at <a href=""http://fantasystudios.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Fantasy Studios</a> in Berkeley, CA.<br/>
</div>
<div>With your help, I can continue moving forward with pre production and start getting some dates on the calendar with Fantasy Studios to track the record. The entire project will be possible with donations and support from all of you!  <br/>
</div>
<div> </div> </div> <div> <h3>Breakdown</h3> <p>I am raising $28,000 to go directly into this project.</p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Here is a breakdown of exactly where the funds will be going:</span></p>
<p></p>
<p>Producer, Musicians, Studio <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">(Tracking/Overdubs/Editing/Mixing/Mastering):  $27,925</span></p>
<p>Piano Tuning: $150</p>
<p>Pressing (Vinyl/CDs): $3700</p>
<p>Digital Distribution: $100</p>
<p>Campaign Video/Gear: $1500</p>
<p>You might be thinking that this total is larger than what I am trying to raise in this campaign, and you're right. I have already received a generous donation of $5000 toward my project!</p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">I'm really excited about some of the perks and exclusives I am able to offer as part of the campaign. Limited edition colored vinyl, VIP tickets to the record release show, and downloads of the album before it's released are just a few items that are up for grabs!</span></p>
<p>We are aiming to track in May/June and release the record in Fall/Winter of 2016. Turn around time for vinyl is about 16 weeks at this point, so that is why the official release will drop so many months after tracking the record.<br/></p>
</div><div>
<p><span style=""font-size: 24px;font-weight: bold;""><br/></span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 24px;font-weight: bold;"">A Dream Come True</span></p>
<p>This project holds a very special place in my heart.  I have worked hard and diligently over the years to support my musical career and to grow as a musician every day.  <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">I have had the incredible opportunity to work with such a diverse group of talented artists and I am honored to be supported by such an incomparable team and community.  This project is an extension of myself and an expression of my gratitude for everyone that has ever supported independent artists.</span></p>

Many of you know me as Katie Colpitts and some of you may know me as Katie Cash. I am a native San Francisco Bay Area musician and have passionately dedicated my life to pursuing the things that I love most; writing, playing and performing music.  Over the years I have worked on and released several albums with my rock bands but now it's time for me to release my first solo album.
While this record is a solo project, it is strongly based in community.  Staying true to my original vision, I have already started working with several different artists, musicians and engineers to help bring this album to life.

The vision of this project started several years ago.  I began working on recordings and demos with various members of my Bay Area musical community to piece together a body of work.  In 2012, I put this project on hold after deciding to go back to school to study music composition at Mills College.  While at Mills, I had the great privilege of studying with the extraordinarily brilliant music department: Maggi Payne, Dr. Nalini Ghuman, Chris Brown, John Bischoff, James Fei, Daniel Schmidt, and in my final semester, an independent study with Fred Frith.  Through my study with Fred, I focused on this album and was able to develop my vision in terms of composition, arrangement, and
overall scope. 

Once I felt my body of work was strong enough to present to my ideal choice of producer, I set the wheels in motion to take the next steps toward realizing this dream.

I am honored, excited and humbled to have Julie Wolf, of Julie Wolf Music, producing this record and to be tracking with Adam Muñoz at Fantasy Studios in Berkeley, CA.

With your help, I can continue moving forward with pre production and start getting some dates on the calendar with Fantasy Studios to track the record. The entire project will be possible with donations and support from all of you!  

    Breakdown I am raising $28,000 to go directly into this project.
Here is a breakdown of exactly where the funds will be going:

Producer, Musicians, Studio (Tracking/Overdubs/Editing/Mixing/Mastering):  $27,925
Piano Tuning: $150
Pressing (Vinyl/CDs): $3700
Digital Distribution: $100
Campaign Video/Gear: $1500
You might be thinking that this total is larger than what I am trying to raise in this campaign, and you're right. I have already received a generous donation of $5000 toward my project!
I'm really excited about some of the perks and exclusives I am able to offer as part of the campaign. Limited edition colored vinyl, VIP tickets to the record release show, and downloads of the album before it's released are just a few items that are up for grabs!
We are aiming to track in May/June and release the record in Fall/Winter of 2016. Turn around time for vinyl is about 16 weeks at this point, so that is why the official release will drop so many months after tracking the record.


A Dream Come True
This project holds a very special place in my heart.  I have worked hard and diligently over the years to support my musical career and to grow as a musician every day.  I have had the incredible opportunity to work with such a diverse group of talented artists and I am honored to be supported by such an incomparable team and community.  This project is an extension of myself and an expression of my gratitude for everyone that has ever supported independent artists.

    
You can help just by sharing this campaign!
Even if you are not in a position to donate, sharing this campaign with anyone you think might be interested or sharing the link on social media would be a HUGE help!
You can use IndieGoGo's share tools to help spread the word.   Thank you for all of your consideration and support!Recognition & Credits:

<p>We are one of those who were also part of that get-together, and today

Daugavpils has always been distinguished by the presence of sympathetic
friends, acquaintances and good, selfless people, without whose help this event
is unlikely to happen. We managed to find some of the best musicians of our
city, most of which have long lived outside Latvia, but they will come
specially for this event.</p>

<div>My name is Sarah Chapman, and I am the lead singer/songwriter for Ghost Cat Attack.  I have been making music, since childhood.  Starting on the piano and flute as a child, I  joined choir in high school and at 16 years old, I picked up the guitar.  My love of poetry and music made songwriting a natural fit, but it was years before I took my songs beyond the coffeehouse/open mic setting.  I<span style=""background-color: initial;""> spent my 20's modeling, acting and trying my hand at nearly every kind of ""day-job"" I thought I could stomach.  In 2014 I played a fictional pop-star for a play with the Black Theater Troupe.  After singing someone else's songs as if they were my own, I decided I didn't want to pretend anymore.  I </span><span style=""background-color: initial;"">had to admit that I had a whole album already written, just waiting to be born.  </span>
</div>
<div>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">In January of 2015, I set about finding a band to help bring my songs to life. I found them in the hotbed of talent that is the Arizona music scene at open mics and even on craigslist.  Eventually we formed as Ghost Cat Attack and played our first show in April of 2015.  </span><span style=""background-color: initial;"">After one year of playing out</span><span style=""background-color: initial;""> locally around Phoenix, Scottsdale and Tempe, Arizona, we have built up our fan-base</span><span style=""background-color: initial;""> and tightened up the songs.  Now, we are ready to put out a quality product and</span><span style=""background-color: initial;""> take this project to the next level.  We want to record an EP  that is radio worthy and get our songs out to the world.  This will allow us to start generating revenue and fund our first tour. </span>
</div>
<div><span style=""background-color: initial;""><br/></span></div>
<div><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Meet The Band:</span></div>
<div><span style=""background-color: initial;""><p>Emmanuel Aube is a native of Normandy in France. He has played guitar since the age of 12 inspired by Brian May, Slash, The Doors, Jimmy Page, Hendrix...He made his first studio recording at the age 16 with a local metal band. Studied briefly at the conservatory &amp; MAI in Nancy, France before he moved to Phoenix in 2008. He played with the JJ'S band for 4-5 years, as well as Hot Birds and the Chili Sauce, and now pursues his solo projects while he collaborates with various artists, such as Ghost Cat Attack.</p>
<p>Andrea Gudeyon began studying music at age six with formal piano lessons. Throughout her school years in Wisconsin, she learned every instrument she could get her hands on. At 17, she fell in love—with the bass. Shortly after, she started her first garage band and moved to Los Angeles to pursue the music dream. That dream was short, but opportunities led her to Phoenix where she studied audio production. She currently works as a sound engineer in theatre, studio recording and live events. She also plays bass with Jenny Jarnagin. Sarah invited Andrea to sit-in with Ghost Cat Attack in the fall of 2015 and they have been making music magic happen ever since.</p>
<p>Lou Perez is originally a New York native who has been living in Arizona about 11 years now. He fell in love with drums at the ripe old age of 8 and has been playing on and off since then, but more consistently over the past 8 years. His musical influences are diverse and he tries to incorporate many genres into his playing. With a background in Metal and Punk, Lou has expanded his skills to show a softer side in joining Ghost Cat Attack. </p></span></div>
<div><span style=""background-color: initial;""><br/></span></div>
<div><span style=""background-color: initial;"">This is our passion, our purpose, and lifelong dream.  I have an amazing band who are ready to follow me around the country playing my songs and helping me reach my goals.  It would mean everything if you could help make this dream a reality.  I believe you can.  </span></div>
<div><span style=""background-color: initial;""><br/></span></div> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<div><br/></div>
<div>We are asking for $10,000 to cover 2-3 weeks of studio time, mixing, mastering, reproduction, distribution, PR, promotion, and tour support to get us on the road promoting this album and playing our hearts out for you.  This is what we want to be doing for a living, full time.  But we need the tools to build this business.  With your help, I know we can make this EP a huge success.</div>
<div>We have so many amazing perks for you from an advanced download of our first single for as little as a $5 contribution -to having us travel anywhere in the United States to play a private party for you and your friends and a whole lot of cool stuff in between.  I feel that the local music community here in Arizona has been huge in helping our band find it's groove and so we would like to give some perks with them in mind.  Such as:</div>
<div><br/></div>
<ul> <li>One lucky donor will take home a painting of a Ghost Cat Attack painted by the very talented singer/songwriter/artist extraordinaire Hannah Bones (previously of Doctor Bones).  <br/>
</li>
<li>2 signed guitars, one of which was signed by Ghost Cat Attack (BIG THANKS TO BIZARRE GUITAR for the hookup!) and one of which has been autographed by all of the amazing artists who played our fundraiser show:  The Banter, Dirty Sunset, Ben Anderson, Carol Pacey &amp; the Honey Shakers, Ghost Cat Attack, Japhy's Descent, Woodworks, Jeanne &amp; the Beat, Hannah Bones, Manny Tripodis, Ronnie Winters, &amp; Jess Pruitt.  This is a collectors item for any die-hard music fan. <br/>
</li>
<li>Several gift cards to local music venues, such as: Rogue Bar, Pho Cao, Terroir Wine Pub, Twisted Lizard and Stinkweeds record store.</li>
<li>2 hours of practice time at Bomb Shelter Rehearsal Studio where GCA practices</li>
<li>2 lessons with our guitar player Emmanuel Aube</li>
<li>A chance to be in the music video for our firs single.</li> </ul>
<div><br/></div>
<div>With even half of our goal met ($5,000) we will still be able to get the songs recorded and released digitally, it will just take more time to get the songs out there to the fans.  We'll release the EP digitally on Bandcamp, Amazon, I-tunes &amp; Spotify, etc... to fund the reproduction of physical CDs, and eventually a tour to support the EP beyond our local market.  We will continue with our grassroots approach, returning to the local radio stations and other social media outlets, and most of all word of mouth to promote this music.  Either way, we will have a quality product worth putting out there, even if we don't have the help of a publicist, PR firm or distribution company.</div>
<div><br/></div> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3>
<ul>
</ul>
<div>I believe that music from the heart, feeds the heart.  This music is from my heart to yours.  It has come from growing up in Arizona, surrounded by the beauty of the desert &amp; the madness of the music scene.  It has been inspired by the search for love, meaning and belonging.  I hope that it will bring you joy, or comfort, or perhaps just simply a release.</div>
<div>In preparation to launch this campaign, we put on a very successful fundraiser show with 8 other bands volunteering their services and raised over $400 towards this project in just one night!  This is a music community that believes in us and is ready to see us take the next step.  I hope you will join them in that belief and contribute to this album.</div>
<div>All 4 members of Ghost Cat Attack take this project very seriously and are ready to make it our full time job.  We see this campaign as a way to raise seed money for the business that is our band.  This investment, will allow us to create our product and give us the capital we need to get it off the ground. </div>

Thank you so much for having taken the time to check out our campaign and feel free to listen to the songs we recorded for free last year, on: <a href=""http://www.soundcloud.com/ghostcatattack"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.soundcloud.com/ghostcatattack</a>
</div>
</div></div>","My name is Sarah Chapman, and I am the lead singer/songwriter for Ghost Cat Attack.  I have been making music, since childhood.  Starting on the piano and flute as a child, I  joined choir in high school and at 16 years old, I picked up the guitar.  My love of poetry and music made songwriting a natural fit, but it was years before I took my songs beyond the coffeehouse/open mic setting.  I spent my 20's modeling, acting and trying my hand at nearly every kind of ""day-job"" I thought I could stomach.  In 2014 I played a fictional pop-star for a play with the Black Theater Troupe.  After singing someone else's songs as if they were my own, I decided I didn't want to pretend anymore.  I had to admit that I had a whole album already written, just waiting to be born.  


In January of 2015, I set about finding a band to help bring my songs to life. I found them in the hotbed of talent that is the Arizona music scene at open mics and even on craigslist.  Eventually we formed as Ghost Cat Attack and played our first show in April of 2015.  After one year of playing out locally around Phoenix, Scottsdale and Tempe, Arizona, we have built up our fan-base and tightened up the songs.  Now, we are ready to put out a quality product and take this project to the next level.  We want to record an EP  that is radio worthy and get our songs out to the world.  This will allow us to start generating revenue and fund our first tour. 


Meet The Band:
Emmanuel Aube is a native of Normandy in France. He has played guitar since the age of 12 inspired by Brian May, Slash, The Doors, Jimmy Page, Hendrix...He made his first studio recording at the age 16 with a local metal band. Studied briefly at the conservatory & MAI in Nancy, France before he moved to Phoenix in 2008. He played with the JJ'S band for 4-5 years, as well as Hot Birds and the Chili Sauce, and now pursues his solo projects while he collaborates with various artists, such as Ghost Cat Attack.
Andrea Gudeyon began studying music at age six with formal piano lessons. Throughout her school years in Wisconsin, she learned every instrument she could get her hands on. At 17, she fell in love—with the bass. Shortly after, she started her first garage band and moved to Los Angeles to pursue the music dream. That dream was short, but opportunities led her to Phoenix where she studied audio production. She currently works as a sound engineer in theatre, studio recording and live events. She also plays bass with Jenny Jarnagin. Sarah invited Andrea to sit-in with Ghost Cat Attack in the fall of 2015 and they have been making music magic happen ever since.
Lou Perez is originally a New York native who has been living in Arizona about 11 years now. He fell in love with drums at the ripe old age of 8 and has been playing on and off since then, but more consistently over the past 8 years. His musical influences are diverse and he tries to incorporate many genres into his playing. With a background in Metal and Punk, Lou has expanded his skills to show a softer side in joining Ghost Cat Attack. 

This is our passion, our purpose, and lifelong dream.  I have an amazing band who are ready to follow me around the country playing my songs and helping me reach my goals.  It would mean everything if you could help make this dream a reality.  I believe you can.  
   What We Need & What You Get

We are asking for $10,000 to cover 2-3 weeks of studio time, mixing, mastering, reproduction, distribution, PR, promotion, and tour support to get us on the road promoting this album and playing our hearts out for you.  This is what we want to be doing for a living, full time.  But we need the tools to build this business.  With your help, I know we can make this EP a huge success.
We have so many amazing perks for you from an advanced download of our first single for as little as a $5 contribution -to having us travel anywhere in the United States to play a private party for you and your friends and a whole lot of cool stuff in between.  I feel that the local music community here in Arizona has been huge in helping our band find it's groove and so we would like to give some perks with them in mind.  Such as:

 One lucky donor will take home a painting of a Ghost Cat Attack painted by the very talented singer/songwriter/artist extraordinaire Hannah Bones (previously of Doctor Bones).  

2 signed guitars, one of which was signed by Ghost Cat Attack (BIG THANKS TO BIZARRE GUITAR for the hookup!) and one of which has been autographed by all of the amazing artists who played our fundraiser show:  The Banter, Dirty Sunset, Ben Anderson, Carol Pacey & the Honey Shakers, Ghost Cat Attack, Japhy's Descent, Woodworks, Jeanne & the Beat, Hannah Bones, Manny Tripodis, Ronnie Winters, & Jess Pruitt.  This is a collectors item for any die-hard music fan. 

Several gift cards to local music venues, such as: Rogue Bar, Pho Cao, Terroir Wine Pub, Twisted Lizard and Stinkweeds record store.
2 hours of practice time at Bomb Shelter Rehearsal Studio where GCA practices
2 lessons with our guitar player Emmanuel Aube
A chance to be in the music video for our firs single. 

With even half of our goal met ($5,000) we will still be able to get the songs recorded and released digitally, it will just take more time to get the songs out there to the fans.  We'll release the EP digitally on Bandcamp, Amazon, I-tunes & Spotify, etc... to fund the reproduction of physical CDs, and eventually a tour to support the EP beyond our local market.  We will continue with our grassroots approach, returning to the local radio stations and other social media outlets, and most of all word of mouth to promote this music.  Either way, we will have a quality product worth putting out there, even if we don't have the help of a publicist, PR firm or distribution company.
   The Impact


I believe that music from the heart, feeds the heart.  This music is from my heart to yours.  It has come from growing up in Arizona, surrounded by the beauty of the desert & the madness of the music scene.  It has been inspired by the search for love, meaning and belonging.  I hope that it will bring you joy, or comfort, or perhaps just simply a release.
In preparation to launch this campaign, we put on a very successful fundraiser show with 8 other bands volunteering their services and raised over $400 towards this project in just one night!  This is a music community that believes in us and is ready to see us take the next step.  I hope you will join them in that belief and contribute to this album.
All 4 members of Ghost Cat Attack take this project very seriously and are ready to make it our full time job.  We see this campaign as a way to raise seed money for the business that is our band.  This investment, will allow us to create our product and give us the capital we need to get it off the ground. 
   Risks & Challenges
This is our first time recording a project of this caliber and from recording to actually getting a finished product out, there are many things I am sure I will have to learn along the way.  But luckily I have the support of an amazing music community whose counsel and opinions I trust.  The night of our fundraiser show, we had a technical glitch in the first few minutes- and I realized I was blessed to have 3 different people I could call at the drop of a hat who could and would help just for that one sound issue. 
A wise man once said, ""A rising tide lifts all boats"" and I firmly believe that.  It is in our best interest to see this music community thrive, because it raises the bar.  Our success is your success and together we are all uplifted.  I have faith in the resources we have to draw on, in the wisdom of our friends that have gone before us, at this very exciting time in the Arizona music scene.  This album is going to ROCK!

<h3>WHO I AM</h3>
<p>My name is Jonas Woods.  I'm a full time touring Christian recording artist, producer, worship team development consultant, worship leader, and speaker.  I tour full time coast to coast and overseas with my amazing wife Becky and two boys Hunter (9) and Liam (6).  Becky sings with me and speaks on occasion.  I've been in the music industry now for almost 15 years.  It's been a crazy journey so far with plenty of mountains and valleys along the way.  My last record ""TALES OF THE BITTERSWEET"" chronicled some of our struggles and victories that my wife Becky and I endured during the writing and recording of that album.  Becky's diagnosis with stage 4 cancer made every part of that album special.  I've never been so pleased with what was achieved through that creative time. Utilizing my friends Paul Colman, Jeremy Michael, AJ Sanchez, Claas Jambor, Jonathan Thatcher, and Lisa McKenzie we were able to put out something that I am extremely proud of.  </p>
<p>Now it's time to do it again! I'm honored that so many have found solace and comfort in my lyrics.  It truly makes what I do worth it.  We are in this to instill hope, to show love, and to demonstrate through our lives, the amazing Love of Jesus. </p>
<p><b>THE NEXT BIG STEP</b></p>
<p>Becky and I discovered over the last few years that our mission, if you will, is unique in that we don't feel the pressure to be on the radio, on the tv, or in print.  With that being said we're working towards those goals as they are a part of the industry that we work in.  However, having the freedom to share from our hearts, to create uniquely designed concerts and worship services, and being able to speak and perform at various events keeps us busy.  As hard as it has been for us to grasp, we've felt now for a few years that we were being propelled into a sort of, musical mission.  We've all but refrained from calling ourselves musical missionaries.  Yes, we perform covers like ""FIRE and RAIN"" by James Taylor and play the blues, and sing love songs but our ultimate goal is to leave people with a better understanding of who they are as a child of the Creator!  Super exciting stuff.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>THIS IS WHAT IT'S FOR</b></p>
<p>THE WRITING PROCESS AND RECORDING OF THE NEXT JONAS WOODS FULL ALBUM WITH ALL IT'S BELLS AND WHISTLES.  </p>
</div><div>
<h3>WHAT THE FUNDS ARE FOR MORE SPECIFICALLY</h3>
<p>HERE'S WHAT THE MONEY IS GOING TO BE USED FOR:</p>
<ul>
<li>2 TO 3 WEEKS OF WRITING WITH PROFESSIONAL WRITERS IN NASHVILLE</li>
<li>RECORDING DEMOS WITH OLD BEAR STUDIOS AND THE TEAM </li>

<li>PAYING THE STUDIO MUSICIANS</li>
<li>THE CHOIR</li>

<div> </div>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Those of you who know Becky and myself will note that we're not in this to impress but rather to instill hope, to show love the best way we know how; through our music.  I want people to have a voice that shares in their joys, their pain, and their victories!  We desire more then anything to be used.  Plain and simple. </p>

</div><p> </p></div>","'The Wobble' video fund was so  successful,  we landed an agent - Muttis Booking! Thank you! Now we need to press a 
7"" Vinyl Record: 

A side: Iggy Pop's 'Lust For Life'// B side: 'The Wobble' & shoot a video for 'Lust For Life'.

 
I am Saudia Young, a singer from  New York City, based in Berlin Germany. My four piece band and I been playing in Berlin for a couple of years. The sound? Think Big Mamma Thornton, Nick Curran & Bo Diddley. We call it Noir Rockabilly Blues!

This campaign is to fund the studio production of  'Lust For Life' by Iggy Pop, the pressing of a 7"" VINYL RECORD & a Video for Lust For Life.

The last campaign had a powerful  impact on our trajectory as a working band. Muttis Booking,  will submit us to festivals throughout Europe. We have already been booked at the prestigious Sjock Festival in Belgium, July 8th 2017.


What Our booking agent absolutely 'must have' is a Vinyl Record to do his job for us.  The Vinyl Record will enable us to get RADIO & DJ play & BOOKINGS . The discs will also be sold on the road, to our lovely fans. The VINYL& VIDEO will help BOOST our profile and will give people another taste of what we bring!

 

What We Need & What You Get

We need the funding for the : Song Studio Production & Post Production, Vinyl Production & Video Production.
What you get: Vinyl Records, T-shirts, Shopping Bags, Mp3 Downloads, & MORE, plus the knowledge that you are helping us to keep on rocking it, in the free world!

The studio recording has been paid out of pocket, so if we do not reach the final goal, it would be great to cover that. So every bit counts.

Lust for Life:Writer-Iggy PopProducer: Lars VegasVocals: Saudia YoungGuitars, upright bass, piano & backing vocals: Lars VegasDrums-& percussion: Tomas Svensson

FYI: 5% of funding raised will go for  Indiegogo admin fees & 5% will go to:Sacred Stone Camp//Standing Rock Pipeline Protest Camp's Official fund: https://www.gofundme.com/sacredstonecamp   which will go toward purchasing water, food, propane, blankets and other supplies. Checks, cash or supplies (http://sacredstonecamp.org/supply-list/) can also be sent through the mail to:Sacred Stone Camp, P.O. Box 1011, Fort Yates, ND 58538



The Impact

You are supporting DIY-self made artists, in a time when good music & art, by the people, for the people, is needed more than ever!
We successfully completed three funding campaigns, most notably 'The Wobble' Single & Video.
Without you we are nothing! 
WE LOVE YOU!

To fill in the holes I'd like to introduce myself and give you all some background that you may or may not already know. My pseudonym is Jackson Cavalier, I took on this name a few years ago when I decided to begin my pursuit to become a full time musician. I've been playing music since I was a kid and began playing out at bars and concert halls when I was in high school. After a short stint at college I realized I just couldn't wait any longer to pursue my ambitions of making a living doing what I love to do most, playing music.</p><p>My journey began as a busker (street performer) on the streets and farmers markets of Rochester, NY back in 2013.  My act evolved into a one man band folkrock/americana showcase which got the attention of what were to me, shockingly large crowds of passer-bys. That pursuit quickly evolved into all sorts of gigs around upstate NY at bars, private events, concert halls, festivals, and a status as the house musician/music booker at The Daily Refresher.</p><p>Now on to why I decided to create this campaign. With this amount of gigging I have been able to make enough to live a modest and happy life, but the one thing I have found I cannot afford to do is find room in my budget to spend on recording my material. Recording a full length album is extremely expensive and it would take years for me to save up enough money to do so if it were entirely on my own. My main goals with this campaign are to create an album reminiscent of the early works of artists like Bob Dylan, where you feel as though you are right there in the room with the artist as they present their songs to you. Much of my new solo material is folk-centric americana, and I want to give you that same experience. Each track will be just as if I were playing it to you live: One voice, one guitar, one suitcase drum kit, one harmonica, and one performance. My second goal in this campaign is to create an album that will further my career as a musician and help get me signed to a label. Being signed to a label would help me immensely to get my music out to those who have never heard it, and to be able to tour across the country getting exposure to all sorts of new crowds. If you are one of the amazingly kind people that have ever told me I'm going to make it big one day, I really think this would be my best bet. This has always been a dream of mine and I believe that the songs on this album will help that dream come true upon completion.</p><p> </p><h3>What You Will Be Funding, &amp; What You Will Get In Return</h3><p>As many would want to know, myself included, the following is a list of expenses that your donation will help fund,</p><ul>
<li>$2700- Will go to the processes of recording, engineering, mixing, and mastering of the 10 tracks on the album.</li>
<li>$500- Will go to the physical production of this album, which includes, CD's, Cases, Cover Art Expenses, all in all the first pressing should be about 300 copies.</li>
<li>$300- Will help cover the tax 3-5% collected by indiegogo and other payment sources, as well as costs of promoting the album.</li>
</ul><p>All said and done the campaign goal adds up to $3500.00 which with your help I think can be achieved. If the goal is not met Indiegogo will still allow me to keep the funding I have raised. If the goal is not met my plan is to continue on with this project in a scaled down version, scaling back to fit the amount of money raised. While this is not ideal I still want to be able to supply donors with new material.</p><h3>Perks!</h3><p>As with any other indiegogo campaign this one will include Perks for donors! The full list of Perks can be found on the campaign page but will include a copy of the finished album, a song written for you by me, a private show by yours truly, etc.</p><h3>Can't Donate? You Can Still Help!</h3><p>If you'd like to donate but don't have the means you can still help. Spread the word about this campaign and what I'm trying to achieve, share the address to this page on social media, tell your friends and family! Any help getting exposure for this campaign is appreciated!</p></div>","This Campaign, My Music, & My FutureSo many of you who happen upon this campaign may know me very well, or might not know me at all.

Fast forward...as Joe decided to leave Nashville for New York City to spread his musical wings, I jumped at the chance to work with him again and to make this Holiday record together.  I often imagine what it was like growing up in the 1930's and 1940's when the Great American Songbook was the music in the ears of the world around us.  The artists from my grandparents' generation have been my own musical inspiration, and where I feel most “at home”.    Christmas and the Holidays are filled with magic and miracles, and this has always been such an inspirational time of year for me.  I wanted to bundle up all of that love and channel it into the music that you will hear on this album.  It's music of hope, joy, laughter, love, loss, dreams, prayers, friendship and family.  The instrumentalists and vocalists whom I have asked to join me on this record are not only talented performers, but also people whom I am so blessed to call family.  The recording and production costs for this album are high, and I would not be able to do this without the help of my friends, family, and wonderful folks like you!  Your financial support will help us finish recording in the studio, to mix and master, finalize album artwork, license the tunes, and press CD's, as well as create digital downloads, just in time for you to get your copies...AND just in time for the Holidays!!!  ****************AND NOW . . . Joe Davidian! Joe was born in 1981 in rural Vermont and showed musical promise from a very early age. He started taking classical piano lessons at the age of six and became interested in jazz shortly thereafter. He studied jazz piano with professionals Kenny Werner and Jim McNeely throughout his high school years.In 2003, Joe received his Bachelor of Music in Jazz Piano Performance from the University of Miami, and from 2003-2005, while working on his Master’s degree, he served as Teaching Assistant in the University of Miami Jazz Piano department. After graduation, Joe was hired to teach jazz courses at the University of Vermont during the 2006-2007 academic year.From 2007 until 2016, Joe lived in Nashville, Tennessee, where he taught jazz piano and directed ensembles at Belmont University and Middle Tennessee State University. He also taught various classes at the Nashville Jazz Workshop.Joe’s own group, The Joe Davidian Trio, has recorded four albums on the Sonic Mirage Media label: For the Birds (1999), JD3: Live (2003), Silent Fire (2008) and Live at the Jazz Cave: Volume One (2013).

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Danny Diaz has touched the lives of may key musicians in his 50 year career as a Guitarist, Songwriter &amp; Educator.  He is a talented guitarist who still performs and composes today.  His dream  is to record his first album of original music featuring some of his former students and peers.  The album will cover several bebop, blues  and swing compositions that he has written.  He is a 3 time survivor of cancer and lives on a very fixed income.   Word has spread quickly and donations of skills, tools, talent are coming in quickly thus reducing the original 11k  cost we budgeted.  We are now calling on family, friends and the public to support the costs for the remainder of the project at $3800 (for artwork, reproduction, studio, mixing, mastering, licensing, publishing set up, etc. ) </p>

<h3>Hello!</h3>
<p>I'm Alex Van Gils, a composer living and working in the SF Bay Area. You may know me from Oakland-based political theatre ensemble The Bonfire Makers, or from work I've done recently with the Awesöme Orchestra Collective or the Friction Quartet. </p>
<p>I love synthesizers and computer music, and I use both in my music for theatre, but I've never released an album-length composition of electronic music before. This campaign is here to change that, and give you, my supporters and audience, the ability to take my music home with you for the first time. No longer will you have to wait until the next concert or theatre performance to hear my sounds!</p>
<p><font>Usually, when I write a piece, the process is kept between me and the performers. This time, I want to try something different. In this case, I am both the composer and the performer—so I want to bring you, my supporters, into the process, through several of the perks available on this campaign.</font></p>
</div><div>
<p>Here's why I'm raising <strong>money</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>The majority of the funds I'm raising will go towards equipment costs for this project, specifically, a beautiful synthesizer called the Prophet-T8. From the first moment I heard this instrument, I had to compose music for it. In addition to an incredible sound, this instrument also has wonderful weighted keys and a host of features that open my mind every time I visit it in the synthesizer shop. The music that I'm planning for this composition is inspired in particular by this special instrument, and this accounts for about $5,000 of the campaign.</li>
<li>Roughly $1,000 of the campaign will go towards the design and release of this album. I'm raising funds to pay my artist and designer friends to work on the visual aspects of the album. There will also be costs to create physical copies of the album.</li>
<li>The remainder of the funds raised (roughly $700) will go towards a website to host and represent this work, and cover the Indiegogo fees.</li>
</ul>
<p>Scroll down on this page and you'll see that this campaign has <strong>perks</strong> that are designed to give you a window into the creation of this music, either through:</p>
<ul>
<li>early releases of draft sounds and sketches,</li>
<li>a behind-the-scenes walkthrough of my work,</li>
<li>a special listening party held in your home (or in another location in the SF Bay Area).</li>
</ul>
<p>If this campaign does not reach the total of $6,700, I'll still complete some kind of electronic composition for synthesizers, though I may need to do it in a different way, perhaps with a different kind of release or with a different instrument</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you can't contribute to this campaign right now, but still want to help, OR if you've contributed but you are wanting to do more, please:</p>

<p><strong>WHAT’S MY STORY?</strong></p>
<p>I’m Leigh Taylor, a singer/songwriter, voiceover artist, worship leader, husband and father.  I’ve been working on some new songs for quite a while now and a few years ago, I figured it was time to head into the studio.</p>
<p>But in late 2014, I was diagnosed with an aggressive form of prostate cancer.  However, one surgery and 39 radiation treatments later, I am finally ready to get back to work on this project.  In fact, I can’t wait.  I’ve been practicing these new songs with several musicians, but the two main guys are Ray “Piki” Moreno and John Simons. I can tell you it’s been a lot of fun and I’m looking forward to pushing that record button. </p>
<p>With an independent project like this, you have the creative freedom. Now, I’m trying to put together a unique album of Christian based originals, which I hope will appeal to a wide audience. However, there is a huge financial burden that comes with creative freedom, especially since a lot of people don't 'buy' albums anymore.</p>
<p><strong>SO WHAT DO I NEED?</strong></p>
<p>I need to raise about $38,500 to fund this CD project. This would go towards things like recording, mixing, mastering, paying musicians and studio engineers, artwork, printing costs, CD production, promotional material and the whole idea of trying to get this project to a wider audience. </p>
<p>That's right, it's not cheap to make and market a recording for all the reasons listed above, and more, but that’s what it takes to put out something of quality. Something I can be proud of. Something I think you’ll love.</p>
<p><strong>WHAT DO YOU GET?</strong></p>
<p>You get to be a part of the production team by helping to fund this project. And you get to choose from a variety of perks depending on your level of participation. CDs, hats, shirts, bit-o-honey, house concerts, etc.</p>
<p><strong>SPREAD THE WORD!</strong></p>
<p>Please help spread the word to all your friends and family.  You can easily share this campaign by using the buttons on the Indiegogo site, which will help you spread the word via Facebook, etc.  You can also share by e-mail or even word of mouth!  The more that get involved, the quicker it will be to bring this project to completion.  </p>

<h2>The Skinny</h2>
<p>Tall Walls is a six-piece band formed shortly before Summer And Music's Buskerfest 2015 competition (Long Beach, CA) a little over a year ago. Well, we won, and we've been performing and recording ever since. Our new CD documents this time. The recording  was paid for with our Buskerfest winnings.  Those winnings, however, didn't cover everything, so we came out of our own pockets to get our debut out in the world. Obviously we're hoping to recoup our costs through album sales.</p>
<p>Mostly, though, we just want to share what we've done. This campaign was created as a way to share our story and project with you -- friends, families, and fans old and new. You contribute simply by buying the CD (comes with a digital download). We'll mail it to you free of charge.</p>
<p>Want a sample before you lay your good money down? Fair enough. Here's <a href=""https://soundcloud.com/tallwalls/government-boy"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">""Government Boy""</a> (which has turned out to be a bit more topical than we'd hoped).</p>
<p>If you have a little extra cash to spend, we'll bring our entire album-release-show set to you -- your backyard, your living room, wherever you say (within Los Angeles and Orange Counties, anyway). </p>

<h3>Who is May Hemmer?</h3>
<p>May is known as ""The Sassiest Thing in New Orleans"" and has been dubbed the ""Cocoa Barbie"" by Vita DeVoid of Florida. This lady has a larger than life personality and has been gracing the stages with nerdlesque, neo burlesque, and much more since 2011.  A member of the Storyville Starlettes and The Bluestockings, she performs regularly at Burlesque Ballroom,Big Deal Burlesque, and many more independent shows and private events around NOLA.   </p>
<p>With that said, May has started her own production by the name of Haus of MayHem that has traveled to Jackson, MS and will soon have a base in New Orleans. She has also begun a monthly production called Bohemian Burlesque at United Bakery Gallery which is the last Thursday of every month in NOLA.  </p>

<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>What I am looking for is a start to get my swag and merchandise off off the ground.  I have finally reached a part of my career where I want to provide fans with personalized items that they can have.  But why?  The funds I had saved to go towards these items now have to go to replacing damaged costumes due to a break in.</p>
<p>But what will you get in return?  Anything from personal thank you to a ticket to the next show I am in.  I want to be able to thank those who support me and help me grow as a performer as well as a business woman.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>I am wanting to help spread the awareness of more performers of color (POC) around the country and eventually the world.  I am also aiming to play my part in the POC pin up community.</p>

</div></div>","Who is May Hemmer?
May is known as ""The Sassiest Thing in New Orleans"" and has been dubbed the ""Cocoa Barbie"" by Vita DeVoid of Florida. This lady has a larger than life personality and has been gracing the stages with nerdlesque, neo burlesque, and much more since 2011.  A member of the Storyville Starlettes and The Bluestockings, she performs regularly at Burlesque Ballroom,Big Deal Burlesque, and many more independent shows and private events around NOLA.   
With that said, May has started her own production by the name of Haus of MayHem that has traveled to Jackson, MS and will soon have a base in New Orleans. She has also begun a monthly production called Bohemian Burlesque at United Bakery Gallery which is the last Thursday of every month in NOLA.  
Her solo debut has included performances at the Southern Fried Burlesque Festival, Arizona Burlesque Festival, Great Southern Exposure, and many other productions for the troupe BurlEscapades in Phoenix, AZ.  She was recognized in 2015, as the Master of Tassels in the Louisiana Regional Burlypicks and is both the 2016 Shimmy Showdown Siobhan Atomica Brown Noser and Jeez Loueez Boo Bitch Bye award winner.

What I Need & What You Get
What I am looking for is a start to get my swag and merchandise off off the ground.  I have finally reached a part of my career where I want to provide fans with personalized items that they can have.  But why?  The funds I had saved to go towards these items now have to go to replacing damaged costumes due to a break in.
But what will you get in return?  Anything from personal thank you to a ticket to the next show I am in.  I want to be able to thank those who support me and help me grow as a performer as well as a business woman.

The Impact
I am wanting to help spread the awareness of more performers of color (POC) around the country and eventually the world.  I am also aiming to play my part in the POC pin up community.

<h3><u>KRISTS SARŽANTS</u></h3>
<p>is a Latvian composer who takes his inspiration from classical, jazz and film music. Studied classical and jazz piano and composition with Raimonds Petrauskis, Andris Dzenītis, Søren Møller and the others, in 2018 Krists was nominated for the Nic Gotham Award for the contribution to jazz music and jazz life in Latvia. In his music Krists uses modern classical music techniques, jazz improvisation, polyphonic melodies and film music inspired harmonies, with his recordings distributed worldwide at the largest European jazz gathering “Jazzahead! 2017” and included in the official “Jazz in Latvia 2018” CD compilation.</p>

<p style=""text-align: right;"">""THEN AND NOW"" is an album project Krists has been working on for quite some time. It is a compilation of Krists' best compositions in new arrangements and instrumentations for a specially gathered line-up of his friends, colleagues and some renowned musicians from Latvia and Denmark – Evilena Protektore, Sonora Vaice, Ieva Kerēvica, Dāvis Jurka, Matias Fischer-Mogensen to name a few, all of them have agreed to participate in this project and create something unforgettable this July. In addition to the CD we're offering a small album-sized book with never before released stories about each composition, translations, lyrics, info about the musicians, pictures and much more to dig in while listening to the album.</p>

<p>For as long as I can remember, I have enjoyed telling and hearing stories. I honestly believe that the most powerful stories we can tell are the ones which speak truthfully of the struggles and triumphs we have faced. If we are willing to make ourselves vulnerable, we can connect with others in their pain and also celebrate with them in their victories.</p>
<p>Having spent 3 or 4 years coming up with words and melodies in my quiet time, in the summer of 2015 I taught myself some chords and instantly felt a release and a certainty that this was what I should be pursuing. Every time I have completed a song, God has given me a clear word to share it with a specific person and I now believe that He is telling me to go further and make them available to everyone. At the beginning of 2016 I launched a Kickstarter campaign to record an EP and although it raised almost £800, it was ultimately 'unsuccessful' and therefore I didn't receive the money. I believed at the time that the only way I could make a product I would be happy with was to raise the full amount but I have since realised that that was probably pride (and a little fear) talking and I am now excited to see what this campaign will bring.</p>
<p>I would be lying if I said I wasn't nervous about this project but more than anything I am so excited to share these songs that have been on my heart for so long. My desire is that these songs would bring peace to those who hear them.</p>
<p>As of now I am working with a small group of musicians and friends to pull together arrangements for the songs and finalise the details of how this EP will sound. Once all the funds are raised, the next stage will be to begin rehearsing with the musicians and finally hold a live event to finalise the EP recording.</p>
<p>The money raised will go towards paying musicians expenses, sound production costs/equipment and costs of designing and producing hard copies of the EP (including cover art and producing CDs).</p>
<p>Thank you all so much for your support up to this point and thank you in advance for your donations! I'm excited to make this EP with you!</p>

She is super excited to see this project come to life while empowering women! Amanda Ready is the founder and CEO of Ready to Empower. She met a community of women in Costa Rica who she found to be jobless, uneducated, without adequate health care, living in poverty, and victims of abuse with no long-term support. Having experience working in social services and the mental health field, Amanda began offering mental health therapy to women to gain insight into their emotional challenges. After many sessions with the women, Amanda learned that not only mental health support was needed but also food, clothing, healthcare, education and employment opportunities.Shout out to the amazing music production team; Serafin El Revolucionario and Bryan Spitzer.Thank you to Jon Delice for filming our campaign video, please follow him on instagram @jdelice.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>My Next Solo Album</p>
<p>Hello friends! I'm Samantha Pearl - singer, songwriter, actress and painter. What I love most is connecting with people through my music and art. Evoking a range of emotions from creative endeavors has become my passion. I love to captivate an audience with the sole purpose of leading them on an emotional adventure through the music I create and the painting that I have made over my lifetime. I'm here to share some beautiful songs I have written oven the past year through my travels in Europe. I'm here to make music and art that helps people heal. My hope in creating this studio album with my friend Raymond Richards in Portland is to capture a special moment of transformation and transition. I have spent much time touring overseas in Europe over the past 3 years doing solo performances and performing with other musicians back in New Orleans. During Covid I have been working on growing and I would like to focus more during this time to stay as productive as possible. It's a bit scary, but mostly exciting. These are songs I've been waiting to share for some time now and with your help I can record them in a way that captures the true heart and soul of each one. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>For me and For You</h3>
<p>  I had planned on making this album without financial support. I was proud to be working to reinvest in myself, but sometimes we have to take a step back and ask for help. After the unfortunate outbreak of Covid-19 the majority of my shows and tours were cancelled and moving forward with the album was no longer an option. A friend suggested I reach out to my beautiful fans and community and here we are! </p>
<p>So here's the financial breakdown</p>
<p>$1000 to finish the album </p>
<p>$ 500 for Music Video costs</p>
<p><span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">$500 for mixing and mastering</span></p>
<p>$2000 for pressing CDs and Vinyl</p>
<p>$1500 for other Merch (T-shirts, Stickers, etc...) </p>
<p>What I'm most excited about are the perks! They will span $10-$1,000 and there is something for everyone! Vinyl, T-Shirts, signed merch, original paintings, hand-written lyrics, song writing sessions, an intimate over-night listening party, and even a private house concert, and more.</p>
<p>I am so excited to finally bring these songs to life and share them with you! </p>
<p>Other Ways You Can Help</p>
<p>I know during this difficult time some people will not be able to contribute. By sharing my campaign you are helping spread the word and that is a contribution all its own! Listening to my music on streaming platforms like Spotify is another great way to help! </p>

<h3>The Journey Begins.</h3>
<ul>
<li>SpinKicK was formed by me in October 2015, with a focus on sharing music that the audience can enjoy and relate too. We spin our melodies, and kick it into the hearts of our fans. We combine, Jazz, Funk, Hip Hop, and Dance music to provide a kaleidoscope of sound that will make you move and groove.</li>
<li>This campaign is to bring our music from our live shows into your home. When I wrote the music for our album I was inspired by bands such as Earth Wind and Fire, Brand New Heavies, Prince, and Jamiroquai. Thanks to the artistic talent of Karen Marie on vocals, Sean Richey on Guitar, Andrew Freeman on Keys, and Alex Busby Smith on Bass, SpinKicK's music is artistic, deep, and universal. </li>
<li>I have been sitting on this music for over 10 years. I always had a vision for my own group, but it never materialized. Other bands, other engagements, and then Tendonitis took me away from my passion to play music for 2 years. Through my family and friends I was able to pull from the darkness and form this group of amazing artists. Your help today will give us the chance to release our voice to the world, share the spirit of excitement, and bring a groove hotter than fire for years to come.</li>
</ul>
<p>We have started the recording process, but we need our fans to get us to the finish line.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need From You &amp; What You Get Back</h3>
<ul>
<li>We are ready to give this great music to you, but we need your help to make it a reality. We need to raise $9,000 to achieve our goal. This is for the mixing, the making of CDs, touring, the artists and more. </li>
<li>We have different perks to go with your donation. Donate what you can, we greatly appreciate it! The higher your donation, the bigger your perk. Perks include digital downloads of the album, SpinKicK merchandise, and VIP privileges just to name a few. </li>
<li>If we are not able to reach our goal by the deadline, we will go forward with the donations we received. It will be harder though, and we hope we can work together to make this dream real.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact of Your Donation</h3>
<ul>
<li>The impact you would be making by donating would be huge. There are many bands out there, but none exist like SpinKicK. The melodies will move you, the rhythms will groove you and the harmonies will soothe you. </li>
<li>We have performed all over NYC, but with enough donations from our fans we can tour and promote all over the country. The endgame goal will be to perform around the world!</li>
<li>We have the power to bring the vibes and the spirit, you have to power to bring this album to life. </li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Risks &amp; Challenges of Making an Album</h3>
<ul>
<li>The challenges have been financially draining. It costs nothing to dream, but costs everything to bring it to the forefront.  I was born in Queens NY to a hardworking Middle Class family. I have student loans that take a chunk of my account, and has always made me self conscience about recording an album. </li>
<li>However, I work hard, perform, promote, book, teach and do what I can to fulfill my dreams. Now, I need help because me and my band cannot do it alone.</li>

<h3>My Story</h3>
<p>My name is Kruttika Sequeira. I grew up in Mumbai, India. My story isn't like most artists who always knew they wanted to be a musician and had been playing since they were three. I had vague ideas about what I wanted to do. I thought I would be someone important and make a more direct difference in people's lives, like be a doctor, or join the armed forces, but after I lost partial eyesight when I was 13 and become permanently disabled, everything changed. All those dreams I had were shattered. How could I save lives when I could barely hang on to my own. What was someone in my state to do? I couldn't even travel on my own. It took me years to train myself how to navigate the world without assistance. I ended up in art school, since that seemed like something I didn't really need the best eyesight for. The experiences I had in those 4 years set me on the course to find a new dream. The creative world. Luckily I found I was actually good at it. I had anyway being learning the keyboard since 10, so I decided to do something in the arts field. I wrote my first song at 20 and for the first time I felt that I had found the truest form of expression. I never felt more myself than when I was singing or playing the piano. <strong>Music saved my life. </strong></p>
<h3>About ""Snow""</h3>
<p>    These six songs I'm releasing are among the first I ever wrote. I was in a dark place when I wrote these. I was in so much emotional pain that I desperately longed for something to numb it. My decision to record these songs and release them was my way to finally let go of the hurt and anger and start afresh. I no longer harbour the same dark emotions. A lot of therapy and meditation has helped me focus and reset. That's why this project is so close to my heart, it's the past, younger me that I am setting free, so I can begin a new story. And even though these songs were written by another version of myself, I always cherish them because it made me who I am today.</p>

My name is Kruttika Sequeira. I grew up in Mumbai, India. My story isn't like most artists who always knew they wanted to be a musician and had been playing since they were three. I had vague ideas about what I wanted to do. I thought I would be someone important and make a more direct difference in people's lives, like be a doctor, or join the armed forces, but after I lost partial eyesight when I was 13 and become permanently disabled, everything changed. All those dreams I had were shattered. How could I save lives when I could barely hang on to my own. What was someone in my state to do? I couldn't even travel on my own. It took me years to train myself how to navigate the world without assistance. I ended up in art school, since that seemed like something I didn't really need the best eyesight for.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>If you don't know me yet heres a little introduction. My name is Mikael Rochman aka Young Zion. I was born in Miami, moved around the world but never lost touch of where my true home is. Before I joined the IDF I was thinking of other ways I could play a role in bring my generation forward, defending Israel, and empowering Jewish and non Jewish Zionists. After a friend brought me to a studio to watch him record, I used the extra studio time to try it out myself and found a new passion and talent in making music. Music is one of the most important platforms of influence and for the most part the messages which are promoted today are very negative. I decided that I would make music that not only sounds great but will change the worlds perspective on Israel and Zionism. Since then, with little promotion my songs have accumulated over half a million streams. Imagine how many ears my message can reach with more funds to promote it.</p>
<p>I recently finished my 2 year service as a Paratrooper in the Israeli Defense Force and I am now focused on my music and making an Album. I want each and every song on this project to make an impact which is why I need your help. During my army service I was able to save up money which most soldiers use for their post-army trip, however because this album and the change it can bring is so important to me I decided that I would use my army savings to fund my music as much as possible.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>My Costs</h3>
<p>As an independent artist I have many costs to pay including production, engineering (mixing and mastering) and once the album is finished, promotion. On average the price to fully complete one song without promotion is 600$ after engineering and production. Since I finished the army I have recorded about 22 songs and I am still going, however, I will pick the best 13-15 tracks to include on the album which without promotion comes out to about 9000$. The next, most important step is promotion which is to get people to actually listen to my work. This will cost another few thousand dollars based on which ways I choose to promote the album.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>My music touches on a range of subjects including Civil Rights, Racism, Anti-semitism/Zionism, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and more. I want to empower Jews around the world to fight for their rights and promote a message of peace with our neighbors so that my generation can find a way forward. Just Imagine the positive impact my album could have on pop culture and bringing change in the future.</p>
</div><div><h3>Why I Need Your Help</h3></div><p>As a recently released lone soldier and independent artist I just don't have the funds yet to be able to finish and release this project which is why I need the help of every Zionist who wants to see change in the way the media and pop culture treats Israel and empower other Zionists to stand up in their own way. I truly believe that my music can achieve all of these goals and all I ask is for you to put some faith in me and join the movement.</p><p>Lets end Anti-Semitism/Zionism, empower our people, and bring an end to the hate that has plagued our world for so long.</p></div>","Short Summary

<h3>Jai Aquarian</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Hi, I am Jai Aquarian Kydd. For the last 16 years I have mostly lived in East Vancouver, BC, where I've been deeply involved in community building, event organizing and co-creating. I have been studying and facilitating movement and voice workshops for almost 20 years. I also write songs. A lot of songs and prompt poems (taking words from friends and strangers and producing work inspired on dance floors and at events that I feel are making a new paradigm and crafting a new culture).</p>
<p>I often joke that the new paradigm is called #sexyweird. It's like the old paradigm, with a lot more equality and consent, and a little more tongue. The catchy, trappy, festival bass song Kitties embodies exactly what the #sexyweird paradigm is all about. The vision for the video came that first night the words poured onto paper at Blessed Coast 2016.  It features professional dancers who have learned the first original choreography I've taught to others and a lot of community contributed content, DIY craftiness and perks I am excited to share with my friends family and the growing Kitten Army.</p>
<p>Launching this campaign will help complete the video I have been seeding and nurturing for almost two years. It will also facilitate a  re-mix the vocals that has evolved through several live performances of Kitties, The vision allows the community to contribute a lip-synced verse, submit a 5 second video of actual kittens (especially acting out the lyrics of the song) to be considered for the final edit and invite the #sexyweird to come to fruition.</p>
<p>Aside from the CROWDSOURCED aspects of this video the CROWDFUNDING will help Jai Aquarian pay the dancers and the Videography team (Fractal Five Productions), pay for transportation, video editing and post-production effects, and update his website and create an advertising campaign for the Video launch to take the viral video potential of this song to greater audience.</p>
<p>The perks for supporting this project will help book shows and workshop appearances in advance of Jai's Canadian tour, June 15-August 3rd, as well as releasing Jai Aquarian's first merchandise offerings (Kitties tights, handmade crystal tipped unicorn horns, Kitty ears by local artisans including Jai Aquarian) and help finally publish a 66 page retrospective of Jai Aquarian's original songs, postcard and prompt poems (release date August 11th, 2019).</p>
<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<p>We are paying dancers for their time to learn this choreography-- 6 dancers @$200 each $1200</p>
<p>We need two make-up artists to do make-up for the dancers for the video, as well as the lip sync sessions $600</p>
<p>Transportation and catering for the video shoots $300</p>
<p>Website hosting and updates for jaiaquarian.com $400</p>
<p>Editing (hiring a mentor to work with Fractal Five productions to keep costs down) $450</p>
<p>Video Launch advertising campaign $250</p>
<p>Videography services for Fractal Five Productions $600</p>
<p>Location costs Rental of a studio to shoot the choreography in $350</p>
<p>Re-recording studio vocals for the Video release $120 (4 hours @ 30/hr)</p>
<p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Total Campaign budget=$4270</p>
<p>The unique perks to this campaign include Canned Unicorn Horns handmade by Jai Aquarian, Kitten ears  used in the filming of the video (also handmade by Jai Aquarian and other talented local crafters), a 66 page 8x12 copy of Jai Aquarian's Postcard Poems and Song Seeds book (coming in August 2019). #Sexyweird merch offerings also include special Kitties tights featuring the lyrics of the songs and the famous third eye Kitten by Phresha Le Vandale (used with permission of the artist), #sexyweird tanks, underwear and halters, the 7 song Shake Yr Sunshine EP (Jai Aquarian's first proper studio release featuring over a a dozen guest vocalists and musicians) in digital or cd form (with lyric sheet in the cd format).</p>
<p>Also on offer, pre-book Jai Aquarian to share a house concert, or live appearance on his Canadian tour mid June to early August, his VoiceBodyLove vocal playshop (suitable for adults or kids) or his brand new full-day offering Empowered Vocal Energetics.  Empowered Vocal Energetics will also be offered as a monthly 10-15 minute video series. It showcases Jai's unique vocal training resources for achieving a more embodied accessto your full, authentic expression.</p>
<p>Should we not achieve the full funding compliment in this campaign, the obvious cuts to expenses will be in scaled down advertising and web-site updating budgets as well as more in-house editing (the hiring of a mentor would speed up the process of our Videographer, Marquie Murphy of Fractal Five Productions) completing the video and help her develop her skill sets in exchange for a lot of donated time and dedication to this project,</p>
<p>Lastly, I paid to make an EP that showcased the wide range of songwriting styles I work with, re-recording the vocals prior to the video release reflects my desire to show how the few live performances of this song have evolved it from the original EP version. Though if i don't meet my target budget I would cover that expense myself. Check out the EP version at <a href=""https://soundcloud.com/jaiaquarian/kitties-1"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://soundcloud.com/jaiaquarian/kitties-1</a> and please feel free to like and comment on Soundcloud.</p>
<p>Also, if you want to skip this whole crowdfunding hoopla, you can purchase a physical copy of the album at cdbaby,com through this link: <a href=""https://hearnow.com/settings/2falb01250971#nt_settings"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://hearnow.com/settings/2falb01250971#nt</a></p>
<p>Or a digital copy of the EP at jaiquarian.bandcamp.com</p>
<p>The bonus of that route, is we get access to those funds immediately, not when the campaign is over.</p>

<p>I have never released a Crowdfunding campaign before and I am nervous about that. I have made most of my art for the sake of art and how it feels to create and share.

</div></div>","Jai Aquarian
 
Hi, I am Jai Aquarian Kydd. For the last 16 years I have mostly lived in East Vancouver, BC, where I've been deeply involved in community building, event organizing and co-creating. I have been studying and facilitating movement and voice workshops for almost 20 years. I also write songs. A lot of songs and prompt poems (taking words from friends and strangers and producing work inspired on dance floors and at events that I feel are making a new paradigm and crafting a new culture).
I often joke that the new paradigm is called #sexyweird. It's like the old paradigm, with a lot more equality and consent, and a little more tongue. The catchy, trappy, festival bass song Kitties embodies exactly what the #sexyweird paradigm is all about. The vision for the video came that first night the words poured onto paper at Blessed Coast 2016.  It features professional dancers who have learned the first original choreography I've taught to others and a lot of community contributed content, DIY craftiness and perks I am excited to share with my friends family and the growing Kitten Army.
Launching this campaign will help complete the video I have been seeding and nurturing for almost two years. It will also facilitate a  re-mix the vocals that has evolved through several live performances of Kitties, The vision allows the community to contribute a lip-synced verse, submit a 5 second video of actual kittens (especially acting out the lyrics of the song) to be considered for the final edit and invite the #sexyweird to come to fruition.
Aside from the CROWDSOURCED aspects of this video the CROWDFUNDING will help Jai Aquarian pay the dancers and the Videography team (Fractal Five Productions), pay for transportation, video editing and post-production effects, and update his website and create an advertising campaign for the Video launch to take the viral video potential of this song to greater audience.
The perks for supporting this project will help book shows and workshop appearances in advance of Jai's Canadian tour, June 15-August 3rd, as well as releasing Jai Aquarian's first merchandise offerings (Kitties tights, handmade crystal tipped unicorn horns, Kitty ears by local artisans including Jai Aquarian) and help finally publish a 66 page retrospective of Jai Aquarian's original songs, postcard and prompt poems (release date August 11th, 2019).
What We Need & What You Get
We are paying dancers for their time to learn this choreography-- 6 dancers @$200 each $1200
We need two make-up artists to do make-up for the dancers for the video, as well as the lip sync sessions $600
Transportation and catering for the video shoots $300
Website hosting and updates for jaiaquarian.com $400
Editing (hiring a mentor to work with Fractal Five productions to keep costs down) $450
Video Launch advertising campaign $250
Videography services for Fractal Five Productions $600
Location costs Rental of a studio to shoot the choreography in $350
Re-recording studio vocals for the Video release $120 (4 hours @ 30/hr)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Total Campaign budget=$4270
The unique perks to this campaign include Canned Unicorn Horns handmade by Jai Aquarian, Kitten ears  used in the filming of the video (also handmade by Jai Aquarian and other talented local crafters), a 66 page 8x12 copy of Jai Aquarian's Postcard Poems and Song Seeds book (coming in August 2019). #Sexyweird merch offerings also include special Kitties tights featuring the lyrics of the songs and the famous third eye Kitten by Phresha Le Vandale (used with permission of the artist), #sexyweird tanks, underwear and halters, the 7 song Shake Yr Sunshine EP (Jai Aquarian's first proper studio release featuring over a a dozen guest vocalists and musicians) in digital or cd form (with lyric sheet in the cd format).
Also on offer, pre-book Jai Aquarian to share a house concert, or live appearance on his Canadian tour mid June to early August, his VoiceBodyLove vocal playshop (suitable for adults or kids) or his brand new full-day offering Empowered Vocal Energetics.  Empowered Vocal Energetics will also be offered as a monthly 10-15 minute video series. It showcases Jai's unique vocal training resources for achieving a more embodied accessto your full, authentic expression.
Should we not achieve the full funding compliment in this campaign, the obvious cuts to expenses will be in scaled down advertising and web-site updating budgets as well as more in-house editing (the hiring of a mentor would speed up the process of our Videographer, Marquie Murphy of Fractal Five Productions) completing the video and help her develop her skill sets in exchange for a lot of donated time and dedication to this project,
Lastly, I paid to make an EP that showcased the wide range of songwriting styles I work with, re-recording the vocals prior to the video release reflects my desire to show how the few live performances of this song have evolved it from the original EP version. Though if i don't meet my target budget I would cover that expense myself. Check out the EP version at https://soundcloud.com/jaiaquarian/kitties-1 and please feel free to like and comment on Soundcloud.
Also, if you want to skip this whole crowdfunding hoopla, you can purchase a physical copy of the album at cdbaby,com through this link: https://hearnow.com/settings/2falb01250971#nt
Or a digital copy of the EP at jaiquarian.bandcamp.com
The bonus of that route, is we get access to those funds immediately, not when the campaign is over.

<h3><u>The Loving Janis story</u></h3>
<p>Featuring the music and life stories of Janis Joplin and Janis Ian, as well as my own, the show takes us on a musical voyage from early girlhood to adulthood. The play weaves a narrative about searching for your own voice and how our influences shape and define us. </p>
<h3><u>Why the show means so much</u></h3>
<p>I started performing in the Young Actor's Workshop in SF at age 13. Discovering how much I loved acting led me to dive into the art form completely, and I moved to LA at 15 to study and pursue it full time. Disillusionment led me to an artist commune at age 20 to attempt a different kind of artistic life! At 25 I moved to Paris to immerse myself in the blues, and music took me over. I returned to the Bay Area in 2007 and began to study music full time. I graduated from the California Jazz Conservatory in 2014. This project brings together so many aspects of my own creative life. It is both thrilling and terrifying, and I feel very lucky to have the opportunity to bring it to an audience. </p>
<h3><u>The show needs your support</u></h3>
<p>This campaign is raising funds to pay for:</p>
<ul>
<li>licensing the Janis Ian &amp; Janis Joplin songs </li>
<li>short theatrical run in late 2019</li>
<li>artist fees for readings and development </li>
<li>marketing and promotion</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<p>The show includes original songs from both Janis Ian and Janis Joplin. One of the reasons for fundraising is to support the licensing fees, which are considerable. Another reason we are raising money is to produce a theatrical run of the play - for specifics, or if you're able to assist in other ways, please email us - any help is appreciated!</p>
<p><u>Funds will be allocated to the following: </u></p>
<ul>
<li>Licenses: Paying all copyright owners a per-performance-fee for use of the songs </li>
<li>Contracts: Paying music licensing company fees to track down and negotiate contracts</li>
<li>Artist Fees for Production &amp; Rehearsal: Performers, Director (Jayne Wenger), Lighting Designer, Art Direction</li>
<li>Marketing </li>
<li>Additional Costs: Venue Rentals, Costumes, Set Design, Projection/Slides</li>
</ul>
<h3><u>&amp; what you get in return</u></h3>
<p>First - you get my sincere gratitude for supporting me and helping me make this dream a reality. But on top of that, you will get one of the following items for each level of contribution:</p>
<ol>
<li>$20+ = CD ""Loving Janis: Live at Ashkenaz""</li>
<li>$50+ = CD + ticket to Ashkenaz event</li>
<li>$100+ = CD + ticket to Ashkenaz event + video of me singing you a song of your choosing</li>
<li>$500+ = CD + 2 tickets to Ashkenaz event + private Kyra Gordon house concert (anywhere in the Bay Area)</li>
<li>$1,000+ = CD + 2 tickets to Ashkenaz event + private Loving Janis house concert performance of the music in the play (anywhere in the Bay Area) </li>

<p>The Evil of Two Lessers</p>
<p>Songwriters Mike Ethan Messick and Ben Morris explore their darker sides on this upcoming joint project, produced by John Evans. The album, which will consist of murder ballads, tales of general mayhem and criminality, is a project 9 years in the making, stemming back to 2011 when Messick &amp; Morris played a handful of shows together and saved up a small-chunk of change to one-day make this record. The scope of the project (how many songs make it on the album), will depend on the generosity of friends and fans and their willingness to participate as ""backers"". There is a loose funding goal of $5000; any amount raised over the target will just keeps things interesting (more $ = more songs, etc.).</p>
<p>Mike Ethan Messick is one of the most respected (and underrated) songwriters in the state of Texas. He has released three full-length albums, 2007's ""Bootlegger's Turn"", 2011's ""The Only Easy Day Was Yesterday"", and 2017's ""How Close We Came"".</p>
<p>Ben Morris has put out two solo albums, ""The Other Side of Broken"" from 2007,  and 2013's ""Amen Brother"", along with 5 projects with his band, The Great American Boxcar Chorus, including the most-recent ""The Violets and the Blues"", from 2018.</p>
<p>All money raised will go towards recording and manufacturing costs associated with recording with an award-winning producer at a state-of-the-art recording studio, Signal Hill studios in Austin, TX.</p>
<p>The perks are simple: pre-order the record on the front end, or hire the duo out for a record-release show/house concert on the back end, and simultaneously help us make the album! If for some reason the goal is not reached, the project is still happening and all money raised will go towards it's release, it just may fewer songs on the album...</p>
<p>We realize that some friends/fans may not be in a position to help this campaign financially; if that is the case you can still help us by sharing this around to help us get the word out! We appreciate any and all support that you are able to throw our way!</p>

<p>Hello, I'm DÓTTIR. An upcoming Danish-Faroese musician who has made a name on the alternative rock scene. I released my first single, Yellow Trees back in 2014, which was followed by a string of concerts in Denmark and the Faroe Islands – where I'm originally from. This led to an invitation to tour Russia in 2015 as part of a Russian/Faroese culture exchange together with Kristian Blak &amp; Yggdrasil and Marius Ziska, which put me in contact with my current label, Tutl.</p>
<p>In April 2017, I released my debut EP “DIVISION” in collaboration with Tutl followed by a tour in Copenhagen and the Faroe Islands. The past year, I've been recording songs for my full-length debut album “SEEKER” expected for release in early 2019. Tutl is a small Faroese record label that is helping me with the distribution, BUT(!) doesn't have much money to pay for studio time, video recordings and that sort of stuff.</p>
<p>DIVISION was a dedication to my roots in the Faroe Islands and the feeling of being divided between two cultures. Growing up in Denmark while longing for the Atlantic Islands, the existential meaning of home has been a central theme in my work, and this is also reflected in my music when I sing in both Faroese and English. The lyrical universe in SEEKER symbolises a search for identity, knowledge, answers, meaning, understanding, love and retreat when life becomes too difficult. They are two very personal pieces and deal with human themes that I think everyone can relate to – which is precisely the purpose of my music.</p>
<p>The sound is a mountain landscape that takes the listener on a dynamic, wondrous and unexpected journey to the North. The music can be described as alternative Nordic rock, moving between intimate and powerful passages in a mythical, captivating and introspective universe. In SEEKER, I extend this audio image, (singing in both Faroese and English), where I explore new areas with a touch of 90's grunge, desert rock, psychedelic rock and anthems from the traditional Faroese singing tradition. It goes on a dark journey into the mind, opening the listener up to hope and redemption and I can't wait to share this with all of you.</p>
<p>I have recorded all the songs and they are right now in the mixing process. I wouldn't have come this far without the funding I've received from Kodas kulturelle midler, DJBFA and Dansk Artist Forbund, but to make it to the end I need your help, so I can pay alle the nice people who has helped me and is helping me with the rest of the production. Your help will help me pay for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Recordings, mix and master of the music</li>
<li>Pressing of the vinyl – because, yeah – I'm releasing on vinyl!</li>
<li>Production of the cover art (and thereby you are also supporting artist Kirstin Helgadóttir)</li>
<li>Production of a music video for the first single</li>
</ul>
<p>All in all I need €2000. Any amount is highly appreciated, but by donating €40 (or more) I will send you a signed vinyl album + a personal ""thank you"" card. Note that this offer only is available for people living in Denmark and in the Faroe Islands (sorry!).</p>
<p>All help is much appreciated and a huge thanks in advance!</p>

This concert ignited my chamber festival imagination and has inspired this leap. I am also inspired by the musicians who have grown up in the Madison area or who have come through to study at UW-Madison.

Stoughton is also where I grew up and a place I think of fondly. Therefore, I want Stoughton to feel that this is their festival, something they can enjoy each summer and to which they can invite the neighboring communities.

The first will be a warm and loving combination of Brahms and Bach, which will feature one of my favorite Brahms compositions, the viola quintet op. 111. Our second program is designed to reflect the Norwegian heritage of Stoughton. The program will pair pieces by both Norwegian and American composers and is shaping up to be really exciting and enjoyable. I think you will have to come see it ;) Both programs will include bits of information about each piece or musical experience during the concert, to further engage thought, enjoyment and understanding for both the experienced and fresh classical music listeners. </p><p>This year's company is made up of musicians from both near and far.

<h3>Who are Kev Minney and Steph Brown?</h3>
<p>Hello from Brighton UK. </p>
<p>We are Kev Minney and Steph Brown and we are two separate independent, professional singer-songwriters. We have toured the UK and Europe extensively and our music has had airplay on stations such as BBC 6 radio music and featured in magazines such as Guitarist and Clash. </p>
<p>We are a couple and although we are two individual artists we work together to make a life of full-time music-making possible. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Your Pre-order makes a difference</h3>
<p>Music is at the center of our lives and we bring music to our community- from the running of a music school to leading a community choir in our home city of Brighton. We support and make our art without compromise.</p>
<p>We have made two heartfelt albums with producer Jag Jago and string arranger Andrew Stuart Buttle and both albums have an atmospheric and orchestral quality coupled with catchy songwriting that gives a nod to 70's icons like Nick Drake and Joni Mitchell. In this process we have hired over 20 local, professional artists - the selling of our records not only secures our future as musicians but also feeds the local musical economy.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Bring our albums to life</h3>
<p>We play a lot of live shows and after two years of hard work making these records we want to print them to take around with us at shows across the UK and Europe but we cannot do this without your help. There are lots of people who are enthusiastic about buying our music in CD and Vinyl but as self-financing musicians getting that initial capital can be really quite difficult after two years of spending to make the albums. Pre-order the records here and help us bring both our albums to print for our live audiences all over the world! </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>It's surprisingly expensive to print a record and the more you print the cheaper it gets. We want to print a substantial amount so we are able to sell our records on tour and keep keeping our expenses covered. To print our records on CD and vinyl will cost us £1500 each for the minimum. amount of copies you can get printed. </p>
<p>In return (depending on your contribution) you will get a limited edition, signed copy of the album in CD or Vinyl delivered directly to your door. Downloads will be sent to you so you also have an electronic copy of the album should you want it. This is the only run that will have a limited edition lyric book accompanying the record designed and especially for you. To add to this both albums will have special design details on the cover to distinguish this first crowdfunded print run from any future print runs!</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>By selling the record before we have made the money to print it there is always a risk if we do not reach our target. We want to assure you as a buyer that if we do not raise enough to print the record in this campaign, we will keep running a presale campaign at our live gigs until we make the money to get our record to you as promised. </p>
<p>As independent musician's we have managed to sculpt our own career in this industry we have overcome many hurdles and we are no strangers to raising money to enable our artistic ambitions, all the same, we need your support.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you want to further help us reach our goal please spread the word about our music and our campaign - make some noise on social media or over a cup of tea with a friend or on your lunch break at the office...</p>
<p>Thank you endlessly for your support</p>

Pre-order the records here and help us bring both our albums to print for our live audiences all over the world! 
 
What We Need & What You Get
It's surprisingly expensive to print a record and the more you print the cheaper it gets. We want to print a substantial amount so we are able to sell our records on tour and keep keeping our expenses covered. To print our records on CD and vinyl will cost us £1500 each for the minimum. amount of copies you can get printed. 
In return (depending on your contribution) you will get a limited edition, signed copy of the album in CD or Vinyl delivered directly to your door. Downloads will be sent to you so you also have an electronic copy of the album should you want it. This is the only run that will have a limited edition lyric book accompanying the record designed and especially for you. To add to this both albums will have special design details on the cover to distinguish this first crowdfunded print run from any future print runs!
 
Risks & Challenges
By selling the record before we have made the money to print it there is always a risk if we do not reach our target. We want to assure you as a buyer that if we do not raise enough to print the record in this campaign, we will keep running a presale campaign at our live gigs until we make the money to get our record to you as promised. 
As independent musician's we have managed to sculpt our own career in this industry we have overcome many hurdles and we are no strangers to raising money to enable our artistic ambitions, all the same, we need your support.
 
Other Ways You Can Help
If you want to further help us reach our goal please spread the word about our music and our campaign - make some noise on social media or over a cup of tea with a friend or on your lunch break at the office...
Thank you endlessly for your support

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Related Costs: Making a full length album, with musicians, studio time, mixing, mastering, artwork and manufacturing - can be very expensive. My last album Otias, cost approximately $20,000.  Regardless, I'm setting the Kickstarter goal to a modest $7,000.  However, I do hope we can reach $20,000 and also reach the stretch goals!</p>
<p>1st Stretch goal: $30,000 - Hospital and Yoga Studio tour -  if we meet this goal, we will plan a tour to hospitals, including children's hospitals, visiting patients to play them the album live and via the album recordings. We'll also plan some performances at yoga studios and alternative venues in cities around the USA (hopefully in the UK too!).  </p>
<p>2nd Stretch goal: $50,000- a crew and I will create a documentary on how music can uplift and inspire people. Ideally, we will film and document the hospital tour.</p>

<p>Clinical studies show that 432 Hz resonates with the Heart Chakra</p>

<p>A=432 Hz, known as Verdi's 'A' is an alternative tuning that is mathematically consistent with the universe. Clinical studies show: Music based on 432Hz transmits beneficial healing energy, because it is a pure tone of math fundamental to nature.</p>
<p>What does 432 Hz do to the brain?</p>
<p>Clinical studies show that 432 Hz music is said to resonate inside the body, releasing emotional blockages and aligning you with the heartbeat of the universe.

Our Stories</b></h2>
<p>In 1992, Dr. Lee Francis III founded Wordcraft
Circle with the vision of creating an organization that would help promote the
works and words of Native American writers and storytellers throughout the
world.  Through strong mentoring and
authentic relationships, Wordcraft became the largest Native mentorship
organization in the United States.  More
than twenty years later, we seek to continue the legacy of Dr. Francis by
renewing and revitalizing the work of Wordcraft Circle for the next generation!</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1319371/files/20150323144910-leeiii_banner.png?1427147350"" src="""" style=""width: 558px; height: 63px;""/></p>
<p>At a time when cultural appropriation runs
rampant and Native communities continue to struggle in the face of poverty and
systematic oppression, it is more important than ever that we, as Native and
Indigenous people, represent ourselves in our own voices!</p><p>Wordcraft has always been a membership-based,
non-profit that has existed upon a shoestring budget.  With your help we can continue to revitalize
our programs, gatherings, and mentorship activities into the next year.  We have a number of exciting ideas but those
ideas take resources to implement and that is why we are reaching out to those
supporters, friends, and allies who wish to see the stories of Native and
Indigenous people heard throughout the world!</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1319316/files/20150323143442-section_break.png?1427146482"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

</p><h4><b>What We Need
&amp; What You Get</b></h4>
<p>Every
year in the Spring, the blessings of rain renew the earth and bring forth the
bounty of our Mother.  Wordcraft is no
different: we need a little rain as well. 
To help us get the flowers blooming, we are seeking a total of
$8500.  This amount, coupled with other
resources, will help get things moving in the right direction.  </p>
<p>What
does this money help us do specifically? 
Read on, dear friends!</p>
<p><i>Communications
&amp; Membership - $1500</i></p>
<p>Getting
the word out about Wordcraft and our projects is critical to our success as an
organization.  This includes: brochures
and media, webhosting, membership support software, and mailings/postage.</p>
<p><i>Gatherings
and RTG - $2000</i></p>
<p>Hosting
gatherings and convenings allows our members and supporters to share and learn
from one another.  Additionally, we are
looking to host RTG, Returning the Gift, a national Native writers conference
that started in 1991.</p>
<p><i>Story
Keepers Project - $2000</i></p>
<p>Our
Story Keepers Project seeks to help engage Native youth in becoming
storytellers and guardians of the stories of their community.  The funds for this project will help pay for
facilitators, workshops, and stipends to community elders/storytellers for
their valuable time.</p>
<p><i>Youth
Literacy Project - $2000</i></p>
<p>Reading
and writing are critical to the success of Native youth and Native communities
and our literacy efforts seek to promote reading and writing from an Indigenous
perspective.  The funds for this will be
used to conduct trainings, workshops and engage technical assistance as
necessary.</p>
<p><i>Organizational
Needs - $1000</i></p>
<p>We are
never sure what lies around the corner. 
We have bills to pay.  We have
trainings to attend.  These funds will be
used to help ensure the organization itself stays healthy.</p>

<h4><b>Your Impact</b></h4>
<p>Too
often our voices are silenced and replaced. 
Our stories are often told by others. 
The work of Wordcraft has always been to promote the authentic stories
of Native and Indigenous people from their own mouths and hands.  Your support for Wordcraft allows us to
continue to be a driving force in these efforts.</p>
<p>As we
have been doing this work for almost 25 years, we know that any of our efforts
pay huge dividends to the people involved. 
Throughout that time, we have worked with thousands of emerging and
professional Native writers and storytellers, many of whom have been published
or who have continued on through their academic pursuits.  Addtionally, we have had numerous critical
successes including: </p>
<p></p><ul>
<li>
<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Publication
of When The Rain Sings, a book of poetry authored by Native youth, as
collaboration between the National Museum of the American Indian and Wordcraft.</span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Development
of The 100 Years Project at the Indian Pueblo Cultural Center, where we engaged
Pueblo youth at five school sites in New Mexico in crafting poems and stories
about their Pueblo experience.</span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">And,
of course, the hundreds of members who have been a part of this organization
throughout the years speak to our experience and capacity for good work!</span><br/>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Ultimately,
we are committed to our mission and vision. 
We are committed to the voices and stories of Native and Indigenous
people.  We are committed to developing
the next generation of writers who will use their words to change the world and
give back to their communities.  We are
committed to ensuring that we, as Native people, are not relegated to the pages
of a history we have not had a hand in writing. 
We are committed to creating a vibrant and dynamic world where the
stories and lives of Native and Indigenous people are honored and celebrated!</p>

<p>Our biggest challenge is capacity.  Always has been.  As such the greatest obstacles toward
reaching our goals will be in getting supporters beyond this campaign; not just
with donations but with time and energy. 
To this end, our main efforts continue to be in developing our
membership and those folks committed to this work to help us reach our
goals.  We have had so many beautiful
supporters, sponsors, and champions throughout the years, we are positive that
we can press forward with all our ideas, projects, and programs once this
campaign concludes.</p>

Our Stories
In 1992, Dr. Lee Francis III founded Wordcraft
Circle with the vision of creating an organization that would help promote the
works and words of Native American writers and storytellers throughout the
world.  Through strong mentoring and
authentic relationships, Wordcraft became the largest Native mentorship
organization in the United States.  More
than twenty years later, we seek to continue the legacy of Dr. Francis by
renewing and revitalizing the work of Wordcraft Circle for the next generation!
At a time when cultural appropriation runs
rampant and Native communities continue to struggle in the face of poverty and
systematic oppression, it is more important than ever that we, as Native and
Indigenous people, represent ourselves in our own voices!Wordcraft has always been a membership-based,
non-profit that has existed upon a shoestring budget.  With your help we can continue to revitalize
our programs, gatherings, and mentorship activities into the next year.  We have a number of exciting ideas but those
ideas take resources to implement and that is why we are reaching out to those
supporters, friends, and allies who wish to see the stories of Native and
Indigenous people heard throughout the world!

What We Need
& What You Get
Every
year in the Spring, the blessings of rain renew the earth and bring forth the
bounty of our Mother.  Wordcraft is no
different: we need a little rain as well. 
To help us get the flowers blooming, we are seeking a total of
$8500.  This amount, coupled with other
resources, will help get things moving in the right direction.  
What
does this money help us do specifically? 
Read on, dear friends!
Communications
& Membership - $1500
Getting
the word out about Wordcraft and our projects is critical to our success as an
organization.  This includes: brochures
and media, webhosting, membership support software, and mailings/postage.
Gatherings
and RTG - $2000
Hosting
gatherings and convenings allows our members and supporters to share and learn
from one another.  Additionally, we are
looking to host RTG, Returning the Gift, a national Native writers conference
that started in 1991.
Story
Keepers Project - $2000
Our
Story Keepers Project seeks to help engage Native youth in becoming
storytellers and guardians of the stories of their community.  The funds for this project will help pay for
facilitators, workshops, and stipends to community elders/storytellers for
their valuable time.
Youth
Literacy Project - $2000
Reading
and writing are critical to the success of Native youth and Native communities
and our literacy efforts seek to promote reading and writing from an Indigenous
perspective.  The funds for this will be
used to conduct trainings, workshops and engage technical assistance as
necessary.
Organizational
Needs - $1000
We are
never sure what lies around the corner. 
We have bills to pay.  We have
trainings to attend.  These funds will be
used to help ensure the organization itself stays healthy.

your help!

helpful in the desert.  So if we don’t
reach our funding goal, we will still use all the contributions in the ways
previously described!  Any bit of rain
and blessings can help us!
Your Impact
Too
often our voices are silenced and replaced. 
Our stories are often told by others. 
The work of Wordcraft has always been to promote the authentic stories
of Native and Indigenous people from their own mouths and hands.  Your support for Wordcraft allows us to
continue to be a driving force in these efforts.
As we
have been doing this work for almost 25 years, we know that any of our efforts
pay huge dividends to the people involved. 
Throughout that time, we have worked with thousands of emerging and
professional Native writers and storytellers, many of whom have been published
or who have continued on through their academic pursuits.  Addtionally, we have had numerous critical
successes including: 


Publication
of When The Rain Sings, a book of poetry authored by Native youth, as
collaboration between the National Museum of the American Indian and Wordcraft.


Development
of The 100 Years Project at the Indian Pueblo Cultural Center, where we engaged
Pueblo youth at five school sites in New Mexico in crafting poems and stories
about their Pueblo experience.


And,
of course, the hundreds of members who have been a part of this organization
throughout the years speak to our experience and capacity for good work!



Ultimately,
we are committed to our mission and vision. 
We are committed to the voices and stories of Native and Indigenous
people.  We are committed to developing
the next generation of writers who will use their words to change the world and
give back to their communities.  We are
committed to ensuring that we, as Native people, are not relegated to the pages
of a history we have not had a hand in writing. 
We are committed to creating a vibrant and dynamic world where the
stories and lives of Native and Indigenous people are honored and celebrated!

reaching our goals will be in getting supporters beyond this campaign; not just
