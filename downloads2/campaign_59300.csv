To create a place where mothers &amp; mothers-to-be (&amp; their support person) can stay in good quality accomodation, eat food grown from my organic garden, choose a yoga class or photography session (or both!) and learn how to take time out to rest and again adore the experience of being a mother. 

*My Story:*       -         
Hi, I'm Hayley. I am a first-time Mum, avid suppporter of mental health and passionate about photography &amp; yoga. My loves combined, my dream is to create a wellbeing retreat that specialises in time out, rest &amp; rejuvenation for women throughout and after their pregnancies. 
My baby, Taliah, was ten months old before I realised that I needed to take a break and do something for myself - instead of looking after both of us, I had focused solely on her and this had left me depleted, tired and listless - not the ideal 'motherhood' I had imagined. I want to create what was not there for me.

*The Plan:*         -
I can not build a retreat like this with $6000, but what I can do is take the first step. I would like to use the money I raise here to complete my teacher training in Yoga Studies, so that I am qualified to take yoga sessions with pre and postnatal women. Whatever amount I raise here will go directly to educating myself further and start the ball rolling to offer women some quality time out.  

My skill set is already varied - I am a secondary school teacher, a gardener, I have a graduate dipolma in Psychology and I am a photographer. Completing a yoga qualification will mean I can tailor my guests' retreat program, without relying on other teachers to come for a one-on-one class, which would be expensive. It allows me to run self-sufficiently and reap the rewards of working closely with my guests, rather than calling in other experts. 

*What you get?*    -
Please see below for your special 'Thank You' gifts. 

      -*Please pass my message on* - share on facebook, twitter or your blog. The more people who see this the more likely we will find people who are willing to share their resources.
      -*Regardless of whether you donate today - being a Mum is at times really hard; it is expected that you will know what to do, instinctively know how to balance your life and be able to cope in all situations - Ask a Mum today (maybe even yours) if you can offer them a little help.* 

*Please make some noise about my campaign - please tell your friends about me and my dream.*

<div>Long time fans of Scott Hall, aka ""Razor Ramon"" have hoped and prayed for his well being for over a decade.  Scott was among the greatest professional wrestlers of all time, and his tragic fall from grace has been widely publicized in the media.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Many wrestling fans have feared he would be the industry's next tragic loss.  But now there's a glimmer of hope.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Scott's longtime friend Diamond Dallas Page, together with the support of Jake ""The Snake"" Roberts, Kevin Nash, and Sean Waltman, have come together to help Scott get healthy and find a purpose in life with his inspiring story of redemption.</div>

<div> </div>
<div>Unfortunately, we didn't know just how broken Scott's body was.  At the young age of 54, Scott has had a pacemaker, and difibrillator implanted for his heart, and he can barely walk due to extreme arthritis in his hip.  Unless he gets a hip replacement, he will be unable to do the necessary exercise in order to get his health back.  Without medical insurance, Scott's inability to pay for the procedures he needs are a major hurdle to his physical recovery.</div>

<h3><strong>40+ Days Clean and Sober</strong></h3>
<div>Today, Scott has been clean and sober over 40 days - longer than he can ever remember outside of a medically supervised environment.  He believes something is very different this time, after 11 trips to rehab.</div>

<p>We're doing everything we can to rebuild Scott, but we're hoping Scott's longtime fans will rally around him, and show him how much love there still is for him.  </p>

<h3>The Fact: $12,000 in medical bills!!!</h3>
<h3>The Epic Story:</h3>
It was April 8th, 2012, a Sunday, Easter Sunday. Anna was working a problem in Joshua Tree on her first big climbing trip of the season, when the unthinkable happened. The thing that every climber knows is a possibility but never thinks will happen to them.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Anna fell from about 15' and landed on the seam of the crash pad.</div>
<div>And...<strong>BAM! EXPLOSION! LEFT ANKLE SHATTER FEST!</strong>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Medical Diagnosis:</h3>
<strong>Injury: </strong>Left posterior talar body fracture. Left talar head fracture. Left posterior tibial tendon sublaxation.</div>
<div><strong> </strong></div>
<div>
<strong>Treatment: </strong>Surgery #1: insertion of an external fixator (now removed and in a bag in her closet). Surgery #2: insertion of nine screws and two plates. Several months of physical therapy and gimping around the gym. Now, Surgery #3: removal all the hardware they can and partial hindfoot fusion (???) and muscular hernia repair.</div>
<div>
<h3>The Reality of the Situation:</h3>
Medical bills suck for an epic series of operations like this. Medical bills suck more when you are 25 years old and work at a climbing gym full time. If you have good health insurance, you've probably never even seen a full hospital bill. Count yourself lucky. Listen to this NPR Planet Money podcast to get some perspective: <a href=""http://www.npr.org/blogs/money/2013/02/26/172996963/episode-439-the-mysterious-power-of-a-hospital-bill"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Episode 439: The Mysterious Power Of A Hospital Bill</a>.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>We all live hard lives as climbers, but if you're one of the lucky ones who is still sprinting up rocks with BOTH FEET, take a minute to think about what you would do if you fell on the seam and shattered your ankle.</div>

She is the love of my life, my sunshine, she makes me happy when skies are gray. I’ve been in a custody battle for her for 3 years now. The sad part is, well, the whole thing is sad really. Her dad is trying to take her away from me. He wants me to only have her every other weekend, supervised. Not because I do drugs or drink because I don’t, but because he is still hurt. His way to hurt me now is to take my daughter from me. I’m a great mom! I take her to girl scouts, <em>she is a daisy</em>! I help her with her homework. I make her cute bento box lunches because I LOVE to. She is bright, caring, and gentle and she loves <strong>both</strong> her parents, just as she should. All she wants is equal time with both her parents, that’s what I want to.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I haven’t had my daughter for a weekend since February 2011. I haven’t been able to take her to any of the local festivals, like the strawberry fest, the chocolate fest, or even Aiken’s Makin, a local arts and crafts show. I haven’t even been able to take her to a birthday party! I get her for her birthday this year, it falls on a Tuesday, when I asked to have her on a Saturday for a few hours to throw her a party and have some of her friends over her dad said no, because it is <strong>HIS</strong> time. I get that a lot, <em>HIS</em> time. I think it’s <strong>HER</strong> time.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>This is why I need help. I cannot pay my legal fees. If I don’t pay them I lose my lawyer AND I can be held in contempt and serve time in jail. If I lose my lawyer I have to represent myself in court, even with a case as good as mine I don’t know how to do this. I also have to pay for her Guardian ad Litem, the woman who is responsible for deciding what is in Bella’s best interest. Along with her I also owe to a judge who attempted to mediate between her dad and I to try and come to an agreement. I <strong>BEGGED</strong> to avoid this step, I knew he would not agree to anything reasonable and it would just be <em>another</em> senseless bill, but the court said it had to happen. I can’t tell you what happened because it’s still a pending trial; let’s just say “reasonable” is not in his vocabulary.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> I lost my job in December 2011, due to health reasons and lack of Paid Time off and an error when filing for FMLA. Companies have rules and the company I worked for was unable to re-file paper work to correct the error. I’ve been looking for work since but I can’t just take a normal job, that’s what got me to this point to begin with. Until the custody is settled I need to have a job where I am home with her when she is with me. I haven’t found one yet. (I do have an interview on October 8<sup>th</sup> though! So keep me in your thoughts and prayers please!)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Here’s where it get’s worse. My husband also has not been able to find work. We had to move to this somewhat small town in order for me to be close enough to Bella. I used to have to drive her 25 miles to get her to school, 25 back home and unless I wanted to sit around here for 6 hours waiting for her to get out of school it was a double trip. So he has been unemployed, and his unemployment ran out 4 weeks ago. Mine will be up in 3 weeks. So to add to the legal bills I have no idea how I am going to pay our rent, our electric or our phones to hopefully get that job call.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>What finally put me over the edge and the reason why I am now typing this is because my lawyer called today to tell my that my ex is now filing a contempt charge on me for a joint credit card he and I used to have that I have been unable to pay off. Of course it is affecting his credit too (never mind that this man has never held a full time job in his life and he is 37, or that he lives rent free thanks to his parents, who also pay all his legal fees. Had I had a lawyer for our divorce you better believe I would not have taken all our marital debt, debt that was accumulated because the only way to pay for groceries was to put it on a credit card because he barely worked and I couldn’t do it on my own). So because I can’t pay the card, I’m going to be sued for the amount of the balance plus his legal fees and since I can’t pay those either I’ll go to jail.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I am not a bad person. I am down on my luck so to speak. I’ve been in tough times before but I always find a way to pull through them. I know that there are people far worse off than me too, which is why it is very hard for me to do this. I HATE that I am asking for help, but what other choice do I have? I can’t lose my daughter. I can’t lose our home. When I say that I will pay forward everything that comes from this, I mean it with every fiber of my being! I believe that God does not take you to something unless he can take you through it, maybe this is how, I don’t know. I just have to believe that a small miracle is here waiting for me. We already have one, my husband was contacted this week about a great job. A job that would turn our lives around for the better. It’s in Virginia, though and that has it’s own obstacles.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>If you can find it in your heart to help me and my family I would be so grateful. My daughter will be grateful. It might just be the small miracle we need to move past this chapter in our lives and into one full of promise and hope. I’ve seen the good that comes from communities reaching out, I’ve been part of that good in helping do my part many times, and it’s a great feeling. I hope you know what I mean. I hope you can see my plea for what it is. If you feel moved by this but cannot contribute please pass my story along, you never know, and please keep my family in your prayers! Thank you for taking the time to read this and God Bless you!</p></div>","You know that song, “you are my sunshine”? That’s my daughter Bella, she will be 7 next month.

I haven’t been able to take her to any of the local festivals, like the strawberry fest, the chocolate fest, or even Aiken’s Makin, a local arts and crafts show. I haven’t even been able to take her to a birthday party! I get her for her birthday this year, it falls on a Tuesday, when I asked to have her on a Saturday for a few hours to throw her a party and have some of her friends over her dad said no, because it is HIS time. I get that a lot, HIS time. I think it’s HER time.
 
This is why I need help. I cannot pay my legal fees. If I don’t pay them I lose my lawyer AND I can be held in contempt and serve time in jail. If I lose my lawyer I have to represent myself in court, even with a case as good as mine I don’t know how to do this. I also have to pay for her Guardian ad Litem, the woman who is responsible for deciding what is in Bella’s best interest. Along with her I also owe to a judge who attempted to mediate between her dad and I to try and come to an agreement. I BEGGED to avoid this step, I knew he would not agree to anything reasonable and it would just be another senseless bill, but the court said it had to happen. I can’t tell you what happened because it’s still a pending trial; let’s just say “reasonable” is not in his vocabulary.
 
 I lost my job in December 2011, due to health reasons and lack of Paid Time off and an error when filing for FMLA. Companies have rules and the company I worked for was unable to re-file paper work to correct the error. I’ve been looking for work since but I can’t just take a normal job, that’s what got me to this point to begin with. Until the custody is settled I need to have a job where I am home with her when she is with me. I haven’t found one yet. (I do have an interview on October 8th though! So keep me in your thoughts and prayers please!)
 
Here’s where it get’s worse. My husband also has not been able to find work. We had to move to this somewhat small town in order for me to be close enough to Bella. I used to have to drive her 25 miles to get her to school, 25 back home and unless I wanted to sit around here for 6 hours waiting for her to get out of school it was a double trip. So he has been unemployed, and his unemployment ran out 4 weeks ago. Mine will be up in 3 weeks. So to add to the legal bills I have no idea how I am going to pay our rent, our electric or our phones to hopefully get that job call.
 
What finally put me over the edge and the reason why I am now typing this is because my lawyer called today to tell my that my ex is now filing a contempt charge on me for a joint credit card he and I used to have that I have been unable to pay off. Of course it is affecting his credit too (never mind that this man has never held a full time job in his life and he is 37, or that he lives rent free thanks to his parents, who also pay all his legal fees. Had I had a lawyer for our divorce you better believe I would not have taken all our marital debt, debt that was accumulated because the only way to pay for groceries was to put it on a credit card because he barely worked and I couldn’t do it on my own). So because I can’t pay the card, I’m going to be sued for the amount of the balance plus his legal fees and since I can’t pay those either I’ll go to jail.
 
I am not a bad person. I am down on my luck so to speak. I’ve been in tough times before but I always find a way to pull through them. I know that there are people far worse off than me too, which is why it is very hard for me to do this. I HATE that I am asking for help, but what other choice do I have? I can’t lose my daughter. I can’t lose our home. When I say that I will pay forward everything that comes from this, I mean it with every fiber of my being! I believe that God does not take you to something unless he can take you through it, maybe this is how, I don’t know. I just have to believe that a small miracle is here waiting for me. We already have one, my husband was contacted this week about a great job. A job that would turn our lives around for the better. It’s in Virginia, though and that has it’s own obstacles.
 
If you can find it in your heart to help me and my family I would be so grateful. My daughter will be grateful. It might just be the small miracle we need to move past this chapter in our lives and into one full of promise and hope. I’ve seen the good that comes from communities reaching out, I’ve been part of that good in helping do my part many times, and it’s a great feeling. I hope you know what I mean. I hope you can see my plea for what it is. If you feel moved by this but cannot contribute please pass my story along, you never know, and please keep my family in your prayers!

                                           Our Story
 Hello! Thanks for visiting our page! Some of you know us, and some of you don't so here's a little more about us. My name is Jamie, and I'm married to a wonderful man named Christopher we have been together for six years and married for two years tears swell up in my eyes as I write this letter in hopes that others will see the pain, I have endured the dream we once sat down to talk about is still just a dream.
Not so many days have passed since the last baby shower I attended to realize that it wasn't for me yet only a reminder of what I want and still do not have the smile across my face when I hear the great news of others expecting suddenly is over taken by the pain and constant reminder of the battle we have been through am so happy for them yet it hurts me inside, is it selfish to feel pain when others are so happy?
When we made the decision to get pregnant, we had dreams of jumping for joy when the pregnancy test showed positive what the faces of our family and friends would be like when we shared the great news and how the nursery would look like in pink or blue. We never dreamed of the challenges that were placed in front of us from our dream of having a family.
Christopher and i both were diagnosed with infertility causes after over two years with no success I with a ( Pituitary Microadenoma) which is a benign tumor of the pituitary gland with a diameter less than 10mm, and Christopher has unbalanced hormones he has high FSH levels, which cause him to have a condition known as (Oligospermis) or low sperm count your sperm count is considered lower than normal if you have fewer than 20 million sperm per mililiter of semen(he has less than 2 million).
We have put in many years of treatment with no success. We often ask ourselves is it a dream too good to be true? The smile we put on our faces that everyone sees hides the pain we endure. Chris often reminds me that there is always light at the end of the tunnel, but for me that light has dimmed failure after failure my wonderful husband has never left my side for he is the one who pushes me through our failed attempts. For the past nine years, I've worked as a childcare provider as well as a nanny.
I have committed my life to nurturing other peoples children. After years of trying to conceive without i success, IVF is our final option. If I am guility of grievous attachment to one particular expectation for my life, it is the idea that I will certainly, absolutely, have a child, a soft, smiling baby with those curiously small toes who will complete my purpose on earth, and make me whole.
                                        The Impact
 Christopher and I have gone back and forth discussing if this was a “good idea” to post this information online and let the world into this personal and difficult journey we've been on. There are pros and cons that always come up. For starters, there is not a guarantee.This procedure might not work. In In addition, many in our lives will be shocked to hear this has been going on for four years. 
We hope this will not change the way they treat us and that they will feel comfortable talking about this with us. We must prepare ourselves for the questions and comments that will come,many of which we have dodged by facing theses difficulties with only a few close friends, coworkers and family memebers.
 All that to say, we can NOT do this without you. The deeper we get into this, the harder it is to pretend like life is great. If we say no to dinner invites to save money, we want you to know why we are saving money. However,after much thought and prayer, we know the pros outweigh the cons.Sharing our story with you, could result in two things. With your help we could become pregnant and have a baby!

Overall, this is a scary thing for us to admit and if there are others dealing with this too, we'd love to hear from you!
I know for some who will read this it may be a lot to swallow. But take heart that even though 
momth after month our lives are filled with defeat, we are not giving up! Through it all we have and will remain hopeful that, someday, we will have the family we want. We know we are ment to be parents,and when that day comes,all of this will be worth it! With the help of an amazing group of 
doctors, the support of our awesome family and friends, and strength from God, we believe we will have a baby! We are choosing not to let the lack of expenses hold us back. We are inviting all of our Family,Friends, and anyone who feels led to support us to become a part of our “ Baby Heard Journey”! 1 in 10 couples suffer from infertility. I am hoping that with this being sent out it will help bring awareness to everyone as well as comfort and hope to those who also are fighting this battle.

-Insemination of my little eggies using (ICSI) Which is pronounced ick-see, stands for intracytoplasmic sperm injection ICSI may be used as part of an IVF treatment. In normal IVF, many sperm are placed together with an egg, in hopes that one of the sperm will enter and fertilize the egg. With ICSI, the embryologist takes a single sperm and injects it directly into an egg. 
-Embryo culture and transfer from cycle (Take the eggies out/put the eggies back in)
-Blood pregnancy test folling transfer
-Fertility Medication around $4,200
 We will never be able to thank you enough for the gift you are trying to give us. There are no words that could describe what your donations mean to us. We'll share with our little one(s) each one of your names and the journey we all took together to get them here. More than anything, Thank you for joing us on this Journey! Thank you for being apart of our lives.Thank you for believing our dream could become a reality.
Other ways you can help
 We know that times are tough and understand if you cannot donate. However there are other ways you could help by just spreading the word. You can post this page on any site such as Facebook,Twitter,and Linkedin.
Additionally for every dollar amount that we receive over our goal, we will be donating it to other families like ours. Most Couples that suffer from infertility have no insurance that covers treatment and will never have athe chance to try IVF.
We truly appreciate all of your support and look forward to sharing some happy news with everone down the line.
We are more than ready to move on to the Family phase of our life and the fun,stress,laughs,tears,sleeplessness,silliness,love,and joy that comes with being parents :)
To give away money is an easy matter and in any man's power. But to decide to whom to give it, and how large,and when,and for what purpose and how, is neither in anyman's power nor an easy matter...   -Aristole",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>We are very excited to bring to you again our 4th most amazing tour of them all! Pedaling from Minnesota to Mississippi to enlighten the public of the misconceptions of the organic world.  Our previous tours enabled us to reach out to the nation in venues who may not have otherwise heard our message.  We were very successful in helping the Organic Consumer’s Association in gathering many signatures for the Proof in Labeling petition during our stops on our previous tours. We need YOUR participation to keep our mission alive and the tours going to share the organic awareness to the world.  We need YOU to help us say NO to GMO / Monsanto and we need YOU to help us stand up for our food and health freedoms.</p>

<p>Our Fuel for the Body Team believes it would be very beneficial for you or your company to come aboard our team in any way you can.  This will enable us to reach the masses and get some myths straightened out.  We reach a public who would not otherwise hear our message.   This time we are cycling from Minneapolis, MN to Gulfport, MS.   Oct. 1 thru 31. This tour will conclude in 30 days to complete a 1530 mile journey.  We will empower the world again on organic and healthy lifestyles while at the same time speaking OUT against Monsanto and standing UP for <strong>your food and health FREEDOMS</strong>!  Lynnette brings you enlightenment on these issues.</p>
<p>We want to thank those companies who have already come aboard our amazing mission tours. We look forward to having <strong>YOU </strong>as part of our team to help us empower the nation.  <strong>With out you, we cannot keep the tours going</strong>. Let YOUR voices be heard!

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<ul>
<li>We need the <em>$15,000</em> to fund the entire 30 day tour.  We have funded the last three tours out of pocket and with the help of a few sponsors. (our other sponsors help with super foods)  This $$ goes entirely to the tour, advertising in papers, radio and etc.  Also we NOW have 5 people touring. (4 riders and support vehicle driver)  Therefore, food and extra gear for each person.  As well as extra hotel room for the extra people.  Of course we do couch surfing as much as we can, however the more people we have the harder it is to find a couch surfing family to host us.</li>
<li>We need to make a HUGE impact during October as we push to get our foods labeled. Also pays for the awesome banner we make for each tour, flyers, literature to pass out (as we make many more copies of everything along the tour since we run out often). The $$ also affords us gas for the support vehicle, &amp; other miscellaneous for 5 people and our ""Fueling"" foods for 30 days.</li>
<li>The perks you get are awesome!  Pleasea view all the perks to the side to see what you get for your kind support. Also see gallery for pics.  You get YOUR NAME mentioned in our THANK YOUS on all our blogs, social media pages, website and depending on how much you contribute, you will get your name on our banner. Please see sponsorship on our website:  <a href=""http://www.fuelforthebody.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.fuelforthebody.org</a> </li>
<li>The only perks that were given to us on sponsorship are:  Manitoba Harvest protein powders and the oil.  All other perks were purchased at a discount from Lynnette Pate already.</li>
<li>Even if we do not raise the complete <em>$15,000</em>, then all we raise DEFINITELY helps our mission.  There are always UN Expected expenses that come up, such as brakes for the car, new tires (for car and bikes), oil change and etc as we experienced on our last tour from Washington to AZ.  Due to the rough terrain on the routes in Nevada and AZ mountains.  ;-)  So as you can see, the $$ will be well appreciated.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<ul>
<li>Our project is vital to the nation.  We speak in high schools, colleges and different events to enlighten the public on WHO Monsanto is and WHAT GMO's are and MSG's. WE have been very successful in reaching a nation already who would not have had any idea of what is in their food supply.  WE EMPOWER the nation in a POSITIVE way.  Lynnette's book helps you to better understand all this.</li>
<li>You can see our success of previous tours via facebook:  <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/fuelforthebody"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.facebook.com/fuelforthebody</a> you can see photos, stops, and all events.</li>
<li>You will also<strong> 'bee'</strong> delighted to know that by helping fund this tour, you will be helping us to help the Project: <strong><em>HONEY COLONY with Maryam Henein, producer of Vanishing of the Bees. </em> </strong><strong>We have joined forces to have an even larger impact on the nation.  </strong><em>We MUST save our pollinators.  Using toxic pesticides, weed killers and GMO seeds, all poison and kill the bees.  DON'T LET THIS HAPPEN.</em>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Want to know who puts THEIR TRUST in us?</strong> WE have some GREAT national companies who help give us super food snacks for the tour as well as give us samples &amp; coupons to pass out to the public on each stop. Or they are great promotional supporters &amp; sponsors.   You can see them on our webpages and fan pages.  To name a few:  <strong>Manitoba Harvest, Celtic Sea Sale, Organic Consumers Association, Guayaki Yerba Mate, Navitas Naturals, Natures Path Organic Foods, Ecco Bella and Core Health Products, Ashley Koff RD (Ashley Koff Approved), NON GMO Project.</strong>

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>My name is Valeria Lopez, I am 25 years old. I met Victor 5 years ago and we were married immediately. We were meant for each other and had been happily married - until February 20, 2012. On our way back from Tijuana with 6 other family members and friends, after traveling hundreds of miles, our driver lost control of the SUV we were traveling in, and we flipped over as we took our freeway exit (E. Capitol Expressway) a few blocks away from our home. Victor, who was 30, died on impact after being ejected and trampled by the vehicle. I was also ejected from the vehicle - breaking my leg and spine at the neck.  I am telling my story to the IndieGoGo community because I need help with covering medical and funeral expenses for this tragic event.  When the accident happened, I was just starting up my own small business.  Unfortunately, I wasn't covered by medical insurance, and so have to face this horrible situation uninsured.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Victor and I had just purchased our first home and I more than likely will not be able to maintain it. I will need extensive therapeutic care after the 12-hour surgery to rebuild my spine, and will need constant care. My mother has offered to move to San Jose from Mexico to take care of me. My family and I have exhausted any savings we had and are in need of help.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Any and all funds raised will go to cover my medical bills, therapy, and Victor's funeral services. Whatever amount I can raise through the help of the online community will go a long way to helping us pay off these bills, which have surpassed six digits. My family and friends will also be holding events, car washes, raffles, etc. to raise more funds.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>When you donate, my family and friends will say thank you with a modest act of kindness. I will send you images of the fundraising events, updates on my recuperation/progress, traditional Mexican dish recipes, and anything else we can upon request.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>You can also help us by saying a little prayer, and I ask you to please spread the word for my cause. Tools such as Twitter, Facebook, blogs, etc. will help amplify my plea.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>God bless you.</p>

Any and all funds raised will go to cover my medical bills, therapy, and Victor's funeral services. Whatever amount I can raise through the help of the online community will go a long way to helping us pay off these bills, which have surpassed six digits. My family and friends will also be holding events, car washes, raffles, etc. to raise more funds.

When you donate, my family and friends will say thank you with a modest act of kindness. I will send you images of the fundraising events, updates on my recuperation/progress, traditional Mexican dish recipes, and anything else we can upon request.

Other Ways You Can Help
You can also help us by saying a little prayer, and I ask you to please spread the word for my cause. Tools such as Twitter, Facebook, blogs, etc. will help amplify my plea.

God bless you.",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

 recently taken very ill in  Panama and was hospitalized and showing no real 
sign of recovery. She  desperately needs to return to Canada so she can 
receive free health  care and critical surgery to  save her  life. The reason we are raising money is that an emergency helicopter and emergency air crew are needed to transport Maeva back to Canada and keep her alive. This will cost roughly $45,000 and the funds raised will go towards this to help the family cover these expenses.

In many cases, despite several therapies and interventions, we are seeing little progress with our children.  Many of our children need constant care and multiple caregivers.  This care is complicated by a lack of transparency and coordination between caregivers.
      How it worksWe have developed unique tools
and a separate portal for each caregiver around an autistic individual.  The entire care team child
will create a comprehensive baseline of the child’s diagnosis, treatments and
other non-medical interventions on our web platform.  Then each
caregiver including parents will
input daily care data in a simple and easy to use mobile application.
They can
then track their child’s progress along educational and behavioral goals as
well as understand their child’s responsiveness to medications and other
interventions.  Early
intervention is a key aspect of improving progress and outcomes for your
autistic child.  The app’s coordination
and intelligent tools will ensure that the right people are alerted where
attention and intervention is needed.   
           
                                        

AVA is an
intelligent platform. When it has enough data about your child and about other
children with autism, it develops associations between the diagnosis and all different
therapies and interventions used and it will develop ways of recommending
potential treatments and interventions and medications that may work best for
your child based on the patterns it finds.  This will allow the physicians to create a treatment plan that is outcomes driven and personalized for your child.
This is the true promise of personalized
medicine.       Where we are
We need to add a few new features to the app and roll it out across a larger community.  We are raising $1 million to grow the product, engineering, and patient support teams. We have raised some of the funds from multiple sources.  We are trying to raise $50,000 from our community - from those that have been impacted by Autism or any disease, from those that understand the complexities of raising a child with a life long disease, and from anyone who is as excited as we are about changing healthcare delivery at its foudnation by focusing on what matters the most - the patient. Perks






        Our Roadmap                           Our Impact
AVA Health solves an important Autism and healthcare problem.   The platform has a direct impact on improving care for every patient.  Parents can track their child's progress and make more informed decisions about program choices.  Real-time access to patient data enables physicians to intervene early in case progress is slow or treatments are ineffective.   Special Education teachers, therapists, and other care providers can quickly track a child's progress in the context of all other treatments and tailor programs more effectively.  This collective effort and early intervention will potentially lead to improved outcomes for patients.  Additionally, through advanced analytics on comprehensive data around patients, the AVA platform will help advance our knowledge of Autism and define predictive models for more effective treatments, drug development, and potentially even prevention. 
Use Case        Potential Risks
As with other software applications, AVA faces the adoption challenge.  While we feel that we have addressed this challenge with engaging features and incentives, there is always the risk that parents, care providers, and physicians may not engage with the platform.  Also, similar to other healthcare software companies, while we have built a fully compliant platform and have thought about every potential aspect of compliance, there is always a risk of intervention by regulatory agencies.  Finally, like all start-ups, we always face the challenges of not getting fully funded and having to adjust milestones and timelines accordingly.  This may delay our execution and full roll-out of our platform.       How you can help us
There are so many ways you could help us.  You could of course contribute to this campaign and help us get to or exceed our goal so we can continue to build an amzaing product and roll-it out across the community.  You can also join us as a partner or as a member of our Beta Program.  Finally, a great way to help AVA is by spearding the word to anyone who may be interested in supporting us either in the campaign, as a partner, or as a member of our Beta Program.",22.0,2,"1 Campaign

<p>The reason I am doing so well is that I have a loving family.
My Dad, Charlee Dollens, takes awesome care of me all day. My dad gave up a lot so that
I could stay in our home. I also have great homecare nurses 8 hours a day and
wonderful friends. All of them keep me going. I like to get out and do things
as much as I can. I like to go to movies, concerts and out to eat once in a while.
I like going on the trails in the summer. I love going to the shopping malls. I
enjoy conversations with people and I’m a computer nut.</p>
<p>I have done a lot of things in my life, including lots of
traveling etc.  My biggest accomplishment
was in November 2006, when I was 29. After a three year pursuit, I achieved a
HUGE first for the adaptive scuba community. I was the first ventilator
dependent individual in the world to dive in the ocean. To learn more about my

<p>I
would like to have a seat elevator for my new power wheel chair. (model is
Permobil M300) My current chair is on its last leg. Medical Assistance won’t
cover the 8” power seat elevator, but they have approved everything else for
it. The seat elevator would make my life much easier. I need to raise $3,400.  I have tried to have this approved several
times with my current chair, but have been refused each time. They are refusing
the seat elevator with my new chair also.  Medical Assistance will only approve it if you
can get yourself in and out of bed.  I
may not be able to use the seat elevator to get myself in and out of bed, but
it would greatly increase the quality of my life.  It would help my care givers also.  It would be easier to transfer me in and out
of the chair if I could raise my seat up. 
Also, it would help with lowering the seat to fit under tables and
raising up the seat to sit at counters. 
I also get eyestrain and headaches from looking at things higher
up.  I also get neck aches from looking
at people who are towering over me. 
Sometimes I can barely see their faces, I am so much lower in the chair.</p>

<div>Hi my name is Stephanie Piegzik. I am fundraising for a baby angel. This little angels name is Bailey. Bailey is currently 8 months old and weighs only 12 lbs. she has spent all but four weeks of her little life in the hospital for testing, life saving surgeries, and recovery time. </div>
<div>She has had open heart surgery, surgery to repair a hole in her GI, cranial surgery to reverse the premature fusion of the growth plates in her skull, surgery to repair a hole in her intestines, 4 blood transfusions, and she still needs another surgery to remove and reroute a section of her bowel that is not functioning - this causes her bowels to get severely backed up, bloating her and causing serious pain and she has been on a feeding tube since she was 6 weeks old. Most likely when all of her surgeries are finished, she will need to be on meds for quite some time, then meds to get off of the meds. </div>
<div>She smiles every day. </div>
<div>Below is an article from Phoenix Children's Hospital where Bailey was nominated Heart Hero - Mended Little Hearts of the Month. The article, by Mom, explains in more depth what little Bailey has been going through.</div>
<div>
<img class=""lazy"" data-src="""" src="""" style=""""/><span style="""">The underlying problem is one parent has been unable to work for almost a year now to be by Baileys side. Medical bills are piling up, and the family's insurance year is coming to an end at the end of October. November 1st, the hospital will not be able to treat Bailey until the family can meet their insurance deductible first. </span><br/>
</div>
<p>I know I would be so scared to be in that situation. With a tiny life at stake, and money holding necessary procedures and medical care at bay. It's frightening just to think of the fear my sister and her family must feel right now.</p> </div> <div> <h3>What we need and what you get:</h3> <ul>
<li>The Fletcher Family needs a minimum of $10,000 to pay their annual deductible and to help them pay some of their mounting medical bills.

She smiles every day. 
Below is an article from Phoenix Children's Hospital where Bailey was nominated Heart Hero - Mended Little Hearts of the Month. The article, by Mom, explains in more depth what little Bailey has been going through.

The underlying problem is one parent has been unable to work for almost a year now to be by Baileys side. Medical bills are piling up, and the family's insurance year is coming to an end at the end of October. November 1st, the hospital will not be able to treat Bailey until the family can meet their insurance deductible first. 

I know I would be so scared to be in that situation. With a tiny life at stake, and money holding necessary procedures and medical care at bay. It's frightening just to think of the fear my sister and her family must feel right now.   What we need and what you get: 
The Fletcher Family needs a minimum of $10,000 to pay their annual deductible and to help them pay some of their mounting medical bills. A year in the hospital with 24 hr care is unbelievably expensive. Your generosity will help this baby angel get her bowel surgery she needs. Without this, she may be on a feeding tube for much longer.  If the entire goal is not met, the money raised will still go towards the family's insurance  deductible. They have no choice in the matter. November 1st, the hospital will have to release her wether it's safe or not. This is so serious, I'm not even sure I have the words to explain how urgent the situation is. Hopefully I have been able to share their story and needs clearly. 
  The Impact 
Your donation will be helping one of the nicest, most loving families ever. Help me help them by choosing to be a hero. You can make a difference.  This little angel ""Bailey"" needs your help. 

  Other Ways You Can Help Some people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean they can't help: 
Please share Baileys story on your Facebook, Instagram, Twitter or any other social media that could help Bailey and her family.  Remember to use the Indiegogo share tools. Tell your friends, co-workers, and if your way of contributing is through prayer, we gladly accept prayers too.

<h3>Join a Movement to Preserve Family Stories - Including Yours.</h3>
<p>Family. </p>
<p>Roots. </p>
<p>Identity.</p>
<p>Our parents, grandparents, and mentors have shaped each of us in undeniable but often unexplored ways. In their humanity, they have done their best to give us all they can, even as they navigate their own journeys, longings, and past.</p>
<p>For instance, how well do I understand what it was like for my father growing up as a potential draftee in the shadows of the Vietnam War? In what ways did that impact the course of his life? </p>
<p>And, what were your grandmother’s favorite stories about your grandfather? What marriage advice would she offer after decades of lessons learned?</p>
<p><strong>We, personally and as a society, are losing the unique, vital, and profound opportunity to process and preserve the life stories of our families and communities. </strong></p>
<p>But now, you can back a project dedicated to making it possible for everyone’s heritage and legacy to be preserved, including yours. </p>
<p><i>“The beauty of the written word is that it can be held close to the heart and read over and over again.” </i>-Florence Littauer</p>
<p>Legacy Kept is a website that makes it simple (and fun) for anyone to answer thoughtful interview questions about their life, and then easily print the finished project as a beautiful hardcover book. These books will be cherished gifts, passed down to family and friends for generations. Their stories, in their own words, preserved in writing.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>How It Works</h3>
<p>Each account provides total freedom in the process. We imagine some Legacy writers will work on their own, answering questions at their pace; some will find a partner (spouse, sibling, friend) to help each other along the way; and some will need support (a son or daughter, grandchild, social worker, or nurse), to type answers during regular visits or phone calls. Here's how the site works:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Answer provided questions to help write your life story.</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://media.giphy.com/media/kdiZsf94NALF43196c/giphy.gif"" src=""""/> </p>

<p>It was just a thought. My dad was dying, and over the course of that year I had a lot of time to think. I thought about the time we spent together when I was a kid. I thought about the time we spent together when he moved into my house late in life. I thought about how little I knew of him.</p>
<p>I wondered why we pay such great attention to distributing the ""what"" when someone dies, but so little attention to capturing the ""who."" It doesn't seem right.

<p>For as far back as I can remember, I've loved listening to stories. My grandfather's were among my favorite—I really could listen to him talk about his childhood in England for hours. Something about the sharing of these stories felt sacred to me; I felt connected to my grandfather, and my heritage, when he told them. I hadn't imagined what life would be like without getting to hear these stories whenever I wanted. He was the greatest of storytellers. </p>
<p>In the wake of losing my grandfather, my dad shared an idea to create a website that would allow people to preserve their family stories in writing, so they could be cherished for generations. I was on board immediately. In creating this website, we've really tried to take the overwhelm out of the writing process and make it accessible to anyone, so that our family legacies won't be lost. </p>

<p>Introducing Clean Air, Clair. Clair B, bring clean air with you everywhere you go. Clair B is a portable air purifier that utilizes dual filtration technology.

<p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">Similar to a powerful magnet, Clair B’s unique air filtration system holds an electrostatic charge thereby causing particles to be strongly attracted to it. Harnessing the power of static electricity, the same principle that made your hair stick to a balloon when you rubbed it on your head, Clair B attracts polarized contaminants.</span><br/></p>
<p>The electret film filter is capable of eliminating ultrafine dust (smaller than 0.1 micrometers ?m), allergens, pollen, mold, cigarette smoke, exhaust gasses and more. The filter is made of an embossed polypropylene film, a self-charging electrostatic material, wrapped in a cylindrical shape, and our patented design allows the polypropylene to hold charged sides. </p>
<p>The filter’s area is nearly twelve times larger than that of a standard mini-HEPA filter thus, maximizing efficiency. This also gives the filter a longer life span. A single mini-electret filter can last four months, and when it is time for replacement, you simply twist the bottom off and lift the filter out. </p>

As chemical molecules and other biological agents enter the charging section they collide with ions, gaining that ion’s static charge. The now charged particles pass on to the trapping section and are filtered out of your environment. </span><br/></p>

<p>Clair B’s attractive design fits with any décor. With its basic two-toned design, Clair B is elegant in its simplicity thereby matching the aesthetic of any environment in which it is placed. Simple, Classic and Portable. That was the emphasis of Clair B's design. </p>

</div></div>","Introducing Clean Air, Clair. Clair B, bring clean air with you everywhere you go. Clair B is a portable air purifier that utilizes dual filtration technology. By combining the power of an plasma ionizer and our patented electret film filter, we are able to exceed HEPA standards and achieve 99.97% filtration efficiency and eliminate 0.1 micrometer (?m) sized particles.



Clair B's unique swivel vent provides 180 degrees rotation providing fresh and clean air in any direction!  
Running at 5 volts gives you maximum portability. Connect to your computer, the cigar jack in the car, a smartphone charger or a portable power bank.


Our Magnetic Air Filtration (MAF) technology filters micro dust particles as small as 0.1?m, viruses, bacteria, allergens, pollen, VOC (volatile organic compounds) and even harmful chemicals.




Electret filter attracting particles through static electricity


Similar to a powerful magnet, Clair B’s unique air filtration system holds an electrostatic charge thereby causing particles to be strongly attracted to it. Harnessing the power of static electricity, the same principle that made your hair stick to a balloon when you rubbed it on your head, Clair B attracts polarized contaminants.
The electret film filter is capable of eliminating ultrafine dust (smaller than 0.1 micrometers ?m), allergens, pollen, mold, cigarette smoke, exhaust gasses and more. The filter is made of an embossed polypropylene film, a self-charging electrostatic material, wrapped in a cylindrical shape, and our patented design allows the polypropylene to hold charged sides. 
The filter’s area is nearly twelve times larger than that of a standard mini-HEPA filter thus, maximizing efficiency. This also gives the filter a longer life span. A single mini-electret filter can last four months, and when it is time for replacement, you simply twist the bottom off and lift the filter out. 



Plasma ionizer and Electret filter working in conjunction



While our electret film filter has proven to be highly effective in eliminating germs, viruses, bacteria, carbon monoxide, toluene, benzene, and formaldehyde, we decided to add a preparation stage that uses a plasma ionizer to be sure that we get every last bit of pollutant. As chemical molecules and other biological agents enter the charging section they collide with ions, gaining that ion’s static charge. The now charged particles pass on to the trapping section and are filtered out of your environment. 
This innovative technology was developed in collaboration with the Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology, the Korea Institute of Industrial Technology and Pusan University through the support of the Ministry of Science, ICT & Future Planning.







Clair B’s attractive design fits with any décor. With its basic two-toned design, Clair B is elegant in its simplicity thereby matching the aesthetic of any environment in which it is placed. Simple, Classic and Portable. That was the emphasis of Clair B's design. 
For the design elements we collaborated with The Korean Institute of Design Promotion. The process was highly iterative with multiple conceptualizations, re-designs and testing before deciding upon a final design.",20.0,1,"4 Campaigns

What is it?The latest, simplest, most hygienic way to get your back & body healthy, wealthy, and clean.Neglecting Your Back and the Hidden DangersMost
 people tend to have a little trouble reaching their back when the time 
comes to take a shower, so we end up skipping over, giving our backs the 
thorough scrubbing they deserve. After all, our backs don't tend to get 
as filthy on an average day as many other parts of our bodies do. So 
what's the harm?Well,
 here's a dirty little secret about showers. The running water actually

<h3>UPDATE: We're having a boy!!!!! Little Jude Thomas Williams is perfectly healthy at 22 weeks, and the doctor guesses he will be as tall as his daddy. We did have a little scare during the first ultrasound; the technicians thought they were seeing signs of a placental abruption (the placenta detaching). So we immediately got a higher-resolution ultrasound that, thankfully, let us know that there was nothing to worry about. Better tech meant bigger bucks, though--around $720 cash for this first one and then again at about 32 weeks. So we are more grateful than ever for everyone's help, love, and support. Happy 2012!</h3>
<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>We're Nick and Delondra, and we're having our first baby! After almost eight years of marriage and ten years of being in love, we are so excited for the newest member of our little family to arrive on May 13, 2012. But we need help. Although we both work a lot--Delondra as a writer and LAUSD teacher, and Nick as an actor--we do not have health insurance. The insurance we had through the school was cancelled due to budget cuts. We don't qualify for assistance from the state of California, because we make too much money. But we don't make <span style=""font-style: italic;"">enough</span> money to pay both the monthly rates and deductibles on the individual insurance plans we <span style=""font-style: italic;"">do</span> qualify for. So, we're paying for prenatal care and the birth itself on our own. </p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The entire package through our birthing center will cost $7,000. And that's if everything goes according to plan. It 
includes some in-center tests, birthing classes, prenatal check-ups, and
 the birth itself at the center. However, that 
doesn't include prenatal vitamins, additional OB tests, maternity 
clothing, or the emergency
 health insurance we will have to pay for in the next few months in case
 Delondra has to go to the hospital during the birth. The entire
 $7,000 has to be paid by the due date, or else...we can't give birth 
there. <br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>When we first heard all the various fees and saw how limited our options were, Delondra cried. We weren't sure how to afford what we believe to be the best care for our child--with the midwives at the birthing center. And every time they tell us about a new test that wasn't on the original budget, we worry that we'll have to skip doing something important, like testing for Down Syndrome (just <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">one</span> of the three tests costs $500), because we just don't have the money. <br/></p>
<p></p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>Our goal is to raise $4,000 to help with the cost of the baby. <br/><br/>Currently, we're paying $350 to the birthing center itself every month. In March, we will put the remainder of the total bill on a healthcare credit card that has zero interest for the first six months. We don't have any current debt, so we're not afraid to take on a little for the baby. He or she is obviously worth it! But we could use some help. <br/><br/>Although we'd be ecstatic to reach $4,000 through your generosity, we'd be grateful for any little bit below that. It all goes directly to the baby. We already have ourselves and the initial birthing center payments budgeted out and under control. We are all about finding cheap, creative ways to make our family healthy and happy. We've been doing it for years! But even $150 more would buy Delondra a bottle of the vitamins our midwife wants us to use that, right now, we just can't afford.<br/><br/>Here are some examples of where your donations will go:<br/><br/>Prenatal visits.............$175 each (12 total)<br/>Postpartum visits.......$175 each (3 total)<br/>Birth kit......................$125<br/>Labor/Delivery...........$2,950<br/>In-labor monitoring....$380<br/>Classes.....................$350<br/>OB visit.....................$150<br/>Lab-work...................$300 - $600<br/>Sonograms...............$500<br/>Down Testing...........$550<br/>Vitamins....................$400<br/><br/><h3 style=""font-weight: bold;"">Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We know that times are tough for everyone. We're all tightening our belts and worrying about how we're going to make it month-by-month. But any little donation would really help. And, if you can't donate, please spread the word and/or pass along gently-used baby supplies and maternity clothing! Thank you for reading! We appreciate any help that may come our way.<br/></p>

</div><p><span>My name is John Symons. I’ve done many things in my life - I have been a middle school art teacher, managed several restaurants, and I ran my own produce company. But now I want to do something more important: save lives.</span></p><p>Around 20 years ago, I first learned about phage therapy. I saw a BBC program that explained how phage therapy could cure bacterial diseases without antibiotics. They stated that this safe and effective cure would never come to the United States because drug companies could not  make money on it, since it could not be patented.</p><p>Yet, antibiotic-resistant bacteria are now an imminent threat. Scientists expect the first completely drug-resistant strain to occur within the next few years. Without a way to combat these threats, we will return to the pre-antibiotic era, with thousands and even millions dying due to common infections. What can we do?</p><p>First, my goal is to start a non-profit corporation to finance drug trials of different phage therapy cures. Though much research exists and phage therapy is even in use in three countries, studies must be done to gain U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval before phage therapy could be implemented in the United States.</p><p>Second, the non-profit would encourage our government to spend money on phage therapy. The United Kingdom has already had phase I and phase II  trials on one phage therapy cure. The U.S. is falling behind. </p><p>Third, we would start an educational program to prevent people from getting bacterial diseases in the first places. Many simple measures could make a big difference, such as educating doctors to disinfect their stethoscopes between patients, educating hospital staff to wash their privacy curtains between patients, and educating children on the proper way to wash their hands.

I’ve done many things in my life - I have been a middle school art teacher, managed several restaurants, and I ran my own produce company. But now I want to do something more important: save lives.Around 20 years ago, I first learned about phage therapy. I saw a BBC program that explained how phage therapy could cure bacterial diseases without antibiotics. They stated that this safe and effective cure would never come to the United States because drug companies could not  make money on it, since it could not be patented.Yet, antibiotic-resistant bacteria are now an imminent threat. Scientists expect the first completely drug-resistant strain to occur within the next few years. Without a way to combat these threats, we will return to the pre-antibiotic era, with thousands and even millions dying due to common infections. What can we do?First, my goal is to start a non-profit corporation to finance drug trials of different phage therapy cures. Though much research exists and phage therapy is even in use in three countries, studies must be done to gain U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval before phage therapy could be implemented in the United States.Second, the non-profit would encourage our government to spend money on phage therapy. The United Kingdom has already had phase I and phase II  trials on one phage therapy cure. The U.S. is falling behind. Third, we would start an educational program to prevent people from getting bacterial diseases in the first places. Many simple measures could make a big difference, such as educating doctors to disinfect their stethoscopes between patients, educating hospital staff to wash their privacy curtains between patients, and educating children on the proper way to wash their hands. (In a recent study, a whopping 68% of Americans did not wash their hands properly.)Now that my children are grown and I am retired, I have the time to devote to this project. I have been studying phage therapy, bacterial diseases, and fund-raising for the last year, and I’m ready to bring experts on board once the non-profit is funded and formed. My goal is for the non-profit to be raising at least 5 million dollars a year within 5 years.Raising 5 million dollars a year is not easy, but I have family that works in the non-profit field, so I have knowledge about what is involved in fundraising and resources to turn to for advice and support.

It's a place where we go not only to make some smashing tackles (like Lawes vs France) but where we go to have fun, cheer on our sides from touch, to minis, to men's......you name it we do it. Our club and our members are important and that is why we want to get the funds to keep them safe in times of crisis with a defibrillator.HOWEVER ...... Why stop there??? Rugby is about community and we want to raise enough money to get our club and two more clubs  in the local area defibrillators. The ideal plan would for all Dorset and Wilts rugby clubs in the area to have one....so any extra money we make we will be extending this to more and more clubs.So on 18th April 2015 Oaks Ladies, at their beloved club Oakmeadians RFC, will be raising their heart beats by continually riding two static bikes for twelve hours. Please donate what you can......every penny counts. This is not just for our club but for our rugby community.THANK YOU",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

I am creating The Body Exchange Home Fitness Collection because fitness should be accessible, safe and fun for every, single, body - period.  Everyone has the right to endorphins but this is the reality:

In general, the plus size community is marginalized as consumers and grossly overlooked in health and fitness programs that fit their needs. Yet, society screams at us to get moving and live up to a certain look and health ideal without optimal programs available.  It's lose/lose and we aren't getting anywhere with this model.  The plus size community deserves empowerment, cutting edge fitness programs, inclusion and the right to draw their own conclusion on what health means to them.

I'd like to introduce a new paradigm for fitness for the plus size community and I'd like to invite you to join our our ""movement"" of fearless fitness, at any size. 


ABOUT ME

My name is Louise Green and in 2008 I Founded my business Body Exchange; fearless fitness dedicated to the plus size demographic.  I was tired of seeing the plus size community underserved and struggling to keep up in mainstream fitness programs that were uninviting.  Since opening my business we have trained and interacted with thousands of plus size women.  My drive to pioneer this concept came from my personal experiences navigating the fitness industry as a Personal Trainer and participant, plus size.  Through thousands of hours I have mastered what works and what doesn't work with this group both physically and mentally and I've brought that expertise to a home fitness video, accessible to every ""body"".  I am certified in Group Fitness, Weight Training and Personal Training and I can confidently say:  I am unequivocally a fitness expert to the plus size community.  I know that consistency in exercise lies within feeling successful, included and represented. These key ingredients are the foundation to my new fitness video: The Body Exchange Home Fitness Collection.


WHY IS THIS IMPORTANT?
There are 220 million overweight North Americans and there is no shortage of prominent, negative, headlines calling this a ""crisis"".  However, it's my strong belief that the crisis doesn't lie in the weight of North Americans but rather, in the way we respond to this demographics need's.  Often people don't exercise because they don't know where to start or they have limitations that discount them from mainstream fitness programs or their barriers of fear and intimidation are just too much.  This home fitness video addresses all of these issues head on.  This fitness video works for every ""body"" even if you are starting in a chair.  
Please, help us help more people!

WHY AM I HEADING THIS PROJECT?

I decided to produce The Body Exchange Home Fitness Collection because I've consistently heard from people, from all over the world, say that they would like a Body Exchange program in their community.  At speaking events, I often hear frustration (and tears) from audience members saying that they feel judged or intimidated when approaching the gym setting.  Their voices echo what I already know.  For many people fitness is simply unapproachable, unattainable and uninviting and it prevents them from experiencing the endless benefits that exercise can bring.  

At Body Exchange and through this DVD we approach health and fitness from a body positive position and encourage sweating for the love of moving our bodies and living a healthy lifestyle, period.  There is no hidden agenda to ""Get Flat Abs in 21 Days"" or to ""Eliminate that Muffin Top"" as seen on every news stand, these slogans move against our Body Exchange culture.  I understand that we all have our own journey with our bodies and that movement, at any size, has endless benefits to your health.

Through this medium we also add to the fitness landscape a visual representation of the plus size women working out which we seldom see in any videos, advertising, or television.  With The Body Exchange Home Fitness Collection you will see yourself and that is powerful!


HOW YOUR CONTRIBUTION WILL IMPACT THE WORLD!
By contributing to this fitness video you will be helping us change the paradigm of fitness for North Americans and in the big picture, that is a big, huge, deal.  In many circumstances our Western Culture puts pressure on the plus size demographic to move their bodies and lose weight without many options that support a long term lifestyle plan.  Diets don't work and while the diet industry continues to make billions of dollars while failing millions of people, we believe that moving your body and celebrating who you are opens the door to endless possibility.  This video will get people started and empower them; and just like our proven Body Exchange programs, it will change people's lives.  The Body Exchange's mission has been a clear path since 2008 to change perceptions, attitudes and lives through fearless fitness, at any size.  By backing our cause you will be helping us drive that message and change the world.  
We are on a mission to raise $4800.00 to produce this revolutionary fitness video. The funds will go to:  
Studio rentals,  Lighting, filming, editing, makeup, uniforms, graphic design, insurance, web development, a small compensation to our crew and DVD production.  If we don't raise the full amount through this campaign we plan to put the funds towards production and will continue to try to raise funds through other avenues to cover the rest of our expenses.   I was raised ""old school"" and I am not someone who is accustomed to asking for money so I've the added perks that are valuable and worthy of your hard earned money.  We have some amazing perks that support fearless fitness at any size, check them out!
Risks & Challenges
 Although my professional history has a great track record this is the first time I've produced a fitness DVD.  We have the filming under our belt but the risks and challenges I foresee is that our team is having to work out the kinks as we go. We've very successful to this point and I know we can overcome these challenges because of the amazing team I work with.  
Another challenge is: often the media doesn't understand ""fearless fitness at any size"".  This can make marketing and publicity opportunities more challenging.  Throughout my career I've found creative ways to reach my audience and will continue leverage as much exposure as possible in the right places.

</div><div style=""text-align: center;"">
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Located in the beautiful Pojoaque Valley north of Santa Fe, New Mexico, Equest Counseling Center was founded and established in 2003 from the hopes and dreams of Dr. Katrina Lujan, Ph.D. to create a progressive culturally sensitive and aware counseling center providing mental health services to the culturally varied and richly diverse communities of Northern New Mexico. </p>

<p><em><em><em><em><strong>"" There is something about the outside of a horse that is good for the inside of a man""  --Winston Churchill</strong></em></em></em></em></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">
</p>
<p>I was out on my own at 16 years old and I had my children at
a very young age and devoted my early adulthood to raising my children. I
somehow endured many years of very challenging experiences but instead of
feeling sorry for myself I felt as if I could use all of the challenging
experiences of my life and help others. As I knew that I wanted to give back I first
returned to school I had to begin with procuring my GED as I never had finished
high school. Then I proceeded to complete my BA, MA and was able to obtain my Ph.D.
over a 22 year span. Wow, as I look back at how I was able to take good care of
my children, build several successful small businesses and stay focused on
school I was so excited to finally complete my educational pursuits. I do feel
very blessed that I was fortunate enough to know that seeking an education could
change my whole life as I set out to help others to help them to re-build their
lives. </p>
<p>It was back when I had just received my first degree, my BA
in Psychology that I was given a job called Family Preservation. This entailed
me going out into the communities of Northern New Mexico and going into people’s
homes. When you go directly into your client’s homes…it is an eye opening
experience. There’s not much they can hide from you so I was able to fully see
the desperation of the living situations, the effects of extreme poverty, the
reality of the epidemic drug use in Northern New Mexico. </p>

<p>It was during this introductory job in the field of mental
health when I came to realize that there just weren’t any great counseling
centers available to people who truly needed to seek out services for mental
health issues…then I envisioned building the most beautiful and inviting center
that I could imagine. </p>

It was this job that
had a lot to do with my choice, my decision and my goal of building a unique,
peaceful place of refuge that could provide creative counseling services to all
ages. I actually had a vision of exactly how I wanted the ranch to look like…so
I began to draw out the layout of the actual ranch where the horses could run, where
every view is absolutely stunning, where I wanted the actual counseling center to
face the beautiful Sangre De Cristo Mountains creating the comfort and feel of
a serene and calming ranch house to make it more inviting to those who come to
us for healing.

people reading our campaign could understand that if we were to close down due

Located in the beautiful Pojoaque Valley north of Santa Fe, New Mexico, Equest Counseling Center was founded and established in 2003 from the hopes and dreams of Dr. Katrina Lujan, Ph.D. to create a progressive culturally sensitive and aware counseling center providing mental health services to the culturally varied and richly diverse communities of Northern New Mexico. 

"" There is something about the outside of a horse that is good for the inside of a man""  --Winston Churchill


I was out on my own at 16 years old and I had my children at
a very young age and devoted my early adulthood to raising my children. I
somehow endured many years of very challenging experiences but instead of
feeling sorry for myself I felt as if I could use all of the challenging
experiences of my life and help others. As I knew that I wanted to give back I first
returned to school I had to begin with procuring my GED as I never had finished
high school. Then I proceeded to complete my BA, MA and was able to obtain my Ph.D.
over a 22 year span. Wow, as I look back at how I was able to take good care of
my children, build several successful small businesses and stay focused on
school I was so excited to finally complete my educational pursuits. I do feel
very blessed that I was fortunate enough to know that seeking an education could
change my whole life as I set out to help others to help them to re-build their
lives. 
It was back when I had just received my first degree, my BA
in Psychology that I was given a job called Family Preservation. This entailed
me going out into the communities of Northern New Mexico and going into people’s
homes. When you go directly into your client’s homes…it is an eye opening
experience. There’s not much they can hide from you so I was able to fully see
the desperation of the living situations, the effects of extreme poverty, the
reality of the epidemic drug use in Northern New Mexico. 

It was during this introductory job in the field of mental
health when I came to realize that there just weren’t any great counseling
centers available to people who truly needed to seek out services for mental
health issues…then I envisioned building the most beautiful and inviting center
that I could imagine.

Since then, we have been dedicated to helping people work smarter. The SmartDesk now helps over 300,000 customers across the globe to be healthier, happier and more productive at work.

<p>Now we’ve decided to conquer the fitness industry. Why?

If you want to boost your brain function, energy, and mood, frequent exercise is a must. We understand that stimulating connections between different areas of the brain and getting oxygen pumping through exercise, is something that lasts long after you’ve finished your workout. We want all our customers to experience next level energy, productivity, and happiness.</p>

Die Arbeit ist dann nicht nur während der Ausstellung zu sehen. Die Zeitung kann mitgenommen werden und überdauert somit die Dauer der Ausstellung.
Auf der rechten Seite kannst du sehen wie du mir helfen kannst. Deine Unterstützung wird natürlich auch nicht umsonst sein.
Dabei geht es bereits ab 5€ los. Für 18€ bekommst du dann die Zeitung. Echte Prints auf Fotopapier gibt es in verschiedenen Größen und Auflagen ab 50€. 
Sollten wir das Ziel nicht erreichen, so kann ich das Geld trotzdem für eine kleinere Auflage benutzen. Die fehlenden Exemplare drucke ich dann nach, sobald ich kann.

  Die Folgen Mit deiner Spende unterstützt du natürlich nicht nur die Produktion der Zeitung. Du ermöglichst mir darüber hinaus einige Exemplare zu drucken, welche ich dann an verschiedene Plattformen verschicke, um mein Projekt noch bekannter zu machen. 
Darüber hinaus unterstützt du junge Fotografie in Deutschland und zeigst, dass es eine Plattform dafür gibt. 
Andere Wege, wie man helfen kann
 Wenn du nichts spenden kannst..macht nichts! Vielleicht kannst du ja helfen meine Idee etwas bekannter zu machen. Damit trägst du zu seiner Verbreitung bei und findest vielleicht dadurch jemanden der spenden kann. Du darfst das Projekt dann auch gerne im digitalen auf Facebook teilen und in der echten Welt darüber reden.

 Das war es auch schon. Ich freue mich auf deine Unterstützung und hoffe wir können das Ziel erreichen!English VersionShort descriptionFor my bachelor degree in photography I had been taking pictures in London and Frankfurt. The finished work is a newsprint with 40 pages and 27 images. The work deals with the relationship between such fixed places and their development into placeless spaces. The city has dissolved from its physical space and expanded into virtuality.
What you give and what you get
To produce a first edition of 50 I am going to need your help. The achieved sum gives me the possibility to produce the newsprint in a small edition and to present it at my thesis exhibition in october. This way the work will outlast the exhibition and therefore be available to more people. 
Of course there are some perks for you. Starting with 5€ you will get a postcard. For 18€ you will get the newsprint and if you prefer a real photographic print you can get prints in various sizes starting with 50€. These prints are limited.

In case that we should not achieve the final sum I am going to invest into a smaller edition. Missing copies will then be reprinted.
Other ways to help out
If you aren't able to help me out with money..don´t worry. You can still help me by sharing the link to my project via social media and by talking about it in real - life! 
That´s it! I am looking forward to your help!
If you got any questions open don´t hesitate to contact me and I will be glad to answer them as soon as possible.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>How to Use the Cards</h3>
<p>The cards are pretty basic. Figure out the issue you want to tap through using EFT and then draw a card for what block to tap through. Ignore the chakra features unless you are specifically asking what chakra to work with. See the testimonial below for how an EFT practitioner used the first edition of the deck (the original deck was smaller and more simple, without rounded edges).</p>

Dr. Lathrop has been successfully treating people with paralysis for nearly 20 years.  His treatment system is demonstrating breakthrough results for the people he serves.  Until now, we have only been able to treat one or two people at a time - it is time to harness this knowledge and expand it to a larger population. <b>You can help!</b><br/><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/178413/files/20131105181731-indiegogo.png?1383704251"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p><b>Yes, we want you to help us with two clear paths.  It is SIMPLE really and takes into account the desires of most who hear about our work.  </b></p><p>1.  Study the process, examine the data, determine if it tells a compelling story.</p><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">2.  Offer the treatment now to those who don't want to wait.  It is available.  </span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""><b>1.

<p></p><p></p></div>","Today, 5,596,000 Americans are living with paralysis; that's nearly 1 in 50 people.  Almost 1.3 million of those are spinal cord injured and there are 12,000 new cases every year.Being paralyzed wreaks havoc on a person's life.  Imagine one day you're living your life on your terms and the next day you can't move, can't feel your legs, maybe you can't breathe on your own.  Think of all the things that must run through this person's mind: ""I'll never chase my kids around the yard again,"" ""I'll never take that trip I always dreamed of,"" ""I'll be alone the rest of my life, no one will ever want me.""It is time for all of us to realize that this does not have to be true.  As the Christopher & Dana Reeve Foundation tell us: ""Scientists and researchers know this isn't true.""Having believed and known for many years that the body can regenerate after injury and trauma, including spinal cord injury, this project takes Dr. Peter Lathrop's years of experience acting on that knowing forward. Dr. Lathrop has been successfully treating people with paralysis for nearly 20 years.  His treatment system is demonstrating breakthrough results for the people he serves.  Until now, we have only been able to treat one or two people at a time - it is time to harness this knowledge and expand it to a larger population. You can help!Yes, we want you to help us with two clear paths.  It is SIMPLE really and takes into account the desires of most who hear about our work.  1.  Study the process, examine the data, determine if it tells a compelling story.2.  Offer the treatment now to those who don't want to wait.  It is available.  1. Clinical Study ExecutionOur work, 
until now, has been to develop best practices for employing this 
treatment protocol. We feel that now is the time to broaden our 
research, formally document our results and engage the larger medical community.The system Dr. Lathrop has developed is compromised of treatment with state of the art, FDA cleared electromedicine devices in combination with neuro-psychology therapies, neuromuscular rehabilitation,  including neural - patterning, as well as cleansing/alkalizing the body.  It is a whole person approach.  The system is based on a deep understanding of neurophysiology, neuro-psychology and the mind-body connection.Until now, we have gathered only qualitative research, like Keith's story. A formalized clinical study will provide the quantitative data necessary to expand the treatment protocol to other practitioners and restore mobility to many, many more people.2. Treating People NowDue to the 
nature of their injuries, many people suffering from paralysis and nerve
 damage are tapped out financially. Your support will help us create a fund to provide supplemental financial assistance for the treatment to those that qualify.As we treat people now we are also developing the curriculum to teach delivery of the treatment system to others. It is important to ""duplicate"" Dr. Lathrop's efforts, in order to give more people access.  We have our first practitioner in training already.  If you know of health care practitioners who would be interested and qualified share this project with them.  Won't you join us?  Here are some ways to get involved:

<h3>Who is Destiny Nickelsen?</h3>
Destiny Nickelsen is a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosplay"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">cosplayer.</a><p></p>
<p>She is a beautiful young girl with a passion for creativitity, using costume creation and modeling as her outlet. Her family has a history of cancer.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>This past week, Destiny learned that she has cancer in a mole on her back. Melanoma, the most dangerous form of skin cancer. According to the World Health Organization, melanoma causes approximately 48,000 deaths worldwide per year. We don't want to add to that statistic.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Melanoma is the most serious type of skin cancer due to its tendency to spread (or metastasize) to lymph nodes and other areas of the body, as compared to the other types of skin cancer.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
</p>
<h3>Destiny Needs Help.</h3>
<div>
<strong>Destiny is not covered by health insurance.</strong> This situation compromises her future in a big way. To treat melanoma, she will need to undergo surgery and radiation treatment, and possibily chemotherapy.<p></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Destiny's cancer may already be in the stage II phase. She will soon undergo a biopsy to check depth, and we'll hope for the best. This page will be updated continually, you will know as soon as we know.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>This girl works hard. Destiny's income is supplemented by selling cosplay prints in her <a href=""http://destinynickelsen.storenvy.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">online store.</a> But without insurance, medical bills are astronomical. Her current estimated treatment costs are $5,000, but they may end up higher. All funds donated to the campaign will go directly to Destiny's bank account.</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<h3><strong>What You Get:</strong></h3>
<p><br/>We're going to bet that you know someone who has been affected by cancer. Maybe it's you. Maybe it's your family. If you know Destiny, it's her.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>If you're a fellow ""geek"" or cosplayer and found yourself in her situation, you would probably welcome a group of supporters willing to help fund your treatment. Positivity and laughter affect the healing process in a big, big way.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Since this is a financial crisis, Destiny doesn't have much to give - tangibly, anyway. She has prints from her cosplay store and can post YouTube videos expressing her personal thanks for your donation.</p>
<p>

<p>7/23: Huge thanks to all who have donated and shared the page! I have passed all of your private comments on to Destiny and she couldn't be more grateful.</p>
<p>7/23: Destiny has a doctor's appointment (including a full screening to check for other spots) on Monday. I'll update this page afterwards. :) I'm amazed at how quickly this has grown! Thank you.</p>
<p>7/24: Woke up this morning to see that we beat the goal! I am astounded by how quickly people came together for this. Thank you SO much! <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/OfficialDestinyNickelsen/posts/615243888495918"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Here's a post from Destiny </a>regarding upcoming conventions and leftover funds. I'll continue to update this page as we hear more. Not sure what the final bills will be, and we have our fingers crossed for Monday's appointment. Hopefully the moles can be easily removed.</p>
<p><br/>7/29: Destiny went to the doctor today. She will have the full body scan results later this week, but the mole removal will happen next week! :)</p>

Destiny Nickelsen is a cosplayer.
She is a beautiful young girl with a passion for creativitity, using costume creation and modeling as her outlet. Her family has a history of cancer.
 
This past week, Destiny learned that she has cancer in a mole on her back. Melanoma, the most dangerous form of skin cancer. According to the World Health Organization, melanoma causes approximately 48,000 deaths worldwide per year. We don't want to add to that statistic.
 
Melanoma is the most serious type of skin cancer due to its tendency to spread (or metastasize) to lymph nodes and other areas of the body, as compared to the other types of skin cancer.
 


Destiny Needs Help.

Destiny is not covered by health insurance. This situation compromises her future in a big way. To treat melanoma, she will need to undergo surgery and radiation treatment, and possibily chemotherapy.
 
Destiny's cancer may already be in the stage II phase. She will soon undergo a biopsy to check depth, and we'll hope for the best. This page will be updated continually, you will know as soon as we know.
 
This girl works hard. Destiny's income is supplemented by selling cosplay prints in her online store. But without insurance, medical bills are astronomical. Her current estimated treatment costs are $5,000, but they may end up higher. All funds donated to the campaign will go directly to Destiny's bank account.
 

What You Get:
We're going to bet that you know someone who has been affected by cancer. Maybe it's you. Maybe it's your family. If you know Destiny, it's her.
 
If you're a fellow ""geek"" or cosplayer and found yourself in her situation, you would probably welcome a group of supporters willing to help fund your treatment. Positivity and laughter affect the healing process in a big, big way.
 
Since this is a financial crisis, Destiny doesn't have much to give - tangibly, anyway. She has prints from her cosplay store and can post YouTube videos expressing her personal thanks for your donation.

7/23: Huge thanks to all who have donated and shared the page! I have passed all of your private comments on to Destiny and she couldn't be more grateful.
7/23: Destiny has a doctor's appointment (including a full screening to check for other spots) on Monday. I'll update this page afterwards. :) I'm amazed at how quickly this has grown! Thank you.
7/24: Woke up this morning to see that we beat the goal! I am astounded by how quickly people came together for this. Thank you SO much! Here's a post from Destiny regarding upcoming conventions and leftover funds. I'll continue to update this page as we hear more. Not sure what the final bills will be, and we have our fingers crossed for Monday's appointment. Hopefully the moles can be easily removed.
7/29: Destiny went to the doctor today. She will have the full body scan results later this week, but the mole removal will happen next week! :)

Our World Needs Kuli Kuli
There are millions of health-conscious people looking for natural ways to nourish their busy lifestyles, just as there are a billion people seeking nourishment to survive. We’re connecting these two groups through moringa. Moringa is a powerful tool in the fight against malnutrition because it requires little water and flourishes in harsh climates. We’re working with women’s cooperatives in West Africa to grow more moringa for their communities and create economic opportunity. We’re bringing this West African grown moringa to the United States in the form of delicious, raw* and gluten-free Kuli Kuli Bars.

<p><b>EXACTLY
HOW YOUR SUPPORT WILL HELP COMPLETE OUR MISSION.</b></p>
<p>To date, Plaque Ops development has been funded by Emily, Bill, and Emily's
awesome Uncle Robert.  With very lean financing, we have stretched each
dollar and worked diligently for 3 years to complete the R&amp;D, patent the unique
formula, and finalize the product development.</p>
<p>We would love to have you along for this next phase!  Your support will
enable us to manufacture our first 2,000 bottles of mints (1 bottle = a
one-month supply), pH strips to measure mouth acid levels and final product
testing.</p>
<br/><p><u>Total
budget*: $27,500</u></p>
<p>Bulk Ingredients, Manufacturing, Labeling and Packaging: $19,600</p>
<p>Shipping: $1,100</p>
<p>Product Testing: $3,500</p>
<p>Customer Feedback System:
$1,300</p>
<p>Operations: $2,000</p>
<p>*We are extremely lean and
have to pay for only a few consultants’ time (e.g., web designers, PR and
legal), many of whom have significantly reduced their fees because they believe
in Plaque Ops.  The core team is so dedicated that we are working <i>gratis.
</i> Therefore, almost every penny will go into making this revolutionary
product.</p>
<p>In the event we do not
raise all that we hope to, your contribution will be put towards the
manufacture of Plaque Ops tablets.  The goal is to get product to those of
us who need it most.  We have a great relationship with our U.S.-based
licensed cGMP manufacturer who will let us scale back our order, if we need to.</p>

hundreds or thousands of dollars every time you or a loved one go to the dentist.  Imagine a life with less cavities, root canals, or periodontal disease.  What about a life with a lower risk of heart attack, stroke, Alzheimer's disease or cancer?  






You hold the power to help turn these into reality.Your support will enable us
to provide you with a set of products that will help you personalize your
lifestyle in a manner that promotes you and your loved one's health. ***We really care about you
and your loved ones, that is why we founded the company and are launching
Plaque Ops.  In the weeks to come, you will
hear our stories describing why we joined the Plaque Ops Mission Possible.  It is not just our story that matters.  We want
to hear your story -- why are you supporting this Mission?  If you are interested in sending us your story, which we hope
you are, please go to:http://plaque-ops.com/share-your-story

EXACTLY
HOW YOUR SUPPORT WILL HELP COMPLETE OUR MISSION.
To date, Plaque Ops development has been funded by Emily, Bill, and Emily's
awesome Uncle Robert.  With very lean financing, we have stretched each
dollar and worked diligently for 3 years to complete the R&D, patent the unique
formula, and finalize the product development.
We would love to have you along for this next phase!  Your support will
enable us to manufacture our first 2,000 bottles of mints (1 bottle = a
one-month supply), pH strips to measure mouth acid levels and final product
testing.
Total
budget*: $27,500
Bulk Ingredients, Manufacturing, Labeling and Packaging: $19,600
Shipping: $1,100
Product Testing: $3,500
Customer Feedback System:
$1,300
Operations: $2,000
*We are extremely lean and
have to pay for only a few consultants’ time (e.g., web designers, PR and
legal), many of whom have significantly reduced their fees because they believe
in Plaque Ops.  The core team is so dedicated that we are working gratis.
 Therefore, almost every penny will go into making this revolutionary
product.
In the event we do not
raise all that we hope to, your contribution will be put towards the
manufacture of Plaque Ops tablets.  The goal is to get product to those of
us who need it most.  We have a great relationship with our U.S.-based
licensed cGMP manufacturer who will let us scale back our order, if we need to.

Jeremy is one of the most thoughtful and caring men I know. His sense of humor and kindness is unmatched by anyone I have ever known. U<span class=""vk_ans vk_bk"">nfortunately, he may never be the same after his brush with death following an explosion by a malfunctioning firework, and now he needs our help. </span>
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>My name is Justin Durham, and I was working with Jeremy the day he was injured. I have performed large firework shows in the past and I have never seen anything like what happened on the 4th of July 2013 in Kingman AZ. Directly after Jeremy was injured I rushed to is side and administered aid to him until rescue workers arrived. I stayed by Jeremy’s side until he was loaded into the ambulance and rushed to the hospital. The reason I want to raise money for Jeremy is because it is more than a miracle that he survived the explosion that has forever changed his life. Jeremy is still listed in critical condition and there are many questions still unanswered about the extent of Jeremy’s permanent injuries. What is known is that his life will never be the same. Because of this uncertainty it is unknown when or if Jeremy will ever be able to go to work again. Jeremy, like all of us, has bills to pay, and I want to take away the stress from him and his family of paying those bills so they can focus on recovery. If you help Jeremy you will be helping one of the greatest men I have ever met in my life. You will allow him to worry about nothing but recovering from his injuries and returning back to his life as fast as possible.</div>

<h2>What We Need &amp; What You Get<span style=""font-size: 10px;""> </span>
</h2>
<p>While visiting Jeremy’s family in the hospital his mother expressed concerns of how his bills for regular debt will be paid. This concern is what I am trying to address with this campaign. In order to not make his family feel uncomfortable I did not ask what Jeremy’s specific amount of debt is so I am just guessing but I suspect we will need:</p>
<ul>
<li>$5000 or more to cover his bills</li>
<li>All of this money will go straight to Jeremy and his family whether we reach our goal or not.(except fees from this site and any expenses spent raising donations i.e. printing, postage, events etc.)</li>
<li>Of course there are perks involved for your donations, I am not a wealthy man but I will give you personalized tokens of appreciation for your donations</li>
</ul>
<h2>The Impact</h2>
<p> Jeremy may not ever truly know how much people care for him and how much people have joined together to help him, but his family, you and I will know. You will relieve the pressure and burdens placed on Jeremy’s family to contact bill collectors and try to pay his debt. You will be an angel who helped his mother stay by his side during his recovery. You will be able to track his progress through video postings to my youtube channel where I will talk with family members and show all the help you gave to Jeremy and his family. </p>
<h2>Other Ways You Can Help</h2>

<h3>Hell and Back- David Clark's Badwater Journey</h3>
<p>The Badwater 135 is known as the toughest footrace on the planet. Thousands of the worlds greatest athletes apply every year for the chance to come test themselves in the extreme heat of Death Valley for this 135 mile run. The race starts at the Badwater Basin (283ft below sea level) and ends at The MT Whitney Portal at over 8,000ft. Only 35 ""rookie runners"" are invited each year, this year Badwater will feature a very unlikely athlete...</p>
<p>David Clark was once a man on the brink of death. He was 320lbs, alcoholic, abusing prescription pain killers, he had a heart condition, high blood pressure and two herniated discs unknown to him at the time. His daily routine consisted of vomiting blood, shaking, cold sweats, lying to all those around him and trying to figure out why his life was crumbling. Once on top of the world owning 13 retail stores by the time he was 29 he was now bankrupt clinically, emotionally and in every other sense of the word.</p>
<p>David picked himself up from the gutter and reinvented himself completely. Motivated by wanting to show his kids what a real comeback was, he decided to embrace sobriety and fitness. He has become a 160lbs accomplished endurance runner and coach finishing the Leadville 100 Mile Trail Run twice. Approaching 8 years of sobriety, David is not content to just run for glory, he has given back to the community around him. His group ""The Hero Foundation"" (formerly the Superman Project) works directly with people seeking a refuge from addiction and obesity by training them for endurance events. Members are not restricted to former addicts but also include people form all walks of life. Some who have been touched by addiction but also many who want to help prevent our youth from falling in this destructive pattern. These brave souls are marathoners and triathletes, mountain climbers and cyclists, walkers and 5k fun runners. The background of the members of the foundation are as diverse as the faces you will see at their group runs and adventures- this group calls themselves ""The Asylum""</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The cost of doing this race is considerable and we need your help to make it happen. We will be documenting this journey on film and David will be sharing his most personal thoughts as he prepares for and attempts this epic race. He will discuss his training, his mental state, his own recovery and why he is motivated to help others- nothing will be held back. It is our hope that this documentary will become a book and film that will fund The Hero Foundation in its efforts to help those struggling with their own demons. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Why We Need Your Help:</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>This race is self supported, meaning the runner is completely dependent on his own crew to guide him and support him along the way. The logistics include multiple rental cars, hotel rooms for the crew along the route, air fare, food supplies and the $995 entry fee. </p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact:</h3>
 We feel we can help touch thousands of people who are in need of hope. David's story of redemption and transformation can inspire many people to take control of their own lives. Please help us to spread the encouraging vision of The Hero Foundation.</div>

<h2 style=""margin-left: 180px;"">Making a Difference for Matt</h2>
<h3>Our Story:</h3>
<p>The makers of this campaign represent the cast of the National Tour of <em>Beauty and the Beast</em>. On September 28th, 2012 a dear member of our cast, Matthew Farcher “Gaston”, was rushed to the hospital in Houston, TX. He had jaundice and was suffering from kidney failure. He was placed in the ICU while doctors administered a series of tests. Finally, Matt was diagnosed with atypical HUS (aHUS). AHUS is an ultra-rare, life-threatening, genetic blood disease that can progressively damage vital organs, leading to stroke, heart attack, kidney failure and death. Until a year ago, there was no treatment. Unable to eat, move, or even have enough energy to speak, Matt proceeded with dialysis treatments for his kidneys and was placed on a medication called Soliris. This drug was only released a year ago and is used as a therapy for this chronic disease. Because of its rarity, this drug costs $50,000/month and over $500,000/year. Matthew will have to be on this drug for the rest of his life to keep his disease at bay. Matthew is fighting for his life and it is our sincerest hope that you will donate and help us to fight with him. </p>
<p>Throughout this entire ordeal, the cast of Beauty and the Beast has continued to fight along side him, trying to raise Matt’s spirits, encourage, and support him. As a way of doing our part, we have launched this website to try and raise money to go towards medical bills, drug bills, student loans, and the cost of living for his family, who have put their lives and careers on hold to be with him. </p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>How It Started:</h3>
<p>When Matt was first diagnosed with aHUS, Matt's mother asked that the members of the cast start doing Random Acts of Kindness in Matt's name. We were inspired by her idea to spread love and positive energy to others, and we decided it was time to give back to her family. We are continuing our R.A.K. campaign and have created this website as a way for people to give back to Matt and his family! In Barbara’s words, “Let’s show God that with Matthew, so much good is happening!” This family is perserverant, positive, humble, giving, compassionate, altruistic, and ever deserving of any and all help.</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>What We Hope For:</h3>
<p>We have several hopes in this campaign: </p>
<ul>
<li>We hope to raise $25,000 and MORE by February 14th to help Matt and his family in this time of great financial need. </li>
<li>We hope to spread Matt's story to inspire hope, love, and spread positivty.</li>
<li>We hope that this campaign goes global. We want to reach out to theatre communities, families, friends, and supporters of Matt's cause around the globe.</li>

In the video above, you can see footage of me experiencing involuntary muscular spasms. And if could hear the audio of the picture-in-picture, you could also hear involuntary vocalizations.

<p>It came about through my meditation practice, and overall, it's been an extremely positive influence in my life, helping me to grow and mature in ways that I didn't really imagine possible prior to that.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it's also been very debilitating. The spasms have been so strong and draining in the last year, that I have been unable to work and bedridden, for the most part. I have been examined by a number of professionals, including an internist, a psychiatrist, a psychologist, a neuropsychologist, a bodyworker, a number of psychotherapists, and a number of spiritual teachers. They've all concluded that there's nothing wrong with me neurologically, physiologically, or psychologically, and really that I just need time to rest and let the syndrome take its course.</p>
<p>Fortunately, with time and with rest, it has been improving, and my expectation is that I will be able to work again in about a year. Unfortunately, I don't have any income right now. A year ago, I was working in a successful psychotherapy private practice, and once I'm able to work again, I hope to be able to counsel people once more.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I'm not eligible for social security, disability, or unemployment, and my family is unable to help me, which is why I'm turning to people like you for support.

<p>Sheila is a thirty nine year old single mother . She has worked the last five years as a CNA at Parkbend nursing home, providing comfort and a smile to the residents. While pursuing her interest in dance, she was awarded a scholarship to study Flamenco dance in Spain. When she returned, she danced professionally and taught classes locally. Her daughter is an energetic copy of her that loves to sing and dance.</p>
<p><strong>What Happened</strong></p>
<p>Sheila was diagnosed with an inoperable brain tumor. The tumor is located in her cerebellum on the spinal column. She is unable to work due to its affects on her mobility, strength and speech.</p>
<p>Her health insurance; with its, $200 monthly premium, $1,500 yearly deductible and $50 copay every visit, will only pay $10,000 of the $100,000 for her radiation treatments. Is there really any doubt that this country needs heath care reform?</p>
<p><strong>What She Needs</strong></p>
<p>Our funding goal of $200,000 was set to help Sheila with radiation treatments, possible chemotherapy, doctor visits, her daughter will no doubt need school clothing and supplies, Her car is in need of repairs, about $250 to $400, rent, utilities,etc.</p>
<p>It is unknown if it is the full amount that she will need to get her life back on track. Sheila will be able to receive 93% of the funds raised (after Indiegogo's fees and the credit card processing fees are subtracted).

That’s just in the United States. After exhausting all options, including chemotherapy, radiation therapy and immunotherapy, a bone marrow transplant is typically the only remaining treatment option for blood cancer patients.  But a high failure rate and an acute shortage of donors make this treatment option a challenge. Complications arise due to the body’s rejection of the transplant and often the disease returns. Moreover, almost 65% of patients who require transplant from an unrelated donor are unable to find a match.</p><p><b><b></b></b></p><h3><b><b>Our Story</b></b></h3><p></p><p>After about four years of studying hematopoietic stem cells, in 2012 Dr. Vladislav Sandler postulated that cells similar to the progenitors that gave rise to blood stem cells during mammalian development exist in adults. The data supporting this hypothesis began to accumulate. Soon it became clear that this type of cell does indeed exist in adults. Dr. Sandler called these cells Adult Hemogenic Endothelium – AHE cells. It also became clear that AHE cells could be used for regeneration of the blood system. HemoGenyx was founded in 2013 in order to translate this discovery into clinical procedure.</p><p><b><b></b></b></p><h3><b><b>The Method</b></b></h3><p></p><p>AHE cells reside in tiny blood vessels – capillaries of several organs, such as the liver and umbilical cord. We can isolate these cells with either a small liver biopsy from the patient or from the blood vessels of an umbilical cord, activate the cells, and use them for transplantation. When AHE cells are transplanted, they start making new blood stem cells that regenerate the entire blood system of the recipient. What’s more, the isolated cells are not malignant because they never accumulated mutations or chromosomal rearrangements that often cause blood cancers to begin with and can make traditional bone marrow transplants fail.</p><p>Our approach has worked in numerous animal experiments.

That’s just in the United States. After exhausting all options, including chemotherapy, radiation therapy and immunotherapy, a bone marrow transplant is typically the only remaining treatment option for blood cancer patients.  But a high failure rate and an acute shortage of donors make this treatment option a challenge. Complications arise due to the body’s rejection of the transplant and often the disease returns. Moreover, almost 65% of patients who require transplant from an unrelated donor are unable to find a match.Our StoryAfter about four years of studying hematopoietic stem cells, in 2012 Dr. Vladislav Sandler postulated that cells similar to the progenitors that gave rise to blood stem cells during mammalian development exist in adults. The data supporting this hypothesis began to accumulate. Soon it became clear that this type of cell does indeed exist in adults. Dr. Sandler called these cells Adult Hemogenic Endothelium – AHE cells. It also became clear that AHE cells could be used for regeneration of the blood system. HemoGenyx was founded in 2013 in order to translate this discovery into clinical procedure.The MethodAHE cells reside in tiny blood vessels – capillaries of several organs, such as the liver and umbilical cord. We can isolate these cells with either a small liver biopsy from the patient or from the blood vessels of an umbilical cord, activate the cells, and use them for transplantation. When AHE cells are transplanted, they start making new blood stem cells that regenerate the entire blood system of the recipient. What’s more, the isolated cells are not malignant because they never accumulated mutations or chromosomal rearrangements that often cause blood cancers to begin with and can make traditional bone marrow transplants fail.Our approach has worked in numerous animal experiments. We were able to isolate AHE cells from the liver of a mouse and use them for transplantation. First, we destroyed blood stem cells of recipient mice using radiation. Then we transplanted AHE cells and observed the regeneration of the blood system. This procedure rescued recipients from sure death due to bone marrow failure caused by the radiation.Recently, we demonstrated that human AHE cells isolated from human umbilical cords could be used for transplantation. When these cells are transplanted into immune-compromised mice with stem cells partially destroyed by chemotherapy, they regenerate the mouses’ blood systems, generating mice with a hybrid mouse-human blood system.Third Party ValidationThe technology being developed by HemoGenyx has been reviewed and enthusiastically received by an independent advisory committee comprised of recognized scientific and thought leaders drawn from the biopharmaceutical industry, the venture capital community and the Weill Cornell Medical College faculty.In 2014,Dr. Sandler received the Daedalus Award for Innovation, a grant awarded to him specifically to pursue the very AHE cell-related research and treatments that HemoGenyx is undertaking.http://weill.cornell.edu/news/news/2014/10/daedalus-fund-selects-six-projects-for-funding-in-programs-first-round.html In addition, HemoGenyx was one of 11 winning finalists in the inaugural 43North business competition, the largest such competition in the world, which attracted almost 7,000 companies from 96 countries and all 50 states.  http://www.43north.org/winnersHemoGenyx has an exclusive, worldwide, sub-licensable license to the inventions disclosed in the patent application, titled “Isolation of Post-natal Hemogenic Endothelium and Use Thereof,” made during the course of research at Cornell by Dr. Sandler.

traumatic displacement face treacherous dangers well beyond their initial catastrophic
loss. The high occurrence of opportunistic, violent and often deadly assault against people who have been torn from their homes by a disaster, whether
natural or decidedly unnatural,
is disturbingly commonplace and perpetrated primarily against women and
children. Victims of traumatic displacement have very little to no defense against the immediate menacing
threats of assault, illness and even death due to exposure while housed in standard crisis
tent shelters.<div>    <p>SadieShelter
H&amp;S, Inc, structures are harmless to the environment, extremely sturdy, water- and fireproof shelters
with a double-wall and drop-in floor design and an effective reinforced locking
door. The pouring of
insulation material, such as sand, gravel, soil or even paper, into the
double-wall design provides structural strength and the moderation of interior
temperature while subjected to extreme outside conditions.</p>
<p>SadieShelter structures <span style=""background-color: initial;"">require no tools for assembly and can be disassembled and re-used as often as desired. SadieShelter standard HomeKit structures range in size from 4'-14' square and 10' to 12' tall. Our structures will comfortably accommodate 2-12 people and link together to create even larger internal living space.</span></p>
<p>SadieShelter
H&amp;S, Inc, also offers an optional drop-in wall “Ballistic Insert” that
provides an additional 4” insulation space. As seen on our YouTube video: <a href=""http://youtu.be/6t3kC9vPySA"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://youtu.be/6t3kC9vPySA</a>, and project description, the additional protection of this “Ballistic Insert”,
prevents the permeation of small gun-propelled projectiles. </p>

</div></div>","Hello there. My name is Darla K.
Skolnekovich. I would like to introduce you to my company, “SadieShelter
HomeKits and Systems, Inc”. I created SadieShelter H&S, Inc, after returning to school to complete an engineering degree in 2010.
“The mission of SadieShelter HomeKits and Systems, Inc, is
to provide superior sturdy temporary structures that will significantly improve
conditions of security, shelter, sanitation and solace for victims of traumatic
displacement, deployed soldiers and consumers.”                             Victims of
traumatic displacement face treacherous dangers well beyond their initial catastrophic
loss. The high occurrence of opportunistic, violent and often deadly assault against people who have been torn from their homes by a disaster, whether
natural or decidedly unnatural,
is disturbingly commonplace and perpetrated primarily against women and
children. Victims of traumatic displacement have very little to no defense against the immediate menacing
threats of assault, illness and even death due to exposure while housed in standard crisis
tent shelters.    SadieShelter
H&S, Inc, structures are harmless to the environment, extremely sturdy, water- and fireproof shelters
with a double-wall and drop-in floor design and an effective reinforced locking
door. The pouring of
insulation material, such as sand, gravel, soil or even paper, into the
double-wall design provides structural strength and the moderation of interior
temperature while subjected to extreme outside conditions.
SadieShelter structures require no tools for assembly and can be disassembled and re-used as often as desired. SadieShelter standard HomeKit structures range in size from 4'-14' square and 10' to 12' tall. Our structures will comfortably accommodate 2-12 people and link together to create even larger internal living space.
SadieShelter
H&S, Inc, also offers an optional drop-in wall “Ballistic Insert” that
provides an additional 4” insulation space. As seen on our YouTube video: http://youtu.be/6t3kC9vPySA, and project description, the additional protection of this “Ballistic Insert”,
prevents the permeation of small gun-propelled projectiles. 

SadieShelter H&S, Inc, hopes to partner with large
domestic and global aid agencies to replace treated canvas tent shelters
currently distributed to victims of traumatic displacement. SadieShelter
structures can be linked together to create a larger secure internal space and
can be made permanent with the application of a stucco-like material.

The financial support acquired by this campaign will allow us to construct 180 full-size HomeKits (8 X 8 X 10) to be distributed to agents within the Red Cross and UNHCR. Our design is solid and ready for recipient scrutiny that will inform our evolution and expansion of design and scope. Our primary goal is to replace inferior chemically treated canvas and poly-composite tent shelters included in crisis survival distributions and packages.
Our structures will save lives. SadieShelter H&S, Inc, will save the vulnerable from rape and ruinous assault, as well as exposure and illness, so they might recover and regain possession of their potential. 
This issue is not a world away. According
to the study by the Internal
Displacement Monitoring Centre and the Norwegian Refugee
Council,
“Natural disasters forced 32.4 million people to flee last year (2013), with
the overwhelming majority (98 percent) due to climate- and weather-related

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hi, my name is Brian McGowan.  My wife, Deirdre, has been battling chronic illness for 28 years.  After trying every type of medicine, both traditional and alternative, and exhausting all of our financial resources, including all our savings and all our retirement funds, we are faced with one last chance to save Deirdre.  Deirdre needs a miracle and that is what we are asking for.</p>
<p>Deirdre is like the Boy-in-the-Bubble, where everyday toxins are potentially lethal to here. After trying every possible healing avenue we could find to get Deirdre well, we finally tried what people had told us for years was what we needed to do. Move to a remote island.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Deirdre's health has continued to decline as a result of the toxins that exist even here.  Deirdre is now too sick to travel back to the mainland but continues to get only sicker here on the island. The only solution is to build her a ""bubble"", a small, safe (i.e., non-toxic) structure in which she can live, which we have begun.  It is her only chance for survival and it is the only thread of hope that keeps her from giving up after such a wearying fight to get well. But now, without your help, we are in jeopardy of losing it.</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We are seeking to raise $11,111 because that amount will help us to stabilize Deirdre's condition and assess the best next steps to get her on the road to recovery. While our needs will exceed that amount, we felt the series of 'ones' represents a new start for Deirdre, which is what we are trying to achieve with this project.</p>
<p>28 years ago, Deirdre contracted Lyme disease. At the time not many knew much about it so it went undiagnosed and misdiagnosed for about 10 years.  By that time she was very sick and she was treated with massive doses of oral and intravenous antibiotics, which blew out her immune system as well as the good bacteria in her digestive system.  This was complicated by the fact that Deirdre has a very rare liver condition in which the two primary detoxification pathways and three of the five secondary pathways out of her liver don't work. So her body has an extremely limited capacity to eliminate toxins.</p>
<p>As a result, Deirdre needs to live as far away from other people as possible, which can be difficult to achieve on an island.  After a year of searching, we found a small house for rent on a piece of property that would potentially provide Deirdre some safety.  She could not tolerate living in this or any other house we have rented, however, so while we have a place to store our belongings and I can cook meals, Deirdre has had to live outside on a beach.  While this might sound like a romantic notion, this island, Kauai, can be known for rain, high winds, and cold temperatures at night, especially during the winter months.  It would be tough for a strong and well person to do for two years, but for a sick person it is unimaginable.</p>
<p>We have begun to build a ""bubble"" for Deirdre, which is to be composed of untreated lumber, glass, tile and a metal roof, which are the least reactive materials with which we can build.  When I lost my job, we ran out of money to continue building the ""bubble"" and got behind on the rent.  We are now at a place in which our landlord, who has been very patient and understanding, must now collect the three months of back rent (plus October's rent which is due very soon) or we must leave. In lieu of the unpaid rent, he will take the structure and any remaining building materials. </p>
<p>This structure is my wife's and my only hope for her survival. We are asking for your contributions so that we can catch up on our back rent and remain on the premises, to purchase the materials and the labor to finish building the structure and move Deirdre indoors for the first time in two years, and to purchase equipment which will help to detox Deirdre's body, such as a FAR infrared sauna and a soaking tub, as well as a number of other things, and to ship a special magnet bed which is being stored for us back on the mainland.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>WHAT WE CAN OFFER in appreciation of your contributions:</p>
<p>$ - Any amount: The chance to actually help save someone's life, someone who has fought unerringly for her own life for many, many years but now must rely on the help of others.  And, of course, our heartfelt and eternal gratitude.</p>
<p>$30 - A picture of Deirdre in our current situation to see how we manage to survive day by day.</p>
<p>$100 - A detailed written description of what it is like to live a day under our current circumstances, a situation we never could possibly have imagined.</p>
<p>$150 - A detailed written description of what it is like to live a day under our current circumstances, a situation we never could possibly have imagined, including my/our personal reflections and editorializing.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>THE IMPACT</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>Multiple chemical sensitivity, of which Deirdre has an extreme case, is affecting more and more people as our environments become more toxic.  Nobody really notices if the result is seemingly only an ache or pain here and there, but it is important to bring awareness to the potential severity of impact on one's health before it is too late.</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We will be incredibly grateful for any financial help we might receive, but we will also be incredibly grateful for your prayers for us, your good intentions for us in finding the help we need, any form of remote detoxification work (especially on Deirdre's liver and intestines) and any positive thoughts you might be able to hold for us, as there are times when it can be exceedingly difficult to hold them for ourselves.</p>

Our visits there range from a few nights to a few months, and everything in between!</p><p>Kiera has had many life-threatening episodes, where she would turn blue and stiff, and not respond to emergency medications.

The physical challenges I faced as a child affected my mental and emotional health as a young adult. At the age of 19 I discovered Bikram Yoga and within a year my life was transformed on all levels. By practicing yoga daily, I achieved vibrant health shedding pounds and medication.

The physical challenges I faced as a child affected my mental and emotional health as a young adult. At the age of 19 I discovered Bikram Yoga and within a year my life was transformed on all levels. By practicing yoga daily, I achieved vibrant health shedding pounds and medication. I first competed in Texas in 2005 then after years of dedication won 1st place in the 2009 National Yoga Asana Championship and placed 2nd internationally.

<h3>My name is Georgia.  I have Marfan Syndrome which causes all kinds of problems with one's body, including the heart, and the aorta, which is the largest blood vessel in our bodies.  When something goes wrong with the aorta, it can kill you.  A little over 2 years ago, I had to have part of my aorta repaired.  Now it is time to have the rest of the aorta repaired.  The drs. at Stanford Hospital couldn't fix the problem  all at once.  It was too dangerous.  My sister was here for me during my last stay in the hospital.  I need to have her with me again this time.  She is my advocate and my moral support person.  I am on some high powered medications after the surgery, so I am out of it for awhile.  She takes care of everything for me while I mostly sleep for days.  Surgery on the aorta is very traumatic to one's body, so it requires a long stay in the hospital, and a long recovery time afterwards.  It is very scary, and no one should have to go through it alone.  Here is an informative link about Stanford and Marfan Syndrome.  <a href=""http://stanfordhospital.org/clinicsmedServices/COE/heart/DiseasesConditions/marfan/?gclid=CIKI1p69wLUCFQhxQgodpC4AlQ"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://stanfordhospital.org/clinicsmedServices/COE/heart/DiseasesConditions/marfan/?gclid=CIKI1p69wLUCFQhxQgodpC4AlQ</a>

<h3>I need to raise the money my sister will need to stay close to me while she is in California.  There is a place for people who have family members in the hospital at Stanford to stay in.  It is only a couple of blocks away from the hospital, so my sister can walk there, or get a ride in the dark.  It will cost $175 for the deposit.  You can only stay there if your family member will be in the hospital for at least a week.  Then it costs $25 a day.  If you clean the room up properly before you check out, you get the deposit back at some point.  We will donate this to the social workers at Stanford who can help another family have a safe place to stay  If people can't afford to stay anywhere close to the hospital, they have to camp out in the hospital chairs at night.    My sister also needs money for food each day, and other incidentals that we don't often think of.</h3>
<h3>My sister's airplane fare has already been donated.  So far 6 people have donated, and I am sending the link to my campaign to everyone I can think of and telling them to keep the link going. My sister is a good person who will worry herself silly if she can't be with me, and I will be so lonely and scared without her by my side.  I have lost my mom, my dad, my husband, and another sister, so my one living sister,  has always been the one to take care of me.</h3>
<h3>Your contribution to my campaign will be helping one sister get another sister through a  most terrifying, and dangerous surgery.  You may have a relative of your own that you would do anything for.  Think of my sister as that relative, and help her come to Stanford.</h3>

<h3>If you are not able to donate, please pray for me, my doctors, nurses, and all the staff who will be involved in my surgery.

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Hello! We are Kansas Quidditch and at the Midwest Regionals, we qualified to move on to the next stage of competition, the World Cup! The World Cup is the premier tournament for quidditch and the end goal for all teams! Getting to that level however has been extremely taxing on our resources, we played in 5 tournaments around the Midwest and have the bruises and injuries to prove it, all the practice and preparation in tournaments leading up to our regionals placed a great deal of stress on our treasury. We have one final push to fundraise in getting to the World Cup VI and any help would be greatly appreciated! We hope to get to the World Cup and continue the winning tradition of Kansas and make an impact on the game of quidditch at a national level.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Goal</h3>
<p>We set a goal of $2000 which would supplement the travel to and from Florida and would simplify all travel and monetary constraints of the club. Any remaining funds would be placed in our account with the University of Kansas and kept safe for future club needs in the following year.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The impact of your donation would be enormous. Any donation is appreciated and will help the club tremendously. All donations can be guaranteed to go directly to the club and into our club's account at the bursar's office at KU.</p>

</p><p><b>Short Summary - #SavingRaven</b></p>
<p>Our friend, Danny Raven has always been one of the most positive and easy going people I know.  Growing up, no one had to worry about Danny.  We all knew that because he was smart, kind and hard-working that he would accomplish anything that he put his mind to.  After high school, life happened, as it tends to and we fell out of touch, but we'd run into each other from time-to-time, at the mall, at a friend's house, at a party.  We were always happy to see each other.</p>
<p>The last time I actually saw Danny, was at our friend Phillip's birthday party, where I first met his wife, Erika. It brought me joy to hear about the recent developments in Danny's life and his bright future in his career in the finance industry.  That was over 3 year ago.</p>
<p>So when I recently logged onto Facebook and saw that our mutual friend, Thomas, was throwing a garage sale to raise funds for Danny's cancer treatment, I was shocked and saddened to say the least.  It had seemed like only yesterday that Danny and I were talking and laughing 'til we cried at Phillip's house. </p>
<p>I eventually got up the nerve to text Danny and ask him about it all.  He stressed to me that the last 9 months had been pretty overwhelming.  He was proud to report that Erika was at the top of her class in her neuroscience Ph.D program at Georgetown and was working hard to support him.  He said that he'd been back here in California recently to help with his recovery, but that it was difficult being away from her.  </p><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Friends, family, neighbors and good samaritans, please help us put Danny and his family's minds at ease.  Danny's friends and family would love for him to be able to focus on his health 100% without having any financial clouds over his head.  If you know Danny, you know that he would never ask for this type of help, but you would also know that no one would appreciate your help more.  We are asking YOU, whoever you are out there, to find it in your hearth to make a donation, no matter how big or small.  And after you make YOUR donation, please forward this to 10 people in your network that you think could relate to Danny's situation.</span></p>
<p>People talk.  Word gets out.  Things add up.  </p>
<p><b>What We Need &amp; What You Get</b></p>
<p>I honestly have no idea how expensive these sorts of operations and treatments cost, but I do know that $1000 is a start.  If we could raise that amount of money, it would at least be a good starting point to help a local family in need.  </p>
<p>We can't offer you any real perks aside from your knowing that you've done your good deed for the day and that that good deed has forever influenced the lives of a young, loving and hard-working family like the Ravens. </p>

</h3>I am Sadé Tolani, the founder of My Medical eCard, along with Mayowa
Tola-Isaac, the face of My Medical eCard.<br/><br/><p>My background is medical, with further qualifications and experience
in accountancy, information technology, health informatics, teaching and
writing. I have used my skills and experience to create a simple tool that applies
technology to personal well being, accountability and control. </p>
<p>Mayowa's background is in Sports &amp; Entertainment Management. He
brings My Medical eCard to life by demonstrating the benefits of carrying one
in your wallet.</p>
<h3></h3><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/601783/files/20140524121437-MMeC_Web_I.png.png?1400958877"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><h3>What is 'My Medical eCard?</h3>My Medical eCard is a standalone, personalized, portable, electronic
medical diary. It brings all your medical activities into one simple, easily accessible, portable
device.<br/><p></p><p>My Medical eCard is a credit card shaped USB device that sits nicely
in your wallet, amongst your other cards. It goes everywhere with you.</p><p>It is made up of easy to fill medical forms that any lay person can
complete.  You can attach other documents
e.g. test results, doctors notes, dental reports, scans, x-rays, organ donor
card, medico-legal, medical billing, medical insurance documents etc on to the Medical eCard. </p><p><br/></p><p></p><h3>Why create a product like this?</h3>A lot of people want access to their medical records, but it is
proving difficult for many people in different parts of the world. <br/><p></p><p>Some organizations in some countries offer online access to some
medical records, but not all, e.g., access to GP records, but not to dental or
optical records. Hence, their medical records are incomplete at the point of access. </p>
<p>For others, the medical records are not in an orderly fashion for
ease of reference by the user, such as test results mixed up with doctors'
visits. They may not be legible and the User might not understand the medical
terminologies that have been used. </p>
<p>Also, the medical records are not accessible in the event of an
emergency, for instance, if the User is unconscious. </p>
<p>Most importantly, the User doesn't have adequate control over their
medical records. In fact, many people are not aware of the fact that they are entitled to
their medical records. All you need to do is ask your medical personnel. </p>
<p>My Medical eCard provides a simple solution to these issues, by
providing a holistic approach to managing your medical records with this simple tool. </p>
<p></p><p><br/></p><p></p><h3>How does 'My Medical eCard resolve these issues?</h3><p>My Medical eCard comprises of simple, easy to fill medical forms

can choose to save the information wherever they choose to e.g. on their home

<p>There are two medical forms:</p>
<p>A basic form made up of basic medical information e.g. Personal

<p>We want to expand our capacity to cater for corporate orders for

by encouraging and empowering Mothers to keep records of their medical

ensure that their children's immunizations are up to date. People that keep
records are in a better position to assess their health status and take action,
as needed, just like you would with your finances. </p>
<p>My Medical eCard would also like to compliment the Health Tourism

     then send for her family. She is willing to take public transportation but

a struggling mother get a ride to work.

Hi, my name is Richard Spivey and I am on a mission to

     feet after losing her job about a year ago.
My friend has been out of work for over a year. She is
     struggling to provide for her family which includes a child with a
     disability. I recently convinced her to explore job opportunities here in
     N.C. She did just that and got a job offer right away. She has orientation

     literally moving here on a wing and a prayer. She will be staying with me
     for a couple of weeks until she can get a few checks coming in and will

     I live outside of the limits and our schedules do not match up for me to
     take her everyday to work. I want to raise enough money to pay for her a
     rental car or an inexpensive used car if possible.
This is a brand new start for this struggling mother.
     She is moving on faith. She needs a fresh start and a little hope that
     things will turn around. I can only imagine what it would mean to her to
     have complete strangers give her a hand up. 

This is not a hand out. K is working
to better herself and make a new life for her family here in N.C. I'm just
hoping that someone will pay it forward.
Here
is what the money will go toward.

Any monies collected will go toward either helping to
     rent a car for a few weeks or if enough money is raised, to buy an
     inexpensive car to get K back and forth to work. Any funds left over will
     be used to help buy work clothes for her or school clothes for her kids or
     possibly to put a deposit down on an apartment.
There isn't much reward for anyone  who donates
     except to know that you have helped someone who is down on their luck have
     some hope again.
Any funds raised will go toward the purposes described
     above.

The
Impact
Your donation, big or small is not
going to change the world but it just may change one person’s life.

Give as little or as much as you can or will.
This is my first time doing this type of thing using a
     site like this.
She is a real person with real struggles. I worked with
     her previously and have known her for about 5 years.

Risks
& Challenges
 The greatest risk is that no
one will see this and or no one will respond. I can only hope that I have made
my case and that somehow together we can make a difference.

If I do not raise the funds I will still help her and
     try to work out a way to get her to work on my own.

</h3>
<p>Hi, I'm Greg. I am raising funds to cover the cost of a portable AED device. This device may be used to save my life and the life of my son. The reason this life-saving device is so important is because genetic testing has recently uncovered a genetic mutation, in both of us, that causes an abnormal heart rhythm disorder called <b>Catecholaminergic Polymorphic Ventricular Tachycardia (CPVT)</b>. If not treated immediately, the onset of this abnormal heart rhythm can lead to sudden death in as little as 10 minutes. The AED is specifically designed to treat this type of arrhythmia by shocking the heart back into a normal rhythm. Having this device nearby at all times will greatly increase our chance of survival if we were to experience VT.</p>

</div><div>
<p>An <b>AED (Automated External Defibrillator)</b> is a portable electronic device that automatically diagnoses a life-threatening cardiac arrhythmia, such as ventricular tachycardia, in a patient and is able to treat through defibrillation, the application of electrical therapy which stops the arrhythmia, allowing the heart to reestablish an effective rhythm.</p>
<h3>What is CPVT?<br/>
</h3>
<p><b>CPVT</b> is an inherited condition and is believed to affect approximately 1 in 10,000 individuals. It can cause abnormal heart rhythms (arrhythmia) which can result in fainting, cardiac arrest, or sudden death. The abnormal heart rhythms usually happen under certain circumstances such as physical exertion or emotional stress. Although CPVT does not have a cure at this point in time, there are a number of treatments available to help prevent complications: medications or an Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillator (ICD) may be used.</p>
<p>Symptoms of CPVT, including sudden death, are most often experienced in the first two decades of life. This puts children at a greater risk of cardiac arrest and sudden arrhythmia death. (My sister died suddenly from an arrhythmia caused by CPVT at the age of 15.) <br/></p>
<h3>Your Donation Helps</h3>Your donations will make sure that an AED with the proper accessories (child shock pads) stays in our home.
