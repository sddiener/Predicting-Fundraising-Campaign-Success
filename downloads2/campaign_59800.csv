For example, in Korea, toothpastes with fluoride CANNOT be used in infants due to health reasons. And in the U.S., toothpastes with Fluoride have Warning and Call Information to Poison Control Centers. This is not to say Fluoride itself is dangerous. When used at the right amount, in the right method, it is a VERY beneficial substance. However, we do understand that a lot of children (and even adults!) swallow toothpastes (even when we are SO sure we spit it all out!). Also, in order for fluoride to be effective, it needs to be in touch with your teeth for a bit longer than 2 minutes. That's why we are in the works of developing a natural rinse with fluoride in it. That way, YOU have the choice. Lastly, although there are exceptions, in most cases, as a dentist, I personally believe it is actually your diet, brushing habits, and regular visits to the dentist that will keep your smile bright and healthy! We want YOU to have the rights and the choices!</p><p> </p><h3>Is Foam Bad?</h3><p>How does your morning OJ taste after brushing your teeth? Not so pleasant is it? That's because SLS (Sodium Lauryl Sulfate) and SLES (Sodium Laureth Sulfate)--the foaming agents in most toothpastes--<strong>numb down parts of your taste bud</strong>. Yup, every time you're brushing away with rich foam, you are numbing your tongue. Not only that, those foaming agents are actually quite strong detergents, and will dry your saliva out--leaving it more susceptible to Candida yeast and other bacteria. Saliva is crucial in keeping a healthy mouth. Also along with Cinnamon, SLS and SLES can trigger aphthous ulcers!</p><p> </p><h3>What is EWG?</h3><p>EWG stands for Environmental Working Group. They are the leading non-profit organization which works to ""protect human health and environment"". The EWG reviews international regulations regarding over 10,000 cosmetic ingredients and informs and verifies ingredients and products regarding its safety. </p><p> </p><h3>What is PETA?</h3><p>PETA stands for People for Ethical Treatment of Animals.

For example, in Korea, toothpastes with fluoride CANNOT be used in infants due to health reasons. And in the U.S., toothpastes with Fluoride have Warning and Call Information to Poison Control Centers. This is not to say Fluoride itself is dangerous. When used at the right amount, in the right method, it is a VERY beneficial substance. However, we do understand that a lot of children (and even adults!) swallow toothpastes (even when we are SO sure we spit it all out!). Also, in order for fluoride to be effective, it needs to be in touch with your teeth for a bit longer than 2 minutes. That's why we are in the works of developing a natural rinse with fluoride in it. That way, YOU have the choice. Lastly, although there are exceptions, in most cases, as a dentist, I personally believe it is actually your diet, brushing habits, and regular visits to the dentist that will keep your smile bright and healthy! We want YOU to have the rights and the choices! Is Foam Bad?How does your morning OJ taste after brushing your teeth? Not so pleasant is it? That's because SLS (Sodium Lauryl Sulfate) and SLES (Sodium Laureth Sulfate)--the foaming agents in most toothpastes--numb down parts of your taste bud. Yup, every time you're brushing away with rich foam, you are numbing your tongue. Not only that, those foaming agents are actually quite strong detergents, and will dry your saliva out--leaving it more susceptible to Candida yeast and other bacteria. Saliva is crucial in keeping a healthy mouth. Also along with Cinnamon, SLS and SLES can trigger aphthous ulcers! What is EWG?EWG stands for Environmental Working Group. They are the leading non-profit organization which works to ""protect human health and environment"". The EWG reviews international regulations regarding over 10,000 cosmetic ingredients and informs and verifies ingredients and products regarding its safety.  What is PETA?PETA stands for People for Ethical Treatment of Animals. They are the world's largest animal rights organization. If you have seen ads featuring celebrities who stand for animal rights, and also videos that expose the cruelty behind leather products and lab tests, it's very likely they were from PETA.

If I can't raise any money then I don't think i'll ever get the chance to have a baby and feel that empty feeling I have. I am also hoping to show that there are ways to get help when really needed and to be able to help others in the same situation as me. You will always be in my heart and prayers.

What We Need & What You Get
All of the money I raise will go towards my IVF.  
The in vitro fertilization costs will range from around $10,000 to $15,000. Much of the cost will depend on how many cycles or placements of the embryo are needed, to achieve a successful pregnancy.
Women must take hormones prior to the first cycle, to prepare the uterus for implantation. (So, there are additional fees for medications and office visits or consults.)
A couple may also consider time lost from work, for the procedure and clinic visits, as an added expense.

<div>  For those of you who don't know Austin he's a son a brother, a partner and a friend and as a transguy is uninsured for the bulk of his health care needs. Austin is an extraordinary person, when we met he was volunteering nights as a rape crisis counsellor, and spening the rest of his time brightening the lives of those around him. He has dreams of working in psychology or security but for the moment is working hard to make ends meet.  He now voulnteers his extra time with children of displaced/homeless households. He's a stand-up guy with a big heart who will do big things but for the moment he needs our support. Austin's surgery is scheduled for the end of February at Baystate Hospital in Springfield. We hope to reach our fundraising goal of 3,000 dollars by the beginning of the month. </div>
<div> </div>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need </h3>
<p>Austin has been saving for this surgery for some time but he is still severall thousand dollars short of his goal. The overall cost of the surgery, anesthesia, tissue testing panel, and overnight hospital stay is 8,500. Thanks to generous donations from Austin's friends and family we raised 1,500 already at our Operation Celebration Burlesque show! A three thousand dollar deficit remains, help us close the gap and give Austin a new chest!</p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p><em>Why it's important to support individual transition efforts</em>: Healthcare providers have deemed care for gender transition elective and unneccesary. Helping an individual reach their funding goals for surgery is a not only a sign of solidarity but demonstrates the power of the community to support indiviuals who have been marginalized by flawed public policy.</p>

Austin is an extraordinary person, when we met he was volunteering nights as a rape crisis counsellor, and spening the rest of his time brightening the lives of those around him. He has dreams of working in psychology or security but for the moment is working hard to make ends meet.  He now voulnteers his extra time with children of displaced/homeless households. He's a stand-up guy with a big heart who will do big things but for the moment he needs our support. Austin's surgery is scheduled for the end of February at Baystate Hospital in Springfield. We hope to reach our fundraising goal of 3,000 dollars by the beginning of the month. 
 


What We Need 
Austin has been saving for this surgery for some time but he is still severall thousand dollars short of his goal. The overall cost of the surgery, anesthesia, tissue testing panel, and overnight hospital stay is 8,500. Thanks to generous donations from Austin's friends and family we raised 1,500 already at our Operation Celebration Burlesque show! A three thousand dollar deficit remains, help us close the gap and give Austin a new chest!
The Impact
Why it's important to support individual transition efforts: Healthcare providers have deemed care for gender transition elective and unneccesary. Helping an individual reach their funding goals for surgery is a not only a sign of solidarity but demonstrates the power of the community to support indiviuals who have been marginalized by flawed public policy.

DVDs from Trannywood Pictures, San Francisco's own transmale adult video house    

   ""We are a small San Francisco based, safe sex, educational and porn production company bringing together a diversity of trans and other queer men. We believe men are hot. After all, we are men who have sex with men. Our models are in various points in their transition, and we support guys who don’t want or plan on being on hormones or don’t want any surgery, as well as those who do. Thus, our films have diverse men with diverse body types.We are creating porn that presents safer sex practices as the norm but within a harm reduction model. What does that mean? People need to make informed decisions on what they do. In general, that means barriers are best, but it also means if you are sexually active, you should get tested for STDs and HIV on a regular basis. Here in San Francisco, we advocate men getting tested for syphilis every three months and HIV every six months. We also encourage people to get vaccinated for Hepatitis A and B.

Buck Angel's award winning FTM porn documentary: Sexing the Transman

""Sexing the Transman is a groundbreaking mainstream documentary about FTM sexualities. Buck Angel elicits intimate, in-depth conversations with transmen and those who love them—about how their bodies, sexualities, and identities are affected by the medical and social processes of gender  transition.The film highlights how transitioning can open up a greater sense of freedom, desire, and willingness to explore new types of pleasure. It includes interviews with Margaret Cho, who discusses her identity as a queer bottom attracted to masculinity; and FTM comedian Ian Harvie, who reflects on his dysphoria and how his relationship with his body and his sexuality has changed post-transition.""

<p>     I humbly present the following on behalf of my  lifelong friend's older sister....I could not think of anything better than to get this word out. It is a tragic situation but one that every little bit will help to get them through this rough time. At the very least, please pray for them, for healing and peace .....and pass the word, please! </p>
<p>Fran is a single Mom born in 1953 and has struggled all her life to raise her only son Robert (born 7/7/1994) on her own.   She is a recovering alcoholic for the last 29 years but has gone back to school and has earned her AA. After a life of retail and waitressing, she is currently in school trying to get her medical transcription certificate so that she can better provide for herself and Robert.   Robert’s father  comes in and out of his life but has never been a stable influence or consistently been able to provide monetarily . </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Robert was diagnosed with a malignant brain tumor called “Medulloblastoma on 5/17/12.  Because of his age, it is a pediatric type of tumor located in the cerebellum, the part of the brain that controls balance and other complex motor functions.  It is the most common malignant central nervous system tumor in children and accounts for 15-20% of all pediatric brain tumors.  There are about 500 cases of medulloblastoma each year in the US. Sadly, this has caused him to miss his senior year of high school, a time that should be filled with fun and hope for the future.....</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He went into surgery and had most of the tumor removed on 5/20/12. It was 4cm X 5cm.   They could not remove all of the tumor for fear they would do permanent brain damage or worse.   At that time she was told the tumor was benign, but was told later it was indeed malignant Medulloblastoma.   The good news was what that it had not metastasized, the bad news is that after all radiation and chemo, the treatment can cause significant endocrinological, hearing and intellectual difficulties.  After surgery, because of the location of the tumor, the surgeon was amazed that he could even write. Previously,  he tended to be a little clumsy and not as eloquent with speech or good at reading.  Right after the surgery he was talking and able to express himself better than he has ever been able to in his life, sounding like a different person! He told his Mom he was so happy he could express himself. Sadly, chemo has taken its toll on this. </p>
<p>He had radiation for 6 weeks which did shrink the remaining tumor but did not eliminate it.  Chemotherapy  began at the end of August.  He will continue the chemotherapy for one year.  At the end of this time they will do another MRI and determine whether or not the tumor has been eliminated completely or just stopped growing.  From there he will go in every few months at first to ensure the tumor has stopped growing.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Interestingly, this began nearly two years ago when Robert was riding his bicycle on the sidewalk and was hit by a vehicle driven by a drunk driver.  After this accident, he was having pain in his body and headaches.  The body pains eventually subsided, but he was still getting the headaches sporadically.  Then almost a year to the date of this accident, he was in another accident as the passenger in a vehicle.  After this, he started getting severe headaches and starting missing a lot of school.  Fran took him into the ER several times and was told he needed to just take some medication.  The headaches got so bad that he could not even hold his head up. Fran took him back to the ER again and insisted that they take an x-ray.   That was when it all started to fall apart and make sense at the same time.  The x-ray showed something. They did a Cat scan and MRI and found the tumor in the cerebellum.  The Doctor later said that the 2<sup>nd</sup> car accident may have helped save his life because it probably relocated the tumor enough so that his headaches were even more severe. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Fran has been receiving about $800.00 a month from Social Security since Robert’s father is now retired and has been living on that and her student loans.</p>

<h3>My Story</h3>
<p>My name is Amanda Sandeen - if you're reading this, it's likely you know me. I discovered Yoga about a year ago and was totally blown away by the tremendous effect it had on my body. I have chronic asthma, and have never really been able to engage in a real physical workout. I'm also very hyper-active, as any of my friends can attest. For me, Yoga is the only way I feel truly calm, and for the first time in my life, I've felt able to breathe. <br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>My goal with learning Yoga is to be able to work at a treatment facility much like the one the organization I currently volunteer for has. The majority of work I've done for this organization, whose name I have agreed to keep confidential (but my friends and family know, and I expect that is my audience here anyhow), has been basic office work. A large portion of what I've done with them is organizing and formatting customer satisfaction surveys for the auditor. These surveys come from over 20 different facilities the organization provides funding for, from housing, to medical care, to job search assistance, and a treatment facility for people struggling with addiction. I began to see a pattern with the rehab surveys - people on lock down for weeks on end with nothing to do but play cards. They praised the staff at the facility, and the only real complaint was they weren't allowed to go outside, and had no resources to exercise while in the building. I'd like to become a teacher at a Yoga studio and donate my spare time to volunteer at a local rehab facility that serves a homeless or poverty stricken population.<br/></p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Yoga Teacher Training in New York costs roughly $5000 including course materials. I'm aiming to take fall training classes, but if I reach my financial goal in time for the spring course, that would be a dream! I don't expect to reach my goal entirely from this website, but I have put the total cost as my goal so folks can follow my progress, and I can keep track as well. I expect to work along the way and pay for the bulk of it myself, but any assistance I can garner would be much appreciated. <br/></p>

<p><b>Y-Brush has been meticulously engineered by dentist for the last 3+ years, creating the toothbrush of the future offering an effortless and consistent deep cleaning:</b></p>
<ul><li>
<b>Dentist Preferred</b> — Replicates the recommended <i>‘Bass Method’</i> of teeth cleaning with small lateral movements. </li></ul>
<ul><li>
<b>Effortless Cleaning</b> — Consistently cleans your teeth the way they should be using any toothpaste in 10 seconds flat, every time. </li></ul>
<ul><li>
<b>Deeper Cleaning</b> — Sonic vibrations power specialized <u><strong>nylon bristles</strong></u> to clean deep under your gum line, not just the surfaces of your teeth. </li></ul>
<ul><li>
<b>Gentler Cleaning</b> — Single sided mouthpiece in 4 sizes eliminates hard manual scrubbing the leading cause of receding gums.</li></ul>

<h3>Y-Brush employs the Bass-Method of brushing which is the American Dental Association’s (ADA) recommended technique for teeth cleaning.</h3>
<p> </p>
<div data-id=""21856505""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://indiegogo-media-prod-cld-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1534285474/qen0jeclgvpcrvt3zbqk.png"" src=""""/></figure></div>
<p> </p>
<p>The Bass method is a technical brushing movement consists in tilting the head of your toothbrush at a 45° angle while making a rolling motion that more effectively removes plaque, debris, and bacteria from deep under your gum line.</p>
<p>Developed and tested by dentists for the last 3 years, Y-Brush eliminates the bacteria responsible for gingivitis, periodontitis, and gum disease with features required of the Bass Method:</p>
<ul><li>
<b>Bristle Size — </b>The length and width of the bristles are calculated to reach the interdental space, the gingival sulcus and the gums.</li></ul>
<ul><li>
<b>Bristle Shape — </b>Supple and rounded at the ends, the bristles do not damage the gums or the tooth enamel while brushing.</li></ul>
<ul><li>
<b>Bristle Movement — </b>Consistently replicates the technical motion of the Bass Method, deep cleaning your teeth, gums and under the gum line.</li></ul>

<p>The human mouth is composed of 32 teeth with 3 visible facets (front, back and bottom), for a total of 96 ""brushable"" facets overall. If the recommended time for brushing is 2 minutes minimum, then mathematically this means that each tooth facet should be brushed for at least 1.25 seconds for a total of 3.75 seconds per tooth.</p>
<p>In just 5 seconds each for your top and bottom, Y-Brush’s mouthpieces gently brushes each facet of every tooth at once for <b>4x longer</b> per tooth to provide a deeper clean then the recommended 2 minute manual brushing.</p>

<p>During our in vivo and in vitro testing, we found that Nylon bristles are the most effective at removing plaque and cleaning your teeth when compared to other methods like silicone strips. Our studies found that Y-Brush device <b>removes 15% more plaque</b> than a conventional toothbrush!</p>
<p>We made our nylon bristles thinner to make it possible to clean in between your teeth and your gum line. The ends of the bristles are rounded to keep it comfortable and keep your gums safe.</p>
<p>Y-Brush’s patented design took over 3 years to complete. The result is a <b>perfectly engineered toothbrush</b> built to deliver the same cleaning consistency every time you brush your teeth. You’ll know you’re getting a better clean every time.</p>

<h3><a name=""project_faq_254778"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>If dentists recommend 2 minutes how can Y-brush clean teeth in 10 seconds?</strong></a></h3>
<p>Our innovation is based on a simple observation: a standard toothbrush head can only brush one area of the tooth at once which means brushing your teeth takes time. Since Y-Brush brushes all of your teeth simultaneously, then the whole tooth brushing process only takes 10 seconds, 5 seconds for your top teeth and 5 seconds for your bottom teeth: which is 4 times more than a regular toothbrush and more effective to thoroughly and effectively brush your teeth.</p>

Y-Brush, qui a été développée par la société FasTeesH avec l'aide de dentistes depuis près de 3 ans, brosse les dents de manière simultanée au lieu d’un brossage dent par dent. Notre dispositif reproduit pour vous la technique recommandée par les dentistes, la méthode de Bass, et utilise des vibrations soniques, utilisées par une partie des brosses à dents électriques.   Un brossage efficace et sans effort Notre bouche est composée de 32 dents avec 3 facettes visibles (avant, arrière et dessous) soit 96 facettes à nettoyer pendant 2 minutes, soit 1.25 secondes de brossage par facette. Avec Y-Brush, chacune de vos dents sont brossées durant 5 secondes puisque le dispositif vous brosse toute les dents en même temps, soit 4 fois plus qu'avec une brosse à dents manuelle ou électrique traditionnelle. La méthode de Bass La méthode de Bass est un mouvement technique, recommandé par les dentistes, qui consiste à incliner la tête de la brosse avec un angle de 45° tout en effectuant des mouvements de rouleau pour éliminer au mieux la plaque dentaire et les bactéries au niveau du sillon gingival. Sur notre brosse, les poils sont déjà inclinés à 45°, il suffit de “mâcher” très doucement le dispositif pour reproduire cette méthode. De nombreux tests d’efficacité déjà réalisésDurant nos nombreux tests in vitro et in vivo, nous avons démontré que les poils en nylon étaient les plus efficaces pour l'élimination de la plaque dentaire, comparés à d'autres matériaux comme le silicone par exemple. D'autres tests ont aussi démontré que Y-Brush retire 15% de plaque dentaire en plus qu'une brosse à dents traditionnelle. Les bout des poils sont aussi arrondis pour brosser vos dents et vos gencive sans agression.Avant de brosser avec Y-Brush         Après avoir brossé avec Y-Brush Vous pouvez même conserver votre propre dentifricePas besoin d'acheter un dentifrice spécial, vous pouvez garder le votre en utilisant notre applicateur permettant de délivrer du dentifrice de partout sur notre brosse en quantité adaptée. Trois modes de vibrationsAvec ses 3 modes de vibrations, Y-Brush s'adapte à votre sensibilité. Une brosse flexible disponible en 4 taillesAvec ses 4 tailles de brosse, toute la famille peut se servir de Y-Brush (2 tailles adultes, 1 taille enfant et 1 intermédiaire).De plus, la brosse est super flexible et est donc adaptable à toutes les formes de mâchoire, vous assurant aussi un confort d'utilisation à chaque brossage. En effet, la brosse nettoie une arcade de votre mâchoire : le haut plus le bas. Cela permet d’avoir une brosse très fine , non encombrante et qui évite les réflexes nauséeux. Un manche qui peut être partagéLe manche peut être partagé par toute la famille, tant que chacun garde sa brosse! Des matériaux facile à nettoyerLa brosse Y-Brush est faite de matériaux compatibles avec la bouche très proche du silicone. Pour la nettoyer, il suffit de la passer sous l'eau, comme avec votre brosse à dents. Un mois d'autonomie et rechargement sans filL’autonomie de Y-Brush est d’un mois (utilisation 2 fois par jour). Une station de rechargement vous permet de stocker le dispositif tout en le rechargeant sans fil (par induction).    

 
Introducing

Y-Brush, the smarter auto-cleaning electronic toothbrush.
Simultaneously deep clean all your teeth with Y-Brush.
Y-Brush automatically deep cleans your teeth the way dentists recommend them to be cleaned in just 10 seconds using sonic vibrating technology.

 
See How It Works :


 
 

 

Y-Brush has been meticulously engineered by dentist for the last 3+ years, creating the toothbrush of the future offering an effortless and consistent deep cleaning:

Dentist Preferred — Replicates the recommended ‘Bass Method’ of teeth cleaning with small lateral movements. 

Effortless Cleaning — Consistently cleans your teeth the way they should be using any toothpaste in 10 seconds flat, every time. 

Deeper Cleaning — Sonic vibrations power specialized nylon bristles to clean deep under your gum line, not just the surfaces of your teeth. 

Gentler Cleaning — Single sided mouthpiece in 4 sizes eliminates hard manual scrubbing the leading cause of receding gums.
 


Y-Brush employs the Bass-Method of brushing which is the American Dental Association’s (ADA) recommended technique for teeth cleaning.
 

 
The Bass method is a technical brushing movement consists in tilting the head of your toothbrush at a 45° angle while making a rolling motion that more effectively removes plaque, debris, and bacteria from deep under your gum line.
Developed and tested by dentists for the last 3 years, Y-Brush eliminates the bacteria responsible for gingivitis, periodontitis, and gum disease with features required of the Bass Method:

Bristle Size — The length and width of the bristles are calculated to reach the interdental space, the gingival sulcus and the gums.

Bristle Shape — Supple and rounded at the ends, the bristles do not damage the gums or the tooth enamel while brushing.

Bristle Movement — Consistently replicates the technical motion of the Bass Method, deep cleaning your teeth, gums and under the gum line.



Y-Brush cleans your teeth 4x longer per tooth and in a fraction of the time.
 

 
The human mouth is composed of 32 teeth with 3 visible facets (front, back and bottom), for a total of 96 ""brushable"" facets overall. If the recommended time for brushing is 2 minutes minimum, then mathematically this means that each tooth facet should be brushed for at least 1.25 seconds for a total of 3.75 seconds per tooth.
In just 5 seconds each for your top and bottom, Y-Brush’s mouthpieces gently brushes each facet of every tooth at once for 4x longer per tooth to provide a deeper clean then the recommended 2 minute manual brushing.


Other 10 second toothbrush systems don’t focus on the consistent cleaning experience like Y-Brush does.
 


During our in vivo and in vitro testing, we found that Nylon bristles are the most effective at removing plaque and cleaning your teeth when compared to other methods like silicone strips. Our studies found that Y-Brush device removes 15% more plaque than a conventional toothbrush!
We made our nylon bristles thinner to make it possible to clean in between your teeth and your gum line. The ends of the bristles are rounded to keep it comfortable and keep your gums safe.
Y-Brush’s patented design took over 3 years to complete. The result is a perfectly engineered toothbrush built to deliver the same cleaning consistency every time you brush your teeth. You’ll know you’re getting a better clean every time.
See the Nylon Difference:

 

 Keep the brands you love!

 
There’s no need to buy special toothpaste or liquid to use Y-Brush. Use what you know, and avoid having to pay for expensive refill packs. The included applicator tip ensures the right amount of your favorite toothpaste is used, without getting excessive.


 
 



Sonic vibration makes it easier than ever to brush your teeth.
 

 
Not all teeth and gums are the same. We built in three different settings to match your dental care needs. Those with sensitive gum lines can use the lowest setting and still use Y-Brush!
 

Go beyond cleaning the surface. 

 
Y-Brush has been developed with the help of dentists and specialists, to be the best tooth brushing device available. The bristles are inclined at a 45° angle, and their length thought out to reach and properly clean the gum and gum line.



Y-Brush will have the whole family wanting to show off their grins.
 


Y-Brush will have the whole family wanting to show off their grins. Our flexible ABS mouthpiece makes it easy to use so that brushing your teeth isn’t an uncomfortable experience. It comes in 4 different sizes (2 adult, 1 intermediary, 1 children) so that everyone in the family can get a better clean.
We built it with comfort in mind. Focusing on one side of your mouth at a time made it possible to develop a thinner mouthpiece preventing a gag-reflex and freeing up your tongue.

Tough on Plaque, Easy on You

 
Your gum lines can start to recede if you put too much pressure on the brush. While biting down on Y-Brush, you’re leaving the cleaning duty to the powerful sonic vibration and engineered bristles layout. This way you aren’t forcing your gum lines back, while still getting more than the recommended cleaning!
 



Share Y-Brush’s cleaning technology.  

 
Order Y-Brush mouthpieces and pods for everyone in your household. With it taking almost no time to brush, everyone can share the same handle. Our dock keeps mouthpieces separated to ensure that germs and bacteria aren’t shared.


The materials behind Y-Brush make it an easy to clean and care for. 

 
Y-Brush uses a food-grade silicone-like material in its mouthpiece. Clean it with running water like you would with your normal toothbrush. The handle is made with ABS, keeping the motors and battery safe from water.


 Y-Brush’s battery lasts for a full month of brushing!

 
Take it with you on trips and enjoy a clean mouth while traveling abroad. If you’re a globetrotter for work or play, you’ll be able to take Y-Brush with you. The battery holds plenty of charge to brush your teeth the recommended 2 times a day for up to 30 days.


No need to mess with messy cords: Y-Brush’s dock keeps it charged.  

 
Y-Brush’s dock keeps your counters clean with a sleek design to fit any home. Your handle will stay charged with docks for your mouthpieces to dry.

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>Hello, my name is Jay.  Myself, my wife of 21 years, and my 4 children are asking for donations to help pay for medical expenses related to my second open-heart surgery.  I was born with a congenital heart murmur.  This became life threatening 15 years ago when I was 28 years old and had my first open-heart surgery at Seton Medical Center Austin, Texas.  I had the ROSS procedure performed; a cadaver valve was involved in replacing my aortic valve.  This became life threatening again in July of this year, now 43 years old.  Not only did I have to have my aortic valve replaced again, but this time with a St. Jude mechanical valve.  Because of this, I am now on lifetime medications to thin my blood.  Not only was the valve replaced, but I also had a life threatening aneurysm on the ascending aorta of my heart which was repaired at St. Luke's Episcopal Hospital in Houston, Texas.  I had multiple out-patient procedures the week leading up to the surgery and was hospitalized for a week after the surgery.  There were no major complications other than becoming anemic and requiring a blood transfusion.  Not only was I involved in a study for the ROSS procedure 15 years ago, but I am also in two new studies for patients with aneurysms of the aorta and for molecular mechanisms of thoracic aortic disease through Baylor College of Medicine.  Not only do I have a history of heart problems, but also suffer from diabetes, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol.<br/></p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This has been a major impact in my life.  I prayed during my most recent surgery to be able to spend another Christmas with my family.  I am so glad the Lord heard my prayers.  I understand the surgery was in July, however the medical bills are now piling in.  I consented to being a patient in studies for Baylor College of Medicine, however they will not allow me to make monthly payments of what I can afford.  Rather, they are demanding payment and having their credit agency contact me on a weekly basis.  The J J Watt Foundation denied our request for a donation.  We contacted the American Diabetic Association for donation and did not receive a response.  We also contacted the American Heart Association and they do not give individual donations.  I want you to know the contribution you make today will greatly help our family and will greatly be appreciated.  I had no benefits through my employer, therefore I was not paid while off for 10 weeks recovering.  Even though I still see my physician every 2 weeks for blood work, I had to return to work not fully recovered to pay monthly expenses.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong> </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>I am asking for $10,000 to cover out-of-pocket expenses not covered by insurance.  The donations will be distributed to St. Luke's Episcopal Hospital in Houston, Texas; Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, Texas; East Texas Medical Center in Crockett, Texas; and East Texas Medical Center in Tyler, Texas.  These are for outstanding medical expenses incurred for procedures leading up to the surgery, for the actual surgery itself, and for procedures still incurring after the surgery.  For the largest single donation received, we will give away a signed drumhead by all members of the Restless Heart Band recently signed in October of this year to help raise money for my medical expenses.<br/></p>

<p>We, the founders of THEMAGIC5, are all swim enthusiast. We believe all swimmers deserve the best swimming experience. We want to do things differently and challenge the status quo.</p>
<p>To challenge the status quo, we say: One size shall fit only one. We have invented technologies, re-thought the design and production process of our product - all of this to ensure the best swimming experience for you.</p>
<p>By custom fitting the goggle to its owner, we have reinvented the swimming goggle. We are selling goggles that fit perfectly. They are comfortable to wear, prevent water leakage and provide the best swimming experience on the market.</p>

<p>Our goggles are custom fitted, but it is not all. By focusing on the following 5 key aspects we have reinvented the swimming goggle.<b> </b></p>
<p><b>FITTING</b> – The goggle will fit the exact curvature around your eyes. This way your goggle will fit you and only you. The hardness of the material that touches your face has been tested to ensure that the goggle is comfortable to wear while at the same time providing the necessary stability to keep the goggle in place.</p>
<p><b>TEMPLES </b>– The temples on both sides of the goggle are designed to stabilize it during swim, start and push-off. The shape of the temple is designed such that it will guide the goggle into its optimal position when you put it on.</p>
<p><b>NOSEBRIDGE</b> – The nose bridge is built in a tough material designed to stabilize the goggle. The width of the nose bridge is individually determined for you, based on the scan of your facial structures.</p>
<p><b>GLASS</b> – In order to meet all possible conditions and preferences the lenses come in multiple color options. We advise that you choose mirror coating if you swim outdoors, but they can also be worn indoors as a fashion statement. We guarantee that you will look amazing. All our lenses are treated with the best anti-fog coating on the market.</p>
<p><b>CURVES</b> – The curved glass provides optimal visibility while helping you to keep a correct head position. The curves form a slight angle in the glass, which makes the goggles very hydrodynamic and it significantly increases your ability to locate competitors and navigate during a race.</p>

<p>Getting your goggle is made easy. You can sit at home on your couch, download our app and complete the scan. The app will guide you through the scanning process, which will take less than 1 minute. When the scan is complete you can purchase your goggle, and we will start producing it immediately.</p>
<p>The app will be released when our crowdfunding campaign is finalized. All backers will receive a voucher code, which must be entered after the scanning process to validate your purchase from Kickstarter.</p>

<p>We have tested our goggles in collaboration with athletes who use swimming goggles every day. Among the testers are pro swimmers and triathletes as well as recreational swimmers. Our ambition has been to provide the best swimming experience for swimmers at all levels.</p>
<p>The feedback we received from our testers has helped us to optimize our product. 9 out of 10 testers claimed that THEMAGIC5 was better than their current goggle. It automatically becomes easier to focus on the stroke and technique without having to worry about misfitted goggles.</p>

<p>Until now, our production has been based on a manual process, which has certain drawbacks:</p>
<ul>
<li>A manual process involves the risk of human error. And since we are working with a very HIGH level of precision in order to make the goggles fit perfectly, we cannot afford such errors.</li>
<li>We are currently unable to produce at a larger scale, which means we will not be able to supply more than a few units a day. This simply makes our operations too expensive. In other words, we need to be able to scale our production.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The solution</strong> is heavy machinery, including robotic production technologies. Unfortunately, these things do not come cheap. This is why we did a KICKSTARTER campaign: To finance the last part of our production line so that we can make the world's best swimming goggle, 100% custom fitted to you and at an affordable price.<br/><br/><strong>Continuing</strong><strong> InDemand for Pre-orders. </strong>As we got successfully funded on Kickstarter (200%), we have begun the process of implementing the Robot into our production line. During this implementation process, we will take pre-orders here on Indiegogo InDemand. <br/>Place your perk to ensure that you are among the very first in the world to get your own Custom Fitted swimming Goggles. <br/> </p>

<h3>Risks and challenges</h3>
<p>At this stage of our project, we have:</p>
<p>- Proved that our technology is working.<br/>- Tested our technology in real life<br/>- Scanned many swimmers<br/>- Produced many goggles that fit perfect to each individual<br/>- Tested all aspects of our production line</p>
<p>Testers say that our product is superior to standard ""one size fits all"" swimming goggle.</p>
<p>Due to the above, we see limited risks associated with our project. However, there are two things that could result in slight delays:</p>
<p>1. Implementation of the final production hardware that will be purchased<br/>after the KICKSTARTER campaign.<br/>- MITIGATION: We have already leased the production hardware, which<br/>has allowed us to test how to implement it in our production line.<br/>Throughout the leasing period we have obtained knowledge on the<br/>actual implementation process for the new hardware that we are<br/>funding through KICKSTARTER.</p>
<p>2. Unforeseen challenges with our app when we start introducing more<br/>people to the final test environment.<br/>- MITIGATION: During the past months we have continuously used our<br/>app to scan our testers and ambassadors. This means that we have<br/>already tested the app significantly, and know that our scanning<br/>technology is working.</p>

The hardness of the material that touches your face has been tested to ensure that the goggle is comfortable to wear while at the same time providing the necessary stability to keep the goggle in place.
TEMPLES – The temples on both sides of the goggle are designed to stabilize it during swim, start and push-off. The shape of the temple is designed such that it will guide the goggle into its optimal position when you put it on.
NOSEBRIDGE – The nose bridge is built in a tough material designed to stabilize the goggle. The width of the nose bridge is individually determined for you, based on the scan of your facial structures.
GLASS – In order to meet all possible conditions and preferences the lenses come in multiple color options. We advise that you choose mirror coating if you swim outdoors, but they can also be worn indoors as a fashion statement. We guarantee that you will look amazing. All our lenses are treated with the best anti-fog coating on the market.
CURVES – The curved glass provides optimal visibility while helping you to keep a correct head position. The curves form a slight angle in the glass, which makes the goggles very hydrodynamic and it significantly increases your ability to locate competitors and navigate during a race.

Getting your goggle is made easy. You can sit at home on your couch, download our app and complete the scan. The app will guide you through the scanning process, which will take less than 1 minute. When the scan is complete you can purchase your goggle, and we will start producing it immediately.
The app will be released when our crowdfunding campaign is finalized. All backers will receive a voucher code, which must be entered after the scanning process to validate your purchase from Kickstarter.

 

We have tested our goggles in collaboration with athletes who use swimming goggles every day. Among the testers are pro swimmers and triathletes as well as recreational swimmers. Our ambition has been to provide the best swimming experience for swimmers at all levels.
The feedback we received from our testers has helped us to optimize our product. 9 out of 10 testers claimed that THEMAGIC5 was better than their current goggle. It automatically becomes easier to focus on the stroke and technique without having to worry about misfitted goggles.

Our goggles are available in multiple color options. For now, you only have to decide if you want mirror or standard coating. Later, when our app is released and when you have completed the scanning process, you will choose the color.

 

 

 

 

 

 
 
 
 
 
  
 

Until now, our production has been based on a manual process, which has certain drawbacks:

A manual process involves the risk of human error. And since we are working with a very HIGH level of precision in order to make the goggles fit perfectly, we cannot afford such errors.
We are currently unable to produce at a larger scale, which means we will not be able to supply more than a few units a day. This simply makes our operations too expensive. In other words, we need to be able to scale our production.

The solution is heavy machinery, including robotic production technologies. Unfortunately, these things do not come cheap. This is why we did a KICKSTARTER campaign: To finance the last part of our production line so that we can make the world's best swimming goggle, 100% custom fitted to you and at an affordable price.Continuing InDemand for Pre-orders. As we got successfully funded on Kickstarter (200%), we have begun the process of implementing the Robot into our production line. During this implementation process, we will take pre-orders here on Indiegogo InDemand. Place your perk to ensure that you are among the very first in the world to get your own Custom Fitted swimming Goggles.

Risks and challenges
At this stage of our project, we have:
- Proved that our technology is working.- Tested our technology in real life- Scanned many swimmers- Produced many goggles that fit perfect to each individual- Tested all aspects of our production line
Testers say that our product is superior to standard ""one size fits all"" swimming goggle.
Due to the above, we see limited risks associated with our project. However, there are two things that could result in slight delays:
1. Implementation of the final production hardware that will be purchasedafter the KICKSTARTER campaign.- MITIGATION: We have already leased the production hardware, whichhas allowed us to test how to implement it in our production line.Throughout the leasing period we have obtained knowledge on theactual implementation process for the new hardware that we arefunding through KICKSTARTER.
2. Unforeseen challenges with our app when we start introducing morepeople to the final test environment.- MITIGATION: During the past months we have continuously used ourapp to scan our testers and ambassadors. This means that we havealready tested the app significantly, and know that our scanningtechnology is working.",19.0,1,"1 Campaign

<p>Our whole-hearted intention is to simply bring healing to everyONE willing to open up and allow themselves to become the healer in their own lives. Healing One is a balanced healing establishment allowing for a passive and an active approach to healing.  Healing modalities include, but are not limited to: float tanks, infrared saunas, energy healing, massage therapy, sound therapy, yoga, flow arts, meditation and oxygen therapy.   </p>
<p>Chaz Allen, Head Honcho of Healing One has been doing energy healing work for the past 5 years even though he has been a healer his entire life.  He has studied many different healing modalities and art forms, as well as ways of living a healthful and balanced lifestyle.  He has always dreamed of opening up a space where healers could come practice their gift and help progress the knowledge and awareness of healing for all living things.  As the years progressed, Chaz continued his research for various healing arts and eventually discovered sensory deprivation tanks, also known as float tanks. <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> N</span>ot long after experiencing his first few floats did Chaz know that he had found the last piece to the healing establishment puzzle.  </p>

<h3>WHERE</h3>
<p>Chaz and Tai have deep roots in Nevada, being raised in Elko and residing in Reno has helped them become a part of a few unique, strong communities. They feel that they should serve healing to their local communities first and foremost, sprouting here at home and then growing with time. Their first establishment will be in Reno and as time progresses, Healing One will expand by opening a healing center in Elko, NV. </p>

<p>Why?! Healing is why!  Taking time to rest and recover is all part of the balance of life.  We want to do more, forget less, perform better and have it all come effortlessly.  Unfortunately, our physiology and neurochemistry often have other things in mind.  We are a body, a mind, and a soul and all three require activity and healing.  As our logo defines, with the Infinity symbol atop of the Yin and Yang...Infinite Balance is the key to an optimized life experience.</p>
<p><b>Healing is love!</b></p>

<p>Now let us talk about the hype on this sensory deprivation thing for a minute! These sensory deprivation tanks or float tanks as we like to call them are filled with water that is at skin-temperature and has enough epsom salt to allow a person to be suspended in the water, which places you in an environment where approximately 80% of the gravity we usually feel is no longer weighing down on the body. The tank is also soundproof and pitch-black, creating a space that is free of any stimulation from the outside world. This feeling of antigravity and complete deprivation of senses allows for the body, mind, and soul to rest, relax, and rejuvenate optimally. This is the most ideal resting/recovering/healing zone! And it is proven by the number of float centers that exist worldwide which is now more than 900. What’s truly impressive about float tanks is that almost every one of these benefits lasts for several days past the float itself. The longer and the more often the float tank is used, the stronger the effects become, the longer they last, and the better off someone is when they come in to float again. This creates a positive spiral of recovery and health that simply works to reinforce itself, giving people a path and a means towards a better life.</p>

<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Benefits</span><br/>
</h3></b><p><b>Float Tanks: </b></p>
<p>-Down shifts brain waves from our normal Beta frequency down into Alpha and even Theta brain waves. (Hutchisen, 1984) Theta brain waves are most commonly associated with learning and memory, REM sleep, physical activity, etc.</p>
<p>-Effective in helping reduce hypertension, weight, and addiction. (Borrie and Suedfeld, 1980) (Suedfeld and Baker-Brown, 1987) (Kristeller et al., 1982)</p>

<p>-Found to reduce general stress all the way down to the hormonal level (Turner and Fine, 1983), especially following multiple sessions. (Suedfeld et al., 1983) (van Dierendonck and Nijenhuis, 2005) Floatation therapy has also helped reduce pain in many cases. (Shafranksy, 1998) (Rogan et al., 2001)</p>
<p>-Enhancement to cognitive processes involved with creativity and problem solving, as well as a notable decrease in tension, depression, fatigue, and hostility. (Suedfeld et al., 1987) (Forgays and Forgays, 1992/1994) (Norlander et al., 1998) There was also an improvement in cognitive behavioral treatment in psychological disorders such  as OCD and Schyzotypal personality disorders. (Walker et al., 1994)</p>
<p>-After a float you feel like a cloud, not like walking on a cloud but actually being the cloud...nice and light!</p>

<p><b>Singing Bowls/Sound Healing Therapy:</b></p>
<p>These instruments give an almost immediate sense of peace and wholeness and when played for others as a 'sound therapy' session can awaken a deep inner stillness and the flavor of the sacred.  The power of sound, and more accurately said, the effects of frequency via sound, as demonstrated in the Indian Ragas, instrumental-based shamanism, gongs, Tibetan bowls, etc. are some of the most effective external means for consciousness shifting and some would argue, for physical and psychological healing.</p>

<p><span style=""font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 30px;"">HOW </span></p>
<p>*We have put together a business plan and a marketing plan.</p>
<p>*Found a potential centrally located building in Reno</p>
<p>*Talk to contractors of all the trades</p>
<p>*Contacted the NV state health department as well as the Washoe County Health department and the City of Reno.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The reason for our campaign goal being set at $200,000 is mostly because of the custom buildout for this healing establishment and the equipment being put in. We need to build custom sound and salt proof rooms for the float tanks as well as build out the rest of the healing establishment. This includes the activated flow side which will have a place for yoga, workshops, movement and the oxygen chill lounge. The equipment we will be putting in includes: float tanks, infrared saunas, oxygen concentrators, water purification systems, as well as all the necessary equipment for the activated flow area. Our business plan covers a necessary financial start up amount and an ideal financial start up amount. When we reach our fund goal of $200,000 we will be able to open 2 float rooms, 1 Infrared Sauna room, and our oxygen chill lounge. If we reach our ideal fund goal of $250,000 we then can open up 3 float rooms, 2 Infrared sauna rooms, our oxygen chill lounge AND our activated flow area!!! If we don't quite reach our goal we can still use all of the contributions to help us with either an investor or a bank loan. We are willing and ready to open up this unique healing establishment with the help from our communities and connections around us involved in seeing the betterment in life, in people, and in the world we live in.</p>

<h3><br/></h3>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges </h3>
<p>Most of our challenges and risks come with building the healing establishment. We will have to renovate the building we choose because the float tanks need proper insulted rooms and a specific type of flooring. The float tank rooms need to be sound proofed to rid the room of any external noise so that your floating experience is 100% quiet and peaceful. The floors of the rooms need to be sealed very, very well considering the high salt content (850lbs. in each tank) can potentially be damaging to the building’s structure; salt water can seep into the crevices leading to corrosion. The rest of the room should be fully sealed as well to keep its temperature at a constant 90-95 degrees Fahrenheit. These are the necessary precautions that need to be considered, otherwise undoable damage could occur later on. The goal is to do it right the first time. We will also be adding 2 to 4 shower set ups for each of the float rooms as it is a preliminary to floating.</p>
<p>We feel this process is most definitely a hurdle we can jump. As we mentioned earlier we have spoken to many contractors in the Reno area and we have our list of professionals building out this location. Chaz has also been through the float apprenticeship program through a company called Float On located in Portland, OR., where he learned everything from checking and maintaining the water quality in the tanks, the process of building float rooms, to the business side of floating and how to market yourself and your establishment properly. Healing One will continue to work with Float On to dial in our float rooms and our overall business.</p>
<p>Another risk of course is starting and opening a business and becoming successful business owners! We say, challenge accepted! This life is all about progression, finding a way to keep moving forward each and every. To be business men/women in this life is really all about perspective. We are healers and that is what we are...but we are also fire spinners, herbalists, students, teachers, employees, dancers, entrepreneurs, electricians and many other things. If you want to be something, go learn about someone doing what you want to do! If your heart desires a goal you have every right to attain that goal. </p>

Our whole-hearted intention is to simply bring healing to everyONE willing to open up and allow themselves to become the healer in their own lives. Healing One is a balanced healing establishment allowing for a passive and an active approach to healing.  Healing modalities include, but are not limited to: float tanks, infrared saunas, energy healing, massage therapy, sound therapy, yoga, flow arts, meditation and oxygen therapy.   
Chaz Allen, Head Honcho of Healing One has been doing energy healing work for the past 5 years even though he has been a healer his entire life.  He has studied many different healing modalities and art forms, as well as ways of living a healthful and balanced lifestyle.  He has always dreamed of opening up a space where healers could come practice their gift and help progress the knowledge and awareness of healing for all living things.  As the years progressed, Chaz continued his research for various healing arts and eventually discovered sensory deprivation tanks, also known as float tanks.  Not long after experiencing his first few floats did Chaz know that he had found the last piece to the healing establishment puzzle.  


Tai Jaques, Mama Monarch of Healing One is from Spring Creek, NV.  She's a holistic healer whose passions include massage therapy, herbal medicine and Paleo nutrition.  Her eclectic bodywork style blends stretching, deep tissue massage, subtle energy work, and the use of therapeutic herbs.  In her free time she loves to create Golden Monarch Herbals' products.  Her diverse studies and experiences allow her to approach each client with eyes, heart, and mind open to a variety of treatment options.  She loves what she does and is so stoked to share her gift with Healing One and the community.  

           The dream of creating Healing One is slowly manifesting into a reality...  



WHERE
Chaz and Tai have deep roots in Nevada, being raised in Elko and residing in Reno has helped them become a part of a few unique, strong communities. They feel that they should serve healing to their local communities first and foremost, sprouting here at home and then growing with time. Their first establishment will be in Reno and as time progresses, Healing One will expand by opening a healing center in Elko, NV. 


WHY
Why?! Healing is why!  Taking time to rest and recover is all part of the balance of life.  We want to do more, forget less, perform better and have it all come effortlessly.  Unfortunately, our physiology and neurochemistry often have other things in mind.  We are a body, a mind, and a soul and all three require activity and healing.  As our logo defines, with the Infinity symbol atop of the Yin and Yang...Infinite Balance is the key to an optimized life experience.
Healing is love!


Now let us talk about the hype on this sensory deprivation thing for a minute! These sensory deprivation tanks or float tanks as we like to call them are filled with water that is at skin-temperature and has enough epsom salt to allow a person to be suspended in the water, which places you in an environment where approximately 80% of the gravity we usually feel is no longer weighing down on the body. The tank is also soundproof and pitch-black, creating a space that is free of any stimulation from the outside world. This feeling of antigravity and complete deprivation of senses allows for the body, mind, and soul to rest, relax, and rejuvenate optimally. This is the most ideal resting/recovering/healing zone! And it is proven by the number of float centers that exist worldwide which is now more than 900. What’s truly impressive about float tanks is that almost every one of these benefits lasts for several days past the float itself. The longer and the more often the float tank is used, the stronger the effects become, the longer they last, and the better off someone is when they come in to float again. This creates a positive spiral of recovery and health that simply works to reinforce itself, giving people a path and a means towards a better life.

Benefits
Float Tanks: 
-Down shifts brain waves from our normal Beta frequency down into Alpha and even Theta brain waves. (Hutchisen, 1984) Theta brain waves are most commonly associated with learning and memory, REM sleep, physical activity, etc.
-Effective in helping reduce hypertension, weight, and addiction. (Borrie and Suedfeld, 1980) (Suedfeld and Baker-Brown, 1987) (Kristeller et al., 1982)
-Decompresses the muscles, joints, and spine of the body to open up and relax for proper alignment and circulation to flow through the body by lowering one's heart rate (Forgays and Belinson, 1986).
-Found to reduce general stress all the way down to the hormonal level (Turner and Fine, 1983), especially following multiple sessions. (Suedfeld et al., 1983) (van Dierendonck and Nijenhuis, 2005) Floatation therapy has also helped reduce pain in many cases. (Shafranksy, 1998) (Rogan et al., 2001)
-Enhancement to cognitive processes involved with creativity and problem solving, as well as a notable decrease in tension, depression, fatigue, and hostility. (Suedfeld et al., 1987) (Forgays and Forgays, 1992/1994) (Norlander et al., 1998) There was also an improvement in cognitive behavioral treatment in psychological disorders such  as OCD and Schyzotypal personality disorders. (Walker et al., 1994)
-After a float you feel like a cloud, not like walking on a cloud but actually being the cloud...nice and light!


Infrared Saunas:

-Detox  of chemicals & heavy metals that are stored in fat cells
-Strengthens & regenerates body organs 
-May decrease pain through stimulation
-May promote weight loss
(Hannuksela and Ellahham, 2001)

Fun Facts: 
*15 minutes of sweating in an infrared sauna eliminates as much toxic waste as 24 hours of normal kidney function.
* One of the most important times in your life to use a sauna for detoxification is when you start preparing for having a child. Both the future father and future mother should do a detoxification program before getting pregnant 
*Tests have shown that the energy output is tuned so closely to the body's own radiant energy that our bodies absorb as much as 93% of the far infrared waves that reach our skin.

Massage:
-Increases circulation
-Alleviates pain and increases range of motion
-Relieves anxiety & depression
-Decreases stress
(Field, 2014)
-Improves immune function due to increases in lymph flow and spread of endogenous immune-associated molecules (Tejero-Fernandez et al., 2014)




Yoga:
-Increases endurance, flexibility and strength (Patel et al., 2012)
-Helps relieve stress and calm the mind (Li et al., 2012)
-Reduces hypertension, blood glucose levels, cholesterol, body weight (Okanta, 2012)
-Increases proprioception, vitality, energy, resperation

Energy Healing:
-Cleansing and clearing of stagnant, negative energy 
-Boost of good, positive energy and healing towards ones intention for their life
-Reduced pain and increase in mobility (Lu et al., 2013) (Olsen et al., 2003) (Coakly and Barron, 2012)
-Reduced stress, anxiety, and depression (Thrane and Cohen, 2013) (Van Aken and Tayler, 2009) 
-Revitalizing and cleansing the Chakras 


Singing Bowls/Sound Healing Therapy:
These instruments give an almost immediate sense of peace and wholeness and when played for others as a 'sound therapy' session can awaken a deep inner stillness and the flavor of the sacred.  The power of sound, and more accurately said, the effects of frequency via sound, as demonstrated in the Indian Ragas, instrumental-based shamanism, gongs, Tibetan bowls, etc. are some of the most effective external means for consciousness shifting and some would argue, for physical and psychological healing.

HOW 
*We have put together a business plan and a marketing plan.
*Found a potential centrally located building in Reno
*Talk to contractors of all the trades
*Contacted the NV state health department as well as the Washoe County Health department and the City of Reno.

The reason for our campaign goal being set at $200,000 is mostly because of the custom buildout for this healing establishment and the equipment being put in. We need to build custom sound and salt proof rooms for the float tanks as well as build out the rest of the healing establishment. This includes the activated flow side which will have a place for yoga, workshops, movement and the oxygen chill lounge. The equipment we will be putting in includes: float tanks, infrared saunas, oxygen concentrators, water purification systems, as well as all the necessary equipment for the activated flow area. Our business plan covers a necessary financial start up amount and an ideal financial start up amount. When we reach our fund goal of $200,000 we will be able to open 2 float rooms, 1 Infrared Sauna room, and our oxygen chill lounge. If we reach our ideal fund goal of $250,000 we then can open up 3 float rooms, 2 Infrared sauna rooms, our oxygen chill lounge AND our activated flow area!!! If we don't quite reach our goal we can still use all of the contributions to help us with either an investor or a bank loan. We are willing and ready to open up this unique healing establishment with the help from our communities and connections around us involved in seeing the betterment in life, in people, and in the world we live in.



WHO
Help US, help EVERYONE!  Through this Indiegogo campaign, a little hard work and a lot of love, we will be lifted up by those who believe in good people doing good things.
Teaming up and contributing to Healing One is the best case scenario! The contributors, donators, and the community will help bring Healing One to its feet and in turn, Healing One will help to bring healing and support to the community and all involved with this wonderful idea.



Risks & Challenges 
Most of our challenges and risks come with building the healing establishment. We will have to renovate the building we choose because the float tanks need proper insulted rooms and a specific type of flooring. The float tank rooms need to be sound proofed to rid the room of any external noise so that your floating experience is 100% quiet and peaceful. The floors of the rooms need to be sealed very, very well considering the high salt content (850lbs. in each tank) can potentially be damaging to the building’s structure; salt water can seep into the crevices leading to corrosion. The rest of the room should be fully sealed as well to keep its temperature at a constant 90-95 degrees Fahrenheit. These are the necessary precautions that need to be considered, otherwise undoable damage could occur later on. The goal is to do it right the first time. We will also be adding 2 to 4 shower set ups for each of the float rooms as it is a preliminary to floating.
We feel this process is most definitely a hurdle we can jump. As we mentioned earlier we have spoken to many contractors in the Reno area and we have our list of professionals building out this location. Chaz has also been through the float apprenticeship program through a company called Float On located in Portland, OR., where he learned everything from checking and maintaining the water quality in the tanks, the process of building float rooms, to the business side of floating and how to market yourself and your establishment properly. Healing One will continue to work with Float On to dial in our float rooms and our overall business.
Another risk of course is starting and opening a business and becoming successful business owners! We say, challenge accepted! This life is all about progression, finding a way to keep moving forward each and every. To be business men/women in this life is really all about perspective. We are healers and that is what we are...but we are also fire spinners, herbalists, students, teachers, employees, dancers, entrepreneurs, electricians and many other things. If you want to be something, go learn about someone doing what you want to do! If your heart desires a goal you have every right to attain that goal.

<h3>My name is Ronnie ""RJ"" Boling, I am a 29 year old single father of 2. Xander (age 8), and Gracie (age 21 months). </h3>
<div>I have been struggling with my weight now for over a decade. I have done diet and exercise regimen supervised by both physicians and at one time a personal trainer. After literally no success (and even weight gain), the doctors did blood work on me and everything came back ok. They were kind of miffed. They could not prescribe diet pills due to high blood pressure, so the only thing they could think was less calories and more exercise. I got my caloric intake down to 750 per day, and I was constantly tired and miserable, I felt I was unable to get enough calories to even function, still I gained weight.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>The doctor suggested a sleep study to try and diagnose my fatigue. I had my sleep study and it was discovered that I have severe sleep apnea, and had 93 breathing episodes an hour, and never got past the 2nd stage of sleep. I am at a higher risk of stroke and heart disease. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Shortly after that, I crippled myself with a broken ankle, and since the broken ankle I have gained most all of my weight back. My doctor finally suggested that I get bariatric surgery, as he felt it was my only option. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>I called my Insurance company and they absolutely do not, under any circumstances, cover bariatric surgery.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I turned to a local non-profit hospital and put together their charity packet that is available for single parents, and low income families. I put together the packet with letters of medical necessity from my GP, Chiro, and Sleep Doctor, along with my medical records showing extensive attempts at weight loss. It was approved all the way up the line until it got to the CFO's desk. She declined it stating that it was ""elective"". I heard from a local source, that she declined it, because she was afraid if she approved one bariatric surgery that people would take advantage of it.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>My son is starting football later this year, and I can't even go out and throw the ball with him, he can outrun me already, and is constantly asking when we will be able to play football.

</div></div>","My name is Ronnie ""RJ"" Boling, I am a 29 year old single father of 2. Xander (age 8), and Gracie (age 21 months). 
I have been struggling with my weight now for over a decade. I have done diet and exercise regimen supervised by both physicians and at one time a personal trainer. After literally no success (and even weight gain), the doctors did blood work on me and everything came back ok. They were kind of miffed. They could not prescribe diet pills due to high blood pressure, so the only thing they could think was less calories and more exercise. I got my caloric intake down to 750 per day, and I was constantly tired and miserable, I felt I was unable to get enough calories to even function, still I gained weight.
 
The doctor suggested a sleep study to try and diagnose my fatigue. I had my sleep study and it was discovered that I have severe sleep apnea, and had 93 breathing episodes an hour, and never got past the 2nd stage of sleep. I am at a higher risk of stroke and heart disease. 
 
Shortly after that, I crippled myself with a broken ankle, and since the broken ankle I have gained most all of my weight back. My doctor finally suggested that I get bariatric surgery, as he felt it was my only option. 
 
I called my Insurance company and they absolutely do not, under any circumstances, cover bariatric surgery.
 
I turned to a local non-profit hospital and put together their charity packet that is available for single parents, and low income families. I put together the packet with letters of medical necessity from my GP, Chiro, and Sleep Doctor, along with my medical records showing extensive attempts at weight loss. It was approved all the way up the line until it got to the CFO's desk. She declined it stating that it was ""elective"". I heard from a local source, that she declined it, because she was afraid if she approved one bariatric surgery that people would take advantage of it.
 
My son is starting football later this year, and I can't even go out and throw the ball with him, he can outrun me already, and is constantly asking when we will be able to play football. My daughter is running and playing around, and I can barely keep up with her. I want to be around for my children as they grow older. Sometimes I wonder if I am going to be around if I don't get this fixed. 
 
I am not usually one to ask for a handout, but I know when to suck up my pride, and I have seen so many good people on here, I thought I would give it a try. 
 
I have a blog, and if this works, I will blog my progress for the world to see.

What I Need & What You Get
This is what the funds will cover.
The surgery costs roughly 18-19k. I have a $4000 credit card that I plan on covering the difference on.
I will blog weekly on my blog listed above with progress pictures.
If for some reason I do not make my entire goal, I will plead with the hospital to give me a discounted cash rate. If I still do not have enough money, I will travel to another hospital, out of state if necessary.


The Impact
If this goal becomes a reality, I will be able to live a healthy life, and enjoy my kids for a long time to come. I will be able to run around outside with them, travel to theme parks, and not have to worry if the seats are big enough in concerts and sports stadiums.
I believe that people are good, and I understand that there are people out there that have it worse than me, and there are also people who take advantage of these types of charities. I promise you, this will be life changing for my family and I.


Other Ways You Can Help
Help me find a hospital that will do charity surgery, or work with my insurance company, or even a payment plan for someone with less than stellar credit.

<p><span><a href=""http://www.petalsoffice.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Petals Office</a> </span>begun as a side project aiming for the development of a more efficient and simpler user interface.

<p><span></span></p>
<h3>Creating a
new suite</h3>
<p>Working with various office
suites throughout the years, I always felt there was a need for
change on their interface. Being forced to change windows from
spreadsheet to document editor, is a typical annoyance, even on
modern computers where there is enough screen space to display both
windows side by side. No matter which type of document you are
working on, many of the editing options are difficult to find, hidden
on sub menus and dialogs, or are missing altogether on some suites.</p>
<p>The aim of Petals Office is
to solve all such problems through a simple adaptive interface, easy
to learn and friendly to the user.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/156694/files/20131026230540-Pen_All_nt.png?1382853940"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h3>Supported
Platforms 
</h3>
<p>The platforms which will be supported are <b>Linux</b>, major distributions such as Debian Fedora and
openSUSE plus derivatives, <b>Windows</b>, from XP and up, and finally <b>OS X</b>. The suite will have <b>identical features</b> on those operating systems, there will only be slight customization on its appearance. Support for tablets, such as <b>Android</b>, will start after the completion of the first stable desktop version.<br/></p>
<p>The current code is
implemented on C++ and Python, using the wxWidgets toolkit. The
objective is to create a slick versatile and fast application suite,
whilst keeping the look and feel of each OS. <a href=""https://pypi.python.org/pypi/odfpy"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">ODFpy</a> is used for the
manipulation of <a href=""http://www.opendocumentformat.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">OpenDocument</a> files. It has been considered releasing it
as open source, but such a decision will only be taken with concern
for the future of the program.</p>
<h3>Design</h3>
The design, although it
can't be considered unique these days, is optimized for touch
screens, and is build around ease of use, under the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">KISS principle</a>.<br/><p>Since newest computers use wide screens, the
toolbar was moved to the side, to take advantage of unused space and free the most useful screen real estate, its height. In comparison the Ribbon
toolbar, on the latest Microsoft Office layout, is located at the top
of your window at expense of your documents. 
</p>
<p>Having all office applications in the same interface, through
different tabs, helps concentrate all -and on- your work. You can
view multiple documents of all supported types (text, spreadsheet,
pdf etc) <b>side by side</b>, or in a<b> top bottom split layout</b>. On a 24-inch
desktop screen, it is possible to view two full A4 pages side by

<p>It also makes cooperation possible, between what would otherwise be different applications. For example you can insert a table in a document, view it in spreadsheet mode, create and edit a chart and move it back into the document, in no time. <br/></p>
<p>The adaptive foldable toolbar comprises of task specific groups of
buttons. This interface resembles that of smart-phones
and tablets, and helps users with touch screens do their work faster
and easier. The grouping helps you find the task quickly and will

The groups and their contents adapt, depending on the type of the document you are focused on, so

<h2>Who we are and what we want (the Campaign)</h2>
<p>We are a home-based business, Bit64 Solutions Ltd., primarily providing IT professional services to small, medium, and large enterprise clients. The RJClip is our first venture outside of selling services. Everyone in our family is involved with bringing the RJClip to the market. It's an exciting time for us.</p>
<p>We are launching the RJClip through Indiegogo because we feel this is the best place to launch a product such as ours. Here, our crowdfunding campaign will help us understand our customers, create media exposure, and raise capital to fund product and business expenses.   </p>
<h2>What is an RJClip?</h2>
<p>The RJClip is an easy and inexpensive way to replace the broken clip on a RJ45 connector at the end of a network cable. It allows the network cable to securely plug into a switch or wall jack. </p>
<p><em>NOTE: Telephone cords use RJ11 connectors. Despite the fact that they look similar, the RJ11 connector is smaller than the RJ45 connector. The RJClip is designed for RJ45 connectors, and therefore is too big for an RJ11 connector. We are planning to develop this version later in the campaign. </em><strong><em><br/></em></strong></p>
<p><img alt=""Solidworks rendering of the RJClip"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/891365/pictures/full/20130624222651-RJ45_Clip.jpg?1372138018"" src="""" style="""" title=""Solidworks RJClip""/></p>
<h2><strong><span>What does this mean to you?</span></strong></h2>
<p>Using the RJClip to fix broken network cable clips allows you to save time and money. Instead of spending time crimping a new RJ45 connector onto the cable or spending money to buy a new network cable, you can simply clip an RJClip onto the broken network head and continue to use the cable. The design and material of the RJClip ensures it lasts many times longer than the original clip.  As a result, it mimimizes waste and contributes to a greener way of life.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>What colours does it come in?</h3>
<p>The RJClip is currently available in Red, White, Black, Green, Yellow, and Blue.</p>
<p> <img alt=""RJClip Colors"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/891371/pictures/full/20130624222857-RJCLip_Colors.jpg?1372163346"" src="""" style="""" title=""RJClip Colors""/></p>
<h2>How do we make them?</h2>
<p>The RJClip is made with a state-of-the-art 3D manufacturing system.  Our vendor, Anubis3D, can produce the RJClip in a rainbow of colours in a medical grade nylon 12 material.  We are proud to say the RJClip is invented, designed and ""Made in Canada"".  We think this is one of the best things about our product. The biggest advantage to 3D manufacturing is the ability to have the RJClips ready to send to you soon after the end of the campaign.</p>

<h2>What's in it for you? (the Perks)</h2>
<p>All our perks are about getting you RJClips in the quantities and colours of your choice. We will also provide customization to suit corporations or individuals looking to hand out personalized gifts. (Hint: trade show handouts).  <span style=""font-size: 1.5em;""><br/></span></p>

<h2>Are there risks?</h2>
<p>We do not foresee any risks at this time as our patent pending design for the RJClip has tested successfully on almost all occasions. That being said, we are still making minor design changes to make the RJClip the best it can be. If the RJClip(s) you receive do not work, we will either exchange your RJClips or refund your money.  </p>
<h2>Other Ways You Can Help</h2>
<p>We know it's not always possible to contribute funds. The best way you can help us otherwise is to pass this campaign to anyone you think would be interested, especially people who work with computers (network and office administrators, etc.).  </p>

Instead of spending time crimping a new RJ45 connector onto the cable or spending money to buy a new network cable, you can simply clip an RJClip onto the broken network head and continue to use the cable. The design and material of the RJClip ensures it lasts many times longer than the original clip.  As a result, it mimimizes waste and contributes to a greener way of life.
 
What colours does it come in?
The RJClip is currently available in Red, White, Black, Green, Yellow, and Blue.
 
How do we make them?
The RJClip is made with a state-of-the-art 3D manufacturing system.  Our vendor, Anubis3D, can produce the RJClip in a rainbow of colours in a medical grade nylon 12 material.  We are proud to say the RJClip is invented, designed and ""Made in Canada"".  We think this is one of the best things about our product. The biggest advantage to 3D manufacturing is the ability to have the RJClips ready to send to you soon after the end of the campaign.

What's in it for you? (the Perks)
All our perks are about getting you RJClips in the quantities and colours of your choice. We will also provide customization to suit corporations or individuals looking to hand out personalized gifts. (Hint: trade show handouts).  

Are there risks?
We do not foresee any risks at this time as our patent pending design for the RJClip has tested successfully on almost all occasions. That being said, we are still making minor design changes to make the RJClip the best it can be. If the RJClip(s) you receive do not work, we will either exchange your RJClips or refund your money.  
Other Ways You Can Help
We know it's not always possible to contribute funds. The best way you can help us otherwise is to pass this campaign to anyone you think would be interested, especially people who work with computers (network and office administrators, etc.).  
We greatly appreciate everybody's time, support, and contributions!",5.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>The fundraiser will use the funds to inject capital into the company that owns the patent and distribution rights of the technology, the company will then do the necessary research for the combination of the two technologies.

How This Exfoliator Works, Watch Please!


The most Effective, Simple & Beautiful Tool for Home exfoliation.

 (S.E.M.G.T) Technology
Laser Forged Edge - The coolest part about the tool is its patented laser forged smooth edge micro groove technology. Using a pre-calculated computer guided process, the laser machine cuts micro precision grooves into pieces of high quality stainless steel. Each stainless steel is cut individually to make sure the quality is uniformed for maximum exfoliation results. It makes the process extremely expensive, but you get quality when you pay for quality.

How Does S.E.T Work
The Patented tool was made to glide with nothing but water. 

It does not cut or harm the user in anyway.
It glides smoothly off your skin.


Replacement Blades (Forget Them)
SET will save you time and money. - Cost Effective Exfoliation.
The smooth edge blade on the exfoliator never needs sharpening or replacement, it was meant to last and last and last. It does not rust since its made out of extremely high-quality stainless steel. 
How To Use S.E.T
Simply at a 90 Degree Angle - Just Add Water and Glide.

Wet the face and body in the shower or the part you are exfoliating.
Target any spots which holds SKIN.

Warm water is recommended.
Glide the tool at a 90 degree angle.
Give it 3-5 gentle strokes per spot.
Note that the face will produce more clay-like dirt since its most exposed.
If you feel the tool is too smooth, flip it and use the other side of the blade.

Importance of Effective Exfoliation
New skin cells are created in the skin's lower layer, the dermis. Over time, cells migrate to the surface of the skin and become more acidic. During their 30-day journey, they die and become saturated with keratin. Keratin is important because it protects the skin from outside elements. Exfoliation removes the outer 
layer to reveal the newer skin beneath. This shedding of the outer layer
 unclogs pores, keeps skin clean, and helps reduce acne outbreaks.

Only The Best Use S.E.T 

S.E.T exfoliator tools are used by thousands of home users world-wide, they have been recently adopted by top seven star luxury spas such as Jumeirah and The Mandarin Oriential Spa and also used in hospitals before surgery.

perfected and tested our current exfoliator. Lab-tested and proven by doctors, users and some of the world's top skin-care specialists. We're now
raising $110,000, which will allow us to produce a future new and improved version!
A version that implements healing technology such as UVB light and other non-invasive skin technologies. This version will help to not only increase exfoliation results, but aid in healing skin as well. In return
for your early support, you'll be the one and only exclusive club of funders to get our limited edition exfoliator. Designed only for Indiegogo!
Schedule of execution phase (only if our campaign meets or exceeds):
1st month – Creating a beautiful limited edition exfoliator for our backers.

2nd month – Sending out the limited edition exfoliators to our backers.

3rd-5th month – Extended Research and Development For SET version 2.

5th-7mth month – Final Testing and Lab Tests of SET version 2.

7th-12th month – Mass Production of SET version 2.
Schedule of production for the second version is TBA, the above schedule is just a guideline. The second version of the exfoliator is still a very long way from production. We need to get the implementation of the new technology perfect. The limited edition perk production can only start if our funds meet or exceed a certain amount or orders of up to at least 1000 units. If for some reason that does not happen, we will send out our regular S.E.M.G.T exfoliators to our backers depending on how much is raised.
The fundraiser will use the funds to inject capital into the company that owns the patent and distribution rights of the technology, the company will then do the necessary research for the combination of the two technologies. S.E.M.G.T + N.I.S.T (smooth edge micro groove technology + non invasive skin technology). The injection of capital is done by buying a small share in the company. How much share bought is at the discretion of the fundraiser.Marketing Video

<p>My name is Monet Trail.  I’m 42 and I’m kicking breast cancer’s ass!  I’ve had the cancer removed and I’m making it through chemo. But since my mom’s adopted, I decided to have the test done and it turns out I tested positive for the cancer gene – which means there’s a good chance the cancer will return.  Rather than dealing with this sh*t again, I’ve decided to have a double mastectomy and a hysterectomy.  If it were only me, I’d be grateful just to be surviving.  But I’m a single mom and I have a beautiful 15 year old daughter who deserves to enjoy this amazing time in her life.</p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/804566/pictures/full/20130511112655-monethair.png?1368296820"" src="""" style="""" title=""Me...Before, Now and ???""/></p>
<p>I turn 43 on May 23<sup>rd</sup> and I just realized what I really want for my birthday this year is the ability (on the day’s that I do feel good) to pick up and do something fun with my daughter – whether it’s dinner at Outback, a trip to the mall or a weekend at the beach which is just a 2 hour drive away. I want to grab those moments when I feel good and create happy experiences and memories with my daughter. I’ll try doing this no matter what, but the reality is money is tight and while I’m lucky because I’ve worked hard my entire life, disability and insurance doesn’t quite cover our living expenses so any splurges mean added stress and guilt because the money has to come from somewhere. </p>
<p>I have to admit it’s hard for me to do this because I hate asking for help.  But I’ve been through enough now to know that life is short and my pride is nothing compared to spending an afternoon having fun and laughing with my daughter. If I can’t ask for help now, when will I ever have the nerve to swallow my pride and ask for help?  So I’m closing my eyes, saying a secret prayer, crossing my fingers, and jumping into the deep end of the IndieGoGo pool and ultimately asking for the crowd’s help to create a “<strong>GUILT-FREE FUN FUND”</strong> for me and my daughter. </p>

<p><strong>Two years ago, at the age of 22, I got a herniated disc injury…</strong></p>

<p><strong>The back pain started as numbing annoyance in my lower back and right leg and rapidly spread to my other leg. Eight month later I couldn’t get up of my bed because the pain was just too much.</strong></p>
<p><strong>I was crippled.</strong> I couldn’t move too much so I obviously left sports. I could not be seated still for too long without unbearable pain, hence I was fired from my office job.  My mother started suffering from epileptic attacks before all this even happened, so to be unemployed was not an option. I left most of the university studies to get a full time job to support her along with the rest of the family.</p>
<p><strong>Living with everyday with this pain broke my life</strong> in other aspects as well: Somehow I get sick a lot, my everyday smiling  and laughing self almost disappeared and my girlfriend left me because of that.

<p>I’ve decided to end this once and for all, <strong>surgery is the only option for me now. All the other treatments have failed me and the rest are too expensive here in Argentina and less reliable.</strong></p>

I firmly believe that the thing we are forced to deal with forge our life ALWAYS IN THE BEST WAY. Most of the people I admire have archived they greater masterpieces because, not despite, of the struggle with very real challenges.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>My name is Lexis. I am a Pomeranian. My forever family found me at Small Dog Rescue three years ago and I love them very much for saving me and protecting me. Last year Mom was diagnosed with stage four breast cancer which went to her bones and we were all very afraid that we would lose her. Her wonderful doctors tried a new combination of chemotherapy and she began to get better. In July the doctors told us that we probably wouldn't have her for the coming Christmas and here she was with her hair growing back, smiling again and nearly back to her old happy self. With one letter from Amerihealth our lives were changed for the worse. The insurance company found a way to take back the hundreds of thousands of dollars they had paid for mom's life saving treatements by calling her cancer a pre-existing condition. Even though she appealed it three times we still ended up with no help from anywhere. Every where mom and dad turned for help there was none. Dad works really hard and has a good job but ends just are not meeting. Utilities are always getting turned off, people taking her car, sheriff's officers coming to inventory our belongings it is all very scary. We almost lost our house but mom and dad were able to get a mortgage modification to stop the foreclosure. They did lose a beloved family businesss called hangar 84 which was a concert venue where mom enjoyed cooking homemade meals for the touring bands and supporting music in the community. Summer camp was very popular and this summer mom really missed the kids and the music. She needs hormone therapy pills and a bone juice treatment once a month so we can keep her around with us. It is hard to pay for treatments, payment arrangements and normal household bills each month. Any donation at all will help. XOXO Lexis.</h3>

<h3>A Mission that means The End of Obesity</h3>
<p><strong>“We treat our cars better than our bodies”</strong>, says <strong>ibodi</strong> CEO Phil Walker.  “Because our cars come with an owner’s manual, and because of that manual we know exactly what the car needs.  <strong>ibodi</strong> is the manual for the human body and is the most complete and efficient program ever created based on human physiology”. </p>
<p><em><strong>Watch the video and see why the obesity crisis will not be solved with a pill, diet, or surgery.  These pseudo solutions do not address how the human body is designed. (Make sure to scroll down for before and after photos!)<br/></strong></em></p>
<p>Phil is living proof.  The 48 year-old former S&amp;P 500 executive has lost 65 pounds of body fat on the program. </p>
<p>The obesity crisis is currently costing $174 Billion per year, and Type 2 Diabetes is on a staggering rise.  According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, there are currently 17 million diagnosed diabetics in the US, and an estimated 7 million undiagnosed, with 79 million pre-diabetics in the pipeline.  The implications to the healthcare system and the national economy could be devastating.</p>
<p><strong>ibodi</strong> will soft launch by introducing a revolutionary nutrition line on Indiegogo.  Products and Perks are offered at a deep discount and the proceeds will be used toward completing the company's initial capital raise.  <strong>ibodi</strong>, who is also a member of <a href=""http://www.s.co/search/content/ibodi?f%5B0%5D=bundle%3Astartup_company&amp;retain-filters=1"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Start Up America</a>, is also considering an equity crowdfunding campaign in the Spring of 2013.</p>

<p><strong>ibodi Greens</strong> - The antioxidants of 20 servings of fruits and vegetables in one little scoop.  Be honest, do you really eat enough veggies?</p>
<p><strong>ibodi Multi Vitamin</strong> - Bioavailable nutrients that every cell in your body needs.</p>

<p><strong>ibodi</strong> recently announced their spokesman Ron Brown, who won a gold medal in the LA Olympics and set the world record in the 4x100 relay with Carl Lewis.  Ron then joined the LA Rams and was the fastest man in the NFL, twice.  Ron joined the <strong>ibodi</strong> team because of the amazing program results, whole body approach of nutrition, and sprint based technology which anyone can do. </p>
<p>The exercise component was developed by world class sprint coach Phil Campbell M.S., M.A., ACSM-CPT, FACHE and Certified, American College of Sports Medicine CPT.  Phil has spent the last 20 years making Olympic athletes and NFL football stars faster.  His discoveries over the years led to an easy to follow, machine-based, program that gets 40 and 50 year olds burning fat as if they were in their 20’s again.  If you can sit down and peddle, you can do this exercise.  There are three different machines that have been specially programmed for this breakthrough 20 minute exercise.  The first developed was a semi-recumbent bike seen below (available in Perk 7). </p>

<p>It may look like bikes you have seen at your local gym, but don't be fooled.  First of all, the positioning on this bike actually emulates a running sprint position.  The unique programming is designed to work the fast twitch muscle fibers of the legs, and <strong>there lies the game changer</strong>.  Much like how lifting weights increases bone density, exercising fast twitch muscle fibers specifically increases lean muscle mass and burns fat like crazy.  This new technology will be a game changer for the entire fitness industry.</p>
<p>A clinical study concluded that the program achieved an average body fat reduction of 31% in just 8 weeks along with amazing improvements in cholesterol and blood pressure levels.  A nurse that participated in the study saw her bad cholesterol go from 270 to 190.  A physician in the study was quoted as saying ""This program could potentially save Medicare millions by reducing obesity and reducing the need for cholesterol-lowering Statin drugs (a $14 billion dollar per year class of drugs) and reducing the number of diabetics and Metabolic Syndrome patients on Medicare"".  <strong>It even increased skin thickness 7.1% making skin smoother and filling in wrinkles</strong>. </p>
<p><strong>ibodi</strong> will open its first 3-4 locations in California and then expand nationally using a franchising model.  “We expect our data to be so conclusive that eventually health insurance companies will see the financial benefit of paying for memberships” says Walker.  People can join the company newsletter by participating in the Indiegogo campaign at any level.  If successful, the company is also considering using equity-crowdfunding (issuing stock) in early 2013 to complete their initial capital raise.</p>

<br/><div>When people are feeling isolated, disconnected and alone, they are most likely to relapse. If they are traveling, it's the middle of the night, or they are unable to realistically connect with their support system, they need to be able to reach out to someone that can help them.<div>
<div>
<p></p>With an estimated 20 million individuals in the United States living in recovery, our goal and belief is that Sober Chat will save lives, families and relationships by providing that instant support network to help people stay in recovery . <p></p>
<p>Sober Chat is the first ever location-sensitive mobile social application designed specifically for people in recovery. It’s a way for people who share that common goal of staying in recovery by instantly connect to get the support they need.

<p>We have an initial design completed for the Sober Chat app. We need your help to raise the funds to finish building the app, and then to generate widespread awareness of this valuable and perhaps life-saving tool. When we launch there will be an instant community of support available for anyone in recovery feeling isolated, alone and at risk of using again.</p>
<p>Please make a contribution and help us reach our goal of saving lives and keep people in recovery and free from the insidious grasp of addiction. Thank you for your time, contributions and help spreading the word about Sober Chat.<br/></p>

<li>Fund getting the app fully built and having ongoing support for the app from our team of developers</li> <li>Fund a professional Public Relations and Marketing campaign to raise awareness of this potentially life-saving tool to people and providers in the recovery community across the United States </li> <li>Spread the word through your own online and in person social media connections to anyone and everyone you can. </li> </ul>
<p></p> <p> </p>
<h3>The impact of your contribution</h3> <p></p>At some point in their lives, it is highly likely that everyone will be affected in some way by this insidious disease known as addiction.  This tool will help those who have made the choice to live a clean and sober life to stay in recovery, especially in times of crisis when they are most likely to relapse: late at night, when alone and isolated, and when presented with extreme emotional distress.<p></p>
<p>Some people just don't respond well to traditional treatments, and are struggling with sobriety on their own. Sober Chat can also help them have the support network to keep them from making decisions that can jeopardize their sobriety.</p>
<p>There are countless personal stories we could share of people we know relapsing and even dying from this disease because at that point of temptation, isolation or fear, they didn't feel they had their support network available.  Our goal is to make sure that network is always there, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.</p>
<p> </p>
<p></p> <p> </p>
<h3>What is the risk?</h3> <p> There is always risk in developing for-profit mobile applications. We want to be clear about that. There is always the chance an app will not resonate with its audience.  However, every expert we've spoken with in the fields of mobile technology, mental health and addiction, as well as people living with addiction in the sober community are all immediately on board once they hear about the app and see the design for it.  We've also taken the time to speak with public relations and marketing experts who agree there is a need for the product and that they anticipate a great response.</p>
<p>In addition, Ken Seeley, a certified Interventionist featured regularly on A&amp;E's critically acclaimed television show ""Intervention"" has not only invested his own funds to help get us to this point, but has endorsed this project because he believes it will help people stay clean and sober.

</p><p><u>Short Summary</u></p>
<p>Hello and thank you for taking time to read about CaNo
Collection! Our names are Camille Smith and Noel Thompson and we are both 20
year old college students. Camille is from Columbus, Ohio and Noel is from
Detroit, Michigan and we both are early on into our junior year at Eastern
Michigan University. As enthusiasts of hair care and hair extensions, we want
to create and expand a business where we can share what we know and what we’ve
learned in the world of hair with consumers worldwide. We are very passionate
about healthy hair, and as newly natural young women, we have discovered many
ways to care for our hair through research and trial and error. We also have a
passion for hair extensions, and throughout the many years we have worn hair
extensions, we have discovered great quality hair. We plan to promote extensions, not only for the look, style and confidence that they give, but more so for protective styling.</p><p>  As young ladies who believe that when you look good, you feel even better we plan to give back by donating hand made wigs to people who suffer from the after affects of cancer/chemo therapy, alopecia areata, psoriasis of the scalp and any other unfortunate cause of hair loss. We have also done research, and will continue to find tips to help soothe some of those annoying side affects that can cause a woman to be self conscious or  hold them back from unleashing their inner beauty to its full potential.<br/></p>
<p><span>  Since we are in college and on campus,
we want to provide the best for our college peers who may be interested in
wearing great quality hair but have never really been able to afford it. We
understand how it feels to be in school and having to choose between what we
want and what we actually need. With that being said, after many hours of careful planning, we have devised a way to price our
hair extensions to be both affordable, as well as providing hair care tips so
customers will have the chance to get the most out of the money they choose to spend with us. This campaign is very
important to us because it will help us meet the start-up goals that we need and
we will be able to bring forth the very best in products to our customers. As a
contributor, you will help us achieve many of our start-up goals, which we will
be exceptionally grateful for and you will also help us get a great start on
the company that we plan to create and share with the world.</span></p>
<p><u>What we
need &amp; what you get</u></p>
<p><span>  To start off, we will need
$1,500 so that we can begin to purchase the Indian Remy hair extensions. The
vendor that we are purchasing hair from prices their wholesale Indian Remy hair
according to the length. We only plan to start with 14” bundles which are $18
per bundle. The vendor requires that we purchase a minimum of 20 bundles in
order to place an order. That will also include shipping fees as well as
membership fees, so that will be about $390. The rest of the contributions will

<br/></div>","Short Summary
Hello and thank you for taking time to read about CaNo
Collection! Our names are Camille Smith and Noel Thompson and we are both 20
year old college students. Camille is from Columbus, Ohio and Noel is from
Detroit, Michigan and we both are early on into our junior year at Eastern
Michigan University. As enthusiasts of hair care and hair extensions, we want
to create and expand a business where we can share what we know and what we’ve
learned in the world of hair with consumers worldwide. We are very passionate
about healthy hair, and as newly natural young women, we have discovered many
ways to care for our hair through research and trial and error. We also have a
passion for hair extensions, and throughout the many years we have worn hair
extensions, we have discovered great quality hair. We plan to promote extensions, not only for the look, style and confidence that they give, but more so for protective styling.  As young ladies who believe that when you look good, you feel even better we plan to give back by donating hand made wigs to people who suffer from the after affects of cancer/chemo therapy, alopecia areata, psoriasis of the scalp and any other unfortunate cause of hair loss. We have also done research, and will continue to find tips to help soothe some of those annoying side affects that can cause a woman to be self conscious or  hold them back from unleashing their inner beauty to its full potential.
  Since we are in college and on campus,
we want to provide the best for our college peers who may be interested in
wearing great quality hair but have never really been able to afford it. We
understand how it feels to be in school and having to choose between what we
want and what we actually need. With that being said, after many hours of careful planning, we have devised a way to price our
hair extensions to be both affordable, as well as providing hair care tips so
customers will have the chance to get the most out of the money they choose to spend with us. This campaign is very
important to us because it will help us meet the start-up goals that we need and
we will be able to bring forth the very best in products to our customers. As a
contributor, you will help us achieve many of our start-up goals, which we will
be exceptionally grateful for and you will also help us get a great start on
the company that we plan to create and share with the world.
What we
need & what you get
  To start off, we will need
$1,500 so that we can begin to purchase the Indian Remy hair extensions. The
vendor that we are purchasing hair from prices their wholesale Indian Remy hair
according to the length. We only plan to start with 14” bundles which are $18
per bundle. The vendor requires that we purchase a minimum of 20 bundles in
order to place an order. That will also include shipping fees as well as
membership fees, so that will be about $390. The rest of the contributions will
be used in purchasing packaging materials as well as cover any advertising
costs. We will gradually add more lengths of Indian Remy hair extensions with hopes to expand to more illustrious textures such as Brazilian, Malaysian, Peruvian and other virgin and raw textures. When
we see that our small business is moving forward people will naturally become more and
more interested thus fulfilling our dreams and the hopes of all of those who invest and believe in said dream. 
Example:
20 bundles  of the Indian Remy extensions will
cost about $18 per bundle to purchase wholesale. That is about $360 for 20
bundles of the Indian Remy hair texture in ONE length (14 inches).
The average amount of bundles that a
person may use is about 3 to 4 bundles.
That means 20 bundles of hair can be
bought by about 5 to 6 people and we would have to continue to purchase more
bundles of hair wholesale to meet the needs of consumers and to be consistent.
More of what
is contributed to us will be spent on great products for the care of the hair
extensions, including, weft sealant, argan oil, etc. We will also offer our
customers custom coloring at an extra price so hair dye would be another
product that would be covered from the contributions that we receive from you.
We also plan
to set up a simple website that is easy to navigate and will allow for
stress-free ordering of our products.
Perks:
There will
be perks to contributing and supporting our dream! It can be anything from
discounts on hair and products, great and researched advice on healthy hair
care, and gifts! And of course, you will stay updated on the progress of our
business (we will NEVER forget those who’ve helped or even just supported).
If we don’t

while receiving I.V. treatments or infusions. <p></p>
<p>Kylie's backpack 
couldn't be just any backpack.  Because of the fasionista that she is, 
these would have to be colorful, gender specific, and awesome.  She went
 to work and with the help from her parents designed a backpack.</p>
<p>The
 design incorporated an I.V. pole with a drip bag protection cage.  Kids
 want to move around and we can't risk the Medicine bags getting 
punctured or compressed.  This cage is customizable with different 
shapes, like hearts, peace signs, etc.  This also makes treatment less 
scary.  I.V. poles are very intimidating to young children.  The 
protection cage is also removable and can be replaced with a child's 
choice of design.

Medical studies show that majority of people need supplemental vitamins and minerals. However, several recent reports have indicated that many common multivitamins do not work (*).We are a team of scientists who have discovered and created a solution to this problem.Why common multivitamins do not work? There are three main reasons why common multivitamins do not work:A solution
BT is a new daily vitamin regimen that gives your
body the nutritional benefits that multivitamins are supposed to deliver, but
can’t.  Though convenient, all-in-one multivitamins combine ingredients that either can’t be digested together or actually
cancel one another out. The net effect
is sub-optimal nutrition and negative impact on mood and energy.  Developed by scientists, BT
groups ingredients by their synergy and provides supplements for the body’s three unique daily phases:  Energy in the Morning.  Sustained nutrition during the Day.  Relaxation in the Evening. BT accounts for many interactions between vitamins and minerals as well as for interactions between vitamins and minerals with meals commonly eaten at the specific time of day.BT is complete and effectiveIn BT three formulas together contain all the micronutrients that your body 
needs every day: vitamins, minerals, omega-3 fish oil, CoQ10, Cal/Mag, 
and herbal/fruit blend of antioxidants. All the ingredients are 
grouped according to the synergy between them. When using BT you save money and get better results compared to taking these five 
products individually!Who needs BT?
BT was created for adults, both men and women. It would benefit anyone who wants to feel more energetic and balanced during the day and more relaxed at night. BT is for busy people who want to feed their bodies well, but do not have time to do all the required planning and cooking.Our StoryOur company was founded in 2011 by Natalia Lukina.

<h3><span><b>Why a cookbook? How does this relate to longevity?</b></span></h3>
<p>Most importantly, we want to draw attention to an overlooked problem whose time has come: aging.  In recent decades, we have begun to understand how to use changes in nutrition and lifestyle to extend the healthiest years of life.  At the same time, findings in the lab have shown that it may someday be possible to greatly extend our maximum lifespan, and our quality of life as we age.  This could happen sooner than you might think!</p>
<p>Any ambition to live longer than the historical human maximum lifespan of ~120 years will require a complex approach, that is not yet fully understood.  It's possible that by modestly improving our health, and rolling back the clock using improvements to nutrition and lifestyle, such as those to be outlined in the Longevity Cookbook, we may live long enough to reap the benefits of revolutionary interventions that are currently still in the lab.  With this thinking in mind, in the book we'll outline some of the most promising experiments that are currently underway or being proposed. </p>
<p>If we really want to live longer, we can’t concentrate all our prospects in one place. Our goal in the Longevity Cookbook is to tell you about many of the promising available options that could one day lead to huge changes in how we age, and to bring them to life.</p>

This chance is slim, and we will be keeping everyone up to date on the progress of the project by posting frequent updates on the website. Any possible delay won’t come as a surprise and will be addressed by outsourcing additional specialists as necessary.

The Intercultural Outreach Initiative is working to replace
mercury filled thermometers and blood pressure devices with safer, more modern
equipment on Isabela in the Galapagos.
What is the issue, problem or challenge?
In Isabela, Galapagos mercury based equipment is still commonly
used. Mercury is a heavy metal that accumulates in the body and can cause a
range of health problems including brain, kidney and digestive damage. Mercury
based thermometers and blood pressure devices have the potential to break and
spill. The liquid mercury evaporates easily into the air, even at room
temperature, to form mercury vapor creating a dangerous inhalation hazard. 
How will the project solve this problem?
By supplying the hospital on Isabela with alternatives to
mercury based thermometers the risk of detrimental effects of mercury poisoning
on Isabela’s citizens will decrease exponentially.


What We Need & What You Get

 

We are aiming to raise three automatic blood
pressure monitors at the price of $126,66 each ($379,98 for three), two adult
oximeters $80,- each ($160.- for two) and one digital gun thermometer at the price
of $140,- making it a total of $679,98 for all the equipment. An additional
$120,- is needed for transport and packaging bringing the final total to $799,98. These medical devices will be used in the only health center available on Isabela island.
If we don't reach our goal of $800,- we will use what was donated to buy as much equipment as the total donation allows. 
   The Impact Replacing this outdated and dangerous equipment on Isabela, Galapagos is an important step in the work to modernize the hospital and improve the islands healthcare for all its citizens.    Risks & Challenges It will be a challenge getting the equipment safely from the mainland to the island of Isabela as logistics from Ecuador mainland are always a challenge. The Galapagos Islands are 800 miles off the coast of south America in the Pacific Ocean.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<h3>KATHY’S STORY:</h3>
<h3>As told by a friend;</h3>
<h3>I’ve known Kathy for some seven years now maybe more, this is her story put together as best as I can, my accounts come first hand or directly from her. I know that she wouldn’t ask for help. So my plan is to do it for her.</h3>
<p>Let’s get Kathy a prosthetic; and some help;</p>
<p>   Kathy, through no fault of her own is unemployed; and is now considered handicapped; she has lost her arm just below her shoulder to cancer, she has endured four separate amputation / rebuild surgery’s attempting to save the limb and stop the spread of the cancer; all but the last had failed.</p>
<p>Divorced from a local businessman, shortly after having her second child, Kathy lost everything, yet still had the perseverance and the wherewithal to raise her</p>
<p>two children alone, starting a small antique shop with her mom she was able to made ends meet for a while; finally securing a home for herself and her children, but tragedy struck again when Kathy was diagnosed with a rare form of melanoma.  </p>
<p>The cancer, an extremely rare growth the Doctor's had initially thought was a cyst, had formed on her wrist, the doctors treated it as such but this course of treatment sent the tendrils of cancer further into the arm, discovering their error she underwent surgery to remove the cancer and rebuild the arm.

KATHY’S STORY:
As told by a friend;
I’ve known Kathy for some seven years now maybe more, this is her story put together as best as I can, my accounts come first hand or directly from her. I know that she wouldn’t ask for help. So my plan is to do it for her.
Let’s get Kathy a prosthetic; and some help;
   Kathy, through no fault of her own is unemployed; and is now considered handicapped; she has lost her arm just below her shoulder to cancer, she has endured four separate amputation / rebuild surgery’s attempting to save the limb and stop the spread of the cancer; all but the last had failed.
Divorced from a local businessman, shortly after having her second child, Kathy lost everything, yet still had the perseverance and the wherewithal to raise her
two children alone, starting a small antique shop with her mom she was able to made ends meet for a while; finally securing a home for herself and her children, but tragedy struck again when Kathy was diagnosed with a rare form of melanoma.  
The cancer, an extremely rare growth the Doctor's had initially thought was a cyst, had formed on her wrist, the doctors treated it as such but this course of treatment sent the tendrils of cancer further into the arm, discovering their error she underwent surgery to remove the cancer and rebuild the arm. This was endured four separate times in rapid succession in order to catch up with and arrest the spread of the melanoma. She would no sooner heal from one surgery then be into another surgery again. All the while raising her two children, as well as trying within a poor economy to make the business run successfully.
 Kathy’s a fighter, and made it through, the business failed, but she sold for enough to secure her home and raise the children for a while; but as a result of not being able to work full time due to her surgeries, amputation and caring for the children at home she is not eligible for social security disability insurance, unemployment or welfare. Determined to make it and provide for herself and her children, she has taken everything she could put together financially and tried to improve her home with the thought that maybe she could if necessary either lease her home while maintaining a room or rent the rooms while the kids are in college, this way she would have a small income and a place to live in the event the cancer returned and the children would have a home.

<h3>What we are about</h3>
<p>Dear friends, my name is Lucian Mircescu and I am the manager of Aurora Baicoi Rugby Club, a children rugby association. Our project deals with rebuilding an abandoned soccer venue and transforming it into <strong>a children-only sports zone</strong>. Together with our rugby agenda, we are happy to promote sport activities in general as long as we get children physically active.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What we need &amp; where we want to get</h3>
<p>In detail, we want to aquire the <strong>building materials</strong> necessary for repairing the aforementioned sports grounds. At the moment we lack basic utilities such as electricity, heating, running water and therefore there are no showers or usable locker rooms. </p>
<p>The 6500$ that we are humbly asking are obviously insufficient for a complete overhaul, but they are enough to have functional facilities and thus get us through the winter. The actual work will be done by our <strong>network of volunteers</strong> made up mainly by our children's parents. Therefore every 10$ or 20$ will make a huge a difference for us and it will get us closer to our goal.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>There are currently 80 children playing rugby on our grounds and we are also aiming to bring pupils from two nearby primary schools so that they can have their <strong>physical education classes</strong> on the much safer grass pitch. Repairing this sports venue would make a huge impact in the life our community since there currently is no outdoor space for children to play sports. That is to say one with safe, hygienic and generally decent and <strong>free of charge</strong> sports facilities.</p>

Institutions that are designed to care for the elderly and improve their health can actually make them sicker.  The focus has shifted away from the individual needs of residents and their families.

<p><span style=""font-size: 1.5em;"">The problem with California midwifery law</span></p>
<p>In California, licensed midwives are technically required by law to to secure supervision from a physician in order to legally practice. While the spirit of the law may appear to inspire collaboration between midwives and physicians, this is not the case.</p>
<p>Physician supervision is unattainable for midwives in California. Physicians are unwilling or, because of malpractice insurance limitations, unable to provide the required supervision. The result?<strong> Licensed midwives providing home and birth center births are currently unable to comply with California law.</strong></p>
<p>Until now, this law has remained unenforced. However, a new bill (SB 304) would move enforcement of licensees from the California Medical Board to the Department of Justice. As we understand it, this bill was designed to tighten enforcement of dangerous prescription writing by a tiny minority of physicians. <strong>However, this legislation could have the unintended consequence of opening up midwives to enforcement of the existing physician supervision regulations.</strong></p>
<p>Even if this SB 304 does not pass, one of our key allies - the executive director of the CA Medical Board - has mysteriously taken early retirement. Some have suggested she was forced out in part because of her support for home birth.<strong> A new executive director could quickly call for enforcement of physician supervision - which would criminalize most homebirth in CA. </strong></p>
<p>California, Louisiana, Delaware and Arkansas are the only states where the laws governing the relationship between midwives and physicians fail to comply with the standards of practice outlined by National Association of Certified Professional Midwives.</p>
<h2>The Truth About Licensed Midwives In California</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Licensed midwives are trained as experts in out-of-hospital birth and are autonomous providers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Licensed midwives are specifically trained to recognize abnormal or emergent conditions needing expert help outside their scope.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Licensed midwives have a plan for consultation and referral to appropriate physicians when such conditions arise.</p>

Honor Thy Midwife!
Mothers, fathers, partners, and grandparents - we invite you to honor the midwife who cared for you during pregnancy, birth, and the early weeks of your newborn’s life.
For a contribution of any level, we will list the name of your midwife (and your name, if you choose) on our Honor Thy Midwife page at the California Families for Access to Midwives site. We will also give your midwife a well-deserved shout-out on social media.
Your donation will help to fund critical efforts to ensure that homebirth midwifery is still available in California. Read on for details! (the rest of the Indiegogo campaign spells out the details)
To honor your midwife:
1) Make a contribution at any level.
2) Leave us a comment** with the name of your midwife to be honored. If you would like us to include your name, please let us know - otherwise, we’ll mark it an anonymous. If you have your midwife’s e-mail handy, let us know that, too, so we can tell your midwife about the honor! ** After you make your contribution, return to the FreeOurMidwives campaign page and click on the ""comments"" tab to add your midwife's name.
We will list your midwife on our Honor Thy Midwife page within 2 days of your donation.
The problem with California midwifery law
In California, licensed midwives are technically required by law to to secure supervision from a physician in order to legally practice. While the spirit of the law may appear to inspire collaboration between midwives and physicians, this is not the case.
Physician supervision is unattainable for midwives in California. Physicians are unwilling or, because of malpractice insurance limitations, unable to provide the required supervision. The result? Licensed midwives providing home and birth center births are currently unable to comply with California law.
Until now, this law has remained unenforced. However, a new bill (SB 304) would move enforcement of licensees from the California Medical Board to the Department of Justice. As we understand it, this bill was designed to tighten enforcement of dangerous prescription writing by a tiny minority of physicians. However, this legislation could have the unintended consequence of opening up midwives to enforcement of the existing physician supervision regulations.
Even if this SB 304 does not pass, one of our key allies - the executive director of the CA Medical Board - has mysteriously taken early retirement. Some have suggested she was forced out in part because of her support for home birth. A new executive director could quickly call for enforcement of physician supervision - which would criminalize most homebirth in CA. 
California, Louisiana, Delaware and Arkansas are the only states where the laws governing the relationship between midwives and physicians fail to comply with the standards of practice outlined by National Association of Certified Professional Midwives.
The Truth About Licensed Midwives In California


Licensed midwives are trained as experts in out-of-hospital birth and are autonomous providers.


Licensed midwives are specifically trained to recognize abnormal or emergent conditions needing expert help outside their scope.


Licensed midwives have a plan for consultation and referral to appropriate physicians when such conditions arise.

What we are doing to create change in California
We are up against a huge foe. ACOG - the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists - has launched massive and well-funded campaigns in other states to reduce access to out-of-hospital midwifery.

<h3>My husband is my rock, the love of my life; always the optimistic and looking for ways to help others in need.  Now he needs help, and I feel so helpless that I am unable to provide it.</h3>
<p>My husband was injured at work in 2011, and sought medical assistance.  Unfortunately, worker's compensation would not agree to send him to the right doctor.  They also refused to pay him benefits for being injured.  My husband tried to return to work to support us, but his injury is so severe that they sent him home with an order not to return until it was fixed.</p>
<p>Now, almost a year later, we are still fighting with insurance companies and worker's compensation to pay for the tests and treatment my husband needs to get back to his old self.  He is in so much pain every day - he can no longer sleep in our bed because he has to sit up, and he can't lift a gallon of milk.  There is something wrong with my husband, but something that I believe can be fixed.  I just don't have the money to pay for him to see a doctor to prove to the insurance companies and worker's compansion that something is wrong.  It is an incredibly frustrating situation, and I feel powerless.</p>
<p>We have a lawyer who is supposed to be helping us, but it is a very slow process and nothing seems to be happening.  Currently, we are in the process of losing our home.</p>
<p>This whole situation is devasating to us, because it could be fixed if only my husband could see a doctor.  The two of us are only 25 years old, but this has affected us in so many ways.  Our dreams of owning a home, starting a family, and helping rescue dogs have been dashed.</p>
<p>It is very hard to ask for help, but any help would be greatly appreciated.  Any donations will go to finding a doctor for my husband and getting his back and shoulder injury evaluated.  Any extra money raised will help us to get back on our feet - finding a new home and a new job for my husband.  If Joe can get his injury fixed, we can get back to our lives and return to helping others.</p>
<p>If you can't donate, it would be so wonderful if you could spread the word.  Any little bit helps!  </p>

<p>In the summer of 2006, Amelia was diagnosed with Hepatitis C. Hep C is a virus that can damage your liver. In Amelia the virus has decided to stay and hang out. It's like the in-laws who won't leave your house after the holidays. Only this is much more serious.</p>
<p>Amelia received treatment with interferon, a drug that, in addition to its healing potential, also gave her some great side effects like flu-like symptoms, some memory/cognitive loss, and depression. </p>
<p>Her last liver biopsy showed that the interferon wasn't helping her anymore and the side effects outweighed the option of continuing.</p>
<p>She is currently on an interferon sabbatical, waiting for a new drug. While she was receiving treatment, the American Liver Association helped pay for her treatments. </p>
<p>Amelia's story doesn't end here...</p>
<p>A couple of weeks ago, while not sitting around feeling sorry for herself, Amelia saved one of her cats from running out of the house.  In doing so she broke her ankle on both sides (she likes to do things thoroughly). She broke the tibia and the fibula closest to her ankle and had ORIF (Open Reduction Internal Fixation) surgery to help her ankle heal. </p>
<p>Her stitches will be removed this week.  She will be in a cast for 12 weeks and unable to put any weight on her foot during that time.  </p>
<p>In a relatively normal, every day life, this break would be annoying.  In Amelia's life with Hep C, no insurance, and no job, this is crushing. </p>
<p>I am asking for funding to pay for Amelia's mounting medical bills - just for her ankle.</p>
<p>She is without insurance and currently can't get it because of her pre-existing condition.  Obamacare will eventually help her but not until the pre-existing condition rule goes into effect next year.</p>
<p>All of the money raised in this campaign will go directly to Amelia to pay her medical bills. </p>
<p>If you can't afford to help at this time, please share this campaign with others. </p></span></span></span></span></div>","Why Amelia needs our help:

<p><strong>What is Palestine MMA?</strong></p>
<p>PMMA is a non-profit organization aimed at contributing to the growth and development of Martial Arts and Olympic sports for the children in Palestine. With this mission, PMMA strives to positively affect social development, health and education for Palestinians. </p>
<p><strong>What is this Volunteer Challenge exactly and what are we trying to achieve?</strong></p>
<p>PMMA is holding an international fundraising drive in which several teams of volunteers compete against one another in a spirit of friendship to support this great cause. The aim is to raise enough money to fund the opening of the Palestine MMA Gym in Ramallah this summer. There are teams in Abu Dhabi, Sydney, California, and us here in New Jersey! We are a very new and small team here in NJ and we hope to be fierce competitors -- Help us reach our goal and beyond.</p>
<p><strong>How much do we need to raise? The target goal is to raise $5,000...</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>but WAIT! Don't run away just yet. $5,000 may sound like a large number and you may think your dollars won't count, but they will!! Every single dollar sincerely counts and brings us closer to funding that gym over in Palestine this summer. Just think.. a few seconds put aside to donate just $5 or $10 can contribute to a new gym all the way over in Palestine for children to learn Martial Arts!</p>
<p>We will be doing other fundraising events in NJ such as a benefits concert, bake sale, and lottery fundraising, so our target goal has been set at $3,000 on this site, but that doesn't mean we have to stop there! =]</p>
<p><strong>Still can't contribute?</strong></p>
<p>IT'S OK! You can help in other ways. Simply help us get the word out and make some noise! You can:</p>
<ul>
<li>set a link on your social media page (facebook, twitter, etc…) directing your friends and family to our donations page</li>
<li>attend our benefits concert in May (keep your eyes out for more information)</li>
<li>send positive thoughts and wishes our way!</li>

<p><strong><br/></strong>Blue Hawaiian Cleanse is the first colon cleanser on the market with the natural and beneficial properties of coconut oil.  Coconut oil is a known agent for anti-viral, anti-fungal, and anti-bacterial.  Blue Hawaiian cleanse is a propriety blend of the absolute fienst herbs available.  With coconut as one of the ingredients, our clients are seeing incredible results in detoxifying and cleansing their digestive systems.</p>
<p>We have completed all of the testing, production and warehousing of this supplement and it is ready to ship directly to you!</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>The Book:</strong></p>
<p><strong><br/></strong>The book title was born one day talking with one of my clients.  He asked me if I had ever  heard how Elvis Presley died and how he had massive amounts of waste matter in his colon.  The KING was very constipated and this was the cause of his untimely death (The actual autopsy report is in the book!).  I don't mean to brag, but had I been available to Elvis during his reign, ""I Could Have Saved E.L.V.I.S.!""</p>
<p>As soon as I verified that he died from extreme constipation, I knew I had to educate the world about colon health.  70% of our immune system is in our colon.  We are only as happy and healthy as our colon is.  The average American consumes 70-80% processed foods in which our digestive system does not know how to break down naturally.  In return, the undigested matter gets lodged and stuck in the colon causing pain, bloating, constipation and toxic waste build up which can lead to illnesses and disease.</p>
<p>As a Indiegogo contributor, your copy of my book, ""I Could Have Saved E.L.V.I.S."" will come as a <em>limited, signed </em>edition!</p>
<p>I'm here to educate the world in a fun way with the book and share the Blue Hawaiian Cleanse so others can feel better.  Thanks for your pledge and I look forward to your good health.</p>

<p>Breath of My Heart Birth Place is a community-run birth center providing an walk-in prenatal care clinic, women's health, pregnancy, and birth services. We are staffed by midwives and our goal is serving families in the Espanola Valley. We are raising money to finish the renovation of a birth room at our office in Espanola, NM. Your donation will allow us to finish our renovations to provide a comfortable and safe place for women and families to welcome their new babies into this world. </p>
<h3>Who Are We?</h3>
<p>     The team that is developing Breath of my heart Birth Place (BMH) is a group of midwives, community members, families, community activists, and educators. We have been working together to develop our vision for BMH through strategic planning for the past two years. We have reached a pivotal moment in our dream; we are building a birth room!  </p>
<p>     The project so far has been supported by thousands of volunteer hours spent on planning, meetings, community out-reach, needs assessment and building construction.    We have begun our office space renovation to provide a birth room for moms and families in the Valley. Your financial  support will allow us to complete the project and make the birth suite available by the end of the summer.  </p>
<p>     The birth suite will include a birth tub in comfortable space for moms and families who are planning their birth with midwives.  The plan has been developed by an architect, the walls have been moved, and the electrical and plumbing is underway.  While the renovation project has  received small grants from supporting individuals we need to raise another $4000.00 in order to finish and furnish the room.</p>
<h3>Background and Intentions:</h3>
<div>
<div>Breath of my heart birth place is a community driven project with the goal of providing solutions to the issues facing women families and their babies in the Espanola valley. Health disparities and poor birth outcomes persist in our community due to many complex factors.  Many of the causes of these issues are addressed in our walk-in perinatal care clinic, homebirth services, and (soon) birth center through the community and culurally based care that our midwives provide.   We see the results of the tough beginning for many of the kids in our community as they grow up and have many struggles.  The BMH group is passionate in our belief that our community will find solutions to problems and meet the needs of our children given the appropriate resources.</div>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>     Our community is majority Hispanic and Native American population. Access to quality birth and midwifery care is very limited. The midwifery model of care is proven to address birth outcomes in so many ways, including reducing c-section rate and rate of preterm birth.  Breath of My Heart Birth Place was born out of the efforts of community members recovering their internal knowingness of birth. The moment of birth, when the family is forming or reforming, is an incredible window of opportunity for family empowerment.  The addition of a new baby brings an openness to change and a dynamism to our families. We want to support families to capitalize on this moment of dynamic change by providing meaningful midwifery care in a birth center setting.</p>
<p>     There have been many communities that have benefitted from this model of community care in New Mexico and other parts of the United States.  We have learned from our sister projects and will continue to invite their wisdom to help guide our efforts and support our community. </p>
<p>     New Mexico has a deep history and long roots of beautiful culture and spirituality, though we experience significant financial poverty we are rich in many other resources.  This combined with with an amazing high desert beautiful landscape have combined to earn New Mexico the title ""land of enchantment"".  We as a community are working hard to make better the issues that challenge our land and people. We believe that a healthy and empowered birth stregnthens parents and provides a strong start for our children.  This is our path to generational change; help us to provide these services that will impact families for generations. We truly appreciate your  support. </p>

<p>Originally, Teenage Tracker was simply called “I Hear You”. We just wanted to access each other’s phones at any given moment. After first trials, using a cloud server system and Peer to Peer connectivity, we soon saw there was much more scope and scalability for complex operations. Thereby allowing creation of many different products from this base platform.</p>
<p>For the past 6 months, the platform on which Teenage Tracker is based has in fact been written, studied, and rewritten several times until it was deemed stable and scalable to at least a few hundred thousand active users. This may be a little obsessive for a start up, but it is the corner stone to our business model.</p>
<p>Our IndieGoGo campaign is not just about the Teenage Tracking App and making it a commercial product. It is mainly about our Platform and about being able to create useful P2P /social interactive applications.  As many as can be conceived. Imagine it as a conveyer belt of niche apps.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>The goal is to fulfill the contract with a company of Professional Beta Testers. This will help us to find problems that may still be within Teenage Tracker and the whole Platform. This is a crucial step in developing any successful app or software.</p>
<p>Marketing capital: To make Teenage Tracker and the following applications a commercial success. Without proper marketing and advertising, no one will ever know the product is out there.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><a name=""whycrowdfunding"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a></p>
<p><img alt=""Why Crowd Funding"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://pureappstudio.com/indiegogo/new/why_crowd_funding.png"" src="""" style="""" title=""Why Crowd Funding""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>There are many ways to raise capital, the most common ones are: Friends &amp; Family, Bank loan or Private investors.<br/> But every form of raising start up capital comes with its own set of drawbacks. Crowd funding is the newest and most outrageous of all concepts but it is beautiful at the same time. Indeed, contributions can be made with out asking for any perk at all but let’s face it not many can resist the temptation of a great deal.</p>
<p><br/> And great deals they are, since they work both ways. Without the initial contributions, it would be a lot harder, if not impossible, to launch the product. Once the product is launched giving it out to our contributors comes at a negligible cost, and therefore everybody is happy. Meanwhile, let us examine our other options:-</p>
<p><br/> Family and friends are a great source but for 99% or more of the global population (including us) our ideas, dreams and passions are even bigger than the combined resources of our extended families. Not to mention they probably have their own big ideas.</p>
<p><br/> Banks are great but by far the most expensive route to take; placing unnecessary overhead upon the already limited cash flow. They are much less flexible and get heavy handed much quicker if things take that little bit longer than anticipated. Which is, in fact, just a part of life. If everything could always go to plan, financial risk would never be an issue.</p>
<p><br/> Private investors are our second best option. Great venture capitalists take many factors into account. The presentation, the numbers and trust must all be in place in all the correct quantities to make a deal. This can be an extremely long drawn out process just finding such a wonderful person that just fits in with the vision, the team and most importantly is prepared to provide the funding.</p>
<p align=""center""><img alt=""Why Crowd Funding"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://pureappstudio.com/indiegogo/new/extra/why_crowd_funding.png"" src="""" style="""" title=""Why Crowd Funding""/></p>
<p>Why Crowd Funding? Because it is by far, THE MOST COST EFFECTIVE FORM OF INVESTMENT for all concerned. Repayment is made in the form of our created intellectual property, which costs nothing extra to install on your phone, plus whatever level of perk was subscribed to if any was requested. Therefore, by paying everyone back in a non-monetary form, it means more of the financial capital is invested in our growth and none is allocated to high interest rates and balance repayments. There are some perks that will cost us a great deal but we have only promised those once we know we have a solid foundation to stand on.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>Without your support, it will be really hard to get to the stage where PureApp Studio's Platform and Teenage Tracker can be bug &amp; error free. We will not be able to deliver to all the people already believing in Teenage Tracker; actually waiting for the app to be there and start fully using all of its features.</p>
<p align=""center""><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><img alt=""Project Timeline"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://pureappstudio.com/indiegogo/new/extra/we_have_spent.png"" src="""" style="""" title=""Project Timeline""/></span></strong></p>
<p>We really ask for your consideration and help. As you can see we have the Teenage Tracker and the whole Platform there ready and set up in a Beta Stage. We have spent 6 months and over $15.000 in development. Have used all of our savings we had from previously working our day jobs. We now need your support as Beta Testing and Marketing does not come cheap!</p>
<p>We have the smallest budget possible out there. Some companies spend more than $250 - $500 thousand to develop and market a simple game.</p>
<p>What we are asking is for you to help us so we can contract beta testers and marketing companies. So we can finalize and commercialize not just one app but be able to use the same tools for many apps following right after Teenage Tracker.</p>

<p><strong>Beta Testing Company:</strong> This includes a special platform with bug and error reports, special functions for easier bug and error reporting and access to 60.000 Beta Testers.</p>
<p><strong>Marketing Campaign:</strong> Includes PR Releases, Video Marketing, Radio Marketing, App Review Marketing, etc. The full list will be provided to all the Pledgers, once the project is successful.</p>
<p><strong>Official Company Registration in Spain: </strong>PureApp Studio is the Name we have selected. To fully register a company in Spain needs a minimum of 3000 Euros as a basic capital of the company plus additional fees that apply when going through the whole registration procedure.</p>
<p><strong>Perk's Budget: </strong>Looking though the list of our Perks, you will see there are some that are actually tangible. T-Shirts, Caps, Key Chains, Car Bumper Stickers and actual hard copy User's Manual, etc., that will have to be printed and posted by mail to different countries.</p>
<p><strong>3rd Party Payment Processor &amp; IndieGoGo Fees: </strong>Those are the standard fees required when our Campaign becomes successful.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>Of course we hope this will not happen and we will reach our goal. However, if we do not to reach the goal, we will deliver all the Perks we have promised to our Pledgers. Because without you, we would not reach anything at all.</p>
<p>If there is a shortfall, we would create other campaigns to cover it by separating our targeted goals and will try to raise the funding separately. Here is a breakdown:</p>

<p><strong>Beta Testing Company: </strong>This is our main goal, as without it Teenage Tracker and The Platform cannot be.</p>
<p><strong>Marketing Campaign: </strong>Marketing is the second most important stage to deliver Teenage Tracker to the world.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>In anticipation of receiving funding over our initial target, a contingency outline for future development would be given greater detail and brought forward in time.</p>
<p>Only when the funding is in place will we be able to detail our plans. At that stage we will inform everyone in regard to developments.</p>

<p>Whether you Pledge or not, you still can help in many different ways. Please come and help us; there are so many things you can do. Even if you have pledged and want to help us even more, here are the things you can do to give us a helping hand:</p>
<ul>
<li>Spread the word about our IndieGoGo Project</li>
</ul><p>Please share our IndieGoGo's page with all the tools they have offer.</p>
<ul>
<li>Download Teenage Tracker BETA and play around with it</li>
</ul><p>If you download and test our beta version and the app crashes, we will receive a basic report on what happened with the app and why it crashed. This way we will be able to locate that problem and fix it.</p>
<ul>
<li>Visit our Facebook Pages</li>
<li>Visit our Twitter Pages</li>
<li>Visit our Websites</li>

<p>All the Perks are transferable. Which means the more you support, the more you will receive in return for the time and support that you are giving Teenage Tracker and us. This means if you donate a larger sum of money, you will get everything under that amount.</p>
<p>For example, if you donate $100 you receive not only everything that Perk offers, you also get every Perk right down to the $10 offer too.</p>

<p><strong>Mobile Baby Monitor App</strong></p>
<p>Baby Monitor, is a mobile replacement to the old, annoying and outdated standard baby monitors that work on short-range radio, pick up weird sounds and must be constantly working. The new baby monitors offer video feed but also cost quite a lot and interfere with other equipment around the house. Our Mobile Baby Monitor will take care of all the problems and negatives that ordinary baby monitors have.</p>

<p><strong>Mobile Car Alarm App</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong>Many of us have a car, which gets simple bumps and scratches. Unfortunately, sometimes people steal parts from our car from outside and sometimes break ins occur.</p>

By having an old phone in the car, you will be able to get a buzz on your personal phone every time the car is slightly bumped or moved. It will give you a buzz and you can activate the phones microphone and camera, record the live feed and if, heaven forbid, the car is stolen, you can track it on Google maps. </p>

<p><strong><img alt=""Frequently Asked Questions"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://pureappstudio.com/indiegogo/new/frequently_asked_questions.png"" src="""" style="""" title=""Frequently Asked Questions""/></strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>•   <strong>How does the app work?</strong></p>
<p>All you have to do is to install it on your phone and your child’s phone. After that, simply pair both devices with your personal phone id and pin set. Then you are ready to go. It is simple as that.</p>
<p>•   <strong>Is this app legal?</strong></p>
<p>As long as the parent has the legal custody of a child or has permission from the person who holds the phone, it is totally legal to use the app. In the UK, then you also need the child’s permission in writing even if you are the legal parent or guardian of the child.  If any of those conditions are not met, then is the person who is monitoring the remote, is who is breaking the law, not the app.</p>
<p>•   <strong>Who is responsible if the app will fail to work?</strong></p>
<p>We will immediately attempt to resolve the issue in a shortest time possible if the problem persists, please read our refund policy.</p>
<p>•  <strong> Can I use the app in a different way other than tracking teenagers?</strong></p>
<p>Provided that your actions are deemed both moral and legal under the jurisdiction of which you reside, then you can do whatever you please. Be advised that we take no responsibility for your actions.</p>
<p>•   <strong>Is it possible to hide the app, so my child will not know that it is there?</strong></p>
<p>No! This is neither moral nor ethical. We do not plan to implement this feature at any time. Please do not request it!<br/><br/>•   <strong>How much will the app cost?</strong></p>
<p>Once the app is commercially released, please visit Google Play Store of your country and it will tell you.</p>
<p>•   <strong>Is there any similar app to Teenage Tracker?</strong></p>
<p>At the time of writing this documentation, to our knowledge, there is nothing that offers the same level of flexibility and set of features that are offered by Teenage Tracker.</p>
<p>•   <strong>Will Teenage Tracker be available for iPhone?</strong></p>
<p>We are considering a release for an iPhoneowever, this is subject to a level of commercial success on the Android Platform.</p>
<p>•   <strong>Can the app be used if my child is in a different country?</strong></p>
<p>Wherever you and your child have an Internet access the system will work, regardless the distance between you and your child. Features are planned in future versions that allow some degree of connectivity where Internet access is limited.</p>
<p>•  <strong> Can this app be considered as intrusion into private life?</strong></p>
<p>This is subjected to your community’s moral values. However, in most countries it is not considered intrusive if the person that is being monitored is under your legal custody or you have explicit permission from that person.</p>
<p>•   <strong>Who is responsible for the misuse of Teenage Tracker app?</strong></p>
<p>As with any computer software product, under the Computers Misuse Act and similar laws in other countries, you are obliged to have permission to access any remote system. And therefore the previous conditions mentioned before: “The person who owns the phone that is going to be tracked is under your legal custody or you have explicit permission to track their phone” are applied.</p>
<p>•   <strong>What can I do if my child has turned off/uninstalled the app?</strong></p>
<p>This is a family matter for you to deal as seen appropriately.</p>
<p>•   <strong>Can I be legally penalized for tracking my child?</strong></p>
<p>In all known jurisdictions to us, if you have legal custody and/or explicit permission, the answer is no. However, you are encouraged to consult your local laws on that matter.</p>
<p>•   <strong>How many minutes of conversation can I record from my child’s phone?</strong></p>
<p> It depends on the memory capacity that your phone has.</p>
<p>•   <strong>How can I know what my child is doing if the phone is in his pocket?</strong></p>
<p>The video feed will not be useful in this case as the clothing will obstruct cameras. However, you can still use audio, GPS tracking and movement sensors.</p>
<p>•   <strong>Will you provide updates for Teenage Tracker?</strong></p>
<p>Of course we will! This is standard practice with all software products.</p>
<p>•   <strong>Do you collect data from our cell phones?</strong></p>
<p>Not in the slightest! The only information we have on record is the email address associated with your handset.</p>
<p>•   <strong>Do you offer tech support?</strong></p>
<p>Currently no, as Teenage Tracker is in Beta Stage, but once the app is commercially released, we will have a ticketing system set up to help you with any issue you may encounter with Teenage Tracker.</p>
<p>•  <strong> How does Teenage Tracker pinpoint’s my child’s location?<br/><br/></strong>Using the phones built in GPS location services.<br/><br/>•   <strong>Can my son/daughter discover that Teenage Tracker is on their phone?</strong></p>
<p>Yes! We do not hide the presence of the app on the phone. It is important to us to be considered an ethical company.<br/><br/>•   <strong>Can anybody else monitor my child phone?</strong></p>
<p>No. Not even we can do that, as we do not collect or store the login credentials.</p>

26.01.13
Teenage Tracker is currently in a full operational beta stage, so download it to your Android phone and try all the current features. Might be some problems and the app might crash occasionally. If you do experience a crash as a beta tester, please let us know so we can remedy the last outstanding bugs. We'd appreciate you downloading and start using it for free today.
 


 
Originally, Teenage Tracker was simply called “I Hear You”. We just wanted to access each other’s phones at any given moment. After first trials, using a cloud server system and Peer to Peer connectivity, we soon saw there was much more scope and scalability for complex operations. Thereby allowing creation of many different products from this base platform.
For the past 6 months, the platform on which Teenage Tracker is based has in fact been written, studied, and rewritten several times until it was deemed stable and scalable to at least a few hundred thousand active users. This may be a little obsessive for a start up, but it is the corner stone to our business model.
Our IndieGoGo campaign is not just about the Teenage Tracking App and making it a commercial product. It is mainly about our Platform and about being able to create useful P2P /social interactive applications.  As many as can be conceived. Imagine it as a conveyer belt of niche apps.
 


 

We asked random people for there opinion of the app. This is 100% genuine, if you have any question for any of those people we would be glad to put you in touch.
 


 
The goal is to fulfill the contract with a company of Professional Beta Testers. This will help us to find problems that may still be within Teenage Tracker and the whole Platform. This is a crucial step in developing any successful app or software.
Marketing capital: To make Teenage Tracker and the following applications a commercial success. Without proper marketing and advertising, no one will ever know the product is out there.
 


 
There are many ways to raise capital, the most common ones are: Friends & Family, Bank loan or Private investors. But every form of raising start up capital comes with its own set of drawbacks. Crowd funding is the newest and most outrageous of all concepts but it is beautiful at the same time. Indeed, contributions can be made with out asking for any perk at all but let’s face it not many can resist the temptation of a great deal.
 And great deals they are, since they work both ways. Without the initial contributions, it would be a lot harder, if not impossible, to launch the product. Once the product is launched giving it out to our contributors comes at a negligible cost, and therefore everybody is happy. Meanwhile, let us examine our other options:-
 Family and friends are a great source but for 99% or more of the global population (including us) our ideas, dreams and passions are even bigger than the combined resources of our extended families. Not to mention they probably have their own big ideas.
 Banks are great but by far the most expensive route to take; placing unnecessary overhead upon the already limited cash flow. They are much less flexible and get heavy handed much quicker if things take that little bit longer than anticipated. Which is, in fact, just a part of life. If everything could always go to plan, financial risk would never be an issue.
 Private investors are our second best option. Great venture capitalists take many factors into account. The presentation, the numbers and trust must all be in place in all the correct quantities to make a deal. This can be an extremely long drawn out process just finding such a wonderful person that just fits in with the vision, the team and most importantly is prepared to provide the funding.

Why Crowd Funding? Because it is by far, THE MOST COST EFFECTIVE FORM OF INVESTMENT for all concerned. Repayment is made in the form of our created intellectual property, which costs nothing extra to install on your phone, plus whatever level of perk was subscribed to if any was requested. Therefore, by paying everyone back in a non-monetary form, it means more of the financial capital is invested in our growth and none is allocated to high interest rates and balance repayments. There are some perks that will cost us a great deal but we have only promised those once we know we have a solid foundation to stand on.
 


 
Without your support, it will be really hard to get to the stage where PureApp Studio's Platform and Teenage Tracker can be bug & error free. We will not be able to deliver to all the people already believing in Teenage Tracker; actually waiting for the app to be there and start fully using all of its features.

We really ask for your consideration and help. As you can see we have the Teenage Tracker and the whole Platform there ready and set up in a Beta Stage. We have spent 6 months and over $15.000 in development. Have used all of our savings we had from previously working our day jobs. We now need your support as Beta Testing and Marketing does not come cheap!
We have the smallest budget possible out there. Some companies spend more than $250 - $500 thousand to develop and market a simple game.
What we are asking is for you to help us so we can contract beta testers and marketing companies. So we can finalize and commercialize not just one app but be able to use the same tools for many apps following right after Teenage Tracker.
 



* All dates are subjected to change, depending on the result of the Campaign
 


 

Beta Testing Company: This includes a special platform with bug and error reports, special functions for easier bug and error reporting and access to 60.000 Beta Testers.
Marketing Campaign: Includes PR Releases, Video Marketing, Radio Marketing, App Review Marketing, etc. The full list will be provided to all the Pledgers, once the project is successful.
Official Company Registration in Spain: PureApp Studio is the Name we have selected. To fully register a company in Spain needs a minimum of 3000 Euros as a basic capital of the company plus additional fees that apply when going through the whole registration procedure.
Perk's Budget: Looking though the list of our Perks, you will see there are some that are actually tangible. T-Shirts, Caps, Key Chains, Car Bumper Stickers and actual hard copy User's Manual, etc., that will have to be printed and posted by mail to different countries.
3rd Party Payment Processor & IndieGoGo Fees: Those are the standard fees required when our Campaign becomes successful.
 


 
Of course we hope this will not happen and we will reach our goal. However, if we do not to reach the goal, we will deliver all the Perks we have promised to our Pledgers. Because without you, we would not reach anything at all.
If there is a shortfall, we would create other campaigns to cover it by separating our targeted goals and will try to raise the funding separately. Here is a breakdown:

Beta Testing Company: This is our main goal, as without it Teenage Tracker and The Platform cannot be.
Marketing Campaign: Marketing is the second most important stage to deliver Teenage Tracker to the world.
 


 
In anticipation of receiving funding over our initial target, a contingency outline for future development would be given greater detail and brought forward in time.
Only when the funding is in place will we be able to detail our plans. At that stage we will inform everyone in regard to developments.
 


 
Whether you Pledge or not, you still can help in many different ways. Please come and help us; there are so many things you can do. Even if you have pledged and want to help us even more, here are the things you can do to give us a helping hand:

Spread the word about our IndieGoGo Project
Please share our IndieGoGo's page with all the tools they have offer.

Download Teenage Tracker BETA and play around with it
If you download and test our beta version and the app crashes, we will receive a basic report on what happened with the app and why it crashed. This way we will be able to locate that problem and fix it.

Visit our Facebook Pages
Visit our Twitter Pages
Visit our Websites
Share them with friends. Make comments or suggestions on them. Be part of the community. This will help us to grow faster and stronger.
 



All the Perks are transferable. Which means the more you support, the more you will receive in return for the time and support that you are giving Teenage Tracker and us. This means if you donate a larger sum of money, you will get everything under that amount.
For example, if you donate $100 you receive not only everything that Perk offers, you also get every Perk right down to the $10 offer too.

•   Can this app be considered as intrusion into private life?
This is subjected to your community’s moral values. However, in most countries it is not considered intrusive if the person that is being monitored is under your legal custody or you have explicit permission from that person.
•   Who is responsible for the misuse of Teenage Tracker app?
As with any computer software product, under the Computers Misuse Act and similar laws in other countries, you are obliged to have permission to access any remote system. And therefore the previous conditions mentioned before: “The person who owns the phone that is going to be tracked is under your legal custody or you have explicit permission to track their phone” are applied.
•   What can I do if my child has turned off/uninstalled the app?
This is a family matter for you to deal as seen appropriately.
•   Can I be legally penalized for tracking my child?
In all known jurisdictions to us, if you have legal custody and/or explicit permission, the answer is no. However, you are encouraged to consult your local laws on that matter.
•   How many minutes of conversation can I record from my child’s phone?
 It depends on the memory capacity that your phone has.
•   How can I know what my child is doing if the phone is in his pocket?
The video feed will not be useful in this case as the clothing will obstruct cameras. However, you can still use audio, GPS tracking and movement sensors.
•   Will you provide updates for Teenage Tracker?
Of course we will! This is standard practice with all software products.
•   Do you collect data from our cell phones?
Not in the slightest! The only information we have on record is the email address associated with your handset.
•   Do you offer tech support?
Currently no, as Teenage Tracker is in Beta Stage, but once the app is commercially released, we will have a ticketing system set up to help you with any issue you may encounter with Teenage Tracker.
•   How does Teenage Tracker pinpoint’s my child’s location?Using the phones built in GPS location services.•   Can my son/daughter discover that Teenage Tracker is on their phone?
Yes! We do not hide the presence of the app on the phone. It is important to us to be considered an ethical company.•   Can anybody else monitor my child phone?
No. Not even we can do that, as we do not collect or store the login credentials.

</div><p><b>English Version</b></p><p><b><br/></b></p><p><b>Summary</b></p><p>This year we celebrate the 545th anniversary of the
Lipnic Battle, where Ștefan cel Mare, the illustrious ruler of Moldova,
defeated the Tatar invaders. This is the only battle of Ștefan cel Mare that
took place on the territory
which is today part of the Republic of Moldova.</p>
<p>According to the tradition, the battle began from
Fântâna Cadânei (""<i>The Well of the
Odalisque</i>""). The legend says that the name of the well comes from a
beautiful girl who, being chased by a Turk seeking to take her to his harem,
jumped into a well located near Lipnic. </p>
<p>The well dates back before the Lipnic Battle (thus, it
is at least from the XV century). It was rebuilt several times, while in 1970
it received the status of protected monument. The most recent renovation of the
well took place in 1989.</p>
<p>Since Fântâna Cadânei is currently in a deplorable
condition, we decided to restore it.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/726469/files/20140718044702-10348887_730876390288710_2433091600685354499_o.jpg?1405684022"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>The draft project for the rehabilitation of Fântâna Cadânei and of the neighbouring area was
initially submitted for the discussions with the Nationa Council of Historic
Monuments at the end of May 2014. At that moment, the Council reverted
with certain recommendations in order to observe the authenticity requirements
of the site. We took these recommendations into consideration, so that in July
2014, the project in an adjusted form was re-submitted with the Council receiving
the approval (the approval document of 14 July 2014 is available on this page). <br/></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/728324/files/20140719003130-10447414_10203330434754594_4944916603351205009_n.jpg?1405755090"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p><b>The Impact</b></p>

<p>·<span> 
</span>arrange a historical landscape by

<p>·<span> 
</span>promote the well as part of the touristic

wooden churches, boyar mansions, house museums and natural landscapes..</p>
<p>·<span>

<p><b>Rezumat</b></p>
<p>În acest an, aniversăm 545 de ani de la
bătălia de la Lipnic, unde Ștefan cel Mare, ilustrul domnitor al Moldovei, i-a
înfrânt pe invadatorii tătari. Este singura bătălie a lui Ștefan cel Mare care
a avut loc pe teritoriul actual al Republicii Moldova.</p>
<p>Potrivit tradiției, lupta a început de la
Fântâna Cadânei. Legenda spune că numele fântânei vine de la o fată frumoasă
care, fiind urmărită de un turc ce încerca s-o ducă în haremul său, a sărit
într-o fântână de lângă Lipnic.</p>
<p>Fântâna datează încă dinaintea bătăliei de
la Lipnic (fiind, astfel, cel puțin din secolul XV). A fost reconstruită de
câteva ori, iar în 1970 capătă statutul de monument protejat. Ultima renovare a

Lipnic Battle, where Ștefan cel Mare, the illustrious ruler of Moldova,
defeated the Tatar invaders. This is the only battle of Ștefan cel Mare that
took place on the territory
which is today part of the Republic of Moldova.
According to the tradition, the battle began from
Fântâna Cadânei (""The Well of the
Odalisque""). The legend says that the name of the well comes from a
beautiful girl who, being chased by a Turk seeking to take her to his harem,
jumped into a well located near Lipnic. 
The well dates back before the Lipnic Battle (thus, it
is at least from the XV century). It was rebuilt several times, while in 1970
it received the status of protected monument. The most recent renovation of the
well took place in 1989.
Since Fântâna Cadânei is currently in a deplorable
condition, we decided to restore it.
The draft project for the rehabilitation of Fântâna Cadânei and of the neighbouring area was
initially submitted for the discussions with the Nationa Council of Historic
Monuments at the end of May 2014. At that moment, the Council reverted
with certain recommendations in order to observe the authenticity requirements
of the site. We took these recommendations into consideration, so that in July
2014, the project in an adjusted form was re-submitted with the Council receiving
the approval (the approval document of 14 July 2014 is available on this page). The Impact
The project aims to:
· 
create a unique historical place that
brings closer to the people the spirit of the place and the values of the
country. 
· 
arrange a historical landscape by
restoring the existing well according to the authenticity requirements.. 
· 
promote the well as part of the touristic
route of the area, which also includes, amongst others, windmills, watermills,
wooden churches, boyar mansions, house museums and natural landscapes..
· 
give an example of rehabilitation of
monuments, as the monuments in the Republic of Moldova are in a continuous
degradation.
· 
offer the possibility for the community
to get involved.
· 
sensitize the public with respect to the
problem of degradation of protected monuments.  What We Need

The total value of the project is estimated not
to exceed EUR 5000. A part of this amount (USD 4000) is collected through this
platform. You may also contribute by transferring the amounts to the bank accounts mentioned at the bottom of this text.
In any case, the project is the type of
initiative that, beyond financial contribution, requires active implication of
different people in the effective implementation thereof.. 


Both the financial contribution that the
project needs and active involvement of different people are strong success
factors that will ensure the continuity of this project and hopefully will have
effects upon our society.

Rezumat
În acest an, aniversăm 545 de ani de la
bătălia de la Lipnic, unde Ștefan cel Mare, ilustrul domnitor al Moldovei, i-a
înfrânt pe invadatorii tătari. Este singura bătălie a lui Ștefan cel Mare care
a avut loc pe teritoriul actual al Republicii Moldova.
Potrivit tradiției, lupta a început de la
Fântâna Cadânei. Legenda spune că numele fântânei vine de la o fată frumoasă
care, fiind urmărită de un turc ce încerca s-o ducă în haremul său, a sărit
într-o fântână de lângă Lipnic.
Fântâna datează încă dinaintea bătăliei de
la Lipnic (fiind, astfel, cel puțin din secolul XV). A fost reconstruită de
câteva ori, iar în 1970 capătă statutul de monument protejat. Ultima renovare a
fântânii s-a realizat în 1989.
Având în vedere că Fântâna Cadânei este în
prezent într-o stare deplorabilă, am decis s-o restaurăm.


Schița de proiect pentru reabilitarea Fântânii Cadânei și a
zonei adiacente a fost inițial supusă dezbaterii Consiliul Național al
Monumentelor Istorice la sfârșitul lunii mai 2014. La acel moment, Consiliul a
venit cu anumite recomandări pentru a se respecta cerințele de autenticitate
ale amplasamentului. Am ținut cont de aceste recomandări, astfel că în iulie
2014, proiectul în forma ajustată a fost redepus la Consiliu, primind avizul
pozitiv (fișa de avizare din 14 iulie 2014 este disponibilă pe această pagină).
Impactul
Proiectul urmărește:
· 
să
creeze o destinație istorică unică în măsură să aducă mai aproape spiritul
locului și valorile naționale.
· 
să
restaureze fântâna existentă potrivit cerințelor de autenticitate.
· 
să
promoveze fântâna ca parte a circuitului turistic în zonă, care de asemenea
include, printre altele, mori de vânt, mori de apă, biserici din lemn, conace
boierești, case-muzeu și peisaje naturale.
· 
să
dea un exemplu de reabilitare a monumentelor, având în vedere că monumentele în
Republica Moldova sunt într-o stare de permanentă degradare.
· 
să
ofere posibilitatea comunității de a se implica.
· 
să
sensibilizeze publicul cu privire la problema degradării monumentelor
protejate.
De ce avem nevoie

<p>The WeightZone project started after one of our founders had
a massive heart attack.  Jay was in his
forties, but he weighed over 300 pounds and owned an ice cream store – a bad
combination.  He continued to struggle
with his weight even after surviving open heart surgery, because all the advice
he found was trying to selling him something: a diet book, a program, or some
worthless over-the-counter pill.  </p>
<p>During his recovery, he did his own research; Jay’s an experienced
mathematician and software designer. 
Eventually, he wrote the first significant algorithm to estimate a
person’s weight since the Body Mass Index was created in 1832.  Far more accurate than the BMI, WeightZone
analyzes 25 facts before creating your personal Zone - a Zone as unique as your
DNA.  The simple message: don’t weigh
more than this; don’t weigh less than that.

to develop a comprehensive weight loss package that people could use at no
charge.  That’s why we decided to
self-fund everything.  We even shot our own video and created our own
pictures; we could have paid professionals, but who would we impress?  </p>

WeightZone algorithm, also writes the Company Blog. </i></b></p>
<p>Like many people, I’ve worried about my weight for my entire life.  I started earlier than most; the first time I
went to a doctor to lose weight I was four years old.  After examining me, the doctor gravely told
my mother and grandmother that I should lose eight pounds.  Obviously, I didn’t understand what he meant.
 I was four!  I couldn’t read the scale yet!  But somehow, he convinced them that if I lost
eight pounds I would be perfect.  Not
seven or nine pounds.  Eight.  Why? 
Because that’s what some chart on the wall said I should weigh.  </p>
<p>On the spot, my grandmother promised me that <span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.45em;"">if I lost eight pounds
she’d buy me a blue striped </span><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.45em;"">suit with a vest. 
I was barely out of diapers and </span><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.45em;"">she thought I would enjoy dressing up

motivator.</span></p>
<p>Well, I didn’t lose the eight pounds. 
I lost four.  It was the first of
many failures.  </p>
<p>I hit the yo-yo syndrome when I was a teenager.  I gained about fifty pounds in junior high,
and then my parents took me to our new family doctor.  He told me to lose 63 pounds, and then handed
me a box of amphetamines to take three times a day.  They worked, but I didn’t sleep for the month
of January, 1971.  I lost about forty
pounds, gained about sixty, and then went to a quack diet doctor our next door
neighbor recommended.  Dr. Quacker told
me to lose 83 pounds, warned that exercise would slow down my weight loss, and gave
me amphetamines to take six times a day. 
But he looked impressive in his expensive blue striped suit – maybe he
knew my grandmother.  </p><p><br/></p><p><b style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.45em;"">The Body Mass Index Gives Bad Advice  </b></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/185455/files/20131108213936-13.__NO_BMI.png?1383975576"" src="""" style=""cursor: nw-resize;""/></p><br/><p></p><p><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.45em;"">Somehow, something good came out of all this failure.  I learned that goal weights are useless unless
the target is achievable and maintainable, and I also learned that no one could
give me an achievable, maintainable goal. 
The Body Mass Index? 
Worthless.  The wall charts? Not
much better.  And then I realized
something surprising.</span><br/></p>
<p>I’m only 5’ 10”, but I’m a big man. 
Broad shoulders, big rib cage. 
Regardless, doctors kept telling me that according to the BMI I should
weigh 157.  They treated the Body Mass
Index as if it had magical powers – so magical that I had to balloon up past 320 and have a massive
heart attack to break free of its spell.  There’s one
good thing about having a heart attack: it you live, you learn to take care of yourself.  You learn to separate the good advice from the bad.  I learned, and then I started to look in the mirror.  </p><p><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.45em;"">                      </span><br/></p><p></p><p>                          <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/185452/files/20131108213224-12.__Jay_in_Hawaii.png?1383975144"" src="""" style=""width: 343.48754448398574px; height: 570px;""/></p><p></p><p><br/></p><p><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.45em;"">Somehow, as I recuperated, I developed an eating plan that I could stick with

<p>But during that long recuperation, I had a problem.  I couldn’t find a target weight I could trust.  I looked online.  It turns out that if you are 5’ 10” tall, the
BMI will always tell you to weigh 157 pounds. 
Man or woman, young or old, broad football player or narrow couch
potato, it doesn’t matter: height is the only factor the BMI uses.  The most popular metric in medicine is also
the worst.  </p>

<p></p></div>","It's a grim picture.  America has become the second fattest country in the world.  We are Virtual Wellness, and we can change the picture.We are a classic Silicon Valley story: a small
company with a big software application.  An
important, free application:
WeightZone.  
WeightZone can help you and the people you love to reach an
ideal weight.  And if enough people use WeightZone,
we can help combat the national obesity crisis. 
That’s why we think it is important. 

The WeightZone project started after one of our founders had
a massive heart attack.  Jay was in his
forties, but he weighed over 300 pounds and owned an ice cream store – a bad
combination.  He continued to struggle
with his weight even after surviving open heart surgery, because all the advice
he found was trying to selling him something: a diet book, a program, or some
worthless over-the-counter pill.  
During his recovery, he did his own research; Jay’s an experienced
mathematician and software designer. 
Eventually, he wrote the first significant algorithm to estimate a
person’s weight since the Body Mass Index was created in 1832.  Far more accurate than the BMI, WeightZone
analyzes 25 facts before creating your personal Zone - a Zone as unique as your
DNA.  The simple message: don’t weigh
more than this; don’t weigh less than that. 
As he was writing the algorithm, he formed our team, and we agreed
to develop a comprehensive weight loss package that people could use at no
charge.  That’s why we decided to
self-fund everything.  We even shot our own video and created our own
pictures; we could have paid professionals, but who would we impress?  
WeightZone is an amazing app that will help many people.  Some of them will help build our Company.  We hope you will be one of those builders,
and join us as we work to Reduce Obesity. 
The following pictures are taken from our website.  The data and the two-page analysis are real. Our entire team has been working on WeightZone for
more than two years.  Two of us are
wellness experts (Becky Williamson and Jay Wiener); two of us are software
engineers (John Alburger and Rolland Hoyt), and two of us have had multiple
successful startups (Majid Azad and John.) 
Obesity has affected us and it has affected our families: some of us

<h2>Hello, my name is Christen Lothridge. My 19 year old daughter Alexandra is seriously ill due to Chronic Lyme Disease and possibly other tick-borne diseases. Some of you well know that Lyme disease is a complex illness that is difficult to understand and treat. If not treated correctly and effectively Lyme disease will likely have an impact on a person for their entire life. </h2>
<p> </p>
<div><strong><em>Alexandra was bitten by a tick at the beginning of November of 2012. She began to develop flu like symptoms a few weeks later, with her symptoms increasing in severity almost on a daily basis after that. Alexandra was diagnosed with Lyme disease in December and was treated with a 21-day course of antibiotics. However, due to her symptoms, we believe that Alexandra has actually had Lyme for quite some time before her diagnosis in December. That is most likely why the Lyme is affecting Alexandra's central nervous system so quickly. It also means that the basic treatment she received would not be enough for her. After Alexandra completed the antibiotics, she began to feel somewhat better for a couple of weeks. Unfortunately, her Lyme symptoms came back with full vengeance and even worse in severity.</em></strong></div>

</div></span></div>","Hello, my name is Christen Lothridge. My 19 year old daughter Alexandra is seriously ill due to Chronic Lyme Disease and possibly other tick-borne diseases. Some of you well know that Lyme disease is a complex illness that is difficult to understand and treat. If not treated correctly and effectively Lyme disease will likely have an impact on a person for their entire life. 
 
Alexandra was bitten by a tick at the beginning of November of 2012. She began to develop flu like symptoms a few weeks later, with her symptoms increasing in severity almost on a daily basis after that. Alexandra was diagnosed with Lyme disease in December and was treated with a 21-day course of antibiotics. However, due to her symptoms, we believe that Alexandra has actually had Lyme for quite some time before her diagnosis in December. That is most likely why the Lyme is affecting Alexandra's central nervous system so quickly. It also means that the basic treatment she received would not be enough for her. After Alexandra completed the antibiotics, she began to feel somewhat better for a couple of weeks. Unfortunately, her Lyme symptoms came back with full vengeance and even worse in severity.
 
Unfortunately, the cost of Alexandra's medical care is more than I can cover due to other financial hardships that I've experienced in the last few years. I have no other resources than to reach out and ask for help from others. The flu like symptoms of general malaise, mild body aches, headache, stomach pain and nausea are nothing in comparison to how the Lyme disease is already currently affecting Alexandra's central nervous system.

She is unable to work, drive a car, and has had to take the semester off from college. At the age of 19 all activities of daily living are a struggle for Alexandra. I just can't stand to see my daughter suffer. I have seen Alexandra go from a young fairly healthly woman who always had a smile on her face and was due to graduate from college this May at the the age of 19 into a young woman who now struggles get out of bed everyday.

<p>A study from a leading university tracked two groups of people: one that was resistance training with a WeightVest and another that was doing only traditional resistance training. In six weeks, both groups were tested to determine progress. <br/><br/>The group that used weight vests in addition to their resistance training performed better. That group's results in the vertical jump, broad jump and 40-yard dash were meaningfully better than the group not using WeightVests.<br/></p>

<p>The weight loss factor of WeightVests occurs through the burning of calories. This is especially seen when cardio workouts are performed with the WeightVest on. <br/><br/>If the desired effect of running with a WeightVest is to enhance the amount of calories you burn, then that increase will occur.<br/></p>

<p>A WeightVest does increase the rate at which you lose weight, because it enhances the calorie-burning effects of cardio exercises like running. Though the primary use of a WeightVest is for resistance training, aerobic exercises with a WeightVest are also possible. Aerobic exercises with a WeightVest on increases the number of calories that you burn during such a workout. </p>

We started designing and developing a fitnesstool that would give each and everyone the possiblity to find more challenge, push their boundaries, and boost their workout.
And so we proudly present the CrossXvest WeightVest, exclusively available on Indiegogo!
Thanks for checking out our project!
_________________________________________________________________________________ The CrossXvest WeightVest is a fully adjustable fitnesstool from 0 kg/ 0 lb. to a max of 20 kg./44 lb. The Vest is a one size fits all model, and has special features to make it fit perfect for each body. Because of these special features the vest is suitable for men and woman at every level.


 
_________________________________________________________________________________
Our product is produced in collaboration with a producer for military and policeforces gear. This means that we have the best quality materials available for the CrossXvest WeightVest. The overwhelming durability of 1000 denier Cordura qualifies this fabric for heavy duty use. Characteristic features of this nylon fabric such as resistance to tears and scuffs indicate it performs fantastic for outdoors. We analyzed the WeightVest on all kind of conditions. This to develop the best possible WeightVest for you. The CrossXvest WeightVest is worldwide tested by many professionals.

                                        
                                            ___________________________________________________________________________This fitnesstool increases strength, stamina, explosivity, power, flexibility and endurance! Your body works harder and more muscles are involved, you will burn more KCAL and reduce more fat overall. It's a quick boost of big muscle groups like your back, legs, chest and core. It will boost your condition and energy levels in all kinds of workouts and different in- and outdoor sports.
A study from a leading university tracked two groups of people: one that was resistance training with a WeightVest and another that was doing only traditional resistance training. In six weeks, both groups were tested to determine progress. The group that used weight vests in addition to their resistance training performed better. That group's results in the vertical jump, broad jump and 40-yard dash were meaningfully better than the group not using WeightVests.


The weight loss factor of WeightVests occurs through the burning of calories. This is especially seen when cardio workouts are performed with the WeightVest on. If the desired effect of running with a WeightVest is to enhance the amount of calories you burn, then that increase will occur.


A WeightVest does increase the rate at which you lose weight, because it enhances the calorie-burning effects of cardio exercises like running. Though the primary use of a WeightVest is for resistance training, aerobic exercises with a WeightVest are also possible. Aerobic exercises with a WeightVest on increases the number of calories that you burn during such a workout. 

_________________________________________________________________________________The WeightVest is adjustable from 0 kg./0 lb. to a maximum weight of 20 kg./44.1lb. You can easily adjust the vest, each weight is 1 kg./2.2 lb. This makes the vest easy to use and available for everyone.
We advice all WeightVest users to start with our level system
 
Beginner     4 - 6 kg./4.4 - 13.2 lb.Regular       6 - 10 kg./13.2 - 22 lb.Advanced   10 - 20 kg./22 - 44.1 lb.          
 If
 you train daily you can get fit and strong fast, you will notice that 
you can upgrade your WeightVest by adding 1 kg. /2.2 lb. till maximum 2 
kg./4.4 lb. a time.

In March 2012 I was diagnosed with breast cancer and had a mastectomy. My recovery time was all together 3 months when I couldn't work. I still had to pay my health insurance and my husband's salary was not enough to cover all the expenses so all our savings were gone. At the beginning of 2013 my doctors recommended to go through hysterectomy as a result of massive tumors that could have been malignant.

I am a waitress and my husband works for a construction company as a framer. In March 2012 I was diagnosed with breast cancer and had a mastectomy.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Martial Arts has changed my life. It has made me happier, healthier, and has taught me the importance of not giving up when things become difficult. It has helped me build friendships that will last a lifetime and given me training partners that I have high respect for. Building this Academy will not make me financially successful. I just want to earn enough to keep the lights on for our students. If we can build a place where people love to attend and where we can really make a difference in peoples lives, that would mean more to me than any financial gain. That would be worth all the time and sacrifices I am making to get this off the ground. </p>

<p>I am no ones master. I am simply a student that is willing to train and teach all that I have learned. I love teaching the kids especially. Watching them become more confident, and learn to overcome difficult situations is gratifying. I try to be a good example to them on and off the mats. Showing them I am willing to fight to keep our team together is important to me. I will be working to get us a new head Jiu Jitsu coach after we open. </p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Martial Arts can be life changing. It crushes ego, builds confidence and teaches you more than just cool moves. It helps you get in shape and builds lifelong friendships.

<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>We know there will be many challenges along the way and unexpected costs as we move along. Even after we raise the funds there will be a lot of building to do and paperwork to get us up and running.  We will lean on our friends and family to get this built quickly.</p>
<p>In the end we will have an affordable and friendly place where we can train and grow together. Every donation will be used to build our facility. We really need your help and would appreciate you telling others about our goal.  <u><strong>If we do not reach our goal, unfortunately we will not be able to open.</strong> <strong>Please help as much as you can.</strong></u>Thank you!</p>

specialized in herbal remedies by profession, a Reflexologist by passion!
I learnt about Reflexology from a Medical
Doctor in Uruguay and  became my family therapist. While living in South Asia, I improved my
learning and practice. When I came back to live in Italy, I
started doing it on charity basis, as a service towards the needy.As the Italian Health Insurance does not
cover Reflexology treatments, the poor people have not access to them. But
there is a way to remedy this problem: teaching them how to improve themselves
their health through Reflexology. 
I am asking for your help in order to
getting 2.100 euros, the minimum financial resources to cover the teachings of
three courses for the poor elderly living in Genoa, Liguria. 
For every donation of 10 euros, you'll
get one reflexology map sent to you by email.
For every donation of 25 euros, you'll
get three reflexology maps sent to you by email.
For every donation of 50 euros, you'll
get five reflexology maps sent to you by email.
If the amount does not reach the total
need, I will teach as many courses as possible, one or two...
Wherever your donations might exceed the
need, they will be dedicated to special treatments for the ailments that cannot
be solved only through self-treatment.

<div><p><b>A.K.A How My Life Changed At 40 To Lead Me To Represent My Country As An
Elite Athlete</b></p></div>
<p>Us Aussies loves our sport.</p>
<p>We spend years as kids learning how to be our sporting idols, weekends
cheering for teams and hours watching people compete to take out championships
at local, state, national and international level. With the Commonwealth
Games happening right now in Glasgow, I’m sure many of you are cheering on your
favourites, willing them to bring home the Gold. </p>
<p>While you’re watching these exceptional athletes, just take a closer look at them. In the main, they
appear to be in their teens, and twenties. The majority of them may have
been training at their chosen sport, almost since they could walk. For many of
us who habour dreams of becoming a champion at our favourite sport, these
dreams gradually fade as we grow up, go to university, get a job, get married,
have kids…grow older...and forty five is far too old to become a World champion...</p>
<p>Isn't it? </p>
<p>Well, five years ago, I would definitely have agreed with you.</p>
<p>You see, like any other person, I was in a stable long term relationship,  working as a computer programmer, going out
with friends to café’s or restaurants or the pub after work most Fridays. I
played a bit of social tennis, went to the gym a few times a week (to earn my
Friday night beer!); </p>
<p>You know…normal.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/748494/files/20140728031710-normal.jpg?1406542630"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><span>It was when my relationship went sour and I found myself
suddenly single, a bit lost and direction less that I knew something had to
change. I wasn't happy with many things in my life and like many other women my
weight was a massive issue for me...so a fitness assessment at my gym that put
me into the 'obese' category was a mighty shock! </span></p>
<p>I cried. A lot. Life wasn't supposed to be like this! </p>
<p>But crying wasn't going to fix it, so I decided to do something about
it and that is when the gym started to feature much more regularly in my life and
I loved it.</p>
<p></p>

<p><span>25 kg later (lighter!), I was looking great, but my life was a mess and
clinical depression set in. Exercise is frequently touted as being
beneficial for depression and so it proved - the gym became my sanctuary, as I
focused intently on the only thing that seemed to be working. I hired a <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/BakerPersonalTrainingAndFitness?ref=ts&amp;fref=ts"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">trainer </a>and the results we started getting were a revelation to me. I decided to reward myself with a photo-shoot - for coming
so far and not quitting, and this led to the snap decision to compete in a bodybuilding
contest - and I won! </span></p>
<p><span></span></p>

<p></p>
<p>State Novice Figure Champion at my first attempt! </p>
<p>That was followed up
with 3<sup>rd</sup> at National and 3<sup>rd</sup> at the Natural Universe
competition…at just my 3<sup>rd</sup> show!</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><span>Now I had the bug and wanted to see how far this unexpected turn of
events would go, but long term shoulder problems led to the doctors
telling me to quit (all) sport - or get a double shoulder reconstruction. I
took the surgery option and went back to the gym, only to be told again by the
doctors to 'not even walk if I could avoid it' or face double hip surgery as injuries piled on top of
injuries. </span></p>

<p>Sometimes it only takes one person to believe in you, and that was it - after I'd picked my jaw off the floor, we set to work. 9 more long slow months, not of bodybuilding, but re-building my body
structurally from the ground up. Another year of slow patient building, leading up to last year’s successful comeback winning 5 of 6 State categories, 1 overall State title and my category at

<br/><p><span>Who'd have thought, a mild mannered, formerly very overweight 40 year
old computer programmer would now be in a position to not only represent
Australia on the world stage, but is a very strong contender to win gold!</span></p>

over the world, who too are representing their country, waiting...waiting -
anxiously, heart in mouth to hear the announcement...I hear it...</p>
<p><b>'and the winner is...representing Australia...Sarah
Taylor!'</b></p>
<p>I would cry, I know that – tears of joy, relief and sheer pride in the
fact that I'd done everyone who supported me proud, knowing that Aiden’s
belief in me and complete commitment to the process was justified and no matter how tough it got, I never gave up on
my dream.</p>
<p>I know that I
am a serious contender to take out the Worlds, I just
need your support to help me get there, to show the world
that us Aussies pull together, to show them we are ‘the best of the
best’ on the biggest stage.</p>

A.K.A How My Life Changed At 40 To Lead Me To Represent My Country As An
Elite Athlete
Us Aussies loves our sport.
We spend years as kids learning how to be our sporting idols, weekends

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Meditation Touch team
puts high emphasis on listening to and understanding your needs and desires.
We'd love to know how you think Meditation Touch will improve your life and in
what situations you would see yourself using the app. For this purpose, we have

<p><b>5. Do I have to be an
experienced meditator to enjoy the Meditation Touch app?</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">No! Meditation Touch
is built to suit everybody, even those who have never practised meditation, as
well as those who have been practising for a long time. The Physiological measurements and
iFeel Emotional Diagnosis® will allow Meditation Touch to adjust, every

the variety of meditations and to allow you to get familiar with an exciting

<p><b>6. What is
Biofeedback?</b></p>
<a name=""biofeedback"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Biofeedback helps in
understanding and controlling the connection between body and mind by providing
real-time physiological measurement (e.g., <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electroencephalography"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">brainwaves</a>, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle_tone"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">muscle tone</a>, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin_conductance"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">skin conductance</a>, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_rate"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_rate_variability"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">and heart rate variability</a><b></b>) in
conjunction with the emotional state. Those physiological indicators are
associated with many emotional situations such as stress, anxiety, anger, etc.
Developing awareness to those indicators and learning relaxation techniques
(such as breathing and guided imagery) can improve your control of those
situations and help you learn how to manage those emotions, rather than letting
the emotions manage you. Using Meditation Touch will help you monitor these
indicators and enable you to easily perceive the positive effects of meditation
on the body in real time.</p>
<p><b>7. Do I have to
purchase additional biofeedback devices to use Meditation Touch?</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>No! </b>To enjoy the emotional diagnosis and to
receive the right meditation for you, you don't need any additional biofeedback
devices. However, to maximize the Meditation Touch experience, the Meditation
Touch team believes, you need to listen well to your body (and not just to your
mind), and this can be done easily and precisely using the biofeedback
technologies. Over the next year, the new generation of smartphones and smartwatches (like
Samsung S5, Apple Watch) will already give some basic biofeedback technologies as an
integral part which can be used directly with Meditation Touch. Moreover, the Meditation
Touch team understands the need and desire of the users to get deep
physiological feedback with advanced equipment (e.g., heart rate variation, skin conductance,
brain waves), so we are working hard to support them. Even at present, you can
ensure yourself the most beneficial Meditation Touch experience by choosing the
biofeedback stress monitor offered as perks for contributors.</p>

<p>Please allow me to introduce “Forward March”, a
comprehensive, whole wellness treatment program available to all, with an
emphasis on assisting our underserved  <b>veterans.</b> Our commitment is to help
those that are at risk of homelessness, suicide, isolation, and the dissolving of
the family.  Our research goes back 45 years to the Vietnam era and its returning, neglected veterans. Our program is an innovative, lifesaving, 1:1, steps curriculum that will
change the world. We are in fact, the next big idea in well-being.  We aim to eradicate homelessness and put a
severe dent in the number of broken families and most important,, the overwhelming number of suicides our
country grieves from.  Phillips and
“Forward March” share the same goal: TO SAVE LIVES.  Our mission is to expand our current 10 bed facility by renovating an additional existed wing, and eventually setting up satellite veteran wellness centers throughout the country, (especially in high veteran population areas such as California, Texas and Florida).</p>
<p>· Our “self-directed with 1:1 support &amp; services” type program is accountability based.  Forward March is set up as a 7 step, three area, highly focused individual action plan that lasts as long as the individual needs it to.  We are not a 20 day, 60 day, etc program.  If a person needs a year to complete their program, they may have a year.<br/></p>
<p></p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>Our commitment  will have such a positive
impact on our country it will reach the levels of effectiveness to match those such as “Boys
and Girls Clubs of America”, “AA”, “Red Cross”, “Saint Jude’s Children’s Research
Hospitals”, and/or “Ronald McDonald House’s”. In short, we will be making a lasting
difference.  This is not a feel good
camping event where the individual has fun for a week then goes back to real
life. </p>
<p>· We provide the opportunity for needed self-evaluation, tools and steps to reach a level of wellness that combats the effects of depression, PTSD, anxiety, isolation, homelessness, etc.  We are the program that makes it possible for a person to move forward and reach a level of healing and whole wellness so that they may live as a happy, passionate, contributing member of society with renewed purpose and the ability to eventually help others.<br/></p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>Forward March
will address the individual's Mind, Body and Spirit. It will heal the heart, repair
broken relationships, as well as renew a person’s own reason for living, restore purpose and create passion.</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>We will
eventually consist of many satellite facilities throughout the country,
especially in high veteran concentrated areas.</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>Forward March’s
comprehensive long intake &amp; evaluation procedure ensures every
participant is treated as in individual, which believe it or not is “Ground Breaking”.</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>Our program has
an entity entitled “Guts &amp; Gurus”, which consists of obtaining the services of
famous experts who volunteer their passion, time and skills to those veterans that share those same interests.  This could be considered similar to the USO “concerts for troops” program,

</span>Every year,

among the three leading causes of death among those aged 15-44 years in some
countries, and the second leading cause of death in the 10-24 years age group;

</span>41% of veterans
are diagnosed with mental health or behavioral health problems. 20% of veterans
are diagnosed with the injury called PTSD.</p>

struggled with severe depression, suicide attempts, family isolation, etc.   These veterans are all ages from all conflict
eras.  We approach each client with open arms, no judgements and 100% love and acceptance.  Our foundation starts with forgiveness and patience.  Our program is unique and when an individual is committed, we are 100% successful in improving their life. </p>
<p>Our program's mission is to expand both at our current location and nationally. </p>

  Us 
·We are in the trenches caring for veterans 24/7.
Our standard of care is built on the famous quote by JFK- ""As we express our gratitude, we must never forget that the highest appreciation is not to utter words, but to live by them."" - John F. Kennedy 
We operate an assisted & independent living
facility & wellness center for veterans with mental health issues such as anxiety, depression,
PTSD, etc that were homeless, or are at risk of being homeless, That have
struggled with severe depression, suicide attempts, family isolation, etc.   These veterans are all ages from all conflict
eras.  We approach each client with open arms, no judgements and 100% love and acceptance.  Our foundation starts with forgiveness and patience.  Our program is unique and when an individual is committed, we are 100% successful in improving their life. 
Our program's mission is to expand both at our current location and nationally. 
Through our program, veterans have the opportunity  to reach a level of living well, being healthy and
enjoying life. Long term suicide and homelessness prevention is ensured.
They deserve the best, and we have created it-""Forward March""

Thanks to everyone! We've reached 165% of our goal!
This has been a great experience, we've made many friends and talked with awesome people!
You can now order Hexoskin on our official website.
What is Hexoskin?
Hexoskin is the first wearable movement, respiration, and heart activity tracker. Hexoskin tracks your health and gives you insights about your activities, your sleep, your life's choices.
""The Hexoskin has the advantage of being a simple shirt and not something clunky like an armband"" -- Crunchwear
""Hexoskin is a sensor-filled smart shirt that offers significantly more health data than a basic fitness tracker like a Fitbit Flex."" -- Digital Trends

""Hexoskin has lined up an impressive list of beta testers."" -- Crowdfundinsider

""This shirt could be the future of fitness tracking"" -- AskMen.com

""Hexoskin’s applications go beyond collecting stats during physical training and could be used as a constant companion."" -- Gizmag
""Thrilled about the opportunity this offers for research, medical monitoring, the quantified self and art and design."" -- GigaOM

""They envision a future where constant, passive health monitoring through smart clothes will feed in to big data applications and predictive analytics"" -- Forbes

A big thanks to Sampo Laaksonen from Finland who helped us cross the goal! Keep on sharing the campaign with others you know might be interested!
Simple
Put on the shirt, plug your device, and your body metrics are displayed on your phone and uploaded in your account. Sleep, be active, live.




Safe
The shirt connects to a small and lightweight device that fits in a pocket on the waist. There is no device on your chest, which makes it safe for activities ranging from sleep to contact sports.

Sophisticated
It does a lot more than your old heart rate strap, without the strap. Its trio of sensors offers a high-quality ECG signal, the most precise breathing volume measurement, and movement sensors that measure activity, steps, cadence, and sleep position.


Connected
When you wear the shirt, your health stats are digitized and uploaded in real-time. You can get detailed reports on your training and general health in a web browser on any device:

Training reports and training programs
Activity and stress levels during the day
Sleep quality reports

Get a clear view of your overall performance and reports on your progress. See your trainings in details, like you've never seen them before.




Individual Training
Hexoskin Solo is our personal training app. When we'll ship your Hexoskin, the app will come with these tools:

Programmable training plan (create and share).
GPS training tools with waypoints activated trainings.
Interval training based on physiological response.
Display real-time data (including ECG and breathing).
Connect to smart watches and glasses.

 
Team Training
Hexoskin Team is our team training app. If you're a trainer, this app allows you to program, time and annotate athlete training routines. Time groups of athletes simultaneously. No more juggling with stopwatches.You can be connected to 3 Hexoskin data streams in real-time using the app.

See how Hexoskin compares to traditional training monitoring tools.





Sleep
Your body speaks when you sleep. Hexoskin has all the sensors you need for precise sleep monitoring. Measure sleep efficiency, position changes, breathing, and heart rate at rest.





Free, Unlimited Data Storage. Forever.
Hexoskin can record more than 3 million data points per hour. To make sure you never lose your data, we offer you free, unlimited data storage. 
Open == Transparent
Hexoskin is simple to use and its apps are powerful, but we also wanted Hexoskin to be open for hobbyists and 3rd party apps. 
Here is what we will make available for those who want to develop Hexoskin software:

Open web API: access to full data, including raw data.





Connect to Other Apps
The Hexoskin API tools will make it easy to connect to your favorite training and tracking apps.



Share trainings on Facebook and Twitter.

Sync with RunKeeper or Withings.


Track with IFTTT, Tictrac, Dashbook, Open.Sen.se, HumanAPI.

Export your data and use it with research tools such as VivoSense by Vivonoetics, R or Octave.
Tell us which app you would like to be supported!

Join our developer community: api@hexoskin.com










Notes: mobile apps are included will all perks, phone is shown to illustrate the app only. All Federal, Provincial and State taxes are extra where applicable.

Why Indiegogo?
After years of development, and tests by research groups, professionals, amateur athletes, but also inactive people, we've decided to make this technology available for all at an affordable price. By contributing to this campaign, you helped us get the production volume we need to lower the price to 399$.
The Team
Here are the awesome people working on this project!

<p>My name is Chelene, I am 23 years old, and have just been diagnosed with T Cell Lymphoma for the second time in 2 years. The first time I was diagnosed with stage 3 T Cell Lymphoma, was in July 2010.</p>
<p>I became severely sick and was hospitalized. After 16 days of grueling test, exams, blood work, the doctors discovered I had T Cell Lymphoma. During the next 4 months I received 6 rounds of chemo therapy, and Neupogen shots. The combination of these treatments was absolutely devastating to my body and the aftermath left me with Neuropathy, which is nerve damage that affects my arms and legs. I finally went into remission in November of 2010.</p>
<p>Now my T Cell Lymphoma cancer is back and my doctors have no stage to label my cancer, the doctors are taking an aggressive approach to treatment. I currently undergoing treatment and have begun on May 14th, consisiting of chemotherpy, injections, blood work, and scans, following by a stem cell transplant that will be held at Usc.</p>
<p>With the reaccurance of my cancer along with the neuropathy, my working hours depleted and I am currently unable to work due to my condition, and undering going treatment.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<p>Before my first treatments, my doctors recommended that I harvest and freeze my eggs. I choose not to. This time it was highly recommend to harvest and freeze my eggs, seeing on how my body will not produce any after this. With the gerouse help, support, and sponcers, I was able to havrvest and freeze a small number of eggs, better than none :)</p>
<p>After being independent and out on my own, I have had to move back in with my parents. Both my parents are hard working, blue collar, people who struggle financially every month, just like most of us do. My first round with cancer drained what little savings my parents had and now I am faced with, God only knows what kind of medical debt will come.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What I Am Asking</strong></p>
<p>As of right now I am still receiving phone calls and letters daily and weekly from debt collectors, still not knowing how to pay them, or the on coming debt. My goal is to raise $5,000. The money that I will be receiving from all of you wonderful and generous people will be used to help pay for my chemo, bone marrow transplant, medication, picc line, injections, lab testing, scan testing, co-pays, and gas to and from my treatments.</p>
<p>I would like to say thank you to all of those who have helped and who are helping. A few dollars might not seem like much, but those few dollars could pay for another injection, or test that is needed, and is more of a blessing than you know. I would also like to say thank you to everyone for all of your love, support, prayers, wishes, and thoughts, they are more appreciated than you know!!! :D</p>

<p>Hi, my name is Deborah Slocum I am an innocent victim of a drunk driver. </p>
<p>My accident occurred in June, 1984 and I am still having medical problems with my throat that need to be addressed. </p>
<p>For the past 28 years I have had 90 plus surgeries and it is still ongoing.  My most serious injury was a crushed larynx and vocal cord damage.  I have traveled all over the USA to receive care at USF in Tampa, Baylor College of Medicine in Houston TX, Tulane University and Hospital in New Orleans. LA and the Institute for Laryngeal Surgery &amp; Voice Rehabilitation along with Harvard Medical School and Massachusetts General Hospital.</p>
<p>My throat is so complicated not everyone will even touch it, not even my ENT here.  I have complications with scar tissue and need to have another tracheal resection done.  This time they will use a section of aorta (which does not develop scar tissue) to help rebuild my throat so I can breathe easier and take the stress off my heart and lungs and help my body to function a bit easier.   My throat now is only 3cm, equivalent to that of an infant, not a 58 year old woman.</p>
<p>We now need your financial help to pay for the costs of my <strong>upcoming trips to Boston</strong> which includes co-pays, airfare, hotel stays, taxis, food etc.   If there is any way you can assist me, please, please find it in your heart to help with contributions. </p>

<p>Blue Ridge Treks is a new therapeutic partnership between Clinical Social Workers Alex Hersey and Joe Early II.  Based in Asheville, NC and utilizing natural resources of the Pisgah National Forest and the Blue Ridge Parkway, Blue Ridge Trek's mission is to provide a clinical liaison between traditional outpatient therapy and wilderness therapy.  Joe and Alex believe in developing a strong sense of self, strong relationships with others, health and connection with nature.  To this end, Blue Ridge Treks will provide weekly individual and family therapy sessions, weekly wellness hikes in the Asheville area, and monthly overnight backpacking treks.</p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Individual - Individual clients will have the opportunity to spend 18 days in wilderness settings through our backpacking trips, covering 75 miles and summiting at least seven 6,000 foot peaks, including the highest peak in the Eastern United States.  Additionally, they will have the chance to hike at least 100 miles along the Blue Ridge Parkway on our weekly wellness hikes. These outdoor components serve to enhance self-growth, relationships and communication worked on during weekly therapy sessions.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Families - In addition to family therapy sessions, which will focus on communication and problem-solving skills, Blue Ridge Treks hopes to introduce wilderness experiences as a means to create positive family experiences. Our hopes are to impact families through increased positive communication and experiences.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Community - The community within and surrounding Asheville will benefit from monthly service days led by founders Alex and Joe.  Youth will be introduced to various service opportunities in the community as well as learning Leave No Trace principals on outdoor excursions.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>What we need...we plan on using these funds to purchase backpacks, sleeping bags and pads, water filtration systems and other necessary gear for backpacking treks.  We will work with a locally owned outfitter in procuring our gear to benefit the local economy as much as possible. We will also use these funds to purchase a 16 passenger van to transport youth to and from wellness hikes and treks.  We believe by providing gear and transportation we will widen the circle of youth who can participate in our programs.  Any funds not immediately spent on gear or transportation will go towards scholarships for trekkers.  If we do not reach our goal, Alex and Joe will continue fundraising as well as using business profits to meet Blue Ridge Treks' needs.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>What you get...we have some great designs from Hamilton Creations that will be put on first edition bumper stickers, t-shirts, water bottles and sweatshirts for your much-needed donations.</p>

<p>We believe in a world in which people don't have to worry about how to obtain water or whether it will make them sick. What would your life be like if you had to worry about this every day? 1.1 billion people around the world do. The facts don't have to read like this, however. We have a more positive outcome in mind: Reducing water shortages and water-related disease burdens by conducting targeted, community-health interventions.</p>
<p>Please donate to our current project, which aims to improve the water supply in <strong>Belen</strong>, an impoverished community of Iquitos, Peru. Thanks in advance for your interest and support!</p>
<h3><strong>Our Story  </strong></h3>
<p>We are four first-year medical students from Penn State College of Medicine: Sara Abu-Tabikh, Derek Reighard, Jenny Rice, and Hannah Ross-Suits. We are continuing the research and community activism that last year’s Iquitos group started (<a href=""http://www.indiegogo.com/waterforiquitos?a=126306"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.indiegogo.com/waterforiquitos?a=126306</a>). </p>
<p>This year, we’ll be working exclusively in the <strong>Belen Municipality</strong> of Iquitos, Peru, investigating water use, hygiene practices, and traditional medicine for treating gastrointestinal illness, in addition to training community health workers in oral rehydration therapy.</p>
<p>We will spend several weeks conducting surveys, analyzing water sources and stool samples for various contaminants, and talking to locals about their health practices and concerns. We will be training Iquitos-based health promoters as advocates of oral rehydration therapy. At the conclusion of our project, we will present the data to Peruvian health officials -- as well as to Penn State's Global Health Office -- and they will use that data to implement broader initiatives.<strong> </strong></p>
<p>We are all incredibly excited to be traveling to Iquitos this summer. To get to know us better, click on our individual tabs below or check out our blog!  <a href=""http://waterforiquitos.blogspot.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" title="""">http://waterforiquitos.blogspot.com/</a></p>
<h3><strong>The Impact   </strong></h3>
<p>Poor sanitation can lead to a wide variety of diseases that cause significant morbidity and mortality. <em>Giardia</em>, <em>Cryptosporidium</em>, and roundworm are some examples of diseases that thrive in areas of poor sanitation and can cause serious harm or even death to their victims. Each of these diseases occurs or has occurred in or around Belen.</p>
<p>In the Belen Municipality of Iquitos, Peru, many people do not have access to running water or clean, treated water. Many must obtain their water from nearby rivers, which may or may not be contaminated with the diseases mentioned above. The inhabitants in all of these communities face significant barriers to obtaining one of the most fundamental human needs: potable water.</p>
<p>It is our goal to assess household water collection, sanitation infrastructure, and hygiene practices. We will then implement an intervention to help encourage oral rehydration therapy and slow gastrointestinal disease rates seen in these regions.</p>
<p>This project will serve as a tremendous learning opportunity for the whole team, fostering compassion for those in underserved areas and developing leadership skills and team-building as we work together toward a common goal. We firmly believe that there exists real potential to provide the people of Belen with the clean drinking water they deserve.</p>
<p>It is our sincere hope that our efforts in Belen will (1) help to educate other medical students about the many implications of water in society, (2) result in a friendly alliance between Penn State College of Medicine and Belen/Iquitos community members, and (3) pave the way for future health interventions in Belen and throughout the Iquitos region.</p>
<h3><strong>What We Need  </strong></h3>
<p>As we are medical students, we must rely on grants and donations in order to make our travels possible. Each team member will require a roundtrip flight to Iquitos (about $900 each). While in Iquitos, we will need to account for daily expenses: housing ($500 total for 4 weeks), food ($100 each), and transport ($50 each). That makes for a grand total of $4700 (yikes!). Good news: we've already been awarded a small travel grant from The Kienle Center for the Humanities at Penn State, so we are seeking to help cover at least $2,600. <strong> </strong></p>
<p><em><strong>Every dollar helps! If you are in a position to give, please consider contributing to our cause. Thank you in advance for your support!</strong></em></p>
<h3><strong>Other Ways You Can Help </strong></h3>
<p>Spread the news to your family, friends, and coworkers!</p>
<p>If anyone has expertise in water engineering or sustainable water development in Latin America (or elsewhere!) and has advice, don't hesitate to post it on our comments section, or simply send us a message! We'd love to hear from you. With this collaborative effort, we can make this project an incredible success! </p></div>","Our Vision

<h3>Yoga for Senior Citizens</h3>
<p>I have been supporting myself teaching yoga in the St Helena community for 12 years. Finding a space to rent  that I can afford has always been a challenge. Several years ago, I was asked by Grace Episcopal Church to teach my yoga classes there. They have a beautiful, large room to accomodate a lot of students. I have always practiced Karma Yoga, and every month the class picks a charity of their choice to donate a percentage of the months revenue to. </p>
<p>Last year, the vestry comittee increased the rent I was paying for the room by over 300% from $20 to $75. In addition, the vestry required me to become sponsored by a non-profit orginazation to fullfill their by laws. This means I now have to pay the non profit each month as well as  Grace. The amount of money I receive each month is based on the number of class cards sold, not the actual attendance. To cover this rent increase, the obligation to the non profit, and my monthly expenses means i need to sell 30 cards a month. I average 10-15 cards a month, last month was 9. For the past year, one patron has been helping to cover the additional cost. This is not available for this year, so I am hoping many people can give a little instead of one person giving a tremendous amount.</p>
<p>I also found out last year, when I offered classes to senior citizens at a reduced cost, that even paying a small amount on a  fixed income was difficult for them. I know Yoga will help seniors to feel better and increase their quality of movement, and life.</p>
<p>With this campaign, the rent for the room at Grace will be covered for one year, I can continue to support myself teaching yoga, and I can offer classes to St. Helena senior citizens for free.</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I need $5,200.</p>
<p>The rent for the room to teach yoga is $75/ day and I teach 2 classes a week $150 week x 52 weeks a year = $7,800. </p>
<p>I will pay rent of $25 / class - $50/ week x 52 weeks/ year= $2,600.</p>
<p>By contributing to this campaign, you will be providing free classes to senior citizens on a fixed income, get yoga classes for yourself and audio cd's of my yoga classes to put on your ipod and have yoga on-the-go! Also, private yoga instruction via web cam.</p>
<p>Any and all amounts funded to this campaign will go to rent the room to teach yoga. If I receive more than the $5,200, it will go towards next years rent.</p>
<p>I have always charged reasonable rates for my yoga classes so students can attend often, and benefit from an ongoing practice. By recieving assistance with the rent cost, I can continue to provide yoga classes for everyone to afford, and to be able to support myself.</p>

For the new year i would like to smile again. As long as i can remember  I have had problems with my teeth and have scared to go to the dentist. 2014 is my year to over come my fears and  get my smile back. I am still young and have two daughters i would like to enjoy life with them . I am embarrassed  to be seen out in public and i don't do a lot of things  outside my home . I am living on a fixed income and don't have a lot of money after rent and bills . This is my big goal for 2014 and  all your help with  this  is  so appreciated !About 6 months ago I did go to the dentist to get a tooth pulled due to pain and they said  that the  rest had to go as well and gave me  a price sheet with everything  that had to be done. I just looked at it and cried. It was  a little over 3 grand.  thats where you can help me out. I plan on video blogging everything  and you can follow me there to see where i am in the process.The impact on my life with be huge.

<p class=""p1"">On Christmas Day 2012, just nine months of age, Lucas had his first seizure. He was rushed by ambulance to Sick Kids Hospital where a team of doctors and nurses attended to him and were able to control his seizure, which at that point had been ongoing for over an hour. Lucas was hospitalized for 24 hours. Two days after being discharged, Lucas experienced another prolonged seizure episode that returned us back to the emergency room.</p>
<p class=""p1"">We immediately noticed visible set backs in Lucas' development. He lost functional usage of the right side of his body, reduced vision in his right eye and decreased responsiveness. </p>
<p class=""p1"">To help control his seizures, Lucas was placed on anti-seizure medication which the doctors informed us he would have to be on for the rest of his life.  </p>
<p class=""p1"">In April 2013, Lucas started experiencing stroke-like episodes, where he would lose total usage of the right side of his body. He was placed on a low dose of Aspirin to manage this, in addition to his seizure medication.</p>
<p class=""p1"">In June 2013, Lucas began suffering from another type of seizure that could not be controlled by the meds he was currently on. He was once again rushed to Sick Kids for a battery of tests. An EEG confirmed that Lucas was experiencing this new type of seizure and was put on new medication in addition to his current medication.</p>
<p class=""p1"">His medication dosage has been increasing on a weekly basis, as his seizures are yet to be controlled. As a result, Lucas has fallen many times and suffered from bruises, cuts and black eyes which have compromised his safety. </p>
<p class=""p1"">In addition to his seizures, Lucas faces another difficult challenge of developing glaucoma throughout his life. Currently, he has developed right homonymous hemianopia, which further impacts his balance and safety.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Lucas can have up to 9 appointments in a given month with various medical specialists. However, he is currently on several waitlists for many healthcare services that are essential for his development. The costs associated with these services and the time off required from work has resulted in lost income and has taken a toll on his parents.</p>
<p class=""p1"">In February 2013, we were informed that Lucas had been accepted into a wonderful program at Centennial Infant and Child Centre (CICC) that provides all the therapeutic services he needs under one roof.</p>
<p class=""p1"">While CICC is a non-profit charitable organization and fundraises in order to help bring the cost down, the tuition fee for the 2013 - 2014 school year equates to $5750 not including the $4500 fee for transportation or afternoon daycare costs. Extended health benefits do not pay for this type of program. We have explored other funding sources but unfortunately Lucas does not qualify for these or any government based subsidized childcare. Lucas' parents are challenged financially to be able to afford this program for their son – a program that has shown to have great results. His parents, have been on an emotional roller coaster with Lucas’ health. We are seeking your assistance to obtain funding to make an immediate impact in Lucas’ development. At this time any support is greatly appreciated.</p>

<p>My name is Christy Connelly and I am posting this fundraiser in an effort to help my dear friends, the Dunn family.  Any contributions will be greatly appreciated and will help them with the high medical expenses accumulated (and will continue to accumulate) in caring for their beautiful 6 month old daughter, Lilyana.</p>
<p> Lilyana was born with one functioning kidney. Her other kidney is non functioning and is <em>Multicystic Dysplastic. </em>Lilyana was diagnosed as having Grade 4 Reflux which causes recurrent urinary tract infections (UTI). She was diagnosed with her first UTI at 7 weeks old. The Doctors recommended surgery to correct the Reflux to keep her one functioning kidney from becoming damaged by the recurrent infections.  If her kidney were to become scarred, it could result in long term renal illness (which could lead to the need for a kidney transplant). They decided to proceed with the surgery after Lilyana spent 9 days in the hospital for a nasty UTI that was only treatable by IV antibiotics .  As hard as it is to see your 2 month old infant go into open surgery, they wanted their sweet baby to enjoy life symptom free and to keep her one functioning kidney healthy.</p>
<p> The surgery did not go off without a hitch. The stent that was placed in her ureter did not function properly, and this caused Lilyana to go into ""apparent renal failure"" within 24 hours of her surgery. The Doctors performed an emergency surgery to drain her kidney, and they had to place a nephrostomy tube in her kidney to save her life. The nephrostomy tube stayed in her kidney for about a month and a half. Immediately after they completed the surgery, they found that her red blood cells had fallen dangerously low, and she needed an emergency blood transfusion. The family then spent another 7 days in the hospital for Lilyana to recover well enough to come home. When she was released from the hospital the nephrostomy tube was still in place.  Several weeks later Lilyana had another surgery to remove the stent. The neprostomy tube was finally removed several weeks later.  We all held high hopes that the infections were behind Lilyana and that she was on the road to live a more normal babyhood.</p>
<p> Not the case. Lilyana continues to have recurrent UTIs and is still undergoing tests. The doctors are not sure what the cause is. Her  doctors are watching an abnormality in the anatomy of Lilyana’s ureter that was found in surgery. We pray this ""abnormality"" will not require further surgeries and procedures but we won't know for a few more months. Her multicystic kidney will be monitored as well. The hope for the multicystic kidney is that it will shrink and go away on it's own without causing any problems. The other possibility is the multicystic kidney can grow and may need to be removed surgically.</p>
<p> The Dunn family may need to travel for health care in another city if her condition does not improve.Mom has not left Lilyana’s side and she has not been able to go back to work. Daycare is not an option because of Lilyana’s condition.</p>
<p> The Dunns will do whatever it takes to get Lilyana healthy. She is a happy baby despite everything she has been through. Her smiles will touch the most distant of hearts. She is loved more than words can say.</p>
<p> Thank you for reading her story. The Dunns are grateful for your caring and generosity. They strive to be positive and know Lilyana will continue to thrive no matter what obstacles may be thrown their way.</p>

made it possible to play golf over the Internet are planning a new game.
Internet Golf Multimedia Inc. here hopes to launch next year the Java-based
Internet Sports Computer (ISC), which will handle both golf and </span><a href=""http://www.eetimes.com/General/PrintView/4039584"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" style=""line-height: 1.45em;""> interactive sports</a><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""> that
""volley"" by recording and relaying the players' muscle contractions
in real-time.</span></p><br/><p>The company's original smart golf club, the
Genius, enabled opponents to remotely play golf against each other on a PC by
measuring their real-world performance in hitting a real ball. The ISC, by
contrast, will be a freestanding, <a href=""http://www.eetimes.com/General/PrintView/4039584"" rel=""noopener nofollow""> wireless</a> unit that expands
beyond golf to a more generic format capable of representing a variety of
one-on-one games — basketball, tennis, racket ball or even a one-on-one
baseball variant that is illegal everywhere except cyberspace.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the Internet Sports Computer
includes the hardware for real-time transmission of motion information in games
where both players are acting simultaneously-such as tennis volleys.
Sophisticated motion analysis routines are being put into a custom chip, said
the company, to animate a figure on the screen. The animated figure can be used
to pinpoint problems with the movements in a swing.</p>
<p>Where the Genius golf club uses PC software
along with a couple of ASICs and an RF transceiver, the freestanding ISC has an
embedded microprocessor. The smart club (or a smart racket) will communicate
with the belt-pack-mounted ISC, which in turn uses a wireless communications
strategy to access the Internet.</p>
<p>For the future, the ISC will supplement
its <a href=""http://www.eetimes.com/General/PrintView/4039584"" rel=""noopener nofollow""> <b>golf
putter</b></a> with
a new driver model and a new line of wireless tennis rackets, baseball bats,
basketballs and other smart sports gear. Because each device is wireless, the
clubs, rackets and bats can be taken outdoors, Murdock pointed out.</p>
<p>""Eventually we hope to mediate not just
one-to-one <a href=""http://www.eetimes.com/General/PrintView/4039584"" rel=""noopener nofollow""> contests</a>, but contests among
thousands of different players worldwide,"" said Murdock.</p>

Who we are?
We
are a special group of young and middle age visionaries, dedicated, hardworking
and passionate Graduate Students, Senior Engineers, and Seasoned Business
People. Wireless Week. — The folks who
made it possible to play golf over the Internet are planning a new game.
Internet Golf Multimedia Inc. here hopes to launch next year the Java-based
Internet Sports Computer (ISC), which will handle both golf and  interactive sports that
""volley"" by recording and relaying the players' muscle contractions
in real-time.The company's original smart golf club, the
Genius, enabled opponents to remotely play golf against each other on a PC by
measuring their real-world performance in hitting a real ball. The ISC, by
contrast, will be a freestanding,  wireless unit that expands
beyond golf to a more generic format capable of representing a variety of
one-on-one games — basketball, tennis, racket ball or even a one-on-one
baseball variant that is illegal everywhere except cyberspace.
On the other hand, the Internet Sports Computer
includes the hardware for real-time transmission of motion information in games
where both players are acting simultaneously-such as tennis volleys.
Sophisticated motion analysis routines are being put into a custom chip, said
the company, to animate a figure on the screen. The animated figure can be used
to pinpoint problems with the movements in a swing.
Where the Genius golf club uses PC software
along with a couple of ASICs and an RF transceiver, the freestanding ISC has an
embedded microprocessor. The smart club (or a smart racket) will communicate
with the belt-pack-mounted ISC, which in turn uses a wireless communications
strategy to access the Internet.
For the future, the ISC will supplement
its  golf
putter with
a new driver model and a new line of wireless tennis rackets, baseball bats,
basketballs and other smart sports gear. Because each device is wireless, the
clubs, rackets and bats can be taken outdoors, Murdock pointed out.
""Eventually we hope to mediate not just
one-to-one  contests, but contests among
thousands of different players worldwide,"" said Murdock.
