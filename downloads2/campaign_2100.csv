The exhibition, named after Ravikovitch’s 1964 poem of the same name, brings together artists whose work addresses the stoicism, disillusionment and hope in contemporary Israeli society. We will be sourcing a book of poems by writers worldwide in response to the exhibiting artworks, to be read and distributed throughout the exhibition. </p><p><strong>Dahlia Ravikovitch</strong> (1936 – 2005) was the first major female Hebrew poet of her generation and one of the most celebrated poets in Israeli history. Admired for her artistry, courage and peace activism, her prolific writings remain among the most preeminent of the Israeli literary canon. A love poet, mother, feminist and outspoken opposer of discrimination in Israel, Ravikovitch represented the duality of aggression versus fragility that permeates the Israeli psyche. The aim of this exhibition is to provide a visual component to Ravikovitch’s powerful poetry, and to depict the eternal clash between what a human ideal could be and what it actually is.                 </p><p> </p><p><strong>//ARTISTS</strong></p><p>Exhibiting artists include the extraordinarily talented, wonderful and supportive Sheffy Bleier, Dvora Morag, Nelly Agassi, Inbal Hoffman, Michal Ohana-Cole and Karen Anavy.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1479551409/q6zmmoikcccnwtwmclnl.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>Inbal Hoffman, <i>Dark Matter</i>, installation </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1479551960/z5jbegl8n42jinencop8.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>Sheffy Bleier, from the series <i>Garden of Organs</i></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1479552000/yjpj4y4j7vsyiowjm0lz.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>Dvora Morag, <i>Phantom </i></p><p><strong>//PHILOSOPHY</strong></p><p>The Roar of Waters emphasises a creative language taking place outside of the conventional narrative.

</div><div> <h3>Was du uns gibst &amp; was du bekommst</h3> <p>Wir brauchen rund 35.000 EUR für den Ausbau unserer bereits vorhandenen Werkstatt.</p>
<p>Wir schaffen es aber auch mit weniger - wir sind Improvisationstalente. Jeder Euro, den du uns zukommen lässt (abzüglich Steuern und Gebühren) fließt in den Aufbau unseres Traums, auch wenn wir das Ziel nicht erreichen.</p>
<p>Dafür erhältst du im Rahmen dieses Crowdfundings einzigartige Perks, die wir nie wieder in dieser Form und zu diesem Preis anbieten werden. Neugierig? Schau dir die Perks an! Bilder davon findest du hier in unserer Galerie.</p>
</div><p> </p><h3>Pilotprojekte</h3><p> </p><p>Um zu zeigen, was wir können, haben wir zwei Pilotprojekte gebaut.</p><p>Eher aus dem Bereich LARP/Rüstungsbau ist das Projekt ""Armouring the Heavens"". Eher im Bereich Fashion/Erotik zu verorten sind unsere ""Dark Desires"". Beide Projekte könnt ihr auf unserer Facebook-Seite (@MetalArtisan) bewundern.</p><div>
<p>  </p>
<p> </p>

<p> </p>
<h3>What do you get in return for your participation?<br/> </h3>

<ul>
<li>Bursary for artists.</li>
<li>Exhibition at OVADA, Oxford.</li>
<li>Mentoring from industry professionals.</li>
<li>Assistance with technical development and marketing of their work.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is a great chance to provide artists embarking on a new career with valuable professional experience.</p>
<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<p>The basics:</p>
<ul>
<li>DAR is applying for Arts Council funding to make this possible, however it needs valuable funding upfront to make that application possible. Your funding will be absolutely essential to getting this project off the ground!</li>
<li>In return: get a limited edition Digital artwork and/or an invitation to the private view.</li>
<li>All funds go towards making the residency and exhibition possible. Thanks to you, young artists will get paid to develop their project; with the help of mentorship, publicity and technical expertise along the way.</li>
</ul>
<p>In more detail: The Emerging Artist in Residence scheme will provide support and funding for upcoming artists (these could include students or recent graduates) to create and realise a new project with digital media. Artists will be selected through an ‘open call’ process based on the quality of the proposed project. The commissioned works will be exhibited online on DAR’s dedicated website which acts as a personal space for artists to create and develop the new works. DAR is a new initiative but has been producing ambitious digital projects for over 14 months.</p>
<p>The artists will also have a chance to develop these works further with an exhibition at OVADA. DAR will also provide support in the form of mentoring as well as promotional support to help the artist nurture a professional network. The grant will contribute towards staffing costs for managing the project and a stipend to help artists with materials and pay for their time.</p>
<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<p>This could make a huge difference to the emerging artists involved. It would help give artists the necessary funds to make work. It will give them a chance to show case their work on an international stage with mentorship from professionals and publicity. DAR supported digital artists throughout its development and believes in fair and proper pay for artists.</p>
<p><strong>Risks &amp; Challenges</strong></p>
<p>The Emerging Artist-in-Residence will require further Arts Council funding to make this possible and there is a chance it the project may not get funded if it doesn’t raise the required match-funding to qualify it for an ACE grant.

<p>SINOPSIS</p>
<p>“Sucede que soy horrible” original del escritor venezolano Gustavo Ott cuenta la historia de una familia dónde la carrera política del padre es la columna vertebral de la obra. Llevan diez años en el poder, y a raíz de un hecho contundente la dinámica familiar cambia. Las circunstancias a las que se enfrentan se tornan protagonistas. Nos muestran distintas realidades a través de las decisiones que toman: vigentes, universales y humanas. “Sucede que soy horrible”, escrita y publicada en 1983 es estrenada mundialmente por primera vez en el marco del festival de jóvenes directores del Trasnocho Cultural en Caracas, Venezuela.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> ¿Por qué ésta obra?</p>
<p>Porque 34 años después de su publicación sigue vigente con respecto a lo que somos y vivimos los venezolanos, resulta una historia premonitoria políticamente hablando. Aunque lo realmente apasionante, y he aquí el tema central,  las relaciones humanas que se muestran a través de la familia Silva.</p>
<p>Gustavo Ott es uno de los dramaturgos paisanos más representados en la actualidad del teatro Venezolano y es un honor realizar en estreno la pieza “Sucede que soy horrible”.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>BIO</p>
<p>Sareni Siplenko tiene 24 años. Ex campeona nacional en la disciplina deportiva de Tiro Olímpico con armas cortas. Apasionada del arte culinario y el cine. Actualmente  estudiante de comunicación social.</p>
<p>Inició su formación en el mundo de las artes con “El Teatro Profesional de Lara”. Es actriz egresada del “Gimnasio de Actores” dirigido por Matilda Corral (egresada del Actors Studio). Ha participado en talleres especializados  con la metodología de Sanford Meisner, Uta Hagen y Stella Adler.</p>
<p>En el marco del festival de jóvenes directores del 2018 en Caracas, Venezuela, presenta la pieza “Sucede que soy horrible” del venezolano Gustavo Ott, en su primera representación teatral.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>SYNOPSIS</p>
<p>""It happens that I am horrible"" original from the Venezuelan writer Gustavo Ott. It tells the story of a family which father's political career is the backbone of the work. They have been in power for ten years already, and as a result of a forceful event, family dynamics changes. The circumstances they face become protagonists. They show us different realities through the decisions they take: current, universal and human. ""It happens that I am horrible"", written and published in 1983, is premiered worldwide for the first time in the framework of the festival of young directors of Trasnocho Cultural in Caracas Venezuela.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>WHY THIS WORK?</p>

</div></div>","SINOPSIS
“Sucede que soy horrible” original del escritor venezolano Gustavo Ott cuenta la historia de una familia dónde la carrera política del padre es la columna vertebral de la obra. Llevan diez años en el poder, y a raíz de un hecho contundente la dinámica familiar cambia. Las circunstancias a las que se enfrentan se tornan protagonistas. Nos muestran distintas realidades a través de las decisiones que toman: vigentes, universales y humanas. “Sucede que soy horrible”, escrita y publicada en 1983 es estrenada mundialmente por primera vez en el marco del festival de jóvenes directores del Trasnocho Cultural en Caracas, Venezuela.
 
 ¿Por qué ésta obra?
Porque 34 años después de su publicación sigue vigente con respecto a lo que somos y vivimos los venezolanos, resulta una historia premonitoria políticamente hablando. Aunque lo realmente apasionante, y he aquí el tema central,  las relaciones humanas que se muestran a través de la familia Silva.
Gustavo Ott es uno de los dramaturgos paisanos más representados en la actualidad del teatro Venezolano y es un honor realizar en estreno la pieza “Sucede que soy horrible”.

<h3><strong>¿De qué va Luces en el Mar? What is Lights on the Sea About?</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Spanish version:</strong></p>
<p>«Fue un rayo el desencadenante de todo…». Así empieza Luces en el mar, una emocionante novela que cuenta la historia de Harold y Mary Rose Grapes, un matrimonio que, tras la trágica muerte de su hijo, dejó a un lado sus sueños de juventud y se resignó a vivir en una isla remota, alejados de todo.</p>
<p>Ahora, el destino les vuelve a poner a prueba y se ven forzados a abandonar su hogar de una manera que nunca habrían imaginado. Justo la noche antes de ser desahuciados, por un problema de delimitación de costas, mientras Harold y Rose duermen, se desata una fuerte tormenta y un rayo hace que la casa se desprenda del acantilado y caiga al mar con ellos dentro.</p>
<p>De la forma más inesperada, los Grapes se convierten en dos náufragos a la deriva sobre una casa flotante. Comienza así un extraordinario viaje en el que deberán luchar juntos frente a las adversidades si quieren sobrevivir. Olvidarse de los fantasmas y frustraciones del pasado es imprescindible.</p>
<p><strong>English version:</strong></p>
<p>On the highest point of an island, in a house clinging to the edge of a cliff, live Mary Rose and Harold Grapes, a retired couple still mourning the death of their son thirty-five years before. Weighed down by decades of grief and memories, the Grapes have never moved past the tragedy. Then, on the eve of eviction from the most beautiful and dangerously unstable perch in the area, they’re uprooted by a violent storm. The disbelieving Grapes and their home take a free-fall slide into the white-capped sea and float away.</p>
<p>As the past that once moored them recedes and disappears, Mary Rose and Harold are delivered from decades of sorrow by the ebb and flow of the waves. Ahead of them, a light shimmers on the horizon, guiding them toward a revelatory and cathartic new engagement with life, and all its wonder.</p>
<p>Wildly imaginative, deeply poignant, and entirely unexpected, Lights on the Sea sweeps readers away on a journey of fate, acceptance, redemption, and survival against the most rewarding of odds.</p>

Our passion for experimenting with unconventional ingredients and flavor profiles gives our customers the chance to sip on brews such as our Chocolate Macadamia Nut Stout, Passion Fruit Green Tea Ale, and our Hoptastic Voyage single hop IPA series, just to name a few. No matter how many times you go to our nanobrewery, each visit will feel different thanks to an ever-changing selection of 18–20 brews on tap, rotating galleries of local artwork, custom LED lights that regularly change the color and mood of the taproom, and food-pairing events with local chefs and food trucks.</p>

<h3><strong>Overview</strong></h3>
<p>Per os is a research-based art project about the pharmaceutical companies' role in our society, psychiatry and healthcare. Using surveys I have conducted over the past three years and a large amount of anger at how wrong and corrupt the system is, I would like to interpret  this research artistically in order to develop material for an exhibition. The aim of this exhibition is to highlight the research content of the project and to raise awareness. In the exhibition there will be direct references to existing research, studies and articles as well as my own activist surveys over the past three years that you can read more about below.</p>
<p>I am currently in the process of fleshing out the project's contextual framework through studies at <a href=""https://uu.se/en/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Uppsala University</a> and I have just finished studies at <a href=""https://mau.se/en/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Malmö University</a> that are now supporting the project in terms of business development. In addition, the project has several researchers, psychiatrists and experts that aid the project with their expert knowledge in their fields.</p>

<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<div><h3><strong>How You Can Help &amp; What I Can Offer </strong></h3></div>
<div>
<p>To allow me to produce content for this exhibition, I am aiming to raise €6200 in funding. This amount would only go towards the material costs of creating the content (please see specification below). However much I raise during this crowdfunding campaign, I will do what I can with the funds raised and continue working on the project until I have enough content for an exhibition, hence the flexible funding target. So, every little helps and everything will go towards the exhibition.</p>
<p>If you, like I do, think this is important, I would be grateful if you could support this project either by spreading the word about this project, purchasing the merch or by making a donation.</p>
<p>You will receive the merchandise you purchase (see below) as well as updates on my project. You can also give yourself a pat on the back for helping me create art work that raises awareness about an important topic that people need to know about. </p>
<p> </p>

<br/><strong>About the Per os Project</strong>
</h3>
<p>For the past 3 years, as part of my artistic practice, I have been researching the connection between pharmaceutical companies and our society, healthcare and psychiatry, predominantly in the US, the UK and Sweden. As some of us already know, this is a big – and sometimes dirty – business that capitalizes on people's illnesses, where paramount importance is often given to making money rather than to patients’ health or actual recovery. <br/><br/>When I read and studied existing research and carried out my own activist surveys, what I found out made me furious! <strong>For the past 3 years, I myself have been able to be prescribed antidepressants over the phone without even speaking to a doctor.</strong> I have not taken these but instead I use them in the object above, an ongoing process much like saving coins.<br/><br/>The majority of the information I found out during this work had me asking, <strong>""do people know about this?!""</strong> It also got me thinking <strong>“if they don’t know about it, they really need to know!”</strong>. People need to hear and see what is rarely talked about or made public. This is why<strong> all works in the exhibition will make direct reference to research articles, allowing the visitor to</strong> <strong>do their own investigations</strong>. I urge you not to believe what I say but to do your own research.<strong> </strong><br/><br/><u><strong>The research has been conducted based on:</strong></u><br/>-Available research such as scientific articles, lectures and news articles<br/>-Correspondence with numerous researchers and experts in predominantly Sweden, the US and the UK that aid the project with their expert knowledge in their fields. <br/>-Activist surveys<br/>-Interviews<br/><br/>My aim is to make the art work and its research references as public as possible using different kinds of channels, methods and interventions. <br/><br/>Much of the actual art work is being created at <a href=""http://www.kkvmm.se/eng/kontakt.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Konstnärernas Kollektivverkstad Monumental</a>, a collective workshop/studio in Malmö (as seen in the trailer above). </p>
<p>""Big Pharma"" is impacting on us and our peers on a daily basis – whether we are aware of it or not – and as people we are the ones that can and will be able to change this injustice. Help me show people what is happening and give them choice in their lives again by highlighting this important topic and that a change of course is required.<br/><br/><u><i>For more information and references regarding the research articles please see the bottom of this page. I urge you to do your own surveys and research.</i></u></p>

</h3>
<p>To donate to this project, you can buy merchandise that has all been designed by me specifically for the project. The pill brooches (see photo below) are all individually handmade by me in lacquered ceramics and are available in a limited edition of four sets of 50 each. As they are handmade small variations in appearance may occur.<br/><br/>Iintend to ship the merch as quickly as possible. The pill brooches are already made and therefore can be sent fairly quickly. For merch purchases below €170 I will use standard shipping. For merch costing €170 and above I will use a trackable service.  <br/><br/><i>(<u>You can change the currency at the bottom of this page</u>)</i></p>

<h3><strong>The Impact</strong></h3>
<p>Your contribution will make a difference! You will help me raise awareness through the artwork I will produce and exhibit.</p>
<p>In the past I have successfully used crowdfunding through Kickstarter to fund the 'KAMI' art project that I worked on for 4 years. This was presented at the largest photo festival in Scandinavia – <a href=""https://www.landskronafoto.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Landskrona Foto</a> – in 2018 and is now on permanent display exhibited at one of the most important art museums in Sweden, <a href=""https://www.ystad.se/kultur/ystads-konstmuseum/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Ystad Konstmuseum</a>. </p>

<h3><strong>About </strong></h3>
<p>Markus Sjöborg runs a multidisciplinary art practice based in Malmö, Sweden. His practice focuses on self-initiated work as well as commissioned work. Recurring themes in the self-initiated work revolve around topics such as social issues, health, copyright issues and others. Media given precedence are graphics, artist’s books and objects in various materials which  become vehicles through which Markus approaches, researches and expresses these recurring themes in addition to using non-verbal and intuitive approaches as well. You can find some of the work on <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/markus.sjoborg/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Instagram</a>. </p>

<h3><strong>The survey</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Overview of the topics</strong></p>
<p>Below is a selection of the topics I've been looking into during my surveys - with an emphasis on the US, Sweden and the UK. Details of the actual scientific sources are shown further down on this page.</p>
<p>-The monoamine hypothesis - the hypothesis that depression is linked to a so called ""chemical imbalance"" and lack of serotonin (Schildkraut, 1965) -  and how this hypothesis was marketed and disseminated in the 1980s by PR campaigns and Pharmaceutical companies such as Lilly (then Eli Lilly) promoting their psychiatric drug, Prozac.</p>
<p>-The evaluation and testing of psychiatric drugs by national agencies and how these agencies are funded and operated (<a href=""https://www.fda.gov"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">FDA</a> in USA and its equivalent in Sweden; <a href=""https://lakemedelsverket.se"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Läkemedelsverket</a>).</p>
<p>-Pharmaceutical companies' lobbying power and the politics of their link to our society/governments/authorities as well as healthcare and psychiatry in the USA, the UK and Sweden.</p>
<p>- The discontinuation/withdrawal of psychiatric drugs – specifically anti-depressants – and what information and help is provided or not provided by pharmaceutical companies, healthcare and psychiatry about this and the disconnect with the patient/peer perspective, what is and what is not recognized.</p>
<p>-Statistics on and the increase in diagnoses such as ADHD and depression and the related increase in the prescription of psychiatric drugs.</p>
<p>-Research/statistics on the side effects of psychiatric drugs such as (but not limited to): and the link between their use and suicide as well as out-of-character violence such as homicide.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong><i>“The truth is that the chemical imbalance story of mental illness was always a kind of a urban myth. It was never a theory seriously propounded by well-informed psychiatrists.</i></strong></h3>

</div></div>","Overview
Per os is a research-based art project about the pharmaceutical companies' role in our society, psychiatry and healthcare. Using surveys I have conducted over the past three years and a large amount of anger at how wrong and corrupt the system is, I would like to interpret  this research artistically in order to develop material for an exhibition. The aim of this exhibition is to highlight the research content of the project and to raise awareness. In the exhibition there will be direct references to existing research, studies and articles as well as my own activist surveys over the past three years that you can read more about below.
I am currently in the process of fleshing out the project's contextual framework through studies at Uppsala University and I have just finished studies at Malmö University that are now supporting the project in terms of business development. In addition, the project has several researchers, psychiatrists and experts that aid the project with their expert knowledge in their fields.
 

 
 
How You Can Help & What I Can Offer 

To allow me to produce content for this exhibition, I am aiming to raise €6200 in funding. This amount would only go towards the material costs of creating the content (please see specification below). However much I raise during this crowdfunding campaign, I will do what I can with the funds raised and continue working on the project until I have enough content for an exhibition, hence the flexible funding target. So, every little helps and everything will go towards the exhibition.
If you, like I do, think this is important, I would be grateful if you could support this project either by spreading the word about this project, purchasing the merch or by making a donation.
You will receive the merchandise you purchase (see below) as well as updates on my project. You can also give yourself a pat on the back for helping me create art work that raises awareness about an important topic that people need to know about. 
 
The exhibition will include:-3 large-scale objects................€3500-1 light display.............................€1500-Graphics/posters.....................€1000-Indiegogo fees............................€200Total:........................................€6200

About the Per os Project

For the past 3 years, as part of my artistic practice, I have been researching the connection between pharmaceutical companies and our society, healthcare and psychiatry, predominantly in the US, the UK and Sweden. As some of us already know, this is a big – and sometimes dirty – business that capitalizes on people's illnesses, where paramount importance is often given to making money rather than to patients’ health or actual recovery. When I read and studied existing research and carried out my own activist surveys, what I found out made me furious! For the past 3 years, I myself have been able to be prescribed antidepressants over the phone without even speaking to a doctor. I have not taken these but instead I use them in the object above, an ongoing process much like saving coins.The majority of the information I found out during this work had me asking, ""do people know about this?!"" It also got me thinking “if they don’t know about it, they really need to know!”. People need to hear and see what is rarely talked about or made public. This is why all works in the exhibition will make direct reference to research articles, allowing the visitor to do their own investigations. I urge you not to believe what I say but to do your own research. The research has been conducted based on:-Available research such as scientific articles, lectures and news articles-Correspondence with numerous researchers and experts in predominantly Sweden, the US and the UK that aid the project with their expert knowledge in their fields. -Activist surveys-InterviewsMy aim is to make the art work and its research references as public as possible using different kinds of channels, methods and interventions. Much of the actual art work is being created at Konstnärernas Kollektivverkstad Monumental, a collective workshop/studio in Malmö (as seen in the trailer above). 
""Big Pharma"" is impacting on us and our peers on a daily basis – whether we are aware of it or not – and as people we are the ones that can and will be able to change this injustice. Help me show people what is happening and give them choice in their lives again by highlighting this important topic and that a change of course is required.For more information and references regarding the research articles please see the bottom of this page. I urge you to do your own surveys and research.
 
 

The Merch

To donate to this project, you can buy merchandise that has all been designed by me specifically for the project. The pill brooches (see photo below) are all individually handmade by me in lacquered ceramics and are available in a limited edition of four sets of 50 each. As they are handmade small variations in appearance may occur.Iintend to ship the merch as quickly as possible. The pill brooches are already made and therefore can be sent fairly quickly. For merch purchases below €170 I will use standard shipping. For merch costing €170 and above I will use a trackable service.  (You can change the currency at the bottom of this page)
 

 

Other Ways You Can Help

If you like me, think this is an important message and the public needs to know about it, I'd be very happy and grateful if you could spread the word about the project e.g. by using the Indiegogo tools on this site. You can also contribute by making a donation at the top of the page by clicking ""Back it"".
 
 

The Impact
Your contribution will make a difference! You will help me raise awareness through the artwork I will produce and exhibit.
In the past I have successfully used crowdfunding through Kickstarter to fund the 'KAMI' art project that I worked on for 4 years. This was presented at the largest photo festival in Scandinavia – Landskrona Foto – in 2018 and is now on permanent display exhibited at one of the most important art museums in Sweden, Ystad Konstmuseum. 
 


“It is simply no longer possible to believe much of the clinical research that is published, or to rely on the judgment of trusted physicians or authoritative medical guidelines. I take no pleasure in this conclusion, which I reached slowly and reluctantly over my two decades as an editor.

About 
Markus Sjöborg runs a multidisciplinary art practice based in Malmö, Sweden. His practice focuses on self-initiated work as well as commissioned work. Recurring themes in the self-initiated work revolve around topics such as social issues, health, copyright issues and others. Media given precedence are graphics, artist’s books and objects in various materials which  become vehicles through which Markus approaches, researches and expresses these recurring themes in addition to using non-verbal and intuitive approaches as well. You can find some of the work on Instagram. 
 

 
The survey
Overview of the topics
Below is a selection of the topics I've been looking into during my surveys - with an emphasis on the US, Sweden and the UK. Details of the actual scientific sources are shown further down on this page.
-The monoamine hypothesis - the hypothesis that depression is linked to a so called ""chemical imbalance"" and lack of serotonin (Schildkraut, 1965) -  and how this hypothesis was marketed and disseminated in the 1980s by PR campaigns and Pharmaceutical companies such as Lilly (then Eli Lilly) promoting their psychiatric drug, Prozac.
-The evaluation and testing of psychiatric drugs by national agencies and how these agencies are funded and operated (FDA in USA and its equivalent in Sweden; Läkemedelsverket).
-Pharmaceutical companies' lobbying power and the politics of their link to our society/governments/authorities as well as healthcare and psychiatry in the USA, the UK and Sweden.
- The discontinuation/withdrawal of psychiatric drugs – specifically anti-depressants – and what information and help is provided or not provided by pharmaceutical companies, healthcare and psychiatry about this and the disconnect with the patient/peer perspective, what is and what is not recognized.
-Statistics on and the increase in diagnoses such as ADHD and depression and the related increase in the prescription of psychiatric drugs.
-Research/statistics on the side effects of psychiatric drugs such as (but not limited to): and the link between their use and suicide as well as out-of-character violence such as homicide.
 
“The truth is that the chemical imbalance story of mental illness was always a kind of a urban myth. It was never a theory seriously propounded by well-informed psychiatrists.

<h3> </h3>
<p>Hello my fine friends! I'm Izzy, creatrix of the Heroine's Journey Oracle! I'm so excited to share this deck with you, and so grateful for your help to bring her into the world. </p>
<p>Oracles thread through what I think of as my feral fairy girlhood growing up in Guerneville California; from dreaming in the crevice of a redwood, listening to the current of the Russian River, reading patterns in snail trails, and playing with my imaginary friend Foxy in the clover.</p>
<p>The Heroine’s Journey cards both draw from and take me to these kinds of secret places, into hidden terrain. The cards are from a deep well inside, a well found in the quiet fall forest, in the misty in between time.</p>
<p>For me, they're a natural, mystical way through the dark sparkling waters of the forgotten and the unhealed in the quest for wholeness. </p>
<p>Join me on the journey!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The Heroine’s Journey Oracle is a 45 card deck, created to guide you on your journey. The cards serve as a mirror, companion and guide for healing and self-discovery. </p>
<p>This deck can be used with only the guidebook. Excerpts from my fable ""Kamaal's Journey"" these cards originate from accompany each interpretation in the guidebook, and the cards channel recognizable archetypal imagery drawn from the collective unconscious. </p>
<p>They are stunningly beautiful, with original art by my dear friends Tayah Blanck, David Tenorio, and Nahkoura Mahnassi that just blow my mind. Both the deck and the book are beautifully designed. The cards are perfection, illustrated with meticulous attention to my story and design for them.  I’m so over the moon happy with each of them!</p>
<p>The Heroine’s Journey cards provide deeper understanding and analysis of ourselves and the universe around us. Through divination, we engage the forces of synchronicity, sacred wisdom, ritual, and symbol to understand the universal and personal archetypes reflecting our place on our path, and what we're living at the time of drawing the cards.</p>
<p>The Heroine's/my/our story has shown me how to help myself and others on this path.</p>
<h3> </h3>
<p>This project was created from my heart, from my tenderness to describe the dark path of abuse, loss, addiction, assault, and mental illness, and to guide me in my own Journey, for the integration of the unhealed, hidden parts of myself.</p>
<p>Kamaal’s story is woven from dreams, real-life experiences, fantasies and visualizations. I have found her Journey within myself, my friends, and the amazing folx I’ve been blessed to work in my psychotherapy practice.

<p>The material in the Heroine’s Journey describes the path we traverse to find restoration or what is at its root unbroken.

<p>My deepest wishes are twofold:</p>
<p>That this project will help folx feel accompanied as they walk their road. I want the Heroine’s Journey cards to help users find the psychic power and health they seek. I want them to increase choicefulness and to help self-compassion become integrated, reflexive, and instinctual.</p>
<p>Eventually, I'd like to use the cards to lead retreats, and to workshop in psychotherapeutic group settings, using the cards, guidebook and full story to work with unconscious material and find ourselves in the Heroine’s Journey.<br/> </p>
<p>My campaign goal is to make available the high quality decks in custom tuckboxes, with beautifully constructed guidebooks.</p>
<p>If you need any help with using this platform, I'm here for you so please just let me know. I believe I can do it for you from the back end--I know it's complicated and confusing to many--It is to me too!! </p>

</div><div><h3> </h3></div></div>","Hello my fine friends! I'm Izzy, creatrix of the Heroine's Journey Oracle! I'm so excited to share this deck with you, and so grateful for your help to bring her into the world. 
Oracles thread through what I think of as my feral fairy girlhood growing up in Guerneville California; from dreaming in the crevice of a redwood, listening to the current of the Russian River, reading patterns in snail trails, and playing with my imaginary friend Foxy in the clover.
The Heroine’s Journey cards both draw from and take me to these kinds of secret places, into hidden terrain. The cards are from a deep well inside, a well found in the quiet fall forest, in the misty in between time.
For me, they're a natural, mystical way through the dark sparkling waters of the forgotten and the unhealed in the quest for wholeness. 
Join me on the journey!
 
The Heroine’s Journey Oracle is a 45 card deck, created to guide you on your journey. The cards serve as a mirror, companion and guide for healing and self-discovery. 
This deck can be used with only the guidebook. Excerpts from my fable ""Kamaal's Journey"" these cards originate from accompany each interpretation in the guidebook, and the cards channel recognizable archetypal imagery drawn from the collective unconscious. 
They are stunningly beautiful, with original art by my dear friends Tayah Blanck, David Tenorio, and Nahkoura Mahnassi that just blow my mind. Both the deck and the book are beautifully designed. The cards are perfection, illustrated with meticulous attention to my story and design for them.  I’m so over the moon happy with each of them!
The Heroine’s Journey cards provide deeper understanding and analysis of ourselves and the universe around us. Through divination, we engage the forces of synchronicity, sacred wisdom, ritual, and symbol to understand the universal and personal archetypes reflecting our place on our path, and what we're living at the time of drawing the cards.
The Heroine's/my/our story has shown me how to help myself and others on this path.
 
This project was created from my heart, from my tenderness to describe the dark path of abuse, loss, addiction, assault, and mental illness, and to guide me in my own Journey, for the integration of the unhealed, hidden parts of myself.
Kamaal’s story is woven from dreams, real-life experiences, fantasies and visualizations. I have found her Journey within myself, my friends, and the amazing folx I’ve been blessed to work in my psychotherapy practice. It is with immense gratitude that I offer you the culmination of this tapestry in the form of this Oracle deck, in the hopes that it serves others.
The material in the Heroine’s Journey describes the path we traverse to find restoration or what is at its root unbroken. Traveling through the darkness, with awareness, we find clarity and compassion that helps us to integrate shadow parts of ourselves that need to be freed, or loved, or heard in order that we may transform.
My deepest wishes are twofold:
That this project will help folx feel accompanied as they walk their road. I want the Heroine’s Journey cards to help users find the psychic power and health they seek. I want them to increase choicefulness and to help self-compassion become integrated, reflexive, and instinctual.
Eventually, I'd like to use the cards to lead retreats, and to workshop in psychotherapeutic group settings, using the cards, guidebook and full story to work with unconscious material and find ourselves in the Heroine’s Journey. 
My campaign goal is to make available the high quality decks in custom tuckboxes, with beautifully constructed guidebooks.
If you need any help with using this platform, I'm here for you so please just let me know. I believe I can do it for you from the back end--I know it's complicated and confusing to many--It is to me too!!

<p> I'm Juan Pablo Eng Goon, I'm from Guadalajara, Jalisco, México, I'm 18 years old and I want to change the world. I know it sounds a little bit crazy, but let me explain you. Last year I finished High School, and the actual society says that you need to choose some career, so I was there, choosing something that I didn't want to choose, so I did paperwork to the international business career, but at the end I didn't do the exam, cause I realize that it wasn't my passion. I don't think do something that I don't want to do, so I thought: What would make me happy? So I imagined me, traveling; meeting new places, new culture, maybe new language, but the most important: new people. Everybody has a story to tell, so with letters and photographs I want to be a storyteller. </p>
<p></p>

<p>So this is the plan: take an airplane to cross the atlantic ocean, doesn't matter to much the destiny, the most important is the people that you are about to meet. So start living, don't have a plan cause I think that the best things in life are the ones that we don't plan. At the end of the day write a letter about that day and send it to unknown people. </p>
<p><b><i>But why handwritten letters?</i></b> </p>
<p>Probably you think that is unnecessary, cause we live in a technology era, where we can send a message instantly with all the social networks that actually exist, but I believe in the magic of handwritten letters cause when you write them, you put a part of your soul on it. There is something beautiful in the imperfection of your letter, in the time where you have to wait, because in that time you learn to appreciate. We live in a world where everything is so fast, but sometimes you need to slow down, and contemplate, learn to value. </p>

development of movies, the influence of drama becomes more and more

drama is an urge question which keeps bothering us. At last, our team 
members reach an agreement and we decide develop drama experience studio
 aiming to  let participants involve in drama physically and

drama, learn theatrical knowledge and combine the experiential learning

<p>My name is Chantal King. I am a local artist of the Mississippi Gulf Coast. I moved to Mississippi when I was five and have ...been a resident of the MS Gulf Coast ever since. ""This is home.""<br/><br/> Ever since I was little girl, I always had an interest for art, music, animals, and marine life. My first interest was Marine Biology until I took my first art studio class at MGCCC from then on I knew I wanted a career being an artist. I graduated with cum laude from WCU earning a B.F.A. in Ceramics. <br/><br/> I received fist place and best in show at the Senior Art Exhibition in 2008. <br/><br/> Artist Statement: <br/> I have always been a passionate expressive person. My love for music and marine biology are most often my subject matter for my paintings. As for my pottery, I enjoy the fulfillment and connection I get from working with clay. The ocean is full of life that is mysterious, wondrous, and exciting to me. I am very expressive with texture and find it very pleasing to the eye to embody such textures, shapes, and colors found in marine animals and plants. I believe that it is these three things that give my work a sense of movement and life of its own. <br/><br/> May My Southern Art Bring You Warmth in Every Season! </p>
<p>Please help me raise money for much needed pottery equipment. My goal is to have a studio of my own, so I don't have to take it somewhere for making and firing pottery. The money will help me to purchase: a pottery wheel, kiln, slab roller, and possible materials like: bats, kiln shelves, stilts, glazes, and clay. Owning my own studio will help me to bring costs down and help me to produce pottery in a timely manner that is acceptable as a business, and the possibility of having pottery classes! </p> <p><br/></p>
</div></div>","My name is Chantal King. I am a local artist of the Mississippi Gulf Coast. I moved to Mississippi when I was five and have ...been a resident of the MS Gulf Coast ever since. ""This is home."" Ever since I was little girl, I always had an interest for art, music, animals, and marine life. My first interest was Marine Biology until I took my first art studio class at MGCCC from then on I knew I wanted a career being an artist. I graduated with cum laude from WCU earning a B.F.A. in Ceramics.  I received fist place and best in show at the Senior Art Exhibition in 2008.  Artist Statement:  I have always been a passionate expressive person. My love for music and marine biology are most often my subject matter for my paintings. As for my pottery, I enjoy the fulfillment and connection I get from working with clay. The ocean is full of life that is mysterious, wondrous, and exciting to me. I am very expressive with texture and find it very pleasing to the eye to embody such textures, shapes, and colors found in marine animals and plants. I believe that it is these three things that give my work a sense of movement and life of its own.  May My Southern Art Bring You Warmth in Every Season!

<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">           Hi I'm Jenna Anderson and thank you so much for your interest in my project.  I've been dreaming of making this idea a reality for a while now and I'm so excited to finally jump in! For nine years I've been focusing on commissions and teaching to support myself, family and business while working at becoming a better painter. I feel blessed to be able to be an artist and I've just learned so much over the years through working on commissions and teaching- that it's been the most enjoyable time of my life.  With that being said, I also feel I haven't had the invaluable time needed to be able to focus fully on evolving my own visions/feelings in my work and I'm ready now more than ever.  I’ve invested in myself, applied to grants and I'm always looking for opportunities that may help me achieve this goal-they have lead me here.  So, I'm ready to let go of the reins and stop looking at other art, quiet the voices of the outside world and truly tap into my own.  This break from these distractions will allow me the opportunity to build a powerful body of work that I can pour myself into fully, heart and soul.  Work that I can carry into the future, pursuing gallery representation, having solo exhibitions and other opportunities that will open many more doors to explore.  </span><br/></p>

this project. </span><br/></p>
<p>To create the new paintings there are some supplies I will
need.  They have come out to $4650.  They are as follows: <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Paint, Substrates, stretcher bars, studio and application tools, brushes, updated lighting, mediums, varnish and frames.</span></p>
<p>Other Expenses have come out to $4350: Studio/gallery yearly rent (I've had a public gallery space at LibertyTown Arts in Fredericksburg Va since 2009 that I LOVE and cannot afford to stay, and am trying to keep it for another year-as it's been very helpful exposure), Living expenses, New Website yearly fee, shipping costs of my work to different galleries in the USA, and Perk
fulfillment. </p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<div>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">               This campaign is just the beginning of the path I wish to be on, moving forward towards my goals.  My overall goal as a painter is to paint what I love.  And, I've been working hard for nine years now during which I've been eagerly gathering the reference material for these ""love"" paintings, and they've been patiently waiting for me to bring them to life.  I think..Honestly,their patience is running low... but that's a whole other story.  But, my point being, I've wanted nothing more in my life than the chance to paint them and it's Time.  At the end of this journey of a year I will hold a Solo Exhibition, unveiling this new library of paintings all together as a series.  The difference you will be making in my life will be more profound than I can possibly express, both mentally and spiritually.   With your help I can grow and evolve as an artist, building upon the foundation I’ve started- towards something even more amazing and authentically me.  And, I'll be able to keep my studio/gallery space that I love at LibertyTown Arts which will help me even further and keep me going strong on my journey! Now is your opportunity to give a little bit that will help me for a lifetime.   </span><br/>
</div>
<div>
<p></p>
</div>
<p>I hope to share with you this new work and new energy it brings out.  I’ve never had a campaign or done anything like this, but I don't give up and would love the chance to prove myself to you.  Because, I’m obsessed with creating art, with painting and if I don’t get this chance I may go a little crazy.  And, <span style=""background-color: initial;"">I'm looking forward to sharing this journey with you as I keep you updated on my progress throughout the year. </span></p>

</div></div>","My Story
           Hi I'm Jenna Anderson and thank you so much for your interest in my project.  I've been dreaming of making this idea a reality for a while now and I'm so excited to finally jump in! For nine years I've been focusing on commissions and teaching to support myself, family and business while working at becoming a better painter. I feel blessed to be able to be an artist and I've just learned so much over the years through working on commissions and teaching- that it's been the most enjoyable time of my life.  With that being said, I also feel I haven't had the invaluable time needed to be able to focus fully on evolving my own visions/feelings in my work and I'm ready now more than ever.  I’ve invested in myself, applied to grants and I'm always looking for opportunities that may help me achieve this goal-they have lead me here.  So, I'm ready to let go of the reins and stop looking at other art, quiet the voices of the outside world and truly tap into my own.  This break from these distractions will allow me the opportunity to build a powerful body of work that I can pour myself into fully, heart and soul.  Work that I can carry into the future, pursuing gallery representation, having solo exhibitions and other opportunities that will open many more doors to explore.  


The Funds & Perks

 

I’ll need 9,000 to cover and complete
this project. 
To create the new paintings there are some supplies I will
need.  They have come out to $4650.  They are as follows: Paint, Substrates, stretcher bars, studio and application tools, brushes, updated lighting, mediums, varnish and frames.
Other Expenses have come out to $4350: Studio/gallery yearly rent (I've had a public gallery space at LibertyTown Arts in Fredericksburg Va since 2009 that I LOVE and cannot afford to stay, and am trying to keep it for another year-as it's been very helpful exposure), Living expenses, New Website yearly fee, shipping costs of my work to different galleries in the USA, and Perk
fulfillment. 
Here is the link to LibertyTown Arts!: http://www.libertytownarts.com/site/
And, here is me in my studio/gallery space through out the years there!: 





So...Perks! The fun part! 
I'm so excited about sharing these with you. I'm offering original charcoal drawings and oil paintings for lower prices, email critiques, wildcards, VIP invitations to see the Solo Show work first, art discounts and other surprises.   I'm also putting together some rad handwritten thank you cards because I appreciate you all so much.  
Below are photos of the pieces you are purchasing when you make a donation. They are listed in order to match up with the perks on the main page.  For more details or questions, feel free to message me here: jennaanderson2016@gmail.com  (Scroll down to the bottom of the story to view the images)


The Impact

               This campaign is just the beginning of the path I wish to be on, moving forward towards my goals.  My overall goal as a painter is to paint what I love.  And, I've been working hard for nine years now during which I've been eagerly gathering the reference material for these ""love"" paintings, and they've been patiently waiting for me to bring them to life.  I think..Honestly,their patience is running low... but that's a whole other story.  But, my point being, I've wanted nothing more in my life than the chance to paint them and it's Time.  At the end of this journey of a year I will hold a Solo Exhibition, unveiling this new library of paintings all together as a series.  The difference you will be making in my life will be more profound than I can possibly express, both mentally and spiritually.   With your help I can grow and evolve as an artist, building upon the foundation I’ve started- towards something even more amazing and authentically me.  And, I'll be able to keep my studio/gallery space that I love at LibertyTown Arts which will help me even further and keep me going strong on my journey! Now is your opportunity to give a little bit that will help me for a lifetime.   




I hope to share with you this new work and new energy it brings out.  I’ve never had a campaign or done anything like this, but I don't give up and would love the chance to prove myself to you.  Because, I’m obsessed with creating art, with painting and if I don’t get this chance I may go a little crazy.  And, I'm looking forward to sharing this journey with you as I keep you updated on my progress throughout the year. 


Other Ways You Can Help

If you can't contribute there is another way you can help!:

I have a background in film, crafts, graphic design, and I have done everything from digital painting to pottery to re-furbishing an antique chair. My passion is creating worlds. Let me help you bring yours to life with as many action figures as you want. </p>
<p>This project started with the toy you see on the left. I have been very busy working on this project so she is not complete, but she started it all. Sailor Moon was a passion of mine as a child, and Saturn is a character who was never made in this line of toys, which I love. I somehow ended up with some ""extra"" toys of other characters and since the body parts on the toys are interchangeable: Saturn was born! (The box was made by me, as was Jack's box. I bought the toys, Saturn was a re-paint, and Jack was custom ordered from the only other people who make things similar to Toys like Saturn.) </p>
<p>On the Right side is Jack, one of my original characters, from a screenplay I am currently finishing up called Blood. I found a service that made him, and I really thought it was awesome when I found out I could have him made for me in this style! Wow! </p>
<p><span class="""" style=""line-height: 30px;""><b>What I Need, and What You'll Get</b></span></p>
</div><div> <p>What I would like from you, please: I have gotten to the stage where I own and have learned to use a 3D printer to make 3D printed objects, but now what I really need is to get the right kind of Filament, and so that I can make every toy perfect. Filament is expensive and I am working hard to find the perfect material in which to fabricate your toys, as I have yet to find it. This is where you can help the most. I may at some point need to make my own filament, and the price on filament makers is dropping, but is still expensive. Also new types of filaments are becoming available all the time. However, the price of filament is not dropping. To buy one spool of filament I have to sell 2 toys. The toys are small, so I am hoping the filament price will remain at it's current level and that I can buy what I need for not too great of a front-end investment, but I still really need your help buying materials.  </p>
<p>What you will get in return: Awesome Toys of course! But for those who pre-order and help make these a reality I am also going to offer inexpensive model drawings of your characters, a discount heal-your-mesh for 3D printing service, and limited edition toys of very few Anime characters. Pre-Order those Limited Editions now, I am only offering 20 of them. After that they will go exclusively to Etsy and will be much more expensive.  </p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>I want to help encourage all people, but especially children, to engage in real play and to expand their imaginations. I want to get them off of the video games for a little while and get them creating. I believe imaginative play as a child is one of the most important aspects of growing up to be a well rounded and thoughtful adult. Also sitting around all day and staring at computer and television screens can lead to serious health problems.</p>
<p>I think we deserve to give our children a chance to expand their play beyond the oridinary and give them real tools to spread their stories out into the world and I think that giving them toys of their own creation will help them in all aspects of their growth. I remember spending hours playing with my toys and creating stories of my own. I have been very sad to see actual children come into the Microsoft Store... I started hanging out there to check out a 3D printer they had, and made good friends with the staff... so I go there every week and kids come in and I'll ask them what they like to read or play with and none of them have even heard or have any interest in what I loved, and still love as an adult. More than one has actually said they have no interest in fantasy at all. It makes me actively sad.    </p>
<p>I think adults can benefit from this project as well. Use these toys as a tool to promote your special ideas, give an awesome gift. Surprise your friends with a toy of them, or of you!</p>
<p>Get on the floor with your kids, and play with them! Use your imagination, and see yourself come to life as a super hero, a magician, a princess, a pirate, or whatever you want to be. Help give me get the tools to make you or someone you love something totally awesome by Christmas time, or sooner!</p>
<p>My secondary goal is to help save Wildlife. So for every toy you buy I will donate $2 to this campaign: <a href=""https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/air-shepherd-drones-stop-elephant-rhino-poaching/x/9089092"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/air-shepherd...</a>. </p>
<p>I believe in helping our world, not just human children, but if I raise more money than I need from this campaign it will go directly to funding the WWF. I truly believe in their mission, and I hope you do as well. Biodiversity is one of the most important things we can leave for our children, but we must act quickly before species like Elephants, Rhinos, and Big Cats, disappear forever.  </p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>So far my greatest challenges have been getting the right products for my project, and learning to use them properly. What you will help me to do is to get the right filament I need for these toys, as they require a special type of plastic I hope to re-create as accurately as possible so that your toys will not only be beautiful, but will be almost unbreakable.  </p>

We are here seeking funds to scan the larger more expensive images like 'Go With The Flow' which is the size of a small person and costs 240 dollars to scan.

<b>Travis Seibolt                                    Alexander Williamson</b><br/><br/>
<p>Alexander Williamson is currently earning money working as an artist and
 has a proven record of selling his artwork.  He also works at Trader 
Joe's to supplement his income.  People just like Alex find themselves 
on the brink of earning a good living by just doing art. Our dream is to
 help artists grow and get over that tipping point.<br/></p>
<p> Travis is an incredibly talented artist who most recently worked at a car dealership here in Boise, Idaho. He is no longer with the dealership and we want to save him (and hopefully others) from unemployment and dead end jobs. <br/></p>
<p>These two like a ton of other artists out there would rather focus on the art than the business.  That is where I come in. Things I draw or paint are barely recognizable, I do however have an entrepreneurial drive and the education to back it up.</p>
<p> I'm a graduate from Boise State University's Entrepreneurship program and I'm dying to finally fulfill the need for entrepreneurship that I've been experiencing since I was young. I, just like many people, worked at low paying jobs through school and wasn't able to take an internship. I've found through my job hunting after graduation, that great jobs with great companies are really difficult to come by these days. That led me to believing launching my own business was the best way to go. Not only can I help myself get a job, I can help very talented artists as well.  I'm currently working as a phone banker which doesn't suit my entrepreneurial mind very well. I noticed that many artists will never realize what they could really accomplish with their artwork. I want to help artists that we see having a lot of promise to become better known and actually get paid for doing what they love to do.  <br/></p>
<p>We help our artists by paying them a much higher royalty then ordinary businesses pay. With the success of this campaign we can turn our idea into a business that can save myself and others from jobs that sap out our desire to do art and bring inspiring beautiful things to the world. That is why we call ourselves Save an Artist. In my wildest dreams about this idea I see myself meeting passionate 
artists and being able to make their dream career a reality.<br/></p>For more info on Carter Weyrauch or either of our artists and to see other works not featured here visit <a href=""http://www,saveanartist.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">our official website.  </a>Althought at the moment perks will be cheaper to get then paintings on our website <a href=""http://www,saveanartist.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.saveanartist.com</a><br/> <br/><br/>

<h3>Our Goal</h3>Our
goal of $2500 is enough for us to fulfill all of our perks, enough to help grow the business after our campaign (like attending art fairs), and get our high quality scans for each image 
listed in our perks. The more we can raise the more pieces of artwork we
 will be able to scan and have available in our online store very soon 
after the campaign ends!<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src="""" src="""" style=""""/></p>

business people. Its been a dream of mine to start a business since I 
was young and learning what I've learned about the economy, now more

<h3>Our Biggest Challenges</h3>
<br/><b>We are new</b><br/><ol>
<li>We are new to the world of internet and social media marketing. This makes it difficult to attract support<br/>
</li>
<li>This is our first business so odds are there will be unknowns that we will have to tackle. <br/>

</ol>
<b></b>
</div> <div> <h3>Our Solutions</h3>
<ol>
<li>
We have learned a ton! This is our second try at crowdfunding after a failed experience with Kickstarter. We learned a lot about the demographics between Indiegogo and Kickstarter and Indiegogo fits our demographics much better then Kickstarter did. We are also prepared to outsource things like PR needs since this is not our area of expertise.</li>
<li>
We have found the perfect business to work with to create our prints.  With decades of experience, Canvas Fine Arts (formerly Perfection Image Studio) and the wonderful people there are kind enough to help us as we learn the ropes. <br/>
</li>
<li>We are not going to let just any artists in. We look for potential to grow an artist and create their own brand. Our quality will be one strength we maintain to help our artists gain the attention they deserve. We will only take on artists that meet a very high standard so that people know when that when they come to our site they will only see the best work of the best artists we can find.<br/>
</li>
<li>Choosing the right partners means we can focus on setting up a network that will let us sell and distribute artwork for Travis and many other artists to come.<br/>
</li>
<li>
We politely request your help! Please help us out by using Indiegogo's awesome sharing tools. Use your very own organic sharing tool (your mouth) to tell people about our campaign. <b>OR! best of all, donate to help us out!</b><br/>
</li>
</ol>
<br/>While we are somewhat new at this business. I am proud to say that I 
have crunched all the numbers, I know exactly how much it will take scan, produce, and ship perks to our goal and well beyond it. We have the connections established already and this project is ready to launch and deliver some awesome artwork to you!<br/><br/>My 
entire college education was centered around learning what it takes to 
start up and build a successful business.  I absolutely love all the 
work I have done here and fully believe in what we are doing. It's always 
been a dream of mine to start a business. In school we are taught to examine what our network gives us and to work with that. When I looked at what was 
in my network I saw a LOT of very talented artists. Since I realized this, I've
 been reading up on everything I can get my hands on to learn about creating and selling artwork and building a business. I'm a highly adaptable person eager to drink up all the knowledge the internet and the world have to give.  Basically what I'm saying is that even with the challenges, I am excited and ready to deliver on this campaign and I'm confident you can find something you like in our artwork. <br/><br/><h3>Pictures of perks are available in the image gallery <br/>

<p><b>All of these image except for: Kill Me Alive, Taming Medusa's Mane, Inner Peace, Heart and Soul, have all been taken by a camera on a phone.  They are not the high quality images that will be printed for your perks!  Kill Me Alive is the test scan that I did to make sure I had found the right partner, so that one is showing the quality of image we will produce (Quality was slightly lowered in online pictures for copyright security)</b></p>
<p><b>Kill Me Alive, Taming Medusa's Mane, Inner Peace, Heart and Soul are examples of the super high quality scans we do to produce your perks.</b><br/>
</p>
<p>The quality of our re-creations is of utmost importance to us.  We will not be producing products with images that been with taken with a phone camera and printed 
out at home. Our Giclee prints are museum quality reproductions. Our 
scan and print shop uses an Epson 9900 printer with the industry's 
top-of-the-line UltraChrome K3 archival ink to re-create our artwork 
with cool coloration, superb saturation, and archival preservation for 
up to 200 years. The scanner used to get our images is top of the line 
and images are touched up to get rid of any marks or ripples from the 
original canvas. This quality means you and your family can continue to enjoy the artwork for generations.<br/></p>

</div></div>","Showcase of Perks.  Don't leave until you've seen our page gallery for pictures of all perks. All our prints are limited edition, signed and numbered by the artists, and come with a certificate of authenticity. They come on Giclee Canvas printed and scanned on top of the line equipment then coated with a special coating which is baked on by UV light making your artwork water and scratch resistantWe are selling our artwork at well below market value. The reason for this is to thank our backers who are willing to support our venture early on.  The 9""x12"" Giclee Prints up for $35 often retail for $60 or more. The 16""x20"" Inner peace would usually go for upwards around $120. This is a steal, especially considering our prices will go up after the Indiegogo fundraising. That way you know that your artwork will be appreciating in value. Again, thank you backers for everything!We are looking for funding to widen our selection of prints that we can provide. We are also trying to raise money to attend a handful of the artshows that happen here in Boise. Things like the Hyde Park Street fair, Boise Art in the Park and even some of the Saturday markets around town. Please help us out.  Below is a chart of all our perks for you to choose from. We hope you enjoy them and want to contribute to help us toward success!The Big Picture
We are a small partnership from Boise, Idaho. We call ourselves Save an Artist. The name comes from our mission in business. Our big picture goal is to create jobs for talented but lesser known artists and to help them gain attention and grow their name in the art community. We want to eventually be able to pay our artists enough to live on and more if their work takes off.
Your funding will get the ball rolling on our business. Once these two artists have some of their work selling we will use all the money we get to reinvest in more talented artists and create jobs. Your funding is key in helping us to creating more jobs for our economyThe Small Picture 

Currently we have scanned many of the smaller paintings. We are here seeking funds to scan the larger more expensive images like 'Go With The Flow' which is the size of a small person and costs 240 dollars to scan. If we can get 2500 dollars it will allow us to scan many of Travis' large/multi-canvas paintings like this one which has 4 separate canvases each one 18"" x 24"" ($80 each x 4 paintings= $240)


The other major goal we have for our campaign is to fund our attendance to the Hyde Park Street Fair. Its a local arts fair in Boise that would be an Ideal venue to showcase our prints and get our business' name out there. There are tons of festivals and art fairs like that out there and with additional funding we could attend even more.

I am a self-taught watercolor artist, working primarily on Yupo paper which is what gives my work its unique organic texture. I work out of my home studio with the assistance of copious amounts of coffee, loud music and Netflix. You may have seen my work on ThePioneerWoman.com, Dooce.com, MarthaStewart.com, TheBloggess.com, Neil Gaiman's twitter feed, or at the 2010 MTV Movie Award celebrity gift lounge.I live in Salem, Oregon.",4.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h4>
<b>And How You Can Help</b> </h4>The next step at 31Creators Ink is to equip these kids with proper technology and skills like using graphic tablets to draw, training them on the use of computers and graphics software. We also need to continuously engage these kids and build further the entrepreneurial and design ability in these kids. The goal is to make 31Creators Ink sustainable by placing adequate infrastructure for these kids so that they can continuously engage and build further the entrepreneurial and design abilities in themselves independently.<br/>As such, you can help in following ways:<br/><ul>
<li>
<strike>Give</strike> Invest in this kidpreneurial venture and feel proud to be an investor of a remarkable and unique startup at 31 Creators Ink</li>
<li>Order your business cards or logo design from 31Creators Ink and watch the magic of a child's imagination at work.<br/>
</li>
<li>Spread the word around and make some noise about this campaign.<br/>
</li>
</ul>All the money raised through the campaign will be utilised in the following manner:<br/><ul>
<li>Buying <b>5 desktop computers</b> ($2000), <b>1 All-in-one printer</b>($150), <b>5 graphics tablets</b> -($700) (like Wacom Tablets).</li>
<li>
<b>Renting a small space outside the school</b> where kids can work on their orders after school hours ($1200 per year).<br/>
</li>
</ul>
</div> <div> <h3>Impact</h3>
<h4>The Difference You Will Make </h4>
<p> You will be helping the kids <b>realize the power to dream beyond what is naturally given to them</b>. The entire project will ingrain in these kids a sense of self-belief, the power of purpose and the ability to contribute actively to the society. </p>
<p>The venture will also make the child and his community re-think their own limits and the power they have to overcome the obstacle they face in their lives.</p>
<h3>Risks and Challenges</h3>
<p></p>
<h4>Gauging The Mountains and Climbing Over It</h4>
<p>The biggest challenge is to break the mindset of a conventional education system that the school and the child's community has restricted itself to. It is also challenging to find time to undertake the venture in addition to building academic rigour in the kids.</p>
<p>Both these problems have been attempted to tackle in the following ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Integrating the school academics with the kidpreneurial project. For example : Teaching them ratios (in academics) and how rectangles with golden ratio between their dimensions look more attractive (in design) - can cover both the worlds.</li>
<li>Renting a separate space outside school premises where kids can drop-in any time after school to work on their orders.</li>
<li>Engaging volunteers with a shared vision of exploring the fountain of imagination in a kids' mind and training the kids in the use of computers and graphics software.<br/>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Bolanos Drum Co. is located in Glendale Heights, IL about 30 miles west from the great city of Chicago. Chicago is known as the birth ground for many of the famous and innovated drum companies in the world. For example: Ludwig, Slingerland, Camco, and Trick drums. Also, Chicago has one of the biggest drum store in the nation which is Vic's Drum Shop. Bolanos Drum Co is adding to that trend of innovation and integrity. How are we adding to that trend of innovation? The way that we are innovating is by using variety of woods to build drums. We use maple, birch, beach, mahogany, oak walnut and bubinga in our line up. Every drum that is build from different wood has a different tonality, resonance and character. Many companies use only maple and birch and maybe they use some other woods in there line up. That's why we are different from the majority of small drum companies and we stand out from the small custom drum builders. Other custom drum builders are able to build an amazing looking drums but the problem is that 70% to 80% of those custom drum builders are buying their shells only from the same manufacturer. So in reality there is not much difference in sound from drum builder to drum builder. We have partner with other drum shells manufacturer that are able to provide shells with our own specifications. No other drum company in the market has been able to provide drummers with so much variety of wood shells and shell sizes. We are putting our selfs in market where no one has gone before. We are covering as much of the sound spectrum as possible.</p>
<p>We want to rise $4,000 and with these funds we want to expand our brand to the Classic Series and Retrolite Series snare drum and later expand it full drum sets. Also, with these funds we be able to buy more machinery so that we can do more in - house work rather than outsourcing it and that way will help reduce cost of production and bring the price down for customers and that will lead to more competitive prices.</p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need </h3> <p>We want to rise $4,000 and with these funds we want to expand our brand to the Classic Series and Retrolite Series snare drum and later expand it full drum sets.

These three major magazines are distributed all over the world. Show casing our product on different drum shows, for example, the Chicago Drum Show in St. Charles IL and the NAMM Show in Anaheim California and many others. Also, going to different drum stores like Vic's Drum Shop, Chicago Music Exchange etc.. and present our products so they can have our product on sales floor. With these two execution along with the website (which is already running), it will help in two ways. First, it will increase sales. And second, we will get notice and recognized in the drum community as a drum company that does things bit different. The bottom line is to expose the brand as much as possible and tell customers why Bolanos Drum Co. is right choice and that we are here to help every drummer achieve their own sound by providing a variety of wood shells. Let customer understand that we are here to customize each drummer sound, expressions and style of playing and meet their individual needs.</p>

My name is Melaina
Todd, and I am an artist from Kamloops BC who was recently accepted
into a research residency Geophilia with Ayatana Artist
Research Program in Gatineau, Quebec. 


The goal of my
campaign is to raise money to cover travel and residency costs.

I will meet
specialists in Geology, explore
Laflèche
Caves, visit
the Museum of Nature's mineral collections, fire raku pottery, hang
out in Carleton University's microanalysis laboratory and collect
fossils to name a few activities. Then using all this knowledge, I
will be creating a new body of work combining geology and art.
By supporting my campaign, you are supporting my art career and education.
All contributors will receive a hand drawn, 1/1, pencil and ink drawing of your pet! Send me photos, ideas etc. and I will gladly make you a one of a kind drawing of your precious fur baby.
   What I Need & What You Get  The residency will cost $1500, and travel will cost at least $800. 

You get an original pencil and ink drawing of your pet! They come in three sizes, $50 for a small,$110 for a large and $220 for an X Large portrait.
The Impact

As an emerging
artist, it is vital for my practice to do residencies and learn
through cross-disciplinary programs like Art Ayatana Artist Research
Program.

I am being
challenged to make new work and sharing ideas with artists and
specialists.


I am exposed to a
greater audience of patrons, artists, educators and galleries.

I will have created a body of work of all the pet portraits that I have done!


Risks & Challenges


It will be
difficult to reach this deadline by May 7, 2015, which is in under
two months, so please share this campaign with your friends,
coworkers and families. 

Other Ways You Can Help

<p>Most Wanted Fine Art is a Pittsburgh
based community center disguised as an art gallery. Open since 2004, owners
Jason and Nina Sauer host 14 resident artists, provide job training for
individuals recently released from prison, and create yearly art cars. </p>
<p>MWFA has been invited to present the
Pittsburgh Art Car at the prestigious Downtown LA Artwalk and the Bay Area Maker Faire
in May. Since the car must be driven cross-country MWFA plans on taking seven artists total on the adventure.  </p>
<p>Most Wanted themed art piece grows
throughout the Art Car Tour and is towed behind a van throughout the trip as
mobile sculpture. The team takes mugshots of people in each city and wheat
pastes them directly on to the car as well as uploading the images to social
media. This allows the participant to be part of the trip and follow the
adventures. The artists  will be creating art live
and participating in artist talks and discussions in different cities along the
route. Once the car returns home it will move on to its next stage The Demolition Derby where it will be smashed over the Labor Day Weekend in the name of performance art.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Once a year since 1995, Jason Sauer has chosen
a car, painted it artistically, and then participated in an American folk art
performance of Demolition Derby at the Great Stoneboro Fair. This event sells
out each year with over 6,000 people in attendance. He doesn’t always win, but
cars always get smashed and sometimes the family comes home with a trophy.</p>
<p>The wrecked car will then be transformed one more time in the name of art. Jason Sauer will use a torch and cut out pieces of the car and create art out of the scraps. These limited pieces can be obtained by backers in their natural state or with the elevation of real Diamond Dust.</p>

In 2013 MWFA paid for the trip  and went to Philadelphia, Baltimore, and NYC for The World's Maker Faire. In 2014 MWFA paid for 5 artists to travel with the car and attended the World's Maker Faire. http://pittsburghartcar.com/2014-tour/

This year we need your help! This is the most artists we have ever traveled with and the farthest we have ever taken the car, plus as you know gas is very expensive.     Sometimes It's a Bumpy Road  With any long distance drive there are pot holes and wrong turns. We know there is a chance for a break down, flat tire, or other road side hazard that could delay us in our trip.   Jason Sauer grew up in a family of mechanics and has enough knowledge to fix most things. For the things he can't we have made contact with shops along the way so we have emergency plans for break downs.     Other Ways You Can Help Sometimes help is worth more than money:  We need you to share this campaign and help tell our story with your social media, email contacts, and face to face with friends.  We need places to stay in all the cities we visit! Do you or a friend have a nice comfy floor? These are the tentative cities and dates.

#SÉRIE12, c'est quoi ?

Acquérir une oeuvre et l'exposer chez soi est une façon d'exprimer sa personnalité. L'esthétique, le concept et les valeurs défendues par une création sont autant de façons de se révéler.
Les oeuvres urbaines installés par cssJPG sont éphémères, c'est pourquoi nous avons imaginé des Collections qui recensent annuellement les images documentants chaque fresque.
Avec la #SÉRIE12, nous souhaitons rendre ces Collections accessibles pour que chacun puisse facilement les emporter et les représenter dans son cercle intime.
#SÉRIE12 c'est :




Une sélection de 12 images par année issues des collections cssJPG

Un tirage de ces 12 images limité à 250 exemplaires. Chaque images sont titrées, numérotées, gaufrées et signées.
Toutes les images ont le même format (21cm x 30cm), pour une impression en quadrichromie sur un papier recyclé à fort grammage.

Chacune des images est une pièce de puzzle que le collectionneur peut combiner librement pour composer selon son humeur et son mur intérieur.
Le mode de tirage en grande série permet de multiplier le nombre de combinaisons possibles. Le collectionneur est invité à exprimer sa propre sensibilité, tant dans le choix des tirages, leur répétition ou encore l'ordre de leur présentation.

<p><b>Hidden Heroes</b></p>
<p>This coming November it will be two years since I was on a
hilltop in the north of Jordan saying goodbye to five Syrian engineers as they
returned home as part of a humanitarian assistance project trying to restore
basic services to communities ravaged by years of constant warfare. Each of
them was leaving behind the safe haven of a refugee camp to take up the cause
of helping those in more dire circumstances. As we stood on that cold hilltop

This coming November it will be two years since I was on a
hilltop in the north of Jordan saying goodbye to five Syrian engineers as they
returned home as part of a humanitarian assistance project trying to restore
basic services to communities ravaged by years of constant warfare. Each of
them was leaving behind the safe haven of a refugee camp to take up the cause
of helping those in more dire circumstances. As we stood on that cold hilltop
in the middle of the night I watched the horizon bloom with the light from
artillery attacks accompanied by an almost constant rumbling sound as rounds
impacted in civilian communities and military camps alike. I wondered if any of
these brave and caring men had ever imagined they would find themselves in this

<p>My name is Spencer Rogers. I am an abstract artist living in Chicago. I have spent many years making art that I love and developing a new concept of art that I call Modern Abstractions. (Will touch more on that later.) I went to art school in Florence, Italy and I have honed in my craft and ready to move it into the next stage.<br/></p> <p></p>
<p><b>What I Am Doing:</b></p>
I am launching this Indiegogo campaign to raise funds to set up the <b>S.Rog Gallery </b>—an independent art gallery.  I have a huge collection ready to show and the space to show it but in order to open my work space into a working gallery I need some extra help. My family has patiently waited for my last two series to be completed and my wife with a degree from Art Center College of Design is ready to help me get my work out there. We have had members from Columbia College and Art Institute of Chicago come and see the finished work and after hearing their advice to open this space into it's own art gallery we were sold. We put all we had into it and had one angel donor to get the walls and lighting done but we are still short.<p></p>

<br/><b></b>
</div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>I still  need to raise $20,000 to purchase the rest of the supplies, and materials needed to set up a fully functioning art gallery. The money will go towards permits, banner for front of building, work station for intern and office manager, phone/security, framing of some of the original pieces, and samples of Modern Abstractions printed and mounted.</p>
<p>If I do not reach the goal, I will work with what is raised, and fund 
the remaining needs as I go--after the gallery is up and running. I plan 
to have the gallery set up and ready to go by June of this year.<br/></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>What You Get:</b></p>

<p>The Modern Abstraction line: I combine my large format abstract painting with macro photography in order to create
 a series entitled ""Modern Abstractions"". The resulting images focus on 
some of the finest details found within the abstract paintings that are 
worth spotlighting, and will be available in a variety of sizes either on face mounted acrylic or printed on metal. Only 100 limited editions of each image will be sold.

</div></div>","Short Summary
My name is Spencer Rogers. I am an abstract artist living in Chicago. I have spent many years making art that I love and developing a new concept of art that I call Modern Abstractions. (Will touch more on that later.) I went to art school in Florence, Italy and I have honed in my craft and ready to move it into the next stage. 
What I Am Doing:
I am launching this Indiegogo campaign to raise funds to set up the S.Rog Gallery —an independent art gallery.  I have a huge collection ready to show and the space to show it but in order to open my work space into a working gallery I need some extra help. My family has patiently waited for my last two series to be completed and my wife with a degree from Art Center College of Design is ready to help me get my work out there. We have had members from Columbia College and Art Institute of Chicago come and see the finished work and after hearing their advice to open this space into it's own art gallery we were sold. We put all we had into it and had one angel donor to get the walls and lighting done but we are still short.


  What We Need & What You Get I still  need to raise $20,000 to purchase the rest of the supplies, and materials needed to set up a fully functioning art gallery. The money will go towards permits, banner for front of building, work station for intern and office manager, phone/security, framing of some of the original pieces, and samples of Modern Abstractions printed and mounted.
If I do not reach the goal, I will work with what is raised, and fund 
the remaining needs as I go--after the gallery is up and running. I plan 
to have the gallery set up and ready to go by June of this year.

What You Get:
Note cards with envelopes. Message card from Spencer


PRINTS! and ORIGINAL ART!You will have your choice of a selection of metallic prints or images printed on metal from my modern abstraction line.  




The Modern Abstraction line: I combine my large format abstract painting with macro photography in order to create
 a series entitled ""Modern Abstractions"". The resulting images focus on 
some of the finest details found within the abstract paintings that are 
worth spotlighting, and will be available in a variety of sizes either on face mounted acrylic or printed on metal. Only 100 limited editions of each image will be sold.



PLUS original paintings on wood!! 7 original oil on wood paintings, ranging in sizes 23x42-32x44  Here are the ones available now.










PLUS XL original paintings on wood!! We will sell 8 ranging in sizes 36x45-40x60  Here are the ones available.


















NEW JUST ADDED!  XL square original paintings: Oil on wood 48x48. Choose from 2 paintings. Will come framed and ready to hang.

JUST ADDED: We have FIVE 5x7 Oil on wood that will be framed in your choice of black or brown frame.  Each $600 , if you buy all 5 it's $2,000





We have FIVE 8x10 Oil on canvas that will be framed in your choice of black or brown frame.  Each $700 , if you buy all 5 it's $2,375

Other Ways You Can Help 
Of course, I realize that not everybody has a lot of disposable 
income in these tough economic times, but every contribution helps, even
 a small one.
And you can help out in other ways too.

<p><b>Intra Marmore </b>is an artistic project that aims to give soul to those
sculptures lost in time, trying to not just look at the surface, but discover what is hidden beneath.</p>
<p><b>“Inside the marble” is a
metaphor, a search for depth.</b></p>
<p>Because human beings, just as
those classical sculptures, often raise walls of defense to protect themselves,
walls of solid marble in order not to let people scratch our souls. Sometimes
we turn into beautiful statues and we bury our feelings where no one can find or
hurt them, beneath a cold and frozen exterior. We show ourselves as hard as
marble, strong as Michelangelo’s David, hiding our insecurities because we are
afraid that someone could take possession of our soul and steal it away. </p>
<p>That is the way I look at
those classical sculptures, as human beings trapped in a cold and static body,
immortals, with an empty stare that looks towards the horizon.  But if
it is true that the eyes are the mirror to the soul, then this is what I want
to give them: a soul, as if this mission was about myself, about each of us.</p>
<p>Intra Marmore is an artistic
project initially born as personal research to give a message to the people who
observe it. It is a hidden and encrypted message that only the people who can
actually observe can understand. We should always truly look at the world
around us, to see things that people
usually miss, beneath the skin and beyond prejudice and appearance.</p>

<p>I chose to examine five
classical statues; the collection will include five artworks painted in black
and white with details in color to show the marble transformation into a living
and organic material. I
will add to all the statue the eyes, and in some circumstances I will paint
with colors the contact points as well.</p>
<p>These are the works I chose to
examine: </p>
<p>1.
Apollo and Daphne (Bernini)</p>
<p>2.
The three Graces (Canova)</p>

Adonis and Venus (Canova)</p>
<p>4.
Cupid and Psyche (Canova) </p>
<p>5.
David (Michelangelo)</p>
<p>The second phase of the
project consists of the creation of paper sketches; which permits a far more detailed study. The sketches were realised in black
and white, with details in colour as to create a guide line to realise afterwardsthe entire series painted on oil. (Cupid and Psyche is still a work in progress sketch)</p>
<p>The last, and final phase of
the project is this: the sketches will become hyperrealistic paintings on
medium-sized canvas. These will become an
integral part of my portfolio, that will be exhibited across
the world. </p>

<p>What I am asking for, is your help to complete my project. 
Intra Marmore requires time, materials and dedication. Without your help, it will
not be possible to complete it. 
The main objective of the campaign is to raise enough funds to create
and distribute the series. In addition to oil paintings, postcards and
high-definition posters will be created as well so as to spread the message. The benefactors that will
believe in this project and will help complete it will directly be inserted as
part of it; therefore, their names will appear in my website and publications. </p>
<p>We are asking for $5000 in order to cover all
the costs of this idea.  </p>
<p>Here's a breakdown:</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>Fees from
IndieGogo (9% if we don't meet our goal, 4% if we do), Paypal (3%) and Credit
Cards (3%) </p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>Cost of
fulfilling perks (prints, stickers, shipping, packaging, etc. costs are a large
portion of the amount we are asking)</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>The costs
of the materials that will be used, which will be canvas, colours, paint
brushes, thinners, paper material and also the time that the realisation of
this collection requires.</p>

<p>Every person that makes the
decision to contribute to this project will be featured on my official website
and expressly mentioned regarding the creation of this collection. In addition
to this, varying according to donation size, you will be able to receive your
own piece of the collection.</p>
<p>I have tried to offer a wide

simple you are after, or much larger and perhaps even totally exclusive.</p>

specifics:</h4>

out emails and such asking for your photo and name preferences.<i> </i></p>
<p><i>You can choose just one figure; I can draw anybody you desire, your girl/boyfriend, your mum, daughter or son, and your grandparents. I can also draw your pet!</i></p>
<p><b></b></p>
<p><b><i>Photo Specifics</i></b></p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>It is
EXTREMELY hard to draw a portrait based on a tiny, dark, or blurry photo. Please
try to only send me images that are over 500px wide/tall, clear and with decent
lighting. </p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>Please
make sure the photo is mostly focused on the face/upper body. I do much better
work with faces than I do with full body portraits. :) </p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>The best
portraits are based on photos that aren't heavily edited or overexposed.</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>I'd love
to have multiple photos that I can use, if you can--just let me know which one
you would prefer I base it mostly on.</p>

<p>The sketches are ready to be transposed on to canvas. The major risk is the investment  of time in a new project and its spread. No one in the art world has proposed a similar idea yet and I am certain that the galleries and the collectors will recognise it. The problem however, lies in the starting point; in the investment of all those materials, and also in the investment of money to show my collection to the world. Your help will allow me to dedicate myself entirely to it.</p>
<p>No matter what: you will get your perks even if we don't hit our campaign goal (although if we do, it will be a <i>lot </i>easier to fulfill perks). :)</p>
<p>I will keep everyone updated throughout the whole project, every single step of the way.</p>
<p>One thing to bear in mind is that for some of the perks, time will be required. For example, a personalised portrait, or original art work. Following the completion of the campaign, all required printing will take place promptly, and sent out as soon as possible. There are no hidden shipping fees to worry about; these have already been factored in.</p>

Hello! 
My name is Alessandra

These are the works I chose to

The second phase of the
project consists of the creation of paper sketches; which permits a far more detailed study. The sketches were realised in black
and white, with details in colour as to create a guide line to realise afterwardsthe entire series painted on oil. (Cupid and Psyche is still a work in progress sketch)
The last, and final phase of
the project is this: the sketches will become hyperrealistic paintings on
medium-sized canvas. These will become an
integral part of my portfolio, that will be exhibited across
the world. 







What I am asking for, is your help to complete my project. 
Intra Marmore requires time, materials and dedication. Without your help, it will
not be possible to complete it. 
The main objective of the campaign is to raise enough funds to create
and distribute the series. In addition to oil paintings, postcards and
high-definition posters will be created as well so as to spread the message. The benefactors that will
believe in this project and will help complete it will directly be inserted as
part of it; therefore, their names will appear in my website and publications. 
We are asking for $5000 in order to cover all
the costs of this idea.  
Here's a breakdown:
· 
Fees from
IndieGogo (9% if we don't meet our goal, 4% if we do), Paypal (3%) and Credit
Cards (3%) 
· 
Cost of
fulfilling perks (prints, stickers, shipping, packaging, etc. costs are a large
portion of the amount we are asking)
· 
The costs
of the materials that will be used, which will be canvas, colours, paint
brushes, thinners, paper material and also the time that the realisation of
this collection requires.



Every person that makes the
decision to contribute to this project will be featured on my official website
and expressly mentioned regarding the creation of this collection. In addition
to this, varying according to donation size, you will be able to receive your
own piece of the collection.
I have tried to offer a wide
variety of incentives, to suit all tastes; whether it is something small and
simple you are after, or much larger and perhaps even totally exclusive.

All the perks include the dispatch in every part of the world :)

Choosing Postcard Sets:  You can either email me
(info@alessandrapagliuca.com) with which postcard set you would like, message
me on here, or wait for me to contact you after the campaign is over! 


CHOICE 1 - the official catalogue of the series, hard cover and signed with the description of each work, the benefactors names and a personal thanks
CHOICE 2 - Printed High Definition poster cm 35x50


An original sketch of “Intra Marmore”
series (A4 format, 4 pieces available)

Original sketch of Intra
Marmore’s series: as
there are just four of them available and they are all different, if you decide
to buy one of them please write to me in private as soon as you can so that we
can stop that sketch’s sale.





A custom individual pencil portrait (A4
format, 10 pieces available)
Custom Portrait
specifics:
·   After the campaign is over, I will send
out emails and such asking for your photo and name preferences. 
You can choose just one figure; I can draw anybody you desire, your girl/boyfriend, your mum, daughter or son, and your grandparents. I can also draw your pet!

Photo Specifics
· 
It is
EXTREMELY hard to draw a portrait based on a tiny, dark, or blurry photo. Please
try to only send me images that are over 500px wide/tall, clear and with decent
lighting. 
· 
Please
make sure the photo is mostly focused on the face/upper body. I do much better
work with faces than I do with full body portraits. :) 
· 
The best
portraits are based on photos that aren't heavily edited or overexposed.
· 
I'd love
to have multiple photos that I can use, if you can--just let me know which one
you would prefer I base it mostly on.



with one of the original paintings of the series ""Intra marmore"", scale 1:1
(You will choose the painting that you prefer)
5 pieces available




You'll get an original oil painting on canvas from the
“Intra Marmore” series 
(1 piece available). You will choose the one that you prefer :)
Dimensions will be around 100x100 cm and delivery is included in this perk.

For further informations you can mail me: info@alessandrapagliuca.com or visit my official website www.alessandrapagliuca.com ;)




The sketches are ready to be transposed on to canvas. The major risk is the investment  of time in a new project and its spread. No one in the art world has proposed a similar idea yet and I am certain that the galleries and the collectors will recognise it. The problem however, lies in the starting point; in the investment of all those materials, and also in the investment of money to show my collection to the world. Your help will allow me to dedicate myself entirely to it.
No matter what: you will get your perks even if we don't hit our campaign goal (although if we do, it will be a lot easier to fulfill perks). :)
I will keep everyone updated throughout the whole project, every single step of the way.
One thing to bear in mind is that for some of the perks, time will be required. For example, a personalised portrait, or original art work. Following the completion of the campaign, all required printing will take place promptly, and sent out as soon as possible. There are no hidden shipping fees to worry about; these have already been factored in.



If you can't contribute right now, I would really appreciate any and all shares on social media.  Getting the word out about this is half the battle!  I would be so grateful for any help in that regard!  Tell your friends/followers/mom--whoever you feel might be interested in some of the perks, or who would just wanna help out :D

<p>We are looking to start a business that focuses on strengthening the mind-body-spirit connection through various arts and healing modalities. This seed will require much nurturing and support. Once we obtain the funding, we will be offering classes including various forms of yoga, martial arts, dance, and pilates. Additionally, we will be offering sessions for reiki, massage therapy, life-coaching, and esoteric readings. Our center will be attached to a smoothie bar serving in-season and organic fruits and vegetables as well as a shop and a community garden. You can purchase essential oils, healing crystals, seeds and other merchandise (which will also be available online) in the shop.</p>We will also have an online presence with blogs posted regularly on topics such as yoga, spiritual insights, positive body image, relationships, astrology, entrepreneurship and more.  </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>Our initial goal is to raise $10,000, although that would be a very small portion of the amount we hope to raise before opening up our first location.

This seed will require much nurturing and support. Once we obtain the funding, we will be offering classes including various forms of yoga, martial arts, dance, and pilates. Additionally, we will be offering sessions for reiki, massage therapy, life-coaching, and esoteric readings. Our center will be attached to a smoothie bar serving in-season and organic fruits and vegetables as well as a shop and a community garden. You can purchase essential oils, healing crystals, seeds and other merchandise (which will also be available online) in the shop.We will also have an online presence with blogs posted regularly on topics such as yoga, spiritual insights, positive body image, relationships, astrology, entrepreneurship and more.    What We Need & What You Get Our initial goal is to raise $10,000, although that would be a very small portion of the amount we hope to raise before opening up our first location. The funding would be going towards our inventory for the shop and smoothie bar, rent and utilities for the center, paying employees, teachers and masters, starting the website and various functions we would need to perform in order to get started.
As a contributor, there will be several perks available to you. Check out the different rewards we offer to see what you could qualify for!
    The Impact We appreciate any and all donations. If you are unable to donate, you can help us by spreading the word about our cause and sharing our website, or social media accounts. You can use the Indiegogo share tools to share our campaign. Feel free to contact us with any questions.
    Risks & Challenges As this idea needs much nurturing and support, we are prepared to see some challenges in our future. We may have some trouble obtaining the proper funding, and once we do, we may not receive the amount of customers that we hoped for.
Because of these potential challenges, we have decided to first start up our online campaign, blogs, and an online shop to help get the ball rolling. We are prepared to make this dream a reality, no matter how long it takes.",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

(Hairspray) се превърна в първия мащабен студентски спетакъл, който обиколи
България и въодушеви публиката. През следващата 2011-та, на сцена беше представен
„Мулен Руж“, който посети шест от най-големите градове в страната.
Представлението получи многобройни комплименти и адмирации не само от
многохилядната публика, но и от представители на артистичната гилдия и медиите.

<p><b>OUR GOAL</b><b>…</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">“Moulin Rouge”
is a spectacular musical performance that will be presented to the Bulgarian
audience in 2016. The stage version of the popular movie will come to life in
Circus “Balkanski” and will tour Bulgaria reaching the spectators in all major
cities including Sofia, Plovdiv, Varna, Bourgas, Rouse, Veliko Tarnovo, and
more. </p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">We are
determined to present a new and innovative product for the Bulgarian artistic
environment by providing a true Broadway-like experience. The project features
a cast of 70 people who will perform in the biggest travelling circus on the
Balkans. The show will be presented in the style of the American cabaret and
performed in direct contact with the audience. The cast members are selected through
a nation-wide audition, which attracted hundreds of talented candidates. Experienced
choreographers, directors, set designers, vocal directors, orchestra and
stunts, as well as professional sound and light equipment, will all contribute
to the high quality of the project. Our ultimate goal is to create an
outstanding cultural product. 

</p><p><b><span>WHAT WE NEED</span></b><b>…</b></p>
<p>The
project’s budget is 150 000 BGN (~ $86 000). After deducting the
estimated ticket sales revenue, the show requires additional 30 000 BGN (~
$17 200) to cover part of the capital cost, i.e. costumes, set, rehearsal halls
rental, etc.</p>

2010, the AUBG musical “Hairspray” became the first large-scale student
production to tour Bulgaria and excite the audience. In 2011, a new production “Moulin
Rouge” visited six of the largest cities in the country. The show received
numerous compliments and admirations not only from the thousands of spectators,
but also from representatives of the artistic circles and the media. Now, 5
years later, we are ready to realize the full potential of the project and to once
again make you a part of the magic that is Moulin Rouge – more spectacular,

КОИ СМЕ
НИЕ… 
Главните организатори на проекта са бивши възпитаници на
Американския университет в България (АУБ), участвали активно в поставянето на
мюзикъли от 2008г. насам. През 2010 година мюзикълът на АУБ  „Лак за Коса“
(Hairspray) се превърна в първия мащабен студентски спетакъл, който обиколи
България и въодушеви публиката. През следващата 2011-та, на сцена беше представен
„Мулен Руж“, който посети шест от най-големите градове в страната.
Представлението получи многобройни комплименти и адмирации не само от
многохилядната публика, но и от представители на артистичната гилдия и медиите.
Сега, 5 години по-късно, сме готови да разгърнем целия потенциал на проекта и
да Ви пренесем отново в магията на Мулен Руж - по мащабен, по-вълнуващ и
по-завладяващ от всякога. 
OUR GOAL…
“Moulin Rouge”
is a spectacular musical performance that will be presented to the Bulgarian
audience in 2016. The stage version of the popular movie will come to life in
Circus “Balkanski” and will tour Bulgaria reaching the spectators in all major
cities including Sofia, Plovdiv, Varna, Bourgas, Rouse, Veliko Tarnovo, and
more. 
We are
determined to present a new and innovative product for the Bulgarian artistic
environment by providing a true Broadway-like experience. The project features
a cast of 70 people who will perform in the biggest travelling circus on the
Balkans. The show will be presented in the style of the American cabaret and
performed in direct contact with the audience. The cast members are selected through
a nation-wide audition, which attracted hundreds of talented candidates. Experienced
choreographers, directors, set designers, vocal directors, orchestra and
stunts, as well as professional sound and light equipment, will all contribute
to the high quality of the project. Our ultimate goal is to create an
outstanding cultural product. 

WHAT WE NEED…
The
project’s budget is 150 000 BGN (~ $86 000). After deducting the
estimated ticket sales revenue, the show requires additional 30 000 BGN (~
$17 200) to cover part of the capital cost, i.e. costumes, set, rehearsal halls
rental, etc.
We turn to all

experience by introducing you to the magic of the “Moulin Rouge”!

WHO WE ARE…
The main
organizers of the project are alumni of the American University in Bulgaria (AUBG)
who have been active participants in the staging of musicals since 2008. In
2010, the AUBG musical “Hairspray” became the first large-scale student
production to tour Bulgaria and excite the audience. In 2011, a new production “Moulin
Rouge” visited six of the largest cities in the country. The show received
numerous compliments and admirations not only from the thousands of spectators,
but also from representatives of the artistic circles and the media. Now, 5
years later, we are ready to realize the full potential of the project and to once
again make you a part of the magic that is Moulin Rouge – more spectacular,
more exciting and more compelling than ever!",4.0,0,"1 Campaign

</p><p><span style=""font-size: 24px; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 30px;"">
</span></p><p><b>History</b></p>
<p>“Doc” Paskowitz was a true legend in the surfing
community.  As chronicled in the hit
movie Surfwise, Doc and his wife Juliette raised their 9 kids on an endless
surf trip in a 24-foot camper van.  Doc spent
his life promoting a health and surf-centric lifestyle, not just in his
well-reviewed book called Surfing ad Health, but in the way he lived his life and
raised his family.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1148428/files/20150113194433-la-et-0130-sneaks-03-jpg-20141113.jpg?1421207073"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>When Doc passed away in November at the age of 93, he was
one of the last of the original surfers from the age of Duke Kahanamoku, who
brought surfing to mainland America in 1912. 
Doc famously ditched his career as a Stanford-educated physician to live
a lifestyle of surf and travel, thus creating the vagabond culture that is so
pervasive in today’s surf world.  </p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;"">Legacy</p>
<p>One of Doc’s last wishes was for the creation of a place
where this legacy could be on display for future generations of surfers.  A place where the past and the future of
surfing could come together to “talk story”, and learn of the virtues of
surfing and health that Doc extolled throughout his life.  </p>
<p>Doc’s youngest son Joshua Ben is dedicated to fulfilling his
father’s wish.  And by participating in
this campaign you can be a part of it. </p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1148483/files/20150113201338-1464015_1403287519.7798.jpg?1421208818"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Josh, with the help of his family, friends and you, is
opening a surf art and lifestyle gallery called <i>Aloha Doc – Prescriptions for a Surf Lifestyle</i>.  When you live the Spirit of Aloha, you create
positive feelings and thoughts, which are never gone. They exist in space,
multiply and spread over to others.  Doc lived
with the spirit of Aloha as much as anyone, and he always signed his name
“Aloha, Doc”.  We can’t think of a better
tribute to an amazing person than to name the gallery after this term of
endearment.  </p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1148482/files/20150113201308-8416337.28.jpg?1421208788"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Joshua Ben Paskowitz has been drawing larger than life
figures since he was a young boy in the back of the family camper.  He’s
now taken to creating impressionist artistic renderings of some of the most
famous scenes in surf history and paintings of the iconic places that were a
part of his life journey.  Josh’s art has
been featured in art shows across Southern California over the last several
years to rave reviews from collectors and the media.  </p><p></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""326"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2F639R2lbd-KM%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3D639R2lbd-KM&amp;image=http%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2F639R2lbd-KM%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube"" width=""580""></iframe></div><br/><p></p>

<p><b>Help us build an amazing space to connect the legends of surf with the next generation</b></p><p></p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;"">Project and Goals</p>
<p>We have secured a space for the Aloha Doc gallery in the Los
Molinos district in San Clemente, CA, not far from San Onofre State Beach where
Doc and his family became a fixture in the 1970s.  We are located right across the street from
the famous Clark Foam factory in the heart of “glass alley” where some of
history’s most famous shapers still practice the art of hand shaping
surfboards.  </p>
<p>Josh has been using this space as a private studio since May
of 2014, but now we want to open it up to the public.  This will require some work, as the space is
not retail ready.  We need to purchase
fixtures, lighting, furnishings, paint, displays, and all the other stuff you
need to open a retail store.  Some of the
money raised will be used to curate, mount, frame and preserve all of the
historic artifacts from the 93-year adventure that was Doc’s life, as well as
produce products based upon Josh’s artwork and Doc’s life.  We plan to put all the money from this campaign into the gallery, so even if we don't hit our goal, by<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> supporting this campaign, you will be helping build a home for the legacy of the surf adventure, Paskowitz style.  </span></p><h3>We've got some amazing perks for you:</h3><div>

</div>","Aloha Doc - Prescriptions for a Surf Lifestyle

History
“Doc” Paskowitz was a true legend in the surfing
community.  As chronicled in the hit
movie Surfwise, Doc and his wife Juliette raised their 9 kids on an endless
surf trip in a 24-foot camper van.  Doc spent
his life promoting a health and surf-centric lifestyle, not just in his
well-reviewed book called Surfing ad Health, but in the way he lived his life and
raised his family.
When Doc passed away in November at the age of 93, he was
one of the last of the original surfers from the age of Duke Kahanamoku, who
brought surfing to mainland America in 1912. 
Doc famously ditched his career as a Stanford-educated physician to live
a lifestyle of surf and travel, thus creating the vagabond culture that is so
pervasive in today’s surf world.  
Legacy
One of Doc’s last wishes was for the creation of a place
where this legacy could be on display for future generations of surfers.  A place where the past and the future of
surfing could come together to “talk story”, and learn of the virtues of
surfing and health that Doc extolled throughout his life.  
Doc’s youngest son Joshua Ben is dedicated to fulfilling his
father’s wish.  And by participating in
this campaign you can be a part of it. 
Josh, with the help of his family, friends and you, is
opening a surf art and lifestyle gallery called Aloha Doc – Prescriptions for a Surf Lifestyle.  When you live the Spirit of Aloha, you create
positive feelings and thoughts, which are never gone. They exist in space,
multiply and spread over to others.  Doc lived
with the spirit of Aloha as much as anyone, and he always signed his name
“Aloha, Doc”.  We can’t think of a better
tribute to an amazing person than to name the gallery after this term of
endearment.  
Joshua Ben Paskowitz has been drawing larger than life
figures since he was a young boy in the back of the family camper.  He’s
now taken to creating impressionist artistic renderings of some of the most
famous scenes in surf history and paintings of the iconic places that were a
part of his life journey.  Josh’s art has
been featured in art shows across Southern California over the last several
years to rave reviews from collectors and the media.  

Help us build an amazing space to connect the legends of surf with the next generation
Project and Goals
We have secured a space for the Aloha Doc gallery in the Los
Molinos district in San Clemente, CA, not far from San Onofre State Beach where
Doc and his family became a fixture in the 1970s.  We are located right across the street from
the famous Clark Foam factory in the heart of “glass alley” where some of
history’s most famous shapers still practice the art of hand shaping
surfboards.  
Josh has been using this space as a private studio since May
of 2014, but now we want to open it up to the public.  This will require some work, as the space is
not retail ready.  We need to purchase
fixtures, lighting, furnishings, paint, displays, and all the other stuff you
need to open a retail store.  Some of the
money raised will be used to curate, mount, frame and preserve all of the
historic artifacts from the 93-year adventure that was Doc’s life, as well as
produce products based upon Josh’s artwork and Doc’s life.  We plan to put all the money from this campaign into the gallery, so even if we don't hit our goal, by supporting this campaign, you will be helping build a home for the legacy of the surf adventure, Paskowitz style.  We've got some amazing perks for you:

Lightening Bolt Sticker Pack - $5


4 X 6 print of Josh’s original painting ""Banner Wave"" suitable for framing - $15





Night Wave Art T-Shirt by Josh Ben Paskowitz - $35
High quality T-Shirt imprinted with the original Night Wave design by Joshua ben Paskowitz.  Please specify size when ordering (S/M/L/XL) 


Surfing and Health Book by Doc Paskowitz - $50

Wouldn’t it be just the thing if you could solve all your earthly problems, and even a few metaphysical woes, with one book? And, even better, if it wasn’t surrounded by some kinda religious dogma? Of course! Let Doc tell you about it himself.
Surfing and Health was written by Doc Paskowitz back in 1997. Doc, who surfed and was still active in the game of physical love until he passed at 93-years old,  advocates a basic diet, free from the crap we sling into our vessels, and simple breezy exercise. Like surfing. 


16x20 Night Wave Print - $100
Suitable for framing, a high-quality print of the original Night Wave acrylic on canvas painting by Joshua Ben Paskowitz.  


Exclusive Invitation to a Paint Nite with Josh at Aloha Doc Studio - $150
Josh will supply canvases, easels, brushes, paint, refreshments (wine!) and step-by-step instructions.  You go home with amazing memories, a one-of-a-kind painting and newfound skills.  Price includes admission for one.  Share with your friends and make it a party!



Limited Edition Print signed by Josh and Gerry
Lopez - $250
Limited edition print numbered and signed by both the artist, Joshua Paskowitz and the subject, the legendary Mr. Pipeline Gerry Lopez.  Suitable for framing, earliest purchasers will be sent the lowest numbers 1-25.

<li><p><span>Caesura is a successful, major public art installation installed in a very challenging and provocative site. It has received a warm welcome from the community and it has held up against the elements.

Our grants and commissions ultimately were not enough to cover the final costs of installation. Additionally, we need to raise funds for the continued upkeep and long-term preservation of the piece, including de-install and relocation this winter or spring.

<div><br/></div> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>More about this project:</p>
<p></p>
<p><span>Having passed the one-year mark since this project began, it is remarkable to have seen such an ambitious piece come to fruition. This project involved months of outreach, community meetings and discussion, archival research, design, and construction. caesura was made for, and with, the neighborhood. The piece is a place to gather and remember the history of this important Harlem site. The Acropolis is a (somewhat) secret gem, and this project represents an important step in carving out spaces for public art and other events in and around this Park, and in holding a place for Harlem’s vibrant traditions of creativity and community.</span></p>
<p>From the NYC Parks Press Release:</p>
<p><i>NYC Parks is pleased to announce the installation of caesura: a forum, a collaborative architectural and sound installation by artist Jessica Feldman and architects Jerome W Haferd &amp; K Brandt Knapp.</i><br/></p>cae•su•ra: a forum<i> is inspired by Marcus Garvey Park’s iconic antebellum Mount Morris Fire Watchtower &amp; Bell, and by Harlem’s vibrant tradition of activism and rallies. The bell is silent now, as the tower was temporarily dismantled in 2015 as the first phase for its reconstruction. Simultaneously, Harlem is undergoing dynamic change and New York City is experiencing a resurgence of public culture. caesura seeks to temporarily fill an architectural gap – and create a social space – by echoing and inverting the form and function of the absent tower. Like the bell, caesura aims to call up the neighborhood, to preserve and revitalize Harlem’s histories, and to connect newer and older community members to each other, by reactivating this site for congregation, viewing, and listening. The installation reframes history with a temporary structure and sound. A “caesura” is a break or pause, a place to catch your breath, most specifically in ancient spoken-word art.</i><p><i></i></p>
</div><div><br/></div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges </h3>
<span>We did it! The production and installation of this project was expensive, time-consuming, and challenging. We are pleased that the piece has held up well against the elements and has received positive responses from the community. Public art doesn’t maintain itself, however. caesura requires regular upkeep by the artists, and eventually will need to be professionally relocated in a way that is gentle to the park and preserves the piece. That process will be costly, hard work, and well worth it. Your donation helps keep this piece alive.</span><br/>

The Acropolis is a (somewhat) secret gem, and this project represents an important step in carving out spaces for public art and other events in and around this Park, and in holding a place for Harlem’s vibrant traditions of creativity and community.
From the NYC Parks Press Release:
NYC Parks is pleased to announce the installation of caesura: a forum, a collaborative architectural and sound installation by artist Jessica Feldman and architects Jerome W Haferd & K Brandt Knapp.cae•su•ra: a forum is inspired by Marcus Garvey Park’s iconic antebellum Mount Morris Fire Watchtower & Bell, and by Harlem’s vibrant tradition of activism and rallies. The bell is silent now, as the tower was temporarily dismantled in 2015 as the first phase for its reconstruction. Simultaneously, Harlem is undergoing dynamic change and New York City is experiencing a resurgence of public culture. caesura seeks to temporarily fill an architectural gap – and create a social space – by echoing and inverting the form and function of the absent tower. Like the bell, caesura aims to call up the neighborhood, to preserve and revitalize Harlem’s histories, and to connect newer and older community members to each other, by reactivating this site for congregation, viewing, and listening. The installation reframes history with a temporary structure and sound. A “caesura” is a break or pause, a place to catch your breath, most specifically in ancient spoken-word art.
  Risks & Challenges 
We did it! The production and installation of this project was expensive, time-consuming, and challenging. We are pleased that the piece has held up well against the elements and has received positive responses from the community. Public art doesn’t maintain itself, however. caesura requires regular upkeep by the artists, and eventually will need to be professionally relocated in a way that is gentle to the park and preserves the piece. That process will be costly, hard work, and well worth it. Your donation helps keep this piece alive.

<p>My name is Nitasha Schneider. I was born in Cheyenne, WY and raised in Grand Junction, CO. I will be 22 a week before my deadline. I currently work as a server and do odd jobs on the side to support myself. I have been traveling for roughly the last two years outside of my home town, joining the following of love and light to search for the deeper meaning of my existence. What I have found thus far, is a true appreciation for nature. Last summer, whilst hiking along the Appalachian Trail I set my intentions on becoming aware of the small things. Listening and watching to quiet my mind. Once I found my first four leaf clover hiding beneath a root in the middle of the trail, I knew I was on the right track. I started collecting these small thoughtful moments in my notebook, which was later turned into the landscape collage featured with butterfly wing mountains and robin's egg clouds (made in a grocery store parking lot, while living out of my backpack). </p>
<p>My idea is to create the perfect thoughtful gift. Making daily intentions to search for the little things, perfectly preserving them and setting them in recycled wood. Each piece will take anywhere from 3-5 hours depending on the size. I am also encouraging people to send me requests for personalized pieces and small forest floor finds of their own to help inspire exploration and adventure. I have been collecting and pressing forest floor finds lately in Northern Michigan to create a prototype which I will post a video of soon. I will be moving to Oregon two weeks before my deadline ends, which gives me plenty of opportunity for more forest floor finds on the way. </p>

<h3><b>About Plays in Mud Pottery and Kelsey Schissel
</b></h3>
<div>Hi!  Thank you for your interest in supporting Plays in Mud Pottery!  </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>I have been working hard to make a living producing one of a kind functional pottery.  Its been slow going but I have not given up hope yet!  I graduated from UNC-Asheville in 2003 and set up my pottery studio in the River Arts District and in 2005 bought a house and moved my studio to the unfinished basement.  I quickly out grew the basement and in 2008 we built a studio in the back yard.  This small (192 sf) space has been fantastic, exactly what I needed and in 2012 I was accepted as a member of the prestigious Southern Highlands Craft Guild.  </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>I have been participating in Fine Art and Craft shows around the area and this year branched out into wholesale and now have my work in 3 galleries around Asheville. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>My goal is to market my pottery to galleries around the nation and become a nationally recognized ceramic artist.  </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>I am currently working toward this goal by taking small business classes at AB tech and Haywood community colleges, meeting with mentors in the ceramic craft world including Lynn Jenkins - President of the Southern Highlands Craft Guild- and have been excepted to participate in American Made, which is a wholesale trade show.  </div>
<div>
<p><br/></p>
</div>
<div>
<b>Will you please help me? </b> I have been working for years perfecting my craft and now I need your help to further my craft business.  With your help and my effort and perseverance I will move from an artist struggling to succeed  to a prosperous successful artist, nationally recognized.   </div>
<div>   </div> <p><br/></p>
</div><div> <h3>What Plays in Mud Needs! </h3>
<div><br/></div>
<div>For this venture I need $10,892.00.  </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>That's a lot of money and here is how it breaks down.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>$1,665 for the American Made wholesale trade show. <b>Already excepted !!! </b>  This includes the booth fee and revamping the current booth design to be gallery spec including white walls, more lighting and a fresh coat of paint. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">$3000 for another kiln - with only 1 kiln I do not have enough production space to keep up with all the orders I receive.  </span><br/>
</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>$4000 for studio expansion and moving to a new space. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>$1,000 for shipping perks.  Each item has had shipping added to it and even if I don't make my goal, there will still be enough to send out your selection.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>$892 for Indiegogo fees.  <br/>
</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">$335 for clay and materials to make all the perks as well as enough clay to make the 1st couple of wholesale orders.  </span><br/>
</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Even if I don't reach my end goal <b>all the funds raised</b> will still go toward growing Plays in Mud into a nationally recognized ceramic studio.  It may just take  a little longer to get there...</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>
<h3>What you get in return! </h3>
<br/>
</div>
<div>
<b>Everyone who makes a donation will have my gratitude forever.</b>  I will be forever thankful for the opportunity you helped create.  </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>
<b>To thank you for your help</b> I am offering some one of a kind pieces.  All the pieces will be decorated with a special limited addition Indiegogo inspired stamped pattern called <i>Shooting Star</i>.  Once the perks have been made the pattern will be retired and not used again.  The only people who will have pieces with this pattern will be the people who donated.  Once you donate you will also have the option in the future to order additional pieces with the shooting star pattern but you will be the only ones.  I will develop the pattern over the course of the campaign and you will be the 1st to see it.  I want you to see how valuable your support is and share in the passion I have for crafting a creative living.  Pots will be very carefully packed and shipped to you and if you are in the area, you are welcome to stop by and pick up your perk, so I can personally thank you.  </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>
<span style=""background-color: initial;""><b>I will keep you informed along the way.</b>  I will send out newsletters filled with pictures and info, letting you know how the campaign is going, when the new kiln will be delivered, what the new studio space is like and how my work is received at the wholesale show and how galleries are responding to the marketing packages I send them.  </span><br/>
</div>
<div><span style=""background-color: initial;""><br/></span></div>
<div>
<b>Page of Gratitude on my website. </b> I will create a Page of Gratitude on my website and blog, listing each of your names and can add links to your website if provided.  </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact:</h3>
<div><br/></div>
<div>
<b>My life will be forever changed.</b>   With your help and my effort and perseverance I will move from an artist struggling to succeed  to a prosperous artist faster than I can alone.  </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>With our combined efforts <span style=""background-color: initial;"">I am going to make a difference in my West Asheville community.  I believe that local is best and West Asheville is best!  I shop in West Asheville, have my hair done in West Asheville and when I need repairs around the studio or the house painted I hire people and businesses from West Asheville.  </span>
</div>
<div><span style=""background-color: initial;""><br/></span></div>
<div>When I move to a larger studio space it will be in West Asheville.  </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Once I reach a point that I need help in the studio<span style=""background-color: initial;""> and its time to hire someone, I want to hire specifically from the West Asheville community and pay them a wage they can live on, at least $13.50 an hour.  This will make a difference in their quality of life allowing them to actually live and not just work to live.   Even though I may not be able to offer health insurance, at the beginning, I will offer an employee health savings plan to help with any unforeseeable costs. </span>
</div>
<div><span style=""background-color: initial;""><br/></span></div>
<div>I am in the process now of setting up a mentorship program for aspiring potters in Western North Carolina.  I am going to offer 1 potter a 1 year mentorship to help them realize their goal of being an independent  studio artist.  </div>
<div><br/></div>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<div><br/></div>
<div><b>What happens if I don't do very well at the American Made Wholesale show?</b></div>
<div>Well its a good thing my eggs are not all in one basket.  I am also going to be marketing to galleries before and after the American Made show.  I have made a variation of the Indiegogo video that I will be sending to galleries showcasing my work, to create wholesale accounts along the way.  You can view the gallery video from my YouTube account Plays in Mud Pottery.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><b>What happens if I don't make my goal amount with Indiegogo?</b></div>
<div>I am still working hard to make Plays in Mud as successful as possible it may just take me a bit longer. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><b>What happens if I raise all the funds with Indiegogo?</b></div>
<div>Perhaps people won't view this as a challenge but I do.  Its scary embarking on this journey and what if I do raise the funds?  Then I feel that I have a responsibility to succeed even more than I do now.  I can assure you that I will spend each and every cent I raise toward the success of my business. I will work harder then I can imagine now, to succeed. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><b>What happens if I don't raise any money with Indiegogo?  </b></div>
<div>I will not be able to attend the American Made Wholesale show, but I will still have the videos I made for Indiegogo and I will still have my ambition, both of which will help me tremendously.  I will have learned a great deal and again it may take a lot longer than I would like but eventually I will realize my goals.</div>

Hi!  Thank you for your interest in supporting Plays in Mud Pottery!  

I have been working hard to make a living producing one of a kind functional pottery.  Its been slow going but I have not given up hope yet!  I graduated from UNC-Asheville in 2003 and set up my pottery studio in the River Arts District and in 2005 bought a house and moved my studio to the unfinished basement.  I quickly out grew the basement and in 2008 we built a studio in the back yard.  This small (192 sf) space has been fantastic, exactly what I needed and in 2012 I was accepted as a member of the prestigious Southern Highlands Craft Guild.  

I have been participating in Fine Art and Craft shows around the area and this year branched out into wholesale and now have my work in 3 galleries around Asheville. 

My goal is to market my pottery to galleries around the nation and become a nationally recognized ceramic artist.  

I am currently working toward this goal by taking small business classes at AB tech and Haywood community colleges, meeting with mentors in the ceramic craft world including Lynn Jenkins - President of the Southern Highlands Craft Guild- and have been excepted to participate in American Made, which is a wholesale trade show.  




Will you please help me?  I have been working for years perfecting my craft and now I need your help to further my craft business.  With your help and my effort and perseverance I will move from an artist struggling to succeed  to a prosperous successful artist, nationally recognized.   
    
 What Plays in Mud Needs! 

For this venture I need $10,892.00.  

That's a lot of money and here is how it breaks down.

$1,665 for the American Made wholesale trade show. Already excepted !!!   This includes the booth fee and revamping the current booth design to be gallery spec including white walls, more lighting and a fresh coat of paint. 


$3000 for another kiln - with only 1 kiln I do not have enough production space to keep up with all the orders I receive.  


$4000 for studio expansion and moving to a new space. 

$1,000 for shipping perks.  Each item has had shipping added to it and even if I don't make my goal, there will still be enough to send out your selection.  
 
$892 for Indiegogo fees.  



$335 for clay and materials to make all the perks as well as enough clay to make the 1st couple of wholesale orders.  


Even if I don't reach my end goal all the funds raised will still go toward growing Plays in Mud into a nationally recognized ceramic studio.  It may just take  a little longer to get there...


What you get in return! 



Everyone who makes a donation will have my gratitude forever.  I will be forever thankful for the opportunity you helped create.  


To thank you for your help I am offering some one of a kind pieces.  All the pieces will be decorated with a special limited addition Indiegogo inspired stamped pattern called Shooting Star.  Once the perks have been made the pattern will be retired and not used again.  The only people who will have pieces with this pattern will be the people who donated.  Once you donate you will also have the option in the future to order additional pieces with the shooting star pattern but you will be the only ones.  I will develop the pattern over the course of the campaign and you will be the 1st to see it.  I want you to see how valuable your support is and share in the passion I have for crafting a creative living.  Pots will be very carefully packed and shipped to you and if you are in the area, you are welcome to stop by and pick up your perk, so I can personally thank you.  


I will keep you informed along the way.  I will send out newsletters filled with pictures and info, letting you know how the campaign is going, when the new kiln will be delivered, what the new studio space is like and how my work is received at the wholesale show and how galleries are responding to the marketing packages I send them.  



Page of Gratitude on my website.  I will create a Page of Gratitude on my website and blog, listing each of your names and can add links to your website if provided.  


    The Impact:


My life will be forever changed.   With your help and my effort and perseverance I will move from an artist struggling to succeed  to a prosperous artist faster than I can alone.  

With our combined efforts I am going to make a difference in my West Asheville community.  I believe that local is best and West Asheville is best!  I shop in West Asheville, have my hair done in West Asheville and when I need repairs around the studio or the house painted I hire people and businesses from West Asheville.  


When I move to a larger studio space it will be in West Asheville.  

Once I reach a point that I need help in the studio and its time to hire someone, I want to hire specifically from the West Asheville community and pay them a wage they can live on, at least $13.50 an hour.  This will make a difference in their quality of life allowing them to actually live and not just work to live.   Even though I may not be able to offer health insurance, at the beginning, I will offer an employee health savings plan to help with any unforeseeable costs. 


I am in the process now of setting up a mentorship program for aspiring potters in Western North Carolina.  I am going to offer 1 potter a 1 year mentorship to help them realize their goal of being an independent  studio artist.  

    Risks & Challenges

What happens if I don't do very well at the American Made Wholesale show?
Well its a good thing my eggs are not all in one basket.  I am also going to be marketing to galleries before and after the American Made show.  I have made a variation of the Indiegogo video that I will be sending to galleries showcasing my work, to create wholesale accounts along the way.  You can view the gallery video from my YouTube account Plays in Mud Pottery.

What happens if I don't make my goal amount with Indiegogo?
I am still working hard to make Plays in Mud as successful as possible it may just take me a bit longer. 

What happens if I raise all the funds with Indiegogo?
Perhaps people won't view this as a challenge but I do.  Its scary embarking on this journey and what if I do raise the funds?  Then I feel that I have a responsibility to succeed even more than I do now.  I can assure you that I will spend each and every cent I raise toward the success of my business. I will work harder then I can imagine now, to succeed. 

What happens if I don't raise any money with Indiegogo?  
I will not be able to attend the American Made Wholesale show, but I will still have the videos I made for Indiegogo and I will still have my ambition, both of which will help me tremendously.  I will have learned a great deal and again it may take a lot longer than I would like but eventually I will realize my goals.

<p>Come to think of it, we've been flying for a couple of years, flying on experiences with amazing people fighting cancer who drew us to dedicate a part of our life to their journey. A journey of strength &amp; pain,  and one that has made us more determined to find a way to make it more about strength and less about pain for them. </p>
<p>Of course there are the traditional means of help; financial, medical, research. It all remains important, but what about aiding their healing process through art? Almost everyone we've met on these experiences express their healthiest times is when they're involved in a creative project that empowers them to kick cancer in the butt, and if we have the power (which we do), to gather up local talents &amp; design such projects, then why not be that sidekick to those heroes! </p>
<p>Its is our shared belief in Art Therapy that Superhope and Kids &amp; Art Foundation have teamed up to continue to match families touched by cancer with local talents.

<p>The best part of this experience is watching the children embrace their self-made Superheroes, and witness their care-givers shed tears in awe of their child's strength. Parents seek every means to try and rid their young child from this ugly monster, and are open to such experiences that clearly boost their child's mental state, which has been proved to boost their immunity system &amp; aid with their fight against cancer. Your belief in the power of imagination is so important for the child's livelihood and for their care-giver's hopefulness.

Out of our love for Lake Atitlan we are raising funds to bring renowned Dutch artists Jeroen Koolhas and Dre Urhahn to produce a Color Lab with the townspeople of Santa Catarina Palopo as the first step in a much more ambitious project that will eventually result in the entire lakeside town being used as a giant canvas for a monumental piece of art.    The Color Lab will bring together community leaders to work in creating a color palette and a design that most represents the town.
We believe in the power of art as an agent for social change and in this case as an empowerment tool that will enhance a sense of pride and belonging in Santa Catarina Palopo, one of the dozens of  communities in the Lake Atitlan basin.
This workshop will mark the first step in a process that will revitalize an entire community, creating new job and small business opportunities and a creative outlet and empowerment opportunity  for the majority young population of Santa Catarina.
The Lake Atitlan basin and its inhabitants need the commitment of all of us to ensure the survival and future of this dynamic, beautiful and diverse natural resource.

been dedicated to supporting Native artists and strengthening Indigenous cultures.
We’ve helped thousands of Native artists from
around the country and across the Pacific Rim to revitalize ancient practices,
explore new media, and market their work. While always maintaining our focus on
the Pacific Northwest, our work to promote indigenous arts and cultures has expanded
over time into national and international arenas through residencies,
exhibitions, and gatherings of Native artists. 
We
hope you will become part of our most exciting initiative to date: the creation
of an Indigenous Arts Campus surrounding the Longhouse at The Evergreen
State College in Olympia, Washington.
Imagine …
· 
A complex of studios where the art-making facilities and the surrounding 7.25
acre campus are based on indigenous architectural design and cultural concepts.
· 
A place where culture
keepers, artists and creative people illustrate the balance of indigenous life—honoring
the past while visioning into the future. 
· 
A place that allows artists to preserve and reinvigorate
traditional practices and evolve new ones, to honor ancestors and prepare new
generations.  
· 
A home for a planned Master of Fine Arts in Indigenous Arts at
Evergreen.
The Fiber Arts Studio for weavers is the next dedicated indigenous arts space we are building. We are fundraising to support the artists working on the structural artwork and to close the gap on fully funding the construction of the building.
The Western entrance will reflect
the art and cultures of the  West Coast and Salish tribes while the Eastern entrance of the studio will reference Māori art and culture. Weavers
of all cultures will be able to work with new kinds of materials, share weaving
techniques with artists from around the world, and preserve and pass on
important traditions and knowledge to the next generation. 
The Longhouse has received a significant part of the funding from private foundations, Washington State Tribes, The Evergreen State College and individual donors.


We need your help to keep the magic
alive.  Could you support the magic of Native
arts with your contribution to the “Weaving a New Future” fundraising campaign? If you would like to donate but feel uncomfortable using your credit card on line, an option would be to use a MasterCard or Visa gift card to make the transaction. That way you won't miss out on the array of great perks.
All contributions to this campaign to support the Fiber Arts
Studio and artists will be made to The Evergreen State College Foundation on
behalf of the Longhouse. Contributions are tax-deductible to the extent
allowable by law. As a token of appreciation for your gift, you may select from
a variety of perks, determined by your level of contribution. Thanks for
supporting indigenous arts!

Every contribution, no matter the size, is a welcome gift that will help our vision become a reality. If you cannot contribute to the Weaving A New Future campaign, your support in getting the word out about our fundraising campaign would be a great help. Please share with your friends and your networks and everyone you know who supports indigenous arts!

<p>Here is the first part of my campaign, my book entitled, ""So Your Lover's A Zombie: A Guide to Happy and Safe Intimate Relationships with The Living Dead""! And yes, it is a mouthful, but a funny one. We've all learned how to survive the zombie apocalypse, but what do you do after? A loved has turned and you're not quite ready to let go, what do you, how do you continue the relationship. Will she still look good in that thong? These are questions I hope my book will answer for you. So when the apocalypse comes and passes, you'll know how to keep the love alive, mostly. Now my second part is a bit more normal pin-up art. If you're not familiar with the style, it's creating beautiful and at most times, sensual, but in my case, twisted and definitely funny. I started drawing actually to get rid of depression and nightmares and it didn't help either. But from that, I draw inspiration and drive to make this dream a reality and something that can't be taken away from me. Now I've tried to make come true before but I can't do it alone. So I'm asking for help to bring my Madness to life and maybe it can be a distraction and a bit of fun for you as well.<br/></p>

<div>""Thanks for taking a moment to check out my profile. My name is Keith Burgess, and welcome to my Madness. Like many people here I have a dream of making something I love become reality for me. Now, I've had many dreams in my lifetime, for example, I'm a huge fan of Japanese animation. I wanted to be a part of that industry and I did just that. I first became the fan relations person for Manga Entertainment, and then I was given the opportunity to stretch my voice skills.  I gave voice to my favorite video game character ""Akuma"" from Street Fighter Alpha. From there, I went on to voice several other characters from more anime to even a couple of video games. My life was on track and my next dream was becoming a reality. Being a father and having a family of my own. This one didn't work out as planned and in order to be a part of my son's life, I walked away from three possible careers. And I would do it again in a heartbeat. It's not how I planned or even imagined my introduction to fatherhood would go. But it is what it is, and every minute I have with my son is precious to me. For the last eight years, I've kept my head down and my fingers to the grindstone all so I can be close to my son. Over that time a skill I used to cope has become my new dream. Drawing and character design, as well as writing, has become a passion of mine. So much so, that I've written my first book and started creating pin-up art of characters from my imagination. They're disturbing, funny, and definitely a little out there. Which I think we all need at one time or another in order to deal with the world around us. And that's what this campaign is about. Making the madness of the world around us something we can use to escape. And when things suck, maybe bring a smile to our faces or a momentary escape from the suck.""-Keith<br/>

We are a couple of artists who travel by hitchhiking.  We use this inspiring way of traveling as a creative process (while we are on the road, David takes pictures and Ángela makes drawings): We want to share with you the magic places and people we find on the way!This project is very important for us because it embodies our passion for traveling and for making art: Autostop Postals brings together the excitement of being picked up by a car/motorcycle/truck, the magic of sharing with new people, and the wonder of making art with all the stories of the road. Also! we want to show you that there is a solidary world, that there are people who dare to pick us up in their 
cars regardless of geographical or political boundaries. AND!... How nice to have those memories in a collectible series of postcards!Some images of how we have done the project:
WE BOTH REPORTING OUR TRIPS IN SOCIAL NETWORKS:

ANGELA EDITING HER DRAWINGS:
DAVID TAKING PHOTOS DURING THE TRIPS:
 The Poscards:
Autostop Postcards - Chapter Colombia is a box of 25 cards (15 photographs and 10 illustrations) about trips we have done in Hitchhiking through Colombia.   For now, we are going to make the nicest box of postals of our country, but our dream is to have a version for each of the countries that we travel by Hitchhiking !!!
Each of the postals will be 5.5 in  x 4 in printed in high density propalcote paper.  The 25 postcards will be packed in a box with a nice design.

<p>I decided to make MagnaSpot when I purchased my new stainless steel refrigerator and realized that I couldn’t put magnets on it. As I was making MagnaSpot, I realized that they could work on other surfaces too. So, instead of having to use tape (which always seemed to rip or leave a sticky residue on my pictures/posters/walls) or push pins (that leave holes in walls and the items they are holding), I could just use MagnaSpots! With this realization, I knew it was a product that others could benefit from too!</p>

<p>We have done a lot of research and made many prototypes. Our final design is ready. We have material suppliers lined up, so the Indiegogo funding will help us make the purchase of the materials to make the MagnaSpot and to make the magnet housing. We will also use the
funding for production costs, to design retail packaging, to enhance our website, and start our
e-commerce platform. </p>
<p>We understand how important it is that you receive the products you support in a timely manner. We have already had one timely delivered, fully funded project  on Indiegogo, so we understand how to fulfill perks in an
efficient and timely manner. </p>

</div>","The first part is the magnet that you can use to display different things.      The second part is the spot that allows you to hang the magnet anywhere!                       




I decided to make MagnaSpot when I purchased my new stainless steel refrigerator and realized that I couldn’t put magnets on it. As I was making MagnaSpot, I realized that they could work on other surfaces too. So, instead of having to use tape (which always seemed to rip or leave a sticky residue on my pictures/posters/walls) or push pins (that leave holes in walls and the items they are holding), I could just use MagnaSpots! With this realization, I knew it was a product that others could benefit from too!





1. 
Remove clear cellophane lining that is covering
the black suction side of the MagnaSpot
2. 
Press and Rub the black suction side of the MagnaSpot onto a smooth surface to activate the suction
3. 
Hang a note, etc. by attaching the magnets we provided
or hang your own magnet




1.  Remove any magnet, note, etc. that is on the MagnaSpot
2.  Peel the MagnaSpot off of the surface, like you would a sticker
3. Replace the clear liner to preserve the microscopic suction cells for future use


When you are finished with your MagnaSpot in one place, you can easily move it to another! 





MagnaSpots come in Red, White, Blue, and Yellow! Once the campaign ends, you will be able to choose which color you would like to receive. You can also get a mixed combination of the colors! 



MagnaSpots will work on most surfaces like:





Each MagnaSpot comes with a super-strong rare-earth magnet. These magnets are enclosed in a unique, clear, disc-shaped housing designed NOT to be a choking hazard for children and to make the magnets easy to separate. 


However, if you prefer a low-profile magnet without the housing, we have an add-on perk for that. Purchase one of the MagnaSpot options and the ""Low-Profile Magnet Add-On."" 







MagnaSpots have 5 layers 

One side is made of microscopic
suction cells to stick to virtually any surface without leaving behind residue.


The other side is
made of magnetic receptive material, making it perfect to use with magnets you
already have or the magnet that comes with each MagnaSpot.




Risks & Challenges
We have done a lot of research and made many prototypes. Our final design is ready. We have material suppliers lined up, so the Indiegogo funding will help us make the purchase of the materials to make the MagnaSpot and to make the magnet housing. We will also use the

<p>I was recently honored to be selected as an artist-in-residence at artEAST gallery in Issaquah, WA for July through September.

<p>Dear
problem bearer:</p>
<p>This
project was conceived as a tool to help you detach from what troubles you. The
main idea is to have fun, calm the fuck down, and look at life’s events from a
new perspective. You see, when life gets tough, the endless chatter inside our
minds just makes it worse. We go through the same thing, over and over, and in
the end we are so attached to our problems that we start to act as if we <i>are</i>
the problems. This is never true: we are not our problems, and none of our
problems is permanent. </p>
<p>By
acknowledging the transient nature of everything, we gain perspective. When we look at our
problems from a different angle, new ideas arise and we are able to see the
many ways in which we can accomplish a solution. Through these pages, you can place your problem in different scenarios, break
it into smaller pieces and realize that nothing is as unbearable as it may seem
at first glance. </p>
<p>By focusing
on the problem we stop avoiding what is bothering us (avoidance is another form
of attachment: by not acknowledging what troubles us, we are unable to let it go) and understand how it works, where it comes from, how it affects us and
how to truly let it go, either by finding a solution (whenever possible) or by
just letting it pass. It is sort of a meditation that involves your creativity
in many different ways: by thinking, drawing, sketching, coloring, mind mapping
and cursing when necessary. </p>
<p>The book
can be used for many different purposes: you can work on personal problems and
habits, emotional issues or work-related situations, money problems and
creative blocks. The only thing that you need to have is a problem. And we all
have them once in a while. </p>
<p>Use the
book however you want: go through each exercise for one problem, finish one and
go to bed, add color wherever you want, change the order, start from the middle or
the end, give it as a present… the options are endless. </p>

A través de estas páginas puedes poner tu situación en diferentes escenarios; dividirla en partes más pequeñas y darte cuenta de que nada es tan insoportable como parece. Te invito a concentrarte en el problema y no evitarlo (la negación es otra forma de apego). Aprende cómo funciona, de dónde viene, cómo te afecta y cómo puedes dejarlo ir. Es como una meditación que involucra tu creatividad de muchas formas: al pensar, colorear, dibujar, hacer mapas mentales y esquemas y quejarte y decir algunas malas palabras si es necesario.Puedes usar el libro de muchas maneras y para muchos propósitos: trabaja en tus hábitos y problemas emocionales; aborda situaciones de tu trabajo y dinero, o ponle fin a un bloqueo creativo. Lo único que necesitas tener es un problema y esos abundan para todos. Usa el libro como mejor te parezca: completa un ejercicio a la vez o termina una serie completa. Disfruta de colorear los mandalas para calmarte. Comienza en el principio o el final o dáselo como regalo a un amigo... las opciones son muchas. La mierda sucede, lo importante es no dejar que se acumule. About fundingThe money that we raise with this campaign will be used to cover for printing and design expenses, and to continue developing creative, mindful and slightly irreverent products.Sobre los fondosEl dinero recaudado con esta campaña se utilizará para cubrir los gastos de impresión y diseño y para seguir desarrollando productos atentos, creativos y un poco irreverentes. Take a look inside / Algunas imagenes del interior:",4.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>For
its participatory nature, the cone embodies the cultural identity of
the place where it is made and becomes the most immediate symbol of
<b>the community </b>that created it, which is recognised in a work able to
pass on its values to <b>future generations</b>.  Its monumental size make
it a point of contact between plastic art and architecture with the
objective of becoming a reference point, immediately inside the
territory – a centre of attraction able to draw the attention of
tourists and visitors, creating an inducement in terms of place of
work and wealth, like other works that characterise architecture and
contemporary art.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The
project is unique, an extraordinary event that can revitalize the
function of artistic experiment within civil society and lends itself
to becoming a model educational/didactic /creative, exportable to
other cities in Italy and abroad. <span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">Within the work accessible to
visitors there will unfold an exhibition space where there will be
evidence of the technical dimension and the communicative properties
of the sculpture: digital applications that will make the fruition of
the work extremely dynamic and the perceptual experience through
projections, sounds, explosions of light.  In this way the interior
of the cone becomes a real electronic connection destined to become a
kind of antenna receiving and transmitting information from each part
of the world and able to relate in real time, the visitors of the
other cones made on other sites on the planet.  In this way the
project welcomes and raises instances in the <b>Global Village Square</b>,
the experiment conceived by <b>Derrick de Kerckhove</b>, one of the world
experts in systems and technology for connected communication and
intelligence who oversaw the recent exhibitions of Piero
Fantastichini: a square for a Global Village through permanent video
interconnection between the cities of the world.</span></p>

<br/><ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Co-working art: A net of sculptures and workshops arounf the world</h3> <p>We set ourselves up on a very difficult task, but we believe that with the help of other people who will join our efforts we'll achieve our goal. We are constantly working to involve new subjects in our project, and we ask you to spread the word in order to get more attention to our cause. </p>
<p>This is just the first art work we are going to build with the help of an entire community: more projects are on the way, our dream is to build other sculptures around the world, sharing our vision with new communities worldwide. We called our project<b> co-working art</b>, we deeply believe that a<span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">rt has to reacquire  its role as avanguard outpost within a
community: the place where the citizens reactivate their creative
instincts and share an experience aimed at the construction of a
monumental work that will become the tangible symbol of an event that is
unprecedented in the history of recent art. </span></p>
<p>We believe children and art need to be reconnected, the practise of art is the key to break down cultural barriers and social differencies to unify knowledge, talents and experiences. </p>

<p>Piero
Fantastichini is one of the most visionary Italian artists. </p>

<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1459942671/0127_yeuz2l.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>In his long career he has always experimented new
materials and the latest technologies, combined with the influence of European
art in which he was trained. Born in the heart of Baroque Rome, he grows
eagerly studying the paintings of Italian masters and the shapes of the
Capitoline buildings. </p>
<p>He studied at the College of the Cistercians of
Casamari Friars. It's during this period that he began to paint and to compete
for the first time with the freehand drawing and collage techniques. From 1961
to 1967 he attended the Art School of Frosinone, where he is a student of
Maestro Piero Guccione. </p>
<p>After completing his studies, he starts traveling
in Europe between 1967 and 1969, and he gets in contact with the avant-garde
art in Amsterdam, London and Paris. He decides to devote his life to research
and artistic creation. In this period he works on a series of drawings and oil
paintings characterized by a personal touch signed by a detailed tract and
light backgrounds, consolidating a personal reinterpretation of classical and
baroque art. These works were exhibited for the first time in Fiuggi and then
to <i>Canaletto Gallery</i> in London. </p>
<p>In 1994 he holds a major solo exhibition at the
Schwarzenberg Palace in Prague, where he presented some monumental sculptures,
among which the <i>Horse of Piero</i> and <i>Iconi</i>, in addition to the
increased production of paintings of previous years including <i>The Christ</i>
and <i>The Battle</i>. </p>
<p>In 1995 he moves to the south of France,settling
down in a small village, Bonson, and then in Nice, where he opens his atelier.
In this period he begins digital experimentation, which leads him to explore
new territories of artistic expression and communication, earning the attention
of critics. In this period he meets the communication expert Derrick De Kerckhove
and he cooperates with Universities, research institutes and enterprises to develop
interactive works projects. He's invited to participate in festivals and media
art workshops.</p>
<p>In 2007 he realizes the scenography of Mozart's
Magic Flute, 800m2 of canvas designed at pc and then painted; the opera goes on
stage at the Grimaldi Forum in Montecarlo. </p>
<p>In 2008 He returns to Rome for a personal
exhibition at the National Museum of Castel Sant'Angelo, where he exhibits
paintings, sculptures, drawings and electronic interactive works. </p>
<p>The production of the last years is oriented to to
investigate the relations between art, technology and architecture, documented
by a series of exhibitions in Italy and abroad, and culminated in the works <i>The
Great Wall of Stars</i>, <i>Monument to chaos</i>, a <i>livable sculpture</i>,
and in the project <i>Source of light.</i></p>

</div></div>","The Project

The
artist Piero Fantastichini is
the creator of a project aimed at building a monumental art work built
with the support of children in elementary and middle schools. The
project consists of the construction of a cone of 40 feet, covered
with 2000 base-reliefs (16 cm x 16 cm). 




The
children, all residents from Fiuggi, an Italian town near Rome known for
its thermal waters, will create the outer layer of the Cone, working
on pigments, enamels and fiberglass. The Cone, once completed, will be displayed
permanently in Fiuggi. Kids coming from diverse cultural, ethnic and social environments will all have the opportunity to work together and be part of a team working toward the same goal: the construction of a monumental sculpture that will symbolize light and remain their own forever.  

The
project will be developed in two stages: we've already finished the
first one, which involved a workshop made up of 500 students from
primary and middle schools,
who already have created 500 bas-relieves. Each one will be placed on
the surface of the Cone. 


       

       
When these kids grow up, they will have the chance to share the experience of this accomplishment with their own children, and in that way spread the purest expression of the spirit of their community.

 



The
second stage is even more grand. It will involve all the citizens of
Fiuggi who wish to participate. My father will personally co-ordinate
the work of the entire Fiuggi community, who
will be tasked with the creation of the additional 1500 bas-relieves
that will form the skin of the Cone.  


 


The
Cone will be also equipped with an elaborate system of water pumps,
capable of pushing masses of recyclable water on top of the monument
and from there spill over the entire surface of the sculpture. The
water flow will create a music composition specially conceived for
the Cone.

The amount we set as our goal will help us to start with the second stage of the project and to complete the construction of the sculpture. We have to organize the next workshops where all the adults from the community will help the children to proceed with the building of the Cone. We need to purchase the materials: the steel structure, tons of resin and fiber glasses, colors and enamels, optical fibers to cover the inner ceiling, the hydraulic system that will activate the music, nad of course we need to cover the expenses of the labor to assemble all these elements together. 

The crowdfunding is a crucial stage of the process, it will help us to consolidate the budget we need to build the Cone and to help the children to accomplish their dream.

    The Impact on the community and children 
For
its participatory nature, the cone embodies the cultural identity of
the place where it is made and becomes the most immediate symbol of
the community that created it, which is recognised in a work able to
pass on its values to future generations.  Its monumental size make
it a point of contact between plastic art and architecture with the
objective of becoming a reference point, immediately inside the
territory – a centre of attraction able to draw the attention of
tourists and visitors, creating an inducement in terms of place of
work and wealth, like other works that characterise architecture and
contemporary art.

The
project is unique, an extraordinary event that can revitalize the
function of artistic experiment within civil society and lends itself
to becoming a model educational/didactic /creative, exportable to
other cities in Italy and abroad. Within the work accessible to
visitors there will unfold an exhibition space where there will be
evidence of the technical dimension and the communicative properties
of the sculpture: digital applications that will make the fruition of
the work extremely dynamic and the perceptual experience through
projections, sounds, explosions of light.  In this way the interior
of the cone becomes a real electronic connection destined to become a
kind of antenna receiving and transmitting information from each part
of the world and able to relate in real time, the visitors of the
other cones made on other sites on the planet.  In this way the
project welcomes and raises instances in the Global Village Square,
the experiment conceived by Derrick de Kerckhove, one of the world
experts in systems and technology for connected communication and
intelligence who oversaw the recent exhibitions of Piero
Fantastichini: a square for a Global Village through permanent video
interconnection between the cities of the world.


    Co-working art: A net of sculptures and workshops arounf the world We set ourselves up on a very difficult task, but we believe that with the help of other people who will join our efforts we'll achieve our goal. We are constantly working to involve new subjects in our project, and we ask you to spread the word in order to get more attention to our cause. 
This is just the first art work we are going to build with the help of an entire community: more projects are on the way, our dream is to build other sculptures around the world, sharing our vision with new communities worldwide. We called our project co-working art, we deeply believe that art has to reacquire  its role as avanguard outpost within a
community: the place where the citizens reactivate their creative
instincts and share an experience aimed at the construction of a
monumental work that will become the tangible symbol of an event that is
unprecedented in the history of recent art. 
We believe children and art need to be reconnected, the practise of art is the key to break down cultural barriers and social differencies to unify knowledge, talents and experiences. 

                      

The artist


Piero
Fantastichini is one of the most visionary Italian artists. 


In his long career he has always experimented new
materials and the latest technologies, combined with the influence of European
art in which he was trained. Born in the heart of Baroque Rome, he grows
eagerly studying the paintings of Italian masters and the shapes of the
Capitoline buildings. 
He studied at the College of the Cistercians of
Casamari Friars. It's during this period that he began to paint and to compete
for the first time with the freehand drawing and collage techniques. From 1961
to 1967 he attended the Art School of Frosinone, where he is a student of
Maestro Piero Guccione. 
After completing his studies, he starts traveling
in Europe between 1967 and 1969, and he gets in contact with the avant-garde
art in Amsterdam, London and Paris. He decides to devote his life to research
and artistic creation. In this period he works on a series of drawings and oil
paintings characterized by a personal touch signed by a detailed tract and
light backgrounds, consolidating a personal reinterpretation of classical and
baroque art. These works were exhibited for the first time in Fiuggi and then
to Canaletto Gallery in London. 
In 1994 he holds a major solo exhibition at the
Schwarzenberg Palace in Prague, where he presented some monumental sculptures,
among which the Horse of Piero and Iconi, in addition to the
increased production of paintings of previous years including The Christ
and The Battle. 
In 1995 he moves to the south of France,settling
down in a small village, Bonson, and then in Nice, where he opens his atelier.
In this period he begins digital experimentation, which leads him to explore
new territories of artistic expression and communication, earning the attention
of critics. In this period he meets the communication expert Derrick De Kerckhove
and he cooperates with Universities, research institutes and enterprises to develop
interactive works projects. He's invited to participate in festivals and media
art workshops.
In 2007 he realizes the scenography of Mozart's
Magic Flute, 800m2 of canvas designed at pc and then painted; the opera goes on
stage at the Grimaldi Forum in Montecarlo. 
In 2008 He returns to Rome for a personal
exhibition at the National Museum of Castel Sant'Angelo, where he exhibits
paintings, sculptures, drawings and electronic interactive works. 
The production of the last years is oriented to to
investigate the relations between art, technology and architecture, documented
by a series of exhibitions in Italy and abroad, and culminated in the works The
Great Wall of Stars, Monument to chaos, a livable sculpture,
and in the project Source of light.







    Other Ways You Can Help  If you can't contribute with donations to this campaign don't worry. We would really appreciate your help to  get the word out and make some noise about our project. We are looking for new cities and councils interested in activating workshops and building an art work (a Cone, a Pyramid, a Tower, any iconic symbol of the identity of the city) that would bring the community back together. 
You can use the Indiegogo tolls to share this campaign, or link it to your facebook profile or the other social media tools.

<h3>The Story<br/>
</h3> <p></p>
<p>The Runaways tells the story of James and Kellee - two
teenagers whose love for one another has carried them through the nightmares of
growing up in abusive households.  James is aging out of the group home and the
plan is for him and Kellee to run away together, but the night before they are
supposed to run away, Kellee finds her mother
beaten unconscious and begins to have second thoughts about leaving her.  What follows is a series of events that
leads to a decision that will change all of their lives forever. <br/></p>

</div><div> <p></p>
<p>Domestic abuse is something that affects everyone in some
shape or form. I’m sure you know at least one person who
has been a victim or abuser of domestic violence. I, too am
no exception to this. The irony about domestic violence is that people are
betrayed and hurt by those that they trust and love the most. I wanted to do
something different and focus on empowerment. I didn’t want to glorify
domestic violence without conveying strength. Because that is at the core of
domestic violence advocacy. </p>
<p>In The Runaways the bond
between James and Kellee is what allows them to carry on. These character
portrayals are important to see.<span>  Love in
the face of adversity.  Support despite
overwhelming odds. Personal sacrifice with a cost. We plan to take that idea
into The Runaways – to break the mainstream discourse and stereotypes that
sometimes follows victims of domestic violence. That they are weak, cowardly,
and deserving of their punishment.  We
understand that this subject matter is difficult, diverse, and
off-putting.  It is our hope to expand
the discussion about awareness of domestic violence with our film.  </span></p>

YOU are my sponsor. With your support, I have the freedom to lay the foundation for a successful business.  As Indiegogo supporters, you will have access to prints of my work, receive periodic updates and, most importantly, be an ESSENTIAL part of the creation of my business.MAKING OF MOTHER MOUNTAIN PHOTOGRAPHYThe biggest priority for me in growing my business is purchasing a new camera.  I've been making amazing images with iPhone cameras for years, and it's time to upgrade.  In order to get a quality camera and photo editing program, I am hoping to raise $2500.  You might notice though, that my goal is $8000.  The additional $5500 will go toward purchasing a tent and tables for vending, stocking up on frames, cards, and prints to exhibit and sell, and working with a top-notch marketing and branding company, Dream Inspired Design(DID).  DID will work closely with me over the span of 3-4 months to create a website home that welcomes visitors and helps me express and circulate my offerings. They will support me in synthesizing my vision, brand message and visual expression so that they are aligned and so my ideal customers and partner organizations are drawn to me. In an effort to give back to the beautiful mountains and valley I photograph, I will be giving 1% of each donation to Aspen Valley Land Trust, a local non profit working to permanently preserve open lands for agriculture, wildlife habitat, scenic enjoyment and recreation in the greater Roaring Fork and Colorado River valleys. I want to share with you my plan and vision:$2500Reaching this amount will allow me to purchase a professional camera and lens to take photos that I can turn into high quality, large prints.  The iPhone cameras I have been using for years, have allowed me to create beautiful images, but limit my printing size because of the low resolution.  A professional camera will open up so many doors for me in terms of image and print quality.  Additionally, if this amount is raised, I will be able to purchase Adobe Lightroom for editing my photos on my computer.$6500Hitting these numbers will pay for the camera, as described above, PLUS 4 months of one-on-one work with Dream Inspired Design to create a powerful website and brand expression.$8000This is my goal!  If I reach this level, I'll be able to have a solid foundation for creating my business with the camera, website, and branding described above, PLUS funds to purchase a tent & tables for vending, as well as materials for printing and framing my work.  How beautiful would that be?!******I hope you are feeling as excited and inspired about this as I am, I would really love to be able to bring my images and work to the world in the best way possible and to do that I need your help.THE REWARDSI hope you will take a moment to look over the sweet packages I have put together.magnetsmini printscardsframed prints1% of all contributions donated to Aspen Valley Land TrustI have 30 days to reach this $8000 goal, so I appreciate anything you can do to spread the word, whether it's reposting on FACEBOOK, creating a post on INSTAGRAM, sending an EMAIL to your friends and family, mentioning it in your BLOG, or telling a neighbor.

<li>There is a risk that I have done the math wrong, and I end up losing money on this endeavor.</li>

<p>Challenges:</p>
<ul>
<li>This is my first major crowdfunding endeavor, I'm not sure that I know what I'm doing.</li>
<li>Campaigns like this depend on promo and marketing to succeed, I suck at that.</li>
</ul>
<p>You'll notice that ""The book might not happen"" is not on the list of risks. That is because the majority of content that will be featured in the book is already completed work in my archive. That means that all that needs to be done in order for something to be able to go to print and be sent out to backers is for the images to be formatted correctly for the printers. Meaning, even if there is a risk of delay, there is no risk that fulfillment won't occur. In fact, any potential delays aren't at risk of being more than a few weeks - we aren't talking months here.</p>
<p>That stands, even if I end up realizing I have goofed the math and have to pay out of pocket for some of this. I'm learning here - but I won't be letting my supporters suffer because of that.</p>

This year we would like to continue the premise of a potentially peaceful co-existence between human kind and technology by adding a playfulness and whimsy to Chip and Terra that will have your heart instantly flutter with love.


While there are many challenges we face this year, our team has proven to make the seemingly impossible possible last year. Here are the major challenges we've already started tackling.

Fur LightingLighting the fur will require some methodical research into lighting options that will be bright enough to shine through the fur, tough enough to withstand the crowds and programmable to bring the fun! We've already found some extremely promising solutions, including programmable net and panel lighting.

Solar PowerThe playa can be unforgiving and we will have to be cognizant of the dust cover and sun exposure. We will have a maintenance crew on shifts to dust the panels and, if the sun cover is ineffective, turn on our backup generator.

Build Team and CrewThis year is an ""off"" year for a handful of our dedicated crew as they deal with their default world lives, so finding a crew able to take off the time needed to build, maintain and strike will be challenging but we've already begun adding to our family!




We know it's incredibly difficult to let go of your hard earned money, even if it gets ya a cool new necklace, so here are some other ways you may help us if you're psyched about our project but car insurance is a bigger priority.  Either way, we appreciate you and send good vibes your way!

<h3><strong>PROJECT DESCRIPTION</strong></h3>
<p>My name is Victoria-Idongesit Udondian. I am a multi-media artist from Nigeria and a non-alien immigrant living in New York City. I graduated with an MFA in Visual Arts from Columbia University in May 2016.</p>
<p>With the cold wind of intolerance, authoritarianism, and nationalism blowing across America and Europe, I feel compelled to respond to notions of border security and immigration. As a Nigerian artist, I am often frustrated trying to gain access to the world—which frequently involves going through a rigorous visa application process.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1500579517/vflnhjno6rxyymrsqdx1.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>“The Republic of Unknown Territory” is a multimedia installation/performance project that interrogates the nature of borders, immigration, and privilege by simulating and re-contextualizing the experience of obtaining a visa at a customs office.</p>
<p>In order to recreate the tedium and frustration of the process, “The Republic of Unknown Territory” requires patrons to fill out an adapted version of the Nigerian U.S. visa application form—with deeply intimate questions, ranging from one’s sexuality to income—in order to gain access to the art exhibit and the Republic. While performing as a customs officer, I will grant approvals according to my own subjective whims. This reversal of roles allows me to reconfigure the power dynamics of colonialism within the confines of the gallery space.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1500407805/xbustybhsutxqbotnrlu.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>“The Republic of Unknown Territory” also externalizes migration through absence: flooding the gallery is hundreds of disembodied shoes, floating hijabs, used clothes, spilling out of suitcases and sculptures of body parts. I will construct these “life casts” with the help of immigrant groups, alluding to the anonymity of countless migrants passing through countries to better their lives while also referencing the many refugees who do not survive the journey. Both the sculptures and stories (video and sound) become documents and artifacts of The Republic of Unknown Territory.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1500579553/ktde8ucw0zchz30uf3qm.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h3><strong>DEVELOPMENT</strong></h3>
<p>Currently, I am developing “The Republic of Unknown Territory” as a summer Artist in Residence at A.I.R. Gallery located on Governors Island, New York. During this time, I will expand on the project by inviting immigrants to share their stories with me. These stories and video documentation will be edited into video and sound installation.</p>
<p>This part of the project seeks to foreground the roles and positive contributions of immigrants to their adopted lands. At a time when immigrants are vilified and nationalistic biases increasingly divide developed nations, this project asks us to consider the global migration of refugees and questions the state of society without the contributions of immigrant populations.</p>
<p>Part of the collected stories (in process) will be on view on Governors Island from July 21st to August 5th. Opening reception will be held on July 29th. The final performance/ exhibition will take place in the fall of 2017.</p>
<h3><strong>WHY I NEED YOUR HELP</strong></h3>
</div><div>
<p>A.I.R. Gallery has generously provided free studio and exhibition space, but cannot offer a production budget. In order to realize this project, I need your help to raise <strong>$15,245</strong>. <span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'>The project budget includes:</span></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1500578830/so6l7if5qraex2wqjdup.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>All funds will be used to produce the exhibit, which can be broken down into three main elements: </p>
<ul>
<li>The performance</li>
<li>The disembodied sculptures and installation</li>
<li>The video and sound elements</li>
</ul>
<h3>CAMPAIGN</h3>
<p>By backing my Indiegogo campaign, you will make production of this exhibit possible. No amount is too small! If you can't contribute, <strong>please consider sharing this campaign on your social media networks</strong>. The more we get the word out, the more likely it is that I will actualize this important project. <strong>And by supporting me, you will become a citizen of The Republic of Unknown Territory with VIP access to the exhibit!</strong></p>
<h3>CONTEXT</h3>
<p>With the Trump Presidency and the recent travel ban on Muslim refugees and nationals, much outrage has been focused on how legal visa and green card holders are being denied access into the United States. But well before Trump’s ban, travel for many people around the world has involved extraordinary patience and determination while dealing with a cryptic and mystifying bureaucratic system.</p>
<p>By confronting viewers with an extensive and haphazard application process, American audiences will be able to experience the humiliating, illogical hurdles one must overcome to receive something as simple as a tourist visa to gain entry into the United States.</p>
<p>In the process of (some) patrons being denied entry, the American paradigm of “freedom of movement” is reversed. For many, this might be the first time they have ever applied for a visa and, through the exhibition, they will witness firsthand the extreme measures individuals must take to cross borders.</p>

<p>My name is Victoria-Idongesit Udondian. I am a multi-disciplinary artist from Nigeria and a non-alien immigrant living in New York. For the past 10 years, I have created work that questions notions of cultural identity and post-colonial positions in relation to my experiences.</p>
<p>I received a BA in Painting from the University of Uyo, Nigeria in 2004. In 2013, I won the Most Outstanding Production Award at the National Arts Competition in Lagos. In 2016, I received an MFA in Visual Arts from Columbia University.</p>

<p>""The Republic of Unknown Territory"" is an important project for me based on my immigration struggles as a Nigerian. I look forward to your support in creating this context where our collective stories can be shared while also questioning the notions of border control and immigration.

</div></div>","PROJECT DESCRIPTION
My name is Victoria-Idongesit Udondian. I am a multi-media artist from Nigeria and a non-alien immigrant living in New York City. I graduated with an MFA in Visual Arts from Columbia University in May 2016.
With the cold wind of intolerance, authoritarianism, and nationalism blowing across America and Europe, I feel compelled to respond to notions of border security and immigration. As a Nigerian artist, I am often frustrated trying to gain access to the world—which frequently involves going through a rigorous visa application process.

“The Republic of Unknown Territory” is a multimedia installation/performance project that interrogates the nature of borders, immigration, and privilege by simulating and re-contextualizing the experience of obtaining a visa at a customs office.
In order to recreate the tedium and frustration of the process, “The Republic of Unknown Territory” requires patrons to fill out an adapted version of the Nigerian U.S. visa application form—with deeply intimate questions, ranging from one’s sexuality to income—in order to gain access to the art exhibit and the Republic. While performing as a customs officer, I will grant approvals according to my own subjective whims. This reversal of roles allows me to reconfigure the power dynamics of colonialism within the confines of the gallery space.

“The Republic of Unknown Territory” also externalizes migration through absence: flooding the gallery is hundreds of disembodied shoes, floating hijabs, used clothes, spilling out of suitcases and sculptures of body parts. I will construct these “life casts” with the help of immigrant groups, alluding to the anonymity of countless migrants passing through countries to better their lives while also referencing the many refugees who do not survive the journey. Both the sculptures and stories (video and sound) become documents and artifacts of The Republic of Unknown Territory.

DEVELOPMENT
Currently, I am developing “The Republic of Unknown Territory” as a summer Artist in Residence at A.I.R. Gallery located on Governors Island, New York. During this time, I will expand on the project by inviting immigrants to share their stories with me. These stories and video documentation will be edited into video and sound installation.
This part of the project seeks to foreground the roles and positive contributions of immigrants to their adopted lands. At a time when immigrants are vilified and nationalistic biases increasingly divide developed nations, this project asks us to consider the global migration of refugees and questions the state of society without the contributions of immigrant populations.
Part of the collected stories (in process) will be on view on Governors Island from July 21st to August 5th. Opening reception will be held on July 29th. The final performance/ exhibition will take place in the fall of 2017.
WHY I NEED YOUR HELP

A.I.R. Gallery has generously provided free studio and exhibition space, but cannot offer a production budget. In order to realize this project, I need your help to raise $15,245. The project budget includes:

All funds will be used to produce the exhibit, which can be broken down into three main elements: 

The performance
The disembodied sculptures and installation
The video and sound elements

CAMPAIGN
By backing my Indiegogo campaign, you will make production of this exhibit possible. No amount is too small! If you can't contribute, please consider sharing this campaign on your social media networks. The more we get the word out, the more likely it is that I will actualize this important project. And by supporting me, you will become a citizen of The Republic of Unknown Territory with VIP access to the exhibit!
CONTEXT
With the Trump Presidency and the recent travel ban on Muslim refugees and nationals, much outrage has been focused on how legal visa and green card holders are being denied access into the United States. But well before Trump’s ban, travel for many people around the world has involved extraordinary patience and determination while dealing with a cryptic and mystifying bureaucratic system.
By confronting viewers with an extensive and haphazard application process, American audiences will be able to experience the humiliating, illogical hurdles one must overcome to receive something as simple as a tourist visa to gain entry into the United States.
In the process of (some) patrons being denied entry, the American paradigm of “freedom of movement” is reversed. For many, this might be the first time they have ever applied for a visa and, through the exhibition, they will witness firsthand the extreme measures individuals must take to cross borders.
ARTIST BIO

My name is Victoria-Idongesit Udondian. I am a multi-disciplinary artist from Nigeria and a non-alien immigrant living in New York. For the past 10 years, I have created work that questions notions of cultural identity and post-colonial positions in relation to my experiences.
I received a BA in Painting from the University of Uyo, Nigeria in 2004. In 2013, I won the Most Outstanding Production Award at the National Arts Competition in Lagos. In 2016, I received an MFA in Visual Arts from Columbia University.

My works have been exhibited internationally at the Fisher Landau Center for Art, New York; Historic Columbia Museum, South Carolina; Rush Arts Gallery, New York; Flux Art fair, New York; Judith Charles Gallery, New York; Art 14 London Art Fair, UK; Whitworth Art Gallery, University of Manchester, UK; and Centre for Contemporary Arts, Nigeria.

My artist residencies include: Skowhegan School of Painting & Sculpture; Fine Arts Work Center, Provincetown, MA; Villa Strauli, Winthethur, Switzerland; Islington Mill, Salford, Manchester; Fondazione di Venezia, Venice, Italy; Bag Factory Artist Studios, Johannesburg, South Africa.
""The Republic of Unknown Territory"" is an important project for me based on my immigration struggles as a Nigerian. I look forward to your support in creating this context where our collective stories can be shared while also questioning the notions of border control and immigration. You can follow me on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram, and visit my website to find out more about my work.

<h3 style=""color: #458ea1;"">Best Mural in Maine, right here in Hallowell.</h3>
<p>Let's be honest, Chris, our mural artist, is becoming a <i>hot commodity</i> in the art world, He is sought after to create murals in cities around Maine—and indeed he has two in the works destined for Washington D.C.  It's high time we got Chris to apply his art skills to tell our story for a mural here in our river city.  He's local after all.</p>
<p> </p>
<p style=""float: left;width: 230px;margin-right:20px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1550414504/j8kqw3dhao46fxgpmxz6.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>This project has been evolving for more than a year.  It started just as a chat between the two Chris's of the project.  Hallowell has a rich and important history in the evolution of our state of Maine.  Chris is painting this 950 square foot mural so we can celebrate our history and highlight our present and future townlie endeavors—including ships from the age of sail, famous Hallowell granite sculptures, early settlers, native peoples, LGBTQ community, sanctuary city, arts and music and more, more, more.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;color: #458ea1;""><strong>It's a simple equation...</strong></p>
<p>Chris Vallee has a wall.  Chris Cart has the mural brushes.  And we all wanted a mural to tell the Hallowell story.  Add it all up and the solution is simple.  Let's do a glorious mural. </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>Mural artists just can't resist the temptation of bare walls.</i> </p>
<p>Officially, both the city's <i>Historic Hallowell</i> and <i>Arts &amp; Cultural</i> committees have given enthusiastic letters of support, as well as <i>Vision Hallowell, </i>our new city's 501 (c)(3).  And the <i><strong>Maine Arts Commission </strong></i>awarded us a grant to help get the mural project started.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""><i>""Chris paints in the great mural tradition of Rivera, Benton and Mucha, Chris will be gracing our walls with a piece that people will come miles to see—destination mural.""</i></p>
<p>Check back here because Chris will be posting mural updates as the design progresses.  This is just a tiny sampling of the hundreds of drawings he is doing to design the mural and tell Hallowell's story.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1546090006/ijdsshbypaafwpch1s81.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<ul></ul>
<h3 style=""color: #458ea1;"">Help Make It Happen!</h3>
<p>To create the mural is months of work.  Chris, the painter one, is working now and will be over the winter for the planned unveiling of the mural in June 2019. </p>
<h3 style=""color: #458ea1;"">What your money pays for:</h3>
<ul style=""font-size: 12px;"">
<li>$480 - Rolls of 60 inch x 6 yards at $40/roll (needed approx. 12 rolls Polytab 20r #320)</li>
<li>$1700+ - Paint - Golden Acrylics (12 color palette in 32 oz tubs @ approx. $70-100 per tub)</li>
<li>$230- Brushes (wall brushes and detail--3 inch badger to ½ flats plus rollers)</li>
<li>$550 - Wall/mural adhesive and final varnish, (approximately 4 gallons of each)</li>
<li>$1700 - Rental of scaffolding or hydraulic boom “man lift” for final week mural installation (1300 per week + approx. 400 delivery and pickup.)</li>
<li>Approximately $900 for models for various poses in mural, and assistants for prep work and mural installation</li>
<li><strong>$6860 total for supplies, hired hands and equipment.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><i><strong>Plus 6 months work by the artist.</strong></i>  Murals are huge undertakings.  With your help here, grants and other sponsors we are hoping to raise at least $<strong>28,000 </strong>to buy supplies and to keep Chris working <i>to get this done by June 2019</i>.  Thanks for anything you can do.  If we can get 800 contributions of $35, we can get it done in true crowd funding classic form.  Tell a friend.  </p>
<h3 style=""color: #458ea1;"">Keep the artist Fed!</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1546091246/njsgikc1gtx55xworrz1.jpg"" src=""""/>Importantly your money will keep Chris painting <i>on our mural</i>—rather than working on someone else's project, if he needs to pay his bills this winter. <i><strong> </strong></i></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;color: #458ea1;""><i><strong>If we can keep him fed, he can keep painting on our mural! </strong></i></p>
<p>This is a pretty good mural deal for us in Hallowell.   So you can contribute here to keep him fed. <i> Wow, cool, kinda like an Art Zoo</i>.   <strong>Feed the Artist!</strong></p>
<h3 style=""color: #458ea1;"">What else is Happening</h3>
<p>Chris will be hosting a some open studio days for Hall-Dale and UMA art students to stop by and learn about mural processes and techniques.  Chris feels it is very important for experienced artists to pass on skills to the next generations—or else the skill get lost.</p>
<p>And he will have periodic open studio days for Hallowellians to see how the mural is progressing.</p>
<h3 style=""color: #458ea1;"">Some Mural Thank You Perks!</h3>
<p>When you contribute to help make this major art piece happen, we have lots of great perks by way of thank you's.</p>
<ul>
<li>$23 - a signed fine art thank you card. </li>
<li>$195 - a signed fine art giclée print of the final mural. Ready to frame.</li>
<li>Lots of cool hand painted shirts and hats...hand painted by Chris and Jen.</li>
<li>Chris will be offering many of the beautiful drawings and studies for the mural.  One of a kind original art.</li>
<li>Or for $1000 your name or business name can be included in the mural, </li>
<li>We are coming up with new perks all the time, so check back.</li>
</ul>
<h3 style=""color: #458ea1;"">How's it done?</h3>
<p>Murals are months of work.  Chris and Sam started research months ago, figuring out what parts of our history should be included.  Sam is finding tons of reference photos for Chris to work from.  </p>
<p>Chris develops a mural by doing hundreds of drawings of parts of the mural, individual figures as well as overall design ideas.  The idea develops in the sketch pad over months of refinement.</p>
<p>Next Chris starts figuring out the palette, the color and design by painting ""color studies"" of the mural parts.</p>
<p>After months, once the design is fully refined, Chris does a scale version of the mural, a small painting of the mural, finished in every detail.  This smaller version ensures that all the parts work together to produce a beautiful, cohesive whole.</p>
<p>Then Chris uses this scale version to enlarge it onto the full canvas.  This enlargement is sometimes done with the traditional grid enlargement method used by muralists for centuries.  </p>
<p>Then Chris jumps into the months of painting the actual mural canvas.  Months of work with large brushes, buckets of paint, scaffolding, ladders...lots of work.  Physically taxing work.</p>
<p>Then finally, when complete, the mural is installed on the wall.  We'll be documenting this entire process in a book, <i>T</i><i>he Making of a Mural, <i> </i></i>which is one of our fun donor perks.</p>

<h3 style=""color: #458ea1;"">Why a Mural?</h3>

Let's be honest, Chris, our mural artist, is becoming a hot commodity in the art world, He is sought after to create murals in cities around Maine—and indeed he has two in the works destined for Washington D.C.  It's high time we got Chris to apply his art skills to tell our story for a mural here in our river city.  He's local after all.
 

This project has been evolving for more than a year.  It started just as a chat between the two Chris's of the project.  Hallowell has a rich and important history in the evolution of our state of Maine.  Chris is painting this 950 square foot mural so we can celebrate our history and highlight our present and future townlie endeavors—including ships from the age of sail, famous Hallowell granite sculptures, early settlers, native peoples, LGBTQ community, sanctuary city, arts and music and more, more, more.
It's a simple equation...
Chris Vallee has a wall.  Chris Cart has the mural brushes.  And we all wanted a mural to tell the Hallowell story.  Add it all up and the solution is simple.  Let's do a glorious mural. 
Mural artists just can't resist the temptation of bare walls. 
Officially, both the city's Historic Hallowell and Arts & Cultural committees have given enthusiastic letters of support, as well as Vision Hallowell, our new city's 501 (c)(3).  And the Maine Arts Commission awarded us a grant to help get the mural project started.
""Chris paints in the great mural tradition of Rivera, Benton and Mucha, Chris will be gracing our walls with a piece that people will come miles to see—destination mural.""
Check back here because Chris will be posting mural updates as the design progresses.  This is just a tiny sampling of the hundreds of drawings he is doing to design the mural and tell Hallowell's story.


Help Make It Happen!
To create the mural is months of work.  Chris, the painter one, is working now and will be over the winter for the planned unveiling of the mural in June 2019. 
What your money pays for:

$480 - Rolls of 60 inch x 6 yards at $40/roll (needed approx. 12 rolls Polytab 20r #320)
$1700+ - Paint - Golden Acrylics (12 color palette in 32 oz tubs @ approx. $70-100 per tub)
$230- Brushes (wall brushes and detail--3 inch badger to ½ flats plus rollers)
$550 - Wall/mural adhesive and final varnish, (approximately 4 gallons of each)
$1700 - Rental of scaffolding or hydraulic boom “man lift” for final week mural installation (1300 per week + approx. 400 delivery and pickup.)
Approximately $900 for models for various poses in mural, and assistants for prep work and mural installation
$6860 total for supplies, hired hands and equipment.

Plus 6 months work by the artist.  Murals are huge undertakings.  With your help here, grants and other sponsors we are hoping to raise at least $28,000 to buy supplies and to keep Chris working to get this done by June 2019.  Thanks for anything you can do.  If we can get 800 contributions of $35, we can get it done in true crowd funding classic form.  Tell a friend.  
Keep the artist Fed!
Importantly your money will keep Chris painting on our mural—rather than working on someone else's project, if he needs to pay his bills this winter.  
If we can keep him fed, he can keep painting on our mural! 
This is a pretty good mural deal for us in Hallowell.   So you can contribute here to keep him fed.  Wow, cool, kinda like an Art Zoo.   Feed the Artist!
What else is Happening
Chris will be hosting a some open studio days for Hall-Dale and UMA art students to stop by and learn about mural processes and techniques.  Chris feels it is very important for experienced artists to pass on skills to the next generations—or else the skill get lost.
And he will have periodic open studio days for Hallowellians to see how the mural is progressing.
Some Mural Thank You Perks!
When you contribute to help make this major art piece happen, we have lots of great perks by way of thank you's.

$23 - a signed fine art thank you card. 
$195 - a signed fine art giclée print of the final mural. Ready to frame.
Lots of cool hand painted shirts and hats...hand painted by Chris and Jen.
Chris will be offering many of the beautiful drawings and studies for the mural.  One of a kind original art.
Or for $1000 your name or business name can be included in the mural, 
We are coming up with new perks all the time, so check back.

How's it done?
Murals are months of work.  Chris and Sam started research months ago, figuring out what parts of our history should be included.  Sam is finding tons of reference photos for Chris to work from.  
Chris develops a mural by doing hundreds of drawings of parts of the mural, individual figures as well as overall design ideas.  The idea develops in the sketch pad over months of refinement.
Next Chris starts figuring out the palette, the color and design by painting ""color studies"" of the mural parts.
After months, once the design is fully refined, Chris does a scale version of the mural, a small painting of the mural, finished in every detail.  This smaller version ensures that all the parts work together to produce a beautiful, cohesive whole.
Then Chris uses this scale version to enlarge it onto the full canvas.  This enlargement is sometimes done with the traditional grid enlargement method used by muralists for centuries.  
Then Chris jumps into the months of painting the actual mural canvas.  Months of work with large brushes, buckets of paint, scaffolding, ladders...lots of work.  Physically taxing work.
Then finally, when complete, the mural is installed on the wall.  We'll be documenting this entire process in a book, The Making of a Mural,  which is one of our fun donor perks.

Why a Mural?

""Why not?"" sayeth the artist.   Okay, for the rest of us..why?  Well, murals are beautiful, and stunning additions to city walls.  The murals in Philadelphia and LA are destinations.  They anchor neighborhoods and make a splash.  And Chris states emphatically, ""This mural will be spectacular!, bringing people from miles around.""  It will add value to our city, our quality of life, and our standing as a unique and wonderful place to be.  

Chris has painted public murals in many Maine cities. 

Augusta, Kennebec,  at the Capital Judicial Center, a major Percent for Art commission 
Brunswick, The Dance of Two Cultures mural commissioned by Brunswick Trinidad Sister City Assocaition.
Bath, Spirit of Bath, Commissioned by Main Street Bath, for the City of Bath.

Authenticity is impossible when we have complete control over what is shared and what remains unseen. The performance of the self becomes dominant over the authentic self, a curated fiction blends into truth. This act of performance is rarely questioned, as we consume each other’s media on social networks and thus contribute to a collective obscurity of reality.<br/><br/>In order to explore the idea of the artificial self, this work is manifested as a 3D modeled digital avatar named Orchid who stems from my own, corporeal presence. This avatar is entirely artificial but mimics the strategies we use in media, specifically social media, to perform a version of ourselves for the viewing pleasure of others. As a way of taking ownership over my complicity in this cycle, I have taken this performance to a more extreme extent: I have formed a new identity through which to perform. In conceiving of digital space as queer space, Orchid and I exist as two separate entities. Orchid’s persona is based on mine but is autonomous, even as it is under my authority in my role as the administrator, behind the screen. Under the handle @digitalqueer Orchid can communicate with the corporeal world from within their digital one.</p><h3 style=""margin-left:280px;""><strong>Orchid will be in residence on Instagam and appear in a web-based exhibition with superchambers</strong></h3><p> </p><h2 style=""text-align: center;""><u>...and wait there's more..........................</u></h2><p style=""margin-left:480px;""> </p><p style=""margin-left:480px;""><strong>a wiki of art tumblrs</strong></p><p style=""margin-left:40px;""> </p><p style=""margin-left:40px;""><strong>a new group exhibtion:<br/>Cyborgs: Trangressed Boundaries, Potent Fusions, and Dangerous Possibilities</strong></p><p style=""margin-left:40px;""><strong>!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</strong><br/> </p><p style=""margin-left:40px;text-align: center;"">we've spent the last two years putting on group shows and presenting internet based work to the world, and we're excited to launch exciting new work into the world in 2018. your contribution to this campaign will make help make it possible for these artists to be seen and compensate them for the vision they bring to the world.</p><h2 style=""margin-left:40px;text-align: center;"">even if you can't participate financially, plz share this widely and encourage others to help!</h2><p> </p><h2 style=""margin-left:40px;text-align: center;""><u>!!!!THANK YOU!!!!</u></h2><h2 style=""margin-left:40px;text-align: center;""><u>!!!!THANK YOU!!!!</u></h2><h2 style=""margin-left:40px;text-align: center;""><u>!!!!THANK YOU!!!!</u></h2><h2 style=""margin-left:40px;text-align: center;""><u>!!!!THANK YOU!!!!</u></h2><h2 style=""margin-left:40px;text-align: center;""><u>!!!!THANK YOU!!!!</u></h2><h2 style=""margin-left:40px;text-align: center;""><u>!!!!THANK YOU!!!!</u></h2></div>","hi, worldmy name isjah (b. justin alexander hager)justice (preferred name)

Recently most active in live performance Garrett’s networked practice spans online art, installation, performance and writing.We will be presenting a retrospective of Garrett's work in combination with his social media residency on the web, as well as launching a pop-up exhibition.superchambersa new web-based work by Kello Goellerin the words of the artist:'superchambers' ~~ really giant scrollable images in website format (or which I might print onto fuzzy tapestries) which explore queerness and mental health struggle thru endless iterative digiworld cut&paste; mirroring the overwhelming construction of the human world around us.Orchidnew work from Anneli Goellerin the words of the artist:There is a viscous fusion of truth and falsehood on the Internet; particularly concerning the way social media enables us to perform our identity. Authenticity is impossible when we have complete control over what is shared and what remains unseen. The performance of the self becomes dominant over the authentic self, a curated fiction blends into truth. This act of performance is rarely questioned, as we consume each other’s media on social networks and thus contribute to a collective obscurity of reality.In order to explore the idea of the artificial self, this work is manifested as a 3D modeled digital avatar named Orchid who stems from my own, corporeal presence. This avatar is entirely artificial but mimics the strategies we use in media, specifically social media, to perform a version of ourselves for the viewing pleasure of others. As a way of taking ownership over my complicity in this cycle, I have taken this performance to a more extreme extent: I have formed a new identity through which to perform. In conceiving of digital space as queer space, Orchid and I exist as two separate entities. Orchid’s persona is based on mine but is autonomous, even as it is under my authority in my role as the administrator, behind the screen. Under the handle @digitalqueer Orchid can communicate with the corporeal world from within their digital one.Orchid will be in residence on Instagam and appear in a web-based exhibition with superchambers ...and wait there's more.......................... a wiki of art tumblrs a new group exhibtion:Cyborgs: Trangressed Boundaries, Potent Fusions, and Dangerous Possibilities!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! we've spent the last two years putting on group shows and presenting internet based work to the world, and we're excited to launch exciting new work into the world in 2018. your contribution to this campaign will make help make it possible for these artists to be seen and compensate them for the vision they bring to the world.even if you can't participate financially, plz share this widely and encourage others to help! !!!!THANK YOU!!!!!!!!THANK YOU!!!!!!!!THANK YOU!!!!!!!!THANK YOU!!!!!!!!THANK YOU!!!!!!!!THANK YOU!!!!",12.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>About Sinister Creature Con</h3>
<p>""If you’ve ever found yourself marveling at the wonderfully terrifying creatures, demons and monsters in your favorite horror films, you can’t miss this event,” says Tim Meunier, Convention Founder &amp; Director.  “We’ve gathered some of the most talented and creative CG artists, special makeup effects artists and sculptors. Their unflinching attention to detail often goes underappreciated—but in truth, horror just wouldn’t be the same without their unique talents. That is exactly why we developed Sinister Creature Con—to celebrate those responsible for our best nightmares and pull them from behind the curtain into the spotlight.”</p>
<p>Sinister Creature Con is a bi-annual horror convention that provides an experience unlike any other. Each June and October we celebrate past and present—from the nostalgic to the contemporary—and have a little something for every horror artist and fan. Its purpose is to serve and promote the art as well as horror genre artists that have given us wonderfully terrifying creatures like Frankenstein, Freddie Krueger, The Shape, Chucky and Jigsaw. We invite you to come, be inspired, create and scare us.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<ul>
<li>We seek a minimum of 5K.  This is a base amount that will assist us upgrade our logistics.  </li>
<li>Our goal is to purchase our own in house PA, microphones, and projection for the Sinister Creature Con Film Festival, a brand new segment to be added to Sinister Creature Con Fall 2018 at no extra cost to patrons.  As producers of the Sacramento Horror Film Festival and The Love Horror Short Film Festival, we feel strongly about our ability to curate a quality program to our convention crowd. Presentation and exhibition quality is important to us and thus we need a helping hand in order to procure equipment.</li>
<li>Additional funding will be sought to defray the overwhelming costs producing an event such as Sinister Creature Con.  Defraying costs keep our ticketing costs for adults low and free for children under the age of 10.  In a world of inflated corporate convention pricing, we want to keep our show affordable to all.</li>
<li>Funds will also be allocated to assist bringing in the bigger genre celebrity names our patrons have been asking us to book since our inception.</li>
<li>Our perks are 2nd to none compared to other festivals looking for funding on Indiegogo.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<ul><li>In 3 years we have produced 5 successful horror conventions in Northern California.  Additionally, Love Horror Events brought the Rocky Horror Picture Show back to life in Sacramento and has entertained Sacramento over 12 years with the Sacramento Horror Film Festival.  On July 14th, we celebrate 5 years of The Love Horror Short Film Festival.  We have hosted Emmy Award Winners, Academy Award Winners, SAG Award Winners, and MTV Award Winners.  We have not only entertained Northern California for over 12 years but we have in turn created an inclusive, safe culture for all to participate in.  We are female centric, pro LGBTQ, and 100% believe in supporting artists of all walks of life.  </li></ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>We would love to be able to fund this effort in house with our own organic growth.  However, shows this size are expensive even on the base level.  Film patrons have been demanding a film festival since year one and their voices have been heard.  We wish to deliver.  However the cost involved with renting a full system is far from ideal.  Purchasing equipment in house will ensure we will not have to rely on 3rd parties and it will also ensure we will not have to raise ticket pricing in order to enhance the convention going experience.  We believe Sinister Creature Con is important to Northern California and keeping an affordable ticket price to patrons and their families is of paramount importance.</p>

<h3>Dream Come True</h3>
<p>My name is Sandra Beaulieu, I started drawing and riding horses when I was 7 years old. After twenty years of diligent practice in both areas I was inspired to combine them together! Art on Horseback was born!</p>
<p>Rovandio is a 17 year old Andalusian/Lipizzan gelding that I have known since he was born. He is truly a special horse, intelligent with a heart of gold. He has become a solid performance partner and the only horse I have ever painted from horseback. </p>

<h3>About me</h3>
<p>I am a visual artist with a background in science and more latterly, landscape oil painting. I am approaching the end of my sixth decade and want to step outside the comforts of my daily life, face new challenges and do something meaningful.  I am absolutely delighted to have been selected for this life-changing opportunity.</p>
<p>I have recently completed an MA in Fine Art at the University of Brighton and during my research there, I became aware of the impact that we are having on our natural world: the changes in the Arctic are being experienced more rapidly than anywhere else in the world. </p>
<p> I have visited Iceland twice and have a strong emotional response to the sublime icy and glaciated landscape there and this inspires my paintings.  My residency in Svalbard will allow me to spend a longer period of uninterrupted time in the Arctic region and will also enable me to make contact and collobarate with artists and scientists who are researching similar themes. </p>
<p>When I return I will make new work using my experiences which I will share with the public through exhibitions and also social media.  I paint in both waterbased media and oils and I also make innovative artwork using the natural processes of freezing and melting.  I hope to extend this work to include using meltwater from the glaciers during my time in Svalbard.</p>
<h3>What I am asking for</h3>
</div><div>
<p>I am looking for help with 50% of the total cost of the trip.  I have partially funded the trip through the sale of my art and now need to raise the balance to cover the remaining cost of the voyage together with flights, clothing suitable for the Arctic and art materials.</p>
<p>All supporters will receive a unique thank-you.  These can be seen in the perks section but will include postcards from the most northerly post office on the planet together with a special  Arctic image thank-you cards when I get back, Additionally I will be offering photographic images and unique pieces of art and paintings.  All the artwork offered is at a substantial discount as an expression of gratitude for helping me reach my goal.  Every single donation will count - aside from travel costs I will be putting donations towards the cost of woolly socks or underwear or a tube of mineral watercolour pigment and other art materials.  The first 10 people to donate will receive an extra thank-you suprise in the form of a unique piece of artwork from my existing collection. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The project is important to me in terms of allowing me to visit a remote and very special environment and I hope to use the experience to make work that communicates the unique beauty and fragility of the Arctic region.  In the current political environment it is more important than ever before that we recognise the facts of what is happening on our planet.  The Arctic plays a crucial part in global weather patterns generating ocean currents that act to cool the world.  The sea ice too acts as a mirror reflecting back rays from the sun.  The loss of sea ice that is happening now is an urgent signal that we are profoundly affecting the earth's systems.  I hope to interact with scientists during the voyage to deepen my understanding of climate change and hence develop my artwork further.  The Arctic Circle residency will be an important next step in my professional development as an artist and I hope that I will be able to use my experience and the artwork that I create to engage the public in a discussion about our impact on the environment. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>I am aware of two main risks to me personally.  Firstly I don't have good sea-legs and have never spent longer than a few hours at sea and secondly I'm not good in cold climates.   I plan to mitigate the cold with good Arctic clothing and have been advised by previous participants what to buy.  If we meet with extreme weather during the voyage I hope to remedy any sea-sicknes with acupuncture and have an acupuncturist friend who is going to teach me how to administer acupuncture myself.  I believe that my enthusiasm, excitement and joy of being in the Arctic landscape will play a large part too, in overcoming these challenges. </p>

As you enter the piece, you will be among the roots where an ambisonic sound space is brought to life with captivating performances and gatherings. A 90ft tall central light and sound atrium moves you through the heart of the tree. Ascending the atrium staircase, you are embraced by the vibrations and frequencies of the seven chakras through the ambisonic surround sound. At the top, you arrive in the Temple of the Stars, a place to spend time friends contemplating the wonders of Black Rock City. The Tree of Life is your home to feel into the interactive exchange between the earth and space, nature and technology, in which both the internal journey and external expression are brought together. We invite you to be part of the team by giving life to the Tree of Life. </p><p> </p><h3>BUILDING PROCESS</h3><p>We are building this art piece through sustainable and innovative practices to live in one of the most extreme environments on Earth at Burning Man. This piece demonstrates new levels of architectural possibility and communicates the priority of sustainability. The main structure is made of Glulam, a renewable building material sustainably harvested from the forest along with recycled steel, aluminum, and fabric. Computer modeling allows us to design for extreme environments while saving time, money and minimizing risk. The computer modeling process has given us the opportunity to test every single part of the design and save time in building by optimizing the process Connecting our digitals models directly with CNC robots cuts the Glulam pieces to the perfect size and specification needed.

As you enter the piece, you will be among the roots where an ambisonic sound space is brought to life with captivating performances and gatherings. A 90ft tall central light and sound atrium moves you through the heart of the tree. Ascending the atrium staircase, you are embraced by the vibrations and frequencies of the seven chakras through the ambisonic surround sound. At the top, you arrive in the Temple of the Stars, a place to spend time friends contemplating the wonders of Black Rock City. The Tree of Life is your home to feel into the interactive exchange between the earth and space, nature and technology, in which both the internal journey and external expression are brought together. We invite you to be part of the team by giving life to the Tree of Life.  BUILDING PROCESSWe are building this art piece through sustainable and innovative practices to live in one of the most extreme environments on Earth at Burning Man. This piece demonstrates new levels of architectural possibility and communicates the priority of sustainability. The main structure is made of Glulam, a renewable building material sustainably harvested from the forest along with recycled steel, aluminum, and fabric. Computer modeling allows us to design for extreme environments while saving time, money and minimizing risk. The computer modeling process has given us the opportunity to test every single part of the design and save time in building by optimizing the process Connecting our digitals models directly with CNC robots cuts the Glulam pieces to the perfect size and specification needed. Creating the steel connectors was an intellectually intensive process, that resulted in finding a design that allows us to optimize the installation process and reduce installation time. With our growing community we are crafting the sunrise and sunset faces that personify the Tree of Life and the fabric art that adorns the trunk and canopy. We invite you to participate and get involved in the process of creating! EXPERIENTIAL TECHNOLOGY  Highlighting the experiential technology is an ambisonic surround sound system and a lighting system that mirrors the movement of people and light patterns in nature. Within the Tree of Life the sound and light atrium experience can take human consciousness from linear to spherical. THE INSPIRATION & MESSAGEThe Tree of Life is inspired by and in tribute to the tragedy of the Columbia Gorge fire in Oregon, followed by the North Bay and Thomas fires in California.

<h3>About the Spa</h3>
<p><i>The Spa at Lake Lahontan</i> is a container for the breadth and depth of stories held within the Black Rock Desert -- stories of the earth, the people, the flora and fauna; of geological change and human impact. It's a place that contains mysteries and secrets and a place where time is elastic and cyclical. </p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Spa at Lake Lahontan (in Golden Guy Alley)</h3>
<p>This year, we're bringing a teaser of the Spa experience to Black Rock City as part of <a href=""http://goldenguyalley.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Golden Guy Alley</a> -- a magical neighborhood of micro bars and immersive experiences that fosters community and conversation modeled after the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shinjuku_Golden_Gai"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Golden Gai</a> district in the Shinjuku area of Tokyo. <i>The Spa</i> in its full glory needs time to germinate and evolve. So, we're taking a full year to develop the concept.  <strong>This campaign is for the 2019 Spa at Lake Lahontan experience in Golden Guy Alley. </strong></p>
<p><i>The Spa</i> is literally immersive. It's an old west style building that echoes the Gold and Silver Rush eras of California and Nevada. Signage invites you to “soak” in the (nonexistent) bathtubs, to take in the (imaginary) vistas, to ring reception bells and wait for a vanished concierge. Enjoy a cocktail or a special <i>Spa</i> elixir while submerging yourself in an aural and visual adventure of the Black Rock Desert. Photographs, paintings, and curios created by a variety of artists tell a story that traverses timelines of geology, human culture, industry, flora, and fauna. A layered soundscape envelops and disorients you with flowing water and rattling pipes; oral histories of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Lahontan"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Lake Lahontan</a> and the Western desert; sounds of the natural world; and musical delights. </p>
<p>During the day, partake in a variety of Spa ""treatments"" while in the evening, delight in micro performances and shenanigans courtesy of the owners of the establishment and visitors alike. Don't be surprised to find a tarot card reader teaching the samba to a wanted bank robber. Or a fiddle player and a a stilt walker waxing poetic over a refreshing <i>Lake Lahontan Gimlet</i>. </p>
<p>Be the first to get in on Spa reservations for 2020 using our special telephony device, or make a call to a long lost friend you never knew you had.  </p>
<p>Above all, we hope you find relaxation and solace -- with a side of slight discomfort and angst -- as you soak in a spa with no water: the Spa at Lake Lahontan (in Golden Guy Alley). </p>

<h2>What is the Talking Walls Mural Festival?</h2>
<p>TALKING WALLS strives to show the world in a highly visible way that Charlotte is a creative hub and a city that supports and welcomes artistic influencers. We hate beige, boring, and bland walls. We want to push the vibrancy of Charlotte through beautiful works of mural art.</p>
<p>Talking walls will:</p>
<ul>
<li>Curate 15+ new public outdoor murals in Charlotte, adding to the 18 murals we put up in 2018.</li>
<li>Engage 15+ local, national, and international artists</li>
<li>Program several days worth of family friendly art focused events &amp; night parties</li>
<li>Execute all of this over the course of one week in October (October 16th - 19th)</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h2> </h2>
<h2>What We Need </h2>
<p>Simply put, we need funding to pull off this festival. If you donate, this is where your dollars are going:</p>
<ul>
<li>We provide each artist a stipend for their time and energy</li>
<li>We provide all the paint for the artists</li>
<li>We provide all the hydraulic lifts and equipment for artists</li>
<li>We provide hotels, airfare, and travel accommodations for artists</li>
<li>We provide food and drinks for the artists while they are in town</li>
</ul>
<p><br/>In addition, the production costs to pull this off add up quickly: runners, transportation, photographers, videographers, creative design, signage, insurance, events, security, storage, etc.</p>
<p>The only area where your dollars don't go is to the leadership of Talking Walls. We are completely and 100% driven by a small group of community volunteers and we do not take $1 from this festival (in fact many of us donate our own money to help pull this thing off).</p>
</div><div>
<h2> </h2>
<h2>The Impact</h2>
<p>When the festival is complete Charlotte will be the home to 15+ highly visible and vibrant massive works of mural art. </p>
<ul>
<li>Our goal is to paint in as many new locations as possible each year to increase the total # of mural works Charlotte has to offer, thereby increasing the vibrancy of the city.</li>
<li>Murals are a great way to show the public that Charlotte is open for business and supports local art.</li>
<li>Murals raise the flag to other artists that Charlotte supports their arts community.</li>
<li>You are investing in your city, your landscape, your culture, and your community.</li>
<li>We are moving art out of the museums and into the streets. Free for all to enjoy for years to come!</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h2> </h2>
<h2>Risks &amp; Challenges</h2>
<p>The costs of the festival are around $80,000.</p>

<p>Parallel Self Embraced is an upcoming art installation for Burning Man 2021. Awarded an Honoraria for Burning Man 2020, the piece was postponed due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Work never stopped however, and now the piece is in need of some starter funds to begin the bulk material producing and manufacturing necessary to make the piece a reality.</p>
<h3>Piece Concept:</h3>
<p>In brief: We live in tumultuous and divided times. Our relationship to each other today is often one of disagreement, strife, and tribal mentality. Parallel Self Embraced presents an alternative - encouraging a coming together interpersonally. The piece forms a sort of abstract mirror. Identical on either side, participants step up to it and see the person across from them. Within an infinite number of universes, in an infinite number of timelines, all events are possible, and in infinity, within some space and some time, you are me and I am you. Parallel Self Embraced thus functions as a looking glass through which to see a partner, a friend, even just a stranger, as a reflection of the self that could be, and the beauty inherent to the person traveling in a world parallel to yourself.</p>
<p>Physical description: Twin 12' by 12' square panels made of welded pipe and metal bars stand parallel, a foot apart, with wooden stairs leading up to the center of each panel on either side. Lines of the structure radiate from the outside of the square inward toward human-shaped negative spaces. Parallel Self Embraced is an outdoor installation. By day the piece appears as an abstract dark metal sculpture with lines radiating out. By night, LED pixels along the radiating lines light up. When a person enters either of the human shaped negative spaces, they trip a variety of interdependent Arduino sensors (eg. proximity sensor, photoresistor tripwire, pressure sensor, etc.) that connect to the LED strands and audio processors. Discreet speakers provide a daytime interaction element and lie beneath the stairs of either side.</p>
<h3>Who We Are:</h3>
<p>I'm lead artist Matthew Pagoaga. I brought 'Cirrus - The musical weather robotic soloist' to Burning Man 2018. You might have met him! Cirrus sang over 5,000 songs a day at Burning Man 2018 based on live weather data for a given zip code. Our team for that work(and Parallel Self Embraced) is made up of members of theme camp, Shibumi (est. 2010.) If you've been in the 7:30 sector of Burning mans past, you might have had a cocktail at our bar, made use of our confession booth, heard our annual story time morning, or just gotten down to Wu-Tang Wednesday. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get:</h3>
<p>We're offering rewards for various levels of donation, but, in truth, need anything we can get:</p>
<ul>
<li>We need starter funds to begin the purchasing and manufacturing of the piece. This includes buying the LED, drivers, metal, and sensors for the project. </li>
<li>Any amount donated will support the construction of this piece.</li>
<li>Donators will be listed as contributors the piece and thanked in materials supporting the work, and on my personal website. </li>
<li>Stickers, pins, and pendants are also rewards for the various donation levels! </li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact:</h3>
<p>Parallel Self Embraced is situated to emerge from one of the strangest chapters of our modern history. We've conducted a fast of immediacy, intimacy, and connection in this pandemic. I believe we're going to reemerge communicating entirely different -- reevaluating our connections to each other both immediate and distanced. Parallel Self Embraced is thus able to serve as a meeting point for the 'after' of this drought, encouraging a coming together both physically and interpersonally. I believe it will be a valuable work, particularly in post pandemic placement.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges:</h3>
<p>No project is without risk. We don't know where this pandemic will go, and when we'll be free to emerge and embrace. That said, we are committed to bringing this piece to full reality in the aftermath of everything, whenever that may be. Your donation will feed a full size installation. Guaranteed.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help:</h3>
<p>We understand that these are difficult times. Excess funds to donate to art projects are often just not there. We're still soliciting collaborators and crew for the piece. If you have a valuable skillset that you think would aid this piece, we'd love to hear from you. You may be invited to join the crew and attend Burning Man 2021 with us!</p>

<p>Tottering Biped Theatre (TBT) is a full charity status organization founded in 2009 as a social justice inspired theatre company. Our performances have addressed poverty, Israeli-Palestinian relations, same sex marriage, violence against women, and mental health.</p>
<p>Since 2016, Tottering Biped Theatre has presented our original takes on Shakespeare at the beautiful Rock Gardens of the Royal Botanical Gardens. Our team descended on the Gardens each August to present the contemporary issues we care about with flair to the words of the immortal Bard, marrying the traditional with the issues of today to inspire reflection, new perspectives, and change.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the RBG has decided not to present our work again after 4 years of collaboration and despite having our largest audience yet in 2019. So we’re working to save 'Shakespeare at the Rock' and transform it into...'Shakespeare at the Castle' – Dundurn Castle in Hamilton, Ontario.</p>
<p>This change is exciting. This shift will radically improve our accessibility in 3 ways:</p>
<p>1. We have always wanted to offer ‘Pay-What-You-Can’ tickets, but the RBG dictated ticket prices, making this impossible. With Shakespeare at the Castle, we will finally be able to make all tickets ‘Pay-What-You-Can’ so that more people can get in and get their Shakespeare on!</p>
<p>2. We will also now be much closer to downtown Hamilton at a location that is much more accessible by public transportation, again allowing more people to enjoy our shows and receive the benefits of the arts.</p>
<p>3. We will also now have more artistic control over the work and be able to fully embrace our own social justice aesthetic while pursuing our goal of getting living wages into the hands of emerging professional artists in our area.</p>
<p>Tax donations over $200 can request donation receipts for income tax purposes. </p>
</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>If we can raise the money to pay our artists in advance this year, we can save the money we earn in ticket sales and put that towards next year’s budget. So, if we can get this money together <u>one time</u>, we will be able to sustainably carry on this project in subsequent seasons.</p>
<p>Our goal is to make this a legacy series for Hamilton and the surrounding region, and this is the <u>make or break year that will decide if that happens</u>.</p>
<p>Please consider contributing to this fantastic project!</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p><strong>Hamilton has little to no opportunities</strong> for paid work in Theatre. That means that all our emerging professionals move away in order to begin their careers. This is why our series is so vital - we are a key piece in changing that system and making a lifestyle for professional theatre artists in Hamilton possible, thereby also keeping invaluable arts experiences available to the community of this great city. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>One time fundraising, permanent impact. </strong>If we are able to raise this money, this year then all of this summer's ticket income will become next year's budget. It will all pay forward - and create sustainable income for this series moving ahead. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>We have been producing this work every summer since 2016.</strong> We have been attracting about 2000 people each summer with our work. We know how to do it. We just need this help to break into our own new space - and become a legacy for Hamilton Theatre!</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We need all the help we can get to spread word about this campaign and the show itself once it launches. Sharing this information and encouraging people to come is the best marketing that money can't even buy. Pushing this out there in whatever way you can will make all the difference to us.

TRXBE is social media app that connects people based on shared interests. We are focused on building an engaging product that users will love.</p><p>Over the past few years I have been thinking a lot about social media and how it is tearing at the fabric of civil society. Issues related to <u>abusive algorithms</u>, the proliferation of <u>fake news</u> and <u>conspiracy theories</u>, <u>hate speech</u>, <u>political divisiveness</u>, <u>thought bubbles</u>, <u>foreign interference in U.S elections</u>, <u>privacy concerns</u>, and <u>aggressive advertising</u> have become difficult to ignore. I believe that tech-companies such as Facebook and Twitter are largely responsible for the elevated discord that now permeates our digital-global-village. I think we need to do better.</p><h3> </h3><h3>TRXBE's Mission</h3><p>TRXBE's mission is to remediate the negative aspects of social media. As we build the TRXBE app, everything we do is viewed thru this lens.</p><h3> </h3><h3>About The TRXBE App</h3><p>On TRXBE, you create and maintain lists in categories such as your favorite movies, albums, books, bands, and television shows. Once you populates your lists, TRXBE functions like a social search engine. Show me people; age (25-35), gender (male), location (&lt;10 miles from 30303), that likes movies (Shawshank Redemption, Forrest Gump, Best In Show) AND bands (The Clash, Elvis Costello, Beastie Boys). TRXBE makes is possible for anyone, no matter who you are or where you go, to find your TRXBE.</p><h3> </h3><h3>How is TRXBE Different?</h3><p>The following are some ways that TRXBE differs from other social media apps:</p><p><strong>Our Business Model</strong> - We think social media was ruined when it tied its wagon to an advertising based business model. This caused social media companies to switch their focus from connecting individuals to connecting people with marketers - who want to sell us things or influence our opinions. TRXBE will pursue a different business model - one that enhances our user experience and does not provide tools to 3rd parties that they can use to weaponize our platform.</p><p><strong>No Business Accounts</strong> - TRXBE is for individuals and will not host business accounts.</p><p><strong>No Political Ads</strong> - TRXBE will not host political Ads.</p><p><strong>3rd Party Ads</strong> - The only 3rd party ads you see in your newsfeed are ones you opt-in to.</p><p><strong>The People You Need To Know</strong> - On TRXBE, you can only find and connect with people who share your interests. That is why we say, ""Facebook is for the people you know. TRXBE is for the people you need to know.""</p><h3> </h3><h3>Accomplishments Made To Date</h3><p><strong>Concept</strong> - The concept and business plan for TRXBE have been conceived and documented.</p><p><strong>Branding</strong> - We have created a visual identity for TRXBE.</p><p><strong>Design</strong> - We have designed the TRXBE app's screens, functions, and interactions.</p><p><strong>Functional Prototypes</strong> - We have created and revised numerous interactive prototypes. </p><p><strong>Visibility &amp; Marketing</strong> - TRXBE is building our audience by creating and distributing content via our website and old-school social media platforms.</p><ul>

TRXBE is social media app that connects people based on shared interests. We are focused on building an engaging product that users will love.Over the past few years I have been thinking a lot about social media and how it is tearing at the fabric of civil society. Issues related to abusive algorithms, the proliferation of fake news and conspiracy theories, hate speech, political divisiveness, thought bubbles, foreign interference in U.S elections, privacy concerns, and aggressive advertising have become difficult to ignore. I believe that tech-companies such as Facebook and Twitter are largely responsible for the elevated discord that now permeates our digital-global-village. I think we need to do better. TRXBE's MissionTRXBE's mission is to remediate the negative aspects of social media. As we build the TRXBE app, everything we do is viewed thru this lens. About The TRXBE AppOn TRXBE, you create and maintain lists in categories such as your favorite movies, albums, books, bands, and television shows. Once you populates your lists, TRXBE functions like a social search engine. Show me people; age (25-35), gender (male), location (<10 miles from 30303), that likes movies (Shawshank Redemption, Forrest Gump, Best In Show) AND bands (The Clash, Elvis Costello, Beastie Boys). TRXBE makes is possible for anyone, no matter who you are or where you go, to find your TRXBE. How is TRXBE Different?The following are some ways that TRXBE differs from other social media apps:Our Business Model - We think social media was ruined when it tied its wagon to an advertising based business model. This caused social media companies to switch their focus from connecting individuals to connecting people with marketers - who want to sell us things or influence our opinions. TRXBE will pursue a different business model - one that enhances our user experience and does not provide tools to 3rd parties that they can use to weaponize our platform.No Business Accounts - TRXBE is for individuals and will not host business accounts.No Political Ads - TRXBE will not host political Ads.3rd Party Ads - The only 3rd party ads you see in your newsfeed are ones you opt-in to.The People You Need To Know - On TRXBE, you can only find and connect with people who share your interests. That is why we say, ""Facebook is for the people you know. TRXBE is for the people you need to know."" Accomplishments Made To DateConcept - The concept and business plan for TRXBE have been conceived and documented.Branding - We have created a visual identity for TRXBE.Design - We have designed the TRXBE app's screens, functions, and interactions.Functional Prototypes - We have created and revised numerous interactive prototypes. Visibility & Marketing - TRXBE is building our audience by creating and distributing content via our website and old-school social media platforms.

<h3>ABOUT US</h3>
<p>At GlobalGeniuses, we are developing an innovative digital art manager that provides users in the art space with resources and tools to help them personally and independently manage and market their artwork and facilitate the exposure needed through various collaboration opportunities between artists' art collectors, art enthusiasts, and more.</p>
<p>GlobalGeniuses’ goal is to provide a space where artists can increase their opportunities through networking, actively sell or rent their artwork, and showcase their artwork globally through the platform’s designed Live Virtual Exhibition tool.</p>
<p><strong>The platform will provide a matchmaking feature </strong>that will enable users to connect with exactly the type of collaborators, tools, and resources they seek.</p>
<p><strong>The platform also seeks to engage, nurture, and empower emerging artists. </strong>GlobalGeniuses will also use its services to develop young talent, so Art becomes an option for a full-time career, not a path creative people have to put on hold due to the limited opportunities in the industry.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; Why</h3>
<p>In Phase 1 of Development, we are raising 7,000€ to build and market a Virtual Live Exhibition feature, where artists can show their work -- and art enthusiasts can view it from the comfort of their personal spaces.</p>
<p>By January 2022, we plan to have over 10,000 subscribed members, and by July 2023, we hope to have 400,000 subscribed members for artists, art enthusiasts, and art collectors!</p>
<h3>ABOUT THE FOUNDER</h3>
</div><div>
<p>GlobalGeniuses is the brainchild of Rangtiem Hoomkwap. She is a mother of two beautiful boys and an engineer with an undying passion for art and creativity. When she was younger, she reached a crossroads in her life. Go to music school and express her art, or go the traditional career route?</p>
<p>She reluctantly chose to follow a career in engineering and gave up on her dream of being an artist due to a lack of exposure, funding, and support in the art industries. Sadly, this is a common story amongst artists worldwide. Only a few manage to pursue art as their career.</p>
<p>New and veteran artists alike struggle with the same barriers such as high gallery commissions, insufficient/lack of connections in the art space, getting their artwork in front of a global audience, and struggle to market themselves to art collectors, businesses, or art enthusiasts.</p>
<p>This got her thinking...What if there was a platform that was intuitive, easy to use and focused solely on making genuine connections and collaborations between artists and those in the business of art? She was dreaming of a digital art management hub that helps manage artists careers efficiently, effectively, and creatively.</p>
<p>Fast forward to 2020… she took her big idea and figured out a way to do just that! With the platform’s innovative and unique matchmaking process, GlobalGeniuses connects you with users around the world. Resulting in career and business boosting collaborations.</p>

Ultimately, I am driven by my passion for community building and my love for dance. I left a stable career in architecture to pursue an endeavor I felt as would be most impactful. No regrets. Since 2001, I have worked relentlessly to serve my purpose in helping others bridge their dreams to reality by creating a virtual and physical platform of inspiration known globally as “Boogiezone!”<br/> </p><h2>BOOGIEZONE'S PASSIONATE JOURNEY SO FAR</h2><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1619822248/w7b2o4gcrd2ykut9l5cd.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>For many years we have struggled to operate our 14K sq. ft. building in old town Torrance, CA with little to no resources other than our love for the dance community, countless caring volunteers, and a ton of perseverance.</p><p>All that glitters, is not gold. Our 1920’s building is in poor condition and is in need of some massive repair.

<br/><strong>THE END IS ALSO THE BEGINNING</strong>
</h3><p>From January to March 2020 we experienced rapid growth, and transformed our struggling business into a wonderful system of teachers, staff, partners and students.

As you know - the entire world came to a grinding halt and so did all of the physical energy swirling around us. Just when we thought we were making progress, our new way of doing things was out the door. We were sad to see so many of our community friends who owned creative facilities and dance studios shut down one by one. We understood how this could happen and it has been gut wrenching to witness. Not even a fundraiser or a PPP loan could save us! The pandemic and the inevitable financial burden that would ensue would have been way too much for any business to bear, and for those who were logical and smart made the difficult decision to close and count their losses as a blessing. It was so challenging to see how the pandemic affected our community - we were at a crossroads. Should we fight to stay open once more? At what cost?</p><p>Today June 12, 2021, we have been physically shut down for over an entire year. We remain optimistic and grateful - our community is still here encouraging us!

We believe this will guide us towards finding the right investors or enable them to find us easier. We need assistance with building a marketing campaign that will help transmit and send our message to the world loud and clear.3. $5.75 Million: This will help us purchase the 23K sq. ft. building (of which we currently occupy 14K sq. ft.) and the 1-acre parcel of land (and parking lot) that our amazing building lives on.We are in a prime re-development area of old town Torrance situated in the South Bay of Los Angeles, and are so excited to help create a new vision for the city now that Toyota has relocated. We need more arts and opportunity to share it, and what more perfect place than exit 34!4. $11 Million: We have designed and created the most EPIC vision for the CENTER, and have only the best and brightest collaborators in a multitude of disciplines already on board to help bring this dream to fruition.

My dream has been to become a professional art photographer. Now, I am coming to the end of my MA in photography at Westminster University and I want to launch myself. This is my first solo exhibition, my first opportunity to bring my art to public attention beyond the university. I need your help to make this a reality. I need your helping hand to reach out to an audience so that I can begin to establish myself in the identity that has always called to me.</p> </div> <div> <h3>What I need</h3> <p>Photographic exhibitions do not come cheap. The biggest cost is the venue. Doomed Gallery offers great value for money, but even so half of the budget is needed for the space and for refreshments at the opening. Next comes the printing and mounting of the photographs; and the creation of publicity materials and a limited print run of a beautiful catalogue of the mask pictures.</p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>The photographic projects</h3> <p>The question of identity spans central concerns from understanding our own nature to gaining insights into the malleability of social identity. </p>
<p><b><i>Unplaced</i></b></p>
<p>One series of pictures, <i>Unplaced</i>, is a meditation on how one's identity is not fixed for all time but twists and turns over the years of a lifetime. We look for a place inside ourselves that is our true identity, but it seems always to elude us.</p>
<p><b><i>Unfaced</i></b></p>
<p>The other series, <i>Unfaced</i>, is an analysis of the power of masks to animate a borrowed identity. We are who we are, but we can also be somebody else for a while, and masks possess an uncanny power to bring to life a character, or an aspect of the environment, or a condition of nature. </p>
<p></p>

</div></div>","Why I am doing this I have been taking pictures almost all my life, ever since my mother put a camera in my hands when I was a young child. My dream has been to become a professional art photographer. Now, I am coming to the end of my MA in photography at Westminster University and I want to launch myself. This is my first solo exhibition, my first opportunity to bring my art to public attention beyond the university. I need your help to make this a reality. I need your helping hand to reach out to an audience so that I can begin to establish myself in the identity that has always called to me.   What I need Photographic exhibitions do not come cheap. The biggest cost is the venue. Doomed Gallery offers great value for money, but even so half of the budget is needed for the space and for refreshments at the opening. Next comes the printing and mounting of the photographs; and the creation of publicity materials and a limited print run of a beautiful catalogue of the mask pictures.
    The photographic projects The question of identity spans central concerns from understanding our own nature to gaining insights into the malleability of social identity. 
Unplaced
One series of pictures, Unplaced, is a meditation on how one's identity is not fixed for all time but twists and turns over the years of a lifetime. We look for a place inside ourselves that is our true identity, but it seems always to elude us.
Unfaced
The other series, Unfaced, is an analysis of the power of masks to animate a borrowed identity. We are who we are, but we can also be somebody else for a while, and masks possess an uncanny power to bring to life a character, or an aspect of the environment, or a condition of nature. 

The opening show
The private view will take place on the 8th of September at the Doomed Gallery, (Dalston, London, UK).

response to Eastern and Central European migrations and their implications for
cultural policy, particularly in cities.</p>
<p>Through this
intervention we seek to transform the exhibition space <i>The Glass Box</i> into an intersection of East and West, where the
audience can experience and engage with the realities (both current and

of a huge East-West demographic coming together will certainly remain, if not

as a platform for one-off events, discussion groups, film screenings as well as
an open forum. Our open call for film created in collaboration with <i>Kalejdoskop East-West</i> has received over
80 international video submissions. The selected 15 will be screened on 27th

<h3>Why Coventry? <br/>
</h3> <p></p>
<p>The
migrational influx of communities from Eastern and Central Europe into the city
of Coventry requires cultural representation, along with mechanisms allowing
for integration with other local communities which already exist within a city
that understands itself through its cultural diversity. This two-week project
will act as a vehicle for dialogue and networking across all cultures on the
subject of the reality of cultural diversity, breaking through the apathy and
scepticism following the political decline of ‘multiculturalism’. Communication
between the East and West will take on many different strands encapsulating all
areas of society. Within current political affairs it has become important to
reflect on the connections and support mechanisms between countries and cultures
across Europe. But there remains a huge amount of confusion and a lack of
strategic action on the part of cultural and civil society actors. Who is doing
what? Is it enough, and what could we do given the fragmented and embattled
state of contemporary Europe?</p>

<p>Pawel Hajncel is one
of the most radical, subversive and uncompromising artists in Poland. His
public interventions were often the cause of national debates, as well as
debates on social media. In his performances he comments on political,
religious and social affairs.  During his performance in Coventry titled <i>Patriotism for sale, </i>he will respond to
the attitude of Poles working and living in the UK. </p>

<br/><p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>With the rise in the numbers of Eastern European artists living and practising in the City, the region and across England, it is important that they are represented and that a public cognisance of that representation will be experienced in an open, creative and non-threatening way. This will allow for frank exchange and for the younger generation to consider a future of cultural possibilities through cultural exchange, interconnection and cultural relations. How can we work together and combine resources? How can Eastern European artists serve to increase our knowledge and understanding of contemporary culture across the Continent? The positive assertion of difference will change the self-understanding and portrayal of such communities in the city.<br/></p>
<p><strong> </strong><strong style=""background-color: initial;"">Through the project we aim to:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Attract a range of audiences in order to release migrant artistic communities from a sense of segregation.</li>
<li>Challenge national cultural policy frameworks through an artistic intervention of cultural diversity in a European context.</li>
<li>Engage artists, students and local communities, with a new dialogue between Eastern and Western Europe, using contemporary issues, concepts and thinking.</li>
<li>Promote the expression of cultural diversity (2005 UNESCO Convention) in a post-multicultural political discourse of culture, and do so through creative, experimental and transnational practice.</li>

<p>We need your help to get this gigantic project off the ground! All funds raised will go directly towards the expenses associated with this project. Conservatively, we estimate <b>$5,000 in costs </b>including: </p>
<ul>
<li><p><b>Travel and Lodging</b>: We will be filming in the Greater Baltimore and Philadelphia regions over the course of the next 2 months, and will need to pay for things like van rentals, gas, motel rooms, and bus tickets.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Costume and Props</b>: A crucial part of our vision of the world of our film.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Fringe Fees</b>: Registration, Insurance, ect. </p></li>
<li><p><b>Publicity</b>: Promotional print materials like postcards and posters, as well as compensation for the artists who design them.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Artists' Fees</b>: We believe in fairly compensating the people who make our art; the work of our ensemble, our featured collaborators, and to those who provide administrative and logistical support. </p></li>
<li><p><b>Space Rental</b>: From our Fringe venue to the spaces we shoot in. </p></li>
<li><p><b>Equipment Rental</b>: We’ll need fancy stuff like contact microphones, soundboards, lighting, and speakers.</p></li>
</ul>
<div></div>Any amount of money or attention you could give to this campaign would go towards helping us continue to develop ways of making and promoting bold, recklessly innovative art; art that builds communities and challenges tradition; art with an aesthetic that is strengthened with every new collaboration; art that addresses the changing landscape of producing live performance</div><div><br/></div><div><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;font-size: 24px;font-weight: bold;line-height: 30px;background-color: initial;"">Why You Should Give </span></div><div>
<span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">We are an ongoing experiment in collaboration, guided by our open-studio devising process. We believe how we make is just as important as what we make, and the best way to answer a question is with as many voices as possible. At the start of each new project, we have a series of open-studio rehearsals, where we work with artists across all disciplines to generate content that informs our final product, and ensures that each new phase of our work has a new flux of ideas through which to draw inspiration. These artists are then invested in our work in a meaningful, concrete way, and reach out to their networks to tell others about their experience, creating an interactive loop with our audiences that provokes involvement and excitement. We’re unaware of any other group utilizing a model quite like this to make their work, and we believe it has the potential to change the way art is made, seen, and supported.</span>

We have been making together since our founding in 2014 as a part of Emma Arrick’s Artist Residency at BRAT Productions, and have a vibrant, diverse, prolific portfolio to show for it: we’ve taken 15 live performances to over 30 venues in Philadelphia and New York. Showings of our work have been classified as immersive experience, dance theatre, long distant spectacle performance, installed public performance, mobile installation, staged poetry, performance art, and our favorite: interdisciplinary noise musical. 



We’ve worked through 4 phases of Plant Me Here, each with wildly different content, forms, audiences, guest artists, and missions. For our 5th and most ambitious phase yet, we’re travelling throughout the Mid-Atlantic to shoot The House at the End of the World, a silent film live scored by our ensemble that will premiere in the 2016 Philadelphia Fringe Festival at Cinemug Cafe.  

 The film, curated and directed by Emma Arrick, features Susanne Collins, Gracie Martin, Tess Kunik, Tory Trama and Dan Rosen. Generated collaboratively by our ensemble, in concert with an original collection of poetry by Jason Rosenberg, it will feature cinematography by ensemble members Tess, Emma, and Dan and longtime collaborator Robert Curry of Zimbo films.
  
Where YOU Come In! 
We need your help to get this gigantic project off the ground! All funds raised will go directly towards the expenses associated with this project. Conservatively, we estimate $5,000 in costs including: 

Travel and Lodging: We will be filming in the Greater Baltimore and Philadelphia regions over the course of the next 2 months, and will need to pay for things like van rentals, gas, motel rooms, and bus tickets.
Costume and Props: A crucial part of our vision of the world of our film.
Fringe Fees: Registration, Insurance, ect. 
Publicity: Promotional print materials like postcards and posters, as well as compensation for the artists who design them.
Artists' Fees: We believe in fairly compensating the people who make our art; the work of our ensemble, our featured collaborators, and to those who provide administrative and logistical support. 
Space Rental: From our Fringe venue to the spaces we shoot in. 
Equipment Rental: We’ll need fancy stuff like contact microphones, soundboards, lighting, and speakers.

Any amount of money or attention you could give to this campaign would go towards helping us continue to develop ways of making and promoting bold, recklessly innovative art; art that builds communities and challenges tradition; art with an aesthetic that is strengthened with every new collaboration; art that addresses the changing landscape of producing live performanceWhy You Should Give 
We are an ongoing experiment in collaboration, guided by our open-studio devising process. We believe how we make is just as important as what we make, and the best way to answer a question is with as many voices as possible. At the start of each new project, we have a series of open-studio rehearsals, where we work with artists across all disciplines to generate content that informs our final product, and ensures that each new phase of our work has a new flux of ideas through which to draw inspiration. These artists are then invested in our work in a meaningful, concrete way, and reach out to their networks to tell others about their experience, creating an interactive loop with our audiences that provokes involvement and excitement. We’re unaware of any other group utilizing a model quite like this to make their work, and we believe it has the potential to change the way art is made, seen, and supported.

<h3>Who we are</h3>
<p>Max and Rubi, the team behind Ursus Fine Art, have traveled the world and now make their home in Spain. Working from photos—his own, and Rubi's—Max creates wonderfully detailed images in pen and ink and watercolor. In addition to city views and landscapes, our favorite subjects include nature and wildlife. We also enjoy doing commissions, such as ""house portraits"" of the places you call home.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Where will the money go?</h3>
<p>The funds that we raise will meet our needs in these categories:</p>
<p><strong><i>Moving expenses</i>  </strong>   We need to move Ursus Fine Art into a studio in the Madrid area. These funds will go toward realtor fees, a security deposit for the space, and moving truck rental.</p>
<p><i><strong>Transitional operating expenses</strong></i>     In order to focus on creating more work and growing the business, we would like to raise three months' operating expenses—the resulting peace of mind will permit us to really stretch ourselves.</p>
<p><strong><i>Studio furnishings</i></strong>     We'll be setting up the new studio with easy to clean work surfaces and dedicated storage solutions—but nothing fancy here! (Think ""big blue box"" store.)</p>
<p><i><strong>Equipment</strong></i>     We need to upgrade our camera equipment to professional level; we'd also like to purchase our own printer—one that uses archival inks and accepts a wider variety of media. (Currently, we create our prints through an outside vendor.) Being able to print in the studio will mean lower costs and greater creativity for us.</p>
<p><strong><i>Supplies</i></strong>     An art studio like Ursus goes through a lot of material—paper, paint, pens... We would like to have a comfortable level of supplies on hand as we grow.</p>
<p><i><strong>Extras</strong></i>     Any additional money raised will go toward travel to wonderful places near and far. Naturally, we'll share our discoveries with you.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Your contribution, no matter the amount, moves us closer to our goal of creating a viable art business and making our dreams a reality.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>It won't be easy to make our way in the art world, and at the same time, we feel strongly that the world needs more artists and dreamers. The Ursus Fine Art team is made up of equal parts creative vision (Max) and real-world sales and marketing savvy (Rubi)—we believe that is a winning combination.</p>

<h3>About this Project: </h3>
<p> </p>
<p>My name is Kirsten, and I love to create. I fell in love with ceramics in high school and continued studying it at Utah State along with Environmental Studies. In the years since I have graduated I have run around in different ski shops, offices, classrooms, and gardens, but I have always felt complete and grounded when I return to studio spaces that smell like clay. </p>
<p>I decided to do this campaign as a way to challenge myself. I wanted to create a goal that felt just out of my reach, but something I know I can put my head down and achieve. I have had countless friends, family, and strangers express how much they would love for me to create something for them, and I in turn would love to undergo that process, but too often we seem to never get around to actually making it happen. With this campaign comes accountability from both parties and the drive to create beautiful things for beautiful people.  ​</p>

<h3> What You Get:</h3>
<p>A wise woman once told me that commissions were the best way to get moving in the studio. My goal of raising 3,000 in commissions in one week will help offer me allowance to continue working freely in my studio throughout the summer and take significant steps towards walking though life as a potter.</p>
