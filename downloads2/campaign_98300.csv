<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-size: 12px;"">TCB medical is proud to introduce a new epinephrine auto-injector designed for emergency administration of epinephrine in patients who experience severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis).  Most epinephrine injectors are bulky pen shaped devices that are awkward to carry, and consequently, most patients do not carry them. Our device was designed by an allergist to be a small, portable device that attaches to a keychain.  The device goes everywhere your keys go, and is more likely to be available for emergency use when the need arises. The size of the device significantly reduces the burden of carrying epinephrine, and the revolutionary concept of attaching the device to a keychain facilitates access to the device. </span></p>

</div>
<div>
<p>Our current prototype was produced by a process known as stereolythography. This process produces a material that is relatively soft and is useful for prototypes, but not finished products. We need funding to create the necessary machinery to produce hard plastic devices for production and for the FDA approval process.  Once we receive approval and you have supplied us with a prescription from your doctor, you can receive devices based on your pledge.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The success of our device will mean that allergy sufferers everywhere can have easy access to life saving epinephrine.  Most allergy patients do not carry the currently available devices (EPIPEN being the most common).  Our device can change that.</p>

<h3>What's the deal with shipping?</h3>
<p></p>
<p>With shipping, there are a few different options to choose from:</p>
<p><b>OPTION 1</b> - Pledge once for your VEXA500 of choice and include shipping costs in your initial contribution. Click the VEXA500 perk in the color of your choice. On the next page, add an additional gift and click ""Custom"" to enter your shipping cost. It’s that easy! For shipping to the U.S.*, add an additional $199 and for Canada, add an additional $229 (*Unfortunately, the VEXA500 cannot be shipped to Alaska or Hawaii). </p>
<p><b>OPTION 2</b> - If you’ve already pledged to get your VEXA500 and forgot to add shipping, no worries! Simply back the project again and select the shipping perk for either the U.S. or Canada!</p>

What's the deal with shipping?

With shipping, there are a few different options to choose from:
OPTION 1 - Pledge once for your VEXA500 of choice and include shipping costs in your initial contribution. Click the VEXA500 perk in the color of your choice. On the next page, add an additional gift and click ""Custom"" to enter your shipping cost. It’s that easy! For shipping to the U.S.*, add an additional $199 and for Canada, add an additional $229 (*Unfortunately, the VEXA500 cannot be shipped to Alaska or Hawaii). 
OPTION 2 - If you’ve already pledged to get your VEXA500 and forgot to add shipping, no worries! Simply back the project again and select the shipping perk for either the U.S. or Canada!
OPTION 3 - If you happen to be in the area, you can always pick up your VEXA500 from the VEXA500 team’s Hawthorne facility in California.

<p> </p> <p>It all started back in 2012 when me and Pawel came up with and started working on this project, at first it was a chain of fails, but we didn't give up...  it took almost a year to apply corrections and almost another year to create final version the liquid capable of working correctly inside this high pressure engine.

<p>On the 3rd of August 2015 the prototype was finally ready, it worked for 9 seconds, it stayed 2 meters above ground, caring weight of 1 KG, for 9 long seconds and... crashed (breaking also the garage door). 9 long seconds, before it broke.

<br/>How does it work?<br/>Long story - short: The liquid inside opposite rotating wheels produces centrifugal energy, proper distribution of liquid’s mass causes the device to maintain a constant directional pull. The most of the success lies in the liquid’s formula (patent pending), the viscosity, weight, magnetic properties etc. are a result of endless calculations, experiments and tests.<p> </p>

</div></div>","Good day!My name is Jacek, I’m most thankful for visiting our Indiegogo campaign. Not interested in drones? Please support our project with 1$, thank you! LGE stands for Liquid Gravity Engine.  

 Do you like drones? Well we’ve got news for you. LGE takes drones flying to all new level of fun. 
 The engine is installed inside a waterproof body, there are no moving parts or propellers on the outside. It’s a flying waterproof sphere, not affected by wind* or any kind of weather, fly it in air and feel free to dive underwater* anytime.
 There’s a camera eye and connectors on the bottom, beside this… the body is solid, you can paint it or dress it. You can be piloting a disco-ball, a death star, a gigantic eyeball…. Whatever you’re in to. Oh and another thing, flying propeller drones is fun, but flying an LGE is a completely new thing, it’s more like commanding an object to move around space, rather than fighting air to keep up.* Details in specification. 
LGE Drone 1: First drone using LGE engine. Sphere shape, no outside propellers or moving parts.All weather proof / not affected by wind (up to 6 points bs). Waterproof /can dive up to 1,8 m (5 ft). Bump-proof soft leather-like coating. 

Drone equipment: 
Live streaming video quality: 720pLevitate / flight time: 30 - 40 minutesMax speed: 60 km/h (37 mph)Max altitude: 122 m as per FAA regulation, user adjustable (400 ft)Communication: Secure WiFi network, 2.4 GHzWeight: 1,5 Kg (3.3 lbs) (With dock weight included). Dimensions: Diam 25 cm (10 inch)Battery charge time: 50 - 65 minutes (6000 mAh version)Control app requirements: iOS 8.0 or later / Android 4.3 or laterDrone equipment:- 1 wide angle camera unit 720p- Ultra-white LED torch- Bottom docking bay with 2 radio sensorsAlso in package:- Dock with radio sensors- AC Dock charger 110 / 230 V- Receiver (no internal storage / SD card expandable)- AC Receiver charger 110 / 230 V- Control unit with micro USB mobile phone connector- Software (Flashdrive or provided download link) + instruction

Before you ask…- The length of stored recording depends on SD card capability and video settings- The drone is water / all-weather / wind (up to 6 points) proof- The dock and charger are not waterproof- This drone can operate in temperature: from -15 to 45 deg. Celsius / from 5 to 113 deg. Fahrenheit.- In case of air temperature below -5 C / 23 F docking / charging should take place in place with higher temperature- In case of air temperature above 30 C /  86 F the dock should be placed / charging take place in shadowed area.- Drone equipped with a 1/4 inch screw mount bay.*- Drone is capable of lifting external weight of 0,8 KG (1.7 lbs)** In case equipment is installed through mount bay, auto-docking and manual docking is unavailable.
LGE Security Drone description:Security drone equipped with 3 wide angle cameras (night vision included) and one bottom torch (24 super-white LED).The drone can be programmed to fly around property (follow programmed path) and stream live video to receiver, once batteries reach 15%, drone automatically returns to dock to charge up. Once battery recharges, drone resumes to follow programmed path. Drone can be programmed to  automatically start programmed patrol on particular weekdays and hours. In case the drone meets any problems (interception, lack of communication) the dock / receiver sounds an alarm.

<p style=""text-align: left;"">Please note that the Shipping, Taxes, and/or Import duties, are not included in the campaign prices. The backer is responsible for all import duties, and/or taxes.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">Due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the significant fluctuations in international and domestic freight charges, we are currently unable to quote accurate shipping charges for the next 8-12 months. To avoid charging unfair shipping fees, we would prefer not to charge our backers until the shipping begins. Once your product is ready to ship, we will provide the best shipping options specific to your address, with complete transparency and no markups.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">All Canadian orders will be subject to the applicable Provincial and Federal taxes (PST/GST/HST). The listed prices are all exclusive of taxes. Canadian taxes will be collected separately along with the shipping expenses since Canadian Taxes are not applicable for backers from other counties. We will offer instalment payment options for accumulated payable shipping and Canadian Taxes, for Canadian Backers only. </p>

<p style=""text-align: left;"">The World Needs More Sustainable Commuting Solutions. At ULTIMA, we are on a mission to design and make eco-friendly sustainable hybrid bikes as a replacement for fossil fuels that are fun, convenient, and affordable.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">After years of hard work, Ultima is now at the pre-commercialization stage and ready for mass production. Technically, at this point, no obstacle unbale us from mass production; e-bikes, gears and equipment have been tested long enough, and all photos and videos are based on actual products; what you see is beyond the prototyping and the majority of parts are finalized. Currently only few detachable accessory brackets are still under improvement to be qualified for mass production.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">We try to avoid over promising and under delivering and planning for unexpected situations that are out of our control.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">The only matter that can affect the shipping time is the supply-chain delays or waiting times that can cause unwanted delay in our production time. However, we already considered all possible delays in our delivery time estimation based on current market demands and supply situation, post-pandemic. Nevertheless, we are trying to improve our sourcing to reduce supply chain delays and waiting times to fulfill the orders prior to the estimated delivery time.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""> </p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><strong>Why is it called the Ultima? </strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">Ultima is a Latin word synonym with Ultimate.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">Ultima SE Edition is an ultimate commuter solution that never have been offered before. </p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""> </p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><strong>What models do you offer?</strong></p>

</ul>
<p style=""text-align: left;""> </p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><strong>Ultima XS/XT are categorized in which class of e-Bikes? Do have other types of e-Bikes?</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">Ultima XS/XT are both Class (I), Paddle/Power Assist 250W, regulated as conventional bikes and they are road legal in most of countries around the world.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">Ultima XS is offer slick and stylish design that focused on weight saving, however the XT is offer fortitude design with fat tires, suspension fork and with dual batteries is more focused on range. </p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">Currently, we are prototyping new folding e-Bike. </p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""> </p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><strong>What colors do you offer for XS/XT?</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">We offer 9 colors:</p>
<ul>

<p style=""text-align: left;""> </p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><strong>Will COVID-19 affect the production and deliveries?</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">However currently, the pandemic has minimal direct effects on production itself, but it’s not deniable that has significant direct effects on part’s supply-chain and shipping time and expenses. Post covid-19 more people prefer to commute with bikes rather than public transportation whenever possible, so sudden increased demands on the market caused the delay in part’s supply-chain. On the other hand, the shipping time and expenses were increased by 3X.   </p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">We have over 34 manufacturing partners that are one of the best on industry and closely worked with them to optimize the manufacturing process and minimize the pandemic effects on production, however the part’s supply-chain delay and shipping are out of our sole control However, we are trying hard to manage unwanted or unexpected effects out of our control, with our best ability.</p>

<h3 style=""text-align: left;"">Technical</h3>
<p style=""text-align: left;""> </p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><strong>The XS and XT equipped with the same frame?</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">No, however both have similar frame design outlines but technically they are different.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""> </p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><strong>Will the production bikes be exactly like the ones pictured?</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">No, they would be even better, The photo and videos are from Prototypes, we constantly we are working to improve the design and functionality of parts, comfort and detachable brackets.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""> </p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><strong>Where is the battery?  </strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">The Ultima XS/XT both have unique frame designs with invisible detachable lithium 5.8Ah battery embedded on frame’s top tube, however the XT model also equipped with extra 7.8Ah lithium battery (13.6 Ah in total) locates under the seat post.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""> </p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><strong>What are the ranges for XS/XT? </strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">e-Bike’s ranges vary based on pedal assist level, incline levels, rider’s weight, type of terrains, climates, tire air pressure, and many other factors.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">The XS range is Min. 25km - Max. 60km; The XS average range in different road conditions: 30-40km</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">The XT range is Min. 55km - Max. 140km; The XT average range in different road conditions: 60-70km</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""> </p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><strong>The XS-SE and XT-SE equipped with the same motor and battery that used in Base models, how they have an extended range?</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">The SE package comes with the ultimate commuter package, included an extra detachable lithium 5.8Ah battery pack that extends the renege of XS-SE/XT-SE by an average 30-40km (Min. 25km- Max. 60km), and is replaceable under 30 Sec.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">The XS-SE range is Min. 50km - Max. 120km; The XS-SE average range in different road conditions: 60-80km</p>

<p style=""text-align: left;""><strong>What is the maximum speed for XS and XT?</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">The Class (I) e-Bikes maximum speed directly depends on rider’s muscular strengths, paddling power, rider’s weight, gear ratio and wheel’s size, train conditions, and some other factors;  However, based on Class (I) regulations the power assist mechanism (regardless of assist level) should cut off in certain speeds that is 32km/h (20 miles/h) in most of North American countries and 25km/h in most of European countries.  </p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">The Ultima XS/XT are Class (I) e-Bikes and follows the destination regulations for pedal/power assist cut-off speed.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">Ultima XS/XT e-bikes are designed for commuting, city travel, trekking or for leisure purposes, so the max speed really wasn’t the primary concern in the design and built; however, they are smoothly capable of achieving safe speeds (ranges from 35 to 50km/h) that balanced with braking performance for maximizing the safety for the rider and other commuters on the road.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""> </p>

<ul>
<li style=""text-align: left;"">When there is sufficient light (&gt; 30lux) is detected by sensor, the heal light start flashing as daytime warning light</li>
<li style=""text-align: left;"">When the sensor detected its dark (&lt; 30lux), the head light mode changed to steady 400 Lumen to illuminate the e-Bike path while saving power to extend the headlight running time.</li>
<li style=""text-align: left;"">When the e-Bike become stationary for more than 120 seconds, the smart mode enters into the sleep/standby state, indwell be return to working mode after sensing the movements, vibration, or clicking on the light button. </li>
</ul>

What are the risks that my pledge won’t be fulfilled?
The World Needs More Sustainable Commuting Solutions. At ULTIMA, we are on a mission to design and make eco-friendly sustainable hybrid bikes as a replacement for fossil fuels that are fun, convenient, and affordable.
After years of hard work, Ultima is now at the pre-commercialization stage and ready for mass production. Technically, at this point, no obstacle unbale us from mass production; e-bikes, gears and equipment have been tested long enough, and all photos and videos are based on actual products; what you see is beyond the prototyping and the majority of parts are finalized. Currently only few detachable accessory brackets are still under improvement to be qualified for mass production.
We try to avoid over promising and under delivering and planning for unexpected situations that are out of our control.
The only matter that can affect the shipping time is the supply-chain delays or waiting times that can cause unwanted delay in our production time. However, we already considered all possible delays in our delivery time estimation based on current market demands and supply situation, post-pandemic. Nevertheless, we are trying to improve our sourcing to reduce supply chain delays and waiting times to fulfill the orders prior to the estimated delivery time.

Payments and Shipping
 
When does it ship?
June 2022 is an estimated date, In Ultima, we avoid of over-promising and under-delivering; however, we are working hard to start the shipping from March 2022.
We have almost 34 manufacturing partners, the only matter that can affect the shipping time is the supply-chain delays or waiting times that can cause unwanted delay in our production time. However, we already considered all possible delays in our delivery time estimation based on current market demands and supply situation, post-pandemic. Nevertheless, we are trying to improve our sourcing to reduce supply chain delays and waiting times to fulfill the orders prior to the estimated delivery time. 
 
How much does the shipping cost?
Due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the significant fluctuations in international and domestic freight charges, we are currently unable to quote accurate shipping charges for the next 8-12 months. To avoid charging unfair shipping fees, we would prefer not to charge our backers until the shipping begins. Once your product is ready to ship, we will provide the best shipping options specific to your address, with complete transparency and no markups.
 
Who is responsible for additional duties, taxes, or VAT?
The backer is responsible, we strongly recommend you to check your local legislation before backing our campaign, since it might be varying in different countries; The import duties for Class-I Electric Bikes in the USA, Canada and some other countries is 0%.
 
Do you have financing?
We are negotiating to offer third-party financing options post campaign, please contact us at info@ultimaebikes.com
 
What is your refund policy?
Please refer to IndieGoGo's refund policy, Refunds are eligible before the end of the Indiegogo campaign. Since the bikes are made by order, unfortunately refunds are not eligible at the manufacturing stage.
 
What is your return/exchange policy?
At Ultima, all products pass through comprehensive Quality Control (QC) tests before shipping out, we process the returns/exchanges on a case-by-case basis, only unopened/unused products in original packaging are eligible for return or exchange. Please consider customers are responsible for shipping expenses in both-ways.

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>I've been a
keen mountain bike rider for more than 15 years, taking me to some of the
world’s most beautiful places around the globe. I've always enjoyed getting outdoors
in the fresh air and getting a bit of exercise. As an engineer I've seen
loads of innovation for all sorts of bikes in specialist areas, like road
cycling, mountain biking, down hill, and commuting. Not to mention the
explosion of trails, bikeways and commuter paths along with the push for social
responsibility.

</p>
<p>Until I was
introduced to fatbikes, I always thought you'd need a garage full of bikes to
really explore all the options a bike can offer (see image below). A fatbike has extra wide tires
giving so much more grip and traction, allowing you to go into places a normal
bike would simply get bogged.<br/>
<br/>
Of course the problem is the wide tires create a lot of drag and that means a lot
more sweat. Adding an electric motor seemed like the innovation that was
needed. I'd seen it done, but until I built one I would not have
guessed how an electric motor can make such a difference to the riding
experience. The first thing you notice is that the bike can move ahead without
you having to peddle, this makes it so much easier and safer to get going. Pedaling
along is easy and not an effort, but the choice is yours, you can cruise along using
the motor only or switch off the motor and have a great workout – it's up to
you. The low center of gravity and wide grip tires make the bike one of the
safest I've ever ridden, as well as being the most fun.<br/>
<br/>
Off road, the tires come into their own and give excellent grip and handling. Tire
pressure makes a big difference for grip, traction and smoothness of ride.
Mountain bike tires are typically 25-40 psi and road bikes much higher, up to
65psi, but the lower pressures, less than 20psi for a fatbike mean the ride is still smooth
and there is no need for heavy and costly suspension. For soft sand the tire
pressure can be reduced to very low levels to give great traction even on very
soft sand. In this area the electrics make such a difference.<br/>
<br/>
Having an electric motor means that people of all skill and fitness levels can
enjoy riding together and this makes it ideal for couples.<br/>
<br/>
An Electric fatbike is a great all round bike for commuting, off road trails,
exploring, adventuring and having loads of fun especially with friends.

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The increase in
bike pathways for commuters and short distance travel is having a positive effect
on the environment. Electric bikes are the lowest carbon emission form of
transport period (see independent report). The lack of exercise in modern
society is seen as the single biggest problem we face in the health of our

<p></p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The biggest technical challenge is around quality control. Here at

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">CyberDash Story</h3>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Hello everyone! My name is Andrea Gini, and I have a passion for machines. As a child, I disassembled and re-assembled my computer to understand how it worked, and turned that into a career of over 23 years in information technology. I am a founding member of the first not-for-profit maker space in Barcelona, Spain, and contributor on city grid infrastructure and large art installations appearing at Burning Man and across the world. When I am not focused on computers, I am riding and maintaining motorcycles, and for the last 9 years, that has been with a BMW R1200 GS. I love this machine, and while I am not ready to trade it in, the features on newer models got me thinking about creating an upgrade to the interface. In recent history, humans have taken to adapting analog tools to the modern standards of the digital era — everything from toothbrushes to vehicles — with easy-to-read digital screens and phone app interactivity, and my hope was to bring these features to a replacement dashboard.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">With the entire world in lockdown, I finally found the time to bring this idea to fruition. Thanks to the manufacturing experience of our team at Aviatek Flight Simulators, together we built a digital dashboard for my machine. After sharing the progress with my local off-road adventure group, I discovered that I am not alone in my excitement about this project. This broad interest has given me the motivation to take the CyberDash from a personal project to a fully-developed prototype, now ready to be made available to R1200 GS owners world wide.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
</div><div>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">In order to make CyberDash widely available, we need to meet our goal of €60,000 to begin production. The bulk of the funds will go toward manufacturing the custom mold for the chassis, followed by the glass and electronic components.</p>

</div></div>","CyberDash Story
Hello everyone! My name is Andrea Gini, and I have a passion for machines. As a child, I disassembled and re-assembled my computer to understand how it worked, and turned that into a career of over 23 years in information technology. I am a founding member of the first not-for-profit maker space in Barcelona, Spain, and contributor on city grid infrastructure and large art installations appearing at Burning Man and across the world. When I am not focused on computers, I am riding and maintaining motorcycles, and for the last 9 years, that has been with a BMW R1200 GS. I love this machine, and while I am not ready to trade it in, the features on newer models got me thinking about creating an upgrade to the interface. In recent history, humans have taken to adapting analog tools to the modern standards of the digital era — everything from toothbrushes to vehicles — with easy-to-read digital screens and phone app interactivity, and my hope was to bring these features to a replacement dashboard.
With the entire world in lockdown, I finally found the time to bring this idea to fruition. Thanks to the manufacturing experience of our team at Aviatek Flight Simulators, together we built a digital dashboard for my machine. After sharing the progress with my local off-road adventure group, I discovered that I am not alone in my excitement about this project. This broad interest has given me the motivation to take the CyberDash from a personal project to a fully-developed prototype, now ready to be made available to R1200 GS owners world wide.
 

What We Need & What You Get
In order to make CyberDash widely available, we need to meet our goal of €60,000 to begin production. The bulk of the funds will go toward manufacturing the custom mold for the chassis, followed by the glass and electronic components.
This is why we need for you to back CyberDash now!
The 7-inch digital TFT display streamlines all of the important, real-time information you need from your motorcycle into one place. The easy-to-read screen assures that you can quickly check your stats while you keep your focus on what matters most — your surroundings.
When we reach our goal we will start the production process and you will receive your CyberDash in January 2021
 
Important Note
This is a fixed funding campaign (all or nothing). 
In the event that we reach our goal production will begin in September.
In the event that we do not reach our goal production will not go forward, and all funds will be automatically returned to you by Indiegogo.

<h3 align=""center""> </h3>
<h3 align=""center"">Say goodbye to numb hands and sore wrists!</h3>
<p align=""center"">Designed to fit the hand and support good posture, Handalz mean more miles in comfort.</p>
<p align=""center""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1600012557/e4k6rtwzdekrwvhtvbtd.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p align=""center"">So, whether you’re going round the park, or across the country, Handalz can make a difference to your ride.</p>
<p align=""center""> </p>
<h3 align=""center"">What's the problem?</h3>
<p align=""center"">Standard bicycle grips (both cylinder and current ergo grips) promote poor posture and uneven load distribution. They allow the wrist to collapse down and out, placing strain on the tendons and pressure on key nerve sites.</p>
<p align=""center""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1600072860/zdbeiq0yqvoih9xz9tsn.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p align=""center"">And that’s why your hands and wrists get tired, sore, or even injured.</p>
<p align=""center""> </p>
<h3 align=""center"">What's the solution?</h3>
<p align=""center"">Handalz distinctive design supports the hand and prevents the collapse of the wrist.</p>
<p align=""center""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://media.giphy.com/media/Qw6uHfdyYTTJHgEI8a/giphy.gif"" src=""""/></p>
<p align=""center"">The end result is a stronger, more natural posture, where the wrist can perform its role as a shock absorber and load is distributed more evenly across the hand.</p>
<p align=""center""> </p>
<h3 align=""center"">Are Handalz really different?</h3>
<p align=""center""><strong>Yes!</strong> Some current ergo grip designs do a decent job of enlarging the load bearing surface area, but they can't be rotated forward enough to support good posture without risk of sliding off the flat upper surface (e.g. when braking). So strain on the wrist and load on key nerve sites remain high. The unique design of Handalz can safely be mounted higher, supporting better posture without that risk of slippage.</p>
<p align=""center"">This means that Handalz can address <strong>both</strong> root causes of common issues.</p>
<p align=""center""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1601033890/tblxlpsayqfgbzhw2xbk.png"" src=""""/></p>

<p align=""center""> </p>
<h3 align=""center"">Are Handalz just for people with an injury?</h3>
<p align=""center""><strong>No!</strong> Think about hiking boots. You wouldn't recommend them only for people with a foot injury caused by walking too much. They're simply the right equipment for the job and everyone should be wearing them.</p>
<h3><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1600096094/v4yuycl93p7nz1oyur0e.png"" src=""""/></h3>
<h3 align=""center""> </h3>
<h3 align=""center"">It works!</h3>
<p align=""center"">Handalz have been independently tested in collaboration with Edinburgh Napier University.</p>

<h5 align=""center"">In the Lab</h5>
<p align=""center"">Sophisticated 3D capture systems allowed them to measure the precise benefits to posture, with <strong>100% of riders</strong> seeing improvements.</p>

<p align=""center"">Importantly, Handalz reduced flexion across a key 26 degree threshold that research has shown to be associated with poorer carpal tunnel syndrome outcomes.</p>
<h5 align=""center"">On the Road</h5>
<p align=""center"">In the same independent testing we received <strong>96% positive feedback</strong> on the riding experience! Here are some of our favourite quotes from testers and our broader user community.</p>

<p align=""center""> </p>
<h3 align=""center"">The Design Process</h3>
<p align=""center"">The Handalz journey began with a simple goal: to make cycling more comfortable for everyone.</p>
<p align=""center"">Over the course of literally hundreds of iterations we refined the design to optimise posture and reduce strain.</p>
<p align=""center""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://media.giphy.com/media/0HbswBKF6FipBErCKF/giphy.gif"" src=""""/></p>
<p align=""center""> </p>
<p align=""center"">Along the way we consulted with medical professionals (hand surgeon), sports performance experts and (most importantly) cyclists. Handalz constantly evolved based on feedback and testing.</p>
<p align=""center""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1601213791/awva282nmamq4j0krobm.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p align=""center""> </p>
<p align=""center"">Next, the award winning professional design team brought their skills to bear, ensuring that Handalz incorporate the highest standards of industrial engineering. Handalz are made in a two-step injection moulding process. </p>
<p align=""center"">A semi-rigid substrate provides structure.</p>
<p align=""center""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1601133672/xcqymzaag59pfijloa9g.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">A softer outer material provides cushioning and dampens vibration.</p>

<p> </p>
<h3 align=""center"">What's left to do?</h3>
<p align=""center"">We have a fully functional prototype that has been thoroughly (and independently) tested. We also have a beautiful final aesthetic design, shown above. To ensure the product you receive doesn't just perform well but also looks great, these will be merged in a final design phase before manufacture. Note that we are NOT messing with the proven features, so no surprises!</p>
<p align=""center""> </p>
<h3 align=""center"">Who are the BikeSenz team?</h3>
<p align=""center"">We're a small group of passionate cyclists who really believe that there is a better way. We also have an extensive group of advisors spanning disciplines from medicine (hand surgeon), to the cycling industry, to sports performance experts to ensure we create the best product possible. Clearly, this is a business venture, but we are also unashamedly passionate about cycling and the benefits it can have for both people and the planet. Our mission is to make cycling more fun for everyone.</p>
<p align=""center""> </p>
<h3 align=""center"">Schedule</h3>
<p align=""center"">Below is the schedule for estimated Handalz delivery. Our team includes members with extensive project delivery experience from blue chip companies, so we feel good about meeting our promises. Obviously we will be fully transparent in the event of any updates.</p>

<h3 align=""center""> </h3>
<h3 align=""center"">What if the project fails to meet its funding goal?</h3>
<p align=""center"">If we don't raise sufficient funds to deliver, we'll refund all our supporters. End of story.</p>
<h3 align=""center""> </h3>
<h3 align=""center"">Are Handalz right for me?</h3>
<p align=""center"">Version 1 of Handalz has been refined for the majority of riders (e.g. commute, park ride, etc). If you're an extreme off roader with an aggressive elbows out stance then you may find the radial deviation correction in version 1 too strong. We also like the idea of a double lock ring design to handle the rigours of extreme off road use. Stay tuned!</p>

Say goodbye to numb hands and sore wrists!
Designed to fit the hand and support good posture, Handalz mean more miles in comfort.

So, whether you’re going round the park, or across the country, Handalz can make a difference to your ride.
 
What's the problem?
Standard bicycle grips (both cylinder and current ergo grips) promote poor posture and uneven load distribution. They allow the wrist to collapse down and out, placing strain on the tendons and pressure on key nerve sites.

And that’s why your hands and wrists get tired, sore, or even injured.
 
What's the solution?
Handalz distinctive design supports the hand and prevents the collapse of the wrist.

The end result is a stronger, more natural posture, where the wrist can perform its role as a shock absorber and load is distributed more evenly across the hand.
 
Are Handalz really different?
Yes! Some current ergo grip designs do a decent job of enlarging the load bearing surface area, but they can't be rotated forward enough to support good posture without risk of sliding off the flat upper surface (e.g. when braking). So strain on the wrist and load on key nerve sites remain high. The unique design of Handalz can safely be mounted higher, supporting better posture without that risk of slippage.
This means that Handalz can address both root causes of common issues.


 
Are Handalz just for people with an injury?
No! Think about hiking boots. You wouldn't recommend them only for people with a foot injury caused by walking too much. They're simply the right equipment for the job and everyone should be wearing them.

 
It works!
Handalz have been independently tested in collaboration with Edinburgh Napier University.

In the Lab
Sophisticated 3D capture systems allowed them to measure the precise benefits to posture, with 100% of riders seeing improvements.

Importantly, Handalz reduced flexion across a key 26 degree threshold that research has shown to be associated with poorer carpal tunnel syndrome outcomes.
On the Road
In the same independent testing we received 96% positive feedback on the riding experience! Here are some of our favourite quotes from testers and our broader user community.

And our personal favourite from two time Scottish cyclocross champion Iain Paton when we put his regular grips back on his bike :)
""These thin grips feel weird!""
This is Iain enjoying Handalz before we stole them back!
 
 
Installs in seconds
Handalz can be installed in seconds on any standard straight handlebar.
 
 
The Design Process
The Handalz journey began with a simple goal: to make cycling more comfortable for everyone.
Over the course of literally hundreds of iterations we refined the design to optimise posture and reduce strain.

 
Along the way we consulted with medical professionals (hand surgeon), sports performance experts and (most importantly) cyclists. Handalz constantly evolved based on feedback and testing.

 
Next, the award winning professional design team brought their skills to bear, ensuring that Handalz incorporate the highest standards of industrial engineering. Handalz are made in a two-step injection moulding process. 
A semi-rigid substrate provides structure.

A softer outer material provides cushioning and dampens vibration.

An aluminium lock ring completes the assembly, providing a secure mounting point to the bike.

 
The end result is a patent pending design that addresses the weaknesses of current options.

 
And looks beautiful too!

 
Technical Specifications

 
What's left to do?
We have a fully functional prototype that has been thoroughly (and independently) tested. We also have a beautiful final aesthetic design, shown above. To ensure the product you receive doesn't just perform well but also looks great, these will be merged in a final design phase before manufacture. Note that we are NOT messing with the proven features, so no surprises!
 
Who are the BikeSenz team?
We're a small group of passionate cyclists who really believe that there is a better way. We also have an extensive group of advisors spanning disciplines from medicine (hand surgeon), to the cycling industry, to sports performance experts to ensure we create the best product possible. Clearly, this is a business venture, but we are also unashamedly passionate about cycling and the benefits it can have for both people and the planet. Our mission is to make cycling more fun for everyone.
 
Schedule
Below is the schedule for estimated Handalz delivery. Our team includes members with extensive project delivery experience from blue chip companies, so we feel good about meeting our promises. Obviously we will be fully transparent in the event of any updates.

 
What if the project fails to meet its funding goal?
If we don't raise sufficient funds to deliver, we'll refund all our supporters. End of story.
 
Are Handalz right for me?
Version 1 of Handalz has been refined for the majority of riders (e.g. commute, park ride, etc). If you're an extreme off roader with an aggressive elbows out stance then you may find the radial deviation correction in version 1 too strong. We also like the idea of a double lock ring design to handle the rigours of extreme off road use. Stay tuned!

<p><strong>Hovercraft Aren't (just) Science Fiction <br/></strong>Hovercraft are the most versatile of recreational vehicles, becuase they can travel over water and land in a variety of environments. Hovercraft travel on a cushion of air and literally hover right above the surface. This low level ""flying"" makes it possible to travel over grass, water, sand, ice, and many other terrain. Because they are traveling on air, there is very little friction to overcome, so recreational hovercraft can travel smoothly at speeds up to 40-60 miles per hour. Hovercraft can be piloted in lakes, ponds, rivers, beaches, fields, and in your back yard.</p>

<span><strong>A Cool Design is Only the Start<br/></strong></span>The core technology of hovercraft has been around for over 50 years, and it's time for an upgrade. We are pioneering the development of hovercraft that are quieter, easier to maneuver, and more environmentally friendly. Mercier-Jones hovercraft will allow you to hover without the need for earplugs, will offer steering and braking ability similar to a car, and fly-by-wire control on a gas-electric hybrid power train to unlock design potential. Our patent pending hovercraft directional control system allows fine tuned control in the forward, lateral and reverse directions. Independent control over each side of the thrust system enables advanced maneuvering for the pilot.</div>

<span><strong>The Nuts and Bolts... and Carbon Fiber<br/></strong></span>The hovercraft will employ state-of-the-art materials and components from the marine, automotive, and aerospace industries, but without the hefty price tag. By utilizing existing technologies and fabrication methods, we will be able to build vehicles that the general public can purchase and enjoy. Weight saving materials like aluminum and carbon fiber will give our hovercraft better performance characteristics and more stylish looks. We want every detail of a Mercier-Jones hovercraft to evoke quality and performance. We want the price tag to be within reach. Our goal is for our entry level hovercraft to cost $19,900 or less.</div>

<div><strong>A Dedicated Team</strong></div>
<div>Michael Mercier has been talking about building hovercraft since the 8th grade. He built three in 9th grade and nearly won in his category for an all-grades high school science fair. He designed and built a four-person hovercraft the summer after highschool. It had some flaws, but he re-designed it and built a better one two years later. The MML1 ""Red Bench"" hovercraft is the working proof of concept for his simple and efficient plenum-hull lift system design. During and after completing his degree in Mechanical Engineering at VCU and focusing in product development, he has designed and built everything from <a href=""http://www.insitu.com/integrator"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">UAVs</a> to<a href=""http://www.fellowes.com/us/en/Products/Pages/product-category.aspx?cat=SHREDDERS"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""> Paper Shredders</a> including VTOL Craft,<a href=""http://www.news.vcu.edu/news/Prototype_phase_of_da_Vinci_Center_project_unveiled_Operating"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Surgical Tables</a>, <a href=""http://www.radioflyer.com/wagons/comfort-embrace-wagon.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Wagons</a>, <a href=""http://www.radioflyer.com/slider-rider.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Tri-Cycles</a>, and Packaging Machinery. His passion for hovercraft stays strong and he's ready to build the future of these vehicles through Mercier-Jones.</div>
<div>
<p>Chris Jones is Michael Mercier's cousin but the two are practically brothers. Chris is a natural role model and a brilliant business mind who has always been interested in how companies enter the marketplace, offer products consumers want, become national or global competitors and everything in-between. He grew up with close ties to prominent businessmen in the state of Oklahoma and has always dreamed of one day owning his very own company. This led him to complete his degree in Business Administration, which only furthered his interest in the business world. Chris is also a car fanatic who has grown up admiring the automotive form, both functionally and aesthetically, so when Michael suggested they re-shape the face of the hovercraft industry by infusing modern automotive design, he was immediately committed.</p>

<h2>Frequently Asked Questions:</h2>
<div>
<div><span><strong>Where can I use the Mercier-Jones hovercraft? What are the laws for them?</strong></span></div>
<div><span>Hovercraft can be used in water such as lakes, rivers, ponds and oceans and on land such as fields, beaches, dirt and gravel. Hovercraft can also be used in areas such as swamps, frozen waterways, dry riverbeds and a large variety of other locations.</span></div>
<div><span> </span></div>
<div><span>When operating a hovercraft over water, the hovercraft should be registered and insured as a boat. When operating a hovercraft on land, it should be registered and insured as an all-terrain vehicle. </span></div>
<div><span> </span></div>
<div>
<div>
<div><span><strong>Can they survive rough waters? </strong></span></div>
<div>This first Mercier-Jones hovercraft model is about the size of a small speed boat, so it will be able to handle about the same water conditions. Generally, if its not safe for you to be out in a small boat, you would want to hover on land for that day. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>
<div>
<div><span><strong>Are hovercraft street legal? Can I drive this on the road?</strong></span></div>
<div>Hovercraft are not currently street legal, but Mercier-Jones has plans in the pipeline for that.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>
<div>
<div><span><strong>What safety considerations went into the design?</strong></span></div>
<div><span>Four of the top safety considerations are number one, protecting the pilot and passengers from the lift and thrust fans. The cockpit is not exposed to any of the fans and the intakes and exhausts are protected by guards to keep the fans out of accidental reach. Second, the cockpit and windshield serve to protect passengers from debris. Third, the hovercraft will have inherent flotation and emergency power to get the hovercraft to shore if something unexpected happens while out on the water. Fourthly, the ability to reverse thrust and maneuver with ease gives the pilot more control and ability to avoid a collision.</span></div>
<div><span> </span></div>
<div>
<div>
<div><span><strong>When can I buy a Mercier-Jones hovercraft?</strong></span></div>
<div><span>At the end of the indiegogo campaign, Mercier-Jones will offer the opportunity to get on the waiting list for the first production ready hovercrafts.

Hovercraft Aren't (just) Science Fiction Hovercraft are the most versatile of recreational vehicles, becuase they can travel over water and land in a variety of environments. Hovercraft travel on a cushion of air and literally hover right above the surface. This low level ""flying"" makes it possible to travel over grass, water, sand, ice, and many other terrain. Because they are traveling on air, there is very little friction to overcome, so recreational hovercraft can travel smoothly at speeds up to 40-60 miles per hour. Hovercraft can be piloted in lakes, ponds, rivers, beaches, fields, and in your back yard.

 

 

 

From Concepts to Reality The automotive industry is filled with futuristic concept cars that inspire and intrigue us, but we never actually get to drive them because they are never manufactured. The technology of a hovercraft is both futuristic and intriguing, but the designs of current production models don't inspire the way they should. We are here to change that. Our concepts are the future of personal hovercraft, and it's time to start building them to make you the next pilot.

 

 
We have already built several hovercraft prototypes in less eye-catching forms. These prototypes, and the lessons learned from them, make up the foundation of knowledge that will bring this current design to fruition. The MML1 ""Red Bench"" is an original design and prototype of a hovercraft lift system. If you pledge at the $65 level, you can build a version of this prototype and start developing with us.
 


Building the MML1 Hovercraft Prototype
 

Hovering on the ""Red Bench""
 


A Cool Design is Only the StartThe core technology of hovercraft has been around for over 50 years, and it's time for an upgrade. We are pioneering the development of hovercraft that are quieter, easier to maneuver, and more environmentally friendly. Mercier-Jones hovercraft will allow you to hover without the need for earplugs, will offer steering and braking ability similar to a car, and fly-by-wire control on a gas-electric hybrid power train to unlock design potential. Our patent pending hovercraft directional control system allows fine tuned control in the forward, lateral and reverse directions. Independent control over each side of the thrust system enables advanced maneuvering for the pilot.
 



The Nuts and Bolts... and Carbon FiberThe hovercraft will employ state-of-the-art materials and components from the marine, automotive, and aerospace industries, but without the hefty price tag. By utilizing existing technologies and fabrication methods, we will be able to build vehicles that the general public can purchase and enjoy. Weight saving materials like aluminum and carbon fiber will give our hovercraft better performance characteristics and more stylish looks. We want every detail of a Mercier-Jones hovercraft to evoke quality and performance. We want the price tag to be within reach. Our goal is for our entry level hovercraft to cost $19,900 or less.
 

 

Give the Development a Go! As an IndieGoGo.com backer you are essential for us to build fully functional versions of the hovercraft as you see them pictured here. Your contribution will fund the purchasing of components, materials, and equipment to build and test several vehicles that we will bring around the country for your enjoyment. Don’t get us wrong, Mercier-Jones has tools of our own, but with your help, we don’t have to be the only ones who get to enjoy what they can build. The ultimate reward for us will be safely piloting one of these incredible machines over land and water and bringing that experience to others; that's why every backer gets a ride! Your comments, feedback, and suggestions will also be invaluable for us to bring you the hovercraft that you have been waiting for.

Project Timeline
 
A Dedicated Team
Michael Mercier has been talking about building hovercraft since the 8th grade. He built three in 9th grade and nearly won in his category for an all-grades high school science fair. He designed and built a four-person hovercraft the summer after highschool. It had some flaws, but he re-designed it and built a better one two years later. The MML1 ""Red Bench"" hovercraft is the working proof of concept for his simple and efficient plenum-hull lift system design. During and after completing his degree in Mechanical Engineering at VCU and focusing in product development, he has designed and built everything from UAVs to Paper Shredders including VTOL Craft,Surgical Tables, Wagons, Tri-Cycles, and Packaging Machinery. His passion for hovercraft stays strong and he's ready to build the future of these vehicles through Mercier-Jones.

Chris Jones is Michael Mercier's cousin but the two are practically brothers. Chris is a natural role model and a brilliant business mind who has always been interested in how companies enter the marketplace, offer products consumers want, become national or global competitors and everything in-between. He grew up with close ties to prominent businessmen in the state of Oklahoma and has always dreamed of one day owning his very own company. This led him to complete his degree in Business Administration, which only furthered his interest in the business world. Chris is also a car fanatic who has grown up admiring the automotive form, both functionally and aesthetically, so when Michael suggested they re-shape the face of the hovercraft industry by infusing modern automotive design, he was immediately committed.

 Bike lock designs haven't kept pace with the tools thieves use. In the past 10 years battery powered angle grinders have become commonplace and can cut through any lock currently on the market in seconds. The SAF Lock is the first lock designed specifically to defend against portable angle grinders. We put the SAF Lock and the current leading bicycle locks up against the best portable angle grinders as chosen by Popular Mechanics. While all bike locks on the market that we've tested were cut in under 45 seconds, the SAF Lock outlasted every portable angle grinder.Bicycling Magazine took our lock to task and produced a comprehensive testing video. While it takes seconds to get through normal bicycle locks, it took Bicycling Magazine over an hour and multiple angle grinders, blades and batteries to get through our lock. Read and watch their complete review here.  The SAF Tech Shell prevents any meaningful damage from occurring while causing damage to the angle grinder disc. The SAF Tech Shell is designed to withstand attacks from angle grinders with cutting discs up to 5 inches in diameter.All portable angle grinders tested against the SAF Lock eventually failed due to one or more of of the following:
Battery died.
Angle grinder overheated.
Angle grinder disc broke.
No portable angle grinder has been able to cut through the SAF Lock.  In the last 10 years, there has been a large shift in bicycle theft from bolt cutters and hacksaws to portable angle grinders. This has been driven by lithium-ion batteries and ever more compact and affordable angle grinders. Simply put, right now any thief can walk into a hardware store and get an angle grinder for under $100 which will fit more easily in their backpack than a bolt cutter. In addition to protecting against angle grinders you can count on the SAF Lock to protect your bike against bolt cutters, hacksaws, hammers, levers, bottle jacks and lock picks.  We designed the SAF Lock to be as strong as possible, not as portable as possible.

<h2>The Bravo Project</h2>
<p><strong>This campaign is the culmination of the years of experience I've gained in design and manufacturing.  I had no idea how complicated gear design is and to this day still say it's rocket science!  </strong></p>
<p><strong>The Bravo Project is an improvement on an existing Original Equipment Manufacturer's gear design through advanced analysis, design and manufacturing. </strong></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1583852785/ptyfrr23ybbvpch5kry0.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>This Is What The Bravo XR Drives Look Like On A Boat</i></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<h3><strong>Here's The Problem</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Many recreational and marine work force boats utilize stern drive propulsion systems such as the Bravo XR manufactured by Mercury Marine (Brunswick Corporation).  The Bravo XR stern drive transmission specifically utilizes a cone clutch method to allow the engine torque to be transmitted to the propeller in either the forward or reverse direction, eliminating the need for a dedicated transmission.</strong></p>
<p><br/><strong>The above described stern drive units provided by Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEM) have been designed for use within certain horsepower and torque specifications including maximum recommendations.  Boat operation and/or engine modifications can cause stresses to the stern drive unit components which may cause them to prematurely fail, specifically the bevel gears of the cone clutch, due to fatigue or yield stresses, causing more frequent and costly repairs.</strong></p>
<p><br/><strong>Boat operation necessitates the modulation of the throttle in different surface conditions as the water produces resistance to the drive system through the propeller/s.   Calm surface conditions create somewhat stable resistance forces.  Chop or larger wave conditions create intermittent resistance forces as boat speed increases.  Proper operation of a boat is to utilize the throttle to increase power and speed while the drive is submerged, and reduce the throttle input if/when the drive is out of the water.  As the boat’s speed increases and achieves plane, the drives can leave the water which significantly reduces the resistance to the propeller, creating an over-rev situation.  The operator must then reduce throttle input and engine/propeller rpm to more closely match the boat speed at the point the drive and propeller returns and reengages with the water surface to avoid a thrust shock to the equipment. Failure and the resulting damage of the stern drives and their components occur when the boat and drive reconnect with the water and the resistance, or load, is transmitted to the drive in the form of a shock.  This is a regular occurrence and the modulation technique is required regardless of engine horsepower, torque or drive specification limits.</strong></p>
<p><strong><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1583789364/ixncl7xjcwrygjpmpvk4.jpg"" src=""""/></strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>This is a perfect example of tooth shear at the root.  This also shows the toe (or top) of the tooth completely unconnected as designed from the factory.</i></p>
<p><br/><strong>As boat owners increase the horsepower and torque of their engines, while still utilizing the OEM stern drives, they increase the likelihood of failure of the stern drives as the input exceeds the design limits.   The results are more frequent and costly repairs as well as reduced time and enjoyment on the water. Failures occur throughout the drive components and will typically cascade and compound.  Several methods and improvements to shafts, case housings and other related components have been developed and are available as retrofits.  These improvements tend to solve specific component durability issues yet pass on the potential failure to the components not improved.   The cone clutch gear set, its design and method of manufacture have not been addressed.</strong></p>
<p><br/><strong>As a result, the OEM bevel gears suffer from a lack of proper structural support of the gear teeth, non-optimal tooth profile and failure of the friction weld.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Our design improvements focus on the three points of failure. </strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Unsupported toe of the bevel gear teeth.  </strong></li>
<li><strong>Overall non-optimized tooth design including tooth, root and contact profiles.  </strong></li>

<h3><strong>What Happened</strong></h3>
<p><strong>We went to a gear manufacturer and had them create 20 sets of the 2 parts of the 3-piece design and the pinion gear, which are made on conventional Gleason gear cutting machines.  I was there when they were cutting them and it went just fine.  We had the Ring made by another machine shop utilizing a 5-axis machine.  </strong></p>
<p><strong>When it was time to put the 3-piece design together, the Support Ring was not snug as per the design.  We have determined that we need to produce another set of the support ring to more accurately fit the Gleason cut gear tooth profile.</strong></p>

<h3><strong>The Impact</strong></h3>
<ul><li><strong>This is a unique solution, as we found in our patent search, application and granting.  We've come up with a novel and one-off design to support this style of gear, and while this is a marine application, there are potentially other uses.</strong></li></ul>
<p> </p>
<ul><li><strong>This gear set continues to be produced for new Mercury Bravo XR drives as well as replacements for worn or broken gears.  The market will continue into the future for many years to come.</strong></li></ul>
<p> </p>
<ul><li><strong>The performance boating world has been clamoring for a solution since the inception of the drive in the early 2000's.  There are currently many aftermarket parts offerings available to prolong the life of the drives including upgraded shafts and housings.</strong></li></ul>
<p> </p>
<ul><li><strong>The design of the gears themselves, in that they have a receptacle for the cone clutch, inhibits an easy solution to upgrading the gears through conventional means.  That's why this solution is so unique.  </strong></li></ul>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>People have been stumped but not us!</strong></h3>
<p> </p>
<ul><li>
<strong>The most significant values of this new product are:</strong><ul>
<li>
<strong>​The amount of time a boat owner will be able to spend enjoying their passion.</strong><ul><li><strong>​There is predominantly a limited time to comfortably boat in the U.S., ranging from 3-5 months. If our product could extend that boating season how much would that be worth to someone? </strong></li></ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>​Dollars, plain and simple.</strong><ul>
<li><strong>​We will be asking for a premium over the existing OEM gear offering but predict that our gears will extend the life of the drive, given proper operation and maintenance, by 2 to 4 times.  </strong></li>
<li><strong>The Return On Investment would be extremely fast.</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li></ul>
<p><strong>​</strong></p>
</div><div>
<h3><strong>Risks &amp; Challenges</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Now that we have been through a prototype build, we've learned valuable lessons in purchase order contract development.  We will be requiring CMM or laser measurement testing of ALL parts that come off the line in the future, not just random sampling to avoid any quality and dimensional deviations.</strong></li>
<li><strong>We have excellent engineers that will be guiding us through this next phase.</strong></li>
<li><b>We have spoken with several stern drive experts and have been assured that the need and demand is there to support this effort.</b></li>

This Is What The Bravo XR Drives Look Like On A Boat
 
Here's The Problem
Many recreational and marine work force boats utilize stern drive propulsion systems such as the Bravo XR manufactured by Mercury Marine (Brunswick Corporation).  The Bravo XR stern drive transmission specifically utilizes a cone clutch method to allow the engine torque to be transmitted to the propeller in either the forward or reverse direction, eliminating the need for a dedicated transmission.
The above described stern drive units provided by Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEM) have been designed for use within certain horsepower and torque specifications including maximum recommendations.  Boat operation and/or engine modifications can cause stresses to the stern drive unit components which may cause them to prematurely fail, specifically the bevel gears of the cone clutch, due to fatigue or yield stresses, causing more frequent and costly repairs.
Boat operation necessitates the modulation of the throttle in different surface conditions as the water produces resistance to the drive system through the propeller/s.   Calm surface conditions create somewhat stable resistance forces.  Chop or larger wave conditions create intermittent resistance forces as boat speed increases.  Proper operation of a boat is to utilize the throttle to increase power and speed while the drive is submerged, and reduce the throttle input if/when the drive is out of the water.  As the boat’s speed increases and achieves plane, the drives can leave the water which significantly reduces the resistance to the propeller, creating an over-rev situation.  The operator must then reduce throttle input and engine/propeller rpm to more closely match the boat speed at the point the drive and propeller returns and reengages with the water surface to avoid a thrust shock to the equipment. Failure and the resulting damage of the stern drives and their components occur when the boat and drive reconnect with the water and the resistance, or load, is transmitted to the drive in the form of a shock.  This is a regular occurrence and the modulation technique is required regardless of engine horsepower, torque or drive specification limits.

This is a perfect example of tooth shear at the root.  This also shows the toe (or top) of the tooth completely unconnected as designed from the factory.
As boat owners increase the horsepower and torque of their engines, while still utilizing the OEM stern drives, they increase the likelihood of failure of the stern drives as the input exceeds the design limits.   The results are more frequent and costly repairs as well as reduced time and enjoyment on the water. Failures occur throughout the drive components and will typically cascade and compound.  Several methods and improvements to shafts, case housings and other related components have been developed and are available as retrofits.  These improvements tend to solve specific component durability issues yet pass on the potential failure to the components not improved.   The cone clutch gear set, its design and method of manufacture have not been addressed.
As a result, the OEM bevel gears suffer from a lack of proper structural support of the gear teeth, non-optimal tooth profile and failure of the friction weld.
Our design improvements focus on the three points of failure. 

Unsupported toe of the bevel gear teeth.  
Overall non-optimized tooth design including tooth, root and contact profiles.  
Failure of the friction weld that joins the two component parts.

When it was time to put the 3-piece design together, the Support Ring was not snug as per the design.  We have determined that we need to produce another set of the support ring to more accurately fit the Gleason cut gear tooth profile.

This is the Support Ring in it's fixture after 5-axis machining.

This is the Support Ring being measured by precision CMM.

Computer Analysis of Support Ring​
​​

The Impact
This is a unique solution, as we found in our patent search, application and granting.  We've come up with a novel and one-off design to support this style of gear, and while this is a marine application, there are potentially other uses.
 
This gear set continues to be produced for new Mercury Bravo XR drives as well as replacements for worn or broken gears.  The market will continue into the future for many years to come.
 
The performance boating world has been clamoring for a solution since the inception of the drive in the early 2000's.  There are currently many aftermarket parts offerings available to prolong the life of the drives including upgraded shafts and housings.
 
The design of the gears themselves, in that they have a receptacle for the cone clutch, inhibits an easy solution to upgrading the gears through conventional means.  That's why this solution is so unique.  
People have been stumped but not us!
 

The most significant values of this new product are:

​The amount of time a boat owner will be able to spend enjoying their passion.​There is predominantly a limited time to comfortably boat in the U.S., ranging from 3-5 months. If our product could extend that boating season how much would that be worth to someone? 


​Dollars, plain and simple.
​We will be asking for a premium over the existing OEM gear offering but predict that our gears will extend the life of the drive, given proper operation and maintenance, by 2 to 4 times.  
The Return On Investment would be extremely fast.




​

Risks & Challenges

Now that we have been through a prototype build, we've learned valuable lessons in purchase order contract development.  We will be requiring CMM or laser measurement testing of ALL parts that come off the line in the future, not just random sampling to avoid any quality and dimensional deviations.
We have excellent engineers that will be guiding us through this next phase.
We have spoken with several stern drive experts and have been assured that the need and demand is there to support this effort.


About Us

Hi, I'm John Allert.  I've worn a lot of hats in my working years, primarily as a sales consultant in the computer and telecom industries.  Got laid off in the telecom bust in 2003 and couldn't even get an interview.  So, I had to figure it out on my own by developing some new products and learning new skills like CAD, metal fabrication, laser programming, forming and welding.  In addition to the images below, you can visit my website to view what I am currently producing at: http://redalertracegear.com

<p><b>How do I install ZHOR?</b></p>
<p>ZHOR can be installed by
anyone, you have to choose where to place it, drill a hole for all the cables
plus four fixing points, connect all cables according to the supplied
instructions and secure the console to your car’s dashboard. This is not
complicated but if you prefer, you can go to your usual garage and ask someone
to do it.</p>
<p><b>How can I connect audio to
my car’s stereo?</b></p>
<p>ZHOR can stream audio to
your car by Bluetooth. If your car’s stereo does not have this function, you
can simply connect the audio cable to the AUX line in.</p>
<p><b>Where can I place the
rear-parking camera?</b></p>
<p>You should choose a place
in your car’s rear, near the license plate. Then you drill a hole with the
supplied equipment and install the cable from the camera to ZHOR.</p>
<p><b>How to calibrate the guidelines
in the rear-parking camera?</b></p>
<p>Since all cars are
different, you must calibrate the guidelines to meet your cars specifications
(size and height are an important factor). A simple process in the setup menu
can achieve this.</p>
<p><b>What is this OBD2 connector?</b></p>
<p>This connector is used to
send data from your car’s onboard computer to ZHOR. This way ZHOR knows how
much fuel you are spending, how much do you still have and other important
information.</p>
<p><b>Can ZHOR send data to my
car’s computer?</b></p>
<p>No. This OBD2 connection is
only for retrieving data to ZHOR, it cannot send data to your car’s
computer(s).</p>
<p><b>Does the mirror function
work on iOS?</b></p>
<p>At this moment we cannot
guarantee that the mirror function will work since specifications of future iOS
can make this function inoperative. On our prototype we were able to see the
iOS device screen, but not interact with it.</p>
<p><b>Is there a jog shuttle to
connect to ZHOR?</b></p>
<p>At the
moment we have not developed a jog shuttle (remote control) for ZHOR. It is
however in our future plans to build one.</p>

<p>Please join our Indiegogo community and help save this automotive art design masterpiece from extinction.  You could own the next BOXX to be built and driven around town!  </p>
<p>DRIVEN.co has obtained the original very first Brubaker Box.  the same car that appeared on the cover of Car and Driver magazine in March of 1972, all the sales brochures, and several movies.  We tracked it down and found it dilapidated and left for dead in a Florida swamp.  We could restore the car like we often do, and see it go into a private collection but we think the BOXX is truly special.  It deserves better.  It should be driven and enjoyed by you, those interested in art design and automotive BOXX aficionados everywhere.  </p>
<p>If you are shy this may not be the car for you.  BOXX draws a crowd and attention everywhere it goes.  Some say that BOXX was the very first true modern mini-van, but  BOXX artistic design almost defies traditional descriptions.  Its quirky utilitarian design was innovative in its day, and has become iconic.  It still looks futuristic today.   </p>
<p>BOXX is a fiberglass body shell kit that fits on an unmodified Volkswagen Beetle chassis after the car's body is removed.  BOXX turns a funky little Volkswagen Bug into one of the coolest cars you could ever possibly drive on the street.  Want to be the center of conversation anywhere you go?...…..then this is your ticket!!</p>
<p>YOU and BOXX?</p>
<p>BOXX is an amazing piece of artistic design that you can use and share.</p>
<p>BOXX attracts attention like no other vehicle.  Put that together with your business or enjoy the roads and shows with something no one else has.</p>
<p>BOXX is built to your personal tastes, by you, or with your kids, or buddies.  Each unique BOXX displays your take on the classic design and your pride of ownership.</p>
<p>BOXX is rare and almost extinct.  Join the team to save BOXX.  Let's get them back on the road, be it electric, hydrogen, 4x4, autonomous driving, or?</p>
<p>That's the gist of BOXX.........intrigued ????</p>
<p>For us geeks, there is a TON of information, history, BOXX future plans to go electric, 4x4 &amp; more.  Dig In !!!</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1562713255/otsbljhjp3sxemfwnish.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>BOXX is a stunning example of artistic product design......rolling art, if you will.   BOXX is a fiberglass automobile body, produced by DRIVEN.co.  BOXX is a tribute to the Brubaker Box &amp; AutoMecca Roamer sports van of which there were roughly 28  produced in the early 1970's.  BOXX can be adapted to fit a wide variety of different power plants and chassis such as electric (EV), hydrogen, hybrid or off road 4X4.  </p>
<p>YES, there is financing!  We have arranged long term financing to fund your project.  With your good credit, you could own a BOXX kit for as little as $239 per month!  <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1562460173/mn1t8prjposwtjmjvpmx.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>The Brubaker Box started life in Southern California and had roots with the renowned Art Center College of Design. Curtis Brubaker's idea was to create a sporty, utilitarian, and safety minded production vehicle.  Designer Curtis Brubaker and his team of Harry Wykes and Todd Gerstenberger, brought the design to life as the Brubaker Box.  The Brubaker Box was released in 1972 to rave reviews and sent shockwaves throughout the automotive world.  Its artistic design was futuristic and unique back in the 70's and this still holds true today.  </p>
<p>Only 3 Brubaker Boxes were ever built.  The company had plans for Volkswagen to provide chassis and drivetrains but the deal fell apart.  Brubaker was forced to close shop after the car made the March 1972 cover of Car and Driver magazine (above), which is the image many people remember.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1562461385/ef07pspvrwkfwwqxldsm.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Mike Hansen, an initial investor in the Brubaker Box, formed AutoMecca to continue to build additional cars. These second generation models were renamed the Roamer Sports Van.   AutoMecca built just 25 more cars before they too ceased production.  </p>
<p>AutoMecca even built and raced an off road racer named the ""Baja Box"" which competed in the Mickey Thompson Off Road Series race at Riverside, CA.  Mike Jr. was at the wheel and Dad riding shotgun.  Mike Jr. told us that because the driver seating position was so far back in the car, the Box was very safe.  That turned out to be a very good thing because one second after this photo was taken, the ""Baja Box"" crash landed on its nose and its racing days were over.<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1562460936/epgbfidgyazvg1pgbjim.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

<p>With so few original examples of the Brubaker Box, high enthusiast demand and their skyrocketing value, BOXX fiberglass bodies make sense.  They allow this tour de force of rolling art, to once again be seen on public streets, to be shared with fellow enthusiasts.  Only 19 examples are known to still exist. so unfortunately most originals sit hidden in garages or languish in collections out of public view.  Since most enthusiasts have never actually seen one in person, BOXX has become almost a mythical item.........a unicorn of iconic artistic design.  <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1562461659/l8atbm8msjrrxl4pphd6.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Many people's first exposure to the Brubaker Box was through movies and TV.  The 1976 television show ""ARK II"" featured a modified Brubaker Box they named ""ROAMER"" for the series. The Roamer likely became the most famous Box, where it appeared to be driven by children and even a chimpanzee.  A Brubaker Box was also featured in the movie ""Grid Runners"".</p>
<p>But perhaps  the most memorable appearance for the Brubaker Box was being featured in the classic movie Soylent Green, a 1973 Sci-Fi thriller set in, interestingly, the year 2022.<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1562461713/zlgxxizylorokmwynsuf.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

<p>Almost 50 years apart.  Curtis Brubaker poses with his creation.   Both of these photos showcase the first streetable Box that he designed and built!!!!</p>

<p>So........why DRIVEN.co?  We have always felt that BOXX was an artistic product design masterpiece that never received its due.  BOXX was ahead of its time.  the time for BOXX is now.  Brilliant iconic product designs change little with the time.  BOXX retains the original flavor and yet adapts to the various propulsion platforms that are becoming available to coincide with our times.  Electric (EV), hydrogen, 4x4, self-driving, vintage vw.  BOXX can be adapted for all.</p>
<p>We've been looking for 40 years.  DRIVEN.CO finally received word of an unbuilt kit that had been languishing in a storage facility since new.  It was incomplete, piled over and inside with trash and junk, but to us......it was a priceless treasure.<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1562462149/aukoj4v6ep1hflfbpw4d.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Once we started to re-create missing parts, we were shocked by the incredible popularity that  the BOXX generated.  DRIVEN.CO began to look into the viability of creating a modern day version of the fiberglass body.  We then found out that lightening can sometime strike twice.  </p>
<p>One of the 3 original Brubaker Boxes that were manufactured had been unearthed in Florida.  DRIVEN.CO found ourselves immediately on a plane flying across the country to rescue another Box.  Indeed, there was a Box that had been claimed by the swamp, sitting out in the backwoods for some 25 years.  We met up with a couple of great guys and were able to drag the Brubaker Box out of its swampy grave.  <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1562462427/g7kvy0inhgee6fjofr5m.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

<p>We have since been able to share ""SWAMP BOX"" at Pomona, the west coast's largest automotive swap meet allowing many enthusiasts their first in person viewing of this dilapidated piece of rolling artistry.  It was heart warming to find out how many people actually remember the Box and meet so many that couldn't believe it actually existed. As is unusual for car shows, it seemed that every age group found the Box appealing and were fascinated with BOXX and it's potential for the future.  Loved by ""techys"", off roaders, the custom crowd and purists alike. </p>
<p>Though we didn't realize it at the time, and after much research, our fondly named ""Swamp Box"" turned out to be none other than the very same original brown Brubaker Box featured on the Car &amp; Driver magazine cover!   DRIVEN.co has built some pretty awesome cars but we've never seen one draw a crowd like BOXX does.  Even in her rough condition, she is a favorite!<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1562526022/ririgzmxwhosmn6kodnp.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Sooo.........Why NOW ?  Well, possession of a Box is high on the list and we finally were able to make that a reality.  We have been doing our homework since then and getting feedback from enthusiasts likely to consider a BOXX kit.  Though most people don't dream of building their dream car, there is definitely a demand for a limited number of BOXX body kits.  When we began to contemplate offering BOXX kits, we noted the qualifications and requirements that would need to be in place to produce a successful project:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Possession</strong>.  Having the physical Brubaker Box in hand allows us do a proper job creating fiberglass bodies.</li>
<li>
<strong>Automotive Experience</strong>.  A very strong automotive background is required to put together a kit that would be simple to build, inexpensive and adaptable to other applications.</li>
<li>

<h3> </h3>
</div></div>","Please join our Indiegogo community and help save this automotive art design masterpiece from extinction.  You could own the next BOXX to be built and driven around town!  
DRIVEN.co has obtained the original very first Brubaker Box.  the same car that appeared on the cover of Car and Driver magazine in March of 1972, all the sales brochures, and several movies.  We tracked it down and found it dilapidated and left for dead in a Florida swamp.  We could restore the car like we often do, and see it go into a private collection but we think the BOXX is truly special.  It deserves better.  It should be driven and enjoyed by you, those interested in art design and automotive BOXX aficionados everywhere.  
If you are shy this may not be the car for you.  BOXX draws a crowd and attention everywhere it goes.  Some say that BOXX was the very first true modern mini-van, but  BOXX artistic design almost defies traditional descriptions.  Its quirky utilitarian design was innovative in its day, and has become iconic.  It still looks futuristic today.   
BOXX is a fiberglass body shell kit that fits on an unmodified Volkswagen Beetle chassis after the car's body is removed.  BOXX turns a funky little Volkswagen Bug into one of the coolest cars you could ever possibly drive on the street.  Want to be the center of conversation anywhere you go?...…..then this is your ticket!!
YOU and BOXX?
BOXX is an amazing piece of artistic design that you can use and share.
BOXX attracts attention like no other vehicle.  Put that together with your business or enjoy the roads and shows with something no one else has.
BOXX is built to your personal tastes, by you, or with your kids, or buddies.  Each unique BOXX displays your take on the classic design and your pride of ownership.
BOXX is rare and almost extinct.  Join the team to save BOXX.  Let's get them back on the road, be it electric, hydrogen, 4x4, autonomous driving, or?
That's the gist of BOXX.........intrigued ????
For us geeks, there is a TON of information, history, BOXX future plans to go electric, 4x4 & more.  Dig In !!!

BOXX is a stunning example of artistic product design......rolling art, if you will.   BOXX is a fiberglass automobile body, produced by DRIVEN.co.  BOXX is a tribute to the Brubaker Box & AutoMecca Roamer sports van of which there were roughly 28  produced in the early 1970's.  BOXX can be adapted to fit a wide variety of different power plants and chassis such as electric (EV), hydrogen, hybrid or off road 4X4.  
YES, there is financing!  We have arranged long term financing to fund your project.  With your good credit, you could own a BOXX kit for as little as $239 per month!  
The Brubaker Box started life in Southern California and had roots with the renowned Art Center College of Design. Curtis Brubaker's idea was to create a sporty, utilitarian, and safety minded production vehicle.  Designer Curtis Brubaker and his team of Harry Wykes and Todd Gerstenberger, brought the design to life as the Brubaker Box.  The Brubaker Box was released in 1972 to rave reviews and sent shockwaves throughout the automotive world.  Its artistic design was futuristic and unique back in the 70's and this still holds true today.  
Only 3 Brubaker Boxes were ever built.  The company had plans for Volkswagen to provide chassis and drivetrains but the deal fell apart.  Brubaker was forced to close shop after the car made the March 1972 cover of Car and Driver magazine (above), which is the image many people remember.

Mike Hansen, an initial investor in the Brubaker Box, formed AutoMecca to continue to build additional cars. These second generation models were renamed the Roamer Sports Van.   AutoMecca built just 25 more cars before they too ceased production.  
AutoMecca even built and raced an off road racer named the ""Baja Box"" which competed in the Mickey Thompson Off Road Series race at Riverside, CA.  Mike Jr. was at the wheel and Dad riding shotgun.  Mike Jr. told us that because the driver seating position was so far back in the car, the Box was very safe.  That turned out to be a very good thing because one second after this photo was taken, the ""Baja Box"" crash landed on its nose and its racing days were over.
Sooooo........why now?   Interest in the BOXX design has only increased through the years.  With retro styling being so popular and world wide resurgence of interest in component cars, the timing is right.  BOXX has the ability to easily adapt to other modes of alternate power sources such as electric or hydrogen, or for simplicity, keep it original, utilizing plentiful and inexpensive VW Beetle components.  Many of the beetle's parts readily transfer over to applications on BOXX.  
With so few original examples of the Brubaker Box, high enthusiast demand and their skyrocketing value, BOXX fiberglass bodies make sense.  They allow this tour de force of rolling art, to once again be seen on public streets, to be shared with fellow enthusiasts.  Only 19 examples are known to still exist. so unfortunately most originals sit hidden in garages or languish in collections out of public view.  Since most enthusiasts have never actually seen one in person, BOXX has become almost a mythical item.........a unicorn of iconic artistic design.  
Many people's first exposure to the Brubaker Box was through movies and TV.  The 1976 television show ""ARK II"" featured a modified Brubaker Box they named ""ROAMER"" for the series. The Roamer likely became the most famous Box, where it appeared to be driven by children and even a chimpanzee.  A Brubaker Box was also featured in the movie ""Grid Runners"".
But perhaps  the most memorable appearance for the Brubaker Box was being featured in the classic movie Soylent Green, a 1973 Sci-Fi thriller set in, interestingly, the year 2022.

Almost 50 years apart.  Curtis Brubaker poses with his creation.   Both of these photos showcase the first streetable Box that he designed and built!!!!


So........why DRIVEN.co?  We have always felt that BOXX was an artistic product design masterpiece that never received its due.  BOXX was ahead of its time.  the time for BOXX is now.  Brilliant iconic product designs change little with the time.  BOXX retains the original flavor and yet adapts to the various propulsion platforms that are becoming available to coincide with our times.  Electric (EV), hydrogen, 4x4, self-driving, vintage vw.  BOXX can be adapted for all.
We've been looking for 40 years.  DRIVEN.CO finally received word of an unbuilt kit that had been languishing in a storage facility since new.  It was incomplete, piled over and inside with trash and junk, but to us......it was a priceless treasure.
Once we started to re-create missing parts, we were shocked by the incredible popularity that  the BOXX generated.  DRIVEN.CO began to look into the viability of creating a modern day version of the fiberglass body.  We then found out that lightening can sometime strike twice.  
One of the 3 original Brubaker Boxes that were manufactured had been unearthed in Florida.  DRIVEN.CO found ourselves immediately on a plane flying across the country to rescue another Box.  Indeed, there was a Box that had been claimed by the swamp, sitting out in the backwoods for some 25 years.  We met up with a couple of great guys and were able to drag the Brubaker Box out of its swampy grave.  

We have since been able to share ""SWAMP BOX"" at Pomona, the west coast's largest automotive swap meet allowing many enthusiasts their first in person viewing of this dilapidated piece of rolling artistry.  It was heart warming to find out how many people actually remember the Box and meet so many that couldn't believe it actually existed. As is unusual for car shows, it seemed that every age group found the Box appealing and were fascinated with BOXX and it's potential for the future.  Loved by ""techys"", off roaders, the custom crowd and purists alike. 
Though we didn't realize it at the time, and after much research, our fondly named ""Swamp Box"" turned out to be none other than the very same original brown Brubaker Box featured on the Car & Driver magazine cover!   DRIVEN.co has built some pretty awesome cars but we've never seen one draw a crowd like BOXX does.  Even in her rough condition, she is a favorite!
Sooo.........Why NOW ?  Well, possession of a Box is high on the list and we finally were able to make that a reality.  We have been doing our homework since then and getting feedback from enthusiasts likely to consider a BOXX kit.  Though most people don't dream of building their dream car, there is definitely a demand for a limited number of BOXX body kits.  When we began to contemplate offering BOXX kits, we noted the qualifications and requirements that would need to be in place to produce a successful project:


Possession.  Having the physical Brubaker Box in hand allows us do a proper job creating fiberglass bodies.

Automotive Experience.  A very strong automotive background is required to put together a kit that would be simple to build, inexpensive and adaptable to other applications.

Quality Resume.  Required to have an established and respected record in the automotive community and experience with rare vehicles and fabrication.  

Strong Interpersonal Business Relationships. Required due to the use of varied parts and suppliers.

Facility. A large, proper facility to conduct business, create products and package for shipping.

Shipping. BOXX is popular everywhere.  Shipping worldwide is mandatory.

Financing for Buyers. Easily affordable is a key value.

Support.  Having the support of the original producers of the Brubaker Box/AutoMecca Sports Van is huge.

Passion and Commitment.  Required to see a project of this magnitude come to fruition.

We submit that DRIVEN.CO can answer an affirmative YES to all of these solid points.  Take a look at  our website: https://www.DRIVEN.CO and our appearance on Pawn Stars 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZheG9PvHXY to see examples of our work.
AND.........DRIVEN.CO must produce these bodies NOW.  Otherwise, this automotive art design masterpiece will unlikely ever be produced.
We knew then that we have no choice but to produce BOXX.  We are absolutely thrilled to do so !!  The first step is to produce the fiberglass body.  We will have options available to suit your needs, ability and budget.  You too, will have the opportunity to own one of the few.  With our financing (OAC), everybody who wants to, can now afford to own their very own BOXX.  Build it to your own tastes and desires!

 Basic -  Complete fiberglass BOXX body, unassembled.  You may construct as per video instructions, or make changes as you see fit.  Included: Fiberglass tub, Roof panel body panels, nose, tail, door, knee dash panel.  This is the basic kit, which requires assembly of numerous fiberglass parts.  Perfect if you are considering modifications or alternative chassis or modes of power.  Please keep in mind that BOXX is a fiberglass body kit...….not an entire car.  There will be time, money and effort necessary to finalize your personalized BOXX.
 
Assembled -  Includes the Basic kit, but the major fiberglass body panels are assembled and bonded prior to shipping.  Similar to the picture shown below, but with some additional fiberglass parts.
BOXX fiberglass body kit, shown suspended over a VW beetle chassis, shown in Assembled form.  VW chassis and drivetrain not included.
Assembled BOXX fiberglass body kit, shows the spacious unique bare interior.


 

 
Option - Door kit -  Includes hardware to install sliding door.
Option - bumper kit.  If you decide you'd like to utilize the original styled wood look bumpers.
Option - component kit - Includes major & upgraded parts for your build; windshield, backglass and trim, LED tailights, perspex side glass and slide channels, gas tank, side marker lights, front sunroof, upgraded pedals, LED turn signal lamps.
Option - Worldwide shipping options are available.  All parts are F.O.B. zip code 90680.
For all kits, you will need to provide your own donor car for BOXX body to sit on, and provide it's power.  You will also need to have various components assembled to your own specifications.  BOXX is a kit, not a completed vehicle.
Stretch goal 1: BOXX set up for 4x4 platform.  on/off road use.  
Stretch goal 2: BOXX set up for EV skateboard platform (electric battery powered, ala Tesla 3 etc.)
 
History and Timeline

At DRIVEN.CO our goal is to exceed expectations with a transparent campaign. 
Hows the money spent ?  
 - Fulfill the BOXX support rewards
- Design and fabrication creating the fiberglass body molds, fit and finish.
- Tooling for the hardware for BOXX.  
- Materials and production equipment for the BOXX fiberglass body
- Labor and overhead cost involved with producing BOXX
- Refurbish ""SWAMP BOX""for  back to original car cover appearance, for its role in the fulfillment of rewards
- Marketing and Indiegogo fees.  
BOXX is a grand undertaking......but one that will save and embellish an artistic legend
Original Brubaker Box, AutoMecca Sports Van sales brochures.
An example of an electric (EV) chassis, or ""skateboard"".  Perfect adaptation for BOXX.
For some of us, the first Brubaker Box was saw was on TV.  The 70's TV show ARKII featured a modified Box named ""ROAMER"".  It was driven on the show by children, and even an ape.
Toyota's new electric GEN-Z concept.  Hmmmmm…...I think I've seen that shape before?
The original ""get into it"" Brubaker Box poster.  Copies are available as a reward.

<h3><u><strong>ScootYa ?</strong></u></h3>
<p>Why we decided to create ScootYa ? Traffic jams, lots of cars everywhere, long waiting for a public transport and you don’t even have a seat there...Would you like to solve these problems and instead of them have some fun ? All these issues have one solution. SCOOTYA !</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.mediafire.com/convkey/62ad/7s7gut7444v21hkzg.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Our main goal is to come up with an affordable product which contains high quality frame and all components. The first idea was based on a saving time. What does it mean ? No more wasted time on charging the batteries. We want to make something more powerful, reliable and last but not least, to reduce charging time. A product was designed by skilled constructors. Every buyer have a chance to make own-designed product. Start it and ride it ! That’s a ScootYa. </p>
<h3>ABOUT - Specifications and details </h3>

<p>Riding a 49cc gas engine is so much fun. It has more than 4 hp (horsepower). Just start, twist a throttle and go for an unforgettable rides. Yes, no troubles with starting a gas engine, scooter got an electric starter, which you can control by pushing a button on the handlebars. It’s so easy.</p>

Unfortunately I had no place to change out of sweat soaked clothes. Then one day, a friend who suffered the same problem, told me he wanted me to make his bike electric. He did not like the available electric bikes and he wanted me to make his mountain bike electric. So, to make a long story short, we spent two years building and rebuilding electric bikes until we developed what we consider to be one of the most practical electric bikes we know of. <b><br/><br/>The Facts:</b><br/><p> There is a huge, little known movement going on in the USA right now. Electric bikes are becoming more popular as more people are seeking 
alternative commuting methods due to environmental awareness and the 
ever increasing price of gasoline. In 2012 there were 70,000 electric bike sold in the USA. Then in 2013 that number doubled to 140,000.<br/></p><p></p><p><b>The Goal:</b></p><p></p><p>The two main problems for people who want to buy an electric bike, are the availability of electric bikes and the high prices. My goal is to build practical electric bikes at a reasonable price. If you compare these bikes to others, make sure you are comparing apples with apples. Check the motor wattage, the batter voltage and battery amp hours (Ah). The cheaper bikes will have lower wattage, voltage and Ah.<br/></p><p>Eventually I plan to build all the parts in the USA (including the 
motors), but to start I must order parts from China. In order to keep 
cost low I must order at least 100 of all the parts. That is why this is
 an ""all or nothing"" campaign. I cannot do this if I cannot reach the 
goal to build 100 bikes.</p><p>To read the full (extended version) of the bike story and to learn more about the team please see our web site. </p><p><a href=""http://www.evtexsun.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.evtexsun.com</a></p><b>Mountain Bikes as Electric Bikes:</b><br/><p>Most electric bikes 
seem to be a choice between style or practicality. The reason we spent 
so much time developing these bikes is that we had to find the right 
balance. What you learn when you convert a bike to electric is that a 
lot of dynamics change. When you pedal a bike you do not really spend 
much time going 20mph. You really need the comfort a mountain bike 
offers.  The mountain bike is best suited to convert to an electric bike
 because
 it offers suspension which makes for a much smoother ride.  
Unfortunately the reasons we love the mountain bikes are also the 
reasons they are not totally practical. When you ride a bike everyday as
 a method of commuting you find that you need practical things like 
fenders. If you hit a wet section in the road or especially ride in the 
rain, then wet underwear become a problem. Therefore, fenders are a 
must. </p><p><b>Our main feature is the battery case:</b></p><p>Really 
the biggest problem is that most electric bikes mount the battery over 
the rear tire. We found that having the battery over the back tire made 
the bike extremely unbalanced. If you ever need to lift the bike, you 
find that it is very awkward since the front wants to fly way in the 
air. Therefore, the main feature of our bike is the battery case. It is 
centered in the frame and low on the bike. It is easy to put on and take
 off of the bike so you do not have to carry the whole bike into the 
office or apartment to charge, and it looks good. </p><b>Practicality - form follows function:</b><br/><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/505400/files/20140413121643-Sport_1.JPG?1397416603"" src="""" style=""width: 466.586px; height: 505px;""/></p>This is the bike I rode everyday, no matter what the weather was.

the batteries will be put in the case by the battery factory, so it will be 100% safe. <br/><br/><p><b>Technical Details:</b></p><ul>
<li>These bikes run 20mph. This is really fast on a bike, if you want to go faster, get a motorcycle.</li>
<li>The bike will go for 1.5 hours on a charge. This is at full throttle or dead stop, no pedaling or any efforts at extended range. Does this mean you will go 30 miles? I do not know as I only measure the time I ride not the miles. I think most people's statistics are highly questionable when they quote range. Have those people who quote that their bikes goes 40 miles actually driven their bike 40 miles? Don't trust those kind of quotes. <br/>
</li>
<li>It takes 3 hours to charge a dead battery. You need to keep Lithium batteries charged. It is bad for the battery to sit for long periods of time without being charged regularly (at least once a month). This is another reason that the battery is designed to be removable and easy to put somewhere to charge. <br/>
</li>
</ul><p><b>Service After Sale:</b></p><p>There is no reason to worry about having trouble with these bikes. I will be happy to guarantee the bike parts for 60 days after you receive them. Problems are rare. However, in case there is a problem, I will have spare parts and will be easily reachable to assist in troubleshooting and repair. The components are all modular and simple to troubleshoot. <br/></p><p><br/></p><p><b>Logo for t-shirt:</b><br/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/507095/files/20140414070042-DSC00849aaa_copy2.jpg?1397484042"" src="""" style=""width: 410.691px; height: 212px;""/></p>This is a logo an aspiring artist did for me when I had a t-shirt screen printing business.

I do not know as I only measure the time I ride not the miles. I think most people's statistics are highly questionable when they quote range. Have those people who quote that their bikes goes 40 miles actually driven their bike 40 miles? Don't trust those kind of quotes. 

It takes 3 hours to charge a dead battery. You need to keep Lithium batteries charged. It is bad for the battery to sit for long periods of time without being charged regularly (at least once a month). This is another reason that the battery is designed to be removable and easy to put somewhere to charge. 

Service After Sale:There is no reason to worry about having trouble with these bikes. I will be happy to guarantee the bike parts for 60 days after you receive them. Problems are rare. However, in case there is a problem, I will have spare parts and will be easily reachable to assist in troubleshooting and repair. The components are all modular and simple to troubleshoot. Logo for t-shirt:This is a logo an aspiring artist did for me when I had a t-shirt screen printing business. No e-bike logo yet, but I think it makes a nice t-shirt picture.  (What I learned from the t-shirt business is that I am a technical person and live for technical projects.)",6.0,0,"4 Campaigns

<h3>DriveHER</h3>
<p><i>First we would like to say, as you may have heard in recent news about UBER supporting Trump, We are NOT like UBER. We are a social enterprise providing a service that believes in representation, and inclusion. We are here to make a difference for a better tomorrow.</i></p>

<p>DriveHER, a start-up based out of Toronto, ON, is a safe and an alternative ride-share service dedicated for women by women. DriveHER is the result of an experience Aisha Addo, the founder, had encountered; and in result of many experiences that came before her.</p>
<p>It was a late night in Downtown,Toronto when Aisha hopped into a cab to make it back home in Mississauga, ON. The driver struck up casual conversation that quickly turned uncomfortable when he began making sexual comments and asking personal questions like whether she lived alone. At that moment, Aisha took the opportunity to create a women-only ride-share service for Toronto and the GTA, to give women an alternative and provide a safe space.</p>
<p>As of January 2017,  we are waiting for the insurance policy to kick in before we get our drivers safely on the road. We are so pleased to know that some of you have already downloaded the app, and some of you have signed up to drive with us. It shows that you care and that yo want to make a difference. With your continuous love and support we hope to not only drive in Toronto, and the GTA, but nation-wide!</p>

<h3>Our Challenge</h3>
<p>In the midst of launching DriveHER we have encountered a road block.  Since we can not operate in the City of Toronto, Drivers will only be able to drop customers off in Toronto but can NOT pick them up in the city. Therefore, the driver must drive out of the city (i.e York ,Halton, Peel &amp; Durham) to pick up a new customer. With that said, this has been the most challenging to recruit drivers and keep interests in registered drivers for our service. The lack of drivers' support results to the lack of ridership, which then means we can not raise the money on our own to operate in the city of Toronto.</p>

<h2>How to contact us:</h2>
<p>General inquiries: contact@goboardup.com</p>
<p>Creator: binlu@goboardup.com</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>FAQ:</h2>
<p><strong><u>1.<u><strong> Will t</strong></u>his come pre-assembled with trucks, bearings, and wheels?</u></strong></p>
<p>Each reward (except the ""REPLACEMENT WHEELS AND BEARINGS"" reward) are pre-assembled with high quality trucks, bearings, and wheels. Once you take it out of the box, it is ready to ride.</p>
<p><u><strong>2. Can trucks, wheels, and bearings with BoardUp be replaced with parts we buy at a skate shop?</strong></u></p>
<p>Yes. You can use standard wheels (75mm X 50mm) and bearings. While BoardUp's rear truck is standard, its front truck is unique to this longboard. The good news is that trucks normally last a long time.</p>
<p><u><strong>3.I don't like the artwork on the back of the longboard. Can you ship me one without the artwork?</strong></u></p>
<p>For a bolder presence, we refined the artwork to be more aesthetically simple. It was carefully designed by a talented artist we knew through friends in the in Bay Area who has a passion for boarding. Over 80% of the backside surface will be the original Canadian maple color. With the same passion and creativity we put into BoardUp, we think you'll love it as is.</p>
<p><strong><u>4.The middle of the longboard where the hinge is seems to bow up. Could you change it to be flat like a normal longboard?</u></strong></p>
<p>We designed it so that, as you ride on campus or through the streets, the hinge won't collide with bumps that you may come across. At 1 1/4"" tall, if the board were flat, this may cause a disturbance in your ride as you run over something below the longboard. That's why we slightly bowed the middle. Friends of ours and professional longboarders have tried it out and they prefer how smooth of a ride it becomes with this feature.</p>

FAQ:
1. Will this come pre-assembled with trucks, bearings, and wheels?
Each reward (except the ""REPLACEMENT WHEELS AND BEARINGS"" reward) are pre-assembled with high quality trucks, bearings, and wheels. Once you take it out of the box, it is ready to ride.
2. Can trucks, wheels, and bearings with BoardUp be replaced with parts we buy at a skate shop?
Yes. You can use standard wheels (75mm X 50mm) and bearings. While BoardUp's rear truck is standard, its front truck is unique to this longboard. The good news is that trucks normally last a long time.
3.I don't like the artwork on the back of the longboard. Can you ship me one without the artwork?
For a bolder presence, we refined the artwork to be more aesthetically simple. It was carefully designed by a talented artist we knew through friends in the in Bay Area who has a passion for boarding. Over 80% of the backside surface will be the original Canadian maple color. With the same passion and creativity we put into BoardUp, we think you'll love it as is.
4.The middle of the longboard where the hinge is seems to bow up. Could you change it to be flat like a normal longboard?
We designed it so that, as you ride on campus or through the streets, the hinge won't collide with bumps that you may come across. At 1 1/4"" tall, if the board were flat, this may cause a disturbance in your ride as you run over something below the longboard. That's why we slightly bowed the middle. Friends of ours and professional longboarders have tried it out and they prefer how smooth of a ride it becomes with this feature.",18.0,4,"1 Campaign

<h3>Wouldn't it be awesome if a plane flew around with a banner reading Ted Nugent is a Pussy?</h3>
<h3>Wouldn't it be even more awesome if excess money raised to fund the plane flight went to a good cause?</h3>
<p>Well, good news, everybody. Together we can make this happen.</p>
<p>Ted Nugent has long used his position as a mediocre buttrocker to make his outspoken political opinions be known. Despite his very eloquently crafted ideology, word is out that the Motor City Madman dodged the draft by crapping his own pants or something.</p>
<p>Thus, I've found a skywriting service that will fly a banner reading ""TED NUGENT IS A PUSSY"" through the air over a city. This kickstarter seeks to raise enough funds for a 1-hour flight ($1100), but if we exceed this goal, we can get a longer flight. It's $1750 for 2 hours, and $2400 for 3 hours.</p>
<p>Excess funds will be donated to anti-gun-violence charities.</p>
<p><br/><strong>You're right, man. This would be totally sweet. How can I help?<br/></strong></p>
<p>Well, for starters, you can donate some money. Any little bit helps get this idea off the ground. But spreading the word about this helps, too! This is fixed fund, so if the project doesn't happen, you get your money back.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Aren't you worried that Ted Nugent is going to sue you or come after you with a crossbow or something?</strong></p>
<p>No. Because I'm not a pussy.</p>

<p>We're excited to bring to Indiegogo our affordable, technology-advanced electric scooter, <strong>the Expresso</strong>!  With your help, we can begin production and add new features to an already amazing scooter. </p>
<p>We're a group of designers, engineers and entrepreneurs who have joined together to create the first affordable electric scooter that provides a viable and fun solution for transportation while helping reduce carbon emissions by going 100% green. </p>
<p>We're dedicated to a long-range plan of creating personal vehicles that are affordable, reliable, meet the needs of consumers, are scaleable sustainable for production. Our first product, the Expresso, is one we've worked hard to create, we've put it through the paces and we believe, you'll love it!  It's Tesla meets Vespa in one affordable two-wheel experience! </p>

<h3>What You'll Get with the Expresso</h3>
</div><div>
<p>We've provided you with multiple options on this incredible scooter. Let's start with the battery. The basic Expresso comes with a traditional lead-acid battery (to keep the costs low). The second option uses a Titanium battery that is removable and charges in two hours. Your third option is an LTO (Lithium Titanium Oxide battery) that charges in 10 mins! </p>
<p>We're also providing you with a mind-bending list of color options. Want to support your school or favorite team? We've got colors to inspire and excite!</p>
<p>To get in on the fun, you can snag an Expresso for under $1,000. Yeah, we said that! Check the perks for details on how you can back now!  (Limited inventory for discounted options)</p>
<p>We're using funds from Indiegogo to create our first round of production and create our SmartDash app to provide you with route info, control music and phone calls AND charge your Smartphone - Android or iOS!</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>We're Already Winning Awards!</h3>
<p>Last year, we were awarded the coveted <strong>Reddot Design Award</strong> for best in product design concept for the Expresso. </p>

<p>We say ""Commuting Matters"" because we believe people deserve more than a mountain bike or road bike for their commute. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Our goal</h3>
<p>Our philosophy is that a commuter bike is more than a way to get from A to B. It should also complement your style. </p>
<p>ONTRO bikes have a unique structure that looks sleek without any compromise to practicalities like luggage space, mud-guards, lights, suspension, transmissions, powerful performance, and battery capacity. Many designer bikes sacrifice this level of functionality for style.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Why Crowdfunding?</h3>
<p>We need your support to overcome the MOQ (Minimum Ordering Quantity) required by factories.  We are a small team with limited resources. Without your support, we won't survive against competition, and ONTRO won't exist.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Pricing</h3>
<p>ONTRO e-bikes have a premium design and are high-quality. Feel free to compare the specifications and price with any other bikes on the market.</p>
<p>We are offering the lowest possible price to Indiegogo backers to get the high volume of orders required to kick-start our business. We guarantee you this unbelievably low price will only be available for a short time.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Is ONTRO worth the few months-long wait?</h3>
<p>An e-bike will accompany you for MANY YEARS. Good things come to those who wait, and your e-bike will bring you delightful experiences. </p>
<p>By supporting ONTRO, you do the following:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Receive an excellent craftsmanship bike that exceeds your expectations</strong></li>
<li><strong>Help an excellent team survive</strong></li>

<p>Hi, we’re ONTRO. As a team of young entrepreneurs and engineers, we’ve been working together since 2015, released our first prototype bike in 2017, and started planning our business launch in 2020. </p>
<p>Our goal has always been to build the ultimate collection of commuter bikes. We saw so many commuter bikes that focused only on style, and sports bikes that focused only on performance. There seemed to be no in between. So we made it our mission to create an e-bike that's strong, stylish, and offers an incredible commuting experience - all at an affordable price. </p>
<p>To make this happen, we tested around 100 bikes with a sample group. We listened to their feedback and continuously made changes until we had an e-bike that lived up to our high standards. </p>
<p>Our philosophy is that a commuter bike is more than a way to get from A to B. It should also complement your style. </p>
<p>That’s why we worked endlessly to perfect the design. ONTRO bikes have a unique structure that looks sleek without any compromise to practicalities like luggage space, mud-guards, lights, suspension, transmissions, powerful performance, and battery capacity. Many designer bikes sacrifice this level of functionality for style.</p>
<p>We often say ""Commuting Matters"" because we feel people deserve more than a mountain bike or road bike for their commute. </p>
<p>Given that commuters make up the majority of cyclists, their needs should be taken more seriously. We want to finally give them the excellent commuting bikes they've been waiting for. </p>
<p>We’re excited to launch our revolutionary lineup of e-bikes on Indiegogo. </p>
<p>Your support will help us overcome mass production barriers, and build the foundation of ONTRO’s future. </p>
<p>We hope you can join us so we can continue innovating the safe and stylish e-bikes commuters deserve. </p>

However, when we enter an indoor space or sweat during exercise, we started to feel too warm, damp, and stuffy. When this happens, it is not so convenient to take the long underwear off in public or to move around with heavy outerwear in hand. We're here to make things easier. We created BASE+ with the vision to revolutionize the concept of everyday wear and layering clothing. Unlike conventional thermals, BASE+ can cut down your apparel, keeping you comfy and active from fall to spring, from outdoor to indoor.We took inspiration from the concept of mountaineering layering and assembled the key elements—moisture wicking, heat regulating, and outer protection—into one design, using the double layer structure to leverage the strength of each textile.HOMI BASE+’s double layer design integrates various features into one piece. The outer layer gives your body the basic protection against the outside world; the inner layer provides everything you want from next to skin clothing; the additional far infrared fabric used in highlighted areas helps improve blood circulation.Taking Thermal Experience to the Next LevelAs shoulders and elbow joints get cold the fastest and heat up the slowest in our upper body, we add an additional far infrared layer to these parts to provide extra protection. It helps strengthen your overall circulation and relax tight shoulder muscles.The far infrared fabric can absorb, emit, and reflect far infrared rays from the human body. The ray can go through the skin to resonate and generate heat, which boosts blood flow and relieves muscle pain. This additional fabric provides extra warmth, optimum thermal performance, and muscle relaxation without disturbing the other features provided by the base layer fabric.Zippered Sleeve PocketKeep your valuable necessities at handBASE+ brings you not only comfort but also convenience. Without disturbing the shirt's silhouette, we added a hidden pocket with YKK zippers to the left sleeve. This tiny pocket is ideal for your essential items, such as cards, wireless earbuds, or bills. It can be very handy when you are on the move! Moisture Wicking & BreathableFeel fresh and clean at all timesDoes your long underwear make you feel stifling and constrictive sometimes? Then try HOMI BASE+. The special fabric used for its inner layer has a similar fiber structure to Merino wool, which performs superbly in moisture wicking and breathability. Our fabric is excellent in dispersing and spreading the moisture out, transporting moisture away and activating evaporative cooling. So when your body releases moisture or perspiration, they will be transported away as vapors immediately, keeping you cool and dry.Thermal Insulating & RegulatingRetaining heat the professional wayOur body temperature changes during and after we exercise, and usually we have to adjust ourselves to feel comfortable by constantly taking off or putting on clothes. Now, BASE+ is here to handle all the work with SUSTAIN THERMO TECH.  Preventing the heat from escaping is the core of SUSTAIN THERMO TECH. In addition to the fine fibers that trap body heat, the double layer structure creates an in-shirt insulation space that retains the warm air, keeping you snug and flexible. Hypoallergenic & Soft TextureNo pesky pilling after washingWe make sure that the inner layer of BASE+ is smooth and sleek, touching your skin gently enough just like your favorite undershirt. The skin-friendly fabric is soft, stretchy, and doesn’t pill. It remains smooth after the wash, causing no itchy feelings.Antimicrobial & Anti-OdorSilver Nano fights against the unpleasantThe excellent wicking ability of the base layer keeps the fabric dry, which already stops the odor-causing factors from thriving. In addition to that, we apply the Silver Nano clothing technology to the outer fabric.Silver nanoparticles reduce the factors that cause undesirable smells by penetrating their cell wall. With this antimicrobial shield, you can walk around feeling jaunty and clean. Wind & Sun Resistant UPF 50+Fewer worries on the roadNo matter if you are biking in the city, running in the evening, or hiking on a sunny day, BASE+ protects your skin from chills and ultraviolet rays. The double layer structure not only provides UPF 50+ sun protection but also blocks mild winds. Quick Drying & Wrinkle FreeYour new favorite daily wearNow you can complete your winter outerwear with the HOMI Heated Jacket! Base+ for your trainingThe special diamond lattice knitted fabric is quick drying, wrinkle free, and won’t shrink or stretch after washing. It will always be sleek and ready for you to put on and head out.BASE+ is a T-shirt that you can wear comfortably from day to night, from fall to spring. And it is durable and easy to take care of! Reflective StripesFunctional adornment for your safetyWhen jogging or biking during nighttime, we often need to pay close attention to vehicles coming from our side. To improve the wearers’ safety, we added reflective stripes to the cuff. The reflection will move along with your swinging arms to increase your visibility from various angles. 365CAP: Triple Layer Cap to Protect Your Head All Year RoundDo you also feel stuffy and sweaty when wearing a hat for a long time? As our head is what we need to protect first when confronting the freezing wind or burning sun, we created a hat that gives you optimum comfort and protection in all kinds of weather conditions.Similar to the design concept of BASE+, 365CAP uses the triple layer structure to insulate the heat and regulate your head temperature, keeping your head sung in winter and cool in summer.

Gamma Jacket is a durable, lightweight, insulated jacket that doesn’t compromise function or fashion. Building on graphene's amazing properties, Gamma is your everyday jacket, your travel jacket, your activewear, and your going-out jacket. Back us today and discover why Gamma is the only layer you'll ever need whether you're hiking the Koʻolau ranges in Hawaii or skiing in the Swiss Alps or biking to work.  Whether you are hiking in the mountains or popping into town for a coffee, the heat-insulating design will warm you up in a matter of seconds. Gamma is the only jacket you’ll need all year round, all around the globe.       Graphene is what makes Gamma unlike any other activewear. Graphene is a nano-lattice - just one atom thick, yet it’s stronger than diamond. Known as “supreme graphene” for its long list of properties and benefits, graphene is the thinnest, strongest, and most flexible known material.   By infusing a graphene layer into the Gamma Jacket, we were able to create a new kind of outerwear. Gamma functions as a winter jacket, a cool-weather jacket, a windbreaker, a rain jacket, and activewear all at once.        While traditional synthetic insulation is the standard, it’s nowhere near the level of warmth that a graphene-infused jacket has. Gamma takes graphene-integrated clothing to a whole new level of modern sustainability and style. Lightweight, all-seasonal, strong, and breathable.  Graphene’s thermal properties have been called revolutionary. It is able to adapt to your body almost like a second skin. Graphene moves heat through its latticed structure, evenly distributing it around your body. In warm weather, it expels heat and wicks moisture to keep you cool.  Graphene conducts heat from your body and Gamma’s built-in heaters and channels it throughout the jacket. In cold weather, it evenly distributes heat to your entire upper-body. In hot weather, it expels heat through its permeable pores.    With Gamma, you won’t have to wear multiple layers or bulky coats. Gamma’s graphene layer will regulate its temperature based on your environment, so you’ll stay comfortable in temperatures from warm to frigid. From city strolls to hikes to snowsports, Gamma will keep you at your ideal temperature.   Gamma is equipped with 3 carbon fiber heating elements built directly into the jacket. When your body heat isn’t enough, you can supercharge Gamma’s graphene layer at the push of a button.  Within seconds, the heaters will begin to warm the jacket, and graphene will distribute the heat to your entire upper-body. Graphene’s thermoregulating properties also ensure the jacket won’t become too hot.  Gamma’s built-in heaters will keep you warm and comfortable even in sub-zero conditions. No need for more layers, even on the coldest days.  Gamma’s heaters are powered by any power bank. Just plug it into the USB-A input in the inner pocket and the jacket will begin to heat up.Combined with graphene's thermoregulating properties, unlike other materials, Gamma will never overheat or ignite. Even if you leave the heater on or fall asleep in the jacket, there is no risk of burns or overheating.Gamma's built in heater comes with 3 adjustable temperature settings that you can cycle through with the press of a button to help fight every kind of cold!    The carbon fiber heating elements won’t restrict your movement or weigh you down. Because the jacket doesn’t contain any electrical parts or batteries, you can machine wash it without the risk of damage.   Gamma contains many pockets, including several hidden pockets, making it practical at home and safe while traveling. Anything you used to stuff in your tote bag can now be stored in your jacket.  Head to the campground, office, or airport with everything you need close to your body with Gamma's secure pockets.   12345   Gamma’s fit is fully adjustable to ensure your comfort and to protect you from the elements, whenever you need it.
Adjustable drawstrings in the hood and waist lock in heat and protect against wind. 
Velcro cuffs and a high neck secure your wrists and guard sensitive skin.
Built-in fingerless gloves to protect your hands without hindering your grip. 
  Tired of heavy jackets and puffy layers? Gamma is the solution. Graphene isn’t just the strongest known material. It’s also the thinnest. At one atom thick, it’s lighter than air—literally. This makes Gamma incredibly lightweight and flexible—perfect for folding, storing, packing, and shoving in your backpack. Traveling with Gamma can save heaps of space in your luggage, especially for minimalist backpackers.   Weighing in at less than 500g (about 1 lb), Gamma weighs as much as the average hoodie. Yet, it can keep you warm as well as a thick winter coat.     Graphene, a material stronger than diamond, can resist almost all forms of damage. It's scratch-proof, puncture-proof, tear-proof, and abrasion-proof. Knives can’t even scratch Gamma, so you can wear it in the toughest conditions.Gamma resists surface wear caused by rubbing or scratching, and it will never scuff or tear. You can expect Gamma to still look like fresh and new after years of heavy use.    Graphene is able to expel heat without letting cold air inside the jacket, so you’ll never feel that sticky, sweaty feeling you get from most shells, rain jackets, and winter coats.Graphene’s semipermeable structure also makes Gamma the ideal jacket for warmer weather in autumn and spring. Gamma will keep you cool when the sun comes out by releasing excess heat—graphene knows when to do this by detecting and reacting to your body temperature.  If you’re using Gamma as sportswear, graphene will pull heat and moisture away from your body, moving it to the outer surface of the jacket and expelling it into the air. When you’re on the slopes, jogging, or ice skating, Gamma will keep you feeling cool while maintaining your core temperature.   Don’t worry about working up a sweat in Gamma. Graphene is 100% anti-odor, meaning no odor-causing contaminants can grow on the jacket.Graphene interacts with sweat odors and neutralizes the smell through ionic conduction, efficiently removing bad smells and neutralizing any harmful substances on its surface.   With Gamma, never worry about your jacket smelling like sweat.  Gamma was built for unforgiving alpine conditions. Combining the naturally wind resistant and water resistant nature of Graphene's compact atomic bonds and our proprietary weave, Gamma is waterproof and windproof. Whether you’re strolling in a light mist or stuck in a monsoon, you can count on Gamma to keep you dry and warm.    Even though Gamma is lightweight and thin, its graphene infused technology is effective up to 50 Miles per hour / 80 Kilometers per hour winds.  Gamma is an absolute must whether you're just road biking or doing some high altitude skiing or hiking.     Graphene is hypoallergenic, meaning it’s resistant to allergens like pollen and mites. It’s completely natural, and it is suitable for all skin types, including people with skin allergies and skin conditions.Graphene is non-toxic, and Gamma is manufactured with 100% non-toxic materials. With carbon as its prime component, graphene is harmless and completely non-hazardous.    Did you know that harmful UV rays can penetrate many light jackets, windbreakers, and raincoats? This can cause burns and skin damage when outdoors for long periods.  Gamma is UV-proof and keeps your skin safe from the sun when you're outdoors.    Graphene repels UV light, also helping you to stay cool in the sun.      Gamma is designed and sized for a comfortable yet slim look. The tailored fit is neither too loose or too tight, creating high flexibility for the wearer. All our sizing and designs are unisex so your sizing may not map. Make sure to take measurements. Sizing will be selected at the end of the crowdfunding campaign through surveys.       The story of Wear Graphene started back in 2004, when graphene was first discovered. Graphene was such a monumental discovery — the strongest and thinnest material on Earth — that it earned its discoverers a Nobel Prize. About 10 years later, scientists first began to understand how to incorporate graphene into fabric. Almost immediately after, the founders of Wear Graphene began to infuse graphene nano-lattice into textiles, creating a new type of smart clothing.

Summer is the best season of the year for camping and having picnics, these are the things everyone loves to do during summer. Enjoying quality time with friends and family, getting closer to nature. In order to protect ourselves from indoor mosquito bites, we normally use pesticide spray or insecticides to kill mosquitos. What if when we go outdoor? How to enjoy a safe and pleasant time without mosquitoes? As outdoor lovers, we have been constantly looking for the perfect solution. Now we found it - the HENGDUAN mosquito repeller! HENGDUAN mosquito repeller is designed with a structure that you can insert the mosquito repellent pad into both sides of the device. You can choose either one-sided or double-sided mosquito repellent according to different situations.HENGDUAN portable repeller uses heat-activated repellent to create an invisible zone of protection from mosquitoes and insects. This device is based on physical principles to heat repellent pads filled with allethrin to bring out the effect of repellent. When the repellent pads are is heated, they release the allethrin and repel mosquitoes. Considering outdoor use, the overall shell material of HENGDUAN is PCR. The PCR material can be recycled to turn industrial waste into industrial production raw materials for mail delivery, realizing resource regeneration and recycling. For a centrifugal mosquito repellent, spray the mosquito repellent on the mosquito repellent pad and the centrifugal fan blows the scent of the mosquito repellent to repel mosquitoes. This method is not very user-friendly and too cumbersome. Also, the repellent range of this method is too small and its effect time is short. Ultrasonic mosquito repellent only targets to repel certain types of mosquitoes but is not suitable for all types of mosquitoes.The repellent range of UV mosquito repellent lamps is too small. It is only suitable to be placed at the entrance but not for outdoor mosquito repellent.However, the application of heat-activated repellent can extend to a larger repellent range. Built-in lithium battery, perfect for portable use. The mosquito repellent pads can be replaced at any time. No additional storage space is required and is more suitable to be effectively used in the changeable outdoor environment. After many times of testing, HENGDUAN has created its exclusive mosquito repellent pads that are far much better than other repellent pads on the market. Moreover, the repellent pads are heat-activated on double sides. HENGDUAN gives you 360° protection.And our products will not dissolve in water, and Chemical composition will not dissolve in the water source to protect the environment!  Camp Mode: Outdoor Mode:In order to cope with different environments and needs, HENGDUAN has two modes ---outdoor mode and camp mode. To activate HENGDUAN,  press and hold the power button for 2 seconds to enter the camp mode and the indicator light turns green. Press the power button again to enter the outdoor mode, the indicator light turns red. Press the power button again to turn off HENGDUAN. The camp mode works for 19 hours when fully charged, and covers a diameter of 10 feet range. The outdoor mode works for 10 hours when fully charged, and covers a diameter of 30 feet range.Mosquito repellent ability test in outdoor environment:  Whether indoor or outdoor, mountain climbing or outdoor camping; HENGDUAN can be easily hung on your body, backpack or even hammock, wherever you want to put it or carry it around with you. A must-have product for home travel and outdoor outings.  With a built-in 9600mAh high capacity lithium-ion battery, you can use HENGDUAN as an emergency mobile power bank. The outdoor power supply is always a big issue. As a team of outdoor enthusiasts, we must take this into consideration. The power output function has been added, HENGDUAN can be reversed into an emergency mobile power bank to charge mobile devices.

<h3>Nice things people are saying:</h3>
<p>""However, I’m now convinced that we’ve reached what I call “peak multitool”, and there’s no getting better or moving forward from here.""-Sarang Sheth, Yanko Design</p>
<p>“Some multitools focus on doing a few things right, while others aim to be more a Jack of all trades. The modular Toler Union is the latter on steroids…”-Nick Lavars, New Atlas</p>
<p>“Talking with Michael from Toler Tools he really pointed out a lot of features that would be super useful…what’s a mechanical engineer left to do but invest a few years of time, lots of savings and build it right!”-Jay Amstutz, COPTOOL</p>
<p>""The OMNILOCK wrench can grab ¼- to ¾-inch bolts, and the UNION’s bit extender lets users fold the multitool out and lay down power.""-Gear Junkie</p>
<p>""The Toler Union may not be the most compact of multitools, but it gives you several full-size tools and better leverage while still remaining pocketable.""-The Awesomer</p>
<p>""Equipped with a self-adjusting wrench, the thing can grip tightly onto different sizes of nuts and bolts automatically, allowing it to simplify your loosening and tightening tasks...it also happens to be a full-fledged multi-tool that you can use for a whole host of other tasks, making it a potential replacement for your everyday multi-tool.""-Coolthings.com</p>

<h3>Our story:</h3>
<p>My wife was running her food truck, The Coop, while I was finishing my degree in mechanical engineering. I had to go and fix things for her regularly, so I began to carry more tools on me, trying to make quick fixes and get back to studying. One day, under the counter working on a leak, frustrated with the nut and bolt prowess of the multi-tool I always carried, the idea for the Omnilock™ began to take shape in my head. I decided to try and design my dream multi-tool, one that could take advantage of the new wrench design to the fullest. I’m very happy with the results, and I’ve not carried another tool since the first UNION™ prototypes were built.</p>

Nice things people are saying:
""However, I’m now convinced that we’ve reached what I call “peak multitool”, and there’s no getting better or moving forward from here.""-Sarang Sheth, Yanko Design
“Some multitools focus on doing a few things right, while others aim to be more a Jack of all trades. The modular Toler Union is the latter on steroids…”-Nick Lavars, New Atlas
“Talking with Michael from Toler Tools he really pointed out a lot of features that would be super useful…what’s a mechanical engineer left to do but invest a few years of time, lots of savings and build it right!”-Jay Amstutz, COPTOOL
""The OMNILOCK wrench can grab ¼- to ¾-inch bolts, and the UNION’s bit extender lets users fold the multitool out and lay down power.""-Gear Junkie
""The Toler Union may not be the most compact of multitools, but it gives you several full-size tools and better leverage while still remaining pocketable.""-The Awesomer
""Equipped with a self-adjusting wrench, the thing can grip tightly onto different sizes of nuts and bolts automatically, allowing it to simplify your loosening and tightening tasks...it also happens to be a full-fledged multi-tool that you can use for a whole host of other tasks, making it a potential replacement for your everyday multi-tool.""-Coolthings.com

Classic Blue won the wote 2. Cup holder add-on3. Ground sheet FEATURES:✅ Seating height like a normal chair (17”/43 cm)✅ Ultra-portable - Folds to the size of a bottle✅ Ultra-light - weighs only 2 lbs/0.97 kg✅ High weight capacity - up to 265 lbs/120 kg✅ Fast & easy set-up - unfolds in <10 sec✅ No assembly - 1-piece telescopic design✅ Extreme durability - anodized aluminum body✅ Ripstop seat with breathable mesh✅ Beautiful high-end look in black or space greyAlso comes with:✅FREE Ripstop Nylon multi-use carry bag✅FREE Anti-slip elastopolymer addon feet✅FREE Aluminium CarabinerWe are a young company based in Copenhagen. We have been developing since 2014 when we launched our very first 100% bootstrapped Crowdfunding campaign and raised 170.000$ for Sitpack 2.0 - the world's first cylindrical portable seat has reached +100.000s of sales globally, and our Sitpack Zen has raised more than 1.000.000$ in crowdfunding. Now with learnings from logistics and production optimization, we're ready for our most ambitious project so far.  This Campaign will give you the chance to receive the ""MacBook Pro"" of Camping Chairs at a fraction of retail price. You can also earn it by getting commission from Sharing - its a breeze to get started and earning 15% on each sale you bring. Just click on the banner below.  The go-anywhere - use anywhere chair. At Sitpack we are all about creating products with multiple usages that are timeless in design and constructed from high-end materials.  Scroll and be amazed about the features and experience of how THREE legs will provide better seating comfort, manoeuvrability as well as giving stability - and sitting freedom.    One-Piece Telescoping Design = Super Easy Set-Up & Take-Down We built a simplistic and minimalistic solution using gravity to unfold, and our own ""one-pull"" locking system, a system only seen on Sitpack products. With a few tries, you'll be a Campster NINJA.  Sitpack has been working with disrupting and innovating compact seating products for more than 5 years.  We are constrained on size, so material choices and brainpower are needed to reach otherworldly features in a fraction of the space and weight showcased by established brands. Features and designs speak for themselves and as we set-us apart from all other brands.Perfect for every occasion. Why sacrifice comfort for portability? Sitpack Campster is much more than a Camping chair. Campster is a social chair, a chair that can be brought anywhere, even used at home as a guest chair. You can easily hook up 2-3-4 or even 8 Campsters together using the free carabiner, to connect the carry bag that is included.  Why make a Chair that looks like every other chair, with standardized components, when you can make something from scratch?  We'll probably because it's easier and more lucrative.But Fuck that, we're doing this to make everyone change their idea on what a portable chair actually could look like. By using beautifully anodized aluminium we obtain a very exclusive look and feel. Another feature that sets our product apart from most other competitors, is our seat which is readily attached to the seat poles making it a multi-functional seat and protection sleeve - for safe carrying if you forget the FREE carry bag.  The seating height (43cm 17"") is a feature not found in ANY other super portable chairs. We researched all portable chairs in the same compact category, and after testing we found huge value in sitting high and packing small.  ""The devil is in the detail!"" What to have the best and easiest portable seat on the market, look no further. Campster is here and will never leave your side. Unless you forget it somewhere. Anyway - we built the chair so it's both compact and easy (even fun) to use.Carry Easily – No Parts to AssembleAll-in-one frame, complete with a ripstop nylon seat to get the seat weight down to 2 lbs & carry capacity up to 300 lbs.Comfortable Tripod SeatOur UniqueThree-legged design allows you to shift and move around easily & stay comfortable.Parks & BackyardsTailgating & Outdoor EventsOne of the most amazing things about Sitpack Campster is its ability to be several products in one.  The seat poles are attached so that they are very flexible to fit all seating needs. You can lean back as on a recliner and soak up the sun, sit-up straight and follow soccer practice, or you can cut your grass with nail clippers, bent forward, still comfortable. As long as both legs are grounded your can tilt, twist and tip as much as you like.  Perfect for Long Hikes & Campfire ChatsSave on space and weight in your backpack. Hook and carry 6 or more! When it comes time to make camp – or even a short rest – Campster clicks open in seconds.  Keep in Your Car for a Road Trip to the BeachSand, sun, and fun are more accessible than ever with a beach chair or several beach chairs that take up only little room in your car.  You might think that the legs will sink into the sand - but think again, ... argh, ok - we couldn't find a super cheap solution for it to hover over sand and dirt - but we will be making a sand-net to suspend between the legs.  Engineered to be the smallest, lightest, and least restrictive portable chair ever, Campster flips the concept of the need for a huge and bulky camping chair to be comfortable. Rocking a seating height that beats that of ALL other portable ""Micro"" chairs - get ready to be amazed. The simple pivoting arms makes for a backrest that will follow you every move, whether you move forward, backward or to the side - as long as you keep your legs on the ground for support, you can move around freely.   And now for the specs:   To begin with, we wanna make it easy for everyone - especially our selves. So the two most popular colors are available.  We might add colors later... But for now, it's a cliff hanger.  It folds up neatly to the size of a 1,25ltr. bottle.  Initial mockup:First and second prototype: Final prototype:if you want happily ever after too...BIG SHOUT OUT TO LUMA CREATIVEFOR OUR AWESOME AND BEAUTIFULLY CRAFTED VIDEO AND PICS click on the logo for more info Return and refund policy:We offer a lifetime guarantee on all our products, but we do not offer refunds, exchanges, or returns for Sitpack products received as a reward unless there is a clear malfunction from the factory. We do not offer refunds, if you have changed your mind, regretted your contribution, or are unsatisfied due to a shipping delay. We use crowdfunding as our primary means of sales as our products are very different from the norm.

The LIVALL EVO21 lets you keep your eyes on the road, instead of worrying what’s behind you. Wide-angle front lights and super-bright 270° rear lights are integrated into the helmet, maximizing your visibility even at long ranges, while smart LEDs signal to drivers what you’ll do next - stop, turn, or ride on through.Plus, three dynamic light effects will make sure you get noticed on any street, improving your safety and helping you ride in style.Get in sync with your cycle. The EVO21 has sensors to detect when you’re slowing down or coming to a stop, and it automatically turns on the brake warning light on the back of your helmet. Letting other riders and motorists know you’re stopping. And keeping you safe and secure, night and day.Riding in the city demands your full attention - and both of your hands. The EVO21’s turn signals operate the same way a car or motorcycle do, with super bright LEDs that signal your turn to drivers at the press of a button.A remote on your handlebar communicates wirelessly with the EVO’s smart LEDs. Letting you keep your hands, and your attention, right where you need them.Cyclists tend to lower their heads to gain extra speed while riding. The problem is, this can reduce your visibility to drivers - even if your helmet has a light.To tackle this challenge, we developed a front light with a 45°reach, so it can be seen even if you’re tucking your head for a sprint. The EVO21’s wide beam light will shine through at any angle, making you visible at long distances and letting everyone know you’re coming. SOS alert systems are nothing new for LIVALL. We’ve been keeping riders safe by perfecting our fall detection and SOS alerts for years. The EVO21 comes equipped with our most advanced and up to date fall detection and SOS technology. It can detect falls anywhere above 1.5 meters, and triggers an SOS alert text message to your emergency contact within 90 seconds of a fall, giving them your precise GPS location. Meaning you can push further on your adventures knowing your loved ones will know exactly where you are within minutes of an emergency.What about a fall where you’re not injured, or if you simply drop your helmet? The EVO’s SOS system gives you a 90-second window to cancel the alert. So you don’t have to worry about false alarms. The EVO21 proven impact management system comes with dual protection systems designed to keep you safe.The first layer is crafted from PC material that spreads the force of a crash throughout the shell, minimizing force and cushioning your head. The second layer of Polysource PSI is a special impact-resistant liner which absorbs the remaining pressure and keeps it away from your head. And the final layer is lovingly crafted out of memory foam, ensuring a snug fit no matter how long your ride. When you’re riding down a pitch-black country lane the last thing you want to think about is your headlights dying. Does 10 hours of battery life on a single charge ease your mind? That’s about a week's worth of commuting for the average cyclist.**It depends on the rider's actual usage. And when we say the EVO21 is a smart helmet, we mean it. Power on once to start your ride, and after that the EVO21 will take over, turning on within 4 seconds each time it touches your head and then powering down once you take it off. So you can forget about power buttons for the rest of your ride.Plus the LED lights feature auto-brightness adjustment that adapts to the road. So not a bar of juice is getting wasted whether you’re riding on dimly-lit trails or bright city streets. A great helmet should offer premium protection without weighing you down. That’s why our engineers designed the EVO21 with the lightest but strongest materials available, to keep it at a feathery 350g while still offering unrivaled impact protection. Keeping you ahead of the pack while protecting your neck from strain.So you can ride longer, and further, in comfort.Cycling to work doesn’t have to mean showing up with sweaty helmet head. The LIVALL is designed to keep you cool while keeping you safe. Intake ports on the brow of the helmet help usher in cool air, reducing sweat on your head and keeping it out of your eyes. Meanwhile, its streamlined profile is designed to help you cut through headwinds and defeat drag, keeping you ahead of the pack. And multiple vents across the helmet channel air to improve aerodynamics and keep you cooler, for longer.Rain or shine. The EVO21 is IPX5 waterproof, so the LED lighting system and remote will run smoothly in any weather.  It passed our rigorous low-pressure spraying testing. The total water volume in this testing is much greater than that of rainstorm days. So the LIVALL EVO21 can not only deal with moderate rain with ease, but also survive heavy rain. However, for safety reasons, we don’t recommend you riding on a rainstorm day.   The iF Design Award is a mark of good design, but the iF Gold Award is even more than that. Winning an iF Gold Award is a 'thumbs up' from the international design jury, it's proof that something truly spectacular has been created. One of only 75 entries that have won a Gold Award from a total of 10,000 put forward from 52 countries, the LIVALL EVO21 design was chosen by a 98-member jury, made up of independent experts from all over the world. With a brand-new appearance and enhanced functions, the EVO21 earned a score of 361/500 in the preselection stage. And won the gold award in one go with a high score of 350/500, well above the winning score of 269.A head-turner in four high-gloss and wear-resistant colors, the EVO21 comes:
Brilliant in black
Proud in purple
Warm in white
Marvelous in mint
So you can look good, feel good, and keep on pedaling.The EVO 21 comes bundled with features aimed at making your life on the road a breeze. Cycling sunglasses aren’t just about fashion. If you’ve ever hit a wasp when cycling 20 km/h downhill then you’ll understand. But they don’t come cheap so making sure they’re safe and secure is important. Our smart helmet comes with a built-in sunglasses holder, so your sunnies are always on hand.All-in-one handlebar remoteWhat do you do when you find yourself in trouble?

There’s no point having a smart helmet if it doesn’t fit. The EVO 21 comes in two different sizes, ensuring your safety no matter your head size.How to measure the head circumference and choose the right size?It's a simple task to measure your head circumference. Grab a measuring tape and place it around your head, mid-forehead just above your ears.

 High-end carbon fiber bicycles are favored on the market. However, when a pure carbon frame has a cycling collision, the pure carbon frame breaks into sharp fragments, which is easy to hurt people and poses great safety risks. To solve this problem and develop materials with better performance and more safety, 3V cooperated with a team of doctors in materials from a well-known university to jointly develop and innovatively introduce aerospace and advanced military grade material - the best combination of carbon and aramid fibers.  After thousands of experiments, the world's first aramid fiber composite bicycle was created.
 
 
Aramid Fiber is usually known as “Kevlar” and is used to create body armors, bullet-proof vests, firefighters uniforms, and a world of other critical equipment that spells safety and strength for those who wear it.  Aramid Fiber is used for its excellent strength-to-weight ratio and heat-resistant properties, offering a shield of protection that is nevertheless lean and lightweight, that makes our unique e-bike exactly that: truly unique! Along with its Aramid Fiber build for extra strength and durability, the 3V Aramid Fiber Electric Bicycle has also been designed for enhanced frame impact resistance and with extra sitting tube toughness, having been repeatedly tested to reliably offer the kind of safety you want to enjoy.   Safety is critical, comfort is essential. That’s why your 3V Aramid Fiber Electric Bicycle has a seat tube built with aramid fiber and fork air suspension to provide effective shock absorption and overall improve your riding comfort. After all, especially when you’re going offroad, no matter how daring your riding adventures may be, you still want to feel comfortable! With a 350W 3-adjustable gear motor, your 3V Aramid Fiber Electric Bicycle equals power, performance and speed. Yep, with this bike, you’re definitely going places!   The battery is obviously the heart of an electric bicycle—which is why we equipped it with a powerful and convenient LG removable 36V battery with a 20Ah cell capacity, offering you a 4 hours battery life and 100km range that you can rely on—with a battery lock function.   This is an e-bike that doesn’t set any limits—on the contrary, it empowers your riding freedom! Featuring the original Japan-made Shimano ten-speed variable speed system, go fast or slow on your own terms!  So what about the tires? Well, whether you want to ride your 3V in the mountains, on the beach, on snowy surfaces, in the city, or anywhere, really, this e-bike is equipped with true all-terrain multi-surface tires that got your back wherever you want to go! The best e-bike calls for the best brake system, right?

We’re passionate about designing travel products that become trusty companions.Introducing The Explorer MAX Toiletry Bag What Is The Explorer MAX Toiletry Bag?Toiletry bags - something you need every single time you travel. We’ve set out to design the best bags on the planet.We know it can be frustrating to buy travel sized everything. It’s nice to just throw in bulkier items like a hair brush, contact solution, a larger sized electric shaver, or even a curling iron. Stay organized, sanitary, & compact.How does all that stuff fit?Two Colors To Pick From1. Click ""Back This Project""2. Pick your reward level3. Want to add more bags/accessories to your perk? Use the Indiegogo add on menu.Jump to our FAQ if you need a more detailed answerThe ProblemMost toiletry bags on the market today don’t offer much organization, are HUGE, or...a lot of times people just default to a Ziplock bag.Shampoo and makeup explosions are the worst. Why should your toothbrush be in the same pocket as stuff like toenail clippers?The SolutionThe Explorer MAX - a super versatile bag with tons of spacious pockets to pack it all while taking up a small footprint in your travel bag.We've obsessed over using the best materials -  we're using our travel tested QuarryPoly. Super durable & water repellant. It cleans easy & you’ll love the way it feels in your hands.Let’s do a quick run throughWater Resistant Toothbrush & Toothpaste PocketKeep debris off your toothbrush and stop toothpaste juices from getting all over your stuff. You know, that gross white residue?After you brush - leave your toothbrush partly out of the pocket to dry or zip it away if you’re on the go.Easily fits an electric toothbrush and travel sized toothpaste OR a full sized toothpaste & regular toothbrush. If you have an electric toothbrush and use lots of toothpaste there’s plenty of room for a full size in other pockets.Three Deep & Tall Mesh PocketsDeodorant, electric razors, combs…& other tall items fit great. This is stuff that we access often so with these pockets you won’t have to rummage.We were able to easily fit items like beard oil, q-tips, flossers, and finger nail clippers.DEEP Water Resistant PocketFit stuff like full sized contact solution, hair brush, larger razors...even a curling iron. This pocket is SPACIOUS - we're shocked how much fits. Store your liquids here to ensure that you don’t arrive to your destination with a shampoo explosion all over your stuff.  Fits up to three Gravel TSA bags. (10” Length x 6” Wide)Stowaway Adjustable Strap with Aluminum G-HookIt’s just convenient to hang your toiletry bag. We built a special pocket on the back of the toiletry bag with a stowaway strap. The g-hook keeps a low profile and allows you to hook this bag onto anything.Now your toiletry bag can hang anywhere or sit great on any surface.TSA Removable & Water Resistant Pouch (One included) Traveling with liquids can be the worst.We included a clear removable, & water resistant pouch for an added layer of protection from shampoo explosions. Quickly pull out the pouch and lay it next to your stuff for easy passage through airport security. We’ve talked with TSA and are proud to say this bag meets TSA's guidelines as a clear scannable liquids bag.Use the silicone strap to hang it up anywhere - it works great as a shower bag also.Three fit side-by-side in the deep pocket. Want a second or third TSA bag? Use the Indiegogo Add-On menu when completing your perk!  SizingOuter Shell QuarryPoly, scratch resistant, water repellant, washes easy, super lightweight...and it just looks and feels great to touch. Sheds water & cleans easily.Mesh We used a Poly & PVC mesh to keep it very washable and durableToothbrush Pocket TPU - waterproof to keep this pocket sealed off from the rest of the bagWeight 13.4 OuncesThe Explorer PLUS & Explorer SlimNo trip is the same. When you need to pack a ton but need an even smaller footprint in your travel bag - three different bags for different travel.These PLUS & SLIM bags are updated to become more lightweight & durable than ever before.Explorer PLUS w/TSA BagThe main difference between the MAX & PLUS is...the deep pocket. It fits a ton and this is a tried/true bag that we've recently updated. The PLUS deep pocket can fit one TSA bag.We also combined two pockets into one for more versatile packing.Explorer SLIMAt 2.2x less volume than the PLUS - this bag is perfect for traveling minimally & lightweight. We love these bags for trips where every inch of space is vital. They pack down thin but still pack all the stuff you'd need to stay fresh on your trips.Explorer SLIM + PLUS v1 vs v2...what's different?

We are super amped to introduce you to our two latest creations! The all-new Taskin Xplorer wheeled convertible & expandable backpack and and the second generation Taskin ONE expandable 9-in-1 backpack.Lets start with the all new Xplorer - A Wheeled Carry-on Travel Bag Without EqualsLast year we launched our first travel backpack and we got a lot of requests for a wheeled version that offered the same style and versatility. Now, after almost a year of prototyping and incorporating all the feedback we received on our original ONE, it’s incredible exciting to roll out the all-new Taskin Xplorer.Well, it is a Taskin.. so it what else can you expect? Taskin's design principles are anchored in combining style and quality with innovative function. And the Taskin Xplorer delivers on all three in spades.  Taskin Xplorer features sturdy wheels and a premium-quality trolley system made of lightweight aluminum, with a telescoping handle that can be set to three positions: 37, 34 or 31 inches from ground.Xplorer is also equipped with a wheel cover, to keep them from touching your clothes when you are carrying it. Because that's never a good look.  Ready to go jet-setting again? Can't wait to get on plane and get away.. we are with you. At 20""/13""/9"" Xplorer is compatible with carry-on size specs for most airlines we know of and the Xplorer should comfortably fit in overhead bins. Even when expanded at 20""/13""/12"" most airlines won't object, especially with the compression straps to hold things tight. So we are ready when you are!Our unique patent-pending backpack straps system allows you to easily and securely store or retrieve the straps within seconds. No need to unhook the straps and push them behind awkward pockets. Did some shopping during your travels? Couldn't resist that navy blue sweatshirt? No worries, you can expand your Xplorer to add another 15 liters and go from having a 30 liter bag to one that can hold 45 liters. Xplorer lets you can fit a lot more than regular carry-on luggage, while staying far more organized.  Carry-on Like PackingOpens wide to make your packing a breeze. 4-Point, Self-Balancing Shoulder StrapsExtra wide shoulder straps that with honeycomb mesh padding featuring our unique self balancing 4 point anchor system. No matter how you like to wear your shoulder bag the straps will re-balance to keep your bag in a comfortable-balanced position.Detachable Hip BeltLugging a lot on your back? Get an assist from your hips with the included hip belt at no extra cost!The hip belt can easily be detached when not in use.. alternatively, it can also be tucked away in back if you think you’ll need them again soon. TSA Friendly Laptop SleeveThe dedicated laptop section features one larger pocket for your laptop and a smaller one for your tablet or notepad. The laptop pocket is 11 x 14 inches and the smaller pocket is 11 x 12 inches in size. The inside of both these pockets are lined with soft velvet to protect your laptop/tablet.TSA/Checkpoint-friendly, 180° lay-flat design allows you to breeze through airport security … well at least compared to most other backpacks.Stove-away Large Water Bottle PocketsNow you see it, now you don't. A neat hide-able mesh water bottle pocket when you need one. Easy-hide Compression Straps PocketsHidden pockets to store away those compressions straps when not in use. No one likes dangling straps.Adjustable Sternum StrapsEasily adjustable sternum straps ensure maximum comfort, no matter your chest size.Front Easy Access Pocket w/ Velvet LiningVelvet-lined, easy-access pocket stores your sunglasses or other essentials.Backpack Strap Easy Access Pocket Easy-access pocket on the backpack strap for tokens, access cards etc.Waterproof External ZippersCustom, easy-slide waterproof zippers help keep the water out (while ONE is water resistant, it's not waterproof—no bag with stitches are) while being easier to pull open.Neoprene Cushioned Top Handle The top handle is made of neoprene so it’s easy on your hands and stays clean. Neoprene is also very durable. We love neoprene.Unisex DesignWill look great on you and your significant other, so make sure you get one for your travel partner, too.  Now let's look at the significantly improved, second generation of Taskin ONE, 9-in-1 backpack.Our backers rated the original Taskin ONE 4.4/5. And most would be happy with that score for a  new product, right? Well not us. After analyzing the missing 0.6 and poring through tons of ideas and feedback, we set out to perfect this most versatile of backpacks with over a dozen new enhancements.Taskin design principles are anchored in combining style and quality with innovative function. And the Taskin ONE delivers on all three room to spare.Let's look at the many key improvements we made to the original designEasy-Gone Backpack StrapsA last minute design change to the straps plus the challenge of collaborating live caused by Covid19 resulted in the original butterfly straps being too unreliable for our standards. So we set out to design a solution that preserved the ease of storing the straps quickly, but in a way that’s far more durable under heavy strain.After evaluating and discarding many design options, we engineered a new, now patent-pending design that allows you to easily and securely hide/un-hide the straps within seconds. No need to unhook the straps and push them back into awkward pockets like most current designs. And no risk of a strap coming loose or being exposed when not in use. Yeah, we’re kinda proud of that one, and we know you’ll love it, too.Hip BeltLugging a lot on your back? Get an assist from your hips with the included hip belt at no extra cost!     Now the ONE features a detachable hip belt that would come very handy, especially when the ONE is expanded and fully loaded up. The hip belt can be attached at two different anchor points to adjust its vertical position depending on your preference.The hip belt can easily be detached when not in use.. alternative it can also be tucked away at the back if you think you will need them soon.TSA Friendly Laptop SleeveTSA/Checkpoint-friendly, 180° lay-flat design allows you to breeze through airport security … well at least compared to most other backpacks.No Loose StrapsWe love dangling straps…said no one ever. The compression straps can now be securely stored in hidden pockets. Every other strap can be secured in their respective pockets/sleeves. Which means when you don't need them, they are out of sight.Stove-away Large Water Bottle PocketsNow you see it, now you don't. A neat hideable mesh water bottle pocket when you need one. Improved design now makes the pocket far studier.Improved Side-HandleWhen you are using the bag in the briefcase mode.. you will appreciate the new improved side handles. The hooks have been redesigned to ensure the straps don't accidently slip out. All hardware is made of new lightweight alloys to reduce weight.Below are just the big ticket items, in addition we made many small improves from new and improved organization pockets, reinforced stitching etc. to truly take ONE from a great backpack to a exceptional one. Backpack Strap Easy Access Pocket Easy-access pocket on the backpack strap for tokens, access cards etc.The 9-in-1 Bag3 sizes x 3 configurations = 9 practical variations for infinite possibilities. Each variation is designed to meet a specific, real-world use case. Spoiler alert: It’s also far more practical than buying a different bag for each. Especially when you get it all with Taskin quality and style.Carry-on SizeIn Everyday and Weekender sizes, the ONE easily passes carry-on size requirements for most airlines. We have travelled multiple times with the bag fully expanded in Voyager and haven't gotten any looks from airline crew yet. Carry-on Like PackingBut you can fit a lot more while staying far more organized.OrganizationBet the Taskin One has more organization options then all the backpacks you own combined :).  Just having more pockets is obviously not enough, so we put in a lot of thought and experimentation into designing the most optimal configuration that will get you the most use out of these pockets.4-Point, Self-Balancing Shoulder StrapsExtra wide shoulder straps that with honeycomb mesh padding featuring our unique self balancing 4 point anchor system. No matter how you like to wear your shoulder bag the straps will re-balance to keep your bag in a comfortable-balanced position. Carry-on AttachmentLugging around a carry-on, well then let it do the heavy lifting with this special carry-on attachment, which secures the One to most standard carry-on handles.Adjustable Sternum StrapsEasily adjustable sternum straps ensure maximum comfort, no matter your chest size.Easy Access Pocket w/ Velvet LiningVelvet lined easy access pocket to store you sunglasses or other essentials.  Waterproof External ZippersCustom, easy-slide waterproof zippers help keep the water out (while ONE is water resistant, it's not waterproof—no bag with stitches are) while being easier to pull open.Neoprene Cushioned Top Handle The top handle is made of neoprene so it’s easy on your hands and stays clean.

To respond to the requests, we launched a crowdfunding campaign here on Indiegogo in 2017 that raised more than $2 million with the support of nearly 7,000 backers. Clearly, crowdfunding launched our brand. Those early backers made it clear that they enjoyed our transparent approach to business and being a part of the process of bringing products to market. We believe that the incredibly vibrant and engaged community that supports us is only possible through the collaborative nature of crowdfunding. Another benefit is improved inventory management which has huge environmental benefits.So, it makes sense that we return to the crowd and all of you for most of our product launches. This is our 4th crowdfunding campaign, and we don’t plan to slow down. We design all Pakt products to last you many years of adventures. To back that up, we stand behind all our bags, including The Anywhere Collection, with a lifetime warranty. This covers manufacturing defects and excessive damage occurring during normal use. Normal wear and tear from everyday use is not covered. We hope your bag is perfect, but if you notice a problem, just let us know and we will work with you to make things right. Manufacturing products is tricky business. We have many years of product development experience and years of business history with the suppliers we currently use. So, we’re pretty good at accurately estimating timelines. That said, there is always the possibility of unexpected delays to any production timeline. If a delay were to arise, we pride ourselves on transparency and quickly updating our customers.The products used in the photos and videos you see on the campaign are our pre-production samples.

<p>Torch Ring uses USB Type C technology and includes a  power cable to charge your light quickly. </p>
<p>One of our core principles is to minimize resources and maximize use in a strive towards sustainable product design. Our rechargeable batteries last for approximately 1000 cycles. A single non-rechargeable batteries (an equivalent CR123A) costs approximately $2 and ends up in the garbage after use. Over the life-cycle of our product you’ll save over $1300 and keep more than 650 batteries out of landfills. Multiply this number by the number of Torch Ring customers and we can make a significant environmental contribution.</p>

It gives you the versatility to illuminate the exact spot you desire leading to a better quality run.  Easy-to-press ButtonTorch Ring is compact yet designed with a big & easy-to-press button. Four Simple Settings 350 lumens - the brightness you want for any situation 175 lumens - brighten up your camp and tent 80 lumens - extend your outdoor adventure Strobe - gain attention and be seen even in the daytime  Efficient DesignTorch Ring uses a constant current driver which pulls current at a constant rate from the battery to power the LED. More current means a brighter light. An LED flashlight without a constant current driver has variable current as the LED heats up and current begins to drop. Lower current means the LED dims with the flip side of increased run times. The graphic below illustrates Torch Ring versus two competitor flashlights. Competitor 1 drops off quickly, but maintains a long runtime. Competitor 2 drops off slowly with time and has a middle ground run time. As a passionate user of our own products, we have aimed to cut through the BS and provide a constantly bright flashlight that does what it says it does. Our time lapse tests confirm Torch Ring is delivering constant brightness.  
Four silicone rings allow adjustment to optimize the fit of Torch Ring to your fingers. With an over sized main ring, Torch Ring downsizes with silicone inserts to fit your finger size. For winter running remove the inserts and Torch Ring will still fit with your winter running gloves.
Use on your left or right hand. Torch Ring fits both hands equally well.
 
Ergonomic weight distribution design
The torch ring is super lightweight. It's as light as 70g.
The light part fits comfortably on your fingers and the battery part fits comfortably in your palm, making it feel lighter than it really is .

 
 

Torch Ring uses USB Type C technology and includes a  power cable to charge your light quickly. 
One of our core principles is to minimize resources and maximize use in a strive towards sustainable product design. Our rechargeable batteries last for approximately 1000 cycles. A single non-rechargeable batteries (an equivalent CR123A) costs approximately $2 and ends up in the garbage after use. Over the life-cycle of our product you’ll save over $1300 and keep more than 650 batteries out of landfills. Multiply this number by the number of Torch Ring customers and we can make a significant environmental contribution.

Special Price Only for INDIEGOGO
Thank you for reading all the way down here! We have a limited special offer only for awesome INDIEGOGO backers. Please take this chance and enjoy your night time activity!  We spent two years developing our concept for Torch Ring, searching for manufacturing partners, optimizing the battery size with LED output, and then adapting our design for mass production. A look at the images below gives an idea of where we started (big and ugly) to where we ended up (compact and stylish). 3D printing services such as Shapeways has been hugely valuable for us to test and tweak our design.  Ever since the birth of his first son (already nine years ago!) Kevin has been a run commuter as he balances work and family. Tomoko is a mother of two children who never wants to give up on running and she finally qualified for the 2021 Boston Marathon. The two of us launched Runbell - a bike bell for runners - on Kickstarter in May of 2014. We met—and then exceeded—our goal, raising $25,000 and attracting almost 700 supporters. Since then, numerous magazines and television shows have run feature stories on Runbell, including the Today Show and The Gadget Man.We are excited to introduce our second invention.Runbell LLCRunbell is a small startup company  based in Oregon, USA.We plan and manufacture unique and affectionate products with the aim of making driving more enjoyable.""Torch Ring"" is our second and latest project.Living in the northwestern United States, where nature is abundant, we utilize the spirit of ""knowing enough"" in our manufacturing. A design that incorporates the functions that are really required as simply as possible. There is honesty and honesty that is not greedy over-engineering.We will earnestly strive to make things, thinking of the days when our products cross the sea far and run through the beautiful cities, mountains, beaches, and bring a joy to you.If you have any opinions or requests, please feel free to let us know.Thank you for your support.",45.0,0,"1 Campaign

 NEW FUNCTIONS!We added reinforced slits on the corners. Now you can use your towel as a sunshade or cloak to prevent sunburns! Created by the PANGEA Backers Club     5 Pouch Bag options. 4 towel color options. Creating 20 different combinations. Mix and Match however you want!   ​       Just cleaning up trash by hand isn’t enough to solve the problem.We need an innovative solution — and we found one that works.The Sungai Watch barriers were developed by a team of European environmentalists and engineers based in Bali. These wildlife-safe devices continuously block and remove trash from rivers, preventing it from washing into the ocean. Each barrier blocks an average of 20t of trash per year!Sungai Watch is a cleanup organization founded by Gary Bencheghib. Their mission is to protect waterways and prevent trash from entering our oceans by placing trash barriers.They include the participation of local children to maintain the trash removal of the barriers. This empowers the next generation to help fight the plastic epidemic and spread sustainability within communities. If this campaign reaches $100,000, you will help us build and place a trash barrier in the most polluted river in Bali. If together we raise $200,000 we can start placing barriers in the Citarum river, the most polluted river in the world! All the trash collected will be classified and audited by Sungai Watch. The data will be presented to corporations, consumers, and the Indonesian government to facilitate political changes against the greatest polluters.All trash will be sent afterward to recycling facilities to be repurposed or composted when possible.Indonesia is the second-largest ocean polluter in the world and the largest contributor to ocean waste per capita. DID YOU KNOW?By tackling the rivers in Indonesia, we make the most effective contribution to prevent ocean waste around the world.  We are an eco-brand and movement founded by Marcos, William, and Juan, three travelers that met backpacking in Mexico in 2018.

The solution was his patented <strong>Suspended Load Technology (SLT)</strong>, which allows the carried load to seamlessly move up and down with respect to the person walking or running. This keeps the load at a constant height with respect to the ground. It looks like magic or computer generated imagery, but it’s science.</p><p><strong>How does it work?</strong></p><p>While standing still, a 50 lb load in your backpack exerts 50 lbs of force (static weight). This changes when you walk or run, where the peak force exerted on you can be up to 3x the weight you are carrying.  Suddenly a 50lb pack can put as much force on the body and joints as if it weighed 150 lbs. With the movement of SLT, this additional force over and above the static weight can be reduced by as much as 86%! For more details, watch the video above. </p><div data-id=""22482402""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://indiegogo-media-prod-cld-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1540251202/uzy2lcsmtr96ggqmvxrv.jpg"" src=""""/></figure></div><div data-id=""22512162""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://indiegogo-media-prod-cld-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1540251202/v1lxe3ed17mvii2jpu2u.jpg"" src=""""/></figure></div><div data-id=""22491478""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://indiegogo-media-prod-cld-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1540251203/viaflmi0gwlggycokot6.jpg"" src=""""/></figure></div><div data-id=""22482409""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><p> </p>

As a biology professor at the University of Pennsylvania and expert in muscle function and biomechanics, Dr. Lawrence Rome, the inventor of HoverGlide was asked by the Office of Naval Research to try to reduce the large loads Special Operation Forces have to carry. The solution was his patented Suspended Load Technology (SLT), which allows the carried load to seamlessly move up and down with respect to the person walking or running. This keeps the load at a constant height with respect to the ground. It looks like magic or computer generated imagery, but it’s science.How does it work?While standing still, a 50 lb load in your backpack exerts 50 lbs of force (static weight). This changes when you walk or run, where the peak force exerted on you can be up to 3x the weight you are carrying.  Suddenly a 50lb pack can put as much force on the body and joints as if it weighed 150 lbs. With the movement of SLT, this additional force over and above the static weight can be reduced by as much as 86%! For more details, watch the video above.  
For more info on the packs and how they work, check out the video below.
 For those who need more space so they can carry more. This pack is on a larger 24” frame. The “Trekker” is our largest model and holds a capacity of up to a whopping 55 liters. Rugged, tough, and ready for the challenge of carrying your gear, this pack is primed and ready for backcountry adventures and  securely holds enough equipment and food for two to three-day trips. Featuring a sleeve that works as a hydration reservoir, as well as thoughtfully designed pockets and zippers, your gear and travel essentials will not only be secure, they will be easy to access no matter where you may roam.
Permits you to suspend up to 50 lbs (more weight can be carried but the pack must be locked)
Hipbelt pockets keep digital devices, snacks, and maps secure and easy to locate
Pockets in the lid keep an insulation layer and other light item organized and accessible
Internal sleeve holds a two-liter reservoir for hydration on the move
Dedicated bottom compartment holds and protects sleeping bag
Harness and hip belt are constructed of closed cell foam covered in  a 3D breathable ""air mesh"" to wick water away  
Nylon ripstop pack material combines durability and lightweight
DWR (durable water repellent) finish protects contents from light rain and moisture
Empty pack weighs only about 9 lbs  
The HoverGlide “Commuter,” “Hiker,” and “Tactical” Backpacks all fit onto the same size frame and can be switched out depending on your needs.              **Please note that The Trekker is only offered on a 24” frame and will not fit onto the 20” frame. There are plans for future bags that will fit on the 24” frame.**  The “Tactical” means business! Ideal for first responders, military personnel and anyone tackling long training runs, the primary purpose of this pack is to lesson the impact on your body even when the stakes are high.  The “Tactical” pack makes heavy supplies easier to carry, especially under more stressful situations that require running, climbing stairs, or other activities that cause heightened physical exertion.
30L capacity sized 
Permits you to suspend up to 25 lbs (more weight can be carried but the pack must be locked)

<p>By backing us on Indiegogo you become part of the team, and the first rule of Team Beach Hub is to create the ultimate beach hub! A big part of getting this is facing the unknowns of the process. As part of the team we want to involve you in this, and for you to be ready too.</p>
<p>You're joining a fantastic team, full of experience and skill and deep beach love. We have veteran crowdfunders, who have delivered $1.6 million of crowdfunded products. We have trusted manufacturers with a completed prototype, able product designers, crack customer experience experts and logistics know-alls. We have planned and scheduled, double checked and underlined.</p>
<p>However, crowdfunding, and product development is a process - it happens in real-time and is subject to chance and circumstance, and we want you to be aware that there may be hitches in the road. We’ve had hitches before, and we’ve overcome each and every one of them, but a packaging error, a part malfunction or a global pandemic - these things can and do happen - and they pose challenges to our project. As part of the team, you can leave all that to us, but do be aware that delays are possible and when you support a crowdfunded project, they can be part of the ride.</p>
<p>We're also backing our product, and your Beach Hub will arrive with a 12 month warranty on all faults. What we can't do, though, is refund your pledge for a delay in the project or if you change your mind. When you back a crowdfunding project you support a process - a way of making a great idea happen - and it's not quite the same as purchasing a product in a shop. We're going to use your support to create the product you see before you, and we're going to do a fantastic job of it, but to do that we need to count on your support in a way that's slightly different from a shop purchase and we hope that - as a part of the indiegogo community - you understand that.</p>
<p>We fully expect to deliver your Beach Hub in time for Summer 2021 and for the duration of the project we’ll be sending you a bimonthly newsletter to keep you updated on where the project is at and where we’re headed.</p>

A handy pocket in the roof of the Hub houses the solar panels, powering two USB outputs which sit neatly in a pocket above the door. Store the power in a battery for later, or use it to power your devices directly - keep the music going, keep the lights lit, and never miss another moment.
**Available as an add-on perk, or as part of the Deluxe Package**

 

No beach kit is complete without a towel, so we've created the world's biggest beach-towel to use as the flooring of your Beach Hub. Ninety square feet of comfort underfoot, stretching from corner to corner of the Beach Hub, with special spot outside for you to lounge on with a drink. This quick-drying, ultra-absorbent, sand-free towel is an essential addition to your beach day.  
**Available as an add-on perk, or as part of the Deluxe Package**

 

There aint no party like a Beach Hub party! Our LED lighting kit contains ten metres of lighting, with special loops positioned around the canopies of the tent so you can cover the entire structure in light. Use the remote control to choose from 365 colours and various effects and get the mood just right - warm sunset glow, winking fireflies or all-out disco party.
 **Available as an add-on perk, or as part of the Deluxe Package**

 

Instant setup can be done by one person in under sixty seconds - all you need to do is release the control strap and unfold the canopies - presto! your Beach Hub is born! If you like following steps then we've included on-tent guidance and if the wind is up then we've got a steps to beat that too, making the Beach Hub even easier and more versatile than you expected.

 

The takedown is the hard part right? Wrong . The Beach Hub has five easy steps baked into its body, and all completed in two minutes flat. These colour-coded guide spots mean that anybody can master the takedown right off the bat. It takes one person around 120 seconds to complete the takedown, meaning more beach time!

 

There isn't a beach tent out there that you can truly relax in - that's why we created the Beach Hub - the biggest instant beach shelter in the world. There's enough space for six people to hang out, it's got headroom to stand up in, twisting room to get changed for a swim, table room for a sunset banquet and plenty of space to just sit back and watch the waves. Size is everything ;-) 

 

Nothing is more important than making sure you’re safe from sunburn and our materials are specially designed with protection from ultraviolet rays. The Beach Hub boosts your seaside safety by blocking up to 98%* of UV radiation. And with four doors, you can always choose the direction of your protection.

 

You don't want to wilt in the high noon heat either, and the Beach Hub is ready to keep you cool as a cucumber. Climate control fabrics maintain the heat in the tent, so you can truly chill out. 

 

Nobody likes a rainy beach, and if you do get surprised by a summer shower then the Beach Hub is the perfect spot to be in, with waterproof fabrics throughout to keep you safe and dry inside.  

 

When it’s time to adventure away from the Hub, you need to be sure that your valuables are safe. Beat the pickpockets with the lock pocket, which comes with two keys, plenty of room, and gives you the confidence to head for the waves without looking back.

 

Ice-cool drinks and fresh food are served courtesy of the built-in cool pocket, which uses multi-layered isothermal foam insulation to maintain the temperature of your food and drink , so you can always reach for a cool one. 

 

Where do you put your wet beachwear? Throw it into into our dry bags and & keep it from soaking your other stuff. The pop open dry bags fold down smaller than a tangerine and are open in second, ready for you to throw in your wet things to deal with when you get home.

Not only are they fidgety AF but with timeless aesthetics, phenomenal ergonomics, uncompromised functionality and unparalleled pricing, the XLs are guaranteed to put your current every day carry, out of rotation. </p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1625399067/trqmzkb0caef5tvxx7o3.jpg"" src=""""/></p><h3 style=""text-align: center;"">OUR STORY</h3><p style=""text-align: center;"">Our foray into EDC started about 2 years ago and since then we managed to put out some stellar pocket knives like the Wraith, Fenrir and Hades just to name a few. However, the crown jewel of our catalog is the Oni which took the mini knife market by storm often making it to the top of many ""best mini knife"" lists. The follow up, Djinn with it's drop point blade furthered our presence in the community.</p><p style=""text-align: center;"">We listened to your feedback and requests and are proud to present to the Oni and Djinn XL. With 3"" blades, Premium construction and great steels, we're confident the Oni and Djinn XL will be a mainstay in your EDC rotation.</p><div style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1626725281/fv1uhmcbpxrpwjkimz8h.jpg"" src=""""/></div><div style=""text-align: center;""> </div><h3 style=""text-align: center;"">DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT</h3><p style=""text-align: center;"">After designing several knives ranging from Titanium frame locks with M390 to value models with D2 and G10, we realized that all but one of our regular sized folders had flipper tabs. While flipper tabs have a unmistakable place in the knife world, the front flipper on the  Oni and Djinn were a dream to fidget with and one of their biggest USPs. We decided to listen to you and offer them with 3"" blades. This makes them legal in most places but still gives you enough blade for even the most demanding tasks.</p><h3 style=""text-align: center;"">BLADE STYLES</h3><p style=""text-align: center;"">The Tanto and Drop point are arguably the ruling blade shapes with the most varied uses. Tantos provide the best design for general utility on a day to day basis. Tanto blades are great at piercing, stabbing, and slicing, making them highly versatile as an EDC tool. Drop points are great for general-purpose use and are also great slicers. Both blade shapes are considered fairly easy to sharpen.</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1625406447/nrnlggr45o4tc650rwp7.jpg"" src=""""/></p><h3 style=""text-align: center;"">BLADE MATERIAL</h3><p style=""text-align: center;"">CPM S35VN is called the ""ultimate mainstream steel"" for good reason. It is truly a top-tier, high-quality knife steel offering superior toughness, wear resistance, edge retention, and machinability for the money.

Not only are they fidgety AF but with timeless aesthetics, phenomenal ergonomics, uncompromised functionality and unparalleled pricing, the XLs are guaranteed to put your current every day carry, out of rotation. OUR STORYOur foray into EDC started about 2 years ago and since then we managed to put out some stellar pocket knives like the Wraith, Fenrir and Hades just to name a few. However, the crown jewel of our catalog is the Oni which took the mini knife market by storm often making it to the top of many ""best mini knife"" lists. The follow up, Djinn with it's drop point blade furthered our presence in the community.We listened to your feedback and requests and are proud to present to the Oni and Djinn XL. With 3"" blades, Premium construction and great steels, we're confident the Oni and Djinn XL will be a mainstay in your EDC rotation. DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENTAfter designing several knives ranging from Titanium frame locks with M390 to value models with D2 and G10, we realized that all but one of our regular sized folders had flipper tabs. While flipper tabs have a unmistakable place in the knife world, the front flipper on the  Oni and Djinn were a dream to fidget with and one of their biggest USPs. We decided to listen to you and offer them with 3"" blades. This makes them legal in most places but still gives you enough blade for even the most demanding tasks.BLADE STYLESThe Tanto and Drop point are arguably the ruling blade shapes with the most varied uses. Tantos provide the best design for general utility on a day to day basis. Tanto blades are great at piercing, stabbing, and slicing, making them highly versatile as an EDC tool. Drop points are great for general-purpose use and are also great slicers. Both blade shapes are considered fairly easy to sharpen.BLADE MATERIALCPM S35VN is called the ""ultimate mainstream steel"" for good reason. It is truly a top-tier, high-quality knife steel offering superior toughness, wear resistance, edge retention, and machinability for the money. S35VN is featured on the top tier models of the XLs whereas the value version features Sandvik 14c28n, a great pick thanks to its high corrosion resistance and edge retention. HANDLE DESIGN AND MATERIALSOni and Djinn XL are available in the following configurations:Stone washed and black Titanium Framelock with Stonewashed titanium clip, back spacer and pivot, stonewashed stainless steel hardware.Black, Yellow and Purple G10 Liner lock with steel liners and stonewashed stainless steel hardware. G10 Backspacer. They also have a Lanyard hole and reversible pocket clip with a filler tab.ERGONOMICSJust like our other knives, Oni and Djinn XL have been designed with you in mind. The ergonomics are unparalleled with no hotspots in any grip. DEPLOYMENT METHODSThe easiest way to deploy the blade is by rolling your thumb over the unique, minimal front flipper tab. The jimping makes this a breeze once you get the hang of it. You can also flick it open with your thumb, index or middle fingers.Small/ Medium glove get a good 4 finger grip. If your hands are a bit larger, you can still maintain a solid 3 finger grip. The spine of the blade also has a harpoon style cut which allows you to choke down on the knife for more demanding tasks.The Titanium version features a deep carry Titanium pocket clip and a lanyard hole (not on prototype) The Liner lock version features a reversible deep carry pocket clip with stainless steel filler tab (not on prototype) as well as a lanyard hole (not on prototype) SPECSBlade thickness: 3mmBlade Length: 3”Cutting Edge: 2.7″Handle length: 4.3”Over all length: 7.3”Bearings: Single row ceramicClip: Deep carry, Reversible (Only on Liner Lock)Total weight: Approx.  5.3 Oz (Titanium), 4.3 (G10) Lifetime Warranty BONUS MODELS!We took this opportunity to bring back the Oni with new and improved handles along with 3 brand spanking new blades.SPECSBlade Material: Sandvik 14c28n.

~ WITNESS THE STRENGTH OF OUR SMART TRAVEL KNOWLEDGE BELOW ~

 

 

 
Keeping your cell phone powered up is one of the most important things during your travels, but it’s not easy without readily accessible power sources which is often not guaranteed. Luckily we really care about your journey and we integrated into SkyTrek Smart Luggage a Removable Power Source for you to charge your electronic devices whenever you want.
SkyTrek's Removable Power Source doesn’t fall afoul of any airline regulations by being easily removable and handily pocketable before going through any security screening.

SkyTrek's Removable Power Source has 8000 mA*h of charge and can support your SkyTrek Smart Luggage technology continuously for 15 days, standby for 1 month, and recharge an iPhone X completely 2 times (it only needs 2 hours to be fully charged itself).
 
You'll find that it gives you a new sense of freedom, especially in how easy it is to remove this rechargeable power source by simply flipping open a protective cover and ejecting it. SkyTrek has 2 Front Pockets to let you quickly access your frequently used gear; for example the 26-inch SkyTrek's larger bottom front pocket is suitable for up to 14-inch laptops; and the 20-inch Carry-on front pocket is suitable for up to 13-inch laptops. The top Small front pocket can be used to handily store passports, tickets and documents, freeing up your clothing pockets or reducing the need to have an extra bag for such items.  About our locking mechanism for the front pocket, user just simply turn the button to lock the front pocket. With this construction the front pocket won’t be opened up by accident or during transit. We also make the the button with rips for easy grab.  As many road warriors know, having a wrinkle-free business suit or outfit gives you that much more confidence in your meetings and travel alike.  You'll be glad to see that SkyTrek's Garment Hanger helps you to keep things neat and wrinkle-free. You can also hide this innovative integrated hanger by rotating it out of the way to save space when you don't need it.  SkyTrek's adjustable space helps you maximize the benefits of being flexible and catering to your real demands of travel. It provides a personalized way of using your luggage and lets you customize how your interior space is used.In addition we thoughtfully included a Waterproof Bag for your toiletries, a Padded Bag to protect your electronic devices and a Regular Packing Bag to keep things tidy. You are able to take these well-designed and multi-functional bags out separately and use them independently any time.   Nothing is more awkward than squatting down and opening your luggage at the airport in front of strangers. With SkyTrek Smart Luggage, you can handily open your suitcase even when it’s upright with full privacy because of the specially designed storage covers included. As a busy traveller, we know your work and creative inspiration can arrive at any moment. When it does, you can quickly use SkyTrek Smart Luggage as your Mobile Work Station with the top, flat surface turning into a great platform for a cup of coffee, a desk, a meal table, or just simply to put your feet up comfortably! Luggage is often lost during transfers and luggages without tracking have a much lower chance of being quickly located and recovered. Most other smart luggage also can't be tracked because their sole battery source has been removed during the flight compliant with regulations.For SkyTrek Smart Luggage, apart from the removable battery source, there is also a miniature integrated NI-HM battery that complies with airline regulations and is used to keep the SkyTrek Smart Luggage solution functioning for up to 3 days when the main battery source is removed. This integrated backup battery will be automatically recharged by the main removable battery when inserted into your SkyTrek and you don't need to worry about charging one more battery separately. 1,600,000 pieces of luggage are lost every year so you can see how important it is to have a reliable way to track your luggage. SkyTrek‘s extensively tested global tracking system adopts 3G + Wi-Fi + GPRS network connections to narrow down the luggage location as effectively as possible so you will always know precisely where it is. Simply open the SkyTrek app on your phone and click ""Location"" and you will know where your luggage is.   No one wants to remember passwords and neither do we at SkyTrek! Our Smart Lock has an integrated fingerprintID system and is powered by SkyTrek's dual battery system, so simply put your finger over the reader and open your luggage. You can also unlock your luggage through the SKyTrek app that supports iOS TouchID / FaceID as well as Android security unlock methods.  Note: We use Bluetooth operated TSA lock on 26'' luggage instead. The user can unlock and lock the 26'' luggage through our APP on their smartphone by fingerprint ID or Face ID. Have you ever paid extra fees for your over-weight luggage?  With SkyTrek's cleverly integrated weighing solution, you'll always know the weight of your luggage every time you travel! All you need to do is open the SkyTrek app, select ""Digital Scale"" and then lift you luggage by top handle and the luggage weight will show up on your phone. Forgetting things is normal and sometimes we just need a little help or a gentle reminder.  The SkyTrek Smart Luggage solution comes with an Anti-Lost Alarm that makes forgetting your luggage in a taxi or leaving it behind a thing of the past, invisibly tethering your phone to your SkyTrek luggage for safety through adjustable proximity sensor technology.  To join our referral program, simply follow the steps below and share SkyTrek to your family and friends:1 - Share the link with your family, friends!2 - Simply email contact@skytrek.info mentioning your friend's name!3 - You'll get one point from each of your successful referrals!",56.0,2,"1 Campaign

At DIVEROID, we thought of bringing the convenience of having a smartphone always on hand, with the technology of monitoring your dive. Our product includes a dive computer, compass, and logbook all in the palm of your hand.
 
 


 
 
 A Diving computer is an essential piece of safety equipment, especially for your first dive. It prevents accidents by measuring the depth, dive duration, and the ascending speed. DIVEROID is the only existing dive computer with an all-in-one solution. Our colorful and high contrast app displaces all the necessary diving information you need such as depth, dive time, ascending time, and temperature at a glance.    DIVEROID’s safety alerts will notify you at any time during your dive if you have reached your depth stop, or are ascending too fast. In the case of an emergency, our app will let you know what to do at the current depth you are at to stay safe.  
   DIVEROID alerts let you know you have reached your safety stop. An alert will pop up when it is time to stop. Additional DIVEROID features include: 
Tilt Compensated 3D Compass 
 Your Real-time Diving Profile
  You already have a high-quality functioning camera in your hands...your smartphone! Capture endless photos and videos of your dive which can be shared later on via link through the DIVEROID App.

 
   The DIVEROID housing device protects your phone underwater while fully allowing you to use your phone with the simple button operations on the device.*Disclaimer: Some features such as the ultra-wide-angle, zoom, selfie and 4k video quality only works on supported smartphones*   The deeper you dive, the less light you will see thus the less color is reflected. That’s why most of underwater pictures and videos are blue or green. To fix this, you may have to use a red lens filter on your camera. We make this possible with our algorithm. It makes the real-time color correction function restore your pictures automatically to the original color.    * Notice: In order to watch this video in optimal quality, we recommend using Chrome browser which supports 4K resolution. Other browsers such as Safari may not support 4K resolution for Youtube videos.The video was taken with an iPhone8 in 4K mode. Don't forget to select 4K as a quality option!   Are you tired of keeping track of your dive log by pencil and paper? DIVEROID keeps track of your entire dive, from start to finish at a glance. The app auto-syncs the photos and videos taken on your dive for you to, later on, look back on. You can view the specific photo taken at each depth of your dive. 

   Your logbook can be shared with others by link via Social media, text message or email. The person who you shared the link with, can see your complete logbook on their web browser.       Customize with stickers your diving story and share your dive with your friends, family, and others via SNS, Text or email.    DIVEROID  is compatible with almost every major smartphone in the market today.  DIVEROID has an inner housing adjustment so you can fit your smartphone perfectly in the device. The universal buttons on the outside are for easy use and accessibility of your phone during your dive. Can’t find your device? No problem at all! Search for your smartphone to check out its compatibility!   [Important NOTICE] - Android UsersThanks to your help we were able to check the compatibility of various smartphones for our app and found serious issues on Huawei, Xiaomi, Oppo and Oneplus which are all made in China. Basically, smartphones produced in China are very difficult to optimize for they have highly customized ROM that we cannot fully access.Camera functions are too unstable and not even working for some models. We can't even figure out which models have problems as it occurs intermittently. For example, we found a serious issue on Huawei P20 pro, but some backers who are using the same phone reported that it worked just fine. So you must test our app on your smartphone beforehand.However, even if you can't find any issues on this test, we can't guarantee that it’ll stay perfectly compatible in the future because smartphones produced in China are continuously updating in unpredictable ways which may create new tricky issues.Sure, we can run further tests and fix the problem, but we don't know if we can fix it completely and how long it’ll take. We don't want you to take any risks using it.  
 


 
 

   We go through a strict water pressure chamber, closed water test and an open water test procedure with our devices to ensure that the best performance and resistance are met.   Only the best of the best materials are used to make DIVEROID to ensure you the best, and safest diving experience every time.  DIVEROID has five ‘Heat sink™’ drains which release the heat so it prevents fogging inside the housing.
  
  DIVEROID had a double O-ring structure built in the housing with a 60M/200ft waterproof functionality.    We make DIVEROID devices with only the top tier materials like Gorilla Glass™, for strength and scratch resistance, and Polycarbonate with Glass fiber for high strength and durability.   DIVEROID supports free diving mode with features including depth alarm, stopwatch for static apnea, and even convenient boat calling straight from the app.  

 
    DIVEROID has all the information freedivers need, including depth, dive time, water temperature, and surface time reach. 

 
   Control your dive with depth alarm features that can be set for up to 6 different depths. These settings inform you of the current depth of the water you are in.    Need to call a boat to pick up you? With DIVEROID, you can now call a boat all through the app with DIVEROID’s boat calling function. A text message will be sent with your exact location in google maps via url and make the call to the boat. 
    Train your body to stay underwater longer. You can record for how long you can hold your breath and challenge to your limits.         Your freediving logs are recorded automatically in the App with photo synced to depth.   
       When CEO & founder, Jungil Kim saw the need for a more affordable, dependable, modular solution to scuba diving computers. Ever since then, Diveroid has been in the making to ensure the best possible computer diving device.   CEO & founder, Jungil Kim is an experienced diver of more than 10 years. We started with the profound knowledge and experiences in underwater activities, technology, and entrepreneurship. The first product we launched was DIVEROID Android, the all-in-one dive gear. We included a dive computer, compass and dive logbook into a single device. The DIVEROID Android is the only existing dive computer with built-in housing.

Comment acheter DIVEROID
    Buying a diving computer, compass, and camera separately for your dive can get pricey over time and not to mention they are very bulky and can weigh you down while diving. At DIVEROID, we thought of bringing the convenience of having a smartphone always on hand, with the technology of monitoring your dive. Our product includes a dive computer, compass, and logbook all in the palm of your hand. 
 ※ THIS IS BLACK VERSION
 
 
 A Diving computer is an essential piece of safety equipment, especially for your first dive. It prevents accidents by measuring the depth, dive duration, and the ascending speed. DIVEROID is the only existing dive computer with an all-in-one solution. Our colorful and high contrast app displaces all the necessary diving information you need such as depth, dive time, ascending time, and temperature at a glance.  ※ THIS IS BLACK VERSION
 
   DIVEROID’s safety alerts will notify you at any time during your dive if you have reached your depth stop, or are ascending too fast. In the case of an emergency, our app will let you know what to do at the current depth you are at to stay safe.  
  ※ THIS IS BLACK VERSION   DIVEROID alerts let you know you have reached your safety stop. ※ THIS IS BLACK VERSION
 An alert will pop up when it is time to stop. Additional DIVEROID features include: 
Tilt Compensated 3D Compass 
 Your Real-time Diving Profile
  You already have a high-quality functioning camera in your hands...your smartphone! Capture endless photos and videos of your dive which can be shared later on via link through the DIVEROID App.

 ※ THIS IS BLACK VERSION
   The DIVEROID housing device protects your phone underwater while fully allowing you to use your phone with the simple button operations on the device.*Disclaimer: Some features such as the ultra-wide-angle, zoom, selfie and 4k video quality only works on supported smartphones* ※ THIS IS BLACK VERSION   The deeper you dive, the less light you will see thus the less color is reflected. That’s why most of underwater pictures and videos are blue or green. To fix this, you may have to use a red lens filter on your camera. We make this possible with our algorithm. It makes the real-time color correction function restore your pictures automatically to the original color. ※ THIS IS BLACK VERSION   * Notice: In order to watch this video in optimal quality, we recommend using Chrome browser which supports 4K resolution. Other browsers such as Safari may not support 4K resolution for Youtube videos.The video was taken with an iPhone8 in 4K mode. Don't forget to select 4K as a quality option!   Are you tired of keeping track of your dive log by pencil and paper? DIVEROID keeps track of your entire dive, from start to finish at a glance. The app auto-syncs the photos and videos taken on your dive for you to, later on, look back on. You can view the specific photo taken at each depth of your dive. 

   Your logbook can be shared with others by link via Social media, text message or email. The person who you shared the link with, can see your complete logbook on their web browser.       Customize with stickers your diving story and share your dive with your friends, family, and others via SNS, Text or email.    DIVEROID  is compatible with almost every major smartphone in the market today.  DIVEROID has an inner housing adjustment so you can fit your smartphone perfectly in the device. The universal buttons on the outside are for easy use and accessibility of your phone during your dive. Can’t find your device? No problem at all! Search for your smartphone to check out its compatibility!  ※ iPhone 12 mini is NOT compatible   [Important NOTICE] - Android UsersDue to software issues we discovered that some smartphones were incompatible. We recommend that you cancel your pledge(s) if your smartphone is listed below. Our sincerest apologies for the inconvenience.[NOT compatible] * This chart will be continuously updated as we receive the test results.Since there are a plethora of smartphone models, it's difficult for us to test all of them. If you think your smartphone fits diveroid based on size measurement, feel free to buy one and try it. If you find out the diveroid app doesn’t provide compatibility with your device after the actual product delivery, you can ask us for a full refund including delivery fee.But still, if you are missing your device from the compatibility list, it’s hard to assure compatibility since we don’t have your device.
 

   We go through a strict water pressure chamber, closed water test and an open water test procedure with our devices to ensure that the best performance and resistance are met.   Only the best of the best materials are used to make DIVEROID to ensure you the best, and safest diving experience every time.  DIVEROID has five ‘Heat sink™’ drains which release the heat so it prevents fogging inside the housing.

  DIVEROID had a double O-ring structure built in the housing with a 60M/200ft waterproof functionality.    We make DIVEROID devices with only the top tier materials like Gorilla Glass™, for strength and scratch resistance, and Polycarbonate with Glass fiber for high strength and durability.   DIVEROID supports free diving mode with features including depth alarm, stopwatch for static apnea, and even convenient boat calling straight from the app.  

 
    DIVEROID has all the information freedivers need, including depth, dive time, water temperature, and surface time reach. 

  ※ THIS IS BLACK VERSION
   Control your dive with depth alarm features that can be set for up to 6 different depths. These settings inform you of the current depth of the water you are in. c  ※   ※ THIS IS BLACK VERSION  Need to call a boat to pick up you? With DIVEROID, you can now call a boat all through the app with DIVEROID’s boat calling function. A text message will be sent with your exact location in google maps via url and make the call to the boat. 
  ※ THIS IS BLACK VERSION
    Train your body to stay underwater longer. You can record for how long you can hold your breath and challenge to your limits.      ※ THIS IS BLACK VERSION    Your freediving logs are recorded automatically in the App with photo synced to depth.    
   When CEO & founder, Jungil Kim saw the need for a more affordable, dependable, modular solution to scuba diving computers. Ever since then, Diveroid has been in the making to ensure the best possible computer diving device.

<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">HOW IT WORKS</h2>
<p>In addition to the<strong> </strong>four edge wheels, the Freebord has two additional<strong> </strong>center wheels on the board’s centerline that rotate 360 degrees. The center wheels are slightly closer to the ground than the edge wheels.  This is what simulates the base of a snowboard allowing riders to initiate slides in any direction, check their speed or stop like they would on snow.<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.freebord.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/bently-follow5.gif"" src=""""/></p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""> </h3>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">EDGE CONTROL</h3>
<p>By positioning your weight over the board's edges you can carve deep turns.  Shift weight to the base, and—just like a snowboard—it slides, allowing riders to check speed, navigate tight terrain, drift a 180 into switch or come to a complete stop.  <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.freebord.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Bently-Stop-.gif"" src=""""/></p>

The motion of sliding a Freebord is different from a longboard or traditional skateboard because unlike kicking out a power slide, sliding on a Freebord is about shifting weight from edge-to-edge. Just like snowboarding, you can apply more pressure on an edge to control your stopping power. The Freebord 5-X was designed to replicate the feeling of snowpack underneath your board.  OUR HISTORYSince 1998, we have always stayed true to the progression of our board. We don’t make false claims about being the absolute best snowboard simulator. These are simply facts that have been proven year-after-year by a worldwide rider base of avid snowboarders.We have customers who report back saying that they rode black diamonds on their first day of snowboarding. There are countless others who are simply happy to keep their snow legs fresh all year long. Whether you're getting ready for the next season or just trying to keep the momentum going, picking up a Freebord is the way to go.    
 
HOW IT WORKS
In addition to the four edge wheels, the Freebord has two additional center wheels on the board’s centerline that rotate 360 degrees. The center wheels are slightly closer to the ground than the edge wheels.  This is what simulates the base of a snowboard allowing riders to initiate slides in any direction, check their speed or stop like they would on snow.
 
EDGE CONTROL
By positioning your weight over the board's edges you can carve deep turns.  Shift weight to the base, and—just like a snowboard—it slides, allowing riders to check speed, navigate tight terrain, drift a 180 into switch or come to a complete stop.  

  

Our goal is to bring Freebording to neighborhoods around the world. After 20 years of doing business, we are excited to bring to life our vision of snowboarding the streets. We believe in being a rider owned and operated business and need a strong community of riders, supporters, and backers of this project to make this dream of ours come true. Get your lift ticket for life by backing this project and ordering the Freebord 5-X. We look forward to catching you out on the streets! ~Freebord Mfg.

Altair’s Reel Box Tube adjusts to allow a rod to be 17 inches in length from the front of the reel to the butt of the rod.Altair doesn’t fit big game conventional anglers’ rods or deep sea bait casters, only regular-sized bait casters. Altair mounts to any car or truck roof rack and looks amazing. Other fishing cases and racks look bulky or take away from a vehicle’s look. Altair’s minimalist, matte black exterior and sleek design are aesthetically pleasing on every vehicle and add a sexy look of stealth and ruggedness. Each rod carrier comes with a set of mounting brackets that will fit almost all standard roof rack crossbars. Hardware instructions will also be included, making installation a breeze.Altair is built to last. It’s constructed of strong plastic and aluminum with a durable powder coat finish.The Reel Box Tube, Middle Tube and End Tube are all constructed of a light-weight, strong aluminum. We chose aluminum because it’s extremely durable, yet lightweight—features you want in a roof-top addition.The Reel Box itself is made of glass-impregnated nylon for strength, and it effortlessly slides on the aluminum. Even the mounting brackets are fully metal so they won’t break down over time!Altair’s sexy end cap is secured by a keyed lock so your valuables are never vulnerable on the road.Arriving at the spot with a fully-setup rod means you’ll be rippin’ lips faster, otherwise you'll only be catching a couple.No need to swap rod carriers on your roof rack or be forced to transport a rod in the car because it’s not the same “style” as the kind your current rod case transports.Altair lets you get more time on the water when you want to visit different spots on the same day. Simply stack 2 or more Altairs and you have different style rods rigged and ready to go.Having multiple Altairs means you can securely transport your buddy’s rod with zero hassle.Packing up for fishing takes enough effort and space. Add accommodating kids and just getting to the spot becomes a chore. Safely stowing your rods on the roof gives everyone more space in the car and decreases the chance of damaging a rod.Road trips mean your car will be stuffed with gear. Keep your poles secure and easily accessible on your roof to save space and get hooked up faster.Nothing takes it out of you like a long day on the water. Altair lets you skip de-rigging and get on to a hot meal and rest.Hi, we’re Dan and Brandon.We’re fishermen, and together, we make Talos Outdoors. The core purpose of our company is to earn money while providing valuable products and services, and with Altair we stay true to that value. We both started fishing (conventional) from a young age, and got into fly fishing as adults. Like most, we fell in love with the solitude and challenge that comes with fishing, and quickly explored many different styles.As gear junkies, we’re willing to try any and every fishing gadget, and after trying multiple rod cases, we realized most are geared for fly fishing. Knowing personally that most anglers use different style rods, we recognized a large market was being overlooked. That’s what led us to create Altair. It’s the perfect solution for anglers that do different styles of fishing and may not want the initial big expense to carry their buddy's rods for them.We chose crowdfunding to bring Altair to the market because it makes sense for our small  business. Instead of taking the risk of outside investment, we let our customers show us the value of our product by placing an order and being the very first to enjoy the seamless experience of fishing on arrival. But that’s not all. When you back this campaign, you get your Altair for a heavily discounted price.‘Backing’ us on this Indiegogo campaign simply means you place your reservation for Altair once production is complete. You’ll get email updates about production progress and delivery so you know how close your Altair is to arriving at your doorstep.At the end of the campaign, we’ll send you a survey to get your shipping information and deliver your Altair when manufacturing is complete!BS in Business, MSA.

I am a father of three children and the founder of TEDS. During my life, I have always enjoyed camping. In my late 30s, I came across some personally difficult times, and things were not working out. I took that time to spend more time with my family, and we decided to spend some time camping across New Zealand. We covered most parts of the country camping out in various types of rooftop tents. Spending time out in nature with loved ones truly helped me look back on myself and mentally secure myself to think and plan out my next steps. I wanted to share the experience and the feelings I had felt during camping with as many people as possible. After returning, I gained experience in the industry as a technical designer and soon started drafting my own original rooftop tent design.</p><p> </p><p>TEDS is now proud to present “TEDPoP”: a pop-up rooftop tent that will not only give you a great camping experience but also allow you to continue connecting and bonding with your loved ones wherever you go.</p><p> </p><p>We have many plans and products coming up, and your support will help us bring them to life.

Lugging it around while it’s packed up can be quite a hassle and pitching it usually ends up being way more complicated than it should be.TEDPoP makes sleeping off the ground super easy and convenient. Just unfold it and you are ready to go! After you install TEDPoP once, you can use it to camp whenever and wherever you want!  TEDPoP offers an enormous space allowing up to 5 people to lay down comfortably at once due to dual expandable panels on both sides of the tent.It offers a non-obstructed 360°all-around view that is generally not possible in the case of expandable rooftop tents due to their structure.Since there are 2 entrances, you can change the direction of the tent entry to any side that you prefer as well.Windows on all sides create an openness that exceeds regular closed-off tents.The “Star View” ceiling window opens up a beautiful view of the sky and stars.  TEDPoP’s tent skin material is applied with a high-density canvas fabric to maximize air permeability. Along with that, a fly material equipped with features complementing the canvas skin is used simultaneously to block UV and demonstrate perfect waterproof qualities.The super water-repellent premium canvas is a material newly coming to the fore in the tent industry and is a fabric used to draw oil paintings. Because it’s an excellent moisture absorber, you won’t have to worry about condensation forming inside the tent. As a material with self-waterproof features, it boasts durability that withstands even the strongest rains with ease.   One of the annoyances commonly experienced in typical camping tents is “condensation.” This refers to the phenomenon where the differences in indoor and outdoor temperatures cause the vapor in the air to turn into water drops within the tent. This process occurs frequently in general polyester material tents and gives a hard time to campers in hot or cold weather conditions.To solve this problem, TEDPoP has adopted a newly developed insulation method. By utilizing an insulated closed-cell structure with maximized insulation, we’ve drastically minimized condensation, which was a fatal drawback of existing products. We have also developed the world’s first thermally static composite panel (3 layers in the picture below) and are currently in process of getting a patent. The panel improves temperature-resistant stability while fundamentally blocking the persistent condensation of other rooftop tent products.Additionally, boosting air permeability by applying the high-density premium canvas fabric as the tent skin material has played a huge role in wiping out condensation as well.  The exterior with a streamlined form that resembles a clamshell is crafted in an aerodynamic design. Such design structure minimizes wind resistance and is not only safe to use in strong winds, including typhoons, but also helps with fuel efficiency and noise while driving.  TEDS has opted for ABS material instead of FRP used in average tents, embodying the pro-environment aspect, and at the same time, has grafted a condensation-preventing technology by applying insulating layers.Ref. FRP (Fiber Reinforced Plastic): Despite being plastic, this is a hybrid material made with a compound of various materials and is completely unrecyclable, which has become a major cause of environmental pollution and has led the recent related industries to drop its use.In addition to these features, the high-strength aluminum honeycomb panel doesn’t alter its shape, even when faced with a weight load of 2000lbs. This is thanks to it utilizing the same material which is used to make aircraft wings, meaning that it’s adapted for resulting in maximum durability.  When you raise the cover to a certain height, the expanding force of the condensed gas strut bar increases, causing the hard shell to open automatically. Following the opened hard shell, the extension panels on both sides consecutively open by the movement of the link structure.Most hardshell rooftop tents on the market were optimized for a smaller group of people, from 1 to 4 people maximum. However,  TEDPoP allows up to 5 people to sleep comfortably inside. This is achieved through dual expandable panels that extend from both sides of the main panel. However, adopting such a structure would lengthen the cantilever as much as the extended panel’s length, hindering the tent pitching, and the moment arm would also be lengthened, possibly becoming a shaky factor in durability aspects including stability and load capacity.The highlight of TEDPoP is that in order to overcome this obstacle, we have divided the extension panel to both ends of the main panel, and by reducing the moment arm, we facilitated high stability and even the convenience of a pop-up.    TEDPoP is available in white and black colors. At the end of the campaign, we will send you a separate survey where you can select your colors.  ""Dark Wine Red"" is the basic color of TEDPoP that you will receive.At the end of the campaign, we will send a separate survey from which you can choose other custom colors as shown in the picture above.***Please note that other custom colors aside from ""Dark Wine Red"" will only be available if there are 50 or above selections for that particular color based on the results of the survey.     All rewards will include the following:1. TEDPoP Rooftop Tent x12. Telescopic Ladder x1 (2.3m)3. Mounting Bracket Set x14. Tension Pole5. High-density foam mattress (thickness: 2.5"")6. Ladder Cover7. Allen Wrench8. Gas Strut Locks9. Keys x210. Instruction Manual11. Fabric Care Card Stand-alone S-Annex is a new generation of Annex that was designed specifically for TEDPoP. - Can be used as stand-alone Annex for extra space without support of rooftop tent. After setting up TEDPoP and S-Annex, you can pack up TEDPoP and enjoy your trip without having to go through the hastle of packing up the annex as well. Later you can dock your TEDPoP to S-Annex with ease! - Possible to install an Annex on either side of TEDPoP for enormous living space that you can make use of.S-Annex Shipping: TEDPoP backers: If you back our S-Annex, we will ship it for free along with your TEDPoP.Non-TEDPoP-backers: We will ship your S-Annex for an extra delivery fee of 45 USD. Please note that shipping fee might change depending on your country.  Our rooftop tent comes with 1 ladder that you can attach to the desirable entrance and if you’re looking to add an extra telescopic ladder in order to make use of both entrances, consider getting this extra add-on.Need extra storage for your stuff?

We spent months looking into various rooftop tents that are out in the market, especially on what kind of improvements can be made for a better user experience.Our conclusion is that common issues such as condensation and comfortability can be improved through better materials and enhanced designing, and the loss can be lowered by cutting out all unnecessary costs.Ultimately, we are confident that we can provide everyone who not only enjoys camping and Overlanding but has an interest in outdoor activities the best camping experience through our product. The starting point for this IndieGoGo is not limited to this rooftop tent but will be the beginning of a full line-up of products that are currently in design.Our team is fully committed to this IndieGoGo campaign. We’ve spent nights and days working on this project and tested every possibility to deliver the best product in your hand. With the final prototype, we made sure everything is on the perfect track for mass production. Now, we are ready to manufacture and ship them out to you.   Why INDIEGOGO?My name is Ted Ko. I am a father of three children and the founder of TEDS. During my life, I have always enjoyed camping. In my late 30s, I came across some personally difficult times, and things were not working out. I took that time to spend more time with my family, and we decided to spend some time camping across New Zealand. We covered most parts of the country camping out in various types of rooftop tents. Spending time out in nature with loved ones truly helped me look back on myself and mentally secure myself to think and plan out my next steps. I wanted to share the experience and the feelings I had felt during camping with as many people as possible. After returning, I gained experience in the industry as a technical designer and soon started drafting my own original rooftop tent design. TEDS is now proud to present “TEDPoP”: a pop-up rooftop tent that will not only give you a great camping experience but also allow you to continue connecting and bonding with your loved ones wherever you go. We have many plans and products coming up, and your support will help us bring them to life. Your support in bringing this project to life means more than anything to us, and we wholeheartedly believe that we will be able to offer the experience and the feelings that we have felt and let you keep fulfilling your expedition dream.  If the product has a defect caused by our manufacturing side, free exchange is available for 1 year.For failures from the problem of the product itself, free after-sales service is offered for 2 years.  Risks and challengesWe understand that many of our backers start planning for trips when they back our project. We have been talking with global distribution companies and partners for months to make sure your “TEDPoP” reaches you on time. Our plan and goal is to start delivering the product to your doorstep from November. If you come across any questions or issues related to “TEDPoP”, please feel free to reach out. We will be standing by to get back to you as soon as possible and make sure you continue to feel connected with us. Also, we will regularly release update posts and e-mails so you will always know the status of your product. TEDS is trying to do its part during these difficult times. When hiring, we have employed people in difficulties due to the Covid-19 situation first, and this will continue as long as necessary. As soon as we start the mass production, we will open much more positions and try to help as many people as possible to overcome this hardship together.",58.0,4,"1 Campaign

Please bear with us as we try to coordinate the shipping process. Thank you for your patienceSupply is limited and the next production batch will not commence until February 2021. Preorder now while there is inventory.Dam coolers is an outdoor company with a fun attitude and innovative approach to creating.Our flagship product is our Hard Cooler which uses Vacuum Insulated Technology to keep its contents much colder for longer periods of time, while being lightweight and lower profiled to give a lean look. We like to describe it as Efficient, Versatile and Practical.Or as we say at DAM Coolers; Light.Tight.Right.This same ethos is embodied by all our other products. Our extremely useful Soft Coolers and our 2-in-1 Backpack cooler shout out those three words in every aspect of their design. 




Focusing on performance and real value we made our hard coolers injection molded and not roto-molded - This lends itself to the efficiency in the design and manufacturing process which you will see that our pricing reflects.


Using advanced Vacuum Insulated Panel technology we get a lot of performance while maintaining plenty of volume in a small package, the kind of oomph and space you will not see in more expensive coolers.50% thinner walls or more, and up to 25% more volume!Since the early days of the first portable coolers, there have been all sorts of insulation material used to help them slow down temperature change. Sand, Foam, Down, Gas and Polyurethane (Roto-molded coolers) are a few. Some are better than others, but they all have their downsides. From hygiene to environmental impacts to weight, bulkiness and cost.Our patented patent pending design uses Vacuum Insulated Panels. It is a form of thermal insulation whereby a gas-tight enclosure surrounding an insulation material has all the atmosphere within it evacuated.Vacuum insulation technology significantly reduces molecular movement of the air between gaps, reducing heat transfer by conduction (via contact), convection (via diffusion) or radiation (UV light and other wave forms). Because of this they have about one-fifth the thermal conductivity of the best conventional insulation and thereby 5 times the thermal resistance per unit of thickness.With Ice Retention being the number one driver in the high-performance cooler market, it was a great opportunity to develop a cooler that met and outperformed the competition.  The idea of DAM Coolers was born!The cooler is also designed to be simple to use. Unique to DAM Coolers is the upside down D-Latch system, made to be ergonomic and easy on the wrists. Each time you bend down to grab a drink you will be greeted by a smooth, unique looking, easy to handle grip that you pull up towards you with 2 fingers supporting the lid with your thumb and then out,  to reveal your treasure inside.We set our cooler against the latest and the greatest for a 'head to head' ice retention test several times and it always performed extremely well.Here is our latest result.In a “Full to the Brim” ice test in temperatures between 80 and 115 degrees, with an average of about 87 degrees,  the DAM 25 was able to hold solid ice for over 6 days.This simple test monitored how well each cooler maintained cold temperatures and how quickly each reached equilibrium.Now most of you won't be out in the wild with a cooler with no access to replacement ice but if you were, be rest assured that the DAM25 is your No. 1 choice for a compact, well organized cooler to take to the outdoors. 


 


The SOFTCOOL15 is the smaller of our two soft coolers. 
The SOFTCOOL20 is the larger of our two soft coolers with some added mobility and some cool additional features: 







The demands of everyday calls for a durable backpack dedicated to just that. 
Our 2-in-1 Cooler Backpack is a combined 50+ liters of thoughtfully designed storage to keep you organized, and still be comfortable enough to wear on any commute.  

 
DAM Coolers was started in 2016 as an idea between a couple of crazy students who just wanted to get the best grade in a school project.Once we got the idea, we knew that we had stumbled upon something BIG, such that before finishing we were already making real business plans.We gave it all we had, we even started gluing together stuff and 3D printing parts ourselves in our garage until we made our first prototype.Our first DAM Cooler performed so well that there was no turning back from that point on. We also got ""The Most Likely to Start a Business"" award, and did just that!We started DAM Coolers, LLC and here we are today.        The design and engineering for  our first two hard coolers are completed.

Your next companion for your everyday adventures — mix & match 7 unique sections to create the ultimate bag for any occasion.
 
 

                   Going on a weekend getaway? Take a section out. Off on a safari? Add a few. Tego adapts itself to you, not the other way around.  What you carry is as unique as your fingerprint - so we created pockets for everything. Tego comes with seven sections to start, but we won't stop there! Let us know what types of sections YOU'D like to bring on your adventures.Tall skinny items fit in a variety of elastic pockets and loops. Liquids go into a waterproof compartment. Cords go around wraps that keep the ends separated. Big items like deodorant and chargers can go in mesh pockets or two zippered pockets.It still handles toiletries effortlessly, but now, it fits everything else YOU carry...mascara and bike tools, dongles and dog toys, chargers and cables, utensils and stencils, spices and devices.    Seven sections (for now) that you slide together to create hundreds of carry options for your stuff.  327 to be exact.  Every section has a slide on one side and hooks on the other so you can create the perfect bag for any occasion. And just to make sure they are as durable as the rest of the bag, we tested them 5,000 times. Each Tego also comes equipped with YKK zippers (because they last forever).            The Tego Travel Kit received rave reviews, with overwhelming demand for a new, improved third generation for everyone to use.              All plastic bottles used for production have been through the entire consumer usage process.     If you are reading this, you probably want to know why you should trust me to deliver the Tego Adventure Kit. Well, the biggest reason is because this is our THIRD Kickstarter project.  This project incorporates everything we learned from shipping our first two Kickstarter products to 5000 backers and customers around the world. Tego all the feedback we received from the backers and from the invaluable 35 Tego Testers, who have spent hours with us dissecting their experience with our products. I can’t wait to see Tego change the lives and ease the routines of people everywhere.    I like to make things. The biggest thing I’ve made is an airplane (Van’s Aircraft RV-8). Yeah, the kind you get in and fly. I flew it all over our beautiful country - mostly places where taking tools along is a pretty good idea. Somewhere along the way I found getting smacked in the face by a floating wrench really hurts. That’s when I fell in love with tool rolls.  The pockets keep everything organized and it's easy to see if you’re leaving a wrench buried in the grass. A few years later, frustrated with every Dopp kit I've ever had, I made one for my toiletries. Then a few friends asked for one, then a few more and now, 5,000 customers later, it’s gotten a little out of hand.  As we grow, our focus remains on building products that invite adventure, and building relationships with our customers that drive the designs of our products to new heights. Let’s roll!       We are able to ship worldwide. VAT and GST not included. Please see reward for details on the shipping cost that applies to you. We plan to ship starting in FEBRUARY 2022*. We will keep you up to date on our progress and the expected delivery date of your order. *Actual ship dates may vary. We will keep you notified of your product ship date. By backing now, you’ll get to own one of the very first products off of the line, plus exclusive access to provide valuable feedback that will shape future generations of the product.     These shipping charges are based on our expected volume and could increase or decrease slightly. The shipping charges shown are the estimated costs PER Tego Adventure Kit. Multi-pack purchases will receive discounted shipping rates.    Like what you're seeing? Want to help? Just 30 seconds of your time could make the difference in growing the community.
