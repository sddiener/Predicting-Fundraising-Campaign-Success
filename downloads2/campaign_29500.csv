<p>After working for six months as an intern in remote villages in Northern Peru, Rishima faced the reality of receiving an education in remote areas. She was surprised to see how early children dropped out of school,  some as young as 5 years old. This was due to a variety of reasons including a lack of basic educational resources, unqualified teachers in rural areas, the need for children to help parents, the cost of education (it is not free in Peru), the distance to travel to school, and not seeing school as relevant to their lives. </p>
<p>However, Rishima did observe the powerful and lasting effects that a quality sustainable education program could have within the community. There are dedicated parents and teachers who want the best for the children and community, but at times poverty was just too strong a factor in preventing this. </p>
<p>Every child should have the opportunity to receive a quality education to reach their full potential for <b>free</b>!</p>

</div></div>","Our Story  Rishima, the founder of Sol Community Education Society and a Canadian teacher, started Sol Community Education Society to improve the wellbeing of children and their families living in global poverty through education and community engagement. 
After working for six months as an intern in remote villages in Northern Peru, Rishima faced the reality of receiving an education in remote areas. She was surprised to see how early children dropped out of school,  some as young as 5 years old. This was due to a variety of reasons including a lack of basic educational resources, unqualified teachers in rural areas, the need for children to help parents, the cost of education (it is not free in Peru), the distance to travel to school, and not seeing school as relevant to their lives. 
However, Rishima did observe the powerful and lasting effects that a quality sustainable education program could have within the community. There are dedicated parents and teachers who want the best for the children and community, but at times poverty was just too strong a factor in preventing this. 
Every child should have the opportunity to receive a quality education to reach their full potential for free!

What Sol Does
Sol has been providing workshops to various villages in Norther Peru for the last three years. We were finally able to establish a small permanent school to provide education classes in the village of Las Dunas in January, 2015. Las Dunas is a village on the outskirts of the City of Piura, in Northern Peru. 



Classes are conducted three times a week on values education, self esteem building, heath education, literacy, and more


The classes are for children aged 0 - 12.  

We have held workshops for the last 3 years in 3 villages!

The families in Las Dunes mostly work as taxi drivers, retailers, in agriculture and cattle. There is low literacy and school attendance due to lack of income, access, and however, there is a strong drive by the parents of Las Dunes to make a better life for their children. They are dedicated to provide the best opportunities for their children. 

    The Impact  This program enables the children of Las Dunas to get much needed support in literacy, numeracy, health education, and values education (i.e. self esteem/confidence building).
The ripple effect of education benefits the whole village including confidence in parents, neighbours, and eventually the children's children! 
There are no community centres or schools close by for the children to attend, so this program provides a place for children to go to and learn.

This program has been running successfully since January and we would like to support it long term and eventually have the program run daily.



What We Need 
A dollar goes far in Peru. It costs only $170 per month to run the program.
Here is where your donation goes:

Provide a qualified teacher for over 60 children for a year
Provide resources and supplies for the children for a year
Build a better future for the children of Las Dunas!
If we exceed our goal, it will go towards expansion of the program!

</div>","This magazine is going to serve language teachers, new and old,
the pupils and the parents at Waldorf schools by sharing acknowledged ideas,
interviews, methodology questions, and last but not least enthusiasm.
Based
on a survey we conducted among teachers at Steiner schools, a quarter of the language teachers at
schools in any given year are
new. We
have already received many articles, practical
examples and pictures from teachers around the world. Actually a
whole magazine is almost full.

The
Impact

 We are sure that the impact in the long term will be an increase in
the foreign language knowledge of our pupils, who will be really able to read,
speak, write and understand the foreign languages they have been learning from
the first class on.


We hope that the fluctuation of language
teachers will be reduced (at the moment about 24% each year!), when teachers
are more aware of the background and teaching methodology of our schools and
get help from each other

<p>Training Centre:</p>
<p></p>
<p>We will be offering computer training classes, afterschool

technology in the various aspects by building upon what they are learning in
school. We will have the ability to teach students at various levels allowing
them to learn at their own pace.</p>
<p>Additionally, we will also provide students with the online
tools to continue the learn experience on their own.</p>
<p>Kids will be taught various programming languages such as Scratch,
HTML/5, CSS, JAVA, PYHTON, RUBY ON RAILS, PHP to name a few.</p>
<p>They will be taught about Linux and Windows environments, working with Ras
Pi’s, programming robots and various projects encouraging innovation.</p>
<p>Our future goal is to open a section of our space as a computer
lab and offer access to the computers based on membership, like a library where
kids can come to work on various projects together.</p>
<p>Kids will have the ability to use a 3D printer and 3D pens,
along with other tech gadgets teaching them to think outside the box.</p>

CONNECTECH is Bermuda’s first technology incubator, a much needed technology training centre for youth and entrepreneurs to become innovators in the community. CONNECTECH provides training and co-working space for startups and people interested in advancing in the tech industry.
COMMUNITY, EDUCATION AND INNOVATION
Our website is coming soon www.connectech.bm


We believe that a thriving innovative entrepreneurial community is being formed in Bermuda, and that the local economy benefits from the formation of innovative small business when they are supported. The inventors and makers that may change the world require access to the tools, teams and training to make their ideas a reality.
CONNECTECH believes that educating our Bermudian youth, who will be the next generation of innovators is an important step in creating a prepared and empowered future workforce and community.  
Our training centre will focus on computer training, programming and coding skills for the youth of Bermuda, with the vision that collaboration amongst startups/entrepreneurs and tech students will encourage innovation for our technology industry and Bermuda as a whole.
At CONNECTECH members and visitors will be able to book
resources online from a host of full services for hot desks, offices, meeting
rooms and computer resources, or just hang out in the member’s TECH lounge
while enjoying lightning fast internet, refreshments in a community
environment.

CONNECTECH also offers seminars and workshops on hot
tech topics from industry experts for all age groups, such as; Tips to starting
your business, Hands on tips for Building Your Website and Shopping Cart solutions,
Social Media, Driving traffic to your site, Web and internet security… plus
many, many more.
We provide an environment that encourages the elements that foster innovation.
Here, the barrier to entry is lowered and the playing field is made less rocky
through training, access to experts, authentic networking opportunities, and
events that offer promotion and exposure for our members and their
businesses. 

People come together at CONNECTECH to learn, share ideas, co-develop products,
work on a passion project or startup. 

Training Centre:

We will be offering computer training classes, afterschool
and Saturdays to youth (primary students initially). Kids will learn about
technology in the various aspects by building upon what they are learning in
school. We will have the ability to teach students at various levels allowing
them to learn at their own pace.
Additionally, we will also provide students with the online
tools to continue the learn experience on their own.
Kids will be taught various programming languages such as Scratch,
HTML/5, CSS, JAVA, PYHTON, RUBY ON RAILS, PHP to name a few.
They will be taught about Linux and Windows environments, working with Ras
Pi’s, programming robots and various projects encouraging innovation.
Our future goal is to open a section of our space as a computer
lab and offer access to the computers based on membership, like a library where
kids can come to work on various projects together.
Kids will have the ability to use a 3D printer and 3D pens,
along with other tech gadgets teaching them to think outside the box.


CONNECTECH Co-Working Space Offers:
· 
Hot desks (open space), some desks are fully equipped with
computers while others will allow you to connect using your own computer. 
· 
Private office space, meeting rooms with conference features and
a large training center and seminar space available by the hour, day, week or
month at affordable prices.
· 
High speed lightning fast internet and printing available.

For a basic
     membership you can come relax in our TECH Lounge.
Complimentary
     coffee, tea, water and snacks are available to all our members.
Operational hours
     are currently from 9:00am-6:00pm, as we grow with your help our hours will
     expand.

Working around others who are starting businesses, launching
campaigns, working as freelancers, inventing new products and shaping the
future of Bermuda’s innovation economy is inspiring... get out of the living
room and into a community workspace!

Our goal is to have a fully operational computer centre for kids/all to walk in and use computers to create and innovate. Similar to a library where they have a membership to hang out and read the books, at CONNECTECH they will be able to hang out, innovate, collaborate and code.
Our campaign goal is $30,000, which will enable us provide students and entrepreneurs alike with the tools needed to innovate, educate and collaborate.

Here's what your contributions will provide:
With your generous contributions, you will be supporting the
growth of students interested in technology, fostering an environment that
encourages entrepreneurs to create and develop business opportunities. 
 Assist in the purchasing the latest technology tools that will be
available at CONNECTECH. Provide more computer equipment and access to create a
‘computer library’. These are our goals so you can see how your funds will go
to assist CONNECTECH.

<h3>'The Ginger'</h3>
<p>Following the loss of her 20-year-old son Connor, also affectionately known as ‘The Ginger’, in January 2014 to Melanoma, <i>The Melanoma Coalition</i> Co-founder &amp; President Tracy Mehaffey Cockerham felt an overwhelming need to do something that will drive towards the eradication of this awful disease. Her 25 years of experience in the private sector, as well as her devotion as a Melanoma advocate and a mom, lead to the founding of <i>The Melanoma Coalition</i>.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1466539539/xt3pp5nrgeuf4oh1aeb5.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>The grieving mother turned her focus to completing the 500-mile trek known as the <i>Camino de Santiago</i>, beginning on the French side of the Pyrenees mountain range and finishing at <i>The Cathedral Santiago de Compostela</i> in northern Spain. Not only was the Pilgrimage a unique source of healing for Cockerham, but it became the backbone of the foundation's upcoming commitment to raise $500,000 within the next 5 years, as a promise to help prevent and abolish this horrendous disease, in loving memory of Connor.</p>

<h3>The 500-Mile Pilgrimage</h3>
<p>In September of 2015, Cockerham began her hike along the historic <i>Camino de Santiago</i> from St Jean, France, crossing over the Pyrenees and the northern part of Spain to Santiago, in memory of her son Connor. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The Camino, also known in English as <i>The Way of St James</i>, is a pilgrimage dating back thousands of years that leads to <i>Santiago de Compestella</i> in the Galacia region of Spain, where it is believed that the bones of St. James are enshrined. Thousands of pilgrims make this journey every year searching for their spiritual path or for spiritual growth, just as Cockerham had set off to accomplish.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1466538847/ujavjotibujss2e510a9.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p><i>The Melanoma Coalition's</i> Indiegogo perks will coincide with Cockerham's 35 day, 500-mile journey along the <i>Camino</i>, including day-by-day photos, personal journal entries and the final steps that brought her to <i>The Cathedral of Santiago de Compestela</i>, all with the help of the love of her life, 'The Ginger’.</p>

<h3>Funding for Research</h3>
<p>With medical breakthroughs within sight, <i>The Melanoma Coalition</i> is pushing to continue the search for desperately needed, cure-focused research support. To date, the majority of the funds raised by <i>The Melanoma Coalition</i> have been allocated for ongoing research. Almost 100% of donations received have been provided to the UCSF Melanoma Research Lab to enable the efforts of Dr. Susana Ortiz and her faculty to examine, pursue treatments and ultimately discover a cure for Melanoma. <i>The Melanoma Coalition</i> will continue to fund research, but also expand into building and supporting education and prevention programs nationally.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>To achieve our current funding goal of $100,000, Cockerham &amp; <i>The Melanoma Coalition</i> will be offering rewards associated with her recent pilgrimage along the Camino and other memorabilia related to Connor, for 45 days, in order to secure early funding to push for the annihilation of this lethal disease.</p>

Greatest Challenge that all Humans Share is to
create and maintain a viable, prospering Earth that is peaceful and productive
-- ensuring quality of life for future generations.<br/><br/><p>You no doubt realize how important this
is, yet you wonder, “How can I possibly help make this happen?” Well, for
starters, you can read this campaign page and support us. </p>
<p>And possibly, in the future, visit the
amazing, unprecedented facility that we are building.</p>
<p>Here are the realizations that brought us to the
point of creating this campaign. Today, our planet is in dire straits. We are
experiencing overwhelming challenges. </p>
<p>We are bombarded every day with images of the
cruelty, injustice and violence that takes place around the globe. We cannot
turn a blind eye. </p>
<p>Remember, we are ONE humanity - What happens on the other side of the world is also impacting our own
hearts. </p>
<p>The chaos in our world has lead to a
heightened need for seekers of truth to find answers and solutions. How we view
ourselves and how we relate to our higher self impacts the entire planet. </p>
<p>Bridges of Wellness provides a forum
for new perspectives and empowerment ... Helping you find your life purpose and
improving our world by how you love, nurture and forgive. </p>
<p>This is the new inner work. As this new
“inner work” spreads, increasing the consciousness of all people in all
nations, violence will decrease as humans are awakened to their true
sacredness. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>HOW BRIDGES IS UNIQUELY QUALIFIED TO MEET THIS CHALLENGE</b></p>
<p>Bridges of Wellness was created to be a bridge to provide
enlightened pathways for both individual and collective consciousness, through
educating and nurturing the body, mind and soul.  </p>
<p>Our core belief is that self-awareness is the only way for true
awakening. We are creating a new paradigm for ongoing spiritual discovery.
 </p>
<p>We can make a difference as we realize that<span> the inner work we do for deeper understanding has global impact. </span>It’s that awakening that can create a world at Peace.</p>
<p>Bridges
of Wellness is a non-profit educational organization, founded in 2008.<span> We are aligned with
Centers for Spiritual Living – whose Vision is “A World that Works for
Everyone.” </span></p>
<p>We are lead by a Spiritual Director with 44 years of ministry and
are now poised for growth! </p>
<p></p>
<b>
</b><p><b>OUR MISSION</b><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p>We at Bridges of Wellness feel that we’ve been charged with a
great mission …<span>To bring people back to
their authentic selves, enabling them to spread the message of enlightenment
and authenticity. </span></p>
<p>This then enables more and more people to
come from a place of love and understanding.</p>
<p>To meet this need, Bridges of Wellness MUST expand its global
message and impact. Please help us to do so. </p>
<p>Your support of this campaign allows us
to expand our physical space and launch our online <span>Soul Institute For Enlightenment. </span></p>
<p>We are creating an amazing, very special space for conscious
awakening.</p>

The Single
Greatest Challenge that all Humans Share is to
create and maintain a viable, prospering Earth that is peaceful and productive
-- ensuring quality of life for future generations.You no doubt realize how important this
is, yet you wonder, “How can I possibly help make this happen?” Well, for
starters, you can read this campaign page and support us. 
And possibly, in the future, visit the
amazing, unprecedented facility that we are building.
Here are the realizations that brought us to the
point of creating this campaign. Today, our planet is in dire straits. We are
experiencing overwhelming challenges. 
We are bombarded every day with images of the
cruelty, injustice and violence that takes place around the globe. We cannot
turn a blind eye. 
Remember, we are ONE humanity - What happens on the other side of the world is also impacting our own
hearts. 
The chaos in our world has lead to a
heightened need for seekers of truth to find answers and solutions. How we view
ourselves and how we relate to our higher self impacts the entire planet. 
Bridges of Wellness provides a forum
for new perspectives and empowerment ... Helping you find your life purpose and
improving our world by how you love, nurture and forgive. 
This is the new inner work. As this new
“inner work” spreads, increasing the consciousness of all people in all
nations, violence will decrease as humans are awakened to their true
sacredness. 

HOW BRIDGES IS UNIQUELY QUALIFIED TO MEET THIS CHALLENGE
Bridges of Wellness was created to be a bridge to provide
enlightened pathways for both individual and collective consciousness, through
educating and nurturing the body, mind and soul.  
Our core belief is that self-awareness is the only way for true
awakening. We are creating a new paradigm for ongoing spiritual discovery.
 
We can make a difference as we realize that the inner work we do for deeper understanding has global impact. It’s that awakening that can create a world at Peace.
Bridges
of Wellness is a non-profit educational organization, founded in 2008. We are aligned with
Centers for Spiritual Living – whose Vision is “A World that Works for
Everyone.” 
We are lead by a Spiritual Director with 44 years of ministry and
are now poised for growth! 


OUR MISSION

We at Bridges of Wellness feel that we’ve been charged with a
great mission …To bring people back to
their authentic selves, enabling them to spread the message of enlightenment
and authenticity. 
This then enables more and more people to
come from a place of love and understanding.
To meet this need, Bridges of Wellness MUST expand its global
message and impact. Please help us to do so. 
Your support of this campaign allows us
to expand our physical space and launch our online Soul Institute For Enlightenment. 
We are creating an amazing, very special space for conscious
awakening.
If you like what you’ve heard and are ready to support this
effort, please select one of the gift bundles to the right, and/or share our
campaign with others. 
We deeply appreciate even the smallest gesture, and hope that a
few will come forward in a big way as well. 
We can all be part of creating a World At Peace and the global awareness that Heaven on earth is
possible right now.

Enter Bubblgram.Bubblgram is messaging with a twist. With Bubblgram, messages and photos take the form of “bubbles” that you can fling off of your phone screen. Your bubble then floats in the direction you sent it like a message in a bottle until it hits another user, who can open and read its content.We are a team of Duke University students who want to change the way people chat. We’ve put hundreds of hours into this project to bring it to life, and we are dedicated in making the best product possible.What We Need and What You GetThe iOS app is already developed, tested, and ready for the App Store! We’ve developed the app ourselves without spending a single penny so far, just sweat and passion, and we plan to continue to do so. All we’re asking for is $5000 to cover server costs in order to accommodate a larger number of users. In return, not only do you get some awesome swag, but you also help make the Bubblgram experience the best it can be.Risks & ChallengesBubblgram is well on its way towards a completed product. We are polishing the iOS app, and the Android app is in development. The main obstacle between us and product delivery are server costs. Getting Bubblgram online is expected to consume a significant and costly amount of server power with each additional user. We are actively working to overcome this hurdle without taking away from the user experience of our app, and we need your help to do it.Other Ways You Can HelpHelp spread the word! If you’re excited about Bubblgram, tell your friends about us by sharing this Indiegogo campaign on social media and building the hype. Thank you!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p><b>Brief</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>We are mothers and
  fathers who constitute the school governance team of the Educational
  Community School Nina Pacha, in Quito, Ecuador. A school that provides an
  education towards freedom, through the deep understanding of the essence of
  the human being, in a historic, cultural and inclusive context, to strengthen
  the individual, family and social growth.</p>
<p>This is our history: In
  2007, eight families began to gather, organized and studied to start their
  sons and daughters education. After an intense period of work, study, and
  share mingas achieved to initiate the operation of the school. It is so for
  December 10th, when we were fourteen families, the Ministry of Education
  authorized the establishment and operation of the school Nina Pacha - Light
  for Time. The school exists because there were families who wanted school.
  Since then to date some new families have been adding.</p>
<p>Nowadays we are a large
  extended family of 72 families who have a presence and a very special feeling
  for school.</p>
<p>Now we
  want to tell everyone, friends and curious who know about this campaign that
  we need your contributions to the development and enhancement of school. When
  school is experiencing a transition, the transition <b>to start to be bigger</b>, but we feel that we need a new impulse, a
  similar impulse that the founding families made. Therefore, teachers and
  school governance think this campaign to increase its <b>infrastructure, to definitively start to be an educational reference</b>
  for the country.</p>
<p>This
  campaign is important to us because it will allow us to finance the
  construction of the classrooms we need to have room for all.</p>
<p>Currently, we have
  classrooms for children from pre-kindergarten through seventh year of basic
  education, and spaces to share as: garden, sandpit, dining room and
  playground.</p>
<p>We need to build the classrooms
  that allow us that the children can stay in school to complete basic
  education, ie, classrooms for eighth, ninth and tenth basic education, and
  even have an auditorium for music class and eurythmy.</p>

Therefore, your donation today will directly contribute to the high-level organisation of this year's event as well as to setting foundations of CASF's future growth.


Briefly about CASF

The
Festival is organized by the common efforts of 6 main participating nations
representing Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and
Tatarstan, as well as for the first time ever - Iran, Afghanistan and Turkey as
observer nations. The team is
about to organize the event for the 7th successive year growing from a simple
concert to a large-scale festival hosting over 2,000 attendees last year. 



Last year, the event featured Central Asian folk music and dance, first-time Koresh wrestling
tournament, a wide selection of traditional food as well as a cultural
exhibition. 


The Impact





We promote cultural diversity by promoting Central Asian culture in the UK


The non-profit sector in the Central Asian region is small, underdeveloped and inefficient. Our solution is to use western style charitable donations of small-scale in Central Asian countries with high level of supervision and involvement. We have made more than 20 donations across 6 participating countries in the last 6 years donating over £50,000. 

All profits made from the Festival will be donated towards charities to support orphans problems in the Central Asian region

<div>Hi, my name is Libor Miksche. Currently working for Oil and Gas industry as CNC/PLC programmer and operator. Previously i have studied Integrated High School of Engineering, which introduced me to wide range of machining, welding, CNC and PLC programming, all sorts of machine technologies and material applications. My College was of the same sort, just deepened my knowladge, and a final bit of my education was The University of Technology, where i studied material engineering.</div>
<div>I have decided to start my small campaign out of my passion for flying and my dream to share it even with those who did not pass their flight school. My plan is to build fully detailed and absolutely realistic flight simulator of one of the most used airliner of our time - Boeing 737NG 800-900. My dream is to bring the experience of simulated flight to the people and let them know what it is like to fly one of these JETs! And what do you know, maybe some of them will decide, that this is exactly what they want to do and with enough skill and intelligence, they will earn their wings.</div>
<div><br/></div> <p><span style=""font-size: 24px;font-weight: bold;letter-spacing: 0px;line-height: 30px;background-color: initial;"">What We Need &amp; What You Get</span></p>
</div><div>
<p>There is a huge amount of work to complete this dream. I have the place to put the simulator in, but thats only a start. The shell needs to be moulded and stand fabricated. There are various components, that can be obtained from other sources and are as realistic as if u take one from the plane, but some parts still need to be developped and a bit of programming and tweeking will need to be done as well. There is lots of logic circuits in those parts and all this needs to work seemlesy without a glitch. One of the tough choices will be the vision system and that will be very much dependent on the amount of money contributed by the comunity. The lesser option is to equip the cockpit with LED screens, but if the funds with my contribution allows, there will be curved projection screen with 3 projectors allowing for 220 degree seamless vision. I can not express how much appreciated all the donations will be and i have lots of hope, that this dream can become real and give many people the experience they dream of.<br/></p>

<p><b>Some building work</b> will be needed in my place to accomodate the sim. I have lots of space but the ceiling will need to be reised in the simulator room as if incorporated with the amating 220 degrees vision system the height necessary to accommodate the sim is 3,4m, which is a bit higher then current ceiling. The work to do this and possibly incorporate small refreshment bar and toilet is calculated to cost 12 000 GBP. </p>
<p>I was thinking about this for long time and i would like people visiting the sim to realy feel like home and enjoying themselfs. The workload in the cockpit can be realy high and demanding so after 2 or more hours of flying some refreshment and toilet will realy be appreciated.</p>
<p><b>The LAST is the BIGGEST</b></p>
<p><b>The projection screen</b> with projectors to offer 220 degrees seamless vision is the big deal and the cherry on top.

<p>Estimated price for this cherry on top is a whooping 54 000 GBP. We can do without, but what a shame it would be?!</p>
<p><br/></p> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>There are many simmers with only basic equipment who would like to try the real deal and also private pilots, longing to fly something bigger.</p>
<p>It will be a great opportunity for them to enjoy themselves and also gain knowladge of the complex systems and procedures involved in flying such an aeroplane.</p>
<p>I would like to make this not just a sim, but also place where people can meet and share their knowladge and experiences, building friendships, try new things and for some to prepare themselves for their future career as airline pilots.</p>
<p>The potential is great, the knowladge that can be gained even greater, individual development plans can be tailored to suit everyone and if people walk out with smile on their face i will know i have not failed.</p>
<p></p>
<div>There are currently no up to date simulators in large area around Brno, the closest one is in Prague, but that is of the old analogue 737-300 which is realy old.</div>
<div><br/></div> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>There are not too many risks, but the challenges are quiet significant. As i said i have my own place, where the sim will be build so that takes away the necessity to rent and possibly get to any kind of trouble because of it.</p>
<p>Many componets have been previously tested in different simulators, but few need to be build from parts, the schematics are quiet simple for someone who has any experience with electonics, but it needs a bit of skill to make them up and get the programming and logic correct in case there is no source code available on the internet.</p>
<p>One of the main challenges will also be time. I aim to have everything <b>completed within 8-10 months</b> after my campaign ends. This involves some structural chages in my house, getting all the parts, the sim building and testing process itself and i consider this quiet a challenge. Thankfuly some friend already offered help with the programming and the rest of building should not be a big issue for engineer like me as from my perspective it nothing more them building big computer with lots of accessories.</p>
<p>Shall any problems arise, then i have few guys to call to action and help to solve any issues with the electronics, in case something needs to be machined or any other problems involving the sim components.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p>I have all pretty much planed, but i may need someone who can <b>help with international contracts and agreements</b> as some parts will be time critical if i am to finish the sim within reasonable time and when i order multiple things from one source, say worth total of £25 000, I need to make sure the deal will be as it should be, no delays and parts in top condition. I do not have much experience with this sort of deals, so someone with knowladge in this sector could be helpful.</p>
<p>One more think will be necessary. To make a realy good <b>Website </b>that includes booking forms and some more features so pooeple who are willing to help with this aspect of the project will be looked for.</p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <p>Thank You all for the attention, especially to those who made it this far thru the article. If You at least like the idea, do not forget to share! Its important to get attention as many people as possible for the project to be successful. :-) </p><p>If someone would like to invest larger sum then please contact me by PM before doing so, and we can discuss the options, or prehabs pekr tailored to suit your whishes.</p><h4>

The potential is great, the knowladge that can be gained even greater, individual development plans can be tailored to suit everyone and if people walk out with smile on their face i will know i have not failed.

There are currently no up to date simulators in large area around Brno, the closest one is in Prague, but that is of the old analogue 737-300 which is realy old.
   Risks & Challenges
There are not too many risks, but the challenges are quiet significant. As i said i have my own place, where the sim will be build so that takes away the necessity to rent and possibly get to any kind of trouble because of it.
Many componets have been previously tested in different simulators, but few need to be build from parts, the schematics are quiet simple for someone who has any experience with electonics, but it needs a bit of skill to make them up and get the programming and logic correct in case there is no source code available on the internet.
One of the main challenges will also be time. I aim to have everything completed within 8-10 months after my campaign ends. This involves some structural chages in my house, getting all the parts, the sim building and testing process itself and i consider this quiet a challenge. Thankfuly some friend already offered help with the programming and the rest of building should not be a big issue for engineer like me as from my perspective it nothing more them building big computer with lots of accessories.
Shall any problems arise, then i have few guys to call to action and help to solve any issues with the electronics, in case something needs to be machined or any other problems involving the sim components.

    Other Ways You Can Help I have all pretty much planed, but i may need someone who can help with international contracts and agreements as some parts will be time critical if i am to finish the sim within reasonable time and when i order multiple things from one source, say worth total of £25 000, I need to make sure the deal will be as it should be, no delays and parts in top condition. I do not have much experience with this sort of deals, so someone with knowladge in this sector could be helpful.
One more think will be necessary. To make a realy good Website that includes booking forms and some more features so pooeple who are willing to help with this aspect of the project will be looked for.
   Thank You all for the attention, especially to those who made it this far thru the article. If You at least like the idea, do not forget to share! Its important to get attention as many people as possible for the project to be successful. :-) If someone would like to invest larger sum then please contact me by PM before doing so, and we can discuss the options, or prehabs pekr tailored to suit your whishes.

<div>My name is Liam Vandewalle, a final year student studying biomedical science at the University of Edinburgh and a long-time Youth Initiative Programme (YIP) hopeful. Now that I'm finishing my bachelor's degree, I'm looking to take the next step in my life and YIP is the inspiring, challenging and rewarding path I don't only want to take, but feel I need to take. It's a programme that provides youth with an education that is lacking in the world today, an education that addresses not only academic intelligence, but also creative and emotional intelligence. I feel that by developing these and other areas of myself in a holistic way, I can learn things that will help me achieve my potential, and help me give back to society on a scale that is impossible as I write this. You can find the YIP website at <a href=""http://www.yip.se"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.yip.se</a>.</div>
<div>In order to raise the money I need to attend the programme, I will be going on a 10 day solitary walk through two of Bulgaria's National Parks (Rila and Pirin). The hike will include climbing the first and third highest mountains in the Balkan region (Musala in Rila and Vihren in Pirin). I have organised travel there and back so that it is at a minimal price (hitchhiking), and have planned the route myself to avoid paying for a guide; so any money that will be given will go towards YIP and not the trip.</div> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>The total cost of the programme is roughly €10,000. I have been working during my full time studies, and will be working for two months during the summer to raise the funds. On top of this, I will unfortunately still be around €2500 (~£2000) short of the €10,000 goal. This €10,000 covers accommodation, programme costs and organic food for the 10 months of the programme. For specifics about payment, you can check out the YIP section of the website at <a href=""http://yip.se/application/costs_and_finance/."" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://yip.se/application/costs_and_finance/.</a></p>
<p>As a big 'thank you!' to anyone who gives a generous donation, I will give you a personalised gift or a letter expressing my thanks! These can range from letters or poems that I will write myself, to me getting crafty with wood or knitting you something (I'm still pretty amateur) and gifting it to you! Of course, if you'd like anything else in return, just ask me and I'll let you know if I can do it! </p>
<p>If I don't reach the £2000 goal, all of the money that I have earned will definitely go towards YIP anyway! Anything that I raise above £2000 will go to paying my parents back the amount they have supported me so far!</p>
<p><br/></p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3>
<div>Your contribution will make a world of change, not only to me but to the people who I will touch as a result of being a participant. I view this programme as providing an education that benefits not only me, but gives me the opportunities and tools to change hundreds, thousands or millions of lives for the better throughout my own life. Without this programme, initiatives that I have or might have in the future might not be recognised as fully and wholly. As an example of this, this year's YIP (YIP8) sent participants to volunteer in community project and help people in many corners of the globe, including South Africa, Nepal, California and Brazil. In these places, the participants used their heads, hands and hearts to make a difference to those who needed it. As well as this, they have fund-raised enough money to go and visit and help the refugees in Calais (their campaign is at <a href=""https://startsomegood.com/yippiesinthejungle)."" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://startsomegood.com/yippiesinthejungle).</a> By contributing to my participation fee, you are giving both me and those I will help now and in the coming years something money cannot buy, and, if you do choose to give, I would not be able to express my thanks enough.</div>

<div>One of the biggest challenges I feel exists in achieving my goal is starting this fundraiser. Since I've never fundraised like this before, it is a scary situation and exposing yourself like this feels very new! I am also sure I will face challenges during my time in Bulgaria. Hitchhiking from Edinburgh to Sofia in the first place is quite challenging, and will be the longest hitchhike I have done to date, and the walking itself will be mentally as well as physically challenging. But I am determined to overcome these challenges if it means it will bring me closer to being a YIP9 participant.</div>

<h3> </h3>
<ul>
<li>My name Fiona Compton and I am a London based Photographer/Film Maker, activist and teacher. Much of my work is designed to be colourful, vibrant and a reflection of my heritage. As a photographer and filmmaker I choose to work on not only visually inspiring displays but social issues that touch people.  Last year I launched a campaign combating violence against women, which has been hugely successful in the past year winning several awards and reaching millions of people worldwide. </li>
<li>I am out to introduce innovative and creative ways to teach children and the general pubic about Caribbean and African history and heroes who's revolutionary work made waves across the world. Through Visual art, costume design and production and original literature formed by a collective of some the best creative practitioners from the Caribbean, the project will go  on tour around schools, and galleries, accompanied with hands on workshops to help train children and young people varied practical creative platforms.  </li>
<li>Important moments in history surrounding the Caribbean and Africa are severely unrepresented in school curriculums both in the U.K and the Caribbean and my aim is to change that. To offer children an alternative hero or heroine to look up to, whilst educating about important historical and iconic moments that have been forgotten. For the most part children are of the belief that slavery is all that we come from - which is not true! </li>
<li>We are out to uplift and educate children and young adults through creativity and hands on workshops across the UK and Caribbean. Teaching Children costume design and production, creative writing, story telling through the visual arts, photography, and about important but widely unknown freedom fighters. Learning directly from the varied professionals children will leave the workshop feeling empowered as well as having learnt several new skills. </li>
<li>VISUAL IMPACT . The end goal is to produce a visual showcase bringing to life these most important heroes for children to remember and look up to. </li>
<li>VITILIGO AWARENESS . One of our esteemed designers who I am collaborating with - Darcel de Vlugt lives with Vitiligo. Extremely vocal about the condition, Darcel has spoken on NBC and Ted Talks about her experiences. She will also double up as the model as we recreate Snow White as part of the series.  An opportunity to show children beauty in all forms, acceptance and awareness of the condition, and a celebration of the many tones that fall under the Caribbean umbrella .</li>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>$4500 to pay our creatives. As the director I will be making no financial gain on this project, I myself will be making a personal investment to cover all the other outside costs surrounding getting this project off the ground and into schools. The $3000 has been the final pricing to pay the 3 very talented costume designers from the Caribbean to design and produce 10-12 original costumes for the Fairy Tales. $1000 allocation to pay our creative writers as they pen the cohesive bond to tie all the pieces together. I strongly believe in paying those who put in the hard work! $500 to contingency float to cover any potential hurdles along the way.</li>
<li>$1500 Airfare and basic accommodation  I have done all the ground work, in depth historical research, liaison with the creatives, and schools, location scouting, and investment behind needed equipment. I just need to get there to shoot the final images.  Accommodation will be supporting a local Air BNB household - as I prefer to support smaller businesses than fancy hotels !</li>
<li>$1500 Printing costs - we want to make in impact - for the visuals to be BIG and BOLD, to make a statement as soon as you enter the room. We want children to view the alternative hero as large scale vibrant works of art that will imprint a positive memory to real life revolutionaries from our beautiful past. We would also like to provide our audience with educational memoirs to take home, such as postcards or mini prints with fun historical facts.</li>
<li>The funds will be placed into a savings account - to keep the project's transparency, the details of the funds whereabouts will be made available to contributors - whilst I continue to fund raise elsewhere, I will not give up until the project is off the ground! </li>
<li>  Contributions of $100 will guarantee you an A4 canvas print of your choice, $200 and up will guarantee you a giant A1 mounted canvas print of your favourite image of the series, (please see my website <a href=""http://www.fionacompton.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.fionacompton.com</a> to see some examples of what you will get in return for your support) </li>
<li>
<strong><u>What happens if we pass our target?  </u></strong>    This  will allow us to reach out to more schools, create and develop more arts concepts and the processes of where the money will go will be documented through our social media campaign. </li>

<p>My name is Marie-Provence, I am French.

But don't get me wrong, I am not asking for your help because they are nice, I am asking for your help because I believe strongly in what they have accomplished and they HAVE TO do more, for the sake of their community and more...</p>
<p>By contributing, you will not just improve a concept, you will also help children making the right choice, ex-offenders staying in the right path, and people opening their mind towards underpriviledge communities in South Africa. </p>
<p>Concretly, we choose to keep the symbolic number of 18, that represents hope and change for the museum, to ask you 1 800€. This money will allow us to buy and furnish a new container to offer further activities such as a VR system or archives. The idea is to extend the museum and offer a service as complete and relevant as possible, to touch as much people as we can. </p>
<p>I know that if  we combine our efforts we can easily make it, but to motivate you even more, few surprises are waiting for you in order to make you understand better the purpose of 18 Gangster Museum, make you discover the South African culture and make you part of the family !</p>
<p>What's in for you ? Except the gifts, I can guarantee this good action will make you feel good about yourself and you will even be able to brag around your friends about this amazing cause you got involved in ! But more importantly, I hope you will be able to see how valuable this initiative is for Cape flats youth and community in general, I hope you will be able to see how valuable it is to try to stem this plague called gangsterism that impedes South Africa to bright as much as it should.   </p>

<h3>What is Fungi Academy?</h3>
<p>We are a nomadic collective of visionary movers and shakers focused on sharing the skills and knowledge of mushroom cultivation for food, medicine, and bioremediation (mycoremediation). Since the beginning of this year we have been developing a community living and learning space in San Marcos, Lake Atitlan, Guatemala, inspiring both locals and travelers through weekly public workshops.</p>

<p><strong>Empowering and Inspiring through Knowledge</strong></p>
<p>Our mission is to bring this empowering knowledge to as many people as possible through a travelling hub for learning and healing. We want to teach straightforward and sustainable mushroom cultivation and mycoremediation to local communities, permaculture projects, areas struck by ecological disaster, as well as transformational festivals throughout Central and South America. </p>
<p><strong>With Your Help We Can...</strong></p>
<p><span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'>Empower those most in need in regions deeply threatened by economic and environmental collapse brought about by climate change, and inspire those most capable of growing this knowledge further; the indigenous, the farmers, the communities, the travelers and of course, the dreamers and the wonderers.</span></p>

<h3>Why a bus?</h3>
<p>Our mission is to empower as many people as possible, with the help of fungi to live in healthy symbiosis with nature. Since the beginning of the year we have been teaching practical skills of mushroom cultivation, mycoremediation and responsible use of sacred mushrooms as medicine in Lake Atitlan, Guatemala. The bus can make a far greater impactby bringing this knowledge to many communities in need around Central- and South-America.</p>
<p>We believe that a Mobile Fungi Academy bus will help open-source mycology to spread like a social mycelial net.</p>
<h3>Where are we going?</h3>
<p>We want to teach straightforward and sustainable mushroom cultivation and mycoremediation to local communities, permaculture projects, areas struck by ecological disaster, as well as transformational festivals throughout Central and South America. We will be traveling from California to Mexico, Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Panama, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and maybe to the Moon.</p>
<h3>When do we start?</h3>
<p>In November, 2016 we start from California going through Mexico to Guatemala for the new years eve. We will spend 2017 spreading the good mycelium in Central-America and by the end of 2017 we want to cross from Panama to Colombia. </p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>One of the biggest challenges we face is deciding where to go in order to have the greatest impact possible. We wont be able to bring the bus everywhere, and we want to make sure the knowledge and culture exchange we create in an area continues to grow and evolve long after we leave.  To address this, we are dedicating many months to research and communication with impact centers and influential community and tribal leaders. Our website will invite visit requests through a form and slowly come to house a database of projects and resources all publicly available through an interactive map. </p>
<p>Bus maintenance, travel costs, living expenses and emergency funds also come into play, which is why we've created different contingency buffers in our campaign and plan to continue accepting donations through Patreon and Paypal once this campaign finishes.. </p>

</div></div>","What is Fungi Academy?
We are a nomadic collective of visionary movers and shakers focused on sharing the skills and knowledge of mushroom cultivation for food, medicine, and bioremediation (mycoremediation). Since the beginning of this year we have been developing a community living and learning space in San Marcos, Lake Atitlan, Guatemala, inspiring both locals and travelers through weekly public workshops.
 

Empowering and Inspiring through Knowledge
Our mission is to bring this empowering knowledge to as many people as possible through a travelling hub for learning and healing. We want to teach straightforward and sustainable mushroom cultivation and mycoremediation to local communities, permaculture projects, areas struck by ecological disaster, as well as transformational festivals throughout Central and South America. 
With Your Help We Can...
Empower those most in need in regions deeply threatened by economic and environmental collapse brought about by climate change, and inspire those most capable of growing this knowledge further; the indigenous, the farmers, the communities, the travelers and of course, the dreamers and the wonderers.

 

What We Need 
We want to buy a secondhand school bus, convert it to run on bio-diesel collected from used cooking oil, and equip it with a portable mushroom cultivation laboratory, a library, a makerspace, and more. We also need to raise money for the journey itself, paying for the bus to cross the Panama canal and the other borders of Central and South America. 


Itemized breakdown:
BUS: A used American Bluebird schoolbus
ENGINE + BODY MODIFICATIONS:Bus interior conversion to a laboratory, culture incubation system, makerspace area for collective problem solving and idea generation. Engine modified to run on used cooking oil that we will collect from restaurants along our journey,
WATER SYSTEM: Reverse osmosis water filter + water tank and pipeing.
LAB EQUIPMENT: a HEPA filter Flowhood, sterilizer unit, liquid culture station, lab tools.
LIBRARY + MEDIA EQUIPMENT:  Books, teaching equipment, projector, camera.
TRAVEL: The cost to cross the Panama canal as well as other border crossings.
WORKSHOP + COMMUNAL TENT: Two large durable tents for workshops and living.
PERK FULLFILMENT: Production and shipping costs for our perks.
TAXES+FEES: The Indiegogo and Paypal taxes and fees.
 
The Perks for Supporting Us 
New freshly oven baked stickers just came in. These are limited edition printed only once. Grab yours now.

We're really happy to partner up with The Fungus Among Us to bring you a special Fungi Academy edition of their adult coloring book. 

Help us run more workshops in schools we visit and get kids interested in the science of shrooms.

For the more studious and industrious among you, we're putting together a video course and a step-by-step ebook guide on how to build your own spore culture lab. 

Go down to Guatemala and enjoy the amazing transformational Festival Cosmic Convergence. We will be present there with our bus giving workshops and spreading the good vibe.

This will include developing a full Spanish language course that we will offer online in video format, as well as more hands-on workshops run through community impact centers we connect with.

This agile, human-powered mobile library outpost lets us provide pop-up access to library materials and services and represent the library in a variety of urban settings. Our goal will be to provide a fun and positive experience with the library and bicycles that people can tell their friends about.</p>
<h3><strong>What It Takes</strong></h3>
<p>We need to raise enough for:</p>

<p>Trish Herrera, a founding member of legacy Houston art punk band Mydolls (1978-present) and owner of Wavelength hair salon, and her Golden Retriever rescue Angel, Houston's Official Therapy Dog*, are seeking your help to fund the publication of ""Tales of a Therapy Dog,"" a self-published book written in the voice of Angel and illustrated by Gary Yokie.</p>
<p>Angel's story inspires children and adults of all ages.

<p>The work of therapy pets fosters unconditional love for all people and, as caregivers, these loving animals serve our community in positive, comforting and altogether meaningful ways.</p>

<h2>The story behind the stencil</h2>
<p>As a science student with writing and drawing difficulties I faced multiple challenges while taking chemistry courses, which often require precise drawing of molecular structures. My colleagues who shared the same difficulty and I were behind on course deliverables because of the time and effort we spent trying to draw the examples that our teacher sketched on the board or presented on slides. It was hard to keep up and it took me hours to understand at home what I tried to draw earlier in my notebook. After searching for a solution, I had developed the chemistry drawing stencil for simple, easy &amp; accurate drawing. This tool saves time in class and assists with internalizing the studying material.</p>
<p><i>“I excitingly support this project! the stencil can answer the basic and important need of drawing correctly the common molecular structures. It can be very helpful for students in various chemistry classes.” </i>prof. Assaf Friedler, head of chemistry department in the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.   </p>

<h3>Chemistry stencil - For all science students</h3>
<p>Introduction to Chemistry and Organic Chemistry are mandatory undergraduate courses taught in academic institutions throughout the world. These courses are required for chemistry students as well as for students studying other disciplines such as biology, medicine, engineering, pharmacy &amp; more.</p>
<h3>Why a drawing stencil in 2016?!</h3>
<p>A major requirement in these courses is the knowledge of molecular structures and the ability to draw them for internalizing the studying material. The Chemistry Stencil is a drawing tool that was designed to help students acquire the intricate and precise skills required for the drawing of common molecular structures in organic chemistry. Some of us students have drawing difficulties which makes studying a challenging and sometimes frustrating experience. Using the stencil can help overcome these challenges, save time in class and help understanding the chemistry reactions much better. Although their are some drawing softwares you can purchase or download through the internet, most of them are not simple, easy and quick to use even when you're not in class. the stencil allows you to draw in your notebook and write notes next to your drawing while in most of the softwares it is hard to do.   </p>

<p><strong>From notebook to PC</strong> <strong>– </strong>Though technology is rapidly progressing, hand drawing skills are still required in a variety of courses in school, college and university. The next stage of drawing templates is developing a technology platform for portable devices which would allow accurate hand drawing on the device screen. This platform can reduce the use of paper, help organize and saving studying material in a computer instead of a notebook and enhance students learning experience.</p>
<p><strong>Disciplinary drawing templates</strong> <strong>–</strong> While developing the chemistry stencil, students from different disciplines asked for the same solution, a drawing stencil that will incorporate the relevant shapes for their studies.

<h3>Your part in helping other students</h3>
<p>The stencil is already out in the market and can be found on the web.

<p>Over 60% of the youths within working age are unemployed, a result of the theoretical education that has left most Ugandan youths seeking only for white collar jobs and not caring to become innovative and solve their community problems. During my two years studying at United World Colleges Costa Rica (UWCCR), I was opened to more skill acquisition activities than I would ever have been opened to in Uganda in a period of 10 years. I particularly picked interest in dancing, radio podcasting and photography, skills am still learning and improving in to date. In addition to these skills, I also participated in various activities such as swimming, building, basketball, College events Management, Cooking for large groups, running a clothes drive for the needy people of San Jose, cleaning National Parks and rivers, starting a College canteen, debating in the Model United Nations and Hope XXL Conferences, jogging and Gym workouts, Football, Frisbee and speaking Spanish as a language.</p>
<p> <br/>After graduation at UWCCR, I travelled through Ecuador for a year. Here, I joined Levitas Dance Academy, Volunteered as an English Teacher in earthquake affected Pedernales, managed hostel operations at Hidden House Hostel and Refugio Terra Esperanza and also interned in permaculture practices (Eco-construction, sustainable Energy and Organic Farming) at Perma Tree and CINCA Ecuador. At CINCA Ecuador, I also helped design the organization’s website and managed its social media platforms. </p>
<p><br/>In Uganda however, during my primary and middle school years, I attended school from around 5:00am in the morning to 4:00pm in the night. There were only a few short breaks in between, and these were only meant for going to the washrooms, having meals and participating in sports activities. The rest of the time, we spent reading books and being beat with sticks for failing certain questions in our exams. Most of us got to a point where we could recite the whole history of our country just as it was written in the books. But interesting enough, I cannot recite any of those notes anymore, as I forgot it all. In fact, I only ever crammed them just to pass the tests. </p>
<p><br/>Unfortunately, that is the kind of education that most young children and youths are going through in Uganda. And for this reason, I have with the help of my father’s donation of land to the project, decided to set up a talent and skill acquisition school. The whole idea is to host volunteers from different countries around the world to share their talents and skills with Ugandan youth, aged 14 - 18 years. We in the long run, hope to make this an international talent and skill acquisition school with our main focus areas being in;<br/>1.    Games and sports.<br/>2.    Music, Dance and Acting, <br/>3.    Tech Innovation. <br/>4.    Natural and Eco Building<br/>5.    Organic Farming<br/>6.    Art, Crafts and Fashion.<br/>7.    Cooking and Baking<br/>8.    Languages &amp; Tourism<br/>9.    Green Energy Innovation<br/>10.    Online Businesses</p>
<p><br/>The whole idea is to help our students start a project that will most definitely employ them in the long run, hence offering financial stability and independence to them. At the same time, these projects will offer solutions to existing problems in the local communities in which these projects are based. Some of these problems include:<br/>•    High rates of poverty and unemployment of people with disabilities. <br/>•    Food insecurity and desertification. <br/>•    Little or no access to clean water, shelter, education and health care.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong><u>We will admit our students on terms that, </u></strong><br/>•    We will help them start up profitable projects by the time they graduate; at the end of the 2 year program. <br/>•    We will fund promising projects offering needed solutions to problems among Ugandan communities. <br/>•    We will connect all our students to mentors in their field of study, thus encouraging hands on experiences and guidance throughout the learning process. <br/>•    We will offer opportunities for them to display their talents and learned skills to the general public and organizations that would be interested in working with or supporting these youths.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong><u>HOW YOU CAN HELP:</u></strong><br/>To be able to build this school, we need to raise $10,000. Funds will be used to facilitate construction of the school and volunteers’ eco-buildings, fencing the school and demonstration farm, buying the necessary equipment for various courses, and taking care of our first volunteers. Construction of the school starts, 1st September and the first 3 months short courses start 1st October, 2017. We hope to make these courses affordable, and free to some youths that may not afford the course fees. This way, we will be assured of a large and ever increasing school population during the January and August intakes for the 2 year program starting next year, 2018.</p>
<p><br/> <b>TO THE VOLUNTEERS:</b></p>
<p>We will offer free accommodation, food and local tours. They will be staying right next to the Talent and skills school on our organic farming and eco-building project. At the farm, we offer demonstrations to neighboring farmers about irrigation farming, and cheap natural construction for animal houses. We also plan to start offering living loans to the local community, by the end of the year. Living loans work this way: We offer a farmer a pair of animals or seeds to start up a farming project. Once these animals or seeds have multiplied, the farmer pays back by offering the same amount of seeds or animals to another farmer in the community. This way, the benefits of the loan trickle down to the whole community, instead of the loan repayment coming back to us. Volunteers will be able to participate in these activities, and learn a lot during their stay.</p>
<p><br/>To apply for a volunteer position at our farm and talent school, please do send us a message through WorkAway.  <a href=""https://www.workaway.info/614469429736-en.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.workaway.info/614469429736-en.html</a><br/>You can apply to volunteer anytime between: August, 2017 - August, 2018. </p>
<p>The plot of land where the school will be set is almost 2 acres, and the farm about 4 acres. We will be sharing photos of the schools development and future progress at least bi-weekly to keep you posted. </p>
<p>We do not ask for much. Just <strong>$1 per donor</strong>, is enough to help us make a difference to the lives of 1,000,000 youth in Uganda (The number we expect to benefit from our program within the next 5 years). </p>

</div></div>","Over 60% of the youths within working age are unemployed, a result of the theoretical education that has left most Ugandan youths seeking only for white collar jobs and not caring to become innovative and solve their community problems. During my two years studying at United World Colleges Costa Rica (UWCCR), I was opened to more skill acquisition activities than I would ever have been opened to in Uganda in a period of 10 years. I particularly picked interest in dancing, radio podcasting and photography, skills am still learning and improving in to date. In addition to these skills, I also participated in various activities such as swimming, building, basketball, College events Management, Cooking for large groups, running a clothes drive for the needy people of San Jose, cleaning National Parks and rivers, starting a College canteen, debating in the Model United Nations and Hope XXL Conferences, jogging and Gym workouts, Football, Frisbee and speaking Spanish as a language.
 After graduation at UWCCR, I travelled through Ecuador for a year. Here, I joined Levitas Dance Academy, Volunteered as an English Teacher in earthquake affected Pedernales, managed hostel operations at Hidden House Hostel and Refugio Terra Esperanza and also interned in permaculture practices (Eco-construction, sustainable Energy and Organic Farming) at Perma Tree and CINCA Ecuador. At CINCA Ecuador, I also helped design the organization’s website and managed its social media platforms. 
In Uganda however, during my primary and middle school years, I attended school from around 5:00am in the morning to 4:00pm in the night. There were only a few short breaks in between, and these were only meant for going to the washrooms, having meals and participating in sports activities. The rest of the time, we spent reading books and being beat with sticks for failing certain questions in our exams. Most of us got to a point where we could recite the whole history of our country just as it was written in the books. But interesting enough, I cannot recite any of those notes anymore, as I forgot it all. In fact, I only ever crammed them just to pass the tests. 
Unfortunately, that is the kind of education that most young children and youths are going through in Uganda. And for this reason, I have with the help of my father’s donation of land to the project, decided to set up a talent and skill acquisition school. The whole idea is to host volunteers from different countries around the world to share their talents and skills with Ugandan youth, aged 14 - 18 years. We in the long run, hope to make this an international talent and skill acquisition school with our main focus areas being in;1.    Games and sports.2.    Music, Dance and Acting, 3.    Tech Innovation. 4.    Natural and Eco Building5.    Organic Farming6.    Art, Crafts and Fashion.7.    Cooking and Baking8.    Languages & Tourism9.    Green Energy Innovation10.    Online Businesses
The whole idea is to help our students start a project that will most definitely employ them in the long run, hence offering financial stability and independence to them. At the same time, these projects will offer solutions to existing problems in the local communities in which these projects are based. Some of these problems include:•    High rates of poverty and unemployment of people with disabilities. •    Food insecurity and desertification. •    Little or no access to clean water, shelter, education and health care.
 
We will admit our students on terms that, •    We will help them start up profitable projects by the time they graduate; at the end of the 2 year program. •    We will fund promising projects offering needed solutions to problems among Ugandan communities. •    We will connect all our students to mentors in their field of study, thus encouraging hands on experiences and guidance throughout the learning process. •    We will offer opportunities for them to display their talents and learned skills to the general public and organizations that would be interested in working with or supporting these youths.
 
HOW YOU CAN HELP:To be able to build this school, we need to raise $10,000. Funds will be used to facilitate construction of the school and volunteers’ eco-buildings, fencing the school and demonstration farm, buying the necessary equipment for various courses, and taking care of our first volunteers. Construction of the school starts, 1st September and the first 3 months short courses start 1st October, 2017. We hope to make these courses affordable, and free to some youths that may not afford the course fees. This way, we will be assured of a large and ever increasing school population during the January and August intakes for the 2 year program starting next year, 2018.
 TO THE VOLUNTEERS:
We will offer free accommodation, food and local tours. They will be staying right next to the Talent and skills school on our organic farming and eco-building project. At the farm, we offer demonstrations to neighboring farmers about irrigation farming, and cheap natural construction for animal houses. We also plan to start offering living loans to the local community, by the end of the year. Living loans work this way: We offer a farmer a pair of animals or seeds to start up a farming project. Once these animals or seeds have multiplied, the farmer pays back by offering the same amount of seeds or animals to another farmer in the community. This way, the benefits of the loan trickle down to the whole community, instead of the loan repayment coming back to us. Volunteers will be able to participate in these activities, and learn a lot during their stay.
To apply for a volunteer position at our farm and talent school, please do send us a message through WorkAway.  https://www.workaway.info/614469429736-en.htmlYou can apply to volunteer anytime between: August, 2017 - August, 2018. 
The plot of land where the school will be set is almost 2 acres, and the farm about 4 acres. We will be sharing photos of the schools development and future progress at least bi-weekly to keep you posted. 
We do not ask for much. Just $1 per donor, is enough to help us make a difference to the lives of 1,000,000 youth in Uganda (The number we expect to benefit from our program within the next 5 years). 
If you like the idea of our project, please do donate and share our campaign  on facebook, twittter, email and through word of mouth. For any questions or more information, feel free to email us at ecoafrotours@gmail.com.",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<div>After attending an engineering camp as a teenager, co-founder Max Soto felt as if he had just spent a week of his summer at school. He and his fellow campers worked on ""real world"" engineering projects, but due to their lack of experience and knowledge at such a young age, these projects were very simplified and tended to be quite boring. On top of that, during their free time, when he and other campers were not working on those projects, they were stuck hanging out in college dorms with the movie theater or bowling alley being the peak of their fun. Max left the camp without the inspiration to become an engineer. A few years later, while thinking back on that experience, he thought to himself, ""How can I change the engineering summer camp experience so that campers leave with not only a new set of engineering skills, but also with the inspiration to become an engineer and innovator?"" Soon after, Max had a ""lightbulb"" moment that sparked the idea for Imagineering Youth Camps. Since then, he and his business partner, Wilson Hack, have been developing an entirely new and innovative approach to operating a summer camp.</div> </div> <div> <h3>A Typical Day At Camp</h3> <p>The daily schedule at an Imagineering Youth Camp is equally divided between recreational and STEM-focused activities. Campers will be divided into groups of 6-8 and assigned to a group leader. These leaders will be passionate engineering students from some of the nation's top universities. </p>
<p>The 6-day-long sessions will consist of tinkering with high-tech gadgets, such as drones with an attached GoPro™<b> </b>camera and 3-D printers. After exploring the capabilities of these gadgets, we will gather the campers and have them complete a simple workshop demonstrating the various technologies contained within the products. For example, after experimenting with drones, campers will create a simple electronic circuit and remote equipped with an IR (infrared) receiver that turns on a fan using littleBits™. The fan represents the propeller on the drone and the IR remote represents the remote controller used for power and steering. While campers are engaging in each workshop, their group leader will provide a brief explanation of how and why these technologies work. </p>
<p>Each week, campers will also take part in group competitions. One of these projects will take campers through the step-by-step process of planning, designing, making and, finally, pitching a product to potential customers/investors. This will give each camper the opportunity to learn more about the business side of innovation and engineering.</p>
<p>Throughout the week, at least three guest speakers will present to the campers. These speakers will include co-founders Max and Wilson, entrepreneurs, executives from nearby corporations, and faculty members from surrounding universities. The presentations will cover topics ranging from the future of space exploration to the ethical considerations involved in building intelligent robots, creating a TED Talk environment in which campers will be exposed to material not covered in any traditional academic setting.</p>

The non-profit Organisation Cuore di Mamma directs 
its attention to disabled people, in particular 
to children affected from serious illness, or to so
cial abandoned children. The non-profit 
Organisations' aims are:    
-Developing, promoting and organising activities fo
r diseased children and adults during their 
permanence at the nursing facilities. 
-Promoting useful assets through sport and cultural
 activities 
-Promoting social solidarity through social work, c
harity and education. 
Currently, Cuore di Mamma's building, situated in R
onciglione (Piazza dei Bersaglieri, 2), 
accomodates on its' 1st floor ill children accompan
ied from their parents. This way, families are 
helped during disease duration, and also have the o
pportunity to have some days of holiday in the 
surrounding areas (Lago di Vico, Monti Cimini). We 
collaborate with  the roman hospital Ospedale 
Pediatrico Bambino Gesù . 
Until 13th July 2014 we accommodated 20 families, f
or a total of 1400 nights offered for free. 
Now, we have the opportunity to use the ground floo
r living spaces for our new project 
""Non è mai troppo presto"".      
The spaces situated on the ground floor need to be 
renovated because they have not been used 
for years. We want to create spaces to welcome ever
yone, using our rooms this way: 
-Library: a place where children will have the oppo
rtunity to read books, or borrow them. Library 
will also have a projector to watch films, or to he
ar music. 
-Study room: a room where children will be able to 
do their homework together with other children, 
or with the help of a support teacher. 
-Nursery: where mums will suckle their babies  
-Rest room: a room where everyone will be able to s
ay calm. A room that can be used to meditate 
or to pray, whatever religion. 
-Laundry. 
Inside these rooms, we want to realise activities f
or children who suffer from learning disabilities. 
The project ""Non è mai troppo presto"" aims to provi
de an early diagnosis to affected children in 
order to help them as soon as possible. 
Children will be helped with a three-year program f
rom specialised staff, which operates in the 
teaching and treatment of dyslexia field. 
As a first step of the project, we will train teach
ers and parents of affected children in the use of 
computer and technologies as a teaching help for ch
ildren with learning disabilities. In fact it is 
scientifically proved that technology is very usefu
l to cure dyslexia. 
The second step is to teach children how to use the
ir computers and how to study. We will offer 
them fun, interesting and motivating study topics. 
We also want to realise ""Zaino Multimediale"" (""Mult
imedia Backpack""), a digital library so than 
every dyslexic child will have school books on an e
-book format. 
Our last objective is to organise courses for paren
ts who have dyslexic children (""Corso per

<p><b>What is <b>Cyprus: C.E.L.T. for Peace?</b></b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The purpose and
goal of this project is to bring Greek speaking Cypriot and Turkish speaking
Cypriot students and youth (of the age 15-25) together at the Buffer Zone. The
project will provide the opportunity to build a long lasting workshop of events
and train potential students and young professionals as mentors who can start
rapprochement, reconciliation and conflict resolution programs within their own
schools, communities and societies. The anticipated outcome of the project will
be to raise awareness of the constructive potential of both communities when
they work together. </p>
<p><b>How will <b>Cyprus: C.E.L.T. for Peace work?</b></b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">This project will
allow Cypriots from both sides to come together in a safe learning environment
that offers students outstanding skills and growing opportunities. This will
provide them with a mutual passion they can share among each other, using a
combination of various theories of conflict analysis and resolution models as
well as peace-building strategies. These are specialized for the purpose of
simultaneously educating and creating communication between the Cypriot
participants. Its sole purpose would ensue to train the students of how to
create and develop similar programs within their schools, communities and
societies. This results in eventually allowing them to utilize their
understanding of conflict resolution and other new skills in catalyzing the
interpersonal barriers created due to the inter-communal conflicts.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The project will
be consisted of 8 volunteers/coordinators. A total of thirty participants will
qualify to observe the workshops. These participants will include students who
attend public (if possible) and private schools from both communities, as well
as young professionals with academic knowledge and/or personal experience in
the rapprochement initiatives.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The students will
spend a total of 8-12 days learning about the people from the other community,
as well as practical approaches of how to overcome the invisible “barriers”
between them. This will be achieved by engaging the participants, the
volunteers and the coordinators in interactive teambuilding activities and
constructive communication.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Parallel Activities of <b>Cyprus: C.E.L.T. for Peace</b></b></p>
<p><span>The program</span> <span>will organize several parallel activities for
the increase in popularity </span><span>and</span> <span>funding of the program.</span></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">During March and April 2015 this online fundraising campaign is organized. During the campaign donors will be able to offer various amounts. Depending on the amount given, each donor will receive some perks as thanks for their move. The proceeds will be used to conduct the program this summer.</p>
<p></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">A bicycle tour
around the country will increase sensitization and elevate awareness of the
existence of Cyprus: C.E.L.T. for Peace. In addition, it will support
fundraising as well as the acquisition of services in the effort for Cyprus:
C.E.L.T. for Peace to own a place where collaboration and togetherness will be
reinforced and empowered.</p>

(Connecting and Empowering the Leaders of Tomorrow - C.E.L.T.)
What is Cyprus: C.E.L.T. for Peace?
The purpose and
goal of this project is to bring Greek speaking Cypriot and Turkish speaking
Cypriot students and youth (of the age 15-25) together at the Buffer Zone. The
project will provide the opportunity to build a long lasting workshop of events
and train potential students and young professionals as mentors who can start
rapprochement, reconciliation and conflict resolution programs within their own
schools, communities and societies. The anticipated outcome of the project will
be to raise awareness of the constructive potential of both communities when
they work together. 
How will Cyprus: C.E.L.T. for Peace work?
This project will
allow Cypriots from both sides to come together in a safe learning environment
that offers students outstanding skills and growing opportunities. This will
provide them with a mutual passion they can share among each other, using a
combination of various theories of conflict analysis and resolution models as
well as peace-building strategies. These are specialized for the purpose of
simultaneously educating and creating communication between the Cypriot
participants. Its sole purpose would ensue to train the students of how to
create and develop similar programs within their schools, communities and
societies. This results in eventually allowing them to utilize their
understanding of conflict resolution and other new skills in catalyzing the
interpersonal barriers created due to the inter-communal conflicts.
The project will
be consisted of 8 volunteers/coordinators. A total of thirty participants will
qualify to observe the workshops. These participants will include students who
attend public (if possible) and private schools from both communities, as well
as young professionals with academic knowledge and/or personal experience in
the rapprochement initiatives.
The students will
spend a total of 8-12 days learning about the people from the other community,
as well as practical approaches of how to overcome the invisible “barriers”
between them. This will be achieved by engaging the participants, the
volunteers and the coordinators in interactive teambuilding activities and
constructive communication.

Parallel Activities of Cyprus: C.E.L.T. for Peace
The program will organize several parallel activities for
the increase in popularity and funding of the program.
During March and April 2015 this online fundraising campaign is organized. During the campaign donors will be able to offer various amounts. Depending on the amount given, each donor will receive some perks as thanks for their move. The proceeds will be used to conduct the program this summer.

A bicycle tour
around the country will increase sensitization and elevate awareness of the
existence of Cyprus: C.E.L.T. for Peace. In addition, it will support
fundraising as well as the acquisition of services in the effort for Cyprus:
C.E.L.T. for Peace to own a place where collaboration and togetherness will be
reinforced and empowered.

decent meal let alone KFC, Domino's, Pizza Hut, Subway, etc and I also want to buy them basic school
stuff and clothing, footwear (half of them come to the NGO center barefoot) and
sports items for them. But my job only pays me 20,000 rupees a month which is
$320 in today's exchange rate. I hope and pray that the good people in USA and around the world could donate few
dollars so I could do a lot for these kids and their families. Stuff is more cheaper here than in
USA. I could also lend money to some of these children's parents so they could start
food stall on the sidewalks so they could earn some money so their kids don't
have to beg on the streets. A small amount of $500 dollars could get one family start selling local fast food on the sidewalks. They won't make a killing but anything is better than little kids begging on Mumbai's dangerous streets and being victims of pedophiles and other criminals. So please help and donate as much as you can. On behalf of the slum kids I want to say Thank You very much for reading this. Please encourage your family & friends to donate too.",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<b>Short Summary:</b><p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Financial
literacy starts at home.  But for many parents of young children that can
be a challenge. Our children need to be taught how to manage money from an
early age.  However, financial literacy programs are few and far to be
found in elementary schools or middle schools. Children need to be
taught the four basic functions of money: Spend, Save, Invest, and Give.
 They also need to understand that all four functions of money must work
together to create a budget.  That is why I created and wrote ""The
Four Money Bears"".  Each bear represents a function of money and
shows how money works to help us accomplish our goals.   I wrote ""<span>The Four Money Bears"" book to help transform the
perception of money for generations of young children. </span></p>
<p><b>The
book, however, is just the start.  We are raising funds to develop both a digital and
hard copy financial literacy educational platform.  The funds will also be
used to provide free copies of ""The Four Money Bears"" books to schools in low income areas across the country.</b>  </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>Money Bear Basics:</b></p>
<p>The financial literacy educational platform called ""Money Bear Basics"" will be based on the successful children's book ""The Four Money Bears"". The platform will allow children to learn and gain exposure to money management tools and concepts that will shape their perception of money for years to come.<br/><br/>Parents, teachers and children will be able to access Money Bear Basics online through an interactive community based website. Kids can play games, watch videos and complete training exercises.  These activities expose young children to the skills needed to practice healthy money management habits. Kids will love the characters and enjoy the activities that engage them along the financial literacy learning process.<br/><br/>Children will initially learn about the four basic functions of money: Spending, Saving, Investing and Giving. They will learn these important values from the Four Money Bears and their friends. Once kids learn the basic building blocks of money management through building their own budget they will then learn about a variety of financial topics including:<br/><br/>- <i><b>Banking</b>:</i> Checking, Saving, CD<br/>- <i>Lending</i>: Personal loans, mortgages, auto loans<br/>- <i><b>Credit</b></i>: Credit cards, Charge Cards, Lines of Credit<br/>- <i>Investing</i>: Stocks, Bond, Mutual Funds<br/>- <i><b>Gifting</b></i>: Church, Non Profit, Family<br/>- <i>Earning</i>: Compound Interest, Time Value of Money, Rule of 72<br/>- <i><b>Financial Planning</b></i>: Assets, Liabilities, Income, Expenses<br/>- <i>Insurance</i>: Life, home, auto<br/>- <i><b>Taxes</b></i>: Sales tax, Income tax, Property tax<br/></p>

    The Impact
We all know that money is an important and valuable tool.  We know we need to earn it to make a living and survive.  But how financially literate are we as a society? Here's a more important question.  How prepared are our children to manage their personal finances when they become adults?  The Council for Economic Education and Jump$tart Coalition share some startling information:

Only 17 states require a high school course in Personal Finance.
Only 5 states require a stand-alone course in personal finance for high school graduation. Fewer than 20% of teachers feel competent to teach personal finance.
1/3 of parents are more comfortable talking to to their kids about smoking, drugs and bullying than about money.
61% of US adults admit to not having a budget.
40% of adults gave themselves a grade of C, D, or F on their knowledge of personal finance. 
The key to a more financially literate society is to expose our children to the basic concepts of what money can do for them at an early age.  ""The Four Money Bears"" book was created to teach children between the age of 5 and 10 what they can do with money.  This financial educational platform will expose children to the basic uses of money and allow them to create their own budgets.  The Money Bear Basics website and workbooks will allow children to further understand the functions of money, learn money management skills and make them better prepared to practice a healthy financial lifestyle as adults.

<h1><b>DYN: Nashville</b></h1>
<p>When you teach students design, you give them an opportunity to express their opinions and the tools necessary to inform their voice. The Nashville Civic Design Center recognized the power of engaging youth on the topic of design and created the <i>Design Your Neighborhood </i>project—funded in part by a grant from the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA).</p>
<p><i>Design Your Neighborhood</i> was conceived as an intensive four-week summer camp that would walk students through the topics of architecture, urban design, planning, civic engagement, graphic design, and filmmaking. During those four weeks, a film crew captured everything that took place and produced a documentary about the project.</p>

<p><b>A Program for Everyone</b></p>
<p>With the success of the program in Nashville, we want to take the key elements of DYN and share it with anyone interested in using it. In partnership with Anode multimedia studio (<a href=""http://anode.com/graphic-design-animator/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://anode.com/graphic-design-animator/</a>) we are in the process of creating an interactive website that will be available to any group interested in pursing the program. </p>
<p>The website design will allow for an adaptable program personalized to the needs of any group. Teachers across the country and world will be able to select a <i>Design Your Neighborhood</i> curriculum based on their projected course timelines: two hours, one day, one week, two weeks, or four weeks. However, each program direction will be supported with documentation from a wide variety of content partners to make any version of the program possible.</p>
<p>Each curriculum was based on the successful four-week program created by Gary Gaston—Design Director of the Nashville Civic Design Center and a Lecturer with the University of Tennessee College of Architecture and Design.</p>

<p><b>When you teach youth about design, You empower them.</b></p>
<div>
<p>By the age of 11, children are being affected not only by their homes, neighborhoods, and schools but the city and the larger world that surrounds them. Unfortunately, children and young adults seldom have the opportunity to participate in the planning process. But when included in this process, they bring a particular vision that may go beyond the constraints of the adult world and provide dynamism to planning that would otherwise be vacant without their input and participation.</p>
<p>From analyzing pre and post-program interview responses, the youth who participated in DYN showed development in the areas of map orientation, neighborhood design knowledge, understanding what is a healthy community, career goals, and interest in their home city.</p>

<p><b>Making a Real Difference </b></p>
<p>In 2014, The Metropolitan Development and Housing Agency (MDHA), in partnership with the Metro Arts Commission and Mayor Karl Dean of Nashville finished work on a new community park in honor of Nashville native William Edmondson (1874-1951)—a self-taught artist who was the first African-American to have a solo show at the Metropolitan Museum of Art (MOMA) in New York. The idea for the park, which sits on a previously underused strip of land near the Nashville Oasis Youth Center, came in summer 2011 from the students of the <i>Design Your Neighborhood </i>program. The teens engaged in an exercise with landscape architect Kira Appelhans to redesign the park. Shortly thereafter, MDHA contracted with Hawkins Partners to design a new park, incorporating ideas developed by the youth. Today, the park is a source of pride not only for the <i>Design Your Neighborhood</i> students, but also the community it resides in. </p>

<p><b>The Next Steps</b></p>
<p>The program was funded in part by the National Endowment for the Arts and serves its overarching goal that “the arts contribute to the strengthening of communities.” The initial funding went toward the Nashville iteration of <i>Design Your Neighborhood </i>but we need your help to make it to neighborhoods around the world. Your support will allow us to create the interactive website for communities to use and help give young adults the design knowledge and tools needed to create sustainable changes within their neighborhoods.</p>

<h3>Risks and challenges</h3>
<p>As with other non-profits, lack of funding and lack of staff can always be a challenge. This website is a massive undertaking that will require a lot of hard work, funding, dedication, research, and collaboration with local, national, and international organizations. There is also always the chance that this website will not serve young adults and communities around the world in the same way it has served Nashville. </p>
<p>Despite these risks, we at the Nashville Civic Design Center feel there is no limit to the potential of this project. With many local and national organizations supporting this program, we feel the Design Your Neighborhood Toolbox will absolutely change the way communities develop and how youth view their neighborhoods. The launching of this website will not mark the end of our work, but rather the beginning of a life-long iterative process. </p>
<p>In order to ensure this program serves communities around the world in the most meaningful way, the website and curriculum will contain a feedback component that will allow participants and teachers to truthfully document their experiences. We will then use this information to continue developing our website and curriculum to best serve your community!</p>

The Step UP to Inspire campaign is about training young girls and women to be an entrepreneurs through mentorship.  It's a call-to-action for successful women to step up and reach back to help 15 young women realize their own success by mentoring and sharing their value. 




Have you ever been inspired, motivated, and guided by a woman who cared about your success?  
A long time ago, someone reached out to me and saw my potential when I didn't see it myself.  I was insecure, confused, and didn't know how to share my gifts and talents with the world. She took me under her wings and helped me on my path.  That is what mentoring is all about, and I believe as a successful woman entrepreneur, it is my responsibility to step up and inspire another young lady on her path to success.

My name is Kim Harris and I am the Creator/Visionary
      for the Stiletto Business Strategies™ brand.  You can learn more about me by clicking here.

I am very passionate about sharing
      information that transforms business and lives, and that is why I created
      the Stiletto Women Business Owners Symposium™, a live tour that travels across the U.S. and abroad.  This platform engages      the most successful women entrepreneurs in their industry to share value and make a difference.  

The Stiletto Women Business Owners Symposium™ 2015 tour is
on tap to visit 3 domestic cities and two international cities.  We have committed to awarding 15 scholarships
within each city.  This represents 75
young girls and women between the ages of 16-30 who will be empowered with the
information shared at our symposium and making important, possibly, life-long
connections with successful women entrepreneurs.

Mentoring plays an important role in young lives, and this campaign will help us bridge the gap between those girls/young lades who don't have access to inspiring role models so they can realize their greatest possibility.

Here are some statistics on the importance of the mentoring relationship and how it impacts:

<p>In
the midst of this tragedy, groups of Palestinians started out a campaign under
the name of <b><i>(Initiators, Always</i></b>). The group was determined to work hard
with all efforts possible despite limited funds, support and shortage of resources.
Their mission is to help families and children, and to provide the support
needed in an effort to rebuild human dignity and heal Gazan’s oozing wound. The
focus is mainly on families in the Khoza’ah and Shaja’eya areas. Their homes
have been completely destroyed and most became homeless (living on streets, in
empty building/schools). Some are poor and deprived of basic human needs. </p>
<p>In
addition to the continuous work to offer the basic, necessary and urgent material
needs for these families, they also provide psychological, mental and social
support for children 8 years of age and below. These children are suffering
from insecurities, constant fear and terror and anxiety every day and night
because of the continuous bombing on their homes by the Israeli Army post 2014
war. </p>
<p>The Gaza

 to education and health. This youth friendly network also mentors and 
train young women and girls on leadership, economic empowerment, life 
skills and breaks the taboo with talks on Menstruation and Sexual 
Reproductive Health and Rights (SRHR).  The charity partners with 
friends and other organizations to distribute feminine hygiene products 
to the young women and girls. This transforms their lives by instilling 
the pride and confidence needed to lead a life filled with purpose. <br/></p>
<p>my
campaign focuses mostly on carrying out campaigns on access to education and reproductive health for young women and girls and also educating the community on breaking the taboo around menstruation. While many governments and non-governmental organizations support 
several issues affecting girls and women in Kenya, 
menstrual hygiene management often gets overlooked. Many girls  do not attend school due to taboos and stigma 
related to menstruation. They do not have access to proper sanitary pads
 and instead they have to improvise with mattresses, blankets, 
newspaper, rugs or feathers. Using these devices instead of proper 
hygienic pads can cause severe health risks, such as infections in 
girls’ genitalia – but these devices are also ineffective and 
humiliating, often resulting in blood-stained uniforms leading to 
bullying from particularly male peers and even teachers. Many girls end up missing considerable amount of school, or at worst 
even dropping out, due to humiliation and stigma related to 
menstruation. In some cases, girls engage in transactional sex so that 
they can raise the money they need to buy sanitary towels, putting them 
at the risk of HIV and STI infection. Alternatively, young girls are 
forced to skip school during the time they experience monthly periods to
 avoid both the cost of pads or use of cloths. A girl absent from school
 due to menstruation for four days in a month loses 13 learning days, 
equivalent to two weeks of learning, in every school term. My main aim is to
keep girls in school and also ensure they have access to feminine hygiene
products and health care services. The community also benefits from the campaign as they get to learn why its important to talk openly about menstruation.<br/></p>
<p>
</p>
<p> With these funds I will be able to
reach over 100 girls, community health workers and leaders, teenage mothers and peer educators from different urban slums in Nairobi. we will have a training on menstrual
management, reproductive health, teenage pregnancy and unsafe abortion as these
are the major causes of school drop out among adolescent girls. I will buy them
feminine hygiene products. I want to supply them with enough sanitary pads and
panties for a whole school term and also follow up on the progress by carrying
out an evaluation after the school term to see the impact of the campaign.</p>
</div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>
</p>
<p>I will require USD6,000 for this
upcoming event. with this I will be able to mobilize the participants, buy
pads, panties, bathing soap, body oil,  snacks/food and
soft drinks.,  pay facilitators, pay for the venue, hire tents and
chairs, hire a public address system for the day. as we prepare for this big day; community mobilization is already taking place. participants are getting ready for the  talent show  that will help boost self esteem
and discover new talents among participants.</p>
<p>- if there will be any cash left
then I will use it to print out fliers for the community especially schools
churches, health centers and chief camps as these are some of the safe spaces in the community
and often visited by many people. this will help spread the word around and
also change the attitude of the community towards girl child education and menstruation.<br/></p>
</div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p></p>
<p>this project will help create a safe
space where teenage girls and community leaders  can meet and share; be mentored
and empowered on issues around menstrual management and reproductive health and
rights. it will also  create a safe and social platform where teenage
girls from different communities can share experiences, learn from each other
and work together towards the common objective of improving health and
choices.  teenage girls will be empowered  with Sexual
Reproductive health information on their sexuality and life skills which they
will use to reduce their vulnerabilities to sexual exploitation and HIV
infection. they will be  kept in schools by providing them with sufficient
feminine products. </p>
</div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p> </p>
<p>Some of the risks in this is low
performance by some of the beneficiaries and some families forcing their children to sell the items they get and use the cash to buy food instead. We  however overcome this through strong
guidance and counselling for the beneficiaries and also openly talking to parents. We also guide them to avoid peer pressure that often
lead to selling the items to buy other personal belongings and stay up with the current  fashions.. </p>
</div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p></p>
<p>If you can't donate cash, you can
send us feminine hygiene products, find a friend who can help us. Share this to your networks.</p>
<p>Remember to use Indiegogo to share this.
Let's celebrate this year's International Women's day by helping get a girl through school and grow the next generation of leaders.</p>

out an evaluation after the school term to see the impact of the campaign.
  What We Need & What You Get 

I will require USD6,000 for this
upcoming event. with this I will be able to mobilize the participants, buy
pads, panties, bathing soap, body oil,  snacks/food and
soft drinks.,  pay facilitators, pay for the venue, hire tents and
chairs, hire a public address system for the day. as we prepare for this big day; community mobilization is already taking place. participants are getting ready for the  talent show  that will help boost self esteem
and discover new talents among participants.
- if there will be any cash left
then I will use it to print out fliers for the community especially schools
churches, health centers and chief camps as these are some of the safe spaces in the community
and often visited by many people. this will help spread the word around and
also change the attitude of the community towards girl child education and menstruation.
  The Impact 
this project will help create a safe
space where teenage girls and community leaders  can meet and share; be mentored
and empowered on issues around menstrual management and reproductive health and
rights. it will also  create a safe and social platform where teenage
girls from different communities can share experiences, learn from each other
and work together towards the common objective of improving health and
choices.  teenage girls will be empowered  with Sexual
Reproductive health information on their sexuality and life skills which they
will use to reduce their vulnerabilities to sexual exploitation and HIV
infection. they will be  kept in schools by providing them with sufficient
feminine products. 
  Risks & Challenges  
Some of the risks in this is low
performance by some of the beneficiaries and some families forcing their children to sell the items they get and use the cash to buy food instead. We  however overcome this through strong
guidance and counselling for the beneficiaries and also openly talking to parents. We also guide them to avoid peer pressure that often
lead to selling the items to buy other personal belongings and stay up with the current  fashions.. 
  Other Ways You Can Help 
If you can't donate cash, you can
send us feminine hygiene products, find a friend who can help us. Share this to your networks.
Remember to use Indiegogo to share this.
Let's celebrate this year's International Women's day by helping get a girl through school and grow the next generation of leaders.

<p><b>Josué, you and me</b></p>
<p>Us Guatemalans we are naturally skilled people, we’re quick thinkers, and we do not take anything
for granted; we work for what we want and we understand things quickly.
 However, even though there is a group of people that have a better set of
skills, not everybody is presented with opportunities to exploit them.</p>
<p>Josué,
from Sumpango, is a clear example of this. FUNSEPA, a non profit organization working with technology for education, detected his
innate and inherent skill and love for mathematics while doing a program with Khan Academy. Growing up in a place where
few possibilities appear due to its distance from the city, he was the one that
carved his future thanks to his ability with numbers. His natural talent and
his intellectual capacity are his biggest tools to continue shaping his future.
</p>
<p>But
Josué’s story is only beginning – it is up to us now to give him this yearned
opportunity. </p><p></p><p><b>If you want to lear more about Josue, here is another video... </b></p><p><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ADGOCn-6yA"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ADGOCn-6yA</a></p><p><br/></p>
<p><b>What we need and what you get</b></p>
<p>FUNSEPA
is currently collecting funds so that he can continue with his studies in an
academic establishment where his talents will be polished, in hopes of continuing
with the development of his talent, a talent that will surely enable him to
have many more opportunities that will better his future. </p>
<p>Josué’s
budget is approximately Q11,000. It breaks down the following way:</p>
<ul>
<li>Enrollment: $400</li>
<li>Monthly tuition: $85
     (for 10 months)</li>
<li>Books and school
     material: $300</li>
<li>Uniforms: $100</li>
<li>Total annual cost:
     $1,650</li>
<li>
<i>Final Total Cost
     (for three years):</i> <b>$4,950</b>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Thus,
our final objective of collecting $5,000. Truthfully, it is a number that
cannot represent the improvement, in the area of educational quality, that
Josué’s preparation will finally have – it is indeed an opportunity that opens
the doors to hundreds of more. </p>

These winners will also be gifted the  pre-requisite, world-renowned “12-Week Total Transformation TeleCourse” that  will heal her heart, help her to effectively communicate in all aspects of her  life, set healthy boundaries, and discover her purpose. 
On top of it all, when she graduates,  she isn’t just emotionally empowered, she is ready to launch her own business  or take her training out into the marketplace! 
All winners will be  announced before May 1st, 2015, pending the Nominee’s acceptance of the  Policies and Procedures of The S.W.A.T. Institute.If you know of a special woman, deserving of this incredible Empowerment Coaching Certification Scholarship, please NOMINATE her, here!
The cost of this three-year, comprehensive program—including the 12-Week Total  Transformation TeleCourse is just under $6,5000 USD. We must also cover the  cost of her books and tablet. When you donate, we match it dollar for dollar! The money goes directly to the Scholar's education. We immediately electronic transfer $1,000 to them to purchase their books and tablet. (Receipts are required.) The remainder is split between two women's tuition, education, mentorship, coaching, and support -- the Professors and staff must be paid (they receive minimal wages for their incredible talent and education); the peripheral rest is spent on learning platform fees and office administration. No profits have been ""slipped in."" This is the bare bone costs to educate two women intensively for three years (less intensively for a lifetime).Not to mention, you will receive a  multitude of fabulous PERKS as our 
way to say “Thank YOU!” for your donation! Together,  we can help heal 
the world TWO important women at a time!

In the U.S., the minimum wage is $58 a day. Would you consider  investing a half a U.S. day’s wages? Or even $50, $100 or even $200 can help  change the lives of women—and their families? Plus, you’ll receive a fabulous  gift package as our thank you.
Your gift allows  women to become self-sufficient providers for themselves and their children. In  honor of International Women’s Day and the 5th Anniversary of The  S.W.A.T. Institute, let’s celebrate solutions! 
Please, help us those who want and need  this specialized training but who can’t afford it. Women who matter. Whose  lives matter. When you educate and empower a woman, you help heal the entire  world.
In closing, we'd love to leave you with an amazing short lecture given by our S.W.A.T. Graduate, Reya Summer, ""It's A Girl; Do You Want to Keep Her?:This is what an Empowered Woman can do!Thank you for considering this campaign. We respect your time and donation!

<h3>¿Quiénes Somos?</h3>
<div>Somos actores profesionales, nacidos y formados en Colombia. Decidimos crear esta fundación con el propósito de proporcionar educación artística de buena calidad y a un bajo costo o incluso gratis. Nuestro financiamiento ha corrido en parte por cuenta de nosotros mismos y por otra parte gracias a diferentes producciones de eventos empresariales (fiestas corporativas, promoción de artículos, campañas publicitarias y funciones de teatro).

<p>The goals and visions of this center will be to impact teachers in education who are passionate to shift the future of education.  Your contributions will give us the space
needed to provide a model and teacher workshops. This model will provide
training for teachers to use upcycled materials in the classroom that are
open-ended, hands-on, encourage problem solving skills, and are full of
creative possibilities for children.   This center is committed
to being socially responsible and for every resource developed it will be
shared with schools that have little or no funding.  There are many remote schools in Indonesia
who have no learning materials or books available.  </p>

supports children’s learning and values in the early stages of
development.  School collaborations are an important element to inspire teachers about the various ways to develop sustainable classroom environments and

<p><b>Renee</b> has 13 years of experience as an arts educator. Four years ago, she was inspired to move to Bali, Indonesia after working as a Studio Arts Teacher for three years at Google Children’s Center Mountain View, CA.  Her passion, research, skills and experiences have given her the motivation to initiate and volunteer in the development of BCRC.  She is on the path to using this model to inspire local and global schools, teachers, and families to reuse everyday materials as arts and learning materials.  She wants to share these resources with schools that have no access to teaching materials.  Her experiences designing creative educational spaces and this model will further her research and development as an educational consultant.  She envisions the ability to contribute in the development of curriculums that engage children to be environmentally conscious and creative thinkers in the world.  </p>
<p><b>Sara</b>’s skills are in her abilities to be detail oriented, with an eye for innovation and perfection.  Sara has worked as a Freelance Paralegal Assistant, Personal Assistant, and her past work experiences include working for companies such as the Indonesian Oil &amp; Gas Company (PT PERTAMINA UPMS IV), the biggest Indonesian national TV broadcast (RCTI now part of MNC Group), and the South Australia North Territory Oil Search (SANTOS).  She has traveled throughout various countries and settled down in Ubud, Bali in 2009.  Motherhood has shifted her life as an independent career woman traveling the world to a stay-at-home mom.  She became part of the BCRC team as a co-owner in 2015 and shares the vision for creating innovative educational programs.</p>
<p><b>Eka</b>’s passion is teaching children and education.  Six years ago, she earned her teaching degree in Bali, Indonesia.  Her salary was about $50 and was not enough to support her family.  She later worked on a cruise ship and then moved on as a villa manager.   Eka is extremely self-initiated and can take on multi-tasks such as managing financial systems, coordinating events, running programs, and staff training.  Her daughter has motivated her to pursue her passion and contribute to a more progressive educational future in Indonesia.  Her dream is to be part of the development of remote local schools embracing the values of BCRC.  She is now part of the research for developing local educational programs and directing the on-site programs at the center.</p>

Lowering the impacts of homelessness on not only the people who are experiencing it, but also lowering impacts on our public lands while permanent housing is being sought are the reasons this campaign has been launched. Together, we can begin connecting people with the natural world, leading to better stewardship, lower impacts through education centered on sanitation, site maintenance and Leave No Trace principals. Lower impacts on the environment leads to fewer conflicts among the various user groups of our public lands and resources, ultimately lowering cost to the taxpayer through fewer calls for service to law enforcement and public sanitation agencies. Instruction at the 4th grade level, along with providing quality outdoor gear is also a vehicle for deeper engagement with social services for those in need. I sincerely hope I have piqued your interest. If so, please read on...</p><p>I am the Owner, Cody Standiford and I have spent my life pursuing outdoor recreation activities, fish and game to feed my family and time in the outdoors to feed my soul. I have raised both of my sons in this lifestyle so as to impart the values of Leave No Trace, and to leave the outdoors in better shape than we found them. I have spent my adult life serving my community and my country through law enforcement, active service in the US Army, work with Veterans and Active Duty Service Members at the US House of Representatives level as a staffer in the House Wounded Warrior Program, work with fellow combat Veterans in the US Dept. of Veterans Affairs, followed by several years of work with homelessness and low-income families in the non-profit sector. Through this varied career path, I have come to possess a deep desire to help those who are in need, making the world just a little brighter through community service and policy advocacy that will begin to address the growing needs of homeless and at-risk individuals, families and children. </p><p>Many people are forced to live in the outdoors, and few have the skills or experience <i>before </i>becoming homeless that are needed to not only allow for a measure of comfort and safety, but also minimize the impacts on our natural resources.</p><p>User conflicts on public lands are becoming more and more routine. People living on our public lands who do not possess outdoor living skills often reside in camps that are very hard to look at due to the unsanitary nature of their living situation.</p><p>The number of <i>children </i>who are forced to live outdoors is on the rise. <strong>OSO </strong>is committed to teaching these children, via our public schools, the skills and providing them the gear necessary to live a healthier, safer life in the outdoors…at no cost to the children, schools or taxpayers.</p><p>In order to minimize the chances these children will have additional unwanted attention drawn to them due to the fact they are homeless or at imminent risk of becoming homeless, <strong>OSO </strong>will teach skills to every child in the classroom, ensuring equality and instilling a sense of community through shared experience.</p><p>For those children who are not homeless, they will be connected to the outdoors in the hope that they will grow to appreciate our resources and become good stewards for generations to come.</p><p>For those children who <i>are </i>homeless, they too will be connected to our resources in a different light, aiming to impart the desire to live in an environment that is cleaner, healthier and with less impact on our public lands.</p><p><strong>OSO </strong>will also provide opportunities for homeless, as well as formerly homeless people to give back to their community through teaching and mentoring of children in need through a supported employment program. Volunteer opportunities will abound for other members of our communities as well.</p><p>In order to provide this community service, at no cost to the child, school or taxpayer...<strong>OSO </strong>needs your help. The cost to teach skills and provide each child with a starter gear kit is about $500 per child. Providing a supported employment opportunity for people who are, or formerly were homeless can be done for $12,000 per <i>year. </i></p><p>In order to conduct a pilot of this program, serving 90 children in our public schools, <strong>OSO </strong>is seeking initial backing via investment, and/or backing contributions in the amount of $100,000. Initial purchase of gear for each child, at retail cost, is approximately $500 (totaling $45,000) and provides the foundation for a gear closet that will last for many years to come. Basic needs of shelter, water, food, first aid and field sanitation are provided for in the kit.

Lowering the impacts of homelessness on not only the people who are experiencing it, but also lowering impacts on our public lands while permanent housing is being sought are the reasons this campaign has been launched. Together, we can begin connecting people with the natural world, leading to better stewardship, lower impacts through education centered on sanitation, site maintenance and Leave No Trace principals. Lower impacts on the environment leads to fewer conflicts among the various user groups of our public lands and resources, ultimately lowering cost to the taxpayer through fewer calls for service to law enforcement and public sanitation agencies. Instruction at the 4th grade level, along with providing quality outdoor gear is also a vehicle for deeper engagement with social services for those in need. I sincerely hope I have piqued your interest. If so, please read on...I am the Owner, Cody Standiford and I have spent my life pursuing outdoor recreation activities, fish and game to feed my family and time in the outdoors to feed my soul. I have raised both of my sons in this lifestyle so as to impart the values of Leave No Trace, and to leave the outdoors in better shape than we found them. I have spent my adult life serving my community and my country through law enforcement, active service in the US Army, work with Veterans and Active Duty Service Members at the US House of Representatives level as a staffer in the House Wounded Warrior Program, work with fellow combat Veterans in the US Dept. of Veterans Affairs, followed by several years of work with homelessness and low-income families in the non-profit sector. Through this varied career path, I have come to possess a deep desire to help those who are in need, making the world just a little brighter through community service and policy advocacy that will begin to address the growing needs of homeless and at-risk individuals, families and children. Many people are forced to live in the outdoors, and few have the skills or experience before becoming homeless that are needed to not only allow for a measure of comfort and safety, but also minimize the impacts on our natural resources.User conflicts on public lands are becoming more and more routine. People living on our public lands who do not possess outdoor living skills often reside in camps that are very hard to look at due to the unsanitary nature of their living situation.The number of children who are forced to live outdoors is on the rise. OSO is committed to teaching these children, via our public schools, the skills and providing them the gear necessary to live a healthier, safer life in the outdoors…at no cost to the children, schools or taxpayers.In order to minimize the chances these children will have additional unwanted attention drawn to them due to the fact they are homeless or at imminent risk of becoming homeless, OSO will teach skills to every child in the classroom, ensuring equality and instilling a sense of community through shared experience.For those children who are not homeless, they will be connected to the outdoors in the hope that they will grow to appreciate our resources and become good stewards for generations to come.For those children who are homeless, they too will be connected to our resources in a different light, aiming to impart the desire to live in an environment that is cleaner, healthier and with less impact on our public lands.OSO will also provide opportunities for homeless, as well as formerly homeless people to give back to their community through teaching and mentoring of children in need through a supported employment program. Volunteer opportunities will abound for other members of our communities as well.In order to provide this community service, at no cost to the child, school or taxpayer...OSO needs your help. The cost to teach skills and provide each child with a starter gear kit is about $500 per child. Providing a supported employment opportunity for people who are, or formerly were homeless can be done for $12,000 per year. In order to conduct a pilot of this program, serving 90 children in our public schools, OSO is seeking initial backing via investment, and/or backing contributions in the amount of $100,000. Initial purchase of gear for each child, at retail cost, is approximately $500 (totaling $45,000) and provides the foundation for a gear closet that will last for many years to come. Basic needs of shelter, water, food, first aid and field sanitation are provided for in the kit. Operating costs, including wages (including one Supported Employment position for the first year), travel expenses, outreach and marketing make up the remainder of initial investments needed ($55,000).In the event the initial cohort of 90 children are not reached during year one, funds and gear will roll over for the following year. If you wish to contribute as a backer, in any amount, your money will be immediately put to work in the form of gear purchases for the Pilot.

<p><strong><u>What is Canada?</u></strong></p>
<p>This year, 2017, in Canada we are told we are celebrating 150 years of Confederation.  If so, why, in 1982 did Prime Minister Trudeau go to a <i>foreign power</i> and ask <i>them</i> to create and authorize a constitution for Canada?    If we were already a de jure government for 115 years (1867-1982), why would Prime Minister Trudeau deem it necessary?    It is a question worth asking and worth answering!   Maybe he was making us double de jure?</p>
<p>So... What is Canada?.....  It is not a legend, not a sovereign nation, not a nation state.  Actually, we have discovered it is a Myth.   All we have been told, taught, read in official history books are deceptions, manipulations and in many cases, outright fraud.</p>
<p>The evidence presented in this documentary film ""The Myth is Canada"" has been thoroughly researched and the conclusions are based from within those researched documents.  </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Evidence!  Not hearsay.  Evidence.</p>
<p>Yes, it is controversial.   Yes, it is ground breaking.   Yes, initially, it will create disbelief...</p>
<p>But... when a people have been largely unknowingly subjected to lies for 150 years by a select few, in the know...  finally hearing and gaining perspective on the truth will be monumental.  </p>
<p>We have invested many years ensuring all information researched is correct.</p>

<p><u><strong>Risk &amp; Challenges</strong></u></p>
<p>The <i>major challenge</i> with this documentary has been the 12.5 years of research and coming to understand the various pieces of the puzzle in a comprehensive manner.  Often it was a combination of ""something not seeming right"" that kept us digging to satisfy that nudge - and otherwise, investigating various rabbit holes that delivered additional critical pieces of information.    Yet, over the past 12.5 years, we did complete the research and now, we are ready.  Ready to reveal the truth of Canada in the format of a documentary film.    </p>
<p>We see the <i>major risk</i> with this documentary is not getting it funded so that this very important knowledge can get out to you, to ALL The People of Canada. </p>

""The Myth is Canada"" Production Timeline

 
Risk & Challenges
The major challenge with this documentary has been the 12.5 years of research and coming to understand the various pieces of the puzzle in a comprehensive manner.  Often it was a combination of ""something not seeming right"" that kept us digging to satisfy that nudge - and otherwise, investigating various rabbit holes that delivered additional critical pieces of information.    Yet, over the past 12.5 years, we did complete the research and now, we are ready.  Ready to reveal the truth of Canada in the format of a documentary film.    
We see the major risk with this documentary is not getting it funded so that this very important knowledge can get out to you, to ALL The People of Canada. 
Your contribution is critical to the making of ""The Myth is Canada"".
Thank you for contributing the amount you are ""inspired"" to contribute!

<p><b>Update June 16th: </b>Our new website is finally up and running :-)</p>
<p><b>Update June 15th:</b> Upon request, we are adding white T-shirts without logo with fun horsey pictures as perks. Pictures were drawn for us by our friend and we have a version for men and for women. Our male friends were complaining that they do not have a perk they could buy if they are not ""horse people"" and so came up with this idea. It makes for a nice present as well. We hope you will like them, here are the drawings, they will be printed on the shirts without background. For non-smokers, we also have a version without it, just with beer :-)</p>

<h3>About us</h3> <p>Thank you for taking the time to get to know Yeguada D. Yeguada D is a small but quality breeding program of the Pura Raza Espaňola (Pure Spanish Horse) focusing on the incredibly kind and noble character that these amazing horses can have while at the same time supporting their functionality without loosing the authentic qualities of the PRE breed. This is proving to be a heroic task as these days in Spain and around the world, a Spanish Horse seems to be either athletic or kind or spanish looking - very rarely all of these put together. Of course, everybody has their own idea to an extent of an ""ideal"" Spanish Horse. I love the Spanish Horse, beyond what words can describe, and my own vision is of a noble and kind horse of good height and functional gates who still looks like a Spanish Horse. That is where my dream lies = a small PRE farm with 5 or so babies per year of this quality and sharing these loving soulful horses with others. </p>
<p>My name is Barbora Kalinova, I am 38 years old. The Spanish Horse came to my life when I was working on my master's degree at Stanford University in the USA. After my father unexpectedly passed away in Prague, I was devastated and questioned the sense of everything. My life, my career ambitions, all of it. Things really did change for me. And then, through some ""strange"" circumstances, I found a black colt online. It was Ducado, the love of my life. And our journey started. He fell in love with me as much as I did with him, the first time I saw him. He flew with me back to Europe and has since taught me so much that I will always be truly deeply indebted to him. He has taught me how incredible of a relationship could be formed between a horse and a human, how forgiving and so very kind a Spanish Horse could be. He always showed me what kind of a person I was and would like to be, with a kind reflection. He could sense what was going on with me, at any stage of my life, and if I did not notice, he would let me know. They say that a horse and how he is and behaves, is a reflection of his owner. Even more true with this breed. This might sound a bit strange, however the Spanish Horse has always been bred with noble, kind and sensitive character as priority, so through the centuries, a very special human partner emerged - a loving horse that is attracted to humans in a special way. Through Ducado and our other Spanish Horses, I have learned so many new things in so many different areas of life, from veterinary medicine and nutrition, athletics, self-development all the way to soul searching and energy healing such as REIKI etc. It has been an incredible journey that has made me a better person and I have always tried to do absolutely all in my power to give back to my horses and keep them happy and healthy - from manufacturing top quality natural feed for them in the UK to regular physiotherapy sessions and so on. I strongly believe that prevention is the key to their wellbeing, be it in the form of top nutrition or physiotherapy massages or in preventative products such as Back on Track. </p>
<p>I was debating whether to make a new video for the main video here, however decided on posting the one above. I have made this video last year when finding a soulmate for one of our foals, DUC Brambi. I wanted to show people how special the Spanish Horse is. Much of what Brambi is showing, was experienced by her for the first time in her life and so it shows you her true reactions to new things and how she learns. When she is touching the hand of my friend with her nose during the walk, she is showing complete trust in her human, ensuring that she is there with her and would save her if something went wrong :-) Brambi was 2 years old on this video and found her human friend only few weeks after it was published. They are very happy together and we get regular updates on their journey together.</p>
<p>It is very important to me to give back to these horses for their kindness and such a huge and generous heart. I never compromise on anything, be it care or devotion or expenses. They get all the best they deserve. A picture is worth a thousand words so here are some photos of our babies for you:</p>

</div><div><br/></div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>I have been very lucky over the past almost 10 years now with making some incredible friends within the PRE world in Spain. As I am used to learning and educating myself, I have researched and researched all I could related to our project and slowly things started to move into the right direction. Top quality horses found their way to us and I have made lifelong friendships, which I am truly grateful for and that helped to make it happen. It has not been easy though at all. Everything I have goes into this dream and even though every now and then a foal is sold, the expenses are astronomical. I can only do this right and so every foal gets everything best and is sold only to the best home. The new owners are friends now and I visit the foals on regular basis. Everything gets put back into the horses. Recently, we have been able to purchase a calificado breeding mare (elite breeding approval, very rare), few top quality young girls and so our future broodmare band seems to be successfully coming together. They are the highest quality girls and given the mare usually gives around 70% or more to the foal, it is really important to get the best girls. And now, an incredible opportunity presented itself, which I feel is almost the finish line to building our foundation. This stallion, Dobres PLC, is the father of some of our girls (last few in the photos above), and for me is the best Spanish Horse I have seen in terms of not just his quality but also what he consistently produces - my ideal Spanish Horse. I've had the honour of knowing him and most of his 20 or so foals for the past few years and admired him silently, never even dreaming this could happen. And then, as it happened so many times in the past, through very ""strange"" circumstances, it really did happen. To make a long story short, I had 10 hours to decide, as this is the way it works with these things. And if I would find the strength to decline, he would be sold to Mexico and leave as many of the good PRE horses do these days... Needles to say, Dobres is now a part of our journey, however very difficult step financially especially with all the recent huge expenses for new girls and now the additional expenses in the near future for his activities. Dobres is currently at a reproduction clinic in Northern Spain at our friend and then will go back to the ""Maestro of Maestros"" in Spain, Juan Gavira, who has selected him for the fall show season in Spain. We will present Dobres in the fall in the hardest breed shows in Spain and hope to qualify him for SICAB 2015 in November - the finals of the PRE show season. We, along with everybody who saw him, truly believe in him. Juan Gavira, is the most respected and knowledgeable presenter in Spain, a legend in the PRE world, and he has huge hopes for Dobres. Dobres has to place between 1st and 3rd spot in at least 3 shows in order to qualify for SICAB. We feel he deserves to do this and then he will come home to us and slowly and correctly learn dressage through the levels. We want to keep him healthy and happy as all other our horses, which of course means, that our expenses in the next 6 months are going to be extremely high. But we feel that if we last somehow until he starts showing and will be seen, we will be ok for good. As his purchase was significant and not expected and in not ideal time, we are trying to find some help while offering what we can in return...I even thought of a minority partner of Yeguada D, however that is difficult to find and I need to make sure it will always be about the horses and not about making money, if that makes sense...</p>
<p>Where will the funding go specifically?</p> <ul> <li>Show expenses</li> <li>Training expenses</li> <li>Travel expenses of Dobres</li>
<li>Veterinary and reproduction expenses</li>
<li>Feed and special preventative supplements to keep him healthy</li>
<li>Physiotherapy expenses for Dobres</li>
<li>Insurance expenses</li>
<li>If anything is left over = Tack for shows including promotional banners for shows, tack with logos, help with his custom saddle expenses, transport home to us, many more expenses, for example dressage training expenses are always very big even though my very close friend - on many photos and the video - is a Grand Prix dressage trainer and rider and we work together because she is very gentle and kind to the horses (the amount listed above as needed is the amount we need in order to keep Dobres going until and through SICAB without his custom saddle and tack expenses).

<h3>The Impact</h3> <p>I believe that Dobres is the last piece of the puzzle for establishing the foundation for our dream project. He is the epitomy of the ""ideal"" Spanish Horse. Noble, kind, majestic. Big size with bone, exceptional morphology, true to the breed. His gates are functional and athletic, he can sit on his hind end. Good back. On top of it all, he transmits all of this to his foals and almost clones himself into them. I feel so honoured to be able to get to know him and still can hardly believe he is mine.</p>
<p>I also believe that if we are lucky (there are always sooo many risks with live animals, there are absolutely no certainties ever, which makes it so tough), Dobres could even help with some of the never-ending financial expenses we are always facing and help us get an actual home of our own one day. So we could finally stop renting and could give all the horses their own home they deserve so very much.</p>
<p><br/></p> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p> Horses are alive, which means they could get hurt or worse. Even with my approach of investing hugely into preventative measures, it is a very risky project.  I used to stress all the time that something will happen to my beloved four legged friends and finally realized that is no way to live or to work on a dream. I cannot promise anything, all I could do is ensure they get the top care they deserve and hope it will be enough. I feel prevention and quality care is the key and they do get that. I can promise that to you.</p>

Update June 15th: Upon request, we are adding white T-shirts without logo with fun horsey pictures as perks. Pictures were drawn for us by our friend and we have a version for men and for women. Our male friends were complaining that they do not have a perk they could buy if they are not ""horse people"" and so came up with this idea. It makes for a nice present as well. We hope you will like them, here are the drawings, they will be printed on the shirts without background. For non-smokers, we also have a version without it, just with beer :-)

About us Thank you for taking the time to get to know Yeguada D. Yeguada D is a small but quality breeding program of the Pura Raza Espaňola (Pure Spanish Horse) focusing on the incredibly kind and noble character that these amazing horses can have while at the same time supporting their functionality without loosing the authentic qualities of the PRE breed. This is proving to be a heroic task as these days in Spain and around the world, a Spanish Horse seems to be either athletic or kind or spanish looking - very rarely all of these put together. Of course, everybody has their own idea to an extent of an ""ideal"" Spanish Horse. I love the Spanish Horse, beyond what words can describe, and my own vision is of a noble and kind horse of good height and functional gates who still looks like a Spanish Horse. That is where my dream lies = a small PRE farm with 5 or so babies per year of this quality and sharing these loving soulful horses with others. 
My name is Barbora Kalinova, I am 38 years old. The Spanish Horse came to my life when I was working on my master's degree at Stanford University in the USA. After my father unexpectedly passed away in Prague, I was devastated and questioned the sense of everything. My life, my career ambitions, all of it. Things really did change for me. And then, through some ""strange"" circumstances, I found a black colt online. It was Ducado, the love of my life. And our journey started. He fell in love with me as much as I did with him, the first time I saw him. He flew with me back to Europe and has since taught me so much that I will always be truly deeply indebted to him. He has taught me how incredible of a relationship could be formed between a horse and a human, how forgiving and so very kind a Spanish Horse could be. He always showed me what kind of a person I was and would like to be, with a kind reflection. He could sense what was going on with me, at any stage of my life, and if I did not notice, he would let me know. They say that a horse and how he is and behaves, is a reflection of his owner. Even more true with this breed. This might sound a bit strange, however the Spanish Horse has always been bred with noble, kind and sensitive character as priority, so through the centuries, a very special human partner emerged - a loving horse that is attracted to humans in a special way. Through Ducado and our other Spanish Horses, I have learned so many new things in so many different areas of life, from veterinary medicine and nutrition, athletics, self-development all the way to soul searching and energy healing such as REIKI etc. It has been an incredible journey that has made me a better person and I have always tried to do absolutely all in my power to give back to my horses and keep them happy and healthy - from manufacturing top quality natural feed for them in the UK to regular physiotherapy sessions and so on. I strongly believe that prevention is the key to their wellbeing, be it in the form of top nutrition or physiotherapy massages or in preventative products such as Back on Track. 
I was debating whether to make a new video for the main video here, however decided on posting the one above. I have made this video last year when finding a soulmate for one of our foals, DUC Brambi. I wanted to show people how special the Spanish Horse is. Much of what Brambi is showing, was experienced by her for the first time in her life and so it shows you her true reactions to new things and how she learns. When she is touching the hand of my friend with her nose during the walk, she is showing complete trust in her human, ensuring that she is there with her and would save her if something went wrong :-) Brambi was 2 years old on this video and found her human friend only few weeks after it was published. They are very happy together and we get regular updates on their journey together.
It is very important to me to give back to these horses for their kindness and such a huge and generous heart. I never compromise on anything, be it care or devotion or expenses. They get all the best they deserve. A picture is worth a thousand words so here are some photos of our babies for you:

























































  What We Need & What You Get I have been very lucky over the past almost 10 years now with making some incredible friends within the PRE world in Spain. As I am used to learning and educating myself, I have researched and researched all I could related to our project and slowly things started to move into the right direction. Top quality horses found their way to us and I have made lifelong friendships, which I am truly grateful for and that helped to make it happen. It has not been easy though at all. Everything I have goes into this dream and even though every now and then a foal is sold, the expenses are astronomical. I can only do this right and so every foal gets everything best and is sold only to the best home. The new owners are friends now and I visit the foals on regular basis. Everything gets put back into the horses. Recently, we have been able to purchase a calificado breeding mare (elite breeding approval, very rare), few top quality young girls and so our future broodmare band seems to be successfully coming together. They are the highest quality girls and given the mare usually gives around 70% or more to the foal, it is really important to get the best girls. And now, an incredible opportunity presented itself, which I feel is almost the finish line to building our foundation. This stallion, Dobres PLC, is the father of some of our girls (last few in the photos above), and for me is the best Spanish Horse I have seen in terms of not just his quality but also what he consistently produces - my ideal Spanish Horse. I've had the honour of knowing him and most of his 20 or so foals for the past few years and admired him silently, never even dreaming this could happen. And then, as it happened so many times in the past, through very ""strange"" circumstances, it really did happen. To make a long story short, I had 10 hours to decide, as this is the way it works with these things. And if I would find the strength to decline, he would be sold to Mexico and leave as many of the good PRE horses do these days... Needles to say, Dobres is now a part of our journey, however very difficult step financially especially with all the recent huge expenses for new girls and now the additional expenses in the near future for his activities. Dobres is currently at a reproduction clinic in Northern Spain at our friend and then will go back to the ""Maestro of Maestros"" in Spain, Juan Gavira, who has selected him for the fall show season in Spain. We will present Dobres in the fall in the hardest breed shows in Spain and hope to qualify him for SICAB 2015 in November - the finals of the PRE show season. We, along with everybody who saw him, truly believe in him. Juan Gavira, is the most respected and knowledgeable presenter in Spain, a legend in the PRE world, and he has huge hopes for Dobres. Dobres has to place between 1st and 3rd spot in at least 3 shows in order to qualify for SICAB. We feel he deserves to do this and then he will come home to us and slowly and correctly learn dressage through the levels. We want to keep him healthy and happy as all other our horses, which of course means, that our expenses in the next 6 months are going to be extremely high. But we feel that if we last somehow until he starts showing and will be seen, we will be ok for good. As his purchase was significant and not expected and in not ideal time, we are trying to find some help while offering what we can in return...I even thought of a minority partner of Yeguada D, however that is difficult to find and I need to make sure it will always be about the horses and not about making money, if that makes sense...
Where will the funding go specifically?  Show expenses Training expenses Travel expenses of Dobres
Veterinary and reproduction expenses
Feed and special preventative supplements to keep him healthy
Physiotherapy expenses for Dobres
Insurance expenses
If anything is left over = Tack for shows including promotional banners for shows, tack with logos, help with his custom saddle expenses, transport home to us, many more expenses, for example dressage training expenses are always very big even though my very close friend - on many photos and the video - is a Grand Prix dressage trainer and rider and we work together because she is very gentle and kind to the horses (the amount listed above as needed is the amount we need in order to keep Dobres going until and through SICAB without his custom saddle and tack expenses).

Many Tunisian activist decided to come together and create Youth Decides- a

</div></div>","In 2011,
Tunisian youth sparked the arab spring. With the help of technology and
peaceful protests The young people of Tunisia succeeded in toppling down one of
the middle east toughest dictatorships. The Tunisian revolution started because
of the lack of opportunities and unjustice. With one of the highest rates of
unemployed graduate, Tunisia educated youth has been feeling hopeless. 

Many Tunisian activist decided to come together and create Youth Decides- a
Tunisian Not-for-Profit organization. The organization was launched about a
year ago. In a year, with the combined effort of many civil society actors, Our
organization has succeeded in creating change with the use of technology to
create opportunities and hope. We also worked hard on creating the frame that
will make our work more beneficial. Structural reform is one of our many
challenges that we has been tackling one by one. 
Tunisia is facing a tough transition, just as the 2010 Jasmine
Revolution continues to transform the ancient land of Hannibal, Ibn Khaldun,
Barbarossa and Khayr al-Din. From the deep sahara in the south to the beautiful
Mediterranean in the north. We hope to share our enthusiasm with all the
Tunisian youth. We want to help everybody acquire the tools and solve the
unemployment problem. All of us is on the front lines of the change.
 WeCode. Is a boot camp that started by taking
place in Tunis to train young Tunisians. These young people learn how to
develop mobile apps, websites, pitch ideas. They learn how to take their ideas
from a pen and a paper to a computer screen that helps them create change and
make a living. 
The money will be spent on making more camps happen in all the regions
of the country. We hope we can bring together more youth and turn their unique ideas
into lines of codes and a very useful mobile apps or websites. We are determinant
to create change and step by step make the project a national economical
inclusion project --and know the value of having a strong team. We are relying
on environmentalists and our friends across the world to help us push this project
forward a wider scope, more outreach and in major impact.
We want a Tunisian society that is free of unjustice and full of

<b></b><p>Jacqulyn is a self-proclaimed “Jax of all trades.” She drove a school bus in West Chester, PA and volunteered for the Downingtown Fire Department while she attended the nursing program at West Chester University. Upon returning to her hometown, she continued her education at Plymouth State University in another direction : Biology and Education. During this time she also worked as a Residential Counselor at Spaulding Youth Center, and a tutor for children ages 6 to 56 in subjects from basic math and reading to ecology, conservation, microbiology, and genetics. She researched water quality with the Department of Environmental Services and tree phenology with the Margret and H.A. Rey Center. She's also a doula.

We do not have the expectation that people will contribute here just because we're trying to start a family business either. Folks support what they believe in. There have been successful campaigns for medical expenses, down payments on homes, opening schools in third-world countries, sending local athletes to championship competitions, and helping people start businesses.

So, what's in it for you? Since we are trying to start a business and not a non-profit, not a tax break. If you are a parent in our communities, Saplings would be a unique alternative learning environment for your child.

<p>Ross William Ulbricht is facing federal charges associated with his alleged involvement with the Silk Road marketplace, a dark net website that allowed users to buy and sell illicit goods.  The case has big implications not only for <b>Ross and his family</b>, but for <b>the future of internet freedom</b> as we know it.  The State is attempting to hold Ross responsible for the actions of users on a website he created.  If they are able to do this, it sets a <b>dangerous precedent</b> that other webmasters and site owners may be legally responsible for their user's behavior. <br/></p>
<p>For those that know Ross Ulbricht, he is a good person and no criminal.  He is now facing <b>30 years to life in prison</b>.  Regardless of the level of involvement he had in the building or administering the Silk Road website, <b>he does not belong in a cage</b>.  </p>
<p>Also at stake is the <b>age old battle of freedom vs. control</b>.  The Silk Road, Bitcoin, TOR, and encryption represent<b> major threats to the powers that be </b>and this trial is one of the first cases where all of these technologies are being brought in to the public spotlight.  The outcome of this case will impact the way the public views these radical technologies. </p>

Send the Liberty Beat to NYC to Report on the Ross Ulbricht Trial!

               ""I get updates on the Ross Ulbricht trial exclusively from                The Liberty Beat and John Bush. Bush is dedicated to                truth about the key criminal trials that affect our freedom                -- which is perhaps why the mainstream media is looking away"".                                   - Millie Thompson (Antonio Buehler's Attorney)
The Liberty Beat daily news service is raising money to provide you with full in-depth coverage of the Ross Ulbricht Trial with reporters on the ground during the entirety of the trial.  Money we will raise will pay for travel costs, living expenses, advertising, graphic design, live blogging, and other activities supporting our coverage.  We will also have writers and staff support back at in Central Texas writing stories and compiling information from the trial and coordinating advertising, outreach, and fundraising efforts. 
Everything we raise above our goal will be split 50/50 between the Free Ross Legal Defense Fund and ongoing media and activist efforts to bring attention to Ross Ulbricht's ongoing legal battles.  
Our coverage of the first week of the trial reached hundreds of thousands of people, providing them with breaking news and a perspective and depth of knowledge they won’t find on other media outlets.  

About the Case
               John Bush is the only journalist I interviewed with                the first week of Ross' trial. I look forward to more                of his good work."" - Lyn Ulbricht (Ross' Mother)
Ross William Ulbricht is facing federal charges associated with his alleged involvement with the Silk Road marketplace, a dark net website that allowed users to buy and sell illicit goods.  The case has big implications not only for Ross and his family, but for the future of internet freedom as we know it.  The State is attempting to hold Ross responsible for the actions of users on a website he created.  If they are able to do this, it sets a dangerous precedent that other webmasters and site owners may be legally responsible for their user's behavior. 
For those that know Ross Ulbricht, he is a good person and no criminal.  He is now facing 30 years to life in prison.  Regardless of the level of involvement he had in the building or administering the Silk Road website, he does not belong in a cage.  
Also at stake is the age old battle of freedom vs. control.  The Silk Road, Bitcoin, TOR, and encryption represent major threats to the powers that be and this trial is one of the first cases where all of these technologies are being brought in to the public spotlight.  The outcome of this case will impact the way the public views these radical technologies.

<p>My name is Richard, and I am launching my first campaign to raise funds to realize one of my dreams.

<p>I've done work raising thousands of dollars for San Francisco Women Against Rape, organized community forums to talk about street harassment under the umbrella of a group i founded, Men of African Ancestry Action Network to Unlearn Patriarchy (MAAAN UP), and blogged about anti-patriarchal / anti-sexist perspectives in a blog i wrote for 3 years called fem.men.ist.

<p>To be clear, this is not about villianizing boys and men. The heart of my mission is purely based in LOVE. Love and Accountability. I personally don't feel that i can honestly say i love women while standing by and watching the ravages of sexism and patriarchy take it's toll on them. I have seen too many women in my life suffer. Meanwhile, I am watching so many women led movements advocating for the lives of unarmed black men who are being murdered by police. Surely, it's time for me to take a bigger step for humanity during these revolutionary times. </p>
<p>And while the people who bear the brunt of the ravages of sexism and patriarchy are girls and women, i am also concerned about my woman-loving brothers, who are shortchanged on the experience of love itself. How can you truly love someone you don't respect? Or regard as an object? The voice of a man i know, who has slept with countless women, but admits that he doesn't think he has ever experienced love, echoes sadly in my head. </p>
<p><b>Men Can Stop Rape is the nation leader in Bystander Intervention / Healthy Masculinity trainings.</b> I want to take this training, to reach youth and interrupt the programming that devalues girls, devalues boys, and devalues love.

Hulse Public School.</p><p>We wanted to work with Charles H. Hulse on this because it is a beautiful school in our community with very high needs. It has such high needs because its population is mostly made up of immigrants and newcomers, with English being the second language for a lot, if not the majority, of the kids. Some of the children’s only previous experience with school has been in a refugee camp.  As a result of having a high population of immigrants and newcomers, the School Council is not able to do much fundraising, which other schools do to purchase things like technology and workshops for the kids.  We are going to donate a portion of the proceeds from the sale of our World-Changing Kids 2018 Calendar to Charles H. Hulse so they can get those extras for their students.  With your contribution towards our calendar project, you will be telling the kids at Charles H. Hulse that they are loved, supported and valued.  And they will have pride in knowing that they helped create this calendar, they did the artwork, they were agents for change for their community.  The positive impacts of this will have lasting benefits for these kids.</p><p>Your support of this calendar will help us achieve our mission of teaching children acceptance, kindness, empathy, social activism, inclusion, community engagement and peace.  We can achieve all this by simply teaching children about all members of their community - people of all skin colours, languages, religions, backgrounds, abilities and cultures.  If children are introduced to all this beautiful diversity when they are young, it will become normal.  They will learn that we are all more than same than we are different.  They will not look at some members of their community as ""others"".  There will be no ""us vs. them"".  Because this diversity will be known and valued from a young age, it will not be feared.  And often it is fear that leads to hate and racism.</p><p><strong>WHAT YOU WILL HELP US ACHIEVE: </strong></p><p><strong>Join us at the ground level of a global movement of kindness, empathy, compassion, acceptance, social activism, community engagement and peace building.</strong></p><p>This calendar project is really the launching pad for taking World-Changing Kids from the grassroots level we have been working at for the last few years to the global level.  We have been doing 10 years of field research in our community (while raising our kids), we have been building up our programs, and now we are ready to take it to the next level.

<p><strong>Emergency Business French Lessons  - An Audio Book!</strong></p>
<p>HI! My name is Simon Borland, and I'd like to tell you about how this project became a truly unexpected part of my life. When I grew up, French lessons were not on my personal agenda and I studied Maths and Physics and all manner of other subjects instead.</p>
<p>Fast forward to 2017, and I found myself living in London, with a French wife, taking frequent trips in Paris, to renovate an apartment. I had to rapidly learn how to strike various business deals in French.</p>
<p>All too often I found myself way, way out of my depth. So I tried every audio book and course book I could get on Amazon. I tried 1 to 1 tutors. I have even tried reading old Asterix and Obelix comic books in their original French language versions - (and loving them!), but nothing was really helping me fast track to sensible business-related conversations.</p>
<p><strong>What I really needed was emergency Business French lessons, as a particular need.</strong></p>
<p>And so I decided to completely change direction - I stopped seeking beginners lessons, where they were telling  me what I should learn, and instead decided to approach a professional corporate translator, <strong>a native French speaker living in Paris</strong>, with corporate experience, and<strong>  tell him</strong> all the phrases I needed.  </p>
<p>So I contacted professional language teacher and corporate translator<strong> Eric Baron, </strong>and everything changed.</p>
<p>Eric is an incredibly talented language teacher and corporate translation expert with clients all over the world. Amazon, Wondershare, financial clients, stockbrokers, financial news channels, iTrader.com, marketing campaigns, international movie translation, strategy documents, business presentations - Eric has translated them all. He started me off on a series of fast paced lessons getting straight to the core of the business related subjects I really needed to focus on. </p>
<p><strong>And so now, after hundreds of hours of intense collaboration, Eric Baron and I have put together the complete Emergency Business French language course.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Now - with your help</strong> - we are going to turn this into <strong>a fantastic audio book of 100 essential Business French Phrases,</strong> with clear and concise explanations, useful repetitions, grammar, nouns and tips. You will soon be listening and learning from a native french speaker - Eric - exactly how and why he would choose each phrase and particular wording for each situation.</p>
<p><strong>You can even CONTRIBUTE business phrases</strong> that you think would be useful, and Eric will translate them and construct lessons for the phrases you want. </p>
<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<p>OK so to achieve this we will need to raise money for the following steps</p>
<p>$1,325 for professional sound studio hire, audio engineer editing of the sound files.</p>
<p>$3,800 for professional print editing / formatting, design and layout, as a printed accompaniment to the audiobook.</p>
<p>$6,600 Limited Edition Printing of 300 Business French Phrasebooks for you</p>
<p>$1,275 graphic design various elements</p>
<p>Total Costs:  USD$13,000</p>
<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
</div><div>
<p>Eric and I believe this is a truly unique language audiobook, and will really benefit all of you who have to do any kind of business French dealings, no matter if it is in person, or by email or over the telephone.  We have been excited creating the framework and working together, and have worked painstakingly over the past 18 months to craft every single chapter and phrase for a logical progression of key words, verbs, and jargon, into a culturally nuanced and relevant teaching guide.</p>
<p><strong>The Perks</strong></p>
<p>Please browse through the options for various levels of perks: the PDF book, the audio book, the limited edition printed book, plus there are options for you to include phrases in the audio book, relevant to your industry or needs.</p>
<p>Additional perks include bespoke translation work by Eric, and also the option to have Eric work as your consultant for several days if you need a professional translator on contracts and wing-man for business negotiations or presentations, even coaching you for your own big presentation in French etc.</p>
<p><strong>The project is so close to completion - we just need your support to get into the final phase and have it professionally mastered in a sound studio, and to have the limited edition print version professionally edited.</strong></p>
<p>This is a very low risk project - we will deliver this audio book no matter what happens and all of our supporters will receive all of their perks.</p>
<p>Studio recording will take place in December 2017, Eric is heading over to London UK (from Paris) to join me for 3 days recording in a professional studio, with editing and mastering of the audio book to be completed by late January 2018 - and we anticipate the limited edition print version will be completed by March 2018.</p>

What We Need & What You Get
OK so to achieve this we will need to raise money for the following steps
$1,325 for professional sound studio hire, audio engineer editing of the sound files.
$3,800 for professional print editing / formatting, design and layout, as a printed accompaniment to the audiobook.
$6,600 Limited Edition Printing of 300 Business French Phrasebooks for you
$1,275 graphic design various elements
Total Costs:  USD$13,000
The Impact

Eric and I believe this is a truly unique language audiobook, and will really benefit all of you who have to do any kind of business French dealings, no matter if it is in person, or by email or over the telephone.  We have been excited creating the framework and working together, and have worked painstakingly over the past 18 months to craft every single chapter and phrase for a logical progression of key words, verbs, and jargon, into a culturally nuanced and relevant teaching guide.
The Perks
Please browse through the options for various levels of perks: the PDF book, the audio book, the limited edition printed book, plus there are options for you to include phrases in the audio book, relevant to your industry or needs.
Additional perks include bespoke translation work by Eric, and also the option to have Eric work as your consultant for several days if you need a professional translator on contracts and wing-man for business negotiations or presentations, even coaching you for your own big presentation in French etc.
The project is so close to completion - we just need your support to get into the final phase and have it professionally mastered in a sound studio, and to have the limited edition print version professionally edited.
This is a very low risk project - we will deliver this audio book no matter what happens and all of our supporters will receive all of their perks.
Studio recording will take place in December 2017, Eric is heading over to London UK (from Paris) to join me for 3 days recording in a professional studio, with editing and mastering of the audio book to be completed by late January 2018 - and we anticipate the limited edition print version will be completed by March 2018.

<p>Linguists study how language came into existence, where language is going, and how individual speakers are changing their own languages constantly.</p></span></div>

I'm starting a PhD in Linguistics and I need your help! In order to study for this full-time, I need to raise £5000 for my first year. If you donate, just £5, that will greatly help me pay my fees in October and throughout the year.

About Me
Everyone who knows me knows I'm a little in love with linguistics.
For those of you who don't know what linguistics actually is, I tend to describe it as the science of language. It's an awesome interdisciplinary field comprising of aspects from biology, sociology, history, psychology, literature, neuroscience, computer science, anthropology, mathematics, archaeology, and physics among others.   
Linguists study how language came into existence, where language is going, and how individual speakers are changing their own languages constantly.
I'm extremely happy to have been accepted back into the University of Stirling to work on a PhD in Linguistics.
In order to carry out this research full-time, I need £5000 for my tuition, fees, and associated travel expenses by October 2015. 




Why Metaphor?



When we talk to others about our internal thoughts, we have to find common ground - a shared framework in which to discuss those thoughts. 

I will be studying the metaphor and the linguistic systems that humans use to process information from the world around us and how we turn these thoughts into language that can be expressed to, and understood by, others.

The Impact of this Project


I believe that my research can contribute to the growing field of Linguistics from the approach of metaphor construction, social collaboration, and the importance of finding common-ground. 

Evolutionary Linguistics not only tells us about the how language came into existence, but how it is still evolving. Language is extraordinarily organized. Humans have the ability to change language to make it work for us. 
This project will provide us with deeper insights into how we, as humans, structure metaphor and how it has become a crucial device in the development of language as a whole.

This project will allow me to gain a doctorate which, in turn, will give me the knowledge and qualifications to work as a postdoctoral researcher. 

   What We Need & What You Get  
£4052 for tuition (1 year full-time or 2 years part-time)

£220 for university fees 

£300 approx. for travel expenses 

£400 approx. for books, recording equipment, and additional resources


Total Amount Required: £5000 for 1 full-time year/2 part-time years of Doctoral Research


 
If I don't reach my £5000 goal, your contribution will still be put towards my tuition and fees. However, I may study on a part-time basis in order to work to afford all expenses throughout the course. Nevertheless, your donation will be used directly for this project and will still make a HUGE difference.



Perks


If you can contribute £5, I'll handwrite a personalized postcard sent to you by snail mail. 





If you can contribute £25 or more, you will be acknowledged in print within my thesis + a handwritten postcard, i.e. you'll be immortalized in my thesis forever! 


At £75 and up, you will receive a beautiful 11""x17"" print of the Indo-European & Uralic linguistic family tree (one of my favourites!) + an acknowledgment in my thesis + a handwritten postcard.



By donating more to this project you will receive a copy of my completed thesis in e-book format (£100) or as a bound book (£500) + an acknowledgment in my thesis + a handwritten postcard.
Full details of these perks are available at the side of this page.

<p>Hello family, friends and environmental conservationists! I know some of you may know what I’ve been doing here in Guatemala, but I’d like to give you a short update and request your help! My official position here is entitled Environmental Education Intern for the Wildlife Rescue and Conservation Association ARCAS located on the pacific southwest coast of Guatemala. As the environmental education intern, I work with six local schools weekly with the hopes of developing a more sustainable and environmentally caring community for and with the people of Guatemala. </p>
<p>At ARCAS, I also assist with the sea turtle conservation project run by Lucia, Lucha and Ale. Here is a short synopsis of that program:</p>
<p>Within Guatemala there is a law that states every individual who harvests sea turtle eggs needs to give 20% donation of each nest to a Sea Turtle Hatchery —&gt; At ARCAS, we have a Tortugario (Sea Turtle Hatchery). Each night we patrol in search of sea turtles nesting on the beaches of Monterrico, but we are not the only people in search of nests. Parlamero’s, or local members of the community are also in search of eggs for a source of either income or food. When we encounter a Parlamero, we ask if they are willing to exchange the eggs they collected for two times the price in “Viveres” with a comprobante. A comprobante is basically a form that certifies the exchange, allowing members of ARCAS to protect more turtles and Parlamero’s to visit ARCAS the following day to receive the viveres or alternative sources of food for their families. </p>

<p>As the education intern I have the task of organizing educational activities and a trip called RALLY PARLAMA which promotes awareness and the importance of trash management and wildlife conservation within six different schools in Guatemala.</p>
<p>For many children, Rally Parlama is a trip of a lifetime here in Monterrico, Guatemala. Not many community members have the opportunity to travel outside of the area because of financial limitations or other barriers. </p>
<p>The students ranging in age from 9 to 14 participate in six different activities correlated to wildlife conservation and environmental awareness to qualify for one of the spots on the trip! The first 20 students (depending on how much money we raise) who complete all 6 activities, win the trip for three days and two nights to Antigua. This trip is scheduled to occur on the first weekend of December 4th-6th. Antigua is a beautiful city located approximately 2 hours Northeast of Monterrico where the students live and attend school. </p>
<p>In order to win a spot on the trip, the students must successfully and individually finish the following activities by November 30th—-&gt;</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1442349373/omqvj7pg3omr4lbweftv.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>         (Above: Estefania with her Rally Parlama activity card!)</p>
<h1>ACTIVITY 1: Find a nest</h1>
<p>Find a nest! The first activity has the students out on the beaches of Monterrico searching for a sea turtle nest of 8 dozen eggs. There are three different species of turtles which nest on the beaches of Guatemala’s Pacific Coast; Olive Ridley’s, Green, and the prehistoric Leatherback. The most commonly spotted is the Olive Ridley, or more commonly called here in Guatemala, Parlama.</p>

<h1>ACTIVITY 2: Beach clean up</h1>
<p>The students participate in a beach cleanup with me and other Staff or Volunteers from ARCAS for approximately an hour. Each School is located no more than a five minutes walk away from the beach.</p>

<h1>ACTIVITY 3: Ecoblocks </h1>
<p>Each student needs to complete 10 ecoblocks! An ecoblock is a used plastic bottle filled to the brim with what we consider garbage (i.e., soft plastic, a chip bag, a grocery bag, a candy wrapper etc.) In order to pack the trash into the plastic bottles, the students resourcefully use sticks laying around the park. Each student brings trash from the beach, road or their homes to the park in order to complete all of the ecoblocks. If they need more trash to fill their ecoblocks, we search for the trash around the park in order to fill them. Ultimately, with these bottles at ARCAS our goal is to build a library for students and other local members of the community! Yep, each individual ecoblock becomes a brick for a wall!</p>

<h1>ACTIVITY 4: Patrol with members of ARCAS! </h1>
<p>Patrolling with ARCAS members in search of a sea turtle! The students are assigned two nights to patrol with ARCAS volunteers for 2 hours each night. If they encounter a turtle, they will assist the volunteers and staff members of ARCAS, carefully put the eggs in a bag and return them to our Tortugario (Sea Turtle Hatchery)!</p>
<h1>ACTIVITY 5: Reforestation</h1>
<p>Reforestation of native trees is extremely important here at ARCAS. We have a reforestation program here called the Finca where we have planted more than 7,000 trees. In order for the students to receive a stamp for this activity, each student needs to plant 100 native species of mangrove (blanco, negro o rojo) trees with a member of ARCAS.</p>

<h1>ACTIVITY 6: Toys for our parrots!</h1>
<p>Here at ARCAS we have a captive breeding program for the highly endangered yellow naped parrots. In order to create the toys, the students and I hit the beach and surrounding area to find 100 discarded bottle caps per person. Once they’ve found 100 caps we then search for a stick and string to create a toy for the parrots!</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1442350222/fcglr8mk1vioydexeuvq.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>                         (Above: Some of our endangered yellow naped parrots)</div><div>

<h3>Risks and challenges</h3>
<p>So here’s the thing... We have these students working extremely hard each week to complete all of the activities, resulting in a cleaner earth BUT we have 20 spots and ARCAS is a nonprofit organization. The funding for this trip and the financial needs of ARCAS come from local tourists and donations from people around the world who care about the education of these pretty amazing children in Guatemala and the health of our planet. Donations like yours can help the children here become better stewards of the local environment and the population of amazing sea turtles and wildlife here in Guatemala. </p>
<p>With YOUR help, we can make it possible for the students to have an unforgettable educational trip to Antigua this year. Every dollar helps. </p>
<p>MY GOAL in regards to activities with the kids is as follows: to hike with the kids up Volcano Payaca where they will learn about this amazing land form and maybe roast a marshmallow, explore an organic coffee farm, make some chocolates at a chocolate museum and most importantly, tour a recycle factory to learn about and stress the importance of recycling!</p>
<p>We need to pay for transportation, accommodations in regards to meals and lodging for the students during the three day trip. Again, your help would be greatly appreciated by both myself, the staff at ARCAS and most importantly the children fortunate enough to take the trip.</p>

I work in the  tourism industry and I am currently study in a public Institute of vocational education and training in the field of Tourism Finance Administration. I am also study in Hellenic Open University a pre-graduate in the field of European Civilization. I am trying to raise money to restore my grandfather's windmill and eventually turn it into a museum.StoryIn old times, Windmills played a vital role in people's lives. Today, few of them remain, but those that do play an important role in our lives as cultural heritage monuments. One of these such windmills is very close to my heart, and still stands in Cephalonia, in the Ionian islands. It was built in 1926 by my grandfather and ten volunteers. It is located in Markoulata on the island of Cephalonia in Greece. It used to grind barley and wheat until 1960 when it stopped working. In the last 89 years it has survived a series of disasters, among them three devastating earthquakes (7,3 on the Richter Scale in 1952, 6,1 in 2014, 6,1 in 2015 and a fire). By the time the 1953 earthquake struck all the windmills on the island were in ruins except my Grandfather's one, and currently there is no other working windmill in the whole of Cephalonia. Some stories said that by chance my  grandfather had placed some iron supports around the windmill, which helped it not to be torn down. To this day it is still standing, but has been severely damaged by the ravages of time. It is in a dilapidated state, leaking rain water and with no sails left. Having been neglected over time, the roof leaks and the wooden mechanism in a state of desrepair.                         1956 condition                                                  Current contition



Time has come for it to be restored to its 
original specifications, making it fully operational, and turning it 
into a beautiful museum open to visitors from all over the world. The visitors will be able to admire a traditional windmill in operation, and have the opportunity to see how we used to grind the grain in the past, and learn about the history of windmills. More than 100.000 people visit Cephalonia every year. It will also be protected as a historic site and formally recognized 
by the Ministry of Culture as a museum and monument of technical heritage. I have been working on this project for many years and have done extensive 
research into renovating it and converting it into a museum and I have gathered together a team of professionals who will work together with me to make this a beautiful windmill into a 
museum. This project will cost about €200,000, which includes the rebuilding of the windmill, turning it into a museum and to build all the necessary facilities that a museum would need. I aim to initially raise €100,000, enough for the repairs of the building, building a new cap (roof), laying down a new wooden floor, and replacing the old wooden mechanisms with new ones. Changes will also be made to beautify the surrounding area, growing grass,

This is the Wales based version of Majical Youth with a ten year lease on the woodland walk at Pengraig Farm.An eco friendly gathering/camp site which includes composting toilets, borehole water supply, solar shower block and even a pirate ship adventure play area with a mahooosive sand pit! With the community based on the farm we fund-raised for, designed and planted a forest garden and woodland for firewood coppicing. This is now 6 years old                 We have forged links within the local community and know that our work there is helping keep this rural community alive and attractive for the up coming generations. Our activities were bringing employment and prosperity to the local area which has been listed as an area of rural deprivation.We have organically managed the land at Pengraig for ten years and have re planted the grazing fields  (when necessary) with a pioneering conservation mix of  grasses, that is showing good results AND the local farmers are now happy with it :) We have also developed the hedges as wildlife corridors to increase Bio-diversity and brought in bees and... to be honest we had only just begun...our intention is to promote a system at our new base detailed in the videos below.(farm for the future  https://youtu.be/qVBYgg013KM )(permaculture in practise  https://youtu.be/qVBYgg013KM)We also intend to be offering Permaculture design courses and increasing on site food production for residents and visitors,                                                                                                We have now formed a pioneering multi stakeholder co-operative to take the project forward.( P.E.A.C ) is to manage the farm and provide a community base to home educating families. They will be able to engage in Majical Youth,activities as well as run separate ""micro"" businesses. increase local job availabilityFUTURE PLANS....We have more kids camps lined up waiting to use a gathering site,  but as it is becoming prohibitively expensive to hire it, everything is on hold until we raise the money to buy a new site. The gathering site has also played host to numerous other child and youth camps, retreats and community events working with MajicalYouth we will now need to rebuild that gathering site when we move, so we can carry on making it available to other community groups in need, for a peppercorn rent.We will be setting up a healing retreat centre for disaffected vulnerable young adults  with trained counsellors on board and healthy stimulating projects to engage with.We will be running respite care in the style of a ""care farm"" for learning disabled adults based around a permaculture bio dynamic gardening project. including simple carpentry projects and other stimulating useful creative activities.We aim to buy enough land to host  a 'low impact eco hamlet'.  we intend to facilitate a One Planet Development eco hamlet, similar to the Lammas project in West Wales. We already have local, council and Welsh assembly support. We have been preparing this bid for over a year already, a community land trust will eventually own its site providing eco housing to local families, individual freehold plots will also be available in the future we hope!We have more ""MICRO"" businesses linked to majical youth and the community waiting to come use our facilities, including toy designers and craft workers and a team of forest school leaders waiting to start using a bush craft site for their activities.WE NEED A FARM AS A BASE OR NONE OF THIS CAN CONTINUE AND                                                                     DEVELOP........                                                                                            

WHAT HAPPENS NOW WE CANT BUY OUR FARM?....WE HAVE TILL 31st OCTOBER to find a base
 We are now so committed to our over all project that we have elected to CARRY ON REGARDLESS! Although it is a huge blow that we cannot now buy the base we have spent 10 years developing, we will seek to buy somewhere else to continue our work there, but it will mean starting from scratch...absolute proof we need to buy our own land could not be more self evident to us if it tried...it took ten years to get it running properly at Pengraig! It's make or break time for these 4 compatible youth and community organisations in Wales... your donations will be used to help the four projects find a new home. 

If you wish to leave your money in the fund under these circumstances, we thank you :) ,if you would like it returned (minus paypal handling fee) that is not a problem and we still thank you for helping us to try and realise a long held dream :)

WHAT WE HAVE DONE IN THE PAST.....
We have completed a number of projects during our time at the farm, these include:- 
The Eco Extreme Kids Camp-to help break down social barriers between teenage gangs.
Millennium Volunteers project.
The design, fundraising for and build of Merlin's Way-disabled accessible woodland walk and sensory garden, a project designed by local teenagers, for the benefit of the whole community.
The teenagers yurt building and film camp.
On Yer Bike- recycling push bikes project.
Walkabout teenage theatre team workshop and rehearsal studio for Glastonbury Festival.
Working with teenagers on work experience, to provide a children's play area at festivals and community events.
Project managers training course for local teenagers.
Travellers Aid Trust outdoor events training programme for young travellers.
The manifestation of the Wales Environmental Home Education Camp.
The creation of Circus Camp Cymru.
The manifestation of Women's Retreats Wales.
The designing, fundraising for, and building of a forest garden permaculture site.
Providing activities in the woods to Princes Youth Trust and local youth offending teams.
Work experience for under 25's, and references where appropriate.
'Big Time' inner city youth projects with the St Paul's Full Circle Project.  
The Party With a Purpose Project, which redesigned a local skate park, hosted a ""half pipe"" in the barns and designed a woodland walk with local teenagers, and also supported and empowered numerous other,local youth led initiatives.

These activities have, by all accounts, empowered teenagers and families to go onto brighter futures, where they have re-engaged with their communities, RE entered education and been helped towards employment. We often get visits from the ""old"" youth to see how THEIR project is still doing. WE HAVE JUST HAD CONFIRMATION THAT A LOCAL SIGNWRITER WILL PAINT THE LITTLE BUS AND WE WILL BE OFFERING TO HAVE YOUR COMPANY NAME AND LOGO ON ITS SIDE GET IN TOUCH IF YOU ARE INTERESTED.....XXX

TESTIMONIALS...
""I have never had time on my hands with the children until I came to a work weekend on the farm and the kids were so busy I learnt woodcarving and carved a stool.""
""I was in a rut, depressed and had such low self esteem till I met Majical Youth who inspired me to volunteer for local community groups, I now run a charity shop and have my own business to boot!""
""I was taking drugs and homeless when I first met Majical Youth. Since then I've been back to college with their support and I'm hoping to run a tree surgery business.""
I went back to collage thanks to Majical Youth, and now I come back to help out as a volunteer and share my skills with the ""next lot""
""I got a qualification via Majical Youth and work experience that has helped me get a full time job with a marquee company.""
""Majical Youth people are so much fun and very caring, I would definitely recommend them to any one running an event as the best kids area ever!"" their sign saying ""warning this field may contain nuts"" was so very true, they had us all in stitches!""

<p>This will get the Truck on the road. It will build a website and load it up with all kinds of talk. </p>
<p>If we raise half this amount, we will fill the Truck with half the languages (24 instead of the 48 shown on the Truck's side panel), </p>
<p>If we raise a quarter of this amount, we will load it up with 12 languages, and pro rata thereafter.</p>
<p>If we do manage 12 languages, this will put us in a great position. It will enable us to fund the Language Truck into the future by selling its products - languages. </p>
<p>We will never sell languages individually! We want people to enjoy access to all of them at once. </p>
<p>We will then increase the cargo as we move forward.</p>

<p>'Listen up, kids, we all know how important good grades are. They give us a better start in our working lives, right? Well, here's a little something that might help you with that.

In the north, following the Saharan routes of trade and travel are the Afro-Asiatic Linguistic groups. Mid-Saharan and extending southward into North Central Africa are the Nilo-Saharan languages.

might have about us, and vice versa. 



FUNFACT! 

Languages are really hard to learn.
Two-year-olds can manage them easily enough but anyone
younger than that can only understand coochycoochycooooo! when said by mothers in hundreds of countries.

This is how focused we are. 
Eventually, when the Truck has been round the clock a few times, and when we have the money to fund it, we would like to add other languages. 


Like these:

African Language Family Groups
African Languages fall into four basic families following ancient migratory patterns of influence. In the north, following the Saharan routes of trade and travel are the Afro-Asiatic Linguistic groups. Mid-Saharan and extending southward into North Central Africa are the Nilo-Saharan languages. From Western Africa (south of the Sahara) to Southeast Africa is the Niger-Kordofanian family of languages. And finally, in Southwest Africa are the Khoisan languages.
Afro-Asiatic

Arabic
Kushite
Amaharic
Afro-Asian
Berber

Nilo-Saharan

Chadian
Eastern Sudanic
Eastern Adamawa
Songhay

Niger-Kordofanian

Mande
Voltic
Kwa
Bantu-Congo

Khoisan

San
Khoi

When a kid in Africa was recently asked what his idea of heaven was, he replied:
 'A big American supermarket.' 
His greatest wish was to take his mom in and fill her cart to scrumptious overflowingness!
Besides giving free access to the Language Truck to charities, we will also load its languages onto discs, for them to use in places where broadband is but a distant dream. Folk will be able to access the truck. And they won't need a teacher.
That's why we put images in School 1. We put them in for those who don't know any of the Truck's languages. If they read the word 'pencil' in 48 languages, or hear it spoken in 4 dozen tongues, it won't mean a thing. Until they look at the image. Then they'll go: 'Ah.....So that's what that's called in English.....' We aim to load the Truck with every image we can click a mouse on.


Be part of
it…
Help us make it happen!
Help bring down Babble!
Help us help
people communicate…
How else can you help?
Ask your Friends to tell their Friends!

</div></div>","Inspire Initiative Limited 
Inspire Initiative Limited (under the logo ‘Inspire – for the love of mountains’) is a charitable organisation founded in 2014 and supporting primary education in Gilgit-Baltistan region of Pakistan. The Founder & Chief Executive, Bushra Farooqui has been working with schools (promoting girls’ education) in this region since 2009 but has recently given it a formal structure under the Inspire charity. The motivation behind running a primary school in this beautiful mountainous region is the collective love of mountains, trekking and child (especially girls) education!
‘Investing in Education is the Greatest Return!’
We believe that every child deserves access to and the best opportunities for quality education and learning. We want to see children learning skills that will help them earn their own livelihood and break the cycle of poverty and dependency. We also want to see them getting a chance to cherish their childhood days, play, build long lasting friendships and freely express their creativity!

Aims and Objectives:




Our main aim is to provide quality education to children who cannot afford to go to schools at all. The Inspire Sadpara & Malpan Primary Schools today provides primary education to 180 children both girls and boys between the ages of 4 to 14 years. These are children from remote Sadpara valley in Baltistan who are from under privileged backgrounds and cannot even afford the nominal fee of the government school. Their parents earn their livelihood by farming and raising cattle. Most of our children have to leave school by the age of 12 to help their parents earn a living. We aspire to give them a taste of childhood while they are with us and enough education to want to better their lives.


We work with community leaders to establish Village Education Committees (VECs) that hire local teachers and help enroll children in school.


The overall support provided by Inspire Initiative consists of teacher salaries and professional development, school supplies and materials, uniforms, school maintenance and development. Above all we try our best to ensure a child-friendly learning environment!


The secondary aim is to promote the beautiful mountainous Gilgit-Baltistan region of Pakistan through involvement in community development projects, organizing awareness building talk sessions and participating in charity treks in Pakistan and other countries.


Our focus for 2015-16 is to sustain funding received through the Inspire-a-Child sponsor scheme and other donors as well as consider potential local & international funding opportunities.


In addition to the above, our focus remains on enhancing the quality of education by introducing teacher training programs, as well as curriculum development and assessment. For this we have partnered with Aga Khan Education Services, Pakistan who will provide all of the above services.


   What We Need?
There are two projects that we're currently working on: 


Adopting a new Nursery School for 2016

Extension of a School building to add two more Classes.



The School that we plan to adopt:







The School that we plan to extend:





The beautiful mountains in the surroundings of the School:




We have set a target of collecting $10,000. The amount is attainable and adequate to achieve the above mentioned objectives. We firmly believe that only Education can help break the shackles of Poverty and bring about a Socioeconomic change in Pakistan. By donating to this cause, YOU will be directly helping the children of Gilgit Baltistan in getting educated. No amount is too little to donate. We assure that each and every Dollar will help us achieve our objectives. And, it's not the amount that matters, it's the intention that counts. YOU can change lives!

I am Madiha Batool and I want to become a Teacher when I grow up! - (Class 4, Inspire Sadpara Primary School, Baltistan)


I am Zeeshan Ali and I want to become a Pilot when I grow up! - (Class 1, Inspire Sadpara Primary School, Baltistan)

<h3>What's A MakerSpace?</h3>
<p>A MakerSpace is a creative, Do It Yourself space where people can gather to create, invent, and learn. They often have 3D printers, software, electronics, craft supplies, power tools, <i>and more</i>. </p>
<p><b>The</b> <b>CoasterDad MakerSpace</b> is all that and more, <i>and more, and more</i>!  In response to feedback from thousands of CoasterDad fans, we're building a space to bring Physics, Family and Fun to Kids Everywhere. Will we build roller coasters? Naturally! But that's not all. The CoasterDad MakerSpace will be a wonderful place where kids and grownups can</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>Learn STEM and STEAM techniques and skills through hands-on, gently guided and self-directed classes, collaboration, and activities</li>
<li>Connect with other kids and their grownups who share similar interests and have the same kinds of questions</li>
<li><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Build robots and drones to do wonderful and amazing things that kids really love. Ever heard of Game of Drones? BattleBots? Yeah. Us, too. </span></li>
<li><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Invent kooky new things with Science-y tools like 3D Printers, laser cutters, welding equipment, hand tools, power tools, micro-controllers, and computers</span></li>
<li>Learn YouTube Video Production skills to create a unique YouTube Channel, or collaborate with others to contribute knowledge to the second largest search engine on Earth.</li>
<li>Find adult mentors and teachers to help develop the skills and knowledge that <i>you</i> think is important</li>
<li>Host events like Birthday Parties for kids and  even fancy, catered events for grownups.</li>
</ul>
<div>That's just a short list of what's already going on at The CoasterDad Project, which was founded by <a href=""https://goo.gl/g2BWws"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""CoasterDad,"" Will Pemble</a>. </div>

</div> <p>Once Upon A Time, Will Pemble's son Lyle asked a simple question. ""Wouldn't it be cool if we had a roller coaster in our backyard?""  Inspired by the idea, Will got to work. Three months later, to the delight of every kid in the neighborhood, Will's first roller coaster, ""The Caution Zone,"" was complete. Throughout the project, Will documented his progress on <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/willpemble"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">YouTube Channel</a>.

Most recently, the CoasterDad Project won Four Editors Choice Blue Ribbons at the 2015 Maker Faire Bay Area, where Will and the CoasterDad Team built a full-sized, interactive roller coaster exhibit to show kids and their grownups just how much can be learned in the world of ""Physics, Family and Fun."" </p>

</div>
<p>Just like a roller coaster, we need your help getting to the top of that first hill. For The CoasterDad MakerSpace, that's mostly about equipment, and a little about operating capital as well. </p>
<p><br/><b><i>Our First Target is $15,000</i></b>, which we'll use for</p> <ul> <li>Laser Cutter</li>
<li>3D Printers</li>
<li>Arduino &amp; Robotics Lab</li> </ul>
<div>Our founder, CoasterDad Will Pemble has a little workshop filled with big tools. Will is happy to donate all of it to The CoasterDad MakerSpace. Those tools include</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Table Saw</li>
<li>Pneumatic nail nun</li>

<li>2 GoPro Hero Action Cameras</li>
<li>1 Time lapse camera</li>
<li>Three 27"" iMac Computers with all the trimmings</li>
<li>and more.</li>
</ul>
<div>So, yes.  Quite a lot of The CoasterDad MakerSpace equipment already exists. When it comes to Bringing Physics, Family and Fun to Kids Everywhere, Will is all in. </div>
</div>
<div><i><b>Our Stretch Goal is $25,000</b></i></div>
<div>Our target goal will provide the funds and equipment we need to get The CoasterDad MakerSpace up and running. If you help our campaign raise more, we'll do more! More equipment, more programs, more outreach to kids and grownups who will surely benefit from our programs and offerings. We'll also purchase additional tools, such as</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Drillpress</li>
<li>Metal lathe</li>
<li>Wood lathe</li>
<li>Drone training kits</li>
</ul>
<div><i><b>Our Super Stretch Goal is $35,000</b></i></div>
</div>
<div>That'd be crazy awesome, right? Thirty-five thousand dollars to spend on teaching kids the things that kids want to learn! At this level, we'll add two incredible things to The CoasterDad MakerSpace.</div>
<div><ul>
<li><span style=""background-color: initial;"">A cooking studio</span></li>
<li>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">A slow motion camera</span><span style=""background-color: initial;""> </span>
</li>
<li><span style=""background-color: initial;"">YouTube Learning Center</span></li>
</ul></div>
<div>Totally unrelated things, except that they're kind of pricey. A moderately priced slow motion camera can shoot video at thousands of frames per second. In addition to being amazingly cool, SloMo is also an incredibly good way to get kids thinking in terms of the micro-world around them. Understanding just how much can happen in a thousandth of a blink of an eye opens up the mind to worlds of possibility. The CoasterDad MakerSpace will offer a Super SlowMo class to amaze, engage, and yes, to educate kids about MicroTime. </div>
<div>Ever seen a cooking show on TV or YouTube? Cooking isn't just great fun, and it isn't just a crucial life skill. Cooking is a language unto itself. Cooking opens up the worlds of chemistry, creativity, communication and the arts. A Cooking Studio at The CoasterDad MakerSpace would enhance those already stellar experiences by adding the opportunity for our students and members to create their own Cooking Shows, which they can enjoy in private, or even publish on YouTube. </div>
<div>Oooh! What if we did a Cooking Show... in SlowMo!  See? We just thought of that! We thought of it because That's What A MakerSpace Can Do. A MakerSpace Opens The Mind and allows for infinite often unlikely connections. Looks like a cooking studio and a slow motion camera aren't so totally unrelated after all. </div> </div> <div> <h3><br/></h3>
<h3>STEM &amp; STEAM Learning For Everyone</h3> <p></p>
<p>Whether you're a grownup, a kid, or somewhere in between, now is always the best time to learn something new.  </p>
<p>Preparing kids for careers Science, Technology, Engineering Art, and Math (STEM/STEAM) is the very best way we know to ensure that the next generation is active, aware, and engaged with the kinds of innovation and creativity that fuel personal, social, and economic growth. </p>
<p>For adults, we're creating a variety of classes and memberships to help you build new skills and hone your existing ones. The MakerSpace community, both online and at the CoasterDad MakerSpace facility, closes the loop and keeps you in touch with like minds and complimentary skill sets. </p>
<p>In addition to competitively priced classes and memberships, The CoasterDad Project aims to provide free learning opportunities for low-income adults and children, through scholarships and free training programs.  Your support will help these programs - and these <i>people</i> - to continue and grow.</p>

<h3>501(c)3 + You = Education</h3>
<p>Though Will Pemble is an experienced, successful entrepreneur, The CoasterDad Project wasn't started as a business. The CoasterDad Project started out as Will's gift to his children, Ellie and Lyle. </p>
<p>To the delight of millions, Will's videos, interactive learning experiences, and the articles he's published on topics like Project Based Learning are helping kids to learn, and grownups to teach. Will insists that The CoasterDad Project, and The CoasterDad MakerSpace, continues to be a gift. Not only to his kids, but to all kids, all parents. </p>
<p>As the Maker Movement as grown, so has the popularity and impact of Will's videos. Will's goal, however, has never changed: Bring Physics, Family and Fun to Kids Everywhere. We're organizing The CoasterDad MakerSpace as a non-profit to keep our goals and purpose clear. You can be sure that your contribution to this important work will be used to the benefit of the kids, community, and projects we serve. </p>
<div><br/></div>
<h3>CoasterDad Is Local <i>and</i> Global</h3>
<p>The CoasterDad MakerSpace will be located in Concord, California. People from all over the Bay Area will have access to our classes, tools, people and resources. We envision a vibrant community where members become makers, and students become teachers. We know that hands-on experience is the best way to learn.</p>
<p>We also know that sharing content, ideas, and lessons online is a great way to teach. That's where The CoasterDad MakerSpace Video Production Shop fits in. Just like CoasterDad Will Pemble has been doing to the tune of millions of YouTube views for years now, we aim to continue Bringing Physics, Family and Fun to Kids Everywhere through our YouTube presence.</p>
<p>All our classes will be produced as Online Learning Modules and offered For Free to anyone who wants them. Providing valuable, meaningful education to anyone who wants it is simply the best investment we can think to make in our community, our children, our future. This desire, this passion, is at the very core of The CoasterDad Project, and we need your help to.. well, help :)</p>
<br/>
</div> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>The CoasterDad Team is experienced in every facet of the operation of this project. We've run technical training businesses that taught thousands of students. We're certified project and product managers. We're moms and dads. Will is certified in all kinds of things, including technical training, behavioral analysis, flight instruction, personal training, and too many other things to list here. We're experienced businesspeople who know how to win. We're award winning customer service providers. Will was the founding CEO of Web.com, one of the biggest web hosting companies in the world.

<p>So, yes. We're up to the challenge. We're also experienced enough to know that plans don't always go to plan. We're okay with that. Mistakes get made, schedules push. We're ready to work as hard and as long as it takes to realize our vision. We're also ready to promise deliverables carefully, and to keep those promises. Challenges are met, and problems get solved through communication, realistic expectations in the first place, and above all, perseverance.

</div></div>","What's A MakerSpace?
A MakerSpace is a creative, Do It Yourself space where people can gather to create, invent, and learn. They often have 3D printers, software, electronics, craft supplies, power tools, and more. 
The CoasterDad MakerSpace is all that and more, and more, and more!  In response to feedback from thousands of CoasterDad fans, we're building a space to bring Physics, Family and Fun to Kids Everywhere. Will we build roller coasters? Naturally! But that's not all. The CoasterDad MakerSpace will be a wonderful place where kids and grownups can


Learn STEM and STEAM techniques and skills through hands-on, gently guided and self-directed classes, collaboration, and activities
Connect with other kids and their grownups who share similar interests and have the same kinds of questions
Build robots and drones to do wonderful and amazing things that kids really love. Ever heard of Game of Drones? BattleBots? Yeah. Us, too. 
Invent kooky new things with Science-y tools like 3D Printers, laser cutters, welding equipment, hand tools, power tools, micro-controllers, and computers
Learn YouTube Video Production skills to create a unique YouTube Channel, or collaborate with others to contribute knowledge to the second largest search engine on Earth.
Find adult mentors and teachers to help develop the skills and knowledge that you think is important
Host events like Birthday Parties for kids and  even fancy, catered events for grownups.

That's just a short list of what's already going on at The CoasterDad Project, which was founded by ""CoasterDad,"" Will Pemble. 


It All Started With A Roller Coaster
 Once Upon A Time, Will Pemble's son Lyle asked a simple question. ""Wouldn't it be cool if we had a roller coaster in our backyard?""  Inspired by the idea, Will got to work. Three months later, to the delight of every kid in the neighborhood, Will's first roller coaster, ""The Caution Zone,"" was complete. Throughout the project, Will documented his progress on YouTube Channel. Hundreds of videos, thousands of subscribers, and millions of views later, The CoasterDad Project is a real thing.




From the start, The CoasterDad Project has had no shortage of coverage on television, in blogs, newspapers, and social media. Google Will Pemble, and you'll see for yourself just how much passion and commitment he brings to the work. 
Will and his projects have been covered on Good Morning America, Discovey Channel Canada, CBS News, NBC News, ABC News, and dozens of television stations worldwide. Will has been featured in hundreds of online media outlets, including AOL.com, Hackaday.com, Popular Science, Popular Mechanics, Make Magazine, Edutopia, just to name a few. Most recently, the CoasterDad Project won Four Editors Choice Blue Ribbons at the 2015 Maker Faire Bay Area, where Will and the CoasterDad Team built a full-sized, interactive roller coaster exhibit to show kids and their grownups just how much can be learned in the world of ""Physics, Family and Fun."" 

What We Need  



Just like a roller coaster, we need your help getting to the top of that first hill. For The CoasterDad MakerSpace, that's mostly about equipment, and a little about operating capital as well. 
Our First Target is $15,000, which we'll use for  Laser Cutter
3D Printers
Arduino & Robotics Lab 
Our founder, CoasterDad Will Pemble has a little workshop filled with big tools. Will is happy to donate all of it to The CoasterDad MakerSpace. Those tools include


Table Saw
Pneumatic nail nun
Pneumatic impact wrench
Pneumatic staple gun
Right angle drills
Skill saw
Sawzall
Dremels
Air compressor
Router and router table
Compound mitre saw
Saw horses
Hand tools
Cordless drills
Welding machine
Pipe benders




Steel chop saw
Welding helmet and gloves
Angle grinder
Skill saw
Dual grinding wheel
Video Studio Lights
2 HD Video Cameras
2 GoPro Hero Action Cameras
1 Time lapse camera
Three 27"" iMac Computers with all the trimmings
and more.

So, yes.  Quite a lot of The CoasterDad MakerSpace equipment already exists. When it comes to Bringing Physics, Family and Fun to Kids Everywhere, Will is all in. 

Our Stretch Goal is $25,000
Our target goal will provide the funds and equipment we need to get The CoasterDad MakerSpace up and running. If you help our campaign raise more, we'll do more! More equipment, more programs, more outreach to kids and grownups who will surely benefit from our programs and offerings. We'll also purchase additional tools, such as


Drillpress
Metal lathe
Wood lathe
Drone training kits

Our Super Stretch Goal is $35,000

That'd be crazy awesome, right? Thirty-five thousand dollars to spend on teaching kids the things that kids want to learn! At this level, we'll add two incredible things to The CoasterDad MakerSpace.

A cooking studio

A slow motion camera 

YouTube Learning Center

Totally unrelated things, except that they're kind of pricey. A moderately priced slow motion camera can shoot video at thousands of frames per second. In addition to being amazingly cool, SloMo is also an incredibly good way to get kids thinking in terms of the micro-world around them. Understanding just how much can happen in a thousandth of a blink of an eye opens up the mind to worlds of possibility. The CoasterDad MakerSpace will offer a Super SlowMo class to amaze, engage, and yes, to educate kids about MicroTime. 
Ever seen a cooking show on TV or YouTube? Cooking isn't just great fun, and it isn't just a crucial life skill. Cooking is a language unto itself. Cooking opens up the worlds of chemistry, creativity, communication and the arts. A Cooking Studio at The CoasterDad MakerSpace would enhance those already stellar experiences by adding the opportunity for our students and members to create their own Cooking Shows, which they can enjoy in private, or even publish on YouTube. 
Oooh! What if we did a Cooking Show... in SlowMo!  See? We just thought of that! We thought of it because That's What A MakerSpace Can Do. A MakerSpace Opens The Mind and allows for infinite often unlikely connections. Looks like a cooking studio and a slow motion camera aren't so totally unrelated after all.    
STEM & STEAM Learning For Everyone 
Whether you're a grownup, a kid, or somewhere in between, now is always the best time to learn something new.  
Preparing kids for careers Science, Technology, Engineering Art, and Math (STEM/STEAM) is the very best way we know to ensure that the next generation is active, aware, and engaged with the kinds of innovation and creativity that fuel personal, social, and economic growth. 
For adults, we're creating a variety of classes and memberships to help you build new skills and hone your existing ones. The MakerSpace community, both online and at the CoasterDad MakerSpace facility, closes the loop and keeps you in touch with like minds and complimentary skill sets. 
In addition to competitively priced classes and memberships, The CoasterDad Project aims to provide free learning opportunities for low-income adults and children, through scholarships and free training programs.  Your support will help these programs - and these people - to continue and grow.




501(c)3 + You = Education
Though Will Pemble is an experienced, successful entrepreneur, The CoasterDad Project wasn't started as a business. The CoasterDad Project started out as Will's gift to his children, Ellie and Lyle. 
To the delight of millions, Will's videos, interactive learning experiences, and the articles he's published on topics like Project Based Learning are helping kids to learn, and grownups to teach. Will insists that The CoasterDad Project, and The CoasterDad MakerSpace, continues to be a gift. Not only to his kids, but to all kids, all parents. 
As the Maker Movement as grown, so has the popularity and impact of Will's videos. Will's goal, however, has never changed: Bring Physics, Family and Fun to Kids Everywhere. We're organizing The CoasterDad MakerSpace as a non-profit to keep our goals and purpose clear. You can be sure that your contribution to this important work will be used to the benefit of the kids, community, and projects we serve. 

CoasterDad Is Local and Global
The CoasterDad MakerSpace will be located in Concord, California. People from all over the Bay Area will have access to our classes, tools, people and resources. We envision a vibrant community where members become makers, and students become teachers. We know that hands-on experience is the best way to learn.
We also know that sharing content, ideas, and lessons online is a great way to teach. That's where The CoasterDad MakerSpace Video Production Shop fits in. Just like CoasterDad Will Pemble has been doing to the tune of millions of YouTube views for years now, we aim to continue Bringing Physics, Family and Fun to Kids Everywhere through our YouTube presence.
All our classes will be produced as Online Learning Modules and offered For Free to anyone who wants them. Providing valuable, meaningful education to anyone who wants it is simply the best investment we can think to make in our community, our children, our future. This desire, this passion, is at the very core of The CoasterDad Project, and we need your help to.. well, help :)

   Risks & Challenges The CoasterDad Team is experienced in every facet of the operation of this project. We've run technical training businesses that taught thousands of students. We're certified project and product managers. We're moms and dads. Will is certified in all kinds of things, including technical training, behavioral analysis, flight instruction, personal training, and too many other things to list here. We're experienced businesspeople who know how to win. We're award winning customer service providers. Will was the founding CEO of Web.com, one of the biggest web hosting companies in the world. Our latest roller coaster won 4 Blue Ribbons at Maker Faire Bay Area 2015. Will is a featured, master maker according to makezine.com.  
So, yes. We're up to the challenge. We're also experienced enough to know that plans don't always go to plan. We're okay with that. Mistakes get made, schedules push. We're ready to work as hard and as long as it takes to realize our vision. We're also ready to promise deliverables carefully, and to keep those promises. Challenges are met, and problems get solved through communication, realistic expectations in the first place, and above all, perseverance. For The CoasterDad MakerSpace, we'll bring our A Game, and we'll keep on keeping on. GRIT is one of the many crucial lessons we aim to teach our members and our students.

The refugee is taught the skills and knowledge he/she actually wants to learn.
The Impact
TNKR has been operating since 2013 with only volunteers and minimal donations. We have had over 200 refugees go through our tutoring program.
This program has also attracted the hearts of people all over the world. We have had over 300 volunteers from different backgrounds, ages, and skills, and it's a grassroots project on the ground, managed locally in Seoul.
What We Need
We want to grow TNKR, and we need your support. We currently have 50+ refugees on our waiting list to begin tutoring, and the organization is ready to expand. 

With this money we plan to:
- begin the North Korean Education Fund, so we can provide scholarships and help find internship and career opportunities that matter 
- create Homework Helper support where refugees can come and seek help with their English courses
- put on our 3rd Speech Competition where refugees are able to share their story and win monetary prizes (Our founders have donated $3,000 to put on the first speech contest.)
- get our own space where refugees and tutors can meet (It costs $10 for each tutoring session when they have to individually rent out private spaces) 
Any donation will be beneficial and allow TNKR to expand its reach!

<p></p>We are FRC Team 4534, the Wired Wizards. <i>FIRST</i> Robotics Competition 
(FRC) is a worldwide competition where high school students have 6 weeks
 to design, build, and program a fully-functioning, 120lb, remote 
controllable robot to compete against other robots in a game of 
intelligence, cunning, and strategy. We are based in Wilmington, North 
Carolina, and we accept any high school student from any school, 
including home-school.<br/><br/><small>For more information about <i>FIRST</i>, check out <a href=""http://usfirst.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://usfirst.org</a>.</small><br/><p></p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p></p>
<p>We need your support to go to competition this year. We have a 
fundraising goal of $5,000 this year to go to our district competitions and regional championship. NC FIRST Robotics has recently moved to a <a href=""http://www.ncfirstrobotics.org/files/1114/2930/5402/NC_District_Model_Overview.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">new district model</a>, allowing us to compete at two competitions (over the previous years single competition model) for a lower cost. The 
$5,000 that we raise through IndieGoGo will pay for our registration at the district level.  This registration is due on November 23rd, 2015. Any donation you make allows you the opportunity to select <i>Perks, </i>which are small tokens of our appreciation for helping our cause. To receive a perk, you must select it at checkout. If you select a perk, be sure to provide a valid email address so we can contact you if there are any problems, or if we need a business logo from you, for example.<br/></p>
<h3>Stretch Goals</h3>
<p>In the event we meet our bare-minimum $5,000 goal, we still have much further to go. We have stretch goals listed here that will make competing easier for our team.</p>
<p><b>$8,500 - Robot Costs<br/></b>If we raise an additional $3,500, we can afford to pay for all the parts for our bot and build a practice bot to work on after bag-n-tag date!</p>
<p><b>$10,000 - Marketing and Competition Resources<br/></b>Marketing in a First Robotics Competition is more than fliers and buttons. Students must market themselves to other teams in order to attract and build alliances. This additional budget will support materials to increase team awareness in the community as well as giving us a bigger presence in competition.</p>
<p><b>$20,000 - Travel Costs<br/></b>As you might imagine, travelling for 2-3 days with 30 high school kids plus chaperons and equipment can get expensive quick.  This year we have not one, but two guaranteed competitions that will demand travel. This stretch goal will fund our two trips and ensure we can keep all students fed and well rested while on the road!</p>

</div><p>Akwaaba! Hello friends, family and international community!
My name is Benjamin Cohn, and I have been living and studying in Ghana for the
last 9 months on a Fulbright-mtvU Fellowship.  While researching music and
the effects that it has on the people, their culture and politics, I have
become even more convinced of the necessity of music education for the youth.
Fostering self-expression and creativity is an essential part of personal and
community development and since music was removed from the core curriculum in
public schools, the work of places like the Bizung School of Music and Dance is more important
than ever.</p>
<p>My research has produced countless interviews, essays and
articles reinforcing music’s power to enact positive change in communities big
and small. Education is an essential component of using that power to
its full extent. I am partnering with <span>Mohammed Alidu</span>, <span>Founder and Creative Director of the <span>BizungSchool of Music &amp;</span></span>Dance, to help expand their operation and provide more children
in Northern Ghana with access to quality music education. This project
will provide a more tangible and immediate contribution to the Ghanaian
community, and the people who have taught me so much.</p>
<p>Upon its founding in 2010, Alidu, as he's known to the students, named it after the talking drum chiefs, the ""Bizung"", who have
lived in the area for more than 1,000 years. Today, the school employs 9
teachers with about 200 kids served, providing a nursery for the young, that runs
most of the day, and the formal after-school classes for students aged 8+.
These classes teach Ghanaian youth traditional and modern instruments and
musical skills such as the xylophone, piano, drum and guitar; component
notation; dance; and others.  Bizung has done an amazing job serving the
immediate community in Tamale, but there are areas of need that we can help
both locally and regionally. First, they need more guitars to replace old and
broken ones as well as to serve more students.  Furthermore, Alidu has big plans for the school and the first step towards expansion is a van. The entire region lacks music education and a new van will allow Bizung to bring more students to the school, and bring musicians and teachers to more remote, outlying areas. It will help keep operations sustainable by providing new sources of income (rentals) and creating jobs in the community (drivers).</p>
<p>The three main goals for this expansion campaign:</p>
<p>1. 10 New guitars (5 acoustic, 3 bass, 2 electric) costing roughly
$1600 (6,400 GHS)</p>
<p>2. New van to help with transportation needs costing roughly $3,500 (12,000 GHS)</p>
<p>3. Money for maintenance of items 1 and 2 costing
roughly $1000 (4,000 GHS)</p>
<p>It is my aim to fund all three of these goals over the next
6 weeks but even accomplishing just one will be a major help to Bizung. Any
donation, (no matter how big!) is appreciated and if you cannot support
financially, please spread word about the campaign! </p>
