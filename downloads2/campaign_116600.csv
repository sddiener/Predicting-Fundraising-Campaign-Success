<h3> Welcome to <em>Inferna</em>—the richly textured, mysterious, and strangely knowable world that poet Stefene Russell inhabits so completely. In this poem-cycle’s nine sections—each with its own “tiny outfit,” idiosyncratic boyfriend, and keyhole to peer out of—Russell’s language soars and dives, and the rising and falling of so much sheer music is exhilarating. Her seemingly effortless lines are measured human breaths. They’re smart <em>and</em> they’re felt. Her images are well-honed blades or luxurious blankets; they startle or they comfort—depending.</h3>
<h3> You’ll watch “the shadows / leap and fall on the walls of / the carnival tent.” You’ll hear the mockingbird (hers is an “emergency mockingbird, mind you) “singing to you, the same tune / over and over: that one / about someone stealing your car.” You’ll be a witness “as Peetie Wheatstraw’s / ghost strums / Santa Claus Blues / from a cold / blue star.”</h3>
<h3> <em>Inferna </em>is absolute magic-making at its most lucid. There’s nothing abstract or unduly dreamy about this dream of a life. Russell gives us some remarkable hope: that it is indeed possible to articulate what too often threatens to remain ineffable. And she’s not shy about what she wants out of the deal: “Alleys are my city’s secret pockets. / I want the whole sky and all the wine in your house, / and all the wine in your neighbor’s house.”</h3>
<h3> And why not? <em>Inferna</em> is itself so intoxicating. This is vintage Stefene Russell—and I promise there will be no easy sleeping it off. Hers is one of the most distinctive voices in this or any town. Inferna is a bad dream gone awfully good. <em>Inferna</em> is a flat-out wonder.</h3>
<h3> I’m here stealing one of Russell’s lines from her opening poem on the carnival midway: “Dazzle, Dazzle, Huzzah.” That’s what this book does, and does—and what I’ve been trying to say here all along.</h3>

<h3><strong>THE PROJECT </strong></h3>
<p><em>Inferna</em> is a poem-cycle by Stefene Russell, a contemporary underworld journey in miniature, told through nine cycles of three poems each and is the first installment of a planned trilogy that will mirror Dante’s <em>Divine Comedy</em>. The chapters are roughly equivalent to the circles of the underworld as described in Virgil, Dante, and the myth of the Babylonian goddess Inanna. Unlike Inanna, who loses a piece of jewelry or a piece of clothing at each gate, the speaker instead puts on magic and toxic dresses, falls into the arms of cads and criminals, and is propelled forward with keyhole glimpses of nature and the sublime. <em>Inferna</em> is not the underworld as Dante wrote it—a hell where sinners are tormented for eternity—but a subterranean ecosystem that is claustrophobic, hellishly self-referential, yet ultimately redemptive.</p>
<p> The second book, <em>Ghostboxing</em>, is inspired by Dante’s <em>Purgatorio</em>, Dadaist chance operations, and James Merrill’s supernatural epic, <em>The Changing Light at Sandover</em>. The first section will be based on fragments of EVP (electronic voice phenomenon) generated by a smartphone app near specific gravesites in Bellefontaine Cemetery. Part two is based on outtakes from the <em>“Ouija Papers”</em> of Alice Turner, who allegedly channeled the ghost of her husband, Harry Turner, St. Louis’ first real bohemian and founder of the literary magazine <em>Much Ado</em>, who drowned in the Mississippi River on Christmas Day, 1931. In part three, the <em>Possum Codex</em>, the speaker follows the nocturnal animal of the title back into the world of the living.</p>
<p> The final book in the trilogy, <em>Paysan,Voyageur</em>, is a fractal history/nature long poem set along the banks of the Mississippi, overlaying the natural history of the river with its cultural history, including the “prehistoric Manhattan” of Cahokia; the colonial French “paysans” who farmed on common fields at the edge of the river, as well as the “voyageurs,” who floated flatboats over its surface; and Chestnut Valley, the cradle of ragtime, which was demolished during St. Louis’ urban renewal program during the early ’60s. Though inspired by Dante, it locates the Paradiso not in heaven, but on a mystical and animistic earth.</p>
<p> We are asking you to help launch this trilogy by supporting this project with a purchase of one of the perks available on this campaign.</p>

<h3> “<em>Inferna</em> is a fire of transformation, the painful passage between possible states of existence, in the infinity of potential selves both imagined by the speaker and imposed by social juries and intimate adversaries. A pharmacopeia of emotional potions and poisons, a periodic table of basic elements and missing essentials for a satisfied life, it leaps gulfs of concrete knowledge and ephemeral lore in alchemy of understanding. A blinding blaze of being and a beacon of far truth, these pages burn past themselves in flashes of inspiration and scorched paths of sad wisdom.

<h3>“Stefene Russell says she belongs to the kaleidoscope school of poetry, but I think it belongs to her—nowhere in contemporary verse have I seen the newness of language, the tenacity of speaker and the vivaciousness of the imagery mixed so gellingly. Russell’s <em>Inferna</em> is a poem-cycle worth getting lost inside.”</h3>

<p>Text: Outtakes from <em>Inferna</em>, by Stefene Russell</p></div>","INTRODUCTION
 Welcome to Inferna—the richly textured, mysterious, and strangely knowable world that poet Stefene Russell inhabits so completely. In this poem-cycle’s nine sections—each with its own “tiny outfit,” idiosyncratic boyfriend, and keyhole to peer out of—Russell’s language soars and dives, and the rising and falling of so much sheer music is exhilarating. Her seemingly effortless lines are measured human breaths. They’re smart and they’re felt. Her images are well-honed blades or luxurious blankets; they startle or they comfort—depending.
 You’ll watch “the shadows / leap and fall on the walls of / the carnival tent.” You’ll hear the mockingbird (hers is an “emergency mockingbird, mind you) “singing to you, the same tune / over and over: that one / about someone stealing your car.” You’ll be a witness “as Peetie Wheatstraw’s / ghost strums / Santa Claus Blues / from a cold / blue star.”
 Inferna is absolute magic-making at its most lucid. There’s nothing abstract or unduly dreamy about this dream of a life. Russell gives us some remarkable hope: that it is indeed possible to articulate what too often threatens to remain ineffable. And she’s not shy about what she wants out of the deal: “Alleys are my city’s secret pockets. / I want the whole sky and all the wine in your house, / and all the wine in your neighbor’s house.”
 And why not? Inferna is itself so intoxicating. This is vintage Stefene Russell—and I promise there will be no easy sleeping it off. Hers is one of the most distinctive voices in this or any town. Inferna is a bad dream gone awfully good. Inferna is a flat-out wonder.
 I’m here stealing one of Russell’s lines from her opening poem on the carnival midway: “Dazzle, Dazzle, Huzzah.” That’s what this book does, and does—and what I’ve been trying to say here all along.

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>My name is Venus Mason Theus. I am a self published author and the founder of the Anointed Pen Christian Writers annual conferences.</p>

</h2>
<p>Hi there and thanks for stopping by my <em>first-ever</em> Indiegogo campaign! That video is about me, not exactly about my project. My name is Mariam, and I'm an early-career* writer/artist who has obsessed over one thing for about a year now: completing my first book.</p>
<p><em><br/><img alt=""intersections over kentucky red"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.redboneafropuff.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Intersections-of-race-etc-over-louisville-kentucky.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: left;"" title=""intersections over kentucky red""/><em>The Truth about Panties: and other revelations about Christianity, singles &amp; sex) </em></em>is the working title of my in-progress memoir about my experiences living in Southern and Midwestern red states (and about a year in a very blue state) at the intersections of Christianity, black culture, womanhood and feminism. Being a Christian adds a layer of complication to life and love for Black American women. In <em>The Truth<em>,</em></em> I<em> </em>peel back sheets of personal, spiritual and sexual discoveries as I share my search for love, purpose, godliness and acceptance in the liberal and holy worlds I don't quite belong to.</p>
<h3>The thing is ...</h3>
<p>I'm stuck. I'm not in an MFA program, and though I attend a writers group regularly, I'm at that point where I need guidance from a professional writer who will ""get it""--get the story, the intersections, the nuances of culture.</p>
<h3>That's where VONA comes in.</h3>
<p><img alt=""VONA logo"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.redboneafropuff.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/VONAlogo-2.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""VONA logo""/> </p>
<p>Voices of Our National Arts Foundation is the only <strong>multi-genre</strong> writing workshop for writers of color. (Black poets have Cave Canem, but I write memoir.) The program is for one week in Berkeley, CA, and it's a rare and wonderful opportunity for writers of color to learn from other writers of color, rather than from <a href=""http://www.redboneafropuff.com/2013/03/08/problematic-prison-panel-lessons-from-awp13/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""my blog post about these issues at AWP 13"">white teachers who often have trouble understanding the experiences of people who are not white and helping them articulate those experiences in writing.</a> My workshop leader will be Staceyann Chin, <em>Def Poetry Jam on Broadway</em> co-writer/producer, memoirist, activist, performer, etc. <strong>This is going to get me unstuck.</strong></p>
<h3>But good teaching in the arts is expensive.</h3>
<p><em>VONA costs $1450 for tuition and room and board. Airfare is NOT included.</em></p>
<h3>And I've had some setbacks over the past few years...</h3>
<ul>
<li>Layoff in 2008</li>
<li>Started a writing consultant business that never quite took off</li>
<li>4+ years without an employer or steady income</li>
<li>Still paying off undergrad loans</li>
<li>A back injury at the end of 2012 that cost about $900 in physical therapy. Didn’t put a dent in my high-deductible insurance plan. Every cent came out of my pocket.</li>
<li>A 2012 tax bill of about $2600 (which is more than my monthly net income and which I sent in right before the IRS went under criminal investigation)</li>
</ul><p>Hence, despite life being much better these days with a full-time job, I can’t pay for VONA with cash, as I want to, and I have to be realistic about debt. After all, I’m a writer.</p>
<h2>So I’m asking for help getting to VONA.</h2>
<h3>My goal is to raise $725—half the tuition/room &amp; board, from YOU.</h3>
<p>Your donations will go to my tuition/room &amp; board fees for VONA. The rest is on me. I'm willing to invest in myself as an artist and will go to VONA no matter how much or how little I raise. I will put the cost on a credit card if I have to, but generating a larger base of support will help me not be so far behind as I work for the returns on my investment.</p>
<p>Should I raise more than what I need, I’ll put the surplus towards high-quality e-publishing a series of essay collections, likely through BookBaby. The design of e-book cover, layout and distribution to all e-book platforms costs $250.</p>
<p>Should I raise more than that, I’ll put the surplus towards credit card debt incurred by paying for VONA.</p>
<h3>And you'll get something, too.</h3>
<p>Check out the perks below!</p>
<h2>Why <em>The Truth</em> and VONA are important</h2>
<p>Two reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<strong>The voices of people of color, and especially women of color, are still largely missing from the literary world.</strong> Writers of color need supportive environments in which to learn and improve their craft, just as they need opportunities for publication.</li>
<li>
<strong>Hearing these voices is important because listening can bring about social change.</strong> I believe in art as a means of achieving social change. Therefore, writing is the way I choose to engage in activism and the way I think I’m most effective as an activist. Through creative writing and performance, I want to inform readers about sexism, racism, and their resulting social injustices and inspire them to rethink their world view, change their lives and change the culture of their communities.</li>
</ol><h2>I know what you’re thinking: “Wait. She’s stuck. How do we know she can finish this book?”</h2>
<p>*I’m considered early-career because I haven’t published a book, but in Kentucky, I’m well-recognized as a writer. I’ve received awards and grants from Kentucky Foundation for Women, Kentucky Arts Council, University of Louisville, University of Kentucky and Society of Professional Journalists, Louisville Chapter.</p>
<p>And it’s not like I haven’t started. An agent read my 263-page memoir last year. It was a collection of essays then, and she suggested I rewrite it as a straight narrative. As an essayist, that has terrified me, but for the most part, I think it’s a good idea, and it’s in progress. The rewrite has already resulted in a brand new early <a href=""https://soundcloud.com/redboneafropuff/down-the-aisle"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" title=""Down the Aisle on Soundcloud"">chapter you can listen to right now</a>.</p>
<p>Also, I’ve already had people sign up for updates about this memoir, and I’ve asked close family and friends to help with this Voyage to VONA. I’m determined not to let them down, even if it means I have to do another Indiegogo campaign to raise money to self-publish my book.</p>

<h3>Darkness Strikes: A Short Story Collection</h3>
<p>Darkness Strikes is a 10,000 word-plus collection of ""dark fiction"" short stories with varying topics including murder, suicide, and battles with the afterlife. There are currently four completed stories and the book is formatted and ready to be sent to the printers, however, depending on the funds I am able to raise I will be considering an additional two stories for inclusion into the collection.<br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact and The Author</h3>
<p>My name is Timothy Daniel Farrell and I am an author from the small town of Thomaston, CT. I have been writing for a relatively short period of time, but in my short career I have really come a long way. I graduated from Thomaston High School in 2008 and am currently pursuing an associates degree in Liberal Arts and Sciences at Naugatuck Valley Community College. </p>
<p>I have held several writing jobs including freelance work for the hyper-local news website Patch.com as well as some volunteer journalism work for the video game websites HookedGamers.com and GameDwellers.com. My work is largely influenced by some of the industry giants in the ""dark fiction"" genre including Stephen King, Chuck Hogan, and Guillermo Del Toro. I also draw from M. Knight Shyamalan's style of telling a story and hitting the audience with a powerful ending.</p>
<p>This collection is my very first completed project and I am really looking forward to it's release. I have had a small number of outside participants read the finished product and the overall consensus is very positive so I have high hopes for the book's success. </p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Currently I am looking at raising close to $1,000 USD. That money will be used primarily for printing and self-publishing, but also for the purchase of an ISBN number which would allow for sales on eBook platforms like Amazon's Kindle, and for some minor marketing/promotional costs.</p>
<p>I understand that money is tight all around for everyone so if donations and pledges are too much to ask, don't worry! There are plenty of other ways to show your support! You can spread the word on various social networking sites like Twitter and Facebook, or even just by word of mouth, every little bit helps.</p>
<p>For those of you who can spare a little cash to send my way I am going to try and do as much as I can for you. I will be offering perks like free autographed copies of the book, personal shout outs through email, phone calls, or even Skype messaging, as well as personal sponsor thank you pages in the actual book!</p>
<p>If any of you have questions about me, the book, or this campaign, please don't hesitate to visit my website and send me an email. I make it a goal to answer each and every one ASAP.</p>

I graduated from Thomaston High School in 2008 and am currently pursuing an associates degree in Liberal Arts and Sciences at Naugatuck Valley Community College. 
I have held several writing jobs including freelance work for the hyper-local news website Patch.com as well as some volunteer journalism work for the video game websites HookedGamers.com and GameDwellers.com. My work is largely influenced by some of the industry giants in the ""dark fiction"" genre including Stephen King, Chuck Hogan, and Guillermo Del Toro. I also draw from M. Knight Shyamalan's style of telling a story and hitting the audience with a powerful ending.
This collection is my very first completed project and I am really looking forward to it's release. I have had a small number of outside participants read the finished product and the overall consensus is very positive so I have high hopes for the book's success. 


What We Need & What You Get
Currently I am looking at raising close to $1,000 USD. That money will be used primarily for printing and self-publishing, but also for the purchase of an ISBN number which would allow for sales on eBook platforms like Amazon's Kindle, and for some minor marketing/promotional costs.
I understand that money is tight all around for everyone so if donations and pledges are too much to ask, don't worry! There are plenty of other ways to show your support! You can spread the word on various social networking sites like Twitter and Facebook, or even just by word of mouth, every little bit helps.
For those of you who can spare a little cash to send my way I am going to try and do as much as I can for you. I will be offering perks like free autographed copies of the book, personal shout outs through email, phone calls, or even Skype messaging, as well as personal sponsor thank you pages in the actual book!
If any of you have questions about me, the book, or this campaign, please don't hesitate to visit my website and send me an email. I make it a goal to answer each and every one ASAP.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

Te Karehu had managed to scramble out of the turnip garden and fought to keep ahead of her pursuers; however, she was only a young girl and the men quickly caught her before she could reach the cover of the surrounding scrub.

<p><strong><em>Project </em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Born for War: New Zealand’s Military History – A Family Perspective</em></strong> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>An historical novel and accompanying documentary, with a difference. Born for War begins with traditional Maori inter-tribal warfare in the far-north of Aotearoa (New Zealand) in 1800 (see excerpt above); before continuing on through a number of subsequent conflicts and events, over a period of approximately 200 years. It focuses upon a number of ‘real’ characters (all related), including Maori war chiefs, European war heroes and their descendants; their roles and actions in their respective conflicts (including their interactions with each other). As well as being an entertaining novel, it can also be utilised as an academic reference; as the characters and events have been researched comprehensively and the novel referenced as such. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong><em>Aim of this project</em></strong></p>
<p>This novel is not meant to promote or legitimise war in any way, shape or form - it is simply an honest account to acknowledge the roles and actions of 'real' characters during these conflicts. The novel takes a real 'twist' toward the end, with the author questioning the value of conflict as a way of resolving problems. The only genuine conclusion that can be drawn, is that war is a futile exercise.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>'War does not determine who is right and who is wrong - only who is left'.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong><em>Author </em></strong></p>
<p>The author is ex-military himself, having served in the Australian Army for a period of 10 years (1995-2005); initially as a Para-trooper with 3 RAR, before corps transferring and becoming a Military Policeman with 2 MP Coy. During his military career, he was presented with the awards for 'Most Outstanding Soldier' and 'Best at P.T.' (Physical Training) whilst at the School of Infantry in 1996; the 'Student of Merit' at the ADF Dental School in 1999; and 'Provost Marshal Army - Certificate of Merit' for fighting fires and evacuating personnel during 2002. The author was deployed on Operation Relex II in 2003, and was promoted to Corporal later that year. The author represented NSW Army in Rugby Union (1996) and Basketball (2003 &amp; 2004). After discharging from the defence forces, the author completed a Bachelor of Arts degree (2005-2007) and a Master of Teaching degree (2008-2009); he now teaches in the South West Sydney region.</p>
 
<p><strong><em>Impact of the 'Born for War' project so far</em></strong></p>
<p>The author's research has already had an impact upon New Zealand's cultural, historical and legal scenes. A discovery about the signatories to the Treaty of Waitangi, has been discussed by academics, scholars and historians and is currently being used in the current Ngapuhi Treaty Hearings. The author's research is being used by the Ministry for Culture and Heritage on their New Zealand History online website. Two Kiwi artists, Penny Howard (painter) and Doug Poole (poet); have created artworks and poems about Ngapuhi chief Moka Te Kainga-mataa, using my research findings as their inspiration. The Russell Museum is displaying an exhibition titled 'Three Brother Chiefs: Te Wharerahi, Rewa, Moka' in 2012.*Please refer to the website addresses below for further information.</p>
 
<p><strong><em>What I will spend your hard-earned money on</em></strong></p>
<p>As part of my research process, I have endeavoured to travel to as many of the sites of which I write. I have done this for a number of reasons. The first reason being, to 'walk the ground' so that I can undertake a thorough ground appreciation, as well as observe any specific aspects which can assist my writing. Another reason being, to pay my respects to every soldier of whom I write.</p>
 
<p>I plan to travel to, and undertake research on the former WW1 Western Front of Ypres (Ieper) and Messines (Mesen) in Belgium, in June 2011. This trip will see me visit numerous battle sites, museums, memorials, and cemeteries in this region. Of particular note, is my visit to the Kandahar Farm Cemetery in Wulverghem, to pay my respects to a family member, who lost his life on the first day of the Battle of Messines on June 7, 1917.*Hence the specific date of my trip.</p>
 
<p><strong><em>Why I need your help</em></strong></p>
<p>I have already purchased the airfare and travel insurance ($1,900) but still require 'on-site' costs i.e. regional travel (trains), local travel (buses, taxi), accommodation, food, entry fees, etc.</p>
 
<p>I have invested upwards of $40,000 of my own funds towards this project, without any funding from organisations or institutions (with the exception of the Neville Wallace Children's and Grandchildren's Memorial Trust, who provided $500 towards my Vietnamese research trip in 2010). As you can imagine, these research trips are extremely costly, and when added together - are a considerable challenge for a writer without any funding.</p>

<p>Somos un grupo de jóvenes indígenas nahuas y popolucas que vivimos en el Sur de Veracruz en México, integrados a la  “Articulación de la Sierra de Santa Marta” donde compartimos sueños, sembramos y cultivamos semillas de un futuro mejor para nuestros pueblos.  Enlazamos nuestro trabajo el Movimiento de resistencia civil contra las altas tarifas de luz, la Red de mujeres de la tierra unidas por un futuro y un mundo mejor, nuestras radios comunitarias, el Centro de Derechos Humanos de los pueblos del Sur de Veracruz “Bety Cariño”, el proceso de “Fortalecimiento de los pueblos popolucas en defensa del territorio” y el Colectivo Altepee.</p>
<p><strong>QUE ESTAMOS HACIENDO, COMO PUEDES AYUDAR</strong></p>
<p>Estamos construyendo nuestro centro de articulación, una palapa comunitaria, con el esfuerzo en ayuda mutua de todos y todas.

<h2><strong>FOR THE CONSTRUCTION OF OUR AUTONOMOUS, INDIGENOUS COMMUNITY RADIO, MEXICO</strong></h2>
<p><strong>WHO WE ARE</strong></p>
<p>We are a group of indigenous youth, nahuas and popolucas, who live in southern Veracruz in Mexico, part of an organizing process called the “Articulation of the Sierra Santa Marta Region,” where we share dreams and cultivate seeds of a better future for our communities.  We bring together our diverse forms of work and organizing, the Civil Resistance Movement Against High Electricity Rates, the Network of Women United for a Better Future and World, our Community Radios, the Bety Cariño Center for Human Rights of the Peoples of Southern Veracruz, the Strengthening the Popoluca People in Defense of the Land,” and the Colectivo Altepee. </p>
<p><strong>WHAT WE’RE DOING, HOW YOU CAN HELP</strong></p>
<p>We are building a community center, our palapa, a joint space of articulation, with the mutual help of everyone – men and women, youth, adults, and elders.  This year, 2013, we plan to build a room for editing audio and video, and a radio booth for the community radio station.  It is for this construction project that we are fundraising six thousand dollars.</p>
<p>In the case that you can’t contribute monetarily, but you wish to help, please circulate the information of our efforts to your contacts! </p>
<p><strong>IMPACT</strong></p>
<p>With the construction of our radio booth at our articulation center, where our our communities come together, and where our small store sells local products, we will liven up our community radio station – producing videos and audio here at our community <em>palapa</em> – strengthening  our presence and the quality of programming for our communities.</p>

<p>""Drink tea ‘til you pee"". This may be <em>the </em>most important secret for succeeding in business in Afghanistan and the rest of the developing world. Of course, it’s not really about the tea. So what <em>is </em>the principle embedded in that phrase that so often dictates the success or failure of a business deal in most of the world? It is this principle, and others like it, that this book will spell out. </p>
<p>This book uses my business experiences in Afghanistan to illustrate what it takes to succeed in business in environments outside of the West and how to successfully manage cross-culturally. This is not a book about the war in Afghanistan, though it certainly deals with its consequences.</p>
<p>I landed in Afghanistan in 2003 as one of a small group of eight senior executives for a new mobile phone start-up - now Afghanistan's largest mobile phone provider. Pock-marked skeletal buildings showed the physical damage wrought on the country by its over two decades of nearly continuous conflict. But I quickly discovered that the cost in human capital was far greater as I began to work with Afghans whose approach to business and to life had been shaped principally by their need to simply survive. To navigate this hostile minefield of cultural complexities required every bit of the cultural intelligence and experience that I had learned through my childhood growing up in Ecuador and Indonesia and my years doing business in over thirty countries around the world. </p>
<p>Over the years spent working in Afghanistan, I have gathered together stories of my experiences - some are funny, others serious and still others life-threatening. Many of these experiences illustrate key principles for how to lead, manage and do business cross-culturally. After leaving the mobile phone company I started my own leadership training company where my colleagues and I trained and mentored senior Afghan leaders in business and government. It was here that I honed and applied the principles which I had learned through sweat, tears and (almost) blood. </p>
<p>This book targets the business professional who is or will be working cross-culturally. However, with the size of the world shrinking quickly, most of us, even outside the business realm, are dealing with relationships that cross the cultural divide. This book is for you too.</p>
<h3><strong>So, how can you help?</strong></h3>
<p>I need your financial support to finish this book and get it published. Indiegogo gives you an easy way to join me on this journey.</p>
<h3><strong>How does Indiegogo work?</strong></h3>
<p>Indiegogo works by helping me fund my project online through your contributions. You contribute, but you also get a reward for your contribution and for partnering with me. </p>
<p>I have tried to make the rewards mostly about getting a copy of the book itself, but wanted to throw in an extra here and there to say thanks to everyone who has faith in me. I've put in one ultimate (and crazy) reward for those who are crazy like me (and have deep pockets); a business tour of Kabul and, naturally, a round of golf at the world’s most dangerous golf course, the Kabul Golf Club… and a book, of course. After arriving in Kabul, I'll be your own personal guide and golf buddy at the course that was still a live minefield when I first arrived in the country in 2002. Don't worry. They've all been cleared... they say.</p>
<h3><strong>What’s the process for contributing? </strong></h3>
<p>    • Click on the Contribute button</p>
<p>    • Contribute $15 or more. You can use your credit card or Paypal account.</p>
<p>    • Tell others about the book and encourage them to join the adventure! <strong> </strong></p>
<h3><strong>Reaching the Goal</strong></h3>
<p>There is no upper limit to the support the project can receive. The more money it receives, the higher quality the editing, the higher quality the graphics art and the higher quality the book itself. Ultimately I’d love to market the book more widely, but that really is a stretch goal!</p>
<h3><strong>Where the Money goes </strong></h3>
<p>    • A good editor… used multiple times! <br/>     • Professional advice <br/>     • Cover graphics that speak of quality <br/>     • Printing costs <br/>     • Expenses related to the actual writing</p>
<p>If you think a friend would like to be part of this effort, please tell them about this book and send them to my Indiegogo page (<a href=""http://www.indiegogo.com/CurtLaird"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.indiegogo.com/CurtLaird</a>). I’m very grateful for the support. </p>
<p>Will you partner with me? The journey you will enter into with me goes beyond this book. My hope is that I can build a band of journeymates who will travel with me either in reality or vicariously as we journey across the globe and across cultures. Thank you!</p>
<div>
<h3><strong>Risks and Challenges</strong></h3>
<p>Challenges: Staying alive at least until the book gets published! Just kidding… sort of. My wife, Katrina (who I met in Kabul), and I will head back into Kabul after the Christmas season in Seattle. As long as we have no more crazies like Terry Jones burning Qurans and no one tells the Taliban that I'm going to mention them in the book, we’ll be fine.</p>
<p>I'll finish up the writing using the editorial services of a quality self-publishing house, get my Afghan colleagues' final input and then send it to be printed. Of course Afghanistan tends to alter most well-laid plans, but adaptability is one of the principles from the book and that principle will be well-used by the end of the project.</p>

<p><strong>EMPOWERED2BEME</strong><br/>Hi, and thank you for your interest.  <em>Empowered2beme (My Cure for Type 2 Diabetes) </em>is a very robust book and manual to help others overcomeType2 Diabetes and is the culmination of countless hours of personal research and development that empowered me to overcome Type 2 Diabetes and morbid obesity.  This is not information given by my doctor or dietician.  This is a lifestyle change, not a diet and is simple and easy to follow.</p>
<p><strong>Type 2 Diabetes ""The Silent Killer""</strong><br/>Type 2 Diabetes is one of the worlds largest and fastest growing epidemics, currently with more than  24,000,000,000 diagnosed in the U.S. alone without prejudice.   346 million people worldwide have diabetes.  Diabetes is a leading cause in Heart Attacks and Strokes and is the perpetrator and cause of countless deaths.  The information I have put together if followed could possibly eradicate the death rate from Type 2 Diabetes.<br/><br/><strong>The Cure</strong><br/>Have your ever lost a loved one or dear friend to a serious illness or disease and it seemed there was nothing you could do to help.  NOW is the time!  I believe this book contains the power to eradicate Type 2 Diabetes.  What a bold statement, I know!  But after more than 15 years of uncontrolled sugar levels between 300 and 600 at any given time, I am FREE and have been for more than three years.  (and I am not on any medicine to regulate my blood sugar levels).</p>
<p><strong>The Question</strong><br/>If you had the cure would you wait, would you stay silent, would help get the cure to others?  Or would you do nothing?  I believe I found the cure and can't stay silent.</p>
<p><strong>The Plea </strong><br/>I need your help to make this possible.  Help me ""Rock the world with hope"".</p>
<p><strong>The Book</strong><br/>The book will be separated for quick reference, the first part being the story of how I personally overcame Type 2 Diabetes and subsequent chapters of detailed access to food lists and nutritional information and guides showing others how each food will effect their blood sugar levels and showing them how to make the best choices.  <br/><br/>Our food producers and Associations are deceiving the vast population diagnosed with Type2 Diabetes by labeling food as ""Sugar Free"" it may be sugar free; however a lot of these sugar free foods are worse for you to eat than normal sweets.  Its a LIE and the results are that of a insulin nuclear bomb!  This book will educate and Empower those diagnosed with Type2 Diabetes on the truths about foods and how they truly effect the body.   I am very passionate about this because these principles and this information has changed and saved my life and halted further complications.  <br/><br/><strong>The Recipe Book</strong><br/>The Recipe Book will offer recipes that I have personally created and others that have been adapted to allow people with Type2 Diabetes to enjoy life with freedoms to include Entrees, Appetizers and Desserts that should not elevate the blood sugar levels.  <br/><br/><strong>The App</strong><br/>The App will give quick access to foods with needed values and offer a quick list of best choices for foods that should not elevate the blood sugar levels.  The App will also allow each person to track their daily, weekly and monthly progress.</p>
<p><strong>The Website</strong><br/>The website will integrate cooking videos, pod casts, blogs as support forums and links to helpful information, calendar of events and special offers such as an e-format of the book and recipe book that will offer the same integration to track progress as the app does.  </p>
<p><strong>My Brief Story</strong><br/>For 15 years i struggled with uncontrolled Type2 Diabetes with little problems/symptoms except for frequent urination, which was not so bad; however, my blood sugar at anytime would range between 300-600.  I was not compliant with the doctors orders because the medicine they prescribed made me sick and it was worse than the current symptoms.</p>
<p> About 5 years ago i began to experience Diabetic Neuropathy and was eventually diagnosed with Diabetic Retinopathy.  I took this serious and did not want to lose my vision or legs.  The doctors prescribed medicine and I was compliant to take it, but did not want to be on it for the rest of my life like the doctor said, so I started researching what caused Type2 Diabetes and found it was pretty much in direct relation to what you eat.  For the past almost four years my blood sugar has remained in normal range (usually lower than those that have never had blood sugar problems and my last A1C was 5.1 which is incredible) and the neuropathy and retinopathy has subsided.  I want to share what I discovered with the world to help everyone that struggles with Type 2 Diabetes overcome.  Help me ""Rock the world with Hope!"".</p>

<span><br/>The more we discussed it, the more controversy, double standards and ""unspoken rules"" kept coming up.  It was astonishing how people's lives are controlled by rules they often do not even realize are there.

<h1>The Impact:</h1>Reading this far, it's likely you either really
support the idea of women being able to express themselves this way –
or you're totally against it.<br/><br/><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: bold;"">Our question to you is:  can you
clearly answer why?</p>
<br/><font>We are creating a book that
attracts interest due to its controversy - and then challenges people
to really think about who they are, and what they want out of life. 
Possibly even becoming aware of beliefs they never realized they had,
but just  ""accepted"".</font>
<span>We are not trying to tell you what to think. We are asking you to think - and share with others what you think. The theme of this book, addresses one of the fundamental aspects of being an adult woman. Though fundamental, it is often shrouded in a multitude of cultural rules for expression. <br/><br/>It appears some of the challenges in cultures stem from people not feeling comfortable talking about certain topics – resulting in those areas becoming “covert”. This not only hinders freedom of expression but also causes internal conflicts. It also opens the door for exploitation.<br/><br/>Perhaps by really thinking about this topic, and considering both your spoken and unspoken rules, you might expand that to other areas as well. Are you truly living the life you want to and being the person your really are inside? Are you living up to your true potential? If not, what is really holding you back?<br/><br/>By sending these books to influential people, and the resulting controversy, our goal is to encourage people worldwide to think about what it means to be a woman, and feel more comfortable being whoever they are.<br/><br/>Since it has no nudity or profanity, it should be allowable in most venues.<br/><br/>By these women sharing their personal dreams, hopes and fears, maybe people will realize that we're all unique, but deep down, not all that different.  We believe the better we understand and appreciate each other, the richer life is.</span><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Our way of doing this is to capture a snapshot of these ladies lives - expressing their emotion and simply being in the moment.</span><br/><br/><p style=""font-weight: bold;""><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Billy Cone once said that to him, art is anything that both moved the artist, and conveys emotion in those seeing it.  After you see this book, we think you'll agree that these wonderful women are very real people, who have become ""ART"". </span><br/></p>

What does it mean to be a woman today?  
Do women really have the right to fully express, and be themselves?  Does society still hold women back?  If so, how does society hold women back? Who holds women back?   This book and social network address these questions in a new way.  It will intrigue, shock, and possibly disturb you.  As a result, you might just think about things in a different way.  It is a controversial series of women's interviews and photos. There is no nudity, just astonishing portraits of women from all walks-of-life.However, most of the women also had portraits taken while having intense orgasms.  
Some chose not to, it was completely voluntary.  
Why did they do this?  To make a statement, to stimulate discussion about women's rights, to express themselves, to be part of something that challenges social stigmas and norms, and to have beautiful portraits made. They also participated because there is a revolutionary device that allows women to achieve the big ""O""- quickly and while fully clothed.
They talked about their feelings of double standards on many topics, including careers, academics, ""acceptable behavior"", taking the initiative in relationships, sexual expression, masturbation, bi and homosexuality, chivalry, the future, being the ""bread winner"", children, and other topics.We found a common reason why women felt they couldn't express 
themselves.
It wasn't what we expected.We didn't start out asking these questions - a very unusual path led us here.  Sometimes life is much stranger than fiction.Human Innovations is a health and biotechnology start-up. The director of R&D was researching ways to help with scarring and adhesions that can result
from C-Section surgery.  He discovered a method, and device, that appeared to
help significantly.The device also caused an unexpected side effect.  It literally gave the fully clothed women who
tested it intense orgasms.  While this was quite amazing, it certainly was not part of their original direction.

All the women emphatically endorsed it 
for private, home use.  

However, a new controversy arose.



One woman suggested that since you can
be fully clothed, why not have it in health clubs, and even dance
clubs? The DiscoStick(TM) worked through clothing, even jeans - so why not?
Many women agreed, others were horrified... 

How would you react? How would your family and friends react?

Just because something was possible, should we do it?

Things got even more confusing when some women said it absolutely was not acceptable in general.  However, it might be OK in certain exceptions, like at a Chippendale's show and other women were doing it, or if their partner, or boy friend “made” them try it at a dance club.  What is the difference?  When women talked about it together, they often were not able to explain why they had their particular view. Frequently, their answer was ""that's just the way it is"".Granted this is a very new and different scenario, but it forced us to address many questions most people did not know, nor did not want to even acknowledge existed.  A huge variety of responses continued to come from different women and their partners. This also caused other questions to come up about what exactly it meant to be a woman today. Do women have equal rights with men? A similar
situation happened with drugs like Viagra®*
a prescription only “medical” therapy for men. 
How
is this different?
Are women truly “sexually liberated” today – or are there still hidden rules that rigidly dictate how women express themselves? What other “unwritten and unspoken” rules are out there?

Are these rules truly helping women (and men) be all they can be? Who enforces these rules?  Do Men, Women, both parties enforce these rules?

Please see our Perks on the upper right side of the site.  We are only offering what we can currently provide - with your help, together we can really make a difference!Please also note that the ""Limited Collectors Edition"" Ebooks will include more photos than the printed versions, as well as the Ebooks which will be available later.  Further, you can send a request to the Author regarding who you'd like the book dedicated to, as well as other thoughts.  Steve will write a personal note in response & sign it.  We'll then scan the message and integrate it into your personal collectors edition Ebook.If you use a coupon to purchase printed books at our wholesale cost + shipping, Steve will write a personal note and dedication on this inside of each book for you.For digital images, we will provide you a login & password to an online photo gallery.  After browsing the gallery & selecting the image(s) you like, just let us know their name(s).  We'll then email or provide a link to the high resolution file.  Digital images offered are in the 8-18 mega pixel size & suitable for very large prints.  If you want to print the portrait, we can also give recommendations to the highest quality & most cost effective photo printers we have found so far.  To make sure we can deliver on everything we have here, we're only providing the digital media, however the printers we refer you to will charge you the same wholesale cost we would have paid.
We'd like to meet you!  Alie, Delilah, Maude, Billy, EJ, Steve and all the others participating in the book are members of the social networking site.  You can create an account and ask any of them questions. 
If you think of something else you'd like, contact us & make an offer!  It's possible we can add it as a Perk!




What do we do if the funding is over $20k?
First, we all dance a jig!  Then - more books!!!!  More funding allows us to print more books. You funding the project makes this happen.

Also, getting the books to physically exist is just step one. Getting
 people to think is the next big challenge.
With sufficient funding we'll send hundreds of copies of the hard copy book to influential people & hopefully challenge them to think.  We'll send (or hand 
deliver) them to  Lady Gaga, public libraries, Donald Trump, Ellen Degeneres, Rush Libaugh, Snoop Dog, David Guetta, Oprah,  Michelle & Barack Obama, Oprah, Grahm Norton, Sarah Palin, Hillary Clinton, Bill Clinton, Martha Steward, Queen Elizabeth, The Daily Show, The Colbert Report, & Hugh Hefner to name a few.

</div><div></div>
<p>From the Sirhan Sirhan (RFK’s killer) event, Mark
David Chapman (John Lennon’s killer) to the more recent MKULTRA Sleeper Patsy James Homes (Aurora, CO theatre shooting) event, many have suspected
mind-control being employed for “plausibly deniable” government agency assassinations,
and “false flag” terror events.  These
clandestine operations mislead, and terrorize the public to serve the
interests of an elite group within the security-political establishment.</p>
<p>To execute these covert crimes, mind-control R &amp; D
is needed.  In 1940 the OSS (CIA
precursor), and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) started a
joint-project to develop “better assassins.” This announcement was published in The Ottawa Citizen in 1940.  Canada provides the Guinea Pig subjects for US military/CIA experiments
to refine mind-control, with RCMP assistance. 
Matthew Pauly has been a non-consensual MKULTRA Sleeper Assassin test
subject (and non-consenting fatal weapons tester) since Nov 2005 when he was coerced into a Canadian Military 5-ton,
armored van (plate 250002) and used as the subject for a joint-training exercise between the US
JTF, and Canadian JTF2, with RCMP support. 
</p>
<p>There have been nearly a dozen torturous events Matthew has been subject of, including being forced to
assassinate after being sworn as an enemy of the US, abducted onto US soil, high-dosed with Scopolamine (#1
mind control drug), tortured until dissociated, hypnotized, and finally coerced
at gunpoint.  </p><p>Matthew finally shook off his US Consulate based, JTF handler in July, 2015 by publicly (on Facebook) calling
in the Israeli Institute for Special Operations and Intelligence after “Mitch” had asked all about his Jewish friends, including
their occupations, addresses, and names during his intended last contact during
a May, 2015 home invasion, before an intended fatal weapons test on June 4, 2015 in
Toronto.  Mitch had previously reported
being tortured, and mind-controlled by his Nazi grandfather since he was five. His grandfather he reported was a mind-control scientist brought to American in the CIA’s ‘Project Paperclip’
in 1945.</p>
<p>Through one tradecraft error by Mitch on
June 4, 2015 Matthew detected danger and survived his second fatal weapons test.  It remains to be seen if Matthew survives the
Israeli Institute for Special Operations and Intelligence reaction to his very public whistleblowing to the government of Israel,
several Israeli newspapers, and their American and Canadian counterparts. </p><p></p><p>He had whistle blown of the Israeli Institute for Special Operations and Intelligence’s death threat delivered in person July 14, 2015 at his house regarding a faked, hate, snuff film that Mitch (JTF) produced for the very purpose of leaking it to this agency to trick them into murdering Matthew, his test-subject become whistleblower.  Since Matthew had amnesia due to torture-dissociation, they wished him to first remember the faked, hate, snuff film before they came back and murdered him; the film was well done and does not look fake</p><p>The Israeli Institute for Special Operations and Intelligence forcibly injected him with a radio nuclei on Aug 3, 2015. This ""smart assassination"" murder technique results in a 'plausibly deniable' death due to multiple-organ Cancer that starts about one year after the injection(s).</p><p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">For ten years Matthew has been writing a
book manuscript detailing his non-consensual involvement in this program.  He recently teamed up with a fellow MKULTRA
survivor Ann Diamond who wrote several books about her surviving childhood
experiments by Dr. Ewen Cameron at the Allan Memorial Institute in Montreal, a
CIA funded MKULTRA operation.  All that
remains is minor effort to revise and edit the manuscript.  This proposal is to seek the funding to complete the book, and especially to provide for extra security.</span><br/></p>
Matthew has been a computer programmer for
twenty-five years, but has been unable to work for the past 2.5 years due to
significant PTSD illness from the many violent events at the hands of Mitch the
US JTF officer.  Please see Matthew’s
recent interview with Sean Stone on “The Buzzsaw”, see above link.<div> <div>If you wish a far more detailed account about the book, please see the prior fundraiser <a href=""https://www.indiegogo.com/campaigns/the-murder-of-time-making-and-unmasking-a-sleeper#/story"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">The Murder of Time: Making and Unmasking a Sleeper</a>

several Israeli newspapers, and their American and Canadian counterparts. He had whistle blown of the Israeli Institute for Special Operations and Intelligence’s death threat delivered in person July 14, 2015 at his house regarding a faked, hate, snuff film that Mitch (JTF) produced for the very purpose of leaking it to this agency to trick them into murdering Matthew, his test-subject become whistleblower.  Since Matthew had amnesia due to torture-dissociation, they wished him to first remember the faked, hate, snuff film before they came back and murdered him; the film was well done and does not look fakeThe Israeli Institute for Special Operations and Intelligence forcibly injected him with a radio nuclei on Aug 3, 2015. This ""smart assassination"" murder technique results in a 'plausibly deniable' death due to multiple-organ Cancer that starts about one year after the injection(s).For ten years Matthew has been writing a
book manuscript detailing his non-consensual involvement in this program.  He recently teamed up with a fellow MKULTRA
survivor Ann Diamond who wrote several books about her surviving childhood
experiments by Dr. Ewen Cameron at the Allan Memorial Institute in Montreal, a
CIA funded MKULTRA operation.  All that
remains is minor effort to revise and edit the manuscript.  This proposal is to seek the funding to complete the book, and especially to provide for extra security.
Matthew has been a computer programmer for
twenty-five years, but has been unable to work for the past 2.5 years due to
significant PTSD illness from the many violent events at the hands of Mitch the
US JTF officer.  Please see Matthew’s
recent interview with Sean Stone on “The Buzzsaw”, see above link. If you wish a far more detailed account about the book, please see the prior fundraiser The Murder of Time: Making and Unmasking a Sleeper

<h3>The Tao of Bob</h3>
<p>I'm Spike Gillespie, writer, teacher, secular officiant. In 2015 through a series of remarkable and rather unbelievable events, I came into possession of <a href=""http://www.TinyTRanch.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">a little ranch</a> just east of Austin, the city where I'd lived for 24 years. The ranch was rundown, rumored to have been a meth lab, and featured an informal junkyard. Through incredible support from investors, friends, and strangers, I gutted and remodeled the house and barn and purchased a 250 square-foot tiny chapel. This never finished project, known as the Tiny T Ranch, is now home to weddings, memorial services, gatherings for grieving parents, workshops, classes, and retreats. It is also <strong>Home to Bob</strong>.</p>
<p>Bob came on my radar in late 2016. His daughter, Ellen, is a great friend of mine. When her mom/Bob's wife died that summer, Bob-- who'd spent nearly nine decades as a Midwest farmer-- decided it was time for a change. He wanted to winter closer to Ellen in Austin, but he hoped for a rural setting, not being a big fan of cities. When I heard his desire, I invited him to come stay with me. Aside from having my son, this was THE BEST CHOICE I EVER MADE.</p>
<p>It didn't take long for us to realize how much we love each other. One day when I was reminding Bob this was his home, that he wasn't a visitor, he admitted he really would like to live out his days here. And so it came to pass. He flew to Indiana in the spring of 2017 and, with the help of one of his sons, he drove the rest of his stuff down. We are officially in it for life.</p>
<p>It's time for me to tell the story of Bob and our life at the ranch. This is more than a real-life buddy film unfolding on a daily basis. As many of you know from my previous books, I have struggled with PTSD, anxiety, and depression much of my life, ailments that are directly related to having been raised by a mentally ill father. I have dedicated much of my adult life to seeking help to heal from the extensive fallout of this trauma. <a href=""http://www.MeditationKicksAss.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Meditation</a>, therapy, friends, exercise, writing-- all of this has helped. But nothing has helped more than having Bob around. He is my new father, a gentle man who reassures and loves me daily, who has helped me through heartbreak, lawnmower crises, frozen pipes, and the aggravation of the occasional shitty client. Bob understands the long view and patiently reminds me about impermanence and looking forward instead of back. He is a Living Buddha.</p>
<p>It's also the story of jumping in and making space for radical change. Sometimes Bob and I sit around just laughing about our circumstances. Did I ever think I'd be living with an old farmer from Indiana? Hell No. Did he ever imagine living with a tattooed aging punk rocker who hosts same-sex marriages, Vampire LARP parties, and has a penchant for adopting rescue dogs and horses? Again: Hell No. Other times we talk about the extreme stress both of us were under not long before we met. Each of us spent much of 2016 caring for gravely ill partners and feeling nearly broken in the process. We're helping each other heal from that stress, too, including encouraging each other to eat-- between us we unintentionally lost 75 pounds thanks to our respective ordeals. These days we eat tomato sandwiches the way our horses eat grass.</p>
<p>As with my last two books, the plan is to self-publish this one. Your contribution will help me buy the necessary time to carve out the space I need to dedicate myself to writing. Those of you who know me know I am a workhorse, which is a good thing considering the constant and never ending demands of running Tiny T. The funds I am seeking will serve as a sort of book advance so that I can step away from some of my off-ranch work for a couple of months and dedicate myself to this project. </p>
<p>I'm aiming for a $7,000 goal, some of which will afford me writing time and the balance of which will cover printing costs. Perks include a chance to pre-purchase the book, some badass merch, and Lunch With Bob.</p>
<p>As with many of <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss_2?url=search-alias%3Daps&amp;field-keywords=spike+gillespie"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">my past books</a>, this one will be a hybrid: part memoir and part self-help. I want to share the story of Bob so you can feel the love, too. Hopefully you'll also be inspired if you, too, are struggling with the ongoing challenges of mental illness.</p>
<p>I have a good track record with these projects. This will be my third self-published book and I am very familiar with what it takes to go from writing the first word to mailing off finished books. I'm a professional writer with eight previous titles published. In 2016 I was voted <a href=""https://www.austinchronicle.com/best-of-austin/year:2016/poll:readers/category:arts-and-entertainment/spike-gillespie-best-nonfiction-writer-memoirist/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Best Nonfiction/Memoirist Writer in Austin in the Austin Chronicle's Annual Best Of Austin Issue</a> (an award I also received in 2006).</p>
<p>Risks and challenges are minimal, but they exist. Typically I write pretty fast given that my other work is demanding so I don't have time to sit in a field by a pond and dreamily contemplate the process. That said, this time around I am giving myself eight months to complete this project-- luxuriously long by my standards. So it's not really a risk, just a note that if you do contribute, books won't be delivered until 2018. There is also a very slim chance that I might choose to shop this one to some big houses. While I have been published in the past by Simon &amp; Schuster, The University of Texas Press, and Seal Press, honestly self-publishing best suits my punk rock DIY style. However should I decide to send it out to a few agents, and should someone show interest, there is the possibility that publication might take a little longer since traditional houses are notoriously slow to get books out there.</p>

</div><div><h3> </h3></div><div><h3> </h3></div><div><h3> </h3></div></div>","The Tao of Bob
I'm Spike Gillespie, writer, teacher, secular officiant. In 2015 through a series of remarkable and rather unbelievable events, I came into possession of a little ranch just east of Austin, the city where I'd lived for 24 years. The ranch was rundown, rumored to have been a meth lab, and featured an informal junkyard. Through incredible support from investors, friends, and strangers, I gutted and remodeled the house and barn and purchased a 250 square-foot tiny chapel. This never finished project, known as the Tiny T Ranch, is now home to weddings, memorial services, gatherings for grieving parents, workshops, classes, and retreats. It is also Home to Bob.
Bob came on my radar in late 2016. His daughter, Ellen, is a great friend of mine. When her mom/Bob's wife died that summer, Bob-- who'd spent nearly nine decades as a Midwest farmer-- decided it was time for a change. He wanted to winter closer to Ellen in Austin, but he hoped for a rural setting, not being a big fan of cities. When I heard his desire, I invited him to come stay with me. Aside from having my son, this was THE BEST CHOICE I EVER MADE.
It didn't take long for us to realize how much we love each other. One day when I was reminding Bob this was his home, that he wasn't a visitor, he admitted he really would like to live out his days here. And so it came to pass. He flew to Indiana in the spring of 2017 and, with the help of one of his sons, he drove the rest of his stuff down. We are officially in it for life.
It's time for me to tell the story of Bob and our life at the ranch. This is more than a real-life buddy film unfolding on a daily basis. As many of you know from my previous books, I have struggled with PTSD, anxiety, and depression much of my life, ailments that are directly related to having been raised by a mentally ill father. I have dedicated much of my adult life to seeking help to heal from the extensive fallout of this trauma. Meditation, therapy, friends, exercise, writing-- all of this has helped. But nothing has helped more than having Bob around. He is my new father, a gentle man who reassures and loves me daily, who has helped me through heartbreak, lawnmower crises, frozen pipes, and the aggravation of the occasional shitty client. Bob understands the long view and patiently reminds me about impermanence and looking forward instead of back. He is a Living Buddha.
It's also the story of jumping in and making space for radical change. Sometimes Bob and I sit around just laughing about our circumstances. Did I ever think I'd be living with an old farmer from Indiana? Hell No. Did he ever imagine living with a tattooed aging punk rocker who hosts same-sex marriages, Vampire LARP parties, and has a penchant for adopting rescue dogs and horses? Again: Hell No. Other times we talk about the extreme stress both of us were under not long before we met. Each of us spent much of 2016 caring for gravely ill partners and feeling nearly broken in the process. We're helping each other heal from that stress, too, including encouraging each other to eat-- between us we unintentionally lost 75 pounds thanks to our respective ordeals. These days we eat tomato sandwiches the way our horses eat grass.
As with my last two books, the plan is to self-publish this one. Your contribution will help me buy the necessary time to carve out the space I need to dedicate myself to writing. Those of you who know me know I am a workhorse, which is a good thing considering the constant and never ending demands of running Tiny T. The funds I am seeking will serve as a sort of book advance so that I can step away from some of my off-ranch work for a couple of months and dedicate myself to this project. 
I'm aiming for a $7,000 goal, some of which will afford me writing time and the balance of which will cover printing costs. Perks include a chance to pre-purchase the book, some badass merch, and Lunch With Bob.
As with many of my past books, this one will be a hybrid: part memoir and part self-help. I want to share the story of Bob so you can feel the love, too. Hopefully you'll also be inspired if you, too, are struggling with the ongoing challenges of mental illness.
I have a good track record with these projects. This will be my third self-published book and I am very familiar with what it takes to go from writing the first word to mailing off finished books. I'm a professional writer with eight previous titles published. In 2016 I was voted Best Nonfiction/Memoirist Writer in Austin in the Austin Chronicle's Annual Best Of Austin Issue (an award I also received in 2006).
Risks and challenges are minimal, but they exist. Typically I write pretty fast given that my other work is demanding so I don't have time to sit in a field by a pond and dreamily contemplate the process. That said, this time around I am giving myself eight months to complete this project-- luxuriously long by my standards. So it's not really a risk, just a note that if you do contribute, books won't be delivered until 2018. There is also a very slim chance that I might choose to shop this one to some big houses. While I have been published in the past by Simon & Schuster, The University of Texas Press, and Seal Press, honestly self-publishing best suits my punk rock DIY style. However should I decide to send it out to a few agents, and should someone show interest, there is the possibility that publication might take a little longer since traditional houses are notoriously slow to get books out there.
I know not everyone will be in the position to help financially. Every time I ask for help I feel a little reluctant because I know there are so many people and organizations also seeking help, that a lot of these folks have truly desperate needs, and that also, in these trying times you might be more inclined to spend your money on non-profits or, you know, food and electricity. Even if you can't help with a financial contribution, I would be so grateful if you'd help me spread the word. 
Thank you so much.

<p>I am not doing the work that I feel called to do.  In essence I feel called to evangelize, but not in the traditional way people think about.  I am not an extrovert and although I have faith in the Holy Spirit I am rarely able to let the flames of my faith burn brightly when there's a large number of people.  God seems to be directing me away from teaching so what am I supposed to do?  What risk do I need to take to work for the greater glory of God before my life on earth ends?  Life can be very short and even if I make it to 100 years old I'm willing to bet that I will still think it was too short.  I need to do something <i>now</i> or I may never do it.  That's why <i>now</i> is The ""Write"" Time!  I have a talent for writing that can be developed even more.  I have a wild imagination and strongly believe that I can promote a faith in Jesus through fictional works that subtly weave a message of faith into the story line.  They won't be ""Christian"" books, but mainstream genre books that show faith in a positive light.  That's the short story, now here are more details about the campaign my team has developed to help make this a <i>real </i>story of evangelization instead of just a pipe dream.</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>Chris needs time.  The old adage that 'time is money' is very accurate here.  The immediate goal of the ""It's the Write Time"" team is to raise $6,000 to cover his salary and the cost of perks &amp; fees for two months.  If we meet the goal early in the campaign there will be additional perks to raise more money to get to three months.</p>
<p>What happens if we don't make the $6,000?  As long as we reach $2,000 Chris will take two weeks to do as much work on a book as possible.  The perks will still be awarded, however, those related <span style=""background-color: initial;"">to the completion of the project </span><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">may take much longer.</span></p>

<h3>The Impact</h3> <p>A successful campaign will have Chris writing full time beginning July 1st and going through the end of August.  That will be at least 40 hours a week of writing, researching and brainstorming with probably a little bit of writer's block thrown in there.  A complete novel may not get accomplished in those 352 hours, but it will be an excellent start.  </p>

<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Many factions of the world as well as a majority of the media seem to think it is fair to pick on Christians and particularly Catholics.  The books that Chris writes will subtly present a proper view of Christianity and throw in a little bit of teaching on Catholic beliefs.  People may be surprised that they learn truths in a mainstream novel that are very different from what they were led to believe.  With the grace of God readers may choose to explore their faith (or be called to it) through this subtle method.  At the very least, we hope people will be less inclined to believe outright falsehoods just because they hear something on the news or read it on the internet.</span></p>

<p>It can be assured that the book won't be terrible.  Everybody has different opinions on reading material and some people might think it's not very good, but certainly any honest critic won't say it's terrible.  There's always a risk that a story may not appeal to a large group.  In that case, we'll learn from our experience, get better feedback from our audience and keep slowly working at it.  That's a great benefit to the ""It's the 'Write' Time"" campaign!  We're starting a community of followers interested in this work and able to give their input.  The hope is that the evangelization campaign will go on much longer after this financial campaign comes to an end.</p>
<p>Chris, the author, is currently in a unique position to be able to take time away from work.  His main position at a parish may not be available after he is gone for some months, but it's possible he could still get some hours.  Chris also delivers mail on Saturdays and will continue to do so during the writing process.  Afterwards, he can pick up extra hours at the post office.  Ultimately, the desire would be to work part-time so the writing can continue.  Writing as a profitable career is a long-term commitment for most authors.  Chris' wife, Jessie, who also serves as the Supreme Commander on the ""It's the Write Time"" campaign has a wonderful job helping local schools with their Career Technical Education programs.  It doesn't come with a great salary, but it does have great benefits so health insurance is not a concern for our family.</p>

<h3>Hi, my name is Amanda Katherine Loy.</h3>
<p>December of 2018, I had a preventative double mastectomy (aka I amputated my breasts) to prevent breast cancer. I have the BRCA 1 gene mutation, which raises my risk of developing breast cancer over my lifetime to up to 85%.</p>
<p>When I was going through the process of navigating surgery/genetic counseling etc, I felt SO alone. There are no resources for twenty something year olds navigating a genetic predisposition like this (or, for that matter, navigating breast cancer). And I made it my mission to CHANGE THAT.</p>
<p>And thus, <i>I Chopped Off My Tits, </i>my upcoming book was born. What started as me sharing the nitty gritty details of my story turned into a movement and, really, a book that not just womxn with my story can relate to, but anyone who has ever faced a traumatic event in their lifetime. It’s funny, it’s candid AF, it’s incredibly transparent and I’m so excited to birth this baby into the universe this December. </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>You might be wondering how you can help?</h3>
<p>The writing part of a book, well, other than the hours of my unpaid time as I’m self publishing this bad boy, is free. And truthfully, I would write this again in a heartbeat for NOTHING just to get this out to the masses. </p>
<p>That being said, there are a LOT of costs that are about to come straight out of my pocket:</p>
<ul>
<li>The photo shoot expenses for my book cover — to fund the space, the photographer, the design elements, hair/makeup — that alone is over $1500 all in. </li>
<li>Not to mention, the design work for the cover, getting the book printed, to fund my book launch party in Chicago (and possibly other cities), my time promoting the book as we go into launch season and promote on podcasts, tv shows, travel etc. It alll adds up! </li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Your Impact</h3>
<p>Your contribution to birthing this book into the world would help me not just cover the expenses of this massive project, but make a HUGE impact for spreading the awareness for BRCA and breast cancer in young women to the masses. </p>
<p>And any remaining funds that don’t go directly into the book will go STRAIGHT to Metavivor — a non profit who’s mission is to fund research for a cure for metastatic breast cancer, the only breast cancer that kills (that 1/3 women who ever get diagnosed with breast cancer will face in their lifetime) </p>

When I was going through the process of navigating surgery/genetic counseling etc, I felt SO alone. There are no resources for twenty something year olds navigating a genetic predisposition like this (or, for that matter, navigating breast cancer). And I made it my mission to CHANGE THAT.
And thus, I Chopped Off My Tits, my upcoming book was born. What started as me sharing the nitty gritty details of my story turned into a movement and, really, a book that not just womxn with my story can relate to, but anyone who has ever faced a traumatic event in their lifetime. It’s funny, it’s candid AF, it’s incredibly transparent and I’m so excited to birth this baby into the universe this December. 
 

You might be wondering how you can help?
The writing part of a book, well, other than the hours of my unpaid time as I’m self publishing this bad boy, is free. And truthfully, I would write this again in a heartbeat for NOTHING just to get this out to the masses. 
That being said, there are a LOT of costs that are about to come straight out of my pocket:

The photo shoot expenses for my book cover — to fund the space, the photographer, the design elements, hair/makeup — that alone is over $1500 all in. 
Not to mention, the design work for the cover, getting the book printed, to fund my book launch party in Chicago (and possibly other cities), my time promoting the book as we go into launch season and promote on podcasts, tv shows, travel etc. It alll adds up! 

 

Your Impact
Your contribution to birthing this book into the world would help me not just cover the expenses of this massive project, but make a HUGE impact for spreading the awareness for BRCA and breast cancer in young women to the masses. 
And any remaining funds that don’t go directly into the book will go STRAIGHT to Metavivor — a non profit who’s mission is to fund research for a cure for metastatic breast cancer, the only breast cancer that kills (that 1/3 women who ever get diagnosed with breast cancer will face in their lifetime) 
 
Other Ways You Can Help
Not able to financially contribute? Share this link to your socials! Help me get the word out about this book. Get on the list for as soon as it goes live on Amazon — www.amandakatherineloy.com/book 
EVERY VOICE COUNTS. We’re in this together and I’m SO grateful for you taking the time to support this cause and my book baby.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3><strong>Story of My Book</strong></h3>
<i>The Weight You Carry </i>- <i>The Weight You Carry </i>takes readers along on my 125-pound weight-loss journey and transformation into a new-found identity.<br/><br/>I am Tanner Jay, and I wrote The Weight You Carry, because I believe my story will help others with similar issues. I hope to better explain weight loss and the highs and lows of my journey.<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover the importance of having an identity in something other than the approval of others. In this book, I hope to instill the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for the importance of an identity in you. And then ultimately I want you to see this book as a tool to help you appreciate life more and not be consumed with the unrealistic expectation of trying to impress the world.<br/><br/>In this book, you'll learn about my 125 pound weight loss journey and the process of finding my identity:<p>The many struggles of growing up obese and finding my identity in the wrong places</p>
<p>Losing the weight and being able to hear the stories of others on similar journeys</p>
<p>Finding an identity and looking back on where I once found my purpose</p>
<p>You will relate to <i>The Weight You Carry </i>if you have struggled with self-image or sought the approval of others over your own self-worth. This is especially true for those seeking their real identity for the first time.</p>

<h3>
<strong>The Book </strong>- <i>The Weight You Carry</i>
</h3>
<p><br/>The book is written in 3 Parts....<br/><br/>Part 1 contains the introduction + six other chapters. From these chapters, a person will be able to see my story of growing up overweight and why I fell into obesity. Along with this, you will be able to understand my motivation to begin my weight-loss journey.<br/><br/>Part 2 contains Chapters 7-12. From these chapters the reader will be able to see the incredible weight loss I began and finished. The 125-pound weight-loss journey filled with a roller coaster of emotions allows the reader to get a feel for what it was like to partake in this transformation. Finally, the reader will see how my openness in sharing my story allowed others to open up about their own insecurities and struggles.<br/><br/>Part 3 contains Chapters 13-17. These chapters do a phenomenal job of showing the many false promises of weight loss. The reality of my life not being perfect after weight loss allows the reader to take a deeper dive into identity and see where I found purpose. This is paired with a call to action for the reader to further search for identity.<br/> </p>

<h2>The Story of My Book</h2>
<p>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover a shared affinity for character-based storytelling and immersive world building. In this book, I hope to instill in you the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for crime dramas. And ultimately, I hope this book is a tool to help you see your own story in a different light.<br/><br/>In this book, you'll learn about the difficult interactions between the primal drives of grief, longing, and the desire for revenge:</p>
<ul>
<li>A girl’s body is found, tangled in the mangroves of the river that splits a sleepy Florida town in two.</li>
<li>A young boy, Atticus, attempts to navigate a world that very clearly does not want him in it: as he observes without fully processing the grief of the community around him, he encounters a shifty newcomer outside of his local Church.</li>
<li>Newbury, fleeing hallucinatory visions and paranoid dreams of oceans on fire, stumbles into the swampy Florida heat without having processed a single moment of the week-long journey he’d just taken.</li>
</ul>
<p>You will love this book if you love character/crime dramas such as <i>Sharp Objects, True Detective, The Night Of, Breaking Bad, Haunting of Hill House</i>, and <i>Twin Peaks</i>.<br/><br/><i>Southing</i> is a novel that speaks to mystery and drama lovers who are looking for a poetic but brutal read.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>The Book - Southing</h2>
<p>The book is narrated by five speakers:<br/><br/>Newbury is an unreliable drifter who comes to Carrabelle, Florida, with an unknown agenda. He is haunted by visions of his past as well as the pervasive presence of his dead best friend, Warren.<br/><br/>Atticus is a young boy attempting to understand the nature of grief and loss in the community around him. With the death of Jaime, the girl found in the river, he must face the realities of the sometimes cruel world around him.<br/><br/>Dewey, Atticus’s older brother, is attempting to wrap his head around Jaime’s loss. Dewey, who had secretly admired Jaime from afar, has sunk himself<br/><br/>Callie is another outsider with a mysterious past, pulled into Dewey’s orbit at a high school party that serves as the catalyst for the ensuing events of the novel. After moving back to her father’s home town after a political scandal destroyed her family’s reputation, Callie’s narrative serves as a more stable outsider’s view of the town and some of its most influential figures.<br/><br/>Lastly are a series of chapters narrated by an omniscient figure impartial to the plot and the characters surrounding it. These “interludes,” titled only by the location in which the events described take place, give readers a birds-eye-view of ulterior developments surrounding Jaime’s case that the central four narrators are not aware of.</p>

<h3>About Before A Fall</h3>
<p>My name is Lee Daly and I'm a writer from Dublin, Ireland. I've been a huge PRIDE fan since I got the 2000 Grand Prix on a VHS tape nearly two decades ago and was always captivated by the glamour, grit and grievances that made the promotion so compelling. For years I wondered why there was no book on the history of PRIDE, before deciding to take the plunge and tackle it as a project.</p>
<p>I've been researching and writing for two years and have been very fortunate to have had help from fighters, commentators and journalists, all who have shared unique insights into what made PRIDE so special. Here's just some of the names featured: </p>
<ul>
<li>Bas Rutten </li>
<li>Stephen Quadros</li>
<li>Frank Shamrock</li>
<li>Minoru Suzuki</li>
<li>Erik Paulson</li>
<li>Frank Trigg</li>
</ul>
<p>Illustrator John Sheehan and I have been working hard to make the book a reality and we now want to share the results of our work with as many of our fellow fans as we can. That's where you come in. </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Why Crowdfund? </h3>
<p>With Before A Fall, we wanted to keep the fan ethos of the book intact, whilst also delivering as high a quality of a book as we can. </p>
<p>That means a fully self-published project and that requires money, so here's a breakdown of what we're fundraising for. </p>
<ul>
<li>€500 will go toward Indiegogo and processing fees.</li>
<li>€2000 will pay for the art work. </li>
<li>€2500 will go toward compiling and printing an initial run of 150 books.</li>
</ul>
<p>The book will go on general release before the end of September on Amazon, Kindle Store and will be available to order in select book stores.  However the campaign gives a great opportunity for us to share the book directly with you, and on top of the great rewards, you'll be helping us out as well.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Perks</h3>
<p>Of course, we're not expecting discerning MMA fans to hand over their money for nothing in return, and there are some awesome perks you'll get in return for your support. You can check them out on the right hand side of the page but the key thing to remember is the version you will get of the book will be unique to supporters of the Indiegogo campaign, with a cover not available on general release. </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What You Can Do</h3>
<ul>
<li>Contribute to the campaign. Every amount, big or small, helps. </li>
<li>Let us know your memories of PRIDE or what you're interested in.</li>
<li>Give the campaign a share or tell a friend! </li>
</ul>

For years I wondered why there was no book on the history of PRIDE, before deciding to take the plunge and tackle it as a project.
I've been researching and writing for two years and have been very fortunate to have had help from fighters, commentators and journalists, all who have shared unique insights into what made PRIDE so special. Here's just some of the names featured: 

Bas Rutten 
Stephen Quadros
Frank Shamrock
Minoru Suzuki
Erik Paulson
Frank Trigg

Illustrator John Sheehan and I have been working hard to make the book a reality and we now want to share the results of our work with as many of our fellow fans as we can. That's where you come in. 
 

Why Crowdfund? 
With Before A Fall, we wanted to keep the fan ethos of the book intact, whilst also delivering as high a quality of a book as we can. 
That means a fully self-published project and that requires money, so here's a breakdown of what we're fundraising for. 

€500 will go toward Indiegogo and processing fees.
€2000 will pay for the art work. 
€2500 will go toward compiling and printing an initial run of 150 books.

The book will go on general release before the end of September on Amazon, Kindle Store and will be available to order in select book stores.  However the campaign gives a great opportunity for us to share the book directly with you, and on top of the great rewards, you'll be helping us out as well.
 

The Perks
Of course, we're not expecting discerning MMA fans to hand over their money for nothing in return, and there are some awesome perks you'll get in return for your support. You can check them out on the right hand side of the page but the key thing to remember is the version you will get of the book will be unique to supporters of the Indiegogo campaign, with a cover not available on general release. 
 

What You Can Do

Contribute to the campaign. Every amount, big or small, helps. 
Let us know your memories of PRIDE or what you're interested in.
Give the campaign a share or tell a friend!

Firstly, we are launching a book, and a live program based upon it, that will help transformational authors enjoy a much higher degree of success.  At the heart of our campaign is a book – the first to be published by us – which represents the core message of our company: Write a Game Changing Self-Help Book: The Definitive Guide for Spiritual Entrepreneurs by Wisdompreneurs Publishing CEO Sasha Allenby. It is an essential book for emerging and developing authors in this field, from those who want to start out right the way through to those who have been previously published, but still wish to enjoy a higher level of reach and impact.Whether you are just starting out or already very well-established, this book and the programs based on it will help you define your unique voice and message in the industry. It supports growing authors to write the most effective and powerful self-help, personal development or spiritual book that is within their capacity to write; starting from scratch and taking them all the way through the process to the finished and marketable product in as little as 12 weeks.The second focus of our campaign is to fully launch Wisdompreneurs Publishing. Investing in this campaign not only means that you support a forward thinking company to get off the ground.  It means that when you and/or your colleagues are thinking of publishing, there will be a company here that will understand and respect your needs.  We will be here to help you negotiate the complex world of publishing and bringing your voice in front of the world.How You Can Get InvolvedFrom a $10 ebook version of the book to a customized booking coaching package including a fully designed marketing plan by 2 of the leaders in this sector, there are many ways to contribute to this campaign.  And each of them have been expertly crafted by people who currently make their living in the wisdom and personal development world - and have been doing so for many years.  At whatever level you contribute to this evolving company, we can assure you that it will not only improve your quality as a writer, and support you to get your book written and out into the world, but it also means that you are taking part in shaping a company that will bring forth the voices for the kind of future you want to live in!  Why This Campaign?Wisdom and personal development authors are often faced with the difficult choice of staying true to their message but having a book that has sub-optimal impact or going with a more business savvy publisher and being pressured to compromise their voice in order to maximize profits.  With a deep commitment to BOTH wisdom and world class entrepreneurial skills, Wisdompreneurs Publishing offers the transformational community a path of both staying true to their message and new levels of success and impact.Other Ways You Can HelpIf you like what you're hearing, share us with your friends! Our big-picture-goal is telling the industry ""this is transformational publishing done skillfully."" While Wisdompreneurs Publishing will teach us many things, we hope it also serves as a learning model for the wisdom and personal development industries - letting folks know there ARE effective ways to get emerging leaders voices heard.  Your voice matters!Questions? We’re happy to answer your questions about this campaign or any of the perks.  You can email Sasha at: info@wisdompreneurspublishing.com",1.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>What is Sweeping Zen?</h3>
<p>Established in 2009 as a grassroots initiative, Sweeping Zen is a digital archive of information on Zen Buddhism. Featuring in-depth interviews, an extensive database of biographies, news, articles, podcasts, teacher blogs, events, directories and more, this site is dedicated to offering the public a range of views in the sphere of Zen Buddhist thought.

<br/>During the last few years, maintaining Sweeping Zen has gone from a fun hobby to a rewarding full-time job. I believe we are a different kind of Buddhist media outlet — helping to shine a light on issues of importance to Zen communities. We are a publishing outlet committed to telling the truth.

What drives me in this work I’m doing is a deep and ongoing distrust for what often passes itself off as journalism these days. I believe only in reporting on what is.

<h3>The Basics</h3>
<p>My name is Mitzi and I am a personal trainer and yoga teacher based in Montreal, Quebec. </p>
<p>8 years ago I lost my mom to colon cancer. This past September, my dad was diagnosed with ALS, a terminal motor neuron disease. So I guess you could say I know a thing or two about stress...</p>
<p>I've been burnt out. I suffered from depression and anxiety. I cried myself to sleep every night.</p>
<p>And then I got out.</p>
<p>Out of the funk. Out of the darkness. Out of the haze.</p>
<p>It was a mixture of many different things, all of which began with baby steps. And in this e-book I will provide you with the 8 elements of self-care that I either used or have seen others use with success.</p>
<p>I’ve researched these topics extensively, trained in several and interviewed local experts on the subjects in order to provide the most in-depth look at each element.</p>
<p>What’s the issue here? We all experience stress but no one teaches you how to deal with it. No one teaches you how to care for yourself, period. And that is why this book is SO important.</p>
<p>The book will also include a home-workout plan, grocery list for healthy eating, yoga sequence and printable colouring pages.  </p>
<p>My targeted publishing date is November 30th or earlier. Let's make this happen! </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I'm hoping to raise $4,500 which will cover a multitude of costs that include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Upgrading my website and online store in order to sell a digital product</li>
<li>Paying professionals for editing and proofreading services, photography, marketing, etc. </li>
<li>Other related expenses like copywriting, software, and more</li>
</ul>
<p>I've put together some perks to reward you for your generosity. You can find them on the right side of this page.</p>
<p>I've created limited edition Mitzfitness #ThriveThroughSelfCare t-shirts JUST for this campaign! If you want to be the proud owner of one, now is your chance. </p>
<p>I'm also offering consultations on self-care, fitness or nutrition as well as the opportunity to host a fitness or yoga class with me in Montreal for you and 5 friends! </p>
<p>If I don't reach my goal, the funds raised will still go towards their intended use however my publishing date will be pushed to 2018. </p>
<p>If I surpass my goal, I will be printing copies of this book for organizations that deal with chronically or terminally ill patients as well as their caregivers since it is a stressful situation that I am all too familiar with.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Why Self-Care?</h3>
<p>Human beings, love to give give give and go go go. We hustle and bustle throughout our days sometimes without even stopping to eat (which is bad, don’t do that).</p>
<p>We are emptying our tanks of energy and barely replenishing it.</p>
<p>Taking just a few minutes each day to do something for ourselves has such a tremendous effect on the hormones and chemicals in our body which, in turn, affects our stress levels, mood and energy.</p>
<p>What is self care? Care of ourselves by ourselves. Grand or simple, self care is a way to ensure the we are filling our own ""cups"" of energy before filling others'. </p>
<p>Without it, we risk burn out, depression and the inability to honour our commitments, and responsibilities, or worse. </p>

<h3><strong>Story of My Book</strong></h3>
<i>Beyond Listening</i> is a look at how to understand your teenager from new perspectives. It uncovers ways to bridge the gap between parent and teen communication to build stronger healthier relationships. <br/><br/>My name is Lisa Jass, and I am the author of <i>Beyond Listening</i>. I wrote this book because, as a high school teacher, many of my students share their struggles of communicating with their parents with me. I felt inspired to do something to bridge this gap. Through my own experiences and those of teens, a lot of research, and my tools as a transformational coach for parents and teens, this book was born.<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover how the teenage brain works, the true differences in your teen’s life from yours, the importance of perspective, what it means to really listen, the importance of young people having adult mentors, and other tools for communication. In this book, I hope to instill in you as parents the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for really listening to my students (your kids) in you. Ultimately, I want you to see this book as a tool to help you build a healthy relationship with your adolescent child built on effective communication.<br/><br/>In this book, you'll learn about listening with more than your ears and the differences between then and now. You'll hear stories such as...<ul>
<li>When I was a teen, I almost got busted for curfew even though I was already in bed. </li>
<li>Young Clint Pulver used to get in trouble at school until one teacher realized his potential.</li>
<li>How the misunderstanding of a word from a teen had a school nurse thinking a mother may be abusing her child. </li>
</ul>You will love this book if you are a parent of a teen, if you deal with teenagers in any way, if you have trouble communicating.<br/><br/><i>Beyond Listening</i> is a nonfiction book that speaks to parents of teenagers and teachers or coaches who want to look at communication and listening in a new way.<br/><br/> <h3><strong>What I Need &amp; What You'll Get</strong></h3>
<p>This book will be published with New Degree Press. I set up the pre-order tiers to help cover the costs for publishing my book. Money raised will go towards the following:</p>

<li>The copy editing for my book to polish the grammar and spelling prior to publication.</li>
<li>The launch &amp; promotion efforts for my book when I ultimately publish this Summer.</li>
</ul>
<p><br/>When I pre-sell 120 copies of my book, I will publish a paperback and ebook. When I pre-sell 150 copies of my book, I will also publish a hardcover edition.

Beyond Listening is a look at how to understand your teenager from new perspectives. It uncovers ways to bridge the gap between parent and teen communication to build stronger healthier relationships. My name is Lisa Jass, and I am the author of Beyond Listening. I wrote this book because, as a high school teacher, many of my students share their struggles of communicating with their parents with me. I felt inspired to do something to bridge this gap. Through my own experiences and those of teens, a lot of research, and my tools as a transformational coach for parents and teens, this book was born.My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover how the teenage brain works, the true differences in your teen’s life from yours, the importance of perspective, what it means to really listen, the importance of young people having adult mentors, and other tools for communication. In this book, I hope to instill in you as parents the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for really listening to my students (your kids) in you. Ultimately, I want you to see this book as a tool to help you build a healthy relationship with your adolescent child built on effective communication.In this book, you'll learn about listening with more than your ears and the differences between then and now. You'll hear stories such as...
When I was a teen, I almost got busted for curfew even though I was already in bed. 
Young Clint Pulver used to get in trouble at school until one teacher realized his potential.
How the misunderstanding of a word from a teen had a school nurse thinking a mother may be abusing her child. 
You will love this book if you are a parent of a teen, if you deal with teenagers in any way, if you have trouble communicating.Beyond Listening is a nonfiction book that speaks to parents of teenagers and teachers or coaches who want to look at communication and listening in a new way. What I Need & What You'll Get
This book will be published with New Degree Press. I set up the pre-order tiers to help cover the costs for publishing my book. Money raised will go towards the following:

The editor I will work with to revise and publish my manuscript in August, 2021.
The cover design of my book. (The mockups you see currently are a placeholder!)
The layout design for the interior of my book (physical copy, ebook formats).
The copy editing for my book to polish the grammar and spelling prior to publication.
The launch & promotion efforts for my book when I ultimately publish this Summer.

When I pre-sell 120 copies of my book, I will publish a paperback and ebook. When I pre-sell 150 copies of my book, I will also publish a hardcover edition. When I pre-sell 200 copies of my book, I will publish a hardcover edition and an audiobook.I am also offering some exclusive rewards for people who pre-order my book now:

You will receive a personally signed copy of my book when I publish.
Your name will appear in the Acknowledgments section of my book.
You will receive early access to the Introduction and other excerpts from my book, with the opportunity to review them and give me early feedback.
You will have the opportunity to be involved in selecting my cover and title.
You will be invited to join my Author Community and get behind-the-scenes sneak peeks into the publishing process.
And much more!

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p> </p>
<p><i>Beyond the Surface:  Empathy, Identity, and Storytelling</i> is a humanizing look at what makes us who we are and how we can use stories to respect and honor each other's perspectives and identities. <br/><br/>My name is Teresa Xu, and I am the author of <i>The Beginning to the End</i>. I wrote this book because empathy has always been important to me, and I wanted to share my perspective on being respectful in a particularly troubling time for the world.<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover parts of yourself and others you never really thought about before, that you will pay closer attention to the people around you. I want you to see this book as an opportunity to learn with me about the importance of understanding and respecting different walks of life.</p>
<p>In this book, you'll encounter multifaceted dimensions of empathy, identity, and diversity, and how storytelling can build meaningful connections and bridge divisions, through narratives like:</p>
<ul>
<li>My first story exchange with Narrative 4 and how it opened my eyes to a new way of learning about people and <i>feeling </i>their experiences</li>
<li><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Brandon Stanton realizing after meeting Barack Obama that you can't necessarily judge someone by one moment</span></li>
<li><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">The power of writing in respecting identities and telling stories through Girls Write Now</span></li>
</ul>
<p>You will love this book if you are passionate about amplifying underrepresented voices and really, if you simply care about others.<br/><br/><i>The Beginning to the End</i> speaks to educators, artists, advocates and activists who want to grapple with equity and storytelling in a new way.<br/><br/>Ultimately, I hope that <i>The Beginning to the End</i> inspires reflection and fruitful dialogue, pressing into engaging questions like:</p>
<p>How do I view myself and form perceptions about others?</p>
<p>How might I share my voice through a form of art? What should I keep in mind if I want to tell someone else's story?</p>
<p>How might we slowly address structural problems by first understanding how we can make changes in our individual, everyday lives?</p>
<p>I look forward to exploring these questions and beyond with my readers. I believe discussing how our identities function in our daily lives, how they relate to inclusion efforts, and how they can be represented through storytelling will change us all for the better.</p>

<h3>What is the Fantasy Football Magazine?</h3>
<p>The Fantasy Football Magazine is transforming the way Fantasy Premier League managers play the game.</p>
<p>Focusing on strategy, tactics and advice, the <a href=""https://issuu.com/fantasyfootballmag/docs/ffm4"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">first edition</a> was read by thousands of FPL managers looking for something different in an industry that can often feel like an echo-chamber of obvious captaincy tips and dull differential picks.</p>
<p>With in-depth contributions from the best fantasy football pundits, thinkers and analysts in the industry, the Fantasy Football Magazine is essential reading for any manager looking to genuinely improve their FPL performance.</p>
<p>With this campaign, we want to create monthly editions across the 17/18 season, send print copies to readers across the world and develop our digital offerings to make access to the free e-magazine easier than ever before.</p>
<p><i>""They've managed to create something stylish, comprehensive and genuinely useful."" - fantasyfootballpundits.com</i></p>
<p><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1493153847/iuklaypwuha9pg34jcyb.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h3>
<br/><strong>What's Inside?</strong>
</h3>
<p>The Fantasy Football Magazine looks at the fundamentals of FPL strategy whilst keeping a finger firmly on the pulse of those changing FPL trends and fluctuations.</p>
<p>Releasing the magazine monthly gives us the ability to acknowledge the current FPL trends without succumbing to the temptation to react to short-term, explosive changes. The perfect balance.</p>
<p>Alongside the contemporary advice, we’ll focus on timeless theory and tactics too. Last edition examined topics like the psychology behind transfer decisions, game theory, in-depth statistical analysis and even featured an interview with a former world champion.</p>

<h3>
<br/>Magazines Delivered Straight to Your Door</h3>
<p>It’s high time that FPL had a print magazine. We counted 5 fishing magazines in WHSmith last week, and yet, with millions of managers worldwide, there isn’t a single fantasy football publication to flick through...Until now.</p>
<p>We’ll be sending out<strong> </strong>beautiful printed copies of our monthly magazine throughout the 17/18 season, starting with a special pre-season guide to get your best FPL campaign yet off on the right foot. It’s time to start looking out for the postman again.</p>

<h3>
<br/>Anytime, Anywhere, Any Device</h3>
</div><div>
<p>Having listened to our reader's feedback, we understand that an accessible e-magazine doesn't just mean free-of-charge, it means usability, compatibility and functionality. </p>
<p>We want to raise funds to vastly improve the design, layout and format of our website and e-magazines. This includes the introduction of responsive turn-page technology<strong> </strong>and distributing the magazine across all major e-book apps too.</p>

<h3>
<br/>Why We Need You</h3>
<p>You might still be wondering why we're asking for your help.</p>
<p>Well, the answer is pretty straight forward. The Fantasy Football Magazine cannot continue without it. The main costs of producing a fully-fledged, monthly magazine are as follows:</p>
<p><strong>Image Licensing</strong></p>
<p>A magazine is nothing without fantastic images. We've been approved by the Premier League's licensing body to use official images, now we've just got to pay for them. The necessary image license will cost us £4,000 (£400 per issue) for the season.</p>
<p><strong>Product Development</strong>  </p>
<p>We want all of our digital and print offerings to look and feel perfect. This means investment in the development of the magazine, focusing on improved design and usability. If you thought the 1st Edition looked the part, you've seen nothing yet.</p>
<p><strong>Writer/Designer Fees</strong></p>
<p>We will always be a publication that pays its writers and designers. We want the best, and it's important to us that we pay for it.</p>
<p>As you can see, the initial funds needed to get this off the ground are too overwhelming for us to tackle alone. We parted with a lot of our personal money to create the first edition, and that was without image licensing or print copies.</p>
<p>Quite simply, if the Fantasy Football Magazine is going to be around next season, it needs your support.<br/> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1493589841/boyr6xi5bgewhp8zcol9.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h3>
<br/>What's In It For You?</h3>
<p>Well, firstly, a free Fantasy Premier League e-magazine. Our digital magazines will always be free, and this will never change.</p>
<p>Every perk is discounted exclusively for Indiegogo. We also have an enticing array of referral rewards that will never be available again. To put it bluntly, there's never been a better time to get behind the Fantasy Football Magazine.</p>
<p>We've put time and research into our rewards, always with an eye on the feasibility of delivery. We surveyed our readers extensively and we looked at what other magazines are doing too. The result, we hope, is a competitively priced range of fantastic perks that our readers have asked for, and that we<i> know</i> we can deliver.<br/> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1493665573/t9dhcr3azwv0kqspuxu4.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h3>
<br/><strong>Why Crowdfunding?</strong>
</h3>
<p>Going through crowdfunding kills two birds with one John Stones. Firstly, it gives us the opportunity to raise the necessary funds. </p>
<p>Secondly, it enables readers to become actively engaged with the success and progress of the Fantasy Football Magazine. By supporting us today, you become a direct beneficiary of the Fantasy Football Magazine, and a massive contributing factor to its development.</p>
</div><div>
<p>Our perks are priced on the basis that we will be able to offer a beautiful, monthly print magazine, sleek, usable e-magazines and a much improved reader experience as of next season.</p>
<p>Our fixed financial target reflects those aims. We cannot deliver the product our backers expect without that money, so, in the event that we do not reach our goal, we’ll have to come up with a plan B. Perhaps we’ll hire Marco Silva in the hopes he can dig us out of trouble.</p>
<p>It also means you can be confident that you’ll only be charged for a high quality product that has been created with the funds we’ve asked for.<br/> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1493665415/i8mkowyuywh2uw1k7dk3.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h3>
<br/>Referral Contest</h3>
<p>Our referral contest is perfect for those who have backed the campaign and want to spread the word further.</p>
<p>Share our campaign with your mini-league's Whatsapp group, send it to your colleagues in an email or plaster it on your Facebook feed. If just 2 of your friends purchase the subscription perk, you'll already be on the first rung of our bonus ladder.<br/><br/>Referring others is easy, but you'll need to have already backed the campaign to get started. Simply log into your Indiegogo account and use Indiegogo’s share tools to get posting. They'll use their analytics to track your progress, and we'll be in touch if you pass one of the milestones. You can also check your referrals yourself through your Indiegogo profile.</p>

</div></div>","What is the Fantasy Football Magazine?
The Fantasy Football Magazine is transforming the way Fantasy Premier League managers play the game.
Focusing on strategy, tactics and advice, the first edition was read by thousands of FPL managers looking for something different in an industry that can often feel like an echo-chamber of obvious captaincy tips and dull differential picks.
With in-depth contributions from the best fantasy football pundits, thinkers and analysts in the industry, the Fantasy Football Magazine is essential reading for any manager looking to genuinely improve their FPL performance.
With this campaign, we want to create monthly editions across the 17/18 season, send print copies to readers across the world and develop our digital offerings to make access to the free e-magazine easier than ever before.
""They've managed to create something stylish, comprehensive and genuinely useful."" - fantasyfootballpundits.com


What's Inside?

The Fantasy Football Magazine looks at the fundamentals of FPL strategy whilst keeping a finger firmly on the pulse of those changing FPL trends and fluctuations.
Releasing the magazine monthly gives us the ability to acknowledge the current FPL trends without succumbing to the temptation to react to short-term, explosive changes. The perfect balance.
Alongside the contemporary advice, we’ll focus on timeless theory and tactics too. Last edition examined topics like the psychology behind transfer decisions, game theory, in-depth statistical analysis and even featured an interview with a former world champion.
""The Fantasy Football Magazine is a refreshing and welcome addition to the FPL scene. A bible of FPL words."" - fantasyfootball247.co.uk


Magazines Delivered Straight to Your Door
It’s high time that FPL had a print magazine. We counted 5 fishing magazines in WHSmith last week, and yet, with millions of managers worldwide, there isn’t a single fantasy football publication to flick through...Until now.
We’ll be sending out beautiful printed copies of our monthly magazine throughout the 17/18 season, starting with a special pre-season guide to get your best FPL campaign yet off on the right foot. It’s time to start looking out for the postman again.
“Whether you're a novice or an expert, the Fantasy Football Mag is for you. A truly groundbreaking publication” - fplbet.com 


Anytime, Anywhere, Any Device

Having listened to our reader's feedback, we understand that an accessible e-magazine doesn't just mean free-of-charge, it means usability, compatibility and functionality. 
We want to raise funds to vastly improve the design, layout and format of our website and e-magazines. This includes the introduction of responsive turn-page technology and distributing the magazine across all major e-book apps too.
""FFMag has filled a big hole in the market. I now have all the info in one place, instead of trying to keep up with the 100 FPL accounts on Twitter!""- Mark Donaldson, ESPN 


Why We Need You
You might still be wondering why we're asking for your help.
Well, the answer is pretty straight forward. The Fantasy Football Magazine cannot continue without it. The main costs of producing a fully-fledged, monthly magazine are as follows:
Image Licensing
A magazine is nothing without fantastic images. We've been approved by the Premier League's licensing body to use official images, now we've just got to pay for them. The necessary image license will cost us £4,000 (£400 per issue) for the season.
Product Development  
We want all of our digital and print offerings to look and feel perfect. This means investment in the development of the magazine, focusing on improved design and usability. If you thought the 1st Edition looked the part, you've seen nothing yet.
Writer/Designer Fees
We will always be a publication that pays its writers and designers. We want the best, and it's important to us that we pay for it.
As you can see, the initial funds needed to get this off the ground are too overwhelming for us to tackle alone. We parted with a lot of our personal money to create the first edition, and that was without image licensing or print copies.
Quite simply, if the Fantasy Football Magazine is going to be around next season, it needs your support. 


What's In It For You?
Well, firstly, a free Fantasy Premier League e-magazine. Our digital magazines will always be free, and this will never change.
Every perk is discounted exclusively for Indiegogo. We also have an enticing array of referral rewards that will never be available again. To put it bluntly, there's never been a better time to get behind the Fantasy Football Magazine.
We've put time and research into our rewards, always with an eye on the feasibility of delivery. We surveyed our readers extensively and we looked at what other magazines are doing too. The result, we hope, is a competitively priced range of fantastic perks that our readers have asked for, and that we know we can deliver. 


Why Crowdfunding?

Going through crowdfunding kills two birds with one John Stones. Firstly, it gives us the opportunity to raise the necessary funds. 
Secondly, it enables readers to become actively engaged with the success and progress of the Fantasy Football Magazine. By supporting us today, you become a direct beneficiary of the Fantasy Football Magazine, and a massive contributing factor to its development.

Our perks are priced on the basis that we will be able to offer a beautiful, monthly print magazine, sleek, usable e-magazines and a much improved reader experience as of next season.
Our fixed financial target reflects those aims. We cannot deliver the product our backers expect without that money, so, in the event that we do not reach our goal, we’ll have to come up with a plan B. Perhaps we’ll hire Marco Silva in the hopes he can dig us out of trouble.
It also means you can be confident that you’ll only be charged for a high quality product that has been created with the funds we’ve asked for. 


Referral Contest
Our referral contest is perfect for those who have backed the campaign and want to spread the word further.
Share our campaign with your mini-league's Whatsapp group, send it to your colleagues in an email or plaster it on your Facebook feed. If just 2 of your friends purchase the subscription perk, you'll already be on the first rung of our bonus ladder.Referring others is easy, but you'll need to have already backed the campaign to get started. Simply log into your Indiegogo account and use Indiegogo’s share tools to get posting. They'll use their analytics to track your progress, and we'll be in touch if you pass one of the milestones. You can also check your referrals yourself through your Indiegogo profile.
For more info, read Indiegogo's guide on how to participate in referral contests.

<p>My stage name is LatinoA2J, which stands for ‘Addicted 2 Jesus.”  I was born, Nelson Marrero,  in Brooklyn New York.  I enlisted in the US Marine Corp where I learned structure, discipline and pride; traits that were not fostered by the men in my life.  I remember my mother telling me to become something greater than the men in my life…the only problem was I had no role models to guide me.  That all changed when I met a man that led me to the only role model I would ever need in my life…the person of Jesus Christ.  In one single moment I accomplished the wishes of my mother and I became a ‘greater man’ because of He that came to reside in my heart.   I have now been a Christian for over 25 years and for almost 20 of those years I have been active in many areas of youth, young adults and men’s ministry.  I received my Certificate of Christian Ministry from Boyce Bible College and will soon graduate from Bethel College and accredited with the Assembly of God church.  I am currently co-hosting a Blog Talk Radio Show (The Artist Outlet Consortium) that features poets from all over the United States.</p>
<p>My vision is to enter the entertainment field and to help young Christian men and women realize that the Christian life can be lived with power as long as our focus is always Christ Jesus.  God has given me the opportunity to introduce others to the One that can bring those trapped in darkness into the light of God’s loving mercy and grace.  You too can be a part of this ministry by supporting my efforts<br/> </p>

<h2>Story of My Book</h2>Abigail is a book that centers around a teenage girl that is saved from her sadistic mother by a young man and in return, she has to help him save other girls. Atlanta is a hard place to survive. Abigail knows that all too well, but there are tougher obstacles than just the world around her. Can she find the strength to trust again?<br/><br/>My name is Gloria Kitchens and I am the author of Abigail. I wrote this book because I wanted to explore a futuristic setting in a place I know very well, Atlanta. I’ve always been interested in what the future would look like and I think a story of trust and identity helps solidify the setting 150 years in the future.<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover that it gets easier to trust people again. I hope to instill the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for friendship and trust in you. And ultimately, I want this book to be a tool to help you see how starting to trust people again can help you continue moving forward in finding yourself as Abigail does.<br/><br/>In this book, you'll learn about friendship and trust:<p>Abigail learns to trust the man who saves her.</p>
<p>Abby finds herself in order to help save other people like her.</p>
<p>You will love this book if you like the fast-paced nature of heists as well as how much the world will change in hundreds of years. Abigail is a fiction book that speaks to young adults and sci-fi lovers who are looking at the darkness and light of people for the first time.</p>
<h2>The Book - Abigail</h2> The book is written in 3 Parts....<br/><br/>Part 1 contains the Introduction + additional chapters.

Where Abby finally explores life inside the city dome of Atlanta while also figuring out how she could be useful in saving other girls like her<br/><br/>Part 3 contains Chapters 10-14. Where Abby and the man who saved her must figure out a way to save as many people as possible against all odds<br/> <h2>What I Need &amp; What You'll Get</h2> This book will be published with New Degree Press. I set up the pre-order tiers to help cover the costs for publishing my book.

<h2>About the Author</h2>
<p>Gloria Kitchens is a student of Tufts University studying Applied Mathematics and Computer Science. She wrote this book because she feels that the voice of a young adult minority would be valuable in the science fiction genre. In her spare time, she’s usually breaking computer programs with her subpar coding skills or breaking many other important things while playing rugby.<br/><br/>For more information you can connect with Gloria at gloria.kitchens@tufts.edu and on LinkedIn.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Risks &amp; Challenges</h2>
<p>The biggest challenge with publishing a book is delivering the finished book to the backer, specifically my mailing of the book to you. I have eliminated this risk by building into the campaign the mailing and shipping costs of your signed copies to you within each pre-order tier.<br/><br/>The risk of delivering the pre-sale copies of my book is contingent on the publisher we use. I will be working closely with New Degree Press to make sure we get the earliest possible ship date of the signed book copy to you.

<h3>Story of My Book </h3>
<p>The Apprentice Mindset is a book about how mastery, purpose, and success can be found by apprenticing experts.</p>
<p>My name is Katarvia Taylor, and I am the author of The Apprentice Mindset. I wrote this book because after years of observing, working with, and studying people who achieved stratospheric success, I wanted to share what I discovered was that catalyst and most important key to their achievement – without fail, 100% of them either had an apprenticeship relationship and/or an apprentice mindset. I then decided to take a deeper dive and explore their stories, the notion of apprenticeships, and how since the beginning of time apprenticeships have been the key to unlocking potential and helping humanity find purpose and success.  </p>
<p>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will become inspired and motivated by the stories of well-known and not so-well-known individuals who deliberately sought out and/or submitted themselves to the masters of their fields. And because iron sharpens iron, these apprentices discovered, honed, and developed their potential to a point where they achieved mastery and went on to make significant contributions in their industries, society, and the world. In this book, I hope to share with you the same sort of passion and excitement that I found in learning more about the master/apprentice pairs presented. Ultimately, I want you to see this book as a tool to help you realize that purpose, mastery, and success are not solely discovered through an internal introspective process but also by taking on the mindset of an apprentice and placing oneself in the orbit of a master. A well-developed internal compass is not always the primary key to finding your way in life. Taking a journey with experienced masters will guide you toward finding your own path toward destiny and success.</p>
<p>In this book, you'll learn about how apprenticeships lead to the acquisition of tacit knowledge and mastery through observation, imitation, and eventually finding one’s voice and way.    You'll hear stories such as...</p>
<p>How Jamie Dimon’s decision to turn down offers from Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, and Lehman Brothers to apprentice Sandy Weill when he was President at American Express gave Dimon the opportunity to learn how to successfully manage billion-dollar mergers and acquisitions fresh out of Harvard Business School.</p>
<p>How Congressman Charlie Rangel and the first-ever US Trade Representative for Africa Rosa Whitaker were two of the key architects of the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA), the cornerstone of the United States’ trade policy with Africa. Whitaker worked with Congressman Rangel and learned how relationship building, negotiation, and consensus building are key to getting tough things done.</p>
<p>Cellists Pablo Casals and Bernard Greenhouse and how apprenticeships among top musicians is a lesson in how imitation can lead to improvisation and innovation.</p>
<p>You will also hear stories of how:</p>
<p>An ocean enthusiast apprenticed his father to become one of the top dive instructors and foremost experts on marine conservation.</p>
<p>A church’s protégé program became the ultimate apprenticeship model for creating a pipeline of leaders to drive the expansion of its programs in Washington, DC.</p>
<p>The Apprentice Mindset is a nonfiction book that speaks to students, recent college graduates, young professionals, and those looking to change their careers. It provides a new way to look at the notion of finding purpose and success.</p>
<h3>The Book - The Apprentice Mindset</h3>
<p>The book is written in 3 parts.</p>
<ul><li>Part 1 contains the introduction + chapters 1-3. In the section, I present the case for apprenticeships. I look at the history and benefits of apprenticeships and show how they are different from other key relationships – advisory and mentorships. I argue here that what makes an apprenticeship particularly powerful is that it is formalized and intentional.</li></ul>
<p> </p>
<ul><li>Part 2 contains chapters 4-8. The focus of the main part of the book is on the Apprentice Mindset. Here I share stories of master/apprentice pairs and use research to dissect and explore what made the apprentice a success. I look at concepts such as the acquisition of tacit knowledge through observation; imitation v. emulation; learning unwritten rules; and how masters in the end are gatekeepers and door “unlockers” who consciously and unconsciously guide their apprentices to success.  </li></ul>
<p> </p>
<ul><li>Part 3 contains chapters 9-10. In this application section, I look at how masters and apprentices can make the most of the relationship. I also explore the the inevitable challenges and difficulties that come with any relationship and how they can be navigated.   </li></ul>

And if that’s not your style, I want you to enjoy the stories of individuals, products and brands absolutely breaking the internet!</p><p><br/>In this book, you’ll learn that A LOT of influencers secure multi-million dollar earning years from their content creation efforts and how you can start on the same path:</p><ul>
<li>How a 7-year-old earned $22 million dollars on YouTube in 1 year</li>
<li>How one of my high school teammates' art took off on Instagram, and proved to me that it really is possible to grow an audience</li>
<li>Why you should take a long-term approach to your growth efforts, what exactly that means, and how you can take the first step</li>
<li>And some stories that I just think are cool</li>
</ul><p>You will love this book if you are a casual social media user, entrepreneur looking to up their game online, or are curious about ways people have intentionally gone viral on the internet. How to Make a Blindfolded Free Throw is a non-fiction book that speaks to social media users and content creators who are looking at growing their audience online, and creating the best content they can for the first time<br/> </p><h3><strong>The Book - How to Make a Blindfolded Free Throw</strong></h3><p>My book is written in 4 parts...<br/><br/>Part 1 Contains the introduction with some personal stories on my successes and failures trying to grow audiences online. A generation ago, kids grew up wanting to become doctors, teachers, astronauts, and professional athletes. The world has changed, and a recent study found that 34% of kids want to become YouTubers when they grow up and another 14% want to become bloggers/vloggers. In terms of the blindfolded free throw: if these kids shoot their first shot without practice or guidance, it’s very unlikely to go in. However, if they improve their form and consistently practice, they are much more likely to ‘score’ and go viral.<br/><br/>Part 2 contains a differentiation between the two most important elements of your content’s ‘form’: the medium and the message. With the help of top media theorists, I first differentiate between the medium and the message with tricks to best utilize each. I dive into how Dollar Shave Club created a viral advertisement and Joey Bada$$ schemed YouTube with their own twist on ‘perfect form.’ And I remind you, that if your content doesn’t perform as well as you hoped, that's data and data is your friend.<br/><br/>Part 3 contains a couple of different methods to consistently have content to upload to each platform. Methodologies span from being helpful to students on a budget, parents or children looking to merge family fun with internet growth, and entrepreneurs looking to take their web-game to the next level. A plug to the man who’s killing it with his content: Gary Vee’s Pillar Content Deck on LinkedIn is necessary to read.<br/><br/>Part 4 is an attempt to turn long-term audience size and content performance into an algorithm. I intend for this part to stand-alone, and be read more as a general ‘social media theory,’ than an actionable set of steps to follow. I was educated with an interdisciplinary approach for my entirety of school, and have always been fascinated by concepts that are transitive between what I'll call cousin disciplines. I believe Economics and Digital Marketing are cousin disciplines, and explain why.<br/><br/>Part 5 is an action check list. I believe strongly in massive action, and if you complete the steps on this check-list RIGHT NOW, you WILL see at least some results. <br/><br/> </p><h3>What I Need &amp; What You'll Get</h3><p><br/>This book will be published with New Degree Press.

<h3>Our Story   </h3>
<p>DJ Andrews desired a life of significance. To that end, she agreed to trust God and obey His voice - no matter the cost.  Since that time, her life became anything <em>but</em> normal!  The true stories shared in this book will encourage readers to explore deeper levels of faith than ever before.   </p>
<p> </p>
<p>This ""ordinary"" woman, who's lived an extraordinary life, has organized events for thousands, many of whom were introduced to faith in God for the very first time, ran companies with no prior experience and even left a vibrant career behind to travel half-way across the world with a family of five, to a place completely unknown to them, simply because it was asked of them.  With this move came no backing organization, no jobs, no friends and no idea as to why they'd been asked to ""go""- and yet, in faith and in obedience, they went!</p>
<p>  </p>
<p>Although DJ Andrews' faith was tested many times, through financial hardship, chronic illness, personal opposition and more, her story also chronicles a life lived in the miraculous - dreams, visions and incredible God-ordained encounters.  She experienced first-hand, the power of God at work in, and through, the anointed arts!  </p>
<p> </p>
<p><em>""You Want Me To Do WHAT?""</em> has been accepted for publication by WinePress Publishing and is currently ready for editing and printing. This is where YOU come in...  <br/></p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>These are difficult times.  Folks need encouragement.  They need to understand that even on the darkest of days, God is with them.  They need to witness and receive testimony of a life of faith to which they can relate.  There are many stories of persecution in the faith from other countries, which are riveting and truly compelling but not many from the vantage point of a ""regular"" person from the western world.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>DJ Andrews has spent 14 years living this story and 3 years writing it and believes, strongly, that this is a story which must be heard. Please participate in encouraging others in their walk, by giving what you can so that this story, and the valuable lessons learned, can be shared.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><em>""You Want Me To Do WHAT?""</em> will challenge those new to faith in God and strengthen those who already live by faith.</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Immediate Hard Costs: $2500 for editing</p>
<p>Eventual Hard Costs:   $18,310 for typesetting, design and the printing of 5000 books </p>
<p>Website Cost:  $5000</p>
<p> </p>
<p>A large percentage of the marketing will emanate from/via ArtsBridge International website. </p>
<p>The publishing company will market to book stores, Amazon.com and trade shows.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p><u>OUR OFFER TO YOU!!</u></p>
<p> </p>
<p>While the IndieGoGo campaign goal is $18,000, we believe that we will achieve our goal to raise $25,500 in order that we might create a product of excellence.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>If however, we do not receive the necessary funds to print 5000 off-set, high quality books, then we'll switch to the print-on-demand option, which has a lower up-front cost, but a higher cost incurred for each and every book printed. This way, even if we don't acheive our goal, we do have another option for putting those donations to good use.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>If we DO receive the necessary funds to print the book, this is what we'll do:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>*For every donation of $40+, YOU will receive a signed copy of the book</p>
<p> </p>
<p>*For every donation of $100+, YOU will receive a signed copy of the book <em>plus</em> we will donate two books to missionaries of your choice</p>
<p> </p>
<p>*For each subsequent gift of $100, the same as above will apply </p>
<p> </p>
<p>ie) a $300 gift would mean - 3 copies of a signed book for YOU and six books go to missionaries. If you don't know that many missionaries, we have access to names. AND... if you have access to names that you'd like to give us, we're open to receiving those names and addresses from you and will add them to our list of possible recipients. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>We believe the Christian missionaries will be greatly encouraged by this gift which is why we have chosen to bless them in this way.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>*For every gift of $1000+,you will receive the same as above and you might even get a hug!  Actually, we are open to suggestions for this level of giving.  </p>

THE VOLTA BOOK OF POETS would not be possible if not for the generosity of the presses who granted permission to reprint the poems collected in this anthology, including: 1913 Press; Action Books; Ahsahta Press; Apogee Press; Birds LLC; Black Lawrence Press; Black Ocean; Black Square Editions; City Lights Publishing; Cleveland State University Poetry Center; Counterpath Press; Dalkey Archive; Dorothy, a publishing project; Edge Books; Farfalla Press / McMillan; Fence Books; Flood Editions; Four Way Books; Futurepoem Books; Kenning Editions; Letter Machine Editions; Litmus Press; Noemi Press; Octopus Books; Omnidawn Publishing; Owl Press; W.W. Norton; and Wave Books.

</p><p><b>Who I am</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>Hello, I am Elliott DeLine. I am a 25 year old writer who also happens to be a transgender man. I have 2 books,<i> Refuse</i> and <i>I Know Very Well
How I Got My Name. </i>In 2011, <i>Refuse </i>was a finalist in the Rainbow Book Awards in several categories .
In 2013,<i> I Know Very Well How I Got My Name</i> was the winner for Best Transgender Fiction. I have also written
for <i>Original Plumbing, The New York Times</i>, Trans-Genre.net, and other
publications.  I had a short story in <i>The Collection</i>, a transgender
anthology which won the 2012 Lambda Literary Award.  My work has
received favorable reviews from <i>Kirkus Reviews, Out in Print Queer Book
Reviews, Lambda Literary, </i>and <i>Publishers’ Weekly, </i>to name a few.  Mark Simpson, a British
journalist for <i>The Guardian</i> and the author of <i>Saint Morrissey</i>, called my first novel
“irresistible.”  <i>Kirkus Reviews</i> referred to my work as “well written,
nuanced…pioneering examples of transgender fiction.” My writing has been read by
gender studies and literature classes at New York University, Trent University,
The New School, SUNY Fredonia, Onondaga Community College, and more. Despite this, my
work remains largely unknown to the general public as well as within the
transgender community. This is because I have extremely limited promotional
power. I work almost entirely on my own with no budget.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Short
Summary</b></p>
<p>I want 2014 to be the year I
take the world by storm. Or at least the literary world. Or at least the queer
literary world. I intend to be busy writing, but I also want to travel in order
to have a presence at several fancy events in fancy cities. Last year I was
able to publish my second book and also make *appearances* in New York, San
Francisco, Philadelphia, Ontario, Fredonia, and more, signing my books and
reading to audiences. However, I quickly learned was very expensive. Midway through 2013, I was also dealt a blow when
I was fired from my day job. It was a very shady situation. The only reason I
was able to achieve what I did was because of my readers- either because they
set up paid gigs for me, bought my books, or contributed to my previous
crowd-funding campaigns in 2013. My current income comes from book sales and odd jobs and usually rounds out to only a couple hundred dollars a month. Luckily I have supportive parents who have been able to house me for quite some time. I don't want pity, because I'm quite fortunate in this regard. I only tell you this so you understand why I'm asking for assistance. </p>

</p><p>Hi, I’m Gemma Stone. I’m writing a book and I’d love to
share it with you. It’s called The Art and Science of Designing a Life You
Love.</p>
<p>This book is for everyone who feels called to live a
truthful and fulfilling life. It’s for everyone who has felt afraid to
make the changes they want to make.</p>
<p>The Art and Science of Designing a Life You Love is about
how to live &amp; be in the world. But it’s not about my way – it’s about

<p>I’m a psychologist and the Art and Science of Designing a
Life You Love is all about psychology of soulful change.</p>
<p>Within us is the ability to design our lives the way we want
them to be. Sometimes we get off course and end up with a life that feels
draining. We can feel hobbled and paralyzed, unable to detect the call of
our great life. So we resort to what is comfy &amp; familiar -- to-do lists,
old habits, busyness and distractions.</p>
<p>We all arrive on this planet with possibility &amp;
potential and with a desire to live a great life.</p>
<p>With all the demands we have on us and with all the balls we
juggle, our vision for our lives can get off-course and maybe even end up
completely in the ditch.</p>
<p>In order to live the lives we want to live, we must carve
out time and space to design them the way we want them to be. We must
understand how to use and implement tools for authentic change. We must offer
ourselves and our lives both love and attention. This is what the Art and

<h3>Story of My Book</h3>
<p><i>Pity Partiers</i> is a guide to teach you how to overcome and celebrate failure by using the pity party method. Failure is to be chased and not avoided as it is the route to success. Be a pity partier and celebrate failure!<br/><br/>My name is Daniela Carrasco, and I am the author of <i>Pity Partiers</i>. I wrote this book because we live in a world that does not fully embrace failures. Everyone shows off their success, but very rarely you are demonstrated the lows that were experienced to get to the top of the mountain. I want to help people stop viewing failure as a defeat and start celebrating it. I believe failures are stepping stones to launching success. Stop allowing failure to hold you back. I have experienced a bucketful of failures throughout my life and career, and I am commonly asked how I am able to stay positive and resilient. I do so with my secret sauce, pity parties! Pity Partiers are created when using my three-step pity party method that has helped me overcome failure throughout my life.<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover that failures are nothing to fear. I hope you actually start chasing them even more. In this book, I hope to instill the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for failure in you. And then ultimately I want you to see this book as a tool to help you to overcome any obstacle or curveball by becoming an effective pity partier. This book is like a best friend who cheers you on from the sidelines.<br/><br/>In this book, you'll learn about failure and how to use the pity party method to overcome failure:</p>
<ul>
<li>How failure affects our brain, and the reason why people fear it.</li>
<li>The creation of the pity party method, and the three parties you can throw yourself to overcome failure.</li>

Pity Partiers is a guide to teach you how to overcome and celebrate failure by using the pity party method. Failure is to be chased and not avoided as it is the route to success. Be a pity partier and celebrate failure!My name is Daniela Carrasco, and I am the author of Pity Partiers. I wrote this book because we live in a world that does not fully embrace failures. Everyone shows off their success, but very rarely you are demonstrated the lows that were experienced to get to the top of the mountain. I want to help people stop viewing failure as a defeat and start celebrating it. I believe failures are stepping stones to launching success. Stop allowing failure to hold you back. I have experienced a bucketful of failures throughout my life and career, and I am commonly asked how I am able to stay positive and resilient. I do so with my secret sauce, pity parties! Pity Partiers are created when using my three-step pity party method that has helped me overcome failure throughout my life.My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover that failures are nothing to fear. I hope you actually start chasing them even more. In this book, I hope to instill the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for failure in you. And then ultimately I want you to see this book as a tool to help you to overcome any obstacle or curveball by becoming an effective pity partier. This book is like a best friend who cheers you on from the sidelines.In this book, you'll learn about failure and how to use the pity party method to overcome failure:

How failure affects our brain, and the reason why people fear it.
The creation of the pity party method, and the three parties you can throw yourself to overcome failure.
The principals of an effective pity partier.

<p>Since
the successful international release of The Spanish Helmet, I have had many
requests for a German edition. It makes sense, a Swiss/New Zealand author should have their
work available in German too. Especially when parts of the novel take place in
ZÃ¼rich. Therefore, I have decided to take a risk and conduct an experiment in
self-publishing that I havenâ€™t seen undertaken elsewhere. I have launched a
translation project with a qualified and experienced translator and am funding
the task myself. The contract is already signed and the work is underway but my
translator is working for peanuts. So that she (an expecting mother) can afford to stock up on gherkins   and chocolate, we need your help.<br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Indie authors (self-publishers) have a tough time breaking into the market. It's a shame, because there is some great work out there. If we can successfully launch this translation into the German market, we can illuminate another possibility for indie authors to spread their work. A success in this experiment could also lead to a large increase in self-published works becoming available in the German market, something that German readers will be very happy to see.<br/></p>
<p>I will provide reports on the experiment outcomes to any supporters who would like them.</p>
<p></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The
translation is being done at an extremely low rate of approximately $4000.
But this isnâ€™t nearly enough income for the three months of work involved. Any
over-funding of this project will go to the hands of my translator who plays a
huge role in the task of getting The Spanish Helmet (Der Spanische Helm) out to you in German. Any
amount under the agreed $4000 will be paid out of my pocket or through other
funding sources if I can find them.</p>
<p>I hope that some of the gifts I propose will provoke you to
support this literature experiment. If you have other ideas or gift
suggestions, please donâ€™t hesitate to make a proposal.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>You can help by spreading the word to other indie authors, German readers, Swiss/NZ literature fans and anyone else who wants to get a copy of the The Spanish Helmet in either English or German and support a good cause/experiment at the same time.</p>
<p>Any
agents or publishers interested in securing rights to the successful English or
future German edition of The Spanish Helmet should contact me.</p>
<h3>The Book</h3>
<div>A phone call between two friends unleashes a series of events  which threaten to shatter New Zealand's officially accepted history.<br/><br/>Dr. Matthew Cameron travels to New Zealand to investigate a remarkable archaeological discovery. As he follows a trail of clues scattered throughout the country, Matt is thrust into the role of student and learns about trust, love and deception. But can he succeed in revising a nation's history when the Government will stop at nothing to hide the truth?
<br/><br/>Five centuries earlier, Francisco de Hoces is lost in the Pacific Ocean after his ship is separated from the rest of his fleet. Fate shipwrecks the San Lesmes on beautiful and mysterious shores. Can he and his crew survive amongst the natives in this extraordinary land? <br/><br/>The Spanish Helmet weaves together the stories of two men whose destinies are set to collide.

zeigen, dass es auch fÃ¼r unabhÃ¤ngige fremdsprachige Autoren mÃ¶glich ist, ihre

das gelingt, sind dem potenziellen Wachstum der Indie-Literatur in deutscher
Sprache praktisch keine Grenzen mehr gesetzt.</p>
<p>Ich habe das Projektziel mit $4000 bewusst sehr niedrig angesetzt. DafÃ¼r kann man natÃ¼rlich kein Buch Ã¼bersetzen
lassen. Die Ãœbersetzung wird zu den immer noch extrem niedrigen Kosten von $4000 durchgefÃ¼hrt, was fÃ¼r die etwa dreimonatige Arbeit kaum ein
ausreichendes Einkommen ist. Sollten wir fÃ¼r das Projekt eine hÃ¶here
Finanzierung bekommen, geht das Geld ausnahmslos an meine Ãœbersetzerin, die
eine wesentliche Rolle dabei spielt, den Roman Der Spanische Helm fÃ¼r
deutschsprachige Leser zur VerfÃ¼gung zu stellen. Andernfalls werde ich die auf
$4000 fehlende Summe aus eigener Tasche bezahlen, oder durch andere Quellen
finanzieren, falls sich solche finden lassen.</p>

miteinander verknÃ¼pft sind. Als ihre Welten schlieÃŸlich aufeinanderprallen,
sollen die Auswirkungen dieser Explosion die Geschichte Neuseelands fÃ¼r immer
verÃ¤ndern.
Greg
Scowens Erstlingsroman, der von einer spannenden Handlung vorangetrieben wird,
erzÃ¤hlt von einer modernen Schatzsuche und ist zugleich ein akribisch
recherchierter VerschwÃ¶rungsthriller, der Fakten und Fiktion gekonnt
miteinander verbindet.
Experiment
Mit diesem Experiment kÃ¶nnen wir gemeinsam
erstmals in der Geschichte des Verlagswesens einen PrÃ¤zedenzfall schaffen und
zeigen, dass es auch fÃ¼r unabhÃ¤ngige fremdsprachige Autoren mÃ¶glich ist, ihre
eigenen BÃ¼cher fÃ¼r deutschsprachige Leser auf den Markt zu bringen. Wenn uns
das gelingt, sind dem potenziellen Wachstum der Indie-Literatur in deutscher
Sprache praktisch keine Grenzen mehr gesetzt.
Ich habe das Projektziel mit $4000 bewusst sehr niedrig angesetzt. DafÃ¼r kann man natÃ¼rlich kein Buch Ã¼bersetzen
lassen. Die Ãœbersetzung wird zu den immer noch extrem niedrigen Kosten von $4000 durchgefÃ¼hrt, was fÃ¼r die etwa dreimonatige Arbeit kaum ein
ausreichendes Einkommen ist. Sollten wir fÃ¼r das Projekt eine hÃ¶here
Finanzierung bekommen, geht das Geld ausnahmslos an meine Ãœbersetzerin, die
eine wesentliche Rolle dabei spielt, den Roman Der Spanische Helm fÃ¼r
deutschsprachige Leser zur VerfÃ¼gung zu stellen. Andernfalls werde ich die auf
$4000 fehlende Summe aus eigener Tasche bezahlen, oder durch andere Quellen
finanzieren, falls sich solche finden lassen.
Ich hoffe, dass die zur Auswahl stehenden Goodies
viele Menschen dazu bewegen werden, dieses schweizerische Literaturexperiment
zu unterstÃ¼tzen. Wer andere VorschlÃ¤ge oder WÃ¼nsche hat, kann sich jederzeit an
mich wenden.
Literaturagenten oder Verleger, die
Interesse daran haben, sich die Rechte fÃ¼r die erfolgreiche englischsprachige
Version oder die kommende deutschsprachige Version von Der Spanische Helm zu
sichern, kÃ¶nnen mich ebenfalls gerne kontaktieren.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>¿Qué?</h3>
<p><strong>La casa del ajo</strong> es una novela de misterio acerca de ese <i>muerto en el armario</i> que hay en toda familia.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">El descubrimiento de un hombre corrupto sobre el hecho de haber concebido una hija de forma violenta, le hace pensar en la necesidad de deshacerse de ella para no ser juzgado por la sociedad y despojado de la comodidad y bienestar obtenido. Llevar a fin esa idea desencadena una serie de fenómenos paranormales en el bosque, hasta entonces tranquilo, que cambia la vida de todas las personas de Piket Cross durante generaciones.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Sarah Fisher, una descendiente, embarazada y en compañía de su marido y de un hijo de nueve años, que emigrará a América huyendo del periodo de post guerra tras la guerra civil española, pasa a recibir como herencia antes del viaje la granja de su abuela en Piket Cross y una carta perteneciente al tío abuelo Ernes. La carta del tío abuelo Ernes que María Aurora (la madre de Sarah) tenía guardada y que le da en la cama de un hospital en España, ya que no le queda tiempo para explicar todo antes de morir, es el principio que lleva a Sarah a conocer la historia secreta de la familia y el misterio en torno a esos fenómenos paranormales regalándole una vida inimaginable, impensable, más allá de la granja, del pueblo y del bosque.</p>

<h3>Who we are</h3>
<p>Hello all, </p>
<p>We are Dennis &amp; Maryann Burns. We have been a team going on thirty years. For almost twenty of those years we worked side by side in my families book store. We are proud to say we love books! We loved selling them and having our customers tell us that we were dead on in a recommendation or way off! We love reading them and the way a good book makes you feel or that sad feeling when you finish reading it and think, ""That book ended way to soon!"" We instilled that love in our now grown children.</p>
<p>In June of this year along with our children we opened a publishing company, to bring quality books at great prices to the public and to help any aspiring authors do the same. We invested all of our money to fund the company and our cost projections showed we had enough to carry us through December. We published 2 small non-fiction e-books and we were off. You can see our site here: <a href=""http://burnsclanmedia.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" title=""Company web site"">Burns Clan Media Company</a></p>
<p>We were on track to release our first book in a series titled, <strong>THE NEXT PLANET OVER</strong> a science fiction story about what happens if our planet can no longer sustain us. <strong>Where will we go? How will we get there? What will we do with the remaining time on our planet? </strong>See more info on both our web-site and the Facebook page below. Our marketing plan was to release this in conjunction with NASA's Curiosity Rover landing on Mars. We had hoped to receive a hugh publicity boost from that. Then follow up with the second book in the series in time for the holiday shopping season. Well, the best laid plans as they say...</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Why we are asking for your help</h3>
<p>In early August my mom had a serious medical problem hit her. This caused us to postpone the launch of the book for what we thought would be about two to three weeks while we helped her recover. That turned into a much longer time period. Just as we were rounding the bend on my moms recovery, we were hit by a tragic loss on my wife's side of the family, which we are still trying to come to grips with. We now find ourselves in the beginning of October, way behind schedule and our funds have dwindled drastically. We are hoping with your support we can get back on target.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What we need the funds for</h3>
<p>We are asking for your help and support so that we may restore some of our funds and stay afloat through December.</p>
<p>Our first two non-fiction books are still finding there footing in the market place.They are not providing enough sales volume yet to offset our costs.</p>
<p>The first book in the series is ninety percent done. With some round the clock work days this week we should be able to finish final edits and proof reading, fingers crossed. The print on demand paperback version should follow.</p>
<p>Based on the limited test marketing we did, on the first book in THE NEXT PLANET OVER series, we should see a tremendous response. If we are able to work full time on the second book in the series, we will be able to get it launched in time for the all important holiday shopping season. The sales from both these books should cover our costs.</p>
<p>Your support will go toward helping us restore our funds and help pay for maintaining our web-site, hiring an editor, proofreader and book cover designer for the second book in the series. Limited print type advertising on-line. The biggest expense wil be starting and maintaining a rather large social media blitz which we have set up on most of the platforms, Twitter, Facebook, Pinterest, Google+, Linkedn, Goodreads ect.</p>

<h3><strong style=""font-size: 1.5em;"">Project Description</strong></h3>
Canadian Journalists for Free Expression (CJFE) is a non governmental organization which monitors, defends and reports on free expression and access to information in Canada and abroad. Rooted in the field of journalism, we promote a free media as essential to a fair and open society.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>For the past three years CJFE has published <em>The Free Expression Review</em>, an in-depth analysis of the state of free expression in Canada. It features a report card grading, on an A-to-F scale, of how institutions, governmental departments and public figures have affected freedom of expression and access to information over the past year.  We search out some of the leaders in this field to write insightful pieces about court cases, trends and how these issues affect Canadians. It is the only publication of this kind produced in Canada and has won acclaim for its quality and its coverage. It is distributed online and in hard copy on World Press Freedom Day (May 3).</div>

<h3><span style=""font-size: 1.17em;"">The Impact</span></h3>
</div>
<div>
<p>Although we live in a democracy which is known for its protection and encouragement of human rights in Canada and around the world, when it comes to free expression – one of the most fundamental of human rights – Canada, once a world leader, is falling behind. <em>The Free Expression Review</em> is an important publication which informs all Canadians about what is happening with this fundamental right.</p>
<h3><strong>How can you contribute?</strong></h3>
<p>1)      <strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Donate</span></strong>! The Review informs Canadians about how their right to free expression is faring in this country and by engaging them with the critical issues – this is your chance to make sure that happens. It is a big job, and every dollar goes a long way.</p>
<p>2)      <strong>Tell others</strong>! Crowdfunding isn’t based on large donations, but a LOT of donations. Everyone you can pass this on to is one more person who knows about their right to free expression, CJFE’s work, and the importance of holding those in authority accountable.</p>
<h3><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Did you know that: </span></strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Canada</strong> was ranked 55<sup>th</sup> this year, in an international assessment of countries’ Right to Information legislation. </li>
<li>
<strong>Canada’s</strong> scientists who work for the Federal government are being muzzled. Despite the importance of research in crucial scientific areas such as climate change, water and air quality and food inspection, the Canadian Government has placed increasing restrictions on the ability of scientists to speak to the media and the Canadian public. </li>
<li>
<strong>Canada’s </strong>laws are slowly recognizing the important role that whistleblowers play in ensuring accountability of corporations and the state, but in practice, many whistleblowers have been vilified, been fired from their jobs, and years later are still fighting lengthy court battles.</li>
<li>
<strong>Canada</strong> treats defamation as a criminal offence in contravention of international human rights standards.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>The Free Expression Review</em> helps all Canadians have a clear understanding of their right to free expression and access to information.  We believe that if you take this fundamental right for granted it will slowly erode away.  Canadians don’t spend much time thinking about this right, but it is a right that it is essential in protecting other rights such as the right to shelter and food, clean water and air, access to health care and education.  If you don’t have the information about these rights or the ability to communicate about them, they too will be threatened.</p>
<h3><strong>What we need funding for:</strong></h3>
<p>This year, our goal is to expand our coverage of issues in every province and territory, and build our team of staff and volunteers to ensure that we are able to respond to these issues throughout the year.  Here is how the money will be spent:</p>
<ul>
<li>Compensation for key people producing <em>The Review</em> including: the Art Director, Managing Editor and Copy editor</li>
<li>Distribution of <em>The Review</em> to journalism and communication programs at universities and colleges across the country</li>
<li>Targeted follow up with relevant authorities on the critical issues addressed, including interventions,</li>
<li>Further research on these critical issues to follow them as they progress throughout the year</li>
<li>Hold a public launch event on May 2, which will be live blogged and feature well-known thinkers speaking about free expression.  More details to be announced.  Stay tuned.</li>
</ul>
<h3> <strong>Three reasons why you should donate:</strong>
</h3>
<ol start=""1"">
<li>
<em>The Review</em> is a key tool in measuring our right to free expression in Canada. We need your help to make sure it reaches as many people as possible</li>
<li>We know what we’re doing. Building on past reviews the amount of experience, energy, and expertise we put into this effort results in an amazing and accessible product for Canadians.</li>
<li>Free expression matters. If we take this fundamental right for granted, it will erode. CJFE’s  job is to monitor the state of free expression in Canada and report back to the public on what we need pay attention to.  </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> We receive much-appreciated pro bono support for the printing of the Review, public relations and some graphic design work. (Thank you to <em>The Globe and Mail</em>, Media Profile and Juniper Park). We also work with a committee of volunteers who research and write articles for us pro bono. </p>
<p><strong>Our Goal for Indiegogo: $5,000</strong></p>
<p>This amount will help us to cover the hard costs for this year’s Review and to make sure that we can tell as many people about it as possible.</p>
<p><strong>Stretch Goals: If we made it to $10,000</strong></p>
<p>We rely on volunteers to do a vast amount of research, writing and fact-checking.  In the future, we’d love to recognise the valuable contributions by these many hard-working writers and editorial contributors with moderate honorariums. </p>
<p><strong>If we made it to $25,000</strong></p>
<p>It’s a big if, but we would love to hire our wonderful part-time Web and Social Media Editor to work full-time so that we can spend more time writing and encouraging Canadians to talk about these issues all year-long.  We would also spend some of the money on doing more in-depth research on key free of expression issues such as how all governments in Canada –federal, provincial and municipal—are providing access to information for journalists and individual Canadians.</p>

The Review is a key tool in measuring our right to free expression in Canada. We need your help to make sure it reaches as many people as possible
We know what we’re doing. Building on past reviews the amount of experience, energy, and expertise we put into this effort results in an amazing and accessible product for Canadians.
Free expression matters. If we take this fundamental right for granted, it will erode. CJFE’s  job is to monitor the state of free expression in Canada and report back to the public on what we need pay attention to.  

Note: We receive much-appreciated pro bono support for the printing of the Review, public relations and some graphic design work. (Thank you to The Globe and Mail, Media Profile and Juniper Park). We also work with a committee of volunteers who research and write articles for us pro bono. 
Our Goal for Indiegogo: $5,000
This amount will help us to cover the hard costs for this year’s Review and to make sure that we can tell as many people about it as possible.
Stretch Goals: If we made it to $10,000
We rely on volunteers to do a vast amount of research, writing and fact-checking.  In the future, we’d love to recognise the valuable contributions by these many hard-working writers and editorial contributors with moderate honorariums. 
If we made it to $25,000
It’s a big if, but we would love to hire our wonderful part-time Web and Social Media Editor to work full-time so that we can spend more time writing and encouraging Canadians to talk about these issues all year-long.  We would also spend some of the money on doing more in-depth research on key free of expression issues such as how all governments in Canada –federal, provincial and municipal—are providing access to information for journalists and individual Canadians.
Sample Articles from the 2012 Edition
Silenced Scientists
Federal communications policy bars scientists from talking to the media about their research, making it much more difficult to share key findings with the public.
Is the Canadian government freezing out civil society?
Is the Canadian government deliberately withholding funds from dissenting civil society organizations? Maybe, maybe not. But even the perception places a chill on free expression.
Delay, Redact, Refuse, Repeat
Governments continue to give journalists and other information requestors the runaround.

(English version below)
La
hermana Olga Ruiz, costarricense y misionera Comboniana, trabajó 12 años como
enfermera en Teticha, Etiopía.  Ella es testigo de las innumerables
situaciones de necesidad en el campo de la salud, principalmente en el
área de la niñez.  
En enero
regresa a trabajar a este país con un solo fin en mente: construir una consulta
de puericultura* para luchar contra las altas tasas de mortalidad infantil del
lugar.
Con este
proyecto recaudaremos los fondos para que esta consulta sea un motor de vida y
esperanza para miles de niños del lugar y sus alrededores. 

 Lo que necesitamos y lo que obtenés
 

Necesitamos
     $20.000 para todo el material y mano de obra que conlleva construir esta
     consulta y adquirir el equipo médico necesario.
Como
     te contábamos la hermana Olga ya ha trabajado anteriormente en este lugar,
     este proyecto se insertará dentro de la Clínica de Teticha con la tribu
     Sidamo, cerca de Hawassa. Lugar en el que ella ya trabajó y a dónde volverá a
     inicios del 2015.  Esto es de gran ventaja porque ya se cuenta con el
     lugar y el respaldo para iniciar esta conusulta. Ahora sólo falta nuestro aporte.


""Teniendo la experiencia de ser enferma en Etiopía y Sur Sudán , sentí la necesidad de actualizarme para poder dar un servicio más efectivo.  Así que estoy haciendo una maestría en la Universidad de Costa Rica y mi proyecto de graduación es un modelo de consulta que atienda la necesidad tan grande que enfrenta la niñez en África, específicamente en la zona de Teticha, Etiopía"". Hermana Olga

Sabías que:


Se
     estima que 200 millones de niños y niñas en países en desarrollo no llegan
     a alcanzar su máximo potencial.  De esos niños, 89 millones
     habitan en diez países, entre ellos se encuentra Etiopía (Series
     Lancet, 2007).
En
     el África Subsahariana más de 12.000 niños de 0 a 5 años mueren todos los
     días por causas prevenibles o que son tratables. Etiopía es parte de
     esta zona de África. La muerte es causada especialmente por
     desnutrición, enfermedades infecciosas y causas neonatales (Series
     Lancet, 2007). 
De
     acuerdo a la Organización Mundial de la Salud, Etiopía se encuentra entre
     los 10 países que tienen mayor índice de mortalidad infantil.

<h3>Praise for Russell Rowland</h3>
<p>This heartfelt exploration of the lives and hard times of a prairie ranch family fairly pulses with the intrigues of existence. Russell Rowland has given us a vivid and distinctive piece of homespun to take its proper place in the literary quilt of the West.</p>
<p>Ivan Doig, National Book Award winner, <i>This House of Sky</i></p>
<p><i>Fifty-Six Counties</i>, a book I read with pleasure and admiration, is a great companion for those who already love Montana and for those anxious to get a real sense of the place without the salesmanship.""</p>
<p> --  Tom McGuane, author of <i>The Cadence of Grass</i> and <i>Gallatin Canyon</i></p>
<p>Russell Rowland is fiercely devoted to the atonement and beauty that are the hallmarks of all great works of art.  Rowland names our collective loneliness, but does so with a fierce and tender devotion to the mothers and fathers of all races, all cultures.  <em>Fifty-Six Counties</em> is animated by the numinous even as it humbles us, makes us more sane, and draws us into a new and invigorating experience of the essence of life. This is a book for Montana, for the nation, and for the world."" </p>
<p>-- Shann Ray, Author of <em>American Masculine, Balefire,</em> and <em>American Copper</em></p>
<p>I can’t wait for others to discover this book. Thoughtful, wise, funny, sincere, and <i>deep</i>: those are the words that come to mind when reading this treasure. Rowland is a humble observer, but he’s also willing to dig deep and bravely, offering astute reflections on the state, its resources, its peoples, its history, and its charm and its dangers. In a voice all his own, Rowland proves to be warm and personable, and yet cutting and real—basically, one couldn’t wish for a better guide to the state of Montana. This book is utterly unique. A gorgeous accomplishment.</p>
<p>-- Laura Pritchett, author of <i>Stars Go Blue</i></p>
<p>Everything about Montana is big: its proverbial sky, its mountains, its wide open spaces. And yet, Russell Rowland has managed to capture all that grand landscape--and the people who inhabit it--into the intimacy of a single book. Fifty-Six Counties is a remarkable book: a macro-focused narrative using a wide-angle lens. If you have room for only one book about Montana on your shelf, make it this one.</p>

<h3>Arbuckle and The Difference Between Us</h3>
<p>When you find yourself in the position of having many wonderful friends, including writers you greatly admire, tell you that the work you’re doing is important (and even good!), but every overture you make toward agents and major publishers is met with a solid chorus of cricket noises, you basically have three choices:</p>
<ol>
<li>Whine incessantly to your friends about the publishing business and how unfairly you are being treated.</li>
<li>Spend way too many hours obsessing about writers who are simply not very good but who have made a fortune from their books.</li>
<li>Somehow find a way to take control of your own career trajectory.</li>
</ol>
<p> </p>
<p>Monty, is it possible to pick all three doors, you may ask? Yes, it is. But I’m going to break out of the first two and focus on number three. So I have two finished novels, and because I have kind, generous, talented friends in the world of ‘small’ publishing, I have some options to help me get them out into the world. The problem is that I will need to help with design and production costs. So…I have created this Indigogo fund to help pay for those costs. This is essentially preselling my books, because if you donate, you will receive signed copies of several of my books. I’m offering a few different packages.</p>
<p>The first of the new novels is called <i>Arbuckle</i>, and it’s the prequel to <i>In Open Spaces</i>, so it forms the third leg of the trilogy of the Arbuckle family, with the sequel being <i>The Watershed Years</i>. Arbuckle is the story of the meeting and early years of the marriage between George Arbuckle, a wagon boss for a big cattle outfit, and Catherine Boland, the first woman to own a business in Belle Fourche, South Dakota. An early tragedy in their marriage puts a strain on their relationship, especially when Catherine decides to make the incident public, against George's wishes. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The second novel, <i>The Difference Between Us</i>, is the story of a murder that takes place in a small ranching community. A new family moves into the community, and on their first day of school, the young boy from this family gets into a fight with another boy, hitting him with a bat. That evening, Tom Butcher, a powerful but controversial rancher in the region, stops by the new family's house to warn the father about making a bad first impression. Later that evening, Tom is murdered, beaten to death by a baseball bat, which immediately draws suspicion on thenew man. But as the events unfold, we learn that many people in the community had reason to want Tom Butcher dead, and there is another twist, in that during the course of the investigation, sheriffs realize that Tom was actually a cross-dresser.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What Russell Needs &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>As an incentive to contribute to this campaign, you will be receiving signed copies of Russell's books. There are several options. </p>
<ul>
<li>Russell needs to raise at least $5000 to help finance the development and production of these novels, as well as the promotion.</li>
<li>Your contribution will net you signed copies of one or more of Russell's books, shipped directly to you.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>If Russell is able to meet this goal, he hopes to release both <i>Arbuckle </i>and<i> The Difference Between Us </i>in the next year. It's been two years since Russell had a new book published, so his fans are eager to see something new. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>If Russell does not reach his goal, he will still find a way to get these books published, so you will still receive your reward. It will probably just take longer. But for Russell's last book, <i>Fifty-Six Counties</i>, a Kickstarter campaign raised $7000, so it's likely he will reach his goal and you'll be able to receive your copies of his books in the next year. </p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Please pass along this information to friends of yours who are avid readers, especially fans of Montana literature. Russell could use all the help he can get. </p>

<h3>Great Science Fiction seeking wider audience</h3>
<p>My name is Michael Brachman and I am a science fiction writer. My books are doing well but I get a lot of requests for the books in audio book format. I have contracted with a professional recording studio to record my first novel, <em>Rome's Revolution</em>, as an audio book but unfortunately they want to be paid to do this.</p>
<p>In the modern world, people are so busy that they don't have time to just sit and relax and read a really exciting, robust novel for hours at a time. They want to have the book loaded on their iPhone or iPad or on CDs so they can listen while they drive or work. When recorded, the 167,000 word novel <em>Rome's Revolution</em> will take about 18 hours to enjoy. </p>
<p>Here is a synopsis of the book:</p>
<p><em>Rome's Revolution</em> chronicles the adventures of Rei Bierak, a 
twenty-something male from the very near future. Rei, along with 542 
other humans, is frozen and launched in the Ark II toward the stars with
 the hope of establishing a colony on a habitable world in the Tau Ceti 
system.  During Rei's long trip, modern civilization has collapsed, and 
society has reformed into a decidedly different model.  The 
24-chromosome mind-connected humans of the future called the Vuduri are 
efficient, indifferent, and emotionally deficient. The Vuduri have 
conquered faster-than-light travel and have established an outpost in 
the Pi3 Orionis system (aka Tabit) to study why certain stars are 
disappearing. Awakening 1388 years in the future, Rei meets Rome, a 
beautiful half-breed Vuduri woman, who is eventually ostracized for 
consorting with him. Rei and Rome are joined by OMCOM, a super-computer 
with delusions of omnipotence. Together, they fend off a hostile 
society, saboteurs, and technology indistinguishable from magic.  The 
fate of humanity, perhaps even life itself, hangs in the balance.</p>
<p>Sound exciting? Interesting? You can read more about it at the <a href=""http://www.RomesRevolution.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Rome's Revolution Website</a>. Would you like to listen to this as an audio book? Well here is your chance to help. </p>
<strong><p></p>
<h3>What's it going to take to get this done?</h3></strong><p>The studio wants $3600 to professionally record and produce the novel as an audio book. They will be using a professional voice artist. It will take an additional $1000 or so to get a cover made, CDs stamped and market the book. After accounting for the fees it takes to fund this drive and the cost of the perks, it comes to about $5000.</p>
<p>Some of the perks being offered are truly unique. For example, you can get personally signed copies of the entire <em>Rome's Revolution </em>trilogy. One perk lets you name a character, describe their characteristics and they will be integrated in the upcoming novel <em>The Vuduri</em> <em>Knight</em> which will be released late this year.</p>
<p>I am committed to doing this so any funds raised will be used to help defray the costs. Whether I reach my goal or not, the money will go to the studio and production costs.</p>
<p></p>

<p>Even if you can’t contribute, you can still help by sharing news about this campaign with your friends and family.  If you are electronic in nature, that means Twitter, Facebook, Instagram even email.

<p>Perhaps you have already experienced how really enjoyable knowing God can be, and your life has been forever changed by the love of Jesus.  Whether you have questions about God, and would like to see if there is journey to discover in Him that you have never imagined, or you have come into a place of intimacy and you would like to see if there is a way to go even deeper, my hope is the <i>Formed in Secret</i> would stir something in you that inspires you to find out who God really is for you.  </p>
<p><br/></p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>At this point I am under contract with a great Christian publisher called Creation House.  We are into the editing process and developing my original manuscript into a publishable format.  </p>
<p>I have already raised the money needed for the original deposit with the publisher through more grass-roots, person-to-person fund raising, but still need funds to complete this project.  I am looking for help from people who feel this book might be helpful to them on their personal journey, and from people who are passionate about who God is in their lives, and feel that this book can help people discover a path to greater depths in Jesus.  </p>
<p>Even if we do not reach the goal of $6,000.00, which will cover the remainder of the contract cost and shipping costs for the book, whatever money we do raise will go toward the cost of this book's publication and distribution.  And for anyone who contributes a minimum of $15.00 to this work we will send you a copy of the book once it's finished.      </p>

<p>There is no “formula” to successful Christian living. But one trait
stands out among those who are accessing the grace to engage God's
promises as a daily reality: identity. Who He is, and who He created each of
us to be. Sean Harvey understands this as one who truly has been formed in
secret. In this timely book, he shares many Biblical truths that spring to life
when described by a man clearly overtaken by the love and affection of his
Heavenly Father through all of life's circumstances. Every time I read, I am more
encouraged in my understanding of God’s sovereign plan, and my created
value. You will be too!</p>

that have been held captive.  Sean’s
story will inspire you to live a life surrendered to the Lover of your soul and
will ignite your heart to be consumed by the only relationship that can unlock
your God-given identity. </p>

   What We Need & What You Get At this point I am under contract with a great Christian publisher called Creation House.  We are into the editing process and developing my original manuscript into a publishable format.  
I have already raised the money needed for the original deposit with the publisher through more grass-roots, person-to-person fund raising, but still need funds to complete this project.  I am looking for help from people who feel this book might be helpful to them on their personal journey, and from people who are passionate about who God is in their lives, and feel that this book can help people discover a path to greater depths in Jesus.  
Even if we do not reach the goal of $6,000.00, which will cover the remainder of the contract cost and shipping costs for the book, whatever money we do raise will go toward the cost of this book's publication and distribution.  And for anyone who contributes a minimum of $15.00 to this work we will send you a copy of the book once it's finished.      

    The Impact I think the best way to share the impact I believe my book can have is for you to read some endorsements from people who have already had a chance to read it:


There is no “formula” to successful Christian living. But one trait
stands out among those who are accessing the grace to engage God's
promises as a daily reality: identity. Who He is, and who He created each of
us to be. Sean Harvey understands this as one who truly has been formed in
secret. In this timely book, he shares many Biblical truths that spring to life
when described by a man clearly overtaken by the love and affection of his
Heavenly Father through all of life's circumstances. Every time I read, I am more
encouraged in my understanding of God’s sovereign plan, and my created
value. You will be too!
Mike
Massé
Pastor
and author of #iamholy

Formed in Secret
will take you on a journey of spiritual transformation as you experience the
passion and transparency of Sean’s walk with the Lord.  It will challenge you to think outside of the
box called religion and cause you to dig deeper into the areas of your life
that have been held captive.  Sean’s
story will inspire you to live a life surrendered to the Lover of your soul and
will ignite your heart to be consumed by the only relationship that can unlock
your God-given identity.

    Other Ways You Can Help
If you don't feel you can help with this project, or simply don't have the money to contribute, we would very much appreciate anyone who is willing to share this and get the word out in any way you can.  
We also covet your prayers, and any words of encouragement, as this work comes to completion and my wife and I tackle the task, along with the publisher, of marketing this book. 
Thanks again for checking out our story!  God bless.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
In October 2012, I became unemployed. As terrifying as that was, I realized that it was an opportunity to change my life for the better. My last few jobs left me feeling empty and miserable, and I always knew there was more out there for me. As a writer and a voracious reader, I dreamed of getting into the publishing business. Call it luck, call it fate, call it perfect timing or whatever you choose... but a friend who owned a small press was looking to move on to other adventures in her own life. She approached me with an idea. And here I am, taking over a small press with a good reputation that I have much bigger plans for in the future. This is my dream. Help me achieve it and forever change my life.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>While the company is established and comes with a great catalog already, there are a few start-up costs that I have to absorb. Being unemployed, this is going to be a challenge for me, to say the least. I have a fixed income that doesn't give me much wiggle room for extras. I'm not one to give up though and hope that starting this company will help me achieve greater financial success. I have no doubt it will be self-sustaining in the near future, I just have to get over this initial hurdle.</p>
<p>Some of these start-up costs include purchasing ISBN numbers, the cost of printing new books, the cost of setting up the business itself as well as necessary supplies/programs to start off strong.</p>
<p>ISBNs come in bundles of 10 for $250, or bundles of 100 for $575. Currently, I am looking to start off with the bundle of 10 and growing from there, but if I raise enough, it would be worth it to start off with a larger bundle. They are more affordable per ISBN and would save me money in the long term. </p>
<p>I'm also looking at purchasing an affordable refurbished desktop PC to replace my worn out seven year old Mac laptop. This helps me be more efficient with my day-to-day business activities. I have some of the programs needed to work on cover art and so forth, but they are all for PC and will not work on my Mac. Others I may need to purchase if I am able to.  I've already priced refurbished PCs and believe this should cost me no more than $200-300. I'm a frugal girl by nature and have looked around to find the best deals possible. I will not be looking to buy top-of-the-line anything, just a standard desktop PC to help me conduct my business with ease.</p>
<p>In addition, I'd like to raise funds to get started on the cover designs, editing and marketing of the first two books I will be releasing. This will ensure that I hit the ground running and produce products that maintain Fey's dedication to quality books.</p>
<h3>Anthologies</h3>
<p>I've already started accepting submissions for two anthologies listed <a href=""http://www.feypublishing.com/submissions"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here.</a> Fey Publishing will always look to promote nontraditional heroes, and we are a LGBT friendly publishing company. We look to publish books that include characters that are LGBT. We also want to promote strong female characters and will always look for books/short stories that include them. This is a something I'm very passionate about. </p>
<p>If I surpass my goal, I can pay cover artists to design these covers as well as pay authors a small payment to be included within the books. </p>
<h3>
<br/>$1 E-Book Promotion!</h3>

In ""Tending the Flock,"" you will see the lengths that faith and devotion will drive a man to.

<p><strong><em>Shattered Honor </em></strong>is a dark psychological thriller. Danny Perkins returns home from Afghanistan, a broken man scarred by the horrors of war in the grips of a deep depression and dark, violent urges. He is haunted by the memories of the thing he witnessed and the things he was forced to do in the name of country and duty. As he struggles to piece his life and his fraying relationship with his girlfriend Shannon back together, he is inevitably drawn toward a dark path in which he must confront his past to reclaim his life and his future.</p>
<p>I'm also offering up my own writing. I will offer up a PDF version of my shorts, which are a variety of stories already written. There is everything from gritty horror to cutesy fairy tales and everything in between. I primarily write dark speculative fiction that features strong female characters in the starring role.

She's also kindly offered to write a personalzed story for someone that will be included in her upcoming book. Her next book will showcase historic photos of Toronto and tell fictional stories about each one. I've read some of the pieces going into it and it's going to be a great book.</p>
<h3>Alternate Plans</h3>
<p>If I don't reach full funding by the end of the campaign, the company is still going to move forward as planned. I will focus my attention on acquiring ISBNs and printing costs first and foremost. Beyond that, the additional money will be used to hire both an editor and an artist to help present a professional quality book.</p>
<p>There are also fees that Indiegogo takes out that I'm also looking to cover in the amount requested.</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>I'm a very strong willed and ambitious woman. When I put my mind to something, I find ways to make it happen. I grew up in poverty and still fought my way through college and graduate school, against all odds and working my butt off to pay for it. When I decided I wanted to move across the country to California, I made it happen within two weeks and all by myself. I've always dreamed of owning my own publishing company, and I am making that happen right now. I am forging a new life for myself, one step at a time. I don't have to just live life on fast forward, wishing away my days because I hate what I do. I want to love what I do. I love books. I love writing. And I love promoting people and helping them succeed. The idea of finding new talent and helping launch their careers is something that brings me immense joy.</p>
<p>That's the thing with Fey, I don't plan on making it benefit just me. I want to find new talent, writers that haven't been published before but who have the skill to create something beautiful.  I'm not looking to stick with the mainstream, I want to find new voices and fresh stories that the world can appreciate. I want to help the writers I work with and help build their careers up so they also can one day enjoy doing what they love most and getting paid for it as well.</p>
<p>After all, life is too short to constantly be wasting the days we have, wishing for Friday. We should all be so lucky as to do something that makes us happy and fulfilled. Not only do I aim to find that, I aim to help others find that as well.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, the company already comes with a wonderful catalog. I'm very proud to working with these fine authors and want to make sure I can get their books in the hands of as many readers as possible. More will be added as I talk to each author about what they'd like to include about themselves.</p>
<p>Alison Rogers - <em>In Darkness and Light</em></p>
<p>Tracy Evans - <em>The Chalice </em>and <em>The Blood Crown</em> (The first two books in the Vampire Relics Trilogy. The third in the series will likely be the first book I put out through Fey Publishing).</p>
<p>Bill Kte'pi - <em>Low Country</em></p>
<p>Nicole Berman -<em> Home </em></p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>I understand times are tough for most of us. I've tried contributing to several campaigns and sometimes could only give a little or merely just spread the word to hopefully get others to donate. Every little bit helps me. No gesture is too small and I will be eternally grateful for all your support.</p>
<p>Even if you can't donate money at this time,  there are still ways to help if you'd like. For example, if you're someone who is able to do so, you could donate a perk. Perks can be books you've written (both electronic and physical copies), artwork, baked goods... you name it. I'm willing to offer up a ""Thank You"" section in the first anthology as well as on Fey's website to anyone who donates a perk. If you own a business and trying to sell your product, I'm happy to promote you as well. I'm all about finding ways to help each other out.</p>
<p>If there's nothing you can contribute at this time, even simply sharing my campaign with others would mean the world to me. The more people that hear of my campaign, the more likely I am to reach my goal. I appreciate any and all support you can offer me at this time, even if it's simply sharing it on your Facebook or blog. Thank you for all your support.</p>

<p>We believe in our content. Not only do we want to bring it to more people, but we need to! We need to get the word out about Women Write About Comics. Unless we build a bigger audience, our revenue stream won’t enable us to begin paying our writers or publishing in print. </p>
<p>Our first step with accrued funds is going to involve outreach: postcards, posters, online advertisement, and maybe even WWAC tables and sponsored panels at conventions.</p>

</div></div>","Why We're Here We—a group of one hundred women and non-binary writers—love bringing fresh, varied comics criticism and culture commentary to you. From fashion, to sex, to family, to discrimination, to geek culture, we speak frankly about all aspects of women’s lives. 

And we love what we do. We love it so much, in fact, that we’re all doing this for free! Currently we’re members of a small advertising network, but our ad revenue pays for site hosting and administrative costs, and that’s it. But we want WWAC to grow. We’re looking for funds to dramatically increase our reach and pay our hard-working writers. Our ultimate goal is to become a self-sustaining, independent publishing company.That’s a pretty big goal! But we’re confident that with your support, we can get there.   Who We Are 

WWAC is a group of geeky, feminist writers lead by Megan Purdy, Editor-In-Chief,  Wendy Browne and Claire Napier, Assistant Editors, Amanda Vail, Marketing Manager, and Section Editors Laura Harcourt, Kayleigh Hearn, Desiree Rodriguez, Al Rosenberg, Christa Seeley, and Ginnis Tonik.

We’re a good bet. As it is, Women Write About Comics has grown fast. We’re just three and a half years old, and already we’ve raised awareness and fostered change toward a diverse, inclusive industry. Just what have we done? Check out this list:

We provide critical analysis of controversial issues
We examine fashion and character design in relation to representation and presentation
We promote health and positive body image
We share tips on geek crafting, cooking, and parenting
We call out and discuss harassment and questionable practices
We shed light and support upon illness
We don’t let comics writers get away with transphobia (again, and again)
We speak openly about insecurity and abuse
We discuss the history of racist casting in Hollywood (often!)
We call out white privilege and the silencing of marginalized voices
We present problems with queer representation in comics and other media
We aren’t afraid to criticize popular industry icons
We’re proud of all that we’ve done so far. Right now, we have many wonderful staff writers and contributors, not to mention editors, copyeditors, and the leadership team. Many, many thanks to all of our staff and contributors for their hard work and dedication!

(*See examples of their professional accolades below under ""Getting to know our writers."") Supported also by graduate editor Ashley Williams, who pulled double duty on our project.Take a look at the exemplary work of our featured artists by viewing their websites containing past and ongoing artistic explorations.Samir Bernardez CabreraNestor Capparos- http://www.nestorcaparros.com/Gloria Ceren-  https://www.gloriaceren.com/ Will  Douglas -http://www.willwdoug.com/  Ben Galaday- https://bengaladay.squarespace.com/Zakriya Rabani- https://www.zakriyarabani.com/ Kim Turner Smith- http://kimturnerphotography.com/ *Getting to know our writers:Our graduate art historians are enthusiastic and active researchers in their respective fields. Their scholarship has been selected for both national and international conferences, including such recent selections as ""Crossing Boundaries: Creation of a Christian Identity and Negotiation of Religious Space in Armenian New Julfa,"" at the CEMS International Graduate Conference in Budapest, Hungary (Cartwright, 2017) and “Contemplating God Through Light: The Mosque Lamp of Karim al-Din within the Cross-Cultural Contexts of Abrahamic Religions,” at the Midwest Art History Society Conference in Cleveland, Ohio (Williams, 2017). Several historians have pursued their interests across the globe in study abroad programs in Paris, France and bi-annual excursions to the Venice Biennale. All proceeds will support the funding of this catalog. Art Research Forum will allocate any remaining funds toward publishing future catalogs and supporting further collaborations between practicing artists and art historians.

<p>My name is Paul O'Rear.</p>
<p><img alt=""Ashley O'Rear"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.paulorear.com/indiegogo/purplesunglasses1996.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: right; margin-left: 20px; margin-bottom: 10px;"" title=""Ashley O'Rear""/>My daughter Ashley was diagnosed with a malignant brain tumor when she was nine years old. She went through a year-and-a-half of radiation and chemo treatments, and it looked like she had beaten her cancer. She was cancer-free for a little over three years.</p>
<p>Then in the fall of 2001, her cancer came back. It was much more aggressive this time around, and about two-and-a-half months later, Ashley died. She was fourteen years old.</p>
<p>My grief journey has been nothing like I had expected. My wife Susan and I didn't go through a pre-packaged ""grief process"" like I had always heard about, with Stage 1 followed by Stage 2, and so on. In fact, we completely skipped a step or two in the classic progression of ""grief stages"", and amost felt a little guilty because of it!</p>
<p>As our grief journey continued, I discovered some very important and completely unexpected truths about grief.</p>
<ul>
<li>Hearts broken by grief cannot be fixed.</li>
<li>Each person grieves in their own way.</li>
<li>Grief and happiness can peacefully co-exist.</li>
<li>""All things work together for good to those who love God.""</li>
</ul><p>Some of these ideas run completely counter to what people expect from grief. Sometimes people place unrealistic expectations on the griever, based on the classic myths about grief. I think it is important for there to be a voice in the middle of all the noise saying, ""Hey, it's OK if your grief experience isn't like everyone else's, or like you expected it to be. It's OK if your heart is still broken months, or even years, down the road.""</p>
<p>That is why I have written <em>Living With a Broken Heart</em>, and that is why I feel compelled to get it into as many people's hands as I possibly can. Not only can it help the person who is grieving, it can help the person whose friend or loved one is grieving, and who wants to know what to do to help them.</p>
<h3>What I Need, and What You Get</h3>
<p>PRIMARY NEEDS</p>
<p>I need $600 to purchase the necessary software, training and support to get my manuscript ready for publishing to Kindle. The vendor for this bundle provides online training and support to help navigate through all the technical and formatting requirements necessary to produce a manuscript that is Kindle-ready. The software package they provide includes a cover art program and a propietary word processing program that has Kindle formatting built-in to streamline the process.</p>
<p>The remaining $300 covers the cost of running the IndieGoGo campaign (processing fees, partnership perks, etc.).</p>
<p>SECONDARY NEEDS</p>
<p>If I raise more than the $900 listed above, I will put the extra money toward:</p>
<ul>
<li>additional fees associated with additional donations.</li>
<li>purchasing a Kindle for purposes of testing the e-book on an actual Kindle device. Otherwise, I will just use the Kindle reader app on my laptop to test it.</li>
<li>marketing expenses to promote the book.</li>
<li>Caramel Macchiatos from Starbucks! :o)</li>
</ul><p>If the funding gets <strong><em>really crazy</em> </strong>(or I just get tired of Caramel Macchiatos), I'll use the left-over funds for other stuff, like maybe upgrading office equipment to help with this or future projects.</p>
<p>THE PERKS</p>
<p>I have assembled an assortment of tantalizing perks for the various partnership levels shown in the right column. Pick your level and enjoy your perks!</p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<div>
<p>I believe <em>Living With a Broken Heart</em> has the potential to bring a measure of peace to those who are grieving.</p>
<ul>
<li>It will help those who are grieving understand that they are not alone.</li>
<li>It will be a voice of support for whatever they are experiencing in their grief.</li>
<li>It will reassure them that it is OK to experience things in grief that are unique.</li>
<li>It will validate the fact that it is OK for their heart to stay broken.</li>
<li>It will give them hope that happiness can still be part of their lives, even when their hearts are broken.</li>
</ul>
<p>The positive impact that this can have on a grieving person's life is incalculable!</p>
<p>I believe <em>Living With a Broken Heart</em> also has the potential to be a source of inspiration for those who know someone else who is grieving.</p>
<ul>
<li>It will give them ideas for things they can do to help out their grieving friend.</li>
<li>It will reassure them that they don't have to figure out ""the right words"" to say to relieve their friend's suffering.</li>

<p>I'm Ivo Spigel.
Based in Zagreb, Croatia, I'm an entrepreneur myself, cofounder of an IT company called <a href=""http://www.perpetuum.hr/en"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Perpetuum Mobile</a>. I'm also a longtime writer
about technology and society. I've written for the Croatian edition of Forbes

co-founded the technology blog <a href=""http://www.tech.eu"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Tech.eu</a> with the mission of reporting on
companies, trends and players in the high-tech and startup ecosystems
throughout Europe.

<p>I've also
co-founded Croatia's leading startup accelerator, <a href=""http://www.zipzg.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">ZIP</a>, and have been a mentor at <a href=""http://www.seedcamp.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Seedcamp</a>, a leading European accelerator and early stage
investment fund.</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>The book is nearly done. I still need to do a few followup
interviews with some of the entrepreneurs as well as have the book copy edited
and the design and layout work done. </p>
<p>Then it will be time to produce both the e-book and printed
versions.</p>
<p>There could be hiccups and obstacles along the way but -
honestly - I don't expect any major issues. </p>
<p>The main problem might be my other obligations - helping to
manage my IT company with my partners, running ZIP and writing for Tech.eu in

</div>","Founders' stories from the
trenches

How do you
     get a $6 million investment based on a single tweet? 
Who
     provided shelter to the founders of Kazaa, chased by recording industry
     lawyers, while they built their next project - Skype?
Why did
     two Swedes decide to move from Stockholm to Berlin and start SoundCloud
     there?

As a cofounder
of the technology blog Tech.eu and a writer for publications such
as Forbes, Mreza (in Croatia) and others, over the past several years I've interviewed
some of Europe's most ambitious and successful technology entrepreneurs. They
have created amazing companies such as SoundCloud, Prezi, Last.fm, Mendeley,
Fon, Deezer, Supercell and many others - yet they are often overlooked by the
media in favor of American founders and CEO's. After years of
interviews and research, I've collected stories and interviews with 30 of these
entrepreneurs, from all across Europe, in a book: ""The European Startup
Revolution"". Four years in the making, the book covers their
experiences, failures and successes. In covering such a long time span, it
gives the reader a unique perspective of how they started out and where they
are today.

You'll want to
read this book if you're a:

Startup
     founder wise enough to learn from other people's mistakes - not just her
     own :-)
User of
     one of the many products created by these entrepreneurs who's curious
     about the back stories behind them
VC or
     angel investor who wants to help her or his investees on their difficult
     journey
Professional
     trapped in a corporation who needs just that additional bit of inspiration
     to take the plunge and - finally - go for the entrepreneurial dream
None of
     the above - but still curious about the stories and experiences of the
     women and men in the book
Lesley & Nigel Eccles - FanDuel.com
With my work
nearly complete, I need your support to finalize production and publication of
the e-book and print editions. Users of these companies' products, startup
founders and entrepreneurs from Europe and worldwide will find inspiration in
these stories. 
Europeans still
burn with the passion that led our ancestors to navigate the globe. Join me as
I report on their journeys and let's create The European Startup Revolution together!
Who am I? 
I'm Ivo Spigel.
Based in Zagreb, Croatia, I'm an entrepreneur myself, cofounder of an IT company called Perpetuum Mobile. I'm also a longtime writer
about technology and society. I've written for the Croatian edition of Forbes
magazine as well as the Croatian IT publication ""Mreza""
(""Network"").Late in 2013 I
co-founded the technology blog Tech.eu with the mission of reporting on
companies, trends and players in the high-tech and startup ecosystems
throughout Europe.

I've also
co-founded Croatia's leading startup accelerator, ZIP, and have been a mentor at Seedcamp, a leading European accelerator and early stage
investment fund.
**
The book is nearly done. I still need to do a few followup
interviews with some of the entrepreneurs as well as have the book copy edited
and the design and layout work done. 
Then it will be time to produce both the e-book and printed
versions.
There could be hiccups and obstacles along the way but -
honestly - I don't expect any major issues. 
The main problem might be my other obligations - helping to
manage my IT company with my partners, running ZIP and writing for Tech.eu in
parallel with finishing the book.I'm confident, however, that the book will be published, with your help and support, in late April or early May of this year!***
Stretch time!
The campaign goal was met in the late night hours of
Saturday, Feb 21! A huge *thank you* to everyone who contributed and helped
spread the good word. Now, of course, it's time for a stretch goal! The stretch
goal for this campaign is
                                                      $11,333
Why, you may ask? Well... I'll leave that answer to your
inner geek, and you're always free to ping me if you can't figure it out by
yourself (but of course you can).
What's my commitment if we reach this new goal?
I will add three
additional chapters to the book, featuring yet more amazing entrerpreneurs,
at least one of which will be from my native Croatia.
I will also donate 128 printed books to 128 Croatian high
schools. Maybe some kid out there gets inspired – you never know!

<h3>Who Am I?</h3>
<p>My name is Andrew Bozeman. I am a minister, writer, teacher, speaker, consutant. My mission and purpose in life is to help transform African American communities from symbols of poverty, frustration and pain to centers of propsperity, power and pride. I have been a minister since 1982. I have been a corporate trainer since 1988. I have operated and managed training operations that trained thousands of people. At one time in my life, I was also an award winning ad copywriter/producer for such clients as McDonalds, Budweiser and Coca-Cola.</p>
<p>I feel that it is now time to focus on my people -- African Americans -- and apply my talents and skills and experience to helping our communities revitalize.</p>
<p><span>The vehicle through which I will do this work is this project for which I am raising funds. It's title is HEAL THE PAIN OF RACISM...and Tear Down the Barriers to Success. It consists of 4 parts 1) a book to analyze and clarify the hidden effects of racism, racial discrimination and racial disparagement on African Americans; 2) a workbook to provide step-by-step guidance in self-healing; 3) a live workshop to provide in person training and 4) a DVD to provide continuous reinforcement for the viewer.   </span></p>
<p><span><br/>By helping fund this project, you become a part of a movement that can change the world not only for African Americans but for all minorities.

It is a time of joining together for the betterment of our world.<br/></span></p>
<p><span><strong> Our Budget</strong><br/></span></p>
<p>Our goal is to raise $28,875 to cover the costs of publishing, design, promotion and production of the entire project.The first element to be produced is the book because it is the basis of everything else. That is followed by the workbook which supports the workshops. The DVD is a videotaped version of the workshops. This will provide continual reinforcement of the lessons learned in the workshop  plus any additional exercises or activities which are of value to the viewer. Our initial budget is below:</p>

<h2>About the Project</h2>
<p>Your contribution to this project will help cover the printing costs.</p>
<h3 style=""color: #990000;"">A minimum of 100 books from this project will be donated to the Old Spanish Days non-profit, the organization who puts on Fiesta each year. If we reach $30,000 in funding, we will donate at least 200 books to them!</h3>
<p>This 240 page, 12 x 12 inch coffee table book takes you through Old Spanish Days’ annual Fiesta celebration in Santa Barbara, California. This world-renown, annual festival first began in 1924. The book contains more than 600 intriguing photographs from a plethora of interesting perspectives and historic locations. For three years, I served as the Official Old Spanish Days photographer, which benefited me with privileged access. From front row and on-stage with the dancers, to middle-of-the-street parade shots, to back-stage and behind the scenes, you’ll experience Fiesta like you’ve never seen it before.</p>
<p>The purpose of this book is not to be a historical retrospective but rather to provide a colorful documentation of what you might see if you tried to take in all the major Fiesta events of today.</p>
<p><strong>See the ""<a href=""http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/fiesta-old-spanish-days-santa-barbara-california-a-coffee-table-book/x/2552424?c=gallery"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Gallery</a>"" tab above for a slideshow of 635 images, which pretty well represents what's included in Draft 4 of the book.</strong></p>

<p> </p>
<h2>Certificates for Prints</h2>
<p>Many of the pledge options include a certificate for a print of any image in the book. (All measurements are in inches.) The certificate will be delivered around the same time as the book, so this gives you an opportunity to peruse the book before deciding which image you'd like printed.</p>
<p>In case you want a smaller print, you may choose an image size up to the size offered on your certificate. The size on the certificate represents the maximum size for which it is redeemable, and it includes shipping to the USA.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that over the eleven years of photography covered in this book, I used at least ten different cameras. Photos became increasingly better as the technology improved. That said, some images in the book, especially the older ones, might not be suitable for print at very large sizes. I can help you choose an excellent image to fulfill your print certificate.<img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://incolor.net/1px.gif"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>I am a certified digital print-maker, so these prints will be made with the highest-quality equipment and materials. You can read more about prints on my website, <a href=""http://artfisher.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://artfisher.com</a>.</p>
<h2>History of Old Spanish Days – Fiesta</h2>
<p>Santa Barbarans have long been proud of their city’s heritage from Spanish founders and from the Spanish, Mexican and North American pioneers who first settled here and built the city. The tradition of colorful music, dance and song, together with a spirit of friendliness, hospitality and tolerance are part of this heritage, which Fiesta, Old Spanish Days In Santa Barbara, seeks to preserve and perpetuate.</p>
<p>In the year 1924, the first Fiesta celebration took place to provide Santa Barbara with an annual summer event to entertain and attract visitors. The city had come to be a favorite place for winter tourists, but these visitors had not been drawn here in any considerable number during the summer months.</p>
<p>Since then, Fiesta has grown to become the largest annual celebration of California's Spanish heritage found anywhere in the state.</p>
<h2>Fiesta Today</h2>
<p>Over the years, the Fiesta celebration has come to embody more than a dozen distinct events and locations, budding with Santa Barbara’s local color, tradition and heritage.</p>
<p>Iconic locations, such as the Santa Barbara Mission, Santa Barbara Courthouse, State Street, El Paseo Restaurant, Paseo Nuevo, Santa Barbara Bowl, Earl Warren Showgrounds and the classic mercados &amp; cantinas have all become home to Fiesta’s multitude of popular events.</p>
<p>Each year the grand finale of Fiesta takes place for a full week around the beginning of August. For months before that, however, the city ramps up with fundraisers, dance contests, costume sales and float building. Tens of thousands of people flock to Santa Barbara to watch and participate as hundreds more sing, perform historic dances, and ride horses &amp; carriages in parades.</p>
<p>Local businesses close their doors early to celebrate one of the largest equestrian parades in the country. Hundreds of children and adults, decked in authentic costume, dance flamenco, folklórico, salsa, and ballet on stages throughout the city. The bars and mercados go crazy with locals and out-of-towners. And two different parades fill the streets with colorful entertainment.</p>
<h2>Large Pledges</h2>
<p>The CORPORATE, BUSINESS and GENEROUS level pledge amounts are not intended for resellers. These levels are designed for organizations who want to reward their employees, patrons or friends with the book as a gift.</p>
<p>If you are interested in reselling the book, please contact me through my website, <a href=""http://artfisher.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://artfisher.com</a></p>
<h2>The Numbers</h2>
<p>My goal is to print 3,000 books. The out-of-pocket production costs to do so will total nearly $40,000. Including expenses already incurred, I have personally set aside a at least $12,000 to invest in this project.</p>
<p>In addition to my investment, the $20,000 project goal is the minimum amount needed to produce 2,000 of these books, which is the smallest feasible press run. If we can raise more money, we can print more books, so don't hesitate to pledge just because we've reached our goal!</p>
<p>If you order books online after this project has closed, you will likely pay additional charges for shipping.</p>
<h2>Schedule</h2>
<p>This isn't my first publication. I've worked on books twice the size; although, this is the biggest book project I've done without another publisher involved.<br/><br/>The book production process is nearly complete. The process (excluding the eleven years of photography) began last June, and I have already created four sets of full-size, fully bound drafts. (Draft 4 is on display at the El Paseo Restaurant in Santa Barbara.) The project is already very mature, so we don't expect any delays in going to press. For the last three months, most of the production has revolved around perfecting things.<br/><br/>I'm very confident in the final color and technical aspects of the book. I'm still working on proofing the dust jacket, which will be printed in four-color process plus two touch plates to maximize the saturation of the reds and blues. It will take at least two rounds of proofing, each taking a full week, but I don't foresee any problems that would delay this process beyond the close date of the funding stage.<br/><br/>We have a best case and worst case schedule scenario worked out with our printer. We will probably end up somewhere in between them, but the worst case scenario puts the books in our hands on July 15th, which is still a couple weeks before the main Fiesta events begin.<br/><br/>Barring any circumstances that are out of my control, we should be on schedule to begin book delivery by late July.</p>
<h2>Payment Through PayPal</h2>
<p>This project is setup to process payments via PayPal, who implements certain limits on the amount of money that you can send. If you're paying as a guest in PayPal (no account necessary), you will not be able to contribute more than $500. You will also only be able to use PayPal's guest checkout process up to 15 times with a total spending limit of 4,000. Once you reach PayPal's maximum, you will be prompted to upgrade to a full PayPal account.</p>
<p>Setting up a PayPal account is free, but spending over $5000 requires a verified account, which can take a couple days. Please don't hesitate to call me if you're having problems contributing: 805-564-2428</p>

That said, some images in the book, especially the older ones, might not be suitable for print at very large sizes. I can help you choose an excellent image to fulfill your print certificate.
I am a certified digital print-maker, so these prints will be made with the highest-quality equipment and materials. You can read more about prints on my website, http://artfisher.com.
History of Old Spanish Days – Fiesta
Santa Barbarans have long been proud of their city’s heritage from Spanish founders and from the Spanish, Mexican and North American pioneers who first settled here and built the city. The tradition of colorful music, dance and song, together with a spirit of friendliness, hospitality and tolerance are part of this heritage, which Fiesta, Old Spanish Days In Santa Barbara, seeks to preserve and perpetuate.
In the year 1924, the first Fiesta celebration took place to provide Santa Barbara with an annual summer event to entertain and attract visitors. The city had come to be a favorite place for winter tourists, but these visitors had not been drawn here in any considerable number during the summer months.
Since then, Fiesta has grown to become the largest annual celebration of California's Spanish heritage found anywhere in the state.
Fiesta Today
Over the years, the Fiesta celebration has come to embody more than a dozen distinct events and locations, budding with Santa Barbara’s local color, tradition and heritage.
Iconic locations, such as the Santa Barbara Mission, Santa Barbara Courthouse, State Street, El Paseo Restaurant, Paseo Nuevo, Santa Barbara Bowl, Earl Warren Showgrounds and the classic mercados & cantinas have all become home to Fiesta’s multitude of popular events.
Each year the grand finale of Fiesta takes place for a full week around the beginning of August. For months before that, however, the city ramps up with fundraisers, dance contests, costume sales and float building. Tens of thousands of people flock to Santa Barbara to watch and participate as hundreds more sing, perform historic dances, and ride horses & carriages in parades.
Local businesses close their doors early to celebrate one of the largest equestrian parades in the country. Hundreds of children and adults, decked in authentic costume, dance flamenco, folklórico, salsa, and ballet on stages throughout the city. The bars and mercados go crazy with locals and out-of-towners. And two different parades fill the streets with colorful entertainment.
Large Pledges
The CORPORATE, BUSINESS and GENEROUS level pledge amounts are not intended for resellers. These levels are designed for organizations who want to reward their employees, patrons or friends with the book as a gift.
If you are interested in reselling the book, please contact me through my website, http://artfisher.com
The Numbers
My goal is to print 3,000 books. The out-of-pocket production costs to do so will total nearly $40,000. Including expenses already incurred, I have personally set aside a at least $12,000 to invest in this project.
In addition to my investment, the $20,000 project goal is the minimum amount needed to produce 2,000 of these books, which is the smallest feasible press run. If we can raise more money, we can print more books, so don't hesitate to pledge just because we've reached our goal!
If you order books online after this project has closed, you will likely pay additional charges for shipping.
Schedule
This isn't my first publication. I've worked on books twice the size; although, this is the biggest book project I've done without another publisher involved.The book production process is nearly complete. The process (excluding the eleven years of photography) began last June, and I have already created four sets of full-size, fully bound drafts. (Draft 4 is on display at the El Paseo Restaurant in Santa Barbara.) The project is already very mature, so we don't expect any delays in going to press. For the last three months, most of the production has revolved around perfecting things.I'm very confident in the final color and technical aspects of the book. I'm still working on proofing the dust jacket, which will be printed in four-color process plus two touch plates to maximize the saturation of the reds and blues. It will take at least two rounds of proofing, each taking a full week, but I don't foresee any problems that would delay this process beyond the close date of the funding stage.We have a best case and worst case schedule scenario worked out with our printer. We will probably end up somewhere in between them, but the worst case scenario puts the books in our hands on July 15th, which is still a couple weeks before the main Fiesta events begin.Barring any circumstances that are out of my control, we should be on schedule to begin book delivery by late July.
Payment Through PayPal
This project is setup to process payments via PayPal, who implements certain limits on the amount of money that you can send. If you're paying as a guest in PayPal (no account necessary), you will not be able to contribute more than $500. You will also only be able to use PayPal's guest checkout process up to 15 times with a total spending limit of 4,000. Once you reach PayPal's maximum, you will be prompted to upgrade to a full PayPal account.
Setting up a PayPal account is free, but spending over $5000 requires a verified account, which can take a couple days. Please don't hesitate to call me if you're having problems contributing: 805-564-2428

<h3>About Us</h3>
<p>At Tarotcollectibles, we are well known for creating several versions of cards during our Tarot projects. Following on the heels of our runaway success The Trippin Waite Tarot, which was inspired by the late 60's early 70's psychedelic art, The Groovy Waite is comprised of a few great artworks and concepts that did not make it into the Trippin' Waite along with all new works inspired by working on that deck.</p>
<p><br/>Ever since the huge success of our Trippin Waite, people have been asking if there would ever be any bonus images or even a spin-off project from the original Trippin' Waite campaign. With the Groovy Waite, we've amped up the imagery even more. More bell bottoms, more beautifully patterned clothing and more trippy scenes.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1561496395/v9i3sp9vi0ywucil0khp.jpg"" src=""""/><br/> </p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1561371818/y1rkiowdndc5m1uohspv.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>The chart above is a rough estimate and is based on being fully funded.<br/><br/>Ideally we need $2,600 for card printing, which will include shipping and customs fees to Ireland. We estimate roughly 20 percent of our funds will go towards campaign fees (this includes, but is not limited to, all transaction fees, a reserve fee that Indiegogo places on campaigns for the purposes of refunds, Indiegogo's initial campaign fee, and because we’re in the UK, we have to pay £25 as a transfer fee. (Roughly 30 U.S Dollars). Anything extra will be reserved for hidden fees (which usually make an appearance)</p>
<p>If we make more than this, some of it will go towards a future print run on another project we have on the horizon.<br/><br/>*A further $600 towards shipping costs will be required to ship our rewards to backers but we've decided to handle these ourselves. We're using Indiegogo to raise funds for the initial card printing.</p>
<h3><strong>About The Cards</strong></h3>
<p>Card size : 70mm x 121mm (similar in size to our Trippin' Waite)</p>
<p>Card stock: 350gsm (this card stock has proved popular with our Trippin' Waite, so we're opting for a similar thickness)</p>
<p>Printer: If we're fully funded, we plan on using Shenzen Wanjing Printing Company (WJPC), the great company that printed our Trippin' Waite.</p>
<p>* Full funding will guarantee we can provide a full color box with each deck.<br/><br/>We will opt for a PDF rather than a little card meanings book. This will be created soon after the deck has been printing and will be fully printable from our website.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1561492559/ehtzxpzq2tbgtgp5l1ys.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<h3>Perks</h3>
<p>Some of the perks are very limited in number. We are only interested in raising enough funds to print the cards. Being able to crowd fund a deck not only helps us continue to produce new and exciting works of art for you and others to enjoy; it also gives us an indication if a project is popular enough to warrant a much bigger print run.<br/><br/><br/>*PLEASE NOTE that the decks will probably not be signed if we are not fully funded, only because if we opt for print on demand, these decks usually ship from the manufacturer, not our studio.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1561497658/megbzxhqc4fm9pljnqds.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Tier 1 (Early Bird Special) will receive a signed copy of the Groovy Waite at 30% off the regular price of decks on our site. We can guarantee that we will never sell this deck at this price after the campaign. Limited to 50 decks, our early bird special is our way of saying thank you to those who pledge early.</p>

<p>Tier 2 will receive a signed Groovy Waite deck and a set of 18 stickers based on some of the images from our popular Trippin' Waite deck. 3x Page of Swords, 3x The Hermit, 3x The Magician, 3x The Hanged Man, 3x The High Priestess and 3x the 2 of Cups. (Normally retailing on our site at $13.00)</p>

<p>Tier 3 will receive both a signed copy of the Groovy Waite and a signed copy of our very popular Trippin' Waite. Limited to 20 entries, this is your chance to own the Trippin' Waite if it's not part of your collection already. For the great price of $30 each, you can receive these two independently produced psychedelic style decks. I foresee the possibility of this tier selling out quite quickly, so act now! (Our Trippin' Waite stock is currently very low but these 20 decks are set aside to aid the funding of this campaign)</p>
<p>SHIPPING</p>
<p>We usually always include free shipping all the way from Ireland, but this time around we have decided to add £4.00 (which converts to roughly around $5.00 U.S) to the price of shipping perks to anyone outside of Europe, The United States, Canada and the UK. While shipping has risen increasingly over the past few years, we're always doing our best to factor shipping into the price of the product itself.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1561496503/v2mbypkog64ob7wqolnq.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<h3>What If We Don't Reach Our Goal?</h3>
<p>If we don't reach our goal, the funds will still go towards the printing of the deck. If we reach most of the funding, we'll add the rest to get a decent print run. If we make much less, we will still deliver the rewards to our backers, but will have to use a print on demand source to achieve this. If you look at every one of our previous campaigns; Dead Waite Tarot, Trippin' Waite, Twisted Tarot Tales and Kiddy Katz/ Spooky Cats, you will see that we've always honoured backer rewards regardless of if we reach full funding or not (but of course it will be much easier if we receive full funding to do this)</p>
</div><div>
<h3>How You Help Us</h3>
<p>It can be difficult to make a living by being a self published, self promoting artist, but your contribution allows us to keep making original art at an affordable price* . Over the years, our backers' support have allowed us to make some of our decks even more affordable (through bulk printings on some of our decks) allowing the market to open up for us, but also allowing us the opportunity to serve customers from further afield.<br/><br/>*when compared to many other indie artists.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Because we draw a lot of our own images, some of our past projects have taken a few months longer than we had initially anticipated. While we do our very best to stick to a deadline, in the past we have had occasions where we've run over the deadline. Sometimes we spot a card or two that we could've done better on, and we don't feel it's ready to be officially printed. Other times, when we have not reached our goal, we will have to negotiate a little longer with printers and supply companies to get the best deal with the budget we have. Being funded early in our campaign will give us more reassurance that we can proceed with printing with less haggling on the horizon!</p>
<p>Unless funding is dismal, we usually try to go above and beyond what we promise backers, but again, we always deliver on our campaigns because we always price our reward tiers accordingly.</p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>You can help our campaign along by sharing our page with your friends too. Word of mouth is always a big help to us as indie artists who don't have the power of a big publisher behind us.</div></div>","About Us

Limited to 20 entries, this is your chance to own the Trippin' Waite if it's not part of your collection already. For the great price of $30 each, you can receive these two independently produced psychedelic style decks. I foresee the possibility of this tier selling out quite quickly, so act now! (Our Trippin' Waite stock is currently very low but these 20 decks are set aside to aid the funding of this campaign)
SHIPPING
We usually always include free shipping all the way from Ireland, but this time around we have decided to add £4.00 (which converts to roughly around $5.00 U.S) to the price of shipping perks to anyone outside of Europe, The United States, Canada and the UK. While shipping has risen increasingly over the past few years, we're always doing our best to factor shipping into the price of the product itself.

What If We Don't Reach Our Goal?
If we don't reach our goal, the funds will still go towards the printing of the deck. If we reach most of the funding, we'll add the rest to get a decent print run. If we make much less, we will still deliver the rewards to our backers, but will have to use a print on demand source to achieve this. If you look at every one of our previous campaigns; Dead Waite Tarot, Trippin' Waite, Twisted Tarot Tales and Kiddy Katz/ Spooky Cats, you will see that we've always honoured backer rewards regardless of if we reach full funding or not (but of course it will be much easier if we receive full funding to do this)

How You Help Us
It can be difficult to make a living by being a self published, self promoting artist, but your contribution allows us to keep making original art at an affordable price* . Over the years, our backers' support have allowed us to make some of our decks even more affordable (through bulk printings on some of our decks) allowing the market to open up for us, but also allowing us the opportunity to serve customers from further afield.*when compared to many other indie artists.

Risks & Challenges
Because we draw a lot of our own images, some of our past projects have taken a few months longer than we had initially anticipated. While we do our very best to stick to a deadline, in the past we have had occasions where we've run over the deadline. Sometimes we spot a card or two that we could've done better on, and we don't feel it's ready to be officially printed. Other times, when we have not reached our goal, we will have to negotiate a little longer with printers and supply companies to get the best deal with the budget we have. Being funded early in our campaign will give us more reassurance that we can proceed with printing with less haggling on the horizon!
Unless funding is dismal, we usually try to go above and beyond what we promise backers, but again, we always deliver on our campaigns because we always price our reward tiers accordingly.

<p>If you've noticed over the past year, there's been many discussions revolving about the history of Ethiopia. But more times than not, these discussions or debates about the country's history is from a biased or incomplete vantage lens. People mixing folklore that's been passed down to them or stating second or third hand accounts of rumors as historical facts. What I've noticed seeing all these debates is that people are hungry to learn about their history and where they come from!

<p>At the Drumlummon Institute, our mission is ""to promote and publish art and literatures created in Montana and the broader American West"". We've reprinted and rejuvenated interest in many neglected Montana authors, including Grace Stone Coates and Thomas Savage.

<p>Rick DeMarinis is one of Montana's finest and most versatile writers. He won the prestigious Drue Heinz Contest for his stunning collection, <i>Under the Wheat</i> in 1986. His short story ""Gent"" (a version of which appears in T<i>he Burning Women of Far Cry</i>) was selected by John Updike as one of the top 100 short stories of the century. He's published a dozen novels and countless short stories, and he taught writing as a craft for many years at various universities. In 2016, Rick received a lifetime achievement award from the University of Montana:</p>

<p>We love The Burning Women of Far Cry because while it tells a distinctly ""Montana"" story, it is does not fit into the general category of what people think of when they hear the word ""Montana"" or think of ""Montana literature."" This book is in a class alone: it is outrageously funny, deeply tragic, and philosophical in ways that are unusual for any novel, especially one involving a young man working in a sawmill in Montana in the 1960s. We love this novel not just because it tells a great story, but because it stands unique on the landscape of the state's fiction, a singular monument to a class of people seldom noticed who nevertheless epitomize what the great critic (and UM professor) Leslie Fiedler referred to as ""The Montana Face.""</p>
<p>The new edition will feature an introduction by president of Drumlummon (and University of Great Falls English Professor), Dr. Aaron Parrett, author of  Montana Then and Now (2014); Literary Butte: A History in Novels and Films (2015); and the forthcoming Maple and Lead, a letterpress fiction collaboration with printmaker Seth Roby. </p>
<p>Here's what this campaign is all about and what we're raising money for: a handsome, affordable, paperback edition of <i>The Burning Women of Far Cry</i> . We want to get this book back in the hands of readers across the state! </p>
<p>Here's what we think it will cost to make that happen: </p>
<p>$2000 to remunerate the author for a new edition; </p>
<p>$1000 to have a copy of the first edition scanned into document form, so that we can edit and redesign the text (no electronic file of the book exists presently);</p>
<p>$2000 for layout and design and editing. </p>
<p>$4500 for 1000 copies (factory printed, perfect bound). </p>
<p>$500 for shipping. </p>
<p>That's it, in a nutshell. </p>
<p>Why are we crowdfunding this? All of our previous projects have relied on the generosity of our donors and patrons, many of whom have supported Drumlummon from its inception in 2006. Like most nonprofits, we fund our publishing efforts out of the funds we raise throughout the year. But for this project, we wanted to try something different. We want to extend our invitation for a chance to support getting this book back in print to all of Rick's fans, and to all fans of Montana's rich literary tradition, to folks who may not hear about it otherwise.  This volume will be Volume 7 in the Drumlummon Montana Literary Masters Series (previous titles include Thomas Savage's The Pass, Grace Stone Coates' Clear Title, and the selected poems of Roger Dunsmore [forthcoming]).  </p>
<p>We're hoping that people with whom we share this page will not only contribute to it, but that they will spread the word and pass the link along! </p>
<p>What we're offering you: while we will welcome any and all contributions to our campaign, we're offering some excellent premiums and rewards to contributors at various levels. Whether you pre-order your copy of <i>The Burning Women of Far Cry</i>, or you choose one of the other premiums we're offering, we want contributors to get something tangible for supporting literature and the arts in Montana. (Of course, we are grateful and deeply appreciative to donors who are generous enough to just contribute to the cause without signing up for a reward also!)</p>
<p>As our board president has conducted two very successful crowdfunding campaigns of his own, we are reasonably confident that this effort will succeed, and that within a few months we will be distributing copies of this amazing book to ours and Rick's fans,  patrons, and benefactors, we acknowledge that the reality of publishing books involves certain risks. But everyone on the board at Drumlummon has been involved with non-profits and the arts in Montana one way or another for decades, and we feel we can rely on our extensive networks of logistical support to head off any crises as we carry this project to completion. </p>
<p>We're tremendously excited to see this book back in the hands of readers who love Montana fiction, and we are sincerely grateful for your interest in and support of this project!</p>

0,"<div class=""routerContentStory-storyBody"" data-v-1df7bf5a=""""><h2>Story of My Book</h2><p><i>My Song to Sing</i> explores my personal journey through early adulthood to find themes and wisdom from what is a very transformative time for us all. I share my experiences, thoughts, and impressions from high school and college to ultimately reflect on my personal development and how we all do truly encounter the same, significant questions when determining the trajectory of our lives.<br/><br/>My name is Adam Brock and I am the author of <i>My Song to Sing</i>. I wrote this memoir because I’ve always enjoyed doing things a little differently from the norm, or what’s traditionally expected of us as we grow up and discover who we want to be. Now that the dust has finally settled since my graduation from college this past spring, it’s clear that my path from a young ice hockey player and referee to a clarinet performer, then to an engineering major, and finally to an English teaching assistant in Austria is no accident. People sometimes ask me, “Adam, how can an engineer go teach English in Austria?” I like to think that this book is my most comprehensive attempt at giving them an answer.<br/><br/>In reading this memoir, you will discover how you truly have the power to take a leap of faith on your ambitions, passions, and dreams. All I ask is that you travel back in time with me in my book to see how analyzing our pasts is the key to transforming today’s uncertainty into the future we desire. You will love <i>My Song to Sing</i> if you have an interest in understanding how my transformative journey shares themes and messages which resonate from mine to yours. We'll prove together how you too can make the change you want to see in your life.</p><p><u>Ultimately, I hope that my memoir inspires reflection on questions such as:</u></p><ul>
<li>What are the necessary building blocks for facilitating effective and intentional change?</li>
<li>How do we navigate uncertainty and external pressures?</li>

I share my experiences, thoughts, and impressions from high school and college to ultimately reflect on my personal development and how we all do truly encounter the same, significant questions when determining the trajectory of our lives.My name is Adam Brock and I am the author of My Song to Sing. I wrote this memoir because I’ve always enjoyed doing things a little differently from the norm, or what’s traditionally expected of us as we grow up and discover who we want to be. Now that the dust has finally settled since my graduation from college this past spring, it’s clear that my path from a young ice hockey player and referee to a clarinet performer, then to an engineering major, and finally to an English teaching assistant in Austria is no accident. People sometimes ask me, “Adam, how can an engineer go teach English in Austria?” I like to think that this book is my most comprehensive attempt at giving them an answer.In reading this memoir, you will discover how you truly have the power to take a leap of faith on your ambitions, passions, and dreams. All I ask is that you travel back in time with me in my book to see how analyzing our pasts is the key to transforming today’s uncertainty into the future we desire. You will love My Song to Sing if you have an interest in understanding how my transformative journey shares themes and messages which resonate from mine to yours. We'll prove together how you too can make the change you want to see in your life.Ultimately, I hope that my memoir inspires reflection on questions such as:
What are the necessary building blocks for facilitating effective and intentional change?
How do we navigate uncertainty and external pressures?
What will bring us peace and happiness with our contributions to society?
How do we take a leap of faith to pursue our ambitions and dreams?
 I very much look forward to exploring these questions in my memoir and taking you along for a ride in the passenger seat of my car as we travel on the long, winding road that brought my life to where it is now in Austria.My Song to Sing in 7 PartsPart 1 contains the introduction and my experiences with ice hockey and music performance during high school that facilitate the beginning of my self-discovery.Part 2 describes my first year as a student at Temple University, a time where I find that our expectations in life don’t always match the impending reality.

<h4>                                                    The Diary</h4>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">An historic  WWII diary will be returned to the country where it was written - Thailand.  The diary will be housed at the </span><a href=""http://www.tbrconline.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Thailand-Burma Railway Center </a><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">(TBRC), preserved indefinitely for future generations to read.  My father, Dr. Edward Emery was a physician in the British Royal Army Medical Corps when he was captured by the Japanese Imperial Army in December 1942.  Initially incarcerated in the infamous 'Changi' jail in Singapore, he was later moved by rail up to Thailand, where he spent two years in three separate POW camps, including </span><i style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Chaunggahla-ya,</i> <i style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Thanbaya </i><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">and finally at the </span><i style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Tarsao</i><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> hospital in Kanchanaburi </span>where he<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> cared for men working on the ""Death Railway"".  Dr. Emery secretly kept this diary at great personal risk; the Japanese would torture, even kill, any POW found writing a journal or documenting daily events.</span></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">I have dreamed of returning my dad's diary to the place where it was written ever since he bequeathed it to me upon his death in 2002.  It is something I feel destined</span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> to do.  To visit and quietly reflect for a moment in the places where he wrote these pages, often in such unimaginable desperation, means the world to me.  The diary pages are fragile, beginning to disintegrate; placing it in a </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">museum</span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> is the right thing to do, especially one located so close to where it was written and dedicated to preserving the history of this terrible time.  The compassionate medical attention that my father was able to provide the countless men under his care will not be forgotten.  Edward Emery's account is a rare and important historical document.  This journey will help me return it to where it belongs and to protect it for posterity. </span></p>

<p>After reading my father's diary, I was moved to write a novel inspired by his journey.  I began to research the Pacific War and was astonished at how little information has been written about it.  I learned of atrocities carried out by the Japanese Imperial Army that were comparable to those of the Nazis, yet most of these were virtually undocumented in the 'West'.  Inadvertently I stumbled upon the 'Golden Lily'.  The ramifications of this covert Japanese operation still linger 73 years later.  Clandestine deals made in 1945  between the OSS (former CIA), the Japanese Mafia and the Imperial family continue to impact global financial and political arenas.  Of course, it is hotly denied by the implicated governments, however, thanks to the dedication and courage of a few individuals, unearthed documentation proving its validity is now being brought to light and accepted more widely. </p>
<p>This predicament gave me an even more compelling reason to create a novel that not only documented the historical journey of my father, but provided an authentic backdrop for an exciting story that could entertain, while educating the public.  And, because social issues are so close to my heart, the story weaves in timeless themes, still sadly prevalent today, such as sex trafficking, exploitation of the environment and Indigenous peoples, all fueled by corruption and greed.  The novel is completed.  I am actively seeking a Literary Agent/Publisher.  This campaign will help me to promote my novel to prospective parties.  If I am not able to publish through those channels, I will self-publish in 2016.</p>

<p>My name is Rosie Emery.  I was born in Kuala Lumpur,
Malaya, grew up in Sherwood Forest, U.K., and currently split my time between Canada and the US.  Between birth and now… I’ve chalked up a few
miles and done a variety of things along the way: </p>
<p>I’m an… author, singer/songwriter,television writer, producer &amp; director as well as an environmental education program creator &amp; facilitator amongst other things.  I have set out to accomplish many projects in my lifetime, I am proud to say, they have all been realized.  I am anxious to see this latest endeavour through to fruition as well.</p>
<p>In my thirty-year career as a creative artist I have touched many lives: through my international children’s musical tours, my children’s music CD’s and the award-winning children’s television shows I've been privileged to write and produce.  None of it would have been possible without the support of family, friends and individual donors.  If you’d like to learn more, please visit my website at: <a href=""http://www.rosieemery.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.rosieemery.com</a> (full bio @ bottom left corner).</p>

<p>Thank you.... for taking the time to learn about my father's story and mine ... for your contribution if you have made one, and even if you haven't, it means a lot to me that you stopped by.  We all give what we can in different ways. </p>
</div></div>","What will be achieved?

        

                                                    The Diary
An historic  WWII diary will be returned to the country where it was written - Thailand.  The diary will be housed at the Thailand-Burma Railway Center (TBRC), preserved indefinitely for future generations to read.  My father, Dr. Edward Emery was a physician in the British Royal Army Medical Corps when he was captured by the Japanese Imperial Army in December 1942.  Initially incarcerated in the infamous 'Changi' jail in Singapore, he was later moved by rail up to Thailand, where he spent two years in three separate POW camps, including Chaunggahla-ya, Thanbaya and finally at the Tarsao hospital in Kanchanaburi where he cared for men working on the ""Death Railway"".  Dr. Emery secretly kept this diary at great personal risk; the Japanese would torture, even kill, any POW found writing a journal or documenting daily events.
I have dreamed of returning my dad's diary to the place where it was written ever since he bequeathed it to me upon his death in 2002.  It is something I feel destined to do.  To visit and quietly reflect for a moment in the places where he wrote these pages, often in such unimaginable desperation, means the world to me.  The diary pages are fragile, beginning to disintegrate; placing it in a museum is the right thing to do, especially one located so close to where it was written and dedicated to preserving the history of this terrible time.  The compassionate medical attention that my father was able to provide the countless men under his care will not be forgotten.  Edward Emery's account is a rare and important historical document.  This journey will help me return it to where it belongs and to protect it for posterity. 

                                                     The Novel




                                                                                 

After reading my father's diary, I was moved to write a novel inspired by his journey.  I began to research the Pacific War and was astonished at how little information has been written about it.  I learned of atrocities carried out by the Japanese Imperial Army that were comparable to those of the Nazis, yet most of these were virtually undocumented in the 'West'.  Inadvertently I stumbled upon the 'Golden Lily'.  The ramifications of this covert Japanese operation still linger 73 years later.  Clandestine deals made in 1945  between the OSS (former CIA), the Japanese Mafia and the Imperial family continue to impact global financial and political arenas.  Of course, it is hotly denied by the implicated governments, however, thanks to the dedication and courage of a few individuals, unearthed documentation proving its validity is now being brought to light and accepted more widely. 
This predicament gave me an even more compelling reason to create a novel that not only documented the historical journey of my father, but provided an authentic backdrop for an exciting story that could entertain, while educating the public.  And, because social issues are so close to my heart, the story weaves in timeless themes, still sadly prevalent today, such as sex trafficking, exploitation of the environment and Indigenous peoples, all fueled by corruption and greed.  The novel is completed.  I am actively seeking a Literary Agent/Publisher.  This campaign will help me to promote my novel to prospective parties.  If I am not able to publish through those channels, I will self-publish in 2016.


Your contribution




Will fund the return of the diary to where it was written, where it will remain encased in a museum.  


Will enable me to promote and market my new novel, inspired by the diary, to attract the interest of prospective agents and publishers.


Will raise awareness about prevailing social issues in the region (and globally) such as sex trafficking; the displacement of Indigenous peoples and the importance of the region's biodiversity.  


Will allow me to volunteer at centers in Thailand and Malaya for children and girls rescued from sex trafficking.


I will also be Live-BLOGGING the journey.  The BLOG will facilitate:
a)  Highlighting of locations featured in the novel: temples such as the Temple of the Golden Dragon,  ancient Khmer cities and The Royal Belum State Park
b)  Introductions to admirable people we meet along the way such as  Sudarat who is working with several NGO's to help victims of sex-trafficking as many young girls are kidnapped from the Hilltribes.
c)  Sharing information about the Orang Asli Indigenous people of the Malay Peninsula who have made this region their home for 55,000 years.
d)  Illumination of Sustainability projects happening in the Malay Peninsula.  
                                  Who am I?

                                




My name is Rosie Emery.  I was born in Kuala Lumpur,
Malaya, grew up in Sherwood Forest, U.K., and currently split my time between Canada and the US.  Between birth and now… I’ve chalked up a few
miles and done a variety of things along the way: 
I’m an… author, singer/songwriter,television writer, producer & director as well as an environmental education program creator & facilitator amongst other things.  I have set out to accomplish many projects in my lifetime, I am proud to say, they have all been realized.  I am anxious to see this latest endeavour through to fruition as well.
In my thirty-year career as a creative artist I have touched many lives: through my international children’s musical tours, my children’s music CD’s and the award-winning children’s television shows I've been privileged to write and produce.  None of it would have been possible without the support of family, friends and individual donors.  If you’d like to learn more, please visit my website at: www.rosieemery.com (full bio @ bottom left corner).

<h3>Wow!!  Thank you, everyone!  The campaign is over, but you can still pre-order the book on our website:</h3>
<p><a href=""http://www.bluebirdhillhomestead.com/peter-and-the-owl/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.bluebirdhillhomestead.com/peter-and-the-owl/</a></p>
<p> </p>
<h3>I did it!  I finished the book!!  And all the illustrations too!!!</h3>
<p>You can pre-order your Hardcover copy of this children's book at 25% off the cover price!  I am raising the money to publish the book myself and have it printed locally.</p>
<h3>The Book</h3>
<p>The idea for this book came to me when I was sitting on top of the ridge on the backside of the Anahola Mountains on Kauai.  I was there to ask permission for Jonathan and I to renew our wedding vows on top of the tallest peak, Kalalea.  The answer, of course, was of course!  And in that space of listening I heard Peter introduce himself and share his story.  This is the first in a series of children's books about kids connecting with a power animal.</p>
<h3>What does this mean?</h3>
<p>An animal totem often comes into our life when we are struggling with something or are just out of balance, like when we have been hyper focused on some issue and we see a majestic bald eagle flying overhead, reminding us to take a step back and look at the bigger picture.  Peter's friends have betrayed him at school, and he meets an owl in the forest behind his house that teaches him several lessons, including compassion for himself and the courage to face his friends.  This deals with the issues around bullying, and self confidence, as well as the real magic of nature connection.</p>
<h3>How You Can Help</h3>
<p>Ordering Peter and the Owl now means I can go ahead and have it printed and you will receive your signed copy by mid-January.  There is a slight chance that they will be able to complete the printing by Christmas, but I can't guarantee it for this campaign. </p>
<p>I am also offering a box of books at a deeper discount for those of you that would like to sell it through your store.</p>
<p>The book is written with elementary school aged kids in mind, but it's the kind of story that all ages will appreciate.  I'll be posting more updates with the actual story in the layouts as we prepare them for the printer.</p>
<p>My amazingly talented friend, Rachel Navarro, is helping me layout the book and prepare the files for the printer.  She has her own self-published children's book called <a href=""http://www.jellybeanandherbert.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Jellybean and Herbert"">Jellybean and Herbert</a>, in case you want to check it out!</p>
<p><br/>I couldn't do this without her help, and I definitely can't do this without YOUR help!  Do you know someone that would love this book?  Please share this with anyone you think may be interested!  Thank you so much for your continued support!</p>

I'm offering you a special dedication, global exposure in the entrepreneurial community, and a chance to invest in future entrepreneurs in return for helping me publish The Shareable Advertising Manual:

How will the $10,000 be spent?

Purchasing my remaining research, 
Taking time away from my desk to finish writing the manual, 
Hiring a professional editor to proofread the chapters.
Why are you writing The Shareable Advertising Manual?
Because nearly 50% of startups fail within the first 4 years due to:

inexperience
the entrepreneur loses hope
lack of market awareness
the entrepreneur falls in love with product/business
lack of clear focus
inadequate research and development
bad advice from family and friends
a bad product idea to begin with
wrongly anticipated costs
strategic marketing mistakes. (Source)
Two major problems are that many entrepreneurs and startups:

don't know how to build an effective branding strategy to anticipate and avoid failure and/or
don't have the budget to hire professional agencies to advise them. 
What makes The Shareable Advertising Manual unique:
Starting from scratch, The Shareable Advertising Manual takes you step-by-step through every aspect of a professionally-made branding strategy. It blends candid interviews with professionals from the advertising, public relations, law, and other industries with books, case studies, and research from behavioral economics, sociology, psychology and other related fields.
Included alongside the research are 400+ questions for you to answer that will become your complete professional branding strategy.
The Shareable Advertising Manual is ideal for small businesses who don't yet have the budget to hire professional advertising agencies, and the ideal introduction into the branding process for innovative and up-and-coming entrepreneurs.

It's 4 manuals in one: Branding, Advertising, Earned Media, Strategic Planning

It's predominantly psychologically-based, focusing on understanding your consumer and then building your brand upon those insights


It blends over 2 years of in-depth investigative research with candid interviews with award-winning creative directors, copywriters, strategic planners, and other experts from top agencies around the world such as Ogilvy, Y&R, HAVAS, TBWA, KBMG, AR NEW YORK as well as TED speakers to name a few.


It's 1,000s of professional advertising and branding tips, techniques, and advice.


It's written for startups and businesses who can't yet afford to hire professional agencies.


It's your branding strategy wrapped up in 400 questions.


It's solutions that matter to up-and-coming startups on a budget.

It asks all the questions you would ask the industry leading professionals if you had the opportunity to sit down with them and pick their brain over coffee for an hour.
Much, much more...

What do contributors get?
Depending on the contributor status you pledge at...
1.) Global exposure for your brand and a steady stream of new visitors to your website:

A permanent special dedication in the preface of EVERY edition of The Shareable Advertising Manual with your photo, website, name, and country.
A permanent special dedication on my website in the form of a 125x125 screenshot linking to your website along with a corresponding facebook like button.

<h3><em>About the Author</em></h3>
<p>I am a single Mom of a wonderful girl!  Born and raised in El Paso, Texas I had a wonderful childhood growing up in a colorful, creative, loud, crazy and funny Latino family full of great food, music and love.  Always positive, my family encouraged us creatively and with me, it was a huge impact on my life. </p>
<p>I studied and received a degree in Fashion Design and moved to Dallas to begin my creative goals.  I realized my dream of becoming  a fashion designer, however, in the back of my mind always wanted to do more and give more to the world.  I was greatly influenced by my daughter.  Raising her alone made me want to pass on the stories, culture, music and recipes I grew up with.</p>
<p>As the economy changed, I saw manufacturers close and businesses dissolve..the climate of design jobs and companies diminished when everything moved overseas, I needed to reinvent myself and keep positive.  I began telling my daughter stories of a character named Chulita and her friends.  This kept me positive and my daughter loved the stories. As the stories evolved, I started to develop and draw the characters.   I was excited to share my stories and wanted to share these books with the world, books that I wish I had when I was little  Characters that I could relate to.</p>
<div>
<h3><em>The Goal!</em></h3>
<p>I am in need of $2500.00 to complete the printing of this book.   I have been able to begin the process, but need help in getting the final printing done.  My ultimate goal is to build this into a brand.  With my background in design I have also designed bookmarks, posters, clothing, accessories and even toys based on the characters I have created!  All these are positive and fun influences for children.  I have also created several characters for future development of an animated series which I hope to produce once the books get off the ground!  These are all ideas in the works, but my books will be the first goal I would like to reach.</p>
<p>If I don't reach my entire goal, whatever I receive will go towards the printing of the first book in the Chulita series. Every little bit counts and no matter what you can give, it will be greatly appreciated!</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3><em>The Impact</em></h3>
<p>I truly believe this will be a positive catalyst for educators and parents. I would like to help lower the dropout rate for latinos in our communities and  feel that if parents  could read to their kids in English as their children are learning to read and speak English; they would be able to participate in the learning process with their young children.  An important part of school is how much parents are involved and I believe these books will truly make an impact. I also feel for English speaking kids and their families this will be a wonderful and fun learnng experience in a new language and culture! And while their kids are learning Spanish....so will they! Not only learning the language but learning about the Latin culture.</p>
</div>
<h3><em>Other Ways You Can Help</em></h3>
<p>Even if you cannot contribute ....you can still help!  Spread the word about these books to educators, parents and anyone you feel would help or be interested in this project!</p>

<p>My interest in lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) history began in my teens, at 15 years old, when I found a book called <i>Child of the Sun</i> tucked in a bag in my dad’s closet. This little book changed my life. It was a paperback novel about a Roman emperor named Elagabalus. This young man was only 14 when he became emperor and was just 18 when he died. The book was pretty racy, but it piqued my curiosity about his life.

<p></p></div>","The Cupbearers                              The Cupbearers features some of the most well documented gay relationships in ancient Greece, Rome and the Middle East. This book began as an illustrated project of my paintings, and developed into a collection of stories. Some of the paintings in The Cupbearers started out as an exhibition project called House of the Faun. Though these stories are factual, this is not academic gay history. It’s more creative nonfiction. I’ve found that most books written about gay history are scholarly and can be difficult to follow for the nonacademic reader. For that reason, I wanted to keep these adventures short and enjoyable.

For LGBT people, much of their history is hidden, manipulated or ignored. It’s important for this information to become mainstream. Many people, gay and straight, are unaware of the rich and varied heritage of the LGBT people, the numerous contributions they have made, and the crucial roles they have played in history. People struggling for equality draw strength from their shared culture, traditions and history. If we are to continue to change the future for LGBT people, we must also reclaim the past. Please help me to make my small contribution to re-envisioning LGBT history by supporting this project.Pre-order With Your Contribution Now!

Linda holds a Bachelor of Arts degree from Columbia College in Chicago where she double majored in Fine Art and Illustration. My Personal Story 
                    My name is Linda Larson, and I am the author and Illustrator of The Cupbearers.  In my lifetime I've witnessed the progression of modern gay history from Stonewall to Marriage Equality. While I love all kinds of history, my true passion is LGBT history in antiquity.
My interest in lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) history began in my teens, at 15 years old, when I found a book called Child of the Sun tucked in a bag in my dad’s closet. This little book changed my life. It was a paperback novel about a Roman emperor named Elagabalus. This young man was only 14 when he became emperor and was just 18 when he died. The book was pretty racy, but it piqued my curiosity about his life. While I searched in vain for information on him, I was drawn into the lives of other historical figures, and before I knew it, I became a full blown history nerd.                                                                     ElagabalusBack then it was difficult to find documented information about gay men and lesbians. So while concentrating on the mainstream history of the eras which interested me, I picked up some information about various artists and well-known people who were gay. With the advent of the Internet I was able to easily find historical sources about them. I also discovered many surprising and famous figures on gay history websites. Most of the names mentioned were people that I had always felt drawn to as well.
Unfortunately, I find that in mainstream history, the lives of great artists, writers, statesmen and kings are often portrayed inaccurately. Socrates, Alexander the Great, Richard the Lionhearted, Leonardo Da Vinci, and Michelangelo are just a few well-known figures who are often portrayed as heterosexual. Frequently, their homosexuality or bisexuality is ignored, while any whisper of heterosexuality, no matter how faint, is exploited. Even in mainstream media, this trend persists. Those who try to accurately portray the bisexuality of a great figure still face an onslaught of criticism and malice.Take Oliver Stone, for an example. When he attempted to portray Alexander the Great (accurately), as bisexual in his film Alexander, he was bitterly criticized for it. The Greek government refused to let him film his epic in Greece, while a band of Greek lawyers threatened a lawsuit against Warner Brothers if Stone portrayed Alexander as bisexual. There were many critics on the home front as well, and Stone was forced to cut homoerotic love scenes.  A year or so before the release of Alexander, a conference about Alexander in Greece was overrun by protestors and a speaker had to be removed by the local police.

Book Excerpt: Elagabalus and Hierocles
219 CE (AD)
The following excerpt from the book illustrates the remarkable meeting between the two youths that led to Hierocles’ incredible power.
                            On a sunny day in August, 219 CE, 15 year-old emperor Elagabalus was enjoying a day at the races. He was an avid fan of chariot racing, and loved to watch the Greens, his favorite team, compete in the Circus Maximus against the Blues, the Reds and the Whites. The races were exciting, and often deadly to the participants. The chariots, made of flimsy, lightweight wood that barely reached the charioteers’ waists, were built for speed, not safety. Powerful stallions were harnessed in pairs or fours and trained to gallop relentlessly around the sanded track. It took immense strength and skill for the charioteer to round the corners without spilling out. Those who fell were often trampled by the oncoming chariots. The rival teams, the Blues and Greens, were competing viciously on the track. Rounding the spina, the center of the track, a Green charioteer named Hierocles lost control and crashed his chariot in front of the imperial box. He was thrown into the air and landed directly across from where the emperor was sitting. The astonished emperor rose from his seat.

Among them:<br/><ul><li>At least one copy editor - I have a person who has agreed to do the bulk of the work for what I consider to be a very reasonable rate. She is a writing instructor at a college here in Santa Fe, holds a Master's Degree in Fine Arts, and she has offered me invaluable input and criticism on much of my recent work. Once the first draft is completed, I will send copies to various literary friends and acquaintances for further review and refinement.</li></ul><ul><li>A designer/layout consultant - The book cover and print layout are obviously extremely important to the book's potential acceptance into the literary community - it is the face on the body.

I am very impressed with his portfolio, which spans the past thirty years, and his suggestions so far have been eye-openers.</li></ul><ul><li>A printer - At this juncture, I have not decided whether to work through an online publisher, or to hire a local printer. I intend to balance the cost per copy with the quality of the finished product. Start-up funds are necessary to bring my collaborators and me to that decision - first things first.</li></ul><b>Promotion</b> - All artistic projects need a promotional budget. Future sales rely heavily upon websites, publications, reviewers, and small-press advocates whose  subsequent attention and glowing reviews will increase sales. I expect to have to comp and ship between 100 - 200 copies of the book. That costs money.<br/><p><b>An LLC</b> - I have future projects in mind, so I would like to make my small endeavor into something larger and self-sustainable. I will have to pay to register the  publishing company. I have a name for the company, but since it is not registered, I can't tell you just now.</p><p><b>Your Perks</b></p><ul>
<li>For a contribution of <b>$25 or more</b>, I will include, at the end of the book, a list of all contributors, no matter how many there are. After all, your financial support makes this book yours as well as mine, and I want all of our readers to see what advocates of the arts can achieve. You may also choose to make your contribution in someone else's name, having that person's name appear in the acknowledgments instead. If you choose to use a pseudonym, please keep it within the bounds of good taste.</li>
<li>For a <b>$100</b> donation, I will ship you a signed copy of ""The Story Tree."" (For those of you whom I know personally, I will try to include an individual message.) You also get the above acknowledgment.</li>
<li>Contributors of <b>$200 or more</b> will receive both the acknowledgment and s signed copy of the book, as well as a signed preview edition of the forthcoming Lost Crusaders CD, ""Near-Life Experience."" It is a full-length LP of new and unreleased songs, with some updated versions of your favorites from or first LP, ""Have You Heard About the World?"" It is being mastered and the artwork prepared, as you are reading this, and I can assure you that it is a terrific album.</li>

My audience is small, but dedicated, and the blog is followed by people in twenty-three countries on four continents.For my collection of stories, I have selected thirteen, which I feel are the most entertaining, compelling, and thought-provoking from my blog, as well as from my personal collection of stories and essays, which I have withheld, for just such a publication as, ""The Story Tree.""As a teaser, here is a link to where you can read two of the pieces which appear in ""The Story Tree."" (I'm not divulging the rest of them, but if you want to try to guess which ones by going to my blog, please remember that as they appear there, they are in raw, unedited form and may have typos, grammatical slips, etc.)http://thestorytreecollection.blogspot.com/FinancingAs any literary project must have financing, mine has expenses and requires the work of professionals who must be compensated for their time and effort. Among them:At least one copy editor - I have a person who has agreed to do the bulk of the work for what I consider to be a very reasonable rate. She is a writing instructor at a college here in Santa Fe, holds a Master's Degree in Fine Arts, and she has offered me invaluable input and criticism on much of my recent work. Once the first draft is completed, I will send copies to various literary friends and acquaintances for further review and refinement.A designer/layout consultant - The book cover and print layout are obviously extremely important to the book's potential acceptance into the literary community - it is the face on the body. Again, I have a Santa Fean who has been helping me along, and whom I intend to pay for his services. I am very impressed with his portfolio, which spans the past thirty years, and his suggestions so far have been eye-openers.A printer - At this juncture, I have not decided whether to work through an online publisher, or to hire a local printer. I intend to balance the cost per copy with the quality of the finished product. Start-up funds are necessary to bring my collaborators and me to that decision - first things first.Promotion - All artistic projects need a promotional budget. Future sales rely heavily upon websites, publications, reviewers, and small-press advocates whose  subsequent attention and glowing reviews will increase sales. I expect to have to comp and ship between 100 - 200 copies of the book. That costs money.An LLC - I have future projects in mind, so I would like to make my small endeavor into something larger and self-sustainable. I will have to pay to register the  publishing company. I have a name for the company, but since it is not registered, I can't tell you just now.Your Perks
For a contribution of $25 or more, I will include, at the end of the book, a list of all contributors, no matter how many there are. After all, your financial support makes this book yours as well as mine, and I want all of our readers to see what advocates of the arts can achieve. You may also choose to make your contribution in someone else's name, having that person's name appear in the acknowledgments instead. If you choose to use a pseudonym, please keep it within the bounds of good taste.
For a $100 donation, I will ship you a signed copy of ""The Story Tree."" (For those of you whom I know personally, I will try to include an individual message.) You also get the above acknowledgment.
Contributors of $200 or more will receive both the acknowledgment and s signed copy of the book, as well as a signed preview edition of the forthcoming Lost Crusaders CD, ""Near-Life Experience."" It is a full-length LP of new and unreleased songs, with some updated versions of your favorites from or first LP, ""Have You Heard About the World?"" It is being mastered and the artwork prepared, as you are reading this, and I can assure you that it is a terrific album.

$2000 and up - I will come read at your literary event (plus all of the above).

$5000 - I have not figured out to whom I'd like to dedicate ""The Story Tree."" For $5000, it's you or whomever you choose (plus all of the above, excluding the reading).",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

My name is Lauren Giammarco and I am the author of <i>The Unbecoming</i>. I wrote this book because I wanted to share my healing journey of full recovery from multiple chronic illnesses as a way to inspire and instill hope in those who are looking to heal themselves.<br/><br/>My hope is that in reading this book, you will discover the natural healing force within you: the greatest force in getting well. I hope to instill passion and excitement for reconnecting to our authentic selves through dismantling the thoughts and beliefs that prevent living authentically and feeling safe and supported. Ultimately, I want you to see this book as a tool to help gain clarity on the mind-body connection, and the power that already lies within to heal ourselves.<br/><br/>In this book, you'll learn about uncovering the messages hidden beneath our fear-based patterns that can keep us stuck from moving forward. You will learn about the power of intentional living. You'll hear stories such as...</p><p>How I overcame one of my greatest fears at 33,000 feet in the air through a chance encounter sitting next to a stranger.</p><p>How unresolved emotional abuse and trauma created perpetuating chronic symptoms and pain, and how I used the power of self-forgiveness to heal.</p><p>How a dome sitting in the middle of the Mojave Desert taught me the incredible life-changing power of a still mind.</p><p>You will love this book if you are on a healing journey and looking for inspiration on removing limiting beliefs, reconnecting to self through daily wellness practices, and understanding how to self-heal.<br/><br/><i>The Unbecoming</i> is a nonfiction book that speaks to those who are moving through chronic illness, going through their own self-awakening, or spiritual seekers who want a more intimate look into the mind and body connection.<br/> </p><p><strong>The Book - <i>The Unbecoming</i></strong></p><p>The book is written in three parts:<br/><br/>Part 1: <strong>Hidden Messages</strong> contains the Introduction and chapters 1-4. It uncovers four key themes - the mind body connection, curiosity, self-love, and fear. Within these chapters, I recount moments when I began to understand how emotional intelligence can truly change lives.<br/><br/>Part 2: <strong>Healing</strong> contains chapters 5-9. These chapters explore the four key elements that shifted my body into a healing state. These elements include the importance of rest and the fascinating science behind why we sleep, and how I changed my relationship with food, uncovered my values, and learned the power of forgiveness.<br/><br/>Part 3: <strong>The Awakening</strong> contains chapters 10-13. These chapters are the foundation for how I began to live in a way that supported the body and mind. I write transparently about learning to let go of past identities that no longer serve, how nature and mediation are proven healers, and lastly, how the importance of thriving, safe relationships help to sustain health and live authentically.</p><p><strong>What I Need &amp; What You'll Get</strong></p><p>This book will be published with New Degree Press.

</h3>
<p>Let's cut to the chase. In Canada, most writers survive by foraging for roots and berries.</p>
<p>And so, Jeremy Kroeker is raising money to record an audiobook version of his nationally best-selling book, ""Motorcycle Therapy - A Canadian Adventure in Central America."" (Although it will not likely be a major revenue stream, all sources of income are necessary for independent writers if they hope to sleep indoors year-round.)   </p>
<p>The goal is to have the audiobook ready for the Fall of 2013, when Kroeker's new book, ""Through Dust and Darkness,"" will be released (through publisher, Rocky Mountain Books).</p>
<h3>Now, who is this guy?</h3>
<p>Jeremy Kroeker is a freelance writer and speaker. With his motorcycle, he has traveled to over 30 countries while managing to do at least one outrageously stupid thing in every one. He has evaded police in Egypt, tasted teargas in Israel, scrambled through minefields in Bosnia and Lebanon, and wrangled a venomous snake in Austria. One time he got a sliver in El Salvador.</p>
<p>Since 1999, Kroeker has made his home in Canmore, Alberta. His writing has appeared in newspapers such as the Toronto Star, Winnipeg Free Press, Calgary Herald, and in magazines such as Alpinist, Westworld, Motorcycle Mojo Magazine, and Outrider Journal.</p>
<h3>Let's make this happen:</h3>
<p>To create an audiobook, Kroeker needs at least $3,000.</p>
<p>Most of this money will go to studio time and working with a professional audiobook producer. Another $1,000 or so will go into making C.D.'s (an outdated medium, we know, but necessary to have for promotion at motorcycle shows and rallies).</p>
<p>If fundraising goals are not met, the project will proceed anyway. It'll just hurt more.</p>
<p>If fundraising goals are exceeded, the money will be reinvested in the following ways:</p>
<p>1. Another print run of ""Motorcycle Therapy."" ($3,000, est.)</p>
<p>2. Website maintenance (what are all those blue quesion marks on MotorcycleTherapy.com?)</p>
<p>3. Falsetto audiobook. This is real. Although Kroeker may regret this pledge, if he should raise $9,000 through this campain, he will record a limited edition falsetto audiobook of ""Motorcycle Therapy."" He is confident (actually, he's quite smug about it) that this will not happen. If you want to humilliate this man, give generously.  </p>
<h3>What do I get?</h3>
<p>There are incentive packages! Small contributions receive copies of Motorcycle Therapy (eBooks, audiobooks, print books), while larger donations get cars. Well, one car, really. For a single contribution of $3,000, one lucky person can drive away in a rust-riddled 1996 Honda Civic Hatchback.</p>
<p>Of course, there are packages in between these two extremes. There are private slide shows and book events. You can even have your name read out in the acknowledgements for the audiobook version of Motorcycle Therapy.</p>
<h3>But I'm broke, too...</h3>
<p>No problem. Even if you can't make the smallest donation, you can still help. Kroeker needs this message to spread. Share the link and the video on Facebook or Twitter, etc.</p>
