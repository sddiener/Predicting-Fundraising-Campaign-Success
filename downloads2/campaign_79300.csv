<p><strong>Resumen</strong></p>
<p>¡Saludos Familia! </p>
<p>Me presento cordialmente, soy el cantautor Wally Martínez, directamente de mi pueblo montañoso de Corozal. Me dirijo a cada uno de ustedes porque en esta etapa de mi vida musical a de nacer mi 2da producción discográfica para el mes de junio 2017. Deseo extenderles una invitación personal para que sean parte de la misma mis amigos, familiares y seguidores.</p>
<p>La escena musical a sido parte de mi vida por los últimos 15 años aproximadamente y es una de esas cosas de las que no me arrepiento jamás. Conectar con el público es una de las pasiones más grandes que tengo la dicha de lograr en cada presentación. Para el 2013 tuve el honor de ver nacer mi primera producción con mi banda en ese entonces. Cuatro años después, me veo reflejado en mi guitarra con una nueva producción a realizar. En esta ocasión como solista…diseñando cada acorde y letra para lanzar “CALMA Y CAOS”, título que lleva la creación de este CD &amp;DVD.</p>
<p>Este proyecto a sido parte del resumen de mi vida y otras grandes experiencias que amigos y no tan amigos me han contado y se han hecho canción. He crecido como solista en los últimos tres años, y con el apoyo, afecto, y el talento de varios amigos y colegas músicos, los 9 temas con los que cuenta esta producción serán música.</p>
<p>Estos temas ya están completando su fase de arreglos para comenzar los ensayos con la banda y finalmente llegar a Spectrum Recording Studios, del ingeniero Francisco “Kiko” Hurtado, a finales de junio, para plasmar de manera “LIVE SESSION” todos los temas. Quiero regalarles una obra tanto sonora como visual. Con una banda bien complementada, nuestro ingeniero “Kiko”, y la filmación visual a cargo de PRODUCCIONES SERRUCHO, obtendremos un producto digno para ustedes.</p>
<p>Solo les pido que me brinden la confianza, que crean en las posibilidades de este proyecto, y que cada uno aporte un poco, ya sea con tan solo compartir este mensaje, para ver realizado este sueño.</p>
<p>Aquí desgloso lo que necesitamos y lo que obtienes por tu aportación</p>
<p><strong>La meta es alcanzar $10,000.00 para costear lo siguientes gastos de pre producción, producción y post producción:</strong></p>

<h3>Who Are We?</h3>
<p>Founded in 2015, All of the Above (AOTA) is a Cincinnati-based contemporary music ensemble that has since been featured in the Constella Festival, Music for All National Festival, Giovanni Vecchi Concert Series, The Cincinnati Art Museum Muse Concert Series, and the Music in the Gorno Library Concert Series. In addition to regular appearances at Classical Revolution Cincinnati, All of the Above has also performed at various Galas sponsored by Ohio Cancer Research and CityLink Center.</p>
<p>AOTA was announced as the Ensemble-in-Residence at Xavier University beginning in the fall of 2016. The ensemble’s performances at the University have since been included in the Music Department Concert Series. AOTA has also been involved in various ensemble coachings, recruiting of future music majors, masterclasses, and side-by-side performances with Xavier University students.  AOTA has been a next:generation ensemble with concert:nova since 2015. As part of this partnership and mentorship program, members of AOTA have been given the opportunity to perform alongside concert:nova artists while also participating in workshops covering various topics including interactive performances, marketing, non-profit education, and improvisation. </p>
<p>Recent commissions for AOTA involve collaborations with David Clay Mettens (Chicago), Allison Wright (Australia), Daniel Harrison (Cincinnati), and Sullivan Boecker (Cleveland). The ensemble’s upcoming engagements also include a recording project featuring the music of Douglas Knehans and Edward Smaldone on Ablaze records (Fall 2017).</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We are going to be using these funds to pay for airfare to get to Europe as well as aid in final festival payments. Even if you can only donate a couple of dollars, it'll go a long way to meeting our goal. In return for support, we are going to be offering personalized ""thank you's"" from Italy, rehearsal insights, lessons, and even house concerts!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This project is so important to us because it is our first opportunity to serve as an ensemble in residence at an international level. We feel that we have something really special to share with the new music community and believe this festival is going to help develop our creativity, artistry, and repertoire. One of the biggest benefits of serving as ensemble in residence is to provide young composers with an opportunity to realize their works in real time. We will get to see what weird sounds we like, which ones we hate, and create new works of music in real time. This is a big win-win for us and the composition fellows; they get to hone their craft, and we will bring back these living, breathing, works of art.</p>
<p>Any additional funding will go towards new commissions, future travel around the United States, and costs for establishing ourselves as a legal non-profit organization.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you cannot donate, it would mean the world to us if you shared this campaign with family, friends, coworkers, and other music lovers. We will be documenting our journey, rehearsals, and concerts throughout this process and will be sharing it all with you! </p>

<p>As many of you know, I am an independent artist meaning I have no label backing me and all of my work comes out of my own pocket.

Greetings everyone, my name is Decipha, I am a rapper based out of Chicago and this past October I dropped my EP entitled ""Thirty.""
What I am looking to do is raise support to shoot two music videos.

One for a song on Thirty entitled ""Coming Day"" dealing with some the social issues we are facing today. 
The other would go toward my new album due out after the new year entitled ""Deo Volente.""


What We Need & What You Get

I have already shot a the music video for ""Coming Day"" the cost for that video was $4,000, however we are also looking to shoot one more video costing us $2,400 within the same vain that encourages and even continues the conversation about the church's place in the world.
I am giving away free music, concert tickets, and t-shirts as well as a free download to the videos once they are complete.
I am teaming up with Golden Realm Productions who is helping me create high quality videos that I believe you will love to see.


The Impact
As many of you know, I am an independent artist meaning I have no label backing me and all of my work comes out of my own pocket. Therefore, the cost it takes to put out an album is more than just writing good lyrics, I spend most of my time thinking of unique ways to get it into your hands. 

This video project is geared to make people feel tension about what is happening in our cities across America. 
Some of us might already have some sense of the issues affecting our inner cities, however, it is often a trite step to tell someone living in an environment where it seems hopeless, that everything will be alright. Yet, what I am hoping these videos can do, is promote God's truth, that says, ""indeed in Christ everything is absolutely All Right!""


The Back Story
Just like everything, this project costs, again I am asking for your support financially to fund these two projects and also that you share with others who would be interested in funding as well.
I wrote the song ""Coming Day"" after multiple videos surfaced showing unarmed black individuals being gunned down by police. I was thinking of individuals who had no idea they were a targets and are dead today because they appeared to be threats despite evidence pointing the fact that they were not. For people who instead of being labeled men and women first and foremost, they are being shot based on suspicion and the song is for the voices of those we haven't heard from who even today are fighting against a system that oppresses people of color. Who look to God and wonder is the best you have for me.

<h3>HELP ME TO SHOW MY 2ND EP TO THE WORLD!</h3>
<p>My name is Leah and I've been writing songs, singing, and playing guitar since I was 11. The other year, I had the privilege of releasing my very first EP to the world! However, at this point I didn't have the equipment to do it all myself, so I had the help of my vocal coach (which was still incredible). BUT, now I have all my own equipment and have been working for over a year on these songs for this EP so I really want to release it in a way which is meaningful and worth it! Your kind donations can help this!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What exactly will I do with your money?</h3>
<p>Basically, to release music onto all the platforms and get physical copies made, it costs a lot of money. With this £500, I will be able to release my EP onto iTunes, Spotify, Amazon, GooglePlay and many other platforms! I will also be able to get 100 EP CDs made for you guys, with a booklet and artwork included!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>If I don't reach the full £500, I will still use the amount I get to go towards all of this! <u><strong>I ONLY ORIGINALLY WANTED £300 BUT INDIEGOGO SAID A MINIMUM OF £500</strong></u></p>
<h3>PERKS AND PRIZES!</h3>
<p>Depending on the amount you donate, you will be able to get something in return so that you don't feel like you're giving money for nothing! (And to express my gratitude for helping!) I'm still deciding on what exactly they will be, but it could include: a signed EP, handwritten lyrics, a gig whenever and wherever from myself and my guitar, all of these will also include a 'thank you' note specialised to you!!</p>
</div><div><h3>Spread the word! (Please)</h3></div><div>
<p>I understand some of you won't have the money to contribute, so if you don't then it would really mean a lot if you could just share my campaign to your Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, or just in person! (I believe you can use the Indiegogo sharing tools...)</p>

<li>In the U.S. 2.24 million+ bars, nightclubs, restaurants and live music venues showcase nearly one million artists every week.</li>
<li>GigGizmo™ will revolutionize how musicians and venues promote – fast, intuitive and affordable. Ultra easy for anyone to use.</li>

<li>Planned pricing: $12.95 per month, making it accessible to everyone who needs it.</li>

This web-based application was created from the desire to find an easier way to promote local shows, so it caters to the needs of those in the local live music scene.

That is precisely the place where 35% of live music lovers spend their time and money.</p><p>Another study found that most music goers get their show information from social media. More importantly, until now there were no promotional tools designed specifically to help those in the local live music industry reach their fans. In a $52 billion combined market, we know there is a viable opportunity for an intuitive tool that promotes local live music and makes it easy for fans to find local entertainment.</p><p>Q: <em>Don't other sites offer these services?</em><br/>A: Yes and no. Simply put, there is no one-stop-shop for this local live music niche. There are promotion tools available, however, they are scattered all over the place. Big music sites do offer some of the same services, but what and how they provide them varies. In the local live music industry, most of these sites have functionalities that are unneeded or simply not applicable. Moreover, getting pre-scheduled posts organized for multiple social media outlets requires the services of yet other providers.

It takes time to figure out which parts fit, both logistically and financially. A person must evaluate and cobble together the offerings of multiple sites to come up with something that works. For a local band, or small nightclub, it is all trial and error – in budget, strategy and know-how – when trying to navigate all the different services. Unfortunately, even after hundreds of hours of work, the desired goal to get show scheduling, social media marketing, and online content publishing down to a manageable process is almost always unmet.

<h3>Summary</h3>
<ul>
<li>Hello! My name is Greg. I am an independent musician based in San Diego, CA. <strong>THANK YOU</strong> for being here. I've spent over 15 years building towards the release of <strong>this </strong>album. In that process, I've recorded two prior projects with songs that I've been proud of, but did not have the team or the structure in place to really execute the full vision as an independent musician. With the team on this album, we've spent the last few years focused on building a recording studio, writing, recording, and working towards this independent release of our best work yet.</li>
<li>
<strong>YOU are a critical part of this team</strong>. This campaign brings us together to effectively create a record label. As a backer, you will help us to complete the recording process and distribute this music. </li>
<li>These songs are for the adventurers and dreamers in all of us. It is also for those who are digging through the day-in and day-out efforts of life seeking to discover more about themselves and persevering in pursuit of dreams. The lyrics seek to inspire introspection on how we can become all we were made to be.</li>
<li>Contributors will help this to be the largest independent release of my career and cap off a project over 3 years in the making with a large team of San Diego-based artists.</li>
<li>Through this campaign, the goal is to connect more directly with listeners and other artists through unique perks not regularly available. This includes sharing more than just the music, but also the meanings behind songs and tools to help enable other artists to create their own music.   </li>
</ul>
<h3>The Team</h3>
<p>This album has a core alternative rock sound. The songs also blend styles of blues, jazz, soul, and acoustic folk with some cinematic string arrangements and catchy melodies that use upbeat and mellow tempos. It's really diverse. <strong>Check out the 2nd video above to hear previews!</strong> To accomplish this album, there are some great musicians on these songs!

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Producing and releasing a record takes a lot of work and expense. We aim to complete this album and also make this process sustainable so we can put out more material in the future. Here it is in more detail:</p>
<p><strong>What we need:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>To pay session musicians, arrangers, mixing, and mastering engineers.</li>
<li>Recording equipment - We’ve slowly been building our own recording capability for years, but need to chip away in paying for equipment used to create the album. We've invested in our craft to create the vision we hear as professionally as we can while being independent artists.</li>
<li>Physical copies of the music, distribution, and digital services/marketing</li>
<li>To fund additional content to support the release of album, like production of music videos!</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What you'll get:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>You'll get the music (of course) before the official release date to the general public!</li>
<li>To be part of the excitement of an independent music release.</li>
<li>Unique perks! If you are a listener, you can get all of my music (not just this album), plus unreleased songs, and song meanings. Also, you have opportunities to connect and bundle content with unique experiences like personalized songs and private concerts.</li>
<li>If you are an artist and want to organize the creation and launch of your own music, there are some really awesome perks for you. I've spent <i>tons</i> of time working to be an ""independent label"". I would love to save you hours of time and effort and even have the chance to work with you in the studio.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact - Why am I doing this?</h3>
<ul><li>For me, you will be supporting a 15+ year journey building towards the release of the biggest music project that I have dreamed of. Music means a lot to me and I feel its impact has value, both personally and collectively. I’ve had albums help define times of joy and sadness, rest and work, inspiration and action. I’ve had songs help me to process an experience, to relate to God and to others. Some music has helped me get “unstuck” from a rut, personally and creatively. I strongly believe there is something for everyone on this album—whether it be inspiration, enjoyment, comfort, conviction, or epiphany. My hope is that this music can impact those things for others. I also love getting inspired and supporting the ""Dream it, Plan it, Do it"" mentality with others and hope you do too. I want to support others in that by contributing my art and providing practical resources for others to do the same. </li></ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>We've completed the earlier phases of the album creation, but there are still more critical steps for completing the album (like mastering), getting physical copies, distributing, and marketing. Independent artists rely on direct-to-fan support to make this happen.  </p>
<ul>
<li>If we don't meet our goals, this release will be very limited (limited physical copies, no marketing, limited  music video content, etc) and heavily impact the ability to record and release follow-up material at the same level we've worked on this album.</li>
<li>The goal is that your support now provides the ability to completely fund this album and build a foundational fan base to create the next one. Perhaps even a small tour. To accomplish this, we need to hit our launch goals on this album.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Stretch Goals</h3>
<ul>
<li>If we hit $11,500 we can get some tee shirts printed up - which would be awesome! We have some designs in mind.</li>
<li>If we hit $14,000 we can also get a limited run of vinyl albums pressed - which would be epic! </li>
</ul>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We truly appreciate and value your support, but if you can't contribute, no worries! Here are some other ways you can help:</p>
<ul>
<li>Get the word out on social media. You can use the Indiegogo share tools.</li>
<li>Tell your friends in person—old fashioned word of mouth!</li>

Hello! My name is Greg. I am an independent musician based in San Diego, CA. THANK YOU for being here. I've spent over 15 years building towards the release of this album. In that process, I've recorded two prior projects with songs that I've been proud of, but did not have the team or the structure in place to really execute the full vision as an independent musician. With the team on this album, we've spent the last few years focused on building a recording studio, writing, recording, and working towards this independent release of our best work yet.

YOU are a critical part of this team. This campaign brings us together to effectively create a record label. As a backer, you will help us to complete the recording process and distribute this music. 
These songs are for the adventurers and dreamers in all of us. It is also for those who are digging through the day-in and day-out efforts of life seeking to discover more about themselves and persevering in pursuit of dreams. The lyrics seek to inspire introspection on how we can become all we were made to be.
Contributors will help this to be the largest independent release of my career and cap off a project over 3 years in the making with a large team of San Diego-based artists.
Through this campaign, the goal is to connect more directly with listeners and other artists through unique perks not regularly available. This includes sharing more than just the music, but also the meanings behind songs and tools to help enable other artists to create their own music.   

The Team
This album has a core alternative rock sound. The songs also blend styles of blues, jazz, soul, and acoustic folk with some cinematic string arrangements and catchy melodies that use upbeat and mellow tempos. It's really diverse. Check out the 2nd video above to hear previews! To accomplish this album, there are some great musicians on these songs! It's been an honor to play with them.

What We Need & What You Get
Producing and releasing a record takes a lot of work and expense. We aim to complete this album and also make this process sustainable so we can put out more material in the future. Here it is in more detail:
What we need:

To pay session musicians, arrangers, mixing, and mastering engineers.
Recording equipment - We’ve slowly been building our own recording capability for years, but need to chip away in paying for equipment used to create the album. We've invested in our craft to create the vision we hear as professionally as we can while being independent artists.
Physical copies of the music, distribution, and digital services/marketing
To fund additional content to support the release of album, like production of music videos!

What you'll get:

You'll get the music (of course) before the official release date to the general public!
To be part of the excitement of an independent music release.
Unique perks! If you are a listener, you can get all of my music (not just this album), plus unreleased songs, and song meanings. Also, you have opportunities to connect and bundle content with unique experiences like personalized songs and private concerts.
If you are an artist and want to organize the creation and launch of your own music, there are some really awesome perks for you. I've spent tons of time working to be an ""independent label"". I would love to save you hours of time and effort and even have the chance to work with you in the studio.


The Impact - Why am I doing this?
For me, you will be supporting a 15+ year journey building towards the release of the biggest music project that I have dreamed of. Music means a lot to me and I feel its impact has value, both personally and collectively. I’ve had albums help define times of joy and sadness, rest and work, inspiration and action.

I want to support others in that by contributing my art and providing practical resources for others to do the same. 

Risks & Challenges
We've completed the earlier phases of the album creation, but there are still more critical steps for completing the album (like mastering), getting physical copies, distributing, and marketing. Independent artists rely on direct-to-fan support to make this happen.  

If we don't meet our goals, this release will be very limited (limited physical copies, no marketing, limited  music video content, etc) and heavily impact the ability to record and release follow-up material at the same level we've worked on this album.
The goal is that your support now provides the ability to completely fund this album and build a foundational fan base to create the next one. Perhaps even a small tour. To accomplish this, we need to hit our launch goals on this album.


Stretch Goals

If we hit $11,500 we can get some tee shirts printed up - which would be awesome! We have some designs in mind.
If we hit $14,000 we can also get a limited run of vinyl albums pressed - which would be epic!

<h3>A Letter from Garrison Evans</h3>
<p>Hello friends, family, and music supporters!</p>
<p>My name is Garrison Evans and I'm an electronic indie-pop singer/songwriter from Englewood, CO currently studying at Berklee College of Music. My fascination for the creative arts has always been evident. Listening to music was one thing, but creating it and feeling it come out of me was a completely different sensation. Music was always a support system for me and I knew that there would be people out there going through the same struggles as I am, and that the predominant way I got through it was through music. I want to tell the stories that are reluctant to be told. I want my music to be an abstract medicine. I want those who listen to know that they're not alone in their experiences. I want to make people think and analyze the world around them and eventually find solace and catharsis.</p>
<p>I have had the amazing opportunity to be surrounded by inspirational and motivational people that have encouraged me to create and release my first EP. With that, I created an amazing team to help me with this project. I hired an amazing manager, Caroline Carlson, an extremely talented producer, Matt Browning, and some amazing instrumentalists. These people have contributed so much of their time to help with the vision of the EP.</p>
<p>Exposing my art creates a rush inside of me and I have a gut feeling that my hard work is going to pay off no matter how big or small the audience is. I’m not making music to show off my voice or to go from rags to riches. I’m making music to tell stories that so desperately need to be told. I get to relate, connect, and heal others the way that music has healed me, and that feeling is truly amazing. By donating, you can help me reward the amazing producer I have on board and help me reach this goal I've had for as long as I can remember.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>How Your Donation Can Help</h3>
<p>Making an EP is not cheap if you want it to reach it's full potential. Recording an EP requires many vital steps: production, mixing, mastering, instrumentalists, etc. I found an amazing producer to help bring my artistic vision to life, and they deserve to be compensated for their hard work. We've been hard at work in the studio all summer perfecting each song for this record. If we reach our goal, the majority of the money will go towards his production, mixing, and mastering. </p>
<p>Along with the production of the EP, there are also a few other aspects that we would like to invest in. This EP is set to release before the year ends, and there are a few processes we have to go through in order to make that happen. These include registering each song for copyright, distribution, and merchandise. Any exceeding funds will go towards those three processes and the future of my music. Creating a fundraising campaign was a great way for me to share my music and artistic vision, and I hope you consider donating!</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div><h3>What You Get</h3></div><div><p>Your contribution to this project is extremely meaningful to me and I cannot thank you enough if you donate, and your generosity will not go unnoticed. Listed on the right are the gifts I'd like to offer you for donating. Each donation amount comes with a ""Perk.""

<h2>What's this all about?</h2>
<p>I can't thank you enough for your interest in my new release, <i>Shades of Blue</i>. Your time and consideration really does make all of this mean something. For those who don't know me, I'm an acoustic singer-songwriter from Saugerties, NY. I've been writing songs since I was ten years old and have never strayed, and never really wanted to do anything else.  I've always wanted to be able to share my perspective with people, and music is how I do that best. This album is a really transparent commentary on aspects of my life over the past two years, of up's and down's that I believe are relatable since we're all connected in this life.  My goal is to try and make you feel that for a moment.</p>
<p>This album process began last year. I went into the studio with eight songs, for eight days, and came out with three—that still were a ways away from being finished... a crazy, daunting, learning experience for me. During those eight days, I saw how much I had to learn and readjusted my strategy. Being completely tapped of energy, and money, I realized I needed to go deeper into music in every way and partnered up with the very talented Ayla Rector. So, we started an LLC called Nightcap Entertainment. Our focus is on all aspects of the music industry for myself and other independent, original artists. I  worked two jobs and gigged while rewriting the album to get back to the studio, while Ayla took care of the bookings, filming, and management—I love her for staying by my side even though I get myself into crazy debt, and sticky situations at times—but we really do love what we're doing.</p>
<p>The news of my engineer, Dave, moving across the country seemed like a hitch at the time. He accepted the position of Head Engineer at the revitalized, legendary recording studio: Sound City in LA. At first I was afraid I'd have to find a replacement, until he convinced me otherwise. Next thing I knew I was in LA recording vocals in studio A. Dave and I have been making music together for nearly 8 years now and I believe Shades Of Blue is our best sounding record to date. </p>
<p>Studio days are long. For Dave and I they last fourteen hours on average. Dave is a machine and I do my best to keep up—until I inevitably just, stare at walls. The final night of the recording session we mixed until our ears went silent and packed up for the six AM flight back home. I couldn't tell if the music was good anymore. And there was no time to relax; after a day of sleep it was right back to work. </p>
<p>In retrospect, it's amazing to me how much time, money, and love I've spent on this album. What is not amazing is how hard I believe in good audio, thoughtful lyrics, and passionate musicians. This album is a product of all of that. I'm so grateful for this process and everyone who was a part of it. Especially you, thank you—more than I can express here—for your contribution. </p>

<h3>Hope Rocks Festival Fundraiser</h3>
<p>One of our main focuses in our business, Nightcap Entertainment LLC, is local community. I've put together a fundraiser for Hope Rocks music festival, founded by Joe Defino. Hope Rocks is about raising awareness for addiction and how a community can help bring new life to each other. I myself am over a year sober and these kinds of festivals mean a lot to me. Joe puts on most of these festivals out of pocket. Any contribution will help to ensure that these initiatives continue as annual events. Thank you again.</p>

<h3>Are there perks?</h3>
</div><div>
<p>So, this is a pre-order, which means any monetary support you give, you'll get back in product form. Everything is already made, or in the process as we speak—it's just waiting for the right home. I really wanted to show my investment by producing the album and the merch before I did any fundraising. I don't believe in talking about something before it has come to fruition.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1497555257/jnlaa5djfprzws7prqjy.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">There are some really cool pre-order options. I'm excited to see what you're into. I tried to create an option for everyone. There are some weird options, in-between options, some basic options, and some extreme options... for the risk takers like myself! Every option is awesome in my mind, anything you guys want to invest in is the best.</p>
<p>You contributing to this pre-order means:</p>
<ul>
<li>another album</li>
<li>more shows</li>
<li>the legitimization of an independent artist</li>
<li>If I reach my goal, you are supporting a bigger picture idea. One that believes in independent artists making their own way.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h2>The Impact</h2>
<p>This album is the first big step up for me. Good quality audio and content, is the only resume a musician has. The music world isn't a career, it is a way of life, and it takes everything to succeed. The good thing is you can distribute an album, and that is where the recognition comes in. You matter the most in the music industry. You are the ones getting the passion out there. I hope to help fuel myself through a successful campaign, so I can in turn, help others do the same. I just want to see musicians I believe in succeed. Because the music industry is so capitalized, there is no breathing room for independent musicians. They need support, just like I do. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>All pre-orders placed, will be fulfilled by me. I will be sending out a big one-time order of products. The day after the campaign ends is going to be crazy for me, but I'll do my best to get everything to you as soon as humanly possible. Please allow for a week of flex time, after the campaign ends, before you receive your perks. </p>
<p>This is the first time I'm doing this, so it's all new to me. Always feel free to reach out with requests, or questions. I'm really hoping to make a successful model for the future, and any input from you is very valuable.

The news of my engineer, Dave, moving across the country seemed like a hitch at the time. He accepted the position of Head Engineer at the revitalized, legendary recording studio: Sound City in LA. At first I was afraid I'd have to find a replacement, until he convinced me otherwise. Next thing I knew I was in LA recording vocals in studio A. Dave and I have been making music together for nearly 8 years now and I believe Shades Of Blue is our best sounding record to date. 
Studio days are long. For Dave and I they last fourteen hours on average. Dave is a machine and I do my best to keep up—until I inevitably just, stare at walls. The final night of the recording session we mixed until our ears went silent and packed up for the six AM flight back home. I couldn't tell if the music was good anymore. And there was no time to relax; after a day of sleep it was right back to work. 
In retrospect, it's amazing to me how much time, money, and love I've spent on this album. What is not amazing is how hard I believe in good audio, thoughtful lyrics, and passionate musicians. This album is a product of all of that. I'm so grateful for this process and everyone who was a part of it. Especially you, thank you—more than I can express here—for your contribution. 

Hope Rocks Festival Fundraiser
One of our main focuses in our business, Nightcap Entertainment LLC, is local community. I've put together a fundraiser for Hope Rocks music festival, founded by Joe Defino. Hope Rocks is about raising awareness for addiction and how a community can help bring new life to each other. I myself am over a year sober and these kinds of festivals mean a lot to me. Joe puts on most of these festivals out of pocket. Any contribution will help to ensure that these initiatives continue as annual events. Thank you again.

Are there perks?

So, this is a pre-order, which means any monetary support you give, you'll get back in product form. Everything is already made, or in the process as we speak—it's just waiting for the right home. I really wanted to show my investment by producing the album and the merch before I did any fundraising. I don't believe in talking about something before it has come to fruition.


 
There are some really cool pre-order options. I'm excited to see what you're into. I tried to create an option for everyone. There are some weird options, in-between options, some basic options, and some extreme options... for the risk takers like myself! Every option is awesome in my mind, anything you guys want to invest in is the best.
You contributing to this pre-order means:

another album
more shows
the legitimization of an independent artist
If I reach my goal, you are supporting a bigger picture idea. One that believes in independent artists making their own way.


The Impact
This album is the first big step up for me. Good quality audio and content, is the only resume a musician has. The music world isn't a career, it is a way of life, and it takes everything to succeed. The good thing is you can distribute an album, and that is where the recognition comes in. You matter the most in the music industry. You are the ones getting the passion out there. I hope to help fuel myself through a successful campaign, so I can in turn, help others do the same. I just want to see musicians I believe in succeed. Because the music industry is so capitalized, there is no breathing room for independent musicians. They need support, just like I do. 

Risks & Challenges
All pre-orders placed, will be fulfilled by me. I will be sending out a big one-time order of products. The day after the campaign ends is going to be crazy for me, but I'll do my best to get everything to you as soon as humanly possible. Please allow for a week of flex time, after the campaign ends, before you receive your perks. 
This is the first time I'm doing this, so it's all new to me. Always feel free to reach out with requests, or questions. I'm really hoping to make a successful model for the future, and any input from you is very valuable. Please visit my website: www.ianflaniganmusic.com and shoot me an email ianflaniganbooking@gmail.com (also be sure to subscribe).

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>We are the Smokin' Armadillos.  Six guys from Bakersfield, California with a quirky name, a little musical talent, and a great deal of passion for making music together.  </p>
<p>It started for us after high school (and during high school for one of us), when we stepped into a local recording studio with 5 songs and $3,000 to make a CD to sell at our shows.  Before long, things took off and we sold over 150,000 copies of our first EP.  Within two years of our first show, we signed a record deal with a major label out of Nashville, and hit the road.  We saw hundreds of thousands of you around the country, and had a great time making music, recording and performing.  But all things must come to an end, and as life happened, we eventually closed our doors and went home to raise our kids, pursue new ventures and get real jobs.   </p>
<p>Fast forward a few years, and the six of us get together one night for dinner, to have a few laughs, share some memories and somehow, start the wheels turning again.  Wouldn't it be fun to do one more show? Maybe write a few new songs?  Maybe even record a couple?  But what if we could do a little more...just for fun?</p>
<p><u><strong>So that brings us to what we're doing today.</strong></u>  We've spent the last couple of years writing and recording what we believe is the best stuff we've ever done.  Now I'm sure every band thinks their latest stuff is the best stuff they've ever done, but ours actually is...no really.  Well, whether it is or not, we think it's pretty good and we want people out there to have a chance to hear it.  <u>We have a new single ready to hit radio starting September 25, and it's a song called <i>The Other California</i>.</u>  We managed to record and mix all of this project on our own, but getting it to radio, and getting them to play it, is a whole different monster.  That's where you come in. We figured since you guys were the legs that carried our music before (you are a force to be reckoned with!), why reinvent the wheel?</p>
<p><u><strong>So what's the goal here and how does it effect you?</strong></u>  Let's be honest...we don't need a record deal (been there, done that), we don't need fame and fortune.  We love making music together and we love getting to share it.  We love and miss the interaction we got to have with all of you over the years, and well, we're just not ready to give it up quite yet.  What we want is a chance to share our music with as many people around the country, and the world, as we can.  Every dime you donate will go to promoting that music, whether through radio promoters, social media, videos, and whatever else we can find.  And we have what we think is some pretty cool stuff to give you just for being a part of it.</p>
<p><u><strong>How will we spend your money?</strong></u>  At the minimum ($4,500), we will use it to pay for startup costs, the mastering and production of CD singles, and distributing that to radio stations around the country.  If we raise more ($8,500 to $12,500), we will hire secondary market promoters that push for airplay in smaller markets around the country.  If we raise more than that ($18,000 to $30,000), we will hire promoters to work the larger markets around the country.  If we raise more than that (????), the push gets bigger until we have every country station in the U.S. playing it, or we die trying!  If there is enough success, there will be a second single and we'll use any left over money to start the promotion for it after the first one is done...we've already got it recorded.  In fact, we've got an album full of songs recorded that we will be releasing one or two at a time over the next year if you want to hear them.</p>
<p><i>So at very least</i>, we hope you join us and spread the word, throw in a few dollars and get yourself a nice little Armadillo something or other, and enjoy the new music we've been working on for the last few years.  We can't promise a number one, or airplay in every station in the country, but stranger things have happened.  We can guarantee that we will release a new single shortly, and we promise it's going to be a good time getting it out!</p>
<p>Thanks so much and lots of love!!!</p>

</div></div>","Our Story
We are the Smokin' Armadillos.  Six guys from Bakersfield, California with a quirky name, a little musical talent, and a great deal of passion for making music together.  
It started for us after high school (and during high school for one of us), when we stepped into a local recording studio with 5 songs and $3,000 to make a CD to sell at our shows.  Before long, things took off and we sold over 150,000 copies of our first EP.  Within two years of our first show, we signed a record deal with a major label out of Nashville, and hit the road.  We saw hundreds of thousands of you around the country, and had a great time making music, recording and performing.  But all things must come to an end, and as life happened, we eventually closed our doors and went home to raise our kids, pursue new ventures and get real jobs.   
Fast forward a few years, and the six of us get together one night for dinner, to have a few laughs, share some memories and somehow, start the wheels turning again.  Wouldn't it be fun to do one more show? Maybe write a few new songs?  Maybe even record a couple?  But what if we could do a little more...just for fun?
So that brings us to what we're doing today.  We've spent the last couple of years writing and recording what we believe is the best stuff we've ever done.  Now I'm sure every band thinks their latest stuff is the best stuff they've ever done, but ours actually is...no really.  Well, whether it is or not, we think it's pretty good and we want people out there to have a chance to hear it.  We have a new single ready to hit radio starting September 25, and it's a song called The Other California.  We managed to record and mix all of this project on our own, but getting it to radio, and getting them to play it, is a whole different monster.  That's where you come in. We figured since you guys were the legs that carried our music before (you are a force to be reckoned with!), why reinvent the wheel?
So what's the goal here and how does it effect you?  Let's be honest...we don't need a record deal (been there, done that), we don't need fame and fortune.  We love making music together and we love getting to share it.  We love and miss the interaction we got to have with all of you over the years, and well, we're just not ready to give it up quite yet.  What we want is a chance to share our music with as many people around the country, and the world, as we can.  Every dime you donate will go to promoting that music, whether through radio promoters, social media, videos, and whatever else we can find.  And we have what we think is some pretty cool stuff to give you just for being a part of it.
How will we spend your money?  At the minimum ($4,500), we will use it to pay for startup costs, the mastering and production of CD singles, and distributing that to radio stations around the country.  If we raise more ($8,500 to $12,500), we will hire secondary market promoters that push for airplay in smaller markets around the country.  If we raise more than that ($18,000 to $30,000), we will hire promoters to work the larger markets around the country.  If we raise more than that (????), the push gets bigger until we have every country station in the U.S. playing it, or we die trying!  If there is enough success, there will be a second single and we'll use any left over money to start the promotion for it after the first one is done...we've already got it recorded.  In fact, we've got an album full of songs recorded that we will be releasing one or two at a time over the next year if you want to hear them.
So at very least, we hope you join us and spread the word, throw in a few dollars and get yourself a nice little Armadillo something or other, and enjoy the new music we've been working on for the last few years.  We can't promise a number one, or airplay in every station in the country, but stranger things have happened.  We can guarantee that we will release a new single shortly, and we promise it's going to be a good time getting it out!

<h3>""Written in the Parking Lot""</h3>
<p>This project is about releasing some of the best songs I have ever written. Songs about real life, struggles, battles, love, and loss. Since the release of my last album, I have had a multitude of life experiences that I have put to song. From Addiction to loss, it's in there. I have poured my heart out on this album and I know you will find a message that you can relate to in these songs. This album is for all the people that have supported me over the years.  I am looking for you all to be a part of the album.</p>

(THANK YOU TO ALL THAT SUPPORTED ME!!) But I was not writing like I used to and was drinking a lot. Fast forward a couple years, I got sober and music started to flow with me again.

<div><p><strong>Short Summary</strong></p></div>
<p>My name is Hyeseon Hong and I’m a composer from Seoul, South Korea. I’m launching this campaign to raise money for the final stages of my recording project entitled “Ee-Ya-Gi” which is a Korean word that means “Stories”.  Your support will have an enormous impact on this project, ensuring that it will come to life and be heard by as many people as possible.  Your contribution to this music will take me one step close to achieving my dream. I sincerely thank you for taking the time to learn about my stories.</p>
<p>안녕하세요. <br/>홍혜선 재즈 오케스트라로 뉴욕에서 연주 활동을 하고 있는 작곡자 홍혜선입니다.<br/>곧, 제  일곱곡을 실은 앨범 ""이야기""(Ee Ya Gi )가 출시될 예정입니다.<br/>제 음악은 한국의 리듬(장단)과 정서, 클래식 음악과 합창곡들의 영향을 받았으며, 이 앨범을 위해 뉴욕 최고의 연주자들과 특히, 세계적인 색소폰 주자 리치 페리와 트럼펫 주자 잉그리드 젠슨이 앨범녹음에 참여했습니다.<br/>연세대 졸업과 뉴욕 유학후, 홍혜선 앙상블로 뉴욕에서의 활동을 시작했습니다.                                                              귀국후,국내에서의 몇년을 대학에서 후배양성과 홍혜선 앙상블, 홍혜선콰이어를 통하여 작곡자와 편곡자로 활발히 활동하던중,  저의 궁국적인 꿈인 재즈오케스트라로의 활동을 위해 뉴욕으로 돌아와 밴드의 리더와 작곡자로서의 career를 쌓아나가고 있습니다<br/>재즈 앨범 제작과 판매의 후원들이 척박한가운데서도 새로운 음악에로의 아티스트들의 도전은 계속 되듯이 저의 도전도 계속 될 것입니다.<br/>앨범의 중요부분은 끝났지만 나머지 몇 스텝들의 (마스터링, 인쇄, 디자인, 유통, 홍보) 경비를 충당하기 위해 펀드레이징을 합니다. 관심있는 여러분들이 미리 앨범을 구입하시거나, 도네이트 또는 Social Network에 share해주시면 대단히 감사하겠습니다.</p>
<p>I originally came to New York City to study jazz composition at NYU. I started writing music for my own 10 piece band as a student and this ensemble continued to expand, growing larger and larger. We began gigging around the city for a few years before opportunities took me back to Korea. When I arrived in Seoul, I quickly became busy teaching college classes and performing with my other projects. But I missed the creative and vibrant music scene in NYC even though I returned from time to time to perform.  Finally, I had to decide where I really wanted to be based, and the choice for me was clear. I decided to come back to NYC to accomplish my dream of writing and playing with my own orchestra. Out of this dream the album “Ee-Ya-Gi” was born.</p>
<p>The album already sounds amazing. Recorded at Bunker Studio and engineered by Aaron Nevezie the band spent two wonderful days in the studio laying down my compositions. I brought together an amazing group of NYC musicians and featured world-renowned saxophonist Rich Perry and trumpeter Ingrid Jensen. I returned to the studio to do some careful editing, and we spent several days in the studio mixing the music to perfection.</p>
<p>But there are still many final steps that need to be taken to get this music out to the world. And that is where you come in! Your contribution will really make a difference and I have some great rewards to offer you in exchange for your support. </p>
<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<p>So here’s the break down and budget of this project. With my own savings I managed to fund two days at the studio, along with a couple days of editing, and two full days of mixing. I was also able to compensate the 18 musicians for their amazing playing and musicianship (they all gave me a huge break on the price showing their belief in this project!)</p>
<p> But there are still so many things that need to be funded and done correctly so that this project doesn’t just remain buried on a hard drive. And that’s where your contribution will come into play. These are the remaining items I need to get this project out there:</p>
<p><strong>1. Mastering:</strong> $1500 to give the recording that sweet sound that it deserves</p>
<p><strong>2. Replicating and manufacturing:</strong> $1500 to create the actual disk for you to posses and enjoy</p>
<p><strong>3. Graphic design:</strong> $1000 to help visually represent my musical vision</p>
<p><strong>4. Album promotion:</strong> $3000 which includes both radio and print media campaign to get it out there</p>
<p>So I’m seeking to raise a <strong>total of $7000</strong> to complete these final steps and to make this recording a reality. In exchange for your contribution, I have created some unique and valuable rewards for you. I have gone into greater detail in the rewards section of this campaign. But a few highlights include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<i>Autographed CDs and digital downloads before the official release date:</i> this will be great because you will have a chance to hear the music before the rest of the world.</li>
<li>
<i>Uniquely designed poster featuring album images of this project:</i> I’m really excited about this one! The poster will feature pictures from the recording session and gigs as well as album art work. I’ll have a few specially signed by the members of the band.</li>
<li>
<i>Special hand painted Korean calligraphy art work:</i> This is printed on beautiful paper brought here from Korea. These works look great when placed in a frame and hung on the wall as a decoration.</li>
<li>
<i>VIP tickets to upcoming performance of the Hyeseon Hong Jazz Orchestra:</i> While we haven’t yet finalized the date, when we do you will have special guest passes for 2 to attend this amazing event! It will be a fabulous evening for sure.</li>
</ul>
<p>An important note regarding my choice to make this the kind of campaign that will use whatever money is contributed: I will make sure that the first monies received will go directly towards getting the recording finished. If I do not receive all of the funds, I spend less on design and promotion to ensure that I am still able to fulfill all rewards as promised. </p>
<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<p>I wanted to go into a little more detail about why I think this project is important, tell you a bit more about my music and where it was recorded, and to introduce the musicians to you.  My compositions blend elements of classical music, modern jazz big band and Korean traditional music.  Featuring strong melodies with harmonically-rich, impressionistic backgrounds, my music strives to paint a picture of the natural world in the listener's mind.   I also want to share the uniqueness of my Korean cultural experience with others, raising awareness of both the differences and similarities between the east and the west.  I want to foster musical dialogue which will lead to better understanding and communication.</p>
<p>While there are a variety of big bands performing in NYC these days, I believe my music offers a unique and original take on this particular instrumentation.  The ensemble itself is filled with some of the best jazz musician’s NYC has to offer. Many of the musicians performing in my group can be found in some of the best big bands throughout the world. Special guest soloist Rich Perry brings his multi-decades of experience playing in the Maria Schneider Jazz Orchestra as well as with the Village Vanguard big band to this project. Rich can be heard on countless recordings as both a sideman and leader. Special guest trumpet soloist Ingrid Jensen also joins the ensemble for this recording playing section parts as well as lending her improvisational voice to Ms. Hong's compositions. Ingrid is a world famous performer appearing in The Maria Schneider Jazz Orchestra, Darcy James Argue’s Secret Society and on countless other projects as both a leader and sideman.</p>
<p>The album was recorded at Bunker Studio located in Brooklyn.  The Bunker Studio is a 3000 square foot recording studio in Williamsburg, Brooklyn NYC that is owned and operated by producer/musicians John Davis and Aaron Nevezie. Committed to preserving the art and science of analog recording and mixing, they understand the needs of musicians in terms of sound, space, and sightlines. With exceptional microphones, recording gear, and instruments, Bunker Studio offers the perfect environment to record a large ensemble of this size.  </p>
<p>The album will be mastered by Randy Merrill at Sterling Sound. Randy Merrill’s approach to mastering starts by understanding what a recording needs in order to have maximum translatability, musicality, and impact.</p>
<p>The album is going to be released May 12th 2017 on Summit Records.  Summit Records is an internationally renowned record label, with many well-known recording artists on their roster and numerous Grammy awards under their belt.  Summit believes this particular recording has a great chance at a Grammy nomination. They will also be doing a national and international radio campaign utilizing Dr. Jazz for the radio promotion.</p>
<p><strong>Risks &amp; Challenges</strong></p>
<p>The biggest challenge to releasing this recording, and actually any recording these days, is getting the music heard in the crowded marketplace of the internet. There is no longer one central place where everyone goes to find music. I believe many people would enjoy and cherish the music found on this recording, but they simply may never come across it. Increasingly algorithms choose the music that will show up as suggested new music for you, and it takes a lot for me to make sure my music gets equal consideration!</p>
<p>In order to overcome this challenge I’ve put in place a great team of people to help me spread the word.  Summit Records is helping immensely.  Dr. Jazz will be coordinating a radio campaign. And hopefully this crowd funding campaign will launch awareness about the upcoming release. And I hope if you value this kind of project and music that YOU will help me spread the word!  I think once given a chance, the strength of the recording will shine through. The musicians really rose to the occasion and made my music sound great.</p>
<p><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></p>
<p>Even if you can't contribute financially at this time to this campaign, it would mean a lot to me if you could help me spread the word about my project! Indiegogo has a lot of easy share tools that you can use to share my project on Facebook, Twitter, on your own blog, website or anywhere else. If you value this kind of music, share it with your friends and family! </p>
<p>Thank you very much and I hope to see you soon!</p>

My name is Hyeseon Hong and I’m a composer from Seoul, South Korea. I’m launching this campaign to raise money for the final stages of my recording project entitled “Ee-Ya-Gi” which is a Korean word that means “Stories”.  Your support will have an enormous impact on this project, ensuring that it will come to life and be heard by as many people as possible.  Your contribution to this music will take me one step close to achieving my dream. I sincerely thank you for taking the time to learn about my stories.
안녕하세요. 홍혜선 재즈 오케스트라로 뉴욕에서 연주 활동을 하고 있는 작곡자 홍혜선입니다.곧, 제  일곱곡을 실은 앨범 ""이야기""(Ee Ya Gi )가 출시될 예정입니다.제 음악은 한국의 리듬(장단)과 정서, 클래식 음악과 합창곡들의 영향을 받았으며, 이 앨범을 위해 뉴욕 최고의 연주자들과 특히, 세계적인 색소폰 주자 리치 페리와 트럼펫 주자 잉그리드 젠슨이 앨범녹음에 참여했습니다.연세대 졸업과 뉴욕 유학후, 홍혜선 앙상블로 뉴욕에서의 활동을 시작했습니다.                                                              귀국후,국내에서의 몇년을 대학에서 후배양성과 홍혜선 앙상블, 홍혜선콰이어를 통하여 작곡자와 편곡자로 활발히 활동하던중,  저의 궁국적인 꿈인 재즈오케스트라로의 활동을 위해 뉴욕으로 돌아와 밴드의 리더와 작곡자로서의 career를 쌓아나가고 있습니다재즈 앨범 제작과 판매의 후원들이 척박한가운데서도 새로운 음악에로의 아티스트들의 도전은 계속 되듯이 저의 도전도 계속 될 것입니다.앨범의 중요부분은 끝났지만 나머지 몇 스텝들의 (마스터링, 인쇄, 디자인, 유통, 홍보) 경비를 충당하기 위해 펀드레이징을 합니다. 관심있는 여러분들이 미리 앨범을 구입하시거나, 도네이트 또는 Social Network에 share해주시면 대단히 감사하겠습니다.
I originally came to New York City to study jazz composition at NYU. I started writing music for my own 10 piece band as a student and this ensemble continued to expand, growing larger and larger. We began gigging around the city for a few years before opportunities took me back to Korea. When I arrived in Seoul, I quickly became busy teaching college classes and performing with my other projects. But I missed the creative and vibrant music scene in NYC even though I returned from time to time to perform.  Finally, I had to decide where I really wanted to be based, and the choice for me was clear. I decided to come back to NYC to accomplish my dream of writing and playing with my own orchestra. Out of this dream the album “Ee-Ya-Gi” was born.
The album already sounds amazing. Recorded at Bunker Studio and engineered by Aaron Nevezie the band spent two wonderful days in the studio laying down my compositions. I brought together an amazing group of NYC musicians and featured world-renowned saxophonist Rich Perry and trumpeter Ingrid Jensen. I returned to the studio to do some careful editing, and we spent several days in the studio mixing the music to perfection.
But there are still many final steps that need to be taken to get this music out to the world. And that is where you come in! Your contribution will really make a difference and I have some great rewards to offer you in exchange for your support. 
What We Need & What You Get
So here’s the break down and budget of this project. With my own savings I managed to fund two days at the studio, along with a couple days of editing, and two full days of mixing. I was also able to compensate the 18 musicians for their amazing playing and musicianship (they all gave me a huge break on the price showing their belief in this project!)
 But there are still so many things that need to be funded and done correctly so that this project doesn’t just remain buried on a hard drive. And that’s where your contribution will come into play. These are the remaining items I need to get this project out there:
1. Mastering: $1500 to give the recording that sweet sound that it deserves
2. Replicating and manufacturing: $1500 to create the actual disk for you to posses and enjoy
3. Graphic design: $1000 to help visually represent my musical vision
4. Album promotion: $3000 which includes both radio and print media campaign to get it out there
So I’m seeking to raise a total of $7000 to complete these final steps and to make this recording a reality. In exchange for your contribution, I have created some unique and valuable rewards for you. I have gone into greater detail in the rewards section of this campaign. But a few highlights include:


Autographed CDs and digital downloads before the official release date: this will be great because you will have a chance to hear the music before the rest of the world.

Uniquely designed poster featuring album images of this project: I’m really excited about this one! The poster will feature pictures from the recording session and gigs as well as album art work. I’ll have a few specially signed by the members of the band.

Special hand painted Korean calligraphy art work: This is printed on beautiful paper brought here from Korea. These works look great when placed in a frame and hung on the wall as a decoration.

VIP tickets to upcoming performance of the Hyeseon Hong Jazz Orchestra: While we haven’t yet finalized the date, when we do you will have special guest passes for 2 to attend this amazing event! It will be a fabulous evening for sure.

An important note regarding my choice to make this the kind of campaign that will use whatever money is contributed: I will make sure that the first monies received will go directly towards getting the recording finished. If I do not receive all of the funds, I spend less on design and promotion to ensure that I am still able to fulfill all rewards as promised.

<h3>About me</h3>
<p>I'm an Australian musician and composer who has released 11 albums in diverse styles ranging from electronica to folk rock.  My first band B(if)tek (1996-2003) was an electro-femme duo who were described as ""Australia's greatest electronic innovators"" and received Aria award nominations (Oz equivalent of Grammys).  I've changed musical direction since then as I wanted to explore new sonic territory and write meaningful, poetic lyrics.</p>
<p>In 2008, I was jobless, still recovering from breast cancer and the death of my Mum. I took off to the USA with a filmmaker girlfriend.  We called ourselves The Jilted Brides - a folk-tronica outfit - and by 2009 I had been granted a Green Card on account of being 'an extraordinary alien'. I met incredible musicians during my subsequent years State-side, and some of them are helping me make this album.</p>
<p>I’ve had this album concept - a woman's take on 60s/ early 70s Dylan -  for at least 4 years now, and madly scribbling lyrics and ideas.  When I was in Los Angeles in 2015 , I recorded 3 tracks with my musician friends there. In London this year, I recorded the title track 'Deal with Your Disenchantment' and one other with the help of wonderful musician friends here.  But I've now run out of cash to mix these tracks, record more and master and finally produce the album.</p>
<p>So this is an appeal for help from my extended network of friends and anyone else who might like to hear this wildly ambitious song collection, a mad reflection on current times. And lo, in 2017 it appears we are now living in the apocalyptic political times of the late ‘60s all over again - the times they are a-changing back...</p>
<h3>The Band So Far</h3>
<p>Songs &amp; Singin': Nicole Skeltys; Bass &amp; Harmonica: Robin Hemmings; Drums (London) Matt Rosewood; Guitar (London) Rich Thomas; Recording (London) Gareth Cobb; Guitar, mandolin, production (Los Angeles): Bobby Cuff; Fiddle (Los Angeles): Karlee Cuff; Drums (Los Angeles): Ray. Audio engineers: Bobby Cuff &amp; Gareth Cobb</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What Do I Need?</h3>
<p>My target of £3900 will cover the costs of finishing a 7-8 track album including:</p>
<p>Recording studio time</p>
<p>Payments to guest musicians</p>
<p>Mixing</p>
<p>Mastering</p>
<p>100 CD duplications for donors</p>
<p>World-wide postage</p>
<p>Charges by IndieGoGo</p>
<h3>What will you get for your generosity?</h3>
<p>£10 gets you the <strong>full digital album download</strong> plus my DIY artwork.</p>
<p>£30 gets you the digital download, plus a <strong>limited edition CD</strong> version of Disenchantment <strong>(100 only will be made)</strong></p>
<p>£150 gets you all of the above plus your name on the artwork and website page <strong>credited as a co-producer</strong></p>
<p>£300 gets your <strong>name mentioned in a ballad</strong> I will compose, record and release on the album</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The title track 'Deal With Your Disenchantment' is a protest song with echoes of Hard Rain, Desolation Row etc.  But other tracks on the album will explore Dylan's many other sub-genres of this period which include: the Beat poet howl, the Cassady/ Kerouac road story, the mystical incantation, the cryptic sermon, the white blues, the 'three chords and the truth' country tune, the ballads of wronged individuals, the love lament, all strung through with acerbic wit, and surreal phrase turning. And sieved  through a contemporary female consciousness ie my brain and my experiences.</p>
<p>I have a track record of making crazy ideas come true. In the '90s, I had a vision that I could produce a female Kraftwerk sound and B(if)tek ended up headlining festivals, profiled in Rolling Stone, on TV, radio, national press.  In the 2000s, I went to the USA knowing no-one, secured 5 artist residencies and was eventually awarded a Green Card. Before this decade is out, I intend to produce an album which you can put on after Highway 61 and smile - and feel angry -  at the continuity.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What happens if: goal not met? goal exceeded?</h3>
<p>If I don't meet the £3900 goal, I won't be able to finish the album - right now.  But I will not spend your money snorting cocaine off the chests of models, it will rest in my account until I am able to scrape up the money from other sources (eg applying for arts grants, personal savings) and all obligations will eventually be met.  That might not be till 2018 however.</p>
<p><strong>If this funding target is exceeded, I’d apply the funds to:</strong></p>
<p>Commissioning professional album artwork from an award winning Melbourne graphic designer (Luke from GrinCreative)</p>
<p>Pressing the album to vinyl (250 copies)</p>
<p>Sending the LP to digital distributors (eg iTunes, Spotify)</p>
<p>Hiring a London based music publicist, with an international brief</p>
<p>That would cost £3500</p>
<p><strong>And if that target is exceeded, I'd apply the funds to:</strong></p>
<p>Shooting a high end, professional video in Los Angeles (in July 2017) with Sundance acclaimed film producer/ videographer Monty Miranda (Dylan co-financed his first feature film)</p>
<p>That would cost £4750</p>
<p>Well, one can dream.  On an idiot wind...</p>

My own album 'I Am Frightened', of which I did all the Lyrics, Music, Recording, Mixing, and Mastering on. Links to that album are below
Download;https://blindspoetry.bandcamp.com/album/i-am-fr...
Stream;https://open.spotify.com/album/3yGnfwNKaDdItxK4...


'The Spooky Scary EP' for the band Spooky Scary, where I played drums, Recorded, assisted with Editing, and Mixing. Link belowhttps://spookyscary.bandcamp.com/releases

The Editing, Mixing, and partial Production of the 'Oh, Hey' EP by Pistol Winkshttps://ghostnoting.bandcamp.com/album/oh-hey-2

A few select recordings for friends



This campaign is to aid in the creation of the album, from creation of the videos all the way to production and distribution of the final physical product.
If I gain enough interest, I could put more effort and focus on creation of music, poetry, and art that people enjoy and contribute to in the future, of which I am currently already planning on doing.

 

What We Need & What You Get

Any money put forth will go directly to the production of the album. 
Mixing/Mastering of the Audio by professionals for a higher quality finished product
Filming/Production of the Videos to be associated with the album
Delivery of Physical Portions of the album
Indiegogo's 5% fee
Any left over funds not used in the above ways will be used for future releases, or donated to a local artists collective.


Perks range from physical copies of the album, art, and short story, to personal video thank you's or a poem written for you, to myself being your personal chauffeur for a day, 
If the goal is not reached, the album will still be created, but some of the bonuses may not be entirely possible.


The Impact

This project will allow myself to create things for others' enjoyment.
Any value or worth beyond that is entirely up to you and everyone who participates
In an effort to reduce waste, physical copies of the album will not be printed. 


Risks & Challenges

I have been having issues with my wrists as of late, and thus making playing certain instruments somewhat difficult. 
Making 10 Music videos and 10-15 different Art pieces may take a bit of time.
Beyond that, the only challenge will be making something that many people enjoy


Other Ways You Can Help

If you can't contribute money, your feedback, opinions, thoughts and concerns are welcome.
You could always share this or show this to others to gain interest from those who do have something they can contribute in a monetary fashion.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>A breeze of inspiration passed over me.</h3>
<p>Perhaps it was around the time we were celebrating the Bicentenary of the Bab and Baha’u’llah. I knew I would not have the time I needed to create works for those celebrations – so I looked to the future and saw another momentous occasion on the horizon.</p>

<p>In March of that same year is also when we will begin a one-year plan. No doubt we’re going to need music to sustain us, to encourage us and to uplift our hearts to carry out the goals of our plan. </p>
<p>In anticipation of this need, I began writing and composing. </p>
<p>When COVID happened, my writing stopped as I needed to care for my family. I wasn’t sure what would be possible, and yet I felt sure I was meant to offer this service to my community and as an offering to Abdul Baha. </p>
<p>In August, I had a moment to myself and I went through what I created. While it wasn’t enough for a full album, I did have two beautiful pieces that inspired peace and hope and I want to share those songs with you and your community.</p>
<p>I want these songs to be produce with the <i>highest of production quality </i>to celebrate this time.</p>
<p>I want these songs to have an<i> orchestral string section</i>, because there is something about the sound of a string section that <i>causes the listener’s heart to break open</i>.</p>
<p><i>I want us to bring these songs to life with the help of talented filmmakers.</i> I want the film they make to be available on YouTube so everyone can hear and watch and be hit in their heart by the writings of 'Abdu'l Baha'. </p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>I’ve been singing as long as I can remember. Church, opry’s, festivals, you name it.  That's why it was such a shock to so many people when I stepped off the stage in 2010.  But the thing was that I had three little girls that needed me and the constraints singing was putting on my marriage had to be addressed.  It took me eight years to figure out that the stage wasn’t the problem and that I had a huge hole in my life that only music could fill.  So, I decided to change my mindset and my life.  My kids were older and my marriage wasn’t broken because I was a singer.  But my life was broken without the music.  I walked away from an eighteen year marriage to chase my passion and haven’t looked back.  Since then, the outpouring of support has come from all over and I finally feel as if I am doing what I was called to do!  But my voice can only reach so far. And that’s why I’m asking for your help.  There is so much more than just writing and recording that goes into making an album successful.  That’s what has brought me to this platform, to your virtual door, to ask that you help support a dream that started a long time ago when a six year old girl sang her first solo and felt the magnitude of what she possessed. </p>
<p>I’m excited to tell you that the album is finished!  All recording, printing, photographs, album artwork, and packaging have been fully paid for through hard work and my team members who believe in me.  However, if we want to be sure my music is heard far and wide, then we need a strong radio promotion And it’s expensive!  But, I’ve waited this long to pursue my dreams, and it’s important to me to make the most of this opportunity.  After all, I only get one chance to release my debut album, and I want to do it right!  </p>
<p>I am here to ask you for your help in joining my dream team.  And I wouldn’t ask for your help if I wasn’t willing to share a piece of the dream with you!  We have special perks available at various levels of financial support, and these are exclusive offers that you can only receive through this IndieGogo fundraiser.  Some perks have a limited number available so be sure to check them out!    </p>
<p>It is hard to explain just how powerful and pivotal this moment is for me.  This album has been a lifetime in the making and the songs I’ve written flowed from a wealth of life experiences that brought me to this point. Thank you from the bottom of my heart for your support of my music… and my dream.</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Radio promotion isn't cheap and it is definitely one of those services that you get what you pay for!  Here is a breakdown of the expenses and what you will receive as a perk for your contribution:</p>
<ul>
<li>Promotion for one radio single for sixteen weeks: $4,500.00</li>
<li>Unique perks are being offered as part of this campaign that are not available at our merch table or on the website!  Every level of contribution will have something you will receive in return.  Those items range from signed copies of the CD to backyard acoustic shows!  Be sure to check out these perks as there are some that are limited quantities!</li>
<li>If for some reason the project is not fully funded, all contributions will go to cover traveling expenses for our spring launch tour.  This will cover gas for the vehicles and hotel rooms for shows that are too far to travel back from the same evening.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>One thing that I have always believed is that you are never too old to achieve your goals, but moreover, you should always chase your passion!  The impact that the music from this album has already had is incredible!  Every single time I sing ""Enough"" at a show, I look out into the audience and I see women wiping tears from their face.  I have at least one of them come up to me afterward and say thank you for the reminder!  To me, THAT is true success!  If I can touch one person with my music and change their life, then I've been successful.  But I also want my girls to know that you can't let hardships in life stop you from pursuing your dreams and it's never too late to do it!  As a woman, I think it is very important to instill in young girls that you shouldn't rely on anyone else to take care of you and you should let no-one  dictate your future. I want to be living proof that you aren't too old to overcome circumstances and become successful!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>We all know that COVID has created a challenge for us all.  It was a difficult decision to release music during this time, but I know how much music has meant to my life and healed me when nothing else could so I chose to move forward with the project.  </p>
<ul>
<li><b><u>Radio Tour: if radio stations close their studios to in-studio interview, we may have to postpone the radio tour campaign.</u></b></li>
<li><b><u>While it is ideal to be able to do in-studio interviews to support the launch, we will still be able to carry out the radio promotion campaign.</u></b></li>

<h3><strong>WHO AM I?</strong></h3>
<p>My name is Jelena Jovovic. I am a jazz vocalist, composer, lyricist and pedagogue. In all these fields of my profession I always felt –and I will always feel- the need  to connect, to share and to keep growing as a musician and as a human being.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1542228464/rbowchm9hqrvtxeaf4cs.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<h3>THE PROJECT</h3>
<p>I recently  recorded an album, called Heartbeat. I need your support  to finalize the production and spread my music worldwide.</p>
<p>I have put my heart and soul into it, composed most of the music and wrote all of the lyrics, produced it and did all the music and vocal arrangements. I am thrilled about the fact that one of the greatest musicians in jazz History,  Mr. Wayne Shorter, granted me permission to record my lyrics to his composition Witch Hunt.</p>
<h3>THE CREW</h3>
<p>The musicians that joined me on this musical adventure are some of the most outstanding jazz artists born in my native country of Serbia: Vasil Hadzimanov, Milan Nikolic, Vladimir Kostadinovic and Rastko Obradovic, along with many “OMG” guests.  They are wonderful and generous companions. All of them are performing internationally, exploring different musical paths.</p>
<p>Through our musicianship that brought  this project to life, we came to be  aware that the universal power of music, the language of emotions through sound- can reach every heart. </p>

<h3>THE MOTIVATION</h3>
<p>I wanted to talk and share stories about love, about the freedom to choose love as a liberating process, a path for healing . </p>
<p>Love despite fears, love without fear. </p>
<p>The music has been inspired by different traditions and material: ancient Balkan folk songs, traditional jazz forms, modern harmonies, different atmospheres. </p>
<p>I  also drew inspiration from the memories of my childhood, the experience of being a mother, from  living on different continents. From the treasures I found on my path, life has thought me: of  the strength to overcome adversities, to fall and rise again, to be faithful to my beliefs and to my dreams.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>THE BUDGET</h3>
<p>Releasing a non-commercial album is a challenging endeavor  for all musicians around the world. So I need your help to be able to complete the production process, launching campaign ( CD production and digital campaign, video, photo shoot, remix of two songs for mass distribution) culminating with our worldwide premiere concert at a prestigious concert hall in Belgrade. The goal is to share our music with the world and with YOU.</p>

<h3>The Short Version</h3>
<p>24 Hour Cardlock is a band that plays songs about driving trucks.  Since 2002, Cardlock has been delivering a unique pileup of old-school country, guitar rawk, humor and pathos--and having a great time doing it.</p>
<p>This campaign is in support of our second studio album, ""Semibicoastal.""  Most of the album was recorded in Omaha, NE, and a couple songs were recorded with Cardlock's Pacific Division in Vancouver, BC.</p>
<p>We've been lucky enough to play for a lot of people in the last few years, and they've been kind enough to ask if we had any music they could take home with them. We're doing this campaign so that we can finally say ""yes"" to that, so that more people can find out about Cardlock, and so that we can keep on doing what we do.</p>

<p>Funding from this campaign will go back into the band.  First, we'd like to cover costs of printing CDs and other merch.  If there's enough left over, then we'll try to recoup some of our recording costs.  Anything beyond that will go back into more recording and promoting the band.</p>
<h3>What You Get</h3>
<p>Well, first of all, we're offering some good songs, well-played and recorded, for download and on CD.  You'll be able to stream this stuff later through most services, but this is a chance to get higher-quality formats, and get them first.</p>

<p><strong>Short Summary</strong></p>
<p>My name is Babatunde Akinboboye and I'm a professional opera singer who loves hip-hop. Ever since I was tricked into joining choir in high school, I have enjoyed combining classical singing styles with popular music. I finally got up the courage to record and share some of my work just a few weeks ago, and I have been overwhelmed by how well it has been received. Who knew that other people would enjoy this as much as I do!? As a performer, this means so much and it has motivated me to create even more music for people to enjoy. If this campaign is successful, it might very well lay the foundation for an entirely new style of popular  music. It will also help me to share my talents and hard-earned skills in the most authentic way that I know how.</p>
<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<p>This campaign is all about raising the funds needed to create a quality EP. My goal of $40,000 will allow me to get the ball rolling and assist with production costs. It will be a great start toward covering cover art, studio fees, accompanists, production fees, producers, editing, mixing and mastering, marketing, physical cd’s, licensing, and launching fees. A total amount of $75,000 should fully cover the project at the most marketable level and buffer against the possible risks and challenges listed below.</p>
<p>I am so appreciative of all of your help as I work towards my goal. Please be sure to check out the perks section to see what is available to you for your contribution.</p>
<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<p>Your contributions can help Hip Hopera become a full-blown genre, enriching the worlds of both opera and hip-hop.</p>
<p><strong>Risks &amp; Challenges</strong></p>
<p>If you have ever participated in or planned an event or project, you know that there are always unforeseen, hidden, and unexpected costs that come up. These are all possible challenges for this current project along with technical difficulties, illness, travel, overall production and launching issues. Fortunately, I have a team of folks working alongside me to help bring this campaign and project through even with the associated risks and challenges.</p>
<p><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></p>
<p>Some people just can't contribute, as an artist, I completely understand this. You can also help my campaign by sharing it with your friends and on your social media. There may be other people that you know who would like to contribute. Like, share, and comment where appropriate. The more eyes on this the better!</p>

Premierno jih bomo predstavili na festivalu klavirske glasbe Pianopolis v Kranju.Enako pomembna, kot izdelek, se nam zdi izkušnja, ki so jo mladi glasbeniki pridobili pri nastajanju in promociji albuma. Karierne veščine resnega, a sodobnega glasbenika v digitalno povezanem svetu vse bolj obsegajo tudi slednje.   Kaj boste lahko slišaliAlbum se bo najverjetneje začel z Etudo v C duru, F. Chopina v izvedbi Matije Drofenika, ki ji bo v nadaljevanju dodal še Sonato v B duru op. 22, L. van Beethovna. Osrednji del bo zgrajen okrog Etude - Tableaux op. 39, št. 9, Sergeia Rahmaninova, ki jo izvaja Urban Stanič, virtuozne Chopinove skladbe Andante Spianato v izvedbi Vida Ibica in Chopinove Balade št. 3 v As duru Lare Oprešnik, ki bo dodala še Romantično fantazijo in fugo v d molu, BWV 903 J. S. Bacha. Slišali  bomo tudi Makedonske plese Alojza Srebotnjaka, ki jih je posnel Urban Stanič. Haydnova Sonata v Es duru in Griegova Klavirska sonata v e molu, op. št. 7-1 bosta zveneli v interpretaciji izjemne Nastasje Češnjevar Ušumović. Pia Landeker bo izvajala še eno slovensko skladbo, tokrat Emila Adamiča. S Sonatino op. 36, št. 6  M. Clementija pa bo zaključil najmlajši Tobija Avšič.  Lara Oprešnik»Umetnost je zame potreba po izražanju, dotikanju najsvetlejših pa tudi najtemnejših delcev naše duše, nas samih. Tudi če bi hotela, brez umetnosti več ne morem.«. Lara je tudi skladateljica. 2018 je osvojila absolutno prvo nagrado na Mednarodnem skladateljskem tekmovanju Oscar Rieding. Izobražuje se pod mentorstvom profesorja Hinka Haasa in profesorice Milane Chernyavske (Akademija za glasbo v Ljubljani; Univerza za glasbo in upodabljajočo umetnost Gradec). Matija Drofenik""Moje druženje s klavirjem se je začelo v mojih mladih letih, ko sem z mamo Andreo Seljan Drofenik prihajal v glasbeno šolo v Rogaški Slatini, kjer sem se počutil kot doma."" Matija med svojimi dosežki izpostavlja 1. nagrado in 100 točk leta 2011 v Gradežu, 2. nagrado 2011 v Parizu, 2 drugi nagradi na Mladih virtuozih  2012 in 2014 v Zagrebu, 3. nagrado v Newcastlu, 1. nagrado EPTA Osijek, 2. nagrado v Geilenkirchnu,vse v letu 2017, 2. nagrado v Milanu 2018.Deluje pod vodstvom profesorice Jelice Kuzmin. (Zasebnik) Zakaj potrebujemo vašo podporoZato, ker je nismo dobili od institucij ali minstrstev. »Ploščo lahko obrnemo« in izdamo edino z vašim sodelovanjem. S tem ko kupite CD plošček ali enega od paketov,  bomo pridobili sredstva za snemanje, uglaševanje klavirja (uglasili smo ga 6x), montažo, mešanje zvoka, mastering in izdelavo ploščka. 2.100 EUR predstavlja le del proračuna za celovito izvedbo. Sredstva poskušamo pridobiti še na druge načine, vendar se še najbolj zanesemo na vas:)Urban Stanič»Sanjam o občutku, ko se na odru čas ustavi in postane glasba vse, kar obstaja.«Urban Stanič je zmagovalec slovenskega izbora za tekmovanje Evrovizijski mladi glasbeniki 2014 in prejemnik 2. nagrade na finalnem tekmovanju v Kölnu. Kot solist je večkrat sodeloval z najvidnejšimi slovenskimi orkestri in osvajal visoke nagrade na mednarodnih in državnih tekmovanjih. Deluje pod vodstvom profesorice Dubravke Tomšič Srebotnjak. (Akademija za glasbo v Ljubljani). Nastasja Češnjevar Ušumović»Kar v življenju pride zlahka ne ostane dolgo, do tega kar ti bo sledilo skozi življenje pa ni mogoče ubirati bližnjice. Zato se trudim in garam, da si zagotovim, da bodo glasba in literatura vedno ob moji strani.« Nastasja je vsestranska umetnica, ki piše že svoj drugi roman. Na 48. TEMSIG-u je osvojia 100 točk. Zmaguje pa tudi na številnih mednarodnih tekmovanjih. Izobražuje se pod vodstvom  profesorice Valentine Češnjevar. (Glasbena šola Koper) Kako lahko še pomagateZelo veliko lahko naredite s tem, da novico o Zlatih pianistih razširite med svojimi prijatelji glasbe na družbenih omrežjih in mailing listah. Če dodate k temu še kakšno dobro besedo, še toliko bolje.   Vid Ibic»Ko glasbe ne izvajam, jo poslušam.« Vid je izjemen v vsem kar počne. Osvojil je že 20 nagrad na pomembnih tekmovanjih. Na TEMSIG-u je prvič zmagal leta 2016. Nastopa tudi kot solist z orkestri, med katerimi je njegov najljubši nastop v Italiji, kjer je izvajal 2. In 3. stavek Beethovenovega koncerta. Deluje pod vodstvom profesorice Selme Chicco Hajdin (Umetniška gimnazija Koper) in profesorice Zuzane Niederdorfer (Univerza za glasbo in upodabljajočo umetnost Gradec). Pia Landeker»Glasba je nekaj, s čimer lahko izražaš svoje misli ne glede na to kakšne volje si.« Pia  je ena najmlajših zmagovalk, vendar že ima velike načrte za svojo glasbeno prihodnost. Med drugim bi rada postala učiteljica klavirja. Izobražuje se pod mentorstvom profesorice Jerneje Grebenšek (GŠ Fran Korun Koželjski, Velenje)            Tobija Avšič»Glasba je lahko tudi sprostitev.« Tobija Avšič je najmlajši zlati pianist, ki pa se je s klavirjem  srečal že zelo zgodaj. Med njegovim dosežki je zato že sedem zlatih, pet srebrnih in eno bronasto priznanje z uglednih domačih in mednarodnih tekmovanj. Muzicira tudi v klavirskem duu in komornem godalnem triu. Njegov najljubši skladatelj je W.A. Mozart. Tobija deluje pod mentorstvom profesorice Damijane Avšič.          Kako bomo porabili denarSnemanje, editing, mix, mastering in uglaševanje (6X): 2.640,00 EURIzdelava CD in promocijske borišure: 1.600,00 EURDesign & Foto: 900,00 EUR Skupaj: 5.140,00 EUR  Za kaj bomo porabili presežek denarja – če do njega pride 2.100 EUR predstavlja le del proračuna za celovito izvedbo. Del sredstev poskušamo pridobiti še na druge načine. Zato bo presežek zelo dobrodošel. Porabili ga bomo za art work, promocijo in za organizacijo koncerta.  Kdo stoji za projektomPianoRoom in Zveza slovenskih glasbenih šol. PianoRoom www.pianoroom.si je sicer specializiran studio za snemanje klavirske glasbe. Naše širše poslanstvo pa je približevanje kakovostne glasbe širši publiki in pomoč pri uveljavitvi mladih glasbenikov. Projekt Zlati pianisti smo prvič izpeljali leta 2016. Naletel je na odličen odziv.  Ogledate si ga lahko na spodnji povezavi.",8.0,2,"1 Campaign

co-create and support the birth of a musical collection to be shared, like
Pearls of life's journey:</p>
<h2>SatSong - A rosary of heart
songs</h2>
<p>After so many requests to record them
it is finally the right time!</p>
<p>Insights and inspirations created
through the community wisdom inherent in all of us.</p>
<p>Including the musical gifts of <b>Deva
Premal</b>, <b>Manose</b> and many more incredible musicians, co-produced with <b>Avishai
Barnatan</b>.</p>
<p>My name is <b>Amir Paiss</b>, and I've been
singing and writing since childhood. I co-founded SHEVA, the Hebrew Arab world
music ensemble with which I toured and performed all over Israel, in Europe,
the U.S and in Australia, where I have resided for over a decade now. For the
last 20 years I have produced music, performed and facilitated workshops

vocal practices, natural healing and Interfaith prayers and gatherings.</p>
<p><b>Satsang</b> is the Sanskrit word for

songs are resonating with what I can only describe as Truth... At times we call
it Love, Freedom, and it's always about making connection. </p>
<p>This is my first English language
album. Some of the songs have been with me for years and are being sung in
circles and sacred ceremonies around the world, some are more recent and some
are newly born. </p>

</p><p>As many of these songs are inspired

<p>The offerings (or Perks in
Indiegogo's language) vary from a digital download of the album, to your very
own Personal custom made song, designed for you. It's amazingly
exciting to be able to share in this way, knowing there is a real exchange
amongst our extended local and global community members.</p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>I believe in the power of songs and I
know first hand that songs can change lives, as songs have shaped my own life's
experience. I believe that what comes from the heart can touch the heart. This
album is soothing and mostly gentle, spiced with smiles and tears of devotion,
surrender, and joy. Your contribution will not only help in manifesting this
creation but also act as a proof that we can collaborate as people and grow
into a different mode of operation.</p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>

<p>Hey

up?! I have wonderful news to share with you! But first, for those of you who
don’t know me, I’m Vixen Noir (aka Veronica C. Combs). I am a San
Francisco, soon-to-be Los Angeles-based singer,
songwriter, recording artist, performance artist, producer and director. I
released my debut EP, DANGEROUS earlier this year and NOW, it's time to really

this, I created BLACKESQUE: The QueEROTIC Music Tour, the first and only Music

sense of self and the chaos of our strongest feelings… For the EROTIC is not a
question only of what we do; it is a question of how acutely and fully we can
feel in the doing. Once we know the extent to which we are capable of feeling
that sense of satisfaction and completion, we can then observe which of our
various life endeavors bring us closest to that fullness. ~ Audre Lorde
Hey
SupaStars! 
What’s
up?! I have wonderful news to share with you! But first, for those of you who
don’t know me, I’m Vixen Noir (aka Veronica C. Combs). I am a San
Francisco, soon-to-be Los Angeles-based singer,
songwriter, recording artist, performance artist, producer and director. I
released my debut EP, DANGEROUS earlier this year and NOW, it's time to really
start promoting it. One of the most important and fun ways to promote a new
album is to hit the road and take the music to the people! To do
this, I created BLACKESQUE: The QueEROTIC Music Tour, the first and only Music
and Burlesque tour featuring an all-Black Queer line-up of show-stopping music
artists accentuated by some of the most talented burlesque artists this country
has to offer! This inaugural tour is the West Coast Edition, kicking off in Los Angeles, with stops in Phoenix,
Flagstaff, Albuquerque, Denver, Seattle, Tacoma, Portland, Eugene, Sacramento,
Oakland, and ending in San Francisco!WHY BLACKESQUE? 
My
biggest passions are Music, Burlesque, and uplifting and supporting Black and
Brown Queer folk to reclaim and celebrate their EROTIC POWER. I’ve been wanting
to create a tour to promote my music and all of who I am as an Artist and a
person. So I thought, why not a tour that incorporates and celebrates my
biggest passions? And why not have other amazing, talented Black Queer Artists

transgender, and questioning youth to build a safer and more just New Orleans.    http://www.youthbreakout.org/I also created the tour to
provide Black Queer Artists, who are rarely acknowledged, seen, or heard in the

The

Vixen Noir (San Francisco/Los Angeles, CA)  Alt-Pop Singer-Songwriter, Kim Tillman (Los Angeles,
CA) Hip Hop/Rap Artist, Kaoz (Minneapolis, MN)and local music and burlesque artists will also

HISTORY
Focus on Oakland, CA & Applied Cultural Work in Sites of Opposition
In 2014 a small group of African American and South Asian Creative Musicians based in Oakland, CA (USA) organized a series of cultural events that challenged, transformed and buttressed current modes of community-based resistance technologies. This ""fighting formation"" engendered new dynamics in our relationships as musicians, laborers & cultural workers, social scientists and activists. Oppositional Consciousness (OpCon), as a social science, analytical and performance platform, is an emergent intervention bridging modes of artists labor-value towards a decolonized imagination, in which differential movement & democratic formations move beyond the plane of the stage into street-level practices.

<h3>Summary </h3>
<p>My name is Korey. My friends call me Korey Kingston. I am a professional drummer, music teacher, and the owner and creator of Drum Brigade. This Indiegogo campaign is so exciting for me because I've wanted to launch this project for a LONG time. I've started a unique collaboration project with some of my favorite musicians in San Diego. But even more exciting is that I am doing this music project with my dad- Kim ""Pops"" Horn. Pops and I have both had separate music careers over the years. We've occasionally played together on each others gigs from time to time, but NOTHING like this! </p>
<p>It all started with an impromptu experiment on a gig with Pops. We thought it would be fun to try a vocal rendition of Coltrane's Naima in a Roots Reggae feel. What happened was amazing! It allowed Pops and I to play comfortably in two different styles of music, at the same time!  From then on, if we were playing Naima, it was played as a Jazz/ Reggae song. The rest is history...</p>
<p>Combining two styles of music: Pop's style of Classic Jazz and my style of Classic Jamaican rhythms is what Shuffle &amp; Bang is all about! </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need to raise the funds to launch this unique music project/ collaboration between some amazing musicians and a father and his son. We want to do this on the level we believe this project deserves. Every penny of your donations will contribute to this project. Our $10,000 goal will give us the funds to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Release a debut album as digital download, and vinyl record</li>
<li>Song licensing (for cover songs)</li>
<li>Studio time to record</li>

<p>We have some amazing perks to offer. Some of our perks include receiving a digital download before anyone else, receiving a secret bonus track you can only get through this campaign, special Shuffle &amp; Bang merchandise, and more. You can even hire us for a private event!</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Throughout my career I've played in a lot of different bands. I've toured all over the world with different bands (The Aggrolites, Hepcat, Tim Armstrong, Western Standard Time, Sharp Shock, Suedehead). I've played on a lot of albums. But never my own band. And more importantly I've never had the opportunity to record and be in an official music project with my dad. In fact, I don't know any musicians who have had that unique opportunity. Thats what makes this project so special! </p>
<p>Through out this journey we have faced a few challenges. Mostly financially. This is a DIY band, meaning we have literally done everything on our own. Musicians have donated their time and energy playing, recording, writing charts, arranging tunes. Pops and I did all the web design, video filming and editing. But all along the way, the entire band has pulled together, out of sheer belief in the project. All the musicians in this group are full-time, working musicians. We all use music as our profession to make a living. Getting the financial backing to support this project would mean we could do this at the level this project deserves and have the tools to do it right!</p>

Mellotrons all over the place! The songwriting is very strong and has an atmospheric, devoted feel.'I Talk to the Wind' of the King Crimson debut could be seen as a good point of reference here. Celeste's Principe di un Giorno has songs with this amazing impacts with the same amazing wind-instruments. A warm bath of acoustic/symphonic music.A great artistic symphonic record from the italian progressive .scene. Due to it's different approach on the symphonic prog genre this is an excellent addition to almost any- ones collection.This is a record about beauty, progressive and always gentle. CELESTE NOW46 years have passed since ""La Danza del Fato"" was written. In fact it was in September of 1972 that I met with Mariano Schiavolini to lay the foundations of what would become the CELESTE project.So much time passed and about two years ago I felt a strong desire and the impulse to find myself immersed in those atmospheres again, in those spells that had been the most important and evident aspect of the adventure of PRINCIPE DI UN GIORNOIn addition over the years I have collected the invitation of many supporters, professionals who asked me to follow the first and only album of CELESTE.And now I find myself happily talking about what is now no longer just an idea, an abstraction but also a reality.The natural evolution of the Prince's path is ready. The seal of the registration has begun.All the parts have been written, the lyrics that illustrate the new path of the solitary hero, who finds himself in a new world, have found the right words. The tests with all the musicians who will participate now have highlighted the goodness of the structures and the validity of the musical proposals.Who loved the air that you breathed, and you breathe again listening to ""Prince of a Day"" can not fail to appreciate this new chapter where are repeated and consolidated the melodies, the harmonies, the sound of the same instruments, my beloved Mellotron 400, acoustic guitars, flutes and saxophones, the delicate touches of the small percussion reinvigorated by the presence of the acoustic drums.Everything has been thought in respect of the true Spirit of CELESTE. A recovery dictated by the desire to recreate BEAUTY and to make it even more present and current.There will be guest stars joining CELESTE:Elisa Montaldo from Il TEMPIO DELLE CLESSIDREAlfio COSTA from PROWLERS & TILION",1.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>The who, what and why of GG Amos~</h3>
<p> I've been honing my skills and carving my sound over a few decades. I released a few recordings but it's been a while. As a singer since the age of 4 or 5, and a guitar player since 10 years old, I've gone through several evolutions as a musician. <br/><br/> In the mid 80's I started really getting serious about learning blues music, and related styles such as rhythm &amp; blues and jazz. Funk and funky beats always grabbed me! <br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1537137326/euvn7jh6tbikrmnwnufy.jpg"" src=""""/><br/> During the 80's, 90's and 00's I had the privilege and pleasure of learning from the best around me: Sacramento legends Nate 'Snakeboy' Shiner, the late Johnny Heartsman, the late Gene Chambers..  then I was so lucky to get to know and play with Guitar Shorty, the late John Lee Hooker and more recently one of my top blues heroes, Chris Cain. Being on the San Francisco bay area scene for the last 10 years, I've grown even more as a singer and as a guitarist. Still learning .. also teaching others!  <br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1537137285/bpq3bwfdurc1zci9p8b5.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: right;""/><br/> Fast forward to now– my style is still firmly rooted in blues tradition, but definitely a modern west coast sound, with jazz, funk and California latin elements to it.

<p> This crowdfunding campaign is very important to me because it still takes money to produce a well crafted album, one that I feel will stand the test of time.

<h3>
<br/>Challenges~</h3>
<p> Every recording project is a big undertaking. I have produced my own recordings in the past, and I always had a lot of help and guidance from those much more experienced than me. This will be no different. There will be a lot of pre-production planning and organizing. Lots of rehearsals before we go in to track. Time is money in the studio and we will be very mindful of that as we work. <br/><br/> The first challenge, obviously, is achieving our financial goal so that the rehearsals can be scheduled, the studio booked, even pre-ordering some of the perks you will get as our Executive producers!   <br/><br/> Another challenge is to stay within our budget throughout the whole process; from the first day of  rehearsal to delivering the finished product and perks to you.<br/>I have a detailed outline of  the process and have already been coordinating with my studio engineer Robert Preston on a schedule and timeline. Working closely with everyone involved and being open to their input is <i>crucial </i>to success.<br/><br/> We need to get some BIG contributions in the first week to get the momentum rolling and to inspire others to jump in.  So please spread the word– Share, share, share! Email, Social media, Phone, Text and by the water cooler at work! <br/><br/>Once our goal is met or is close, I can start scheduling everything. <br/><br/><strong>The Budget:  </strong>An overview and estimate–<br/><br/>Musician Fees – $7,500 (includes rehearsals, tracking, horn arrangements)<br/><br/>Studio Fees (tracking) – $60/hour @ 80 hours = $4,800.<br/><br/>Studio Fees (mix down) – $60/hour @ 20 hours = $1,200.<br/><br/>Studio Fees (mastering) – $100/hour @ 8 hours = $800<br/><br/>Design &amp; Layout for CD and 12"" Vinyl LP – $400<br/><br/>Duplication/Manufacturing 1,000 CDs (with 6panel insert) – $1,504. (includes shipping)<br/><br/>12"" Vinyl LP  (4 panel) - Qty. 300 - $3,390. (includes shipping)<br/><br/>UPC codes, Copyright registrations, ISRC codes for royalty tracking, - $200<br/><br/>T-shirts / Water Canteens / 11 x 17 Posters/ Misc swag – $500<br/><br/>Hiring a Publicist for 4 month campaign – $6,000<br/><br/><strong>Total:</strong>  <strong>$26,294  </strong>So if we make our goal of $28,000 and after Indiegogo takes its % and card processing fees we'll net around <strong>$26,300</strong>. <br/> <br/>I have always been a very detail oriented, methodical person. I would rather aim for quality rather than quantity. To do this project right will require the right budget and that's where you all come in.

<h3>¿Quiénes somos?</h3>
<p>Este proyecto surge del trabajo de dos de las agrupaciones especializadas en música antigua más activas en la recuperación del patrimonio musical en España: la <strong>Orquesta Barroca de Granada</strong> e <strong>Íliber Ensemble</strong>.</p>
<p>Fundada en 2002 por Pablo Heras-Casado, la <strong>Orquesta Barroca de Granada</strong> es un conjunto profesional dedicado a la interpretación de música barroca de autores originarios de Europa —y, especialmente, de compositores españoles — con criterios historicistas e instrumentos antiguos. Desde 2007, su director titular es el clavecinista Darío Moreno.</p>
<p>La OBG realiza también una intensa labor pedagógica realizando cursos de interpretación con instrumentos de época y criterios historicistas dedicados a jóvenes estudiantes que desean recibir una formación orquestal especializada en este tipo de repertorio. Desde su refundación en 2007, la orquesta ha sido dirigida por importantes directores invitados, como los maestros Barry Sargent, Peter Biely, Peter Zajicek, Alfred Cañamero o Elena Borderías. La formación ha participado, asimismo, en relevantes citas musicales, ofreciendo conciertos en salas tan importantes como el Auditorio Manuel de Falla de Granada o el Auditorio Nacional de Madrid, donde interpretaron en 2013 el oratorio <i>El Mesías</i> de Händel, obteniendo los elogios de público y crítica. Además, la orquesta ha contado con solistas tan prestigiosos como Bob Van Asperen, Bart Vandewege, Michael Form, David Hernández Anfruns, Raquel Andueza o Marta Infante.</p>
<p>En el año 2011, vio la luz su primer disco, titulado <i>Ciel e terra</i>. En el álbum, publicado por la discográfica IBS Classical, la Orquesta Barroca de Granada interpreta una selección de arias de Händel, junto al tenor David Hernández Anfruns y bajo la dirección de Darío Moreno. El disco fue ampliamente alabado por la crítica especializada tanto nacional como internacional.</p>
<p>En 2017 la OBG inicia la primera temporada de ópera barroca en la ciudad de Granada con la puesta en escena de <i>La Guerra de los Gigantes </i>de Sebastián Durón, bajo la dirección escénica de Alejandro Gómez Lopera y un elenco de primeras figuras a nivel internacional que continuará el próximo año con la puesta en escena de la Zarzuela barroca ""Acis y Galatea"" de Antonio de Literes (1673-1747) en lo que supone un ambicioso proyecto de recuperación de música escénica de compositores del barroco español con el máximo rigor histórico y bajo el asesoramiento de la Asociación ""Ars Hispana"".</p>
<p>Por su parte, <strong>Íliber Ensemble</strong> es una formación de cámara dedicada al estudio y la interpretación de música barroca con criterios historicistas e instrumentos antiguos, fundada en Granada en mayo de 2013 e integrada por jóvenes músicos de distintos puntos de la geografía española. Sus objetivos son la recuperación y difusión del patrimonio musical barroco español (y, particularmente, andaluz), a la par que la divulgación de composiciones de autores europeos poco conocidos y la interpretación de obras de los grandes maestros de los siglos XVII y XVIII.</p>
<p>En abril de 2014, realizó su concierto de presentación, con gran éxito, en el Centro de Documentación Musical de Andalucía. Desde entonces, han actuado en ciclos tan importantes como el Meet In Beijing Arts Festival, el Festival Internacional de Música y Danza de Granada o el Proyecto MusaE del Ministerio de Cultura, así como en los festivales de música antigua de Granada, Córdoba, Vélez Blanco y Lorquí. Han ofrecido conciertos por toda la geografía española y, en 2018, realizan su debut internacional con una gira por China. Esto los ha llevado a actuar en salas como el Auditorio Manuel de Falla de Granada o el Daning Theatre de Shanghái, así como en espacios tan emblemáticos como el Ateneo de Madrid, la Catedral de Granada o el Tribunal Constitucional, recibiendo los elogios de la crítica especializada. Asimismo, a lo largo de su trayectoria han efectuado colaboraciones con conjuntos como la Orquesta Barroca de Granada, el Coro Tomás Luis de Victoria o Todos los Tonos y Ayres, y su labor ha sido reconocida con galardones como el Premio HEBE 2016 en la categoría de Música.</p>

<h3>El proyecto</h3>
<p>El objetivo de esta campaña es iniciar la que será la <strong>primera grabación mundial de la integral de la música escénica de Sebastián Durón (1660-1716)</strong>, uno de los compositores más importantes e influyentes del Barroco español. Para ello, comenzaremos esta serie de 10 volúmenes con la ópera <strong><i>La guerra de los gigantes</i></strong>, una de las obras más relevantes en la historia de la música escénica española, al ser la última ópera genuinamente española. Este proyecto pretende registrar estas obras con el máximo rigor histórico y con la mayor calidad musical, contando para ello con elencos vocales especializados de primer nivel internacional, así como con el asesoramiento musicológico de la Asociación Ars Hispana.</p>
<p>Sin embargo, al no disponer de ninguna fuente de financiación pública ni privada, el proyecto depende enteramente de financiación por micromecenazgo, a través de donaciones de particulares y de la ayuda que nos presten los colaboradores que así lo deseen.</p>
</div><p>Nuestra grabación comenzará el 30 de julio de este año y se desarrollará los días <strong>30, 31 de julio </strong>y<strong> 1 de agosto</strong> en el Auditorio Manuel de Falla de Granada.</p><p>¿Nos ayudas a lanzar este proyecto único?</p><p> </p><div>
<h3>Lo que necesitamos y lo que obtienes</h3>

</div></div>","¿Quiénes somos?
Este proyecto surge del trabajo de dos de las agrupaciones especializadas en música antigua más activas en la recuperación del patrimonio musical en España: la Orquesta Barroca de Granada e Íliber Ensemble.
Fundada en 2002 por Pablo Heras-Casado, la Orquesta Barroca de Granada es un conjunto profesional dedicado a la interpretación de música barroca de autores originarios de Europa —y, especialmente, de compositores españoles — con criterios historicistas e instrumentos antiguos. Desde 2007, su director titular es el clavecinista Darío Moreno.
La OBG realiza también una intensa labor pedagógica realizando cursos de interpretación con instrumentos de época y criterios historicistas dedicados a jóvenes estudiantes que desean recibir una formación orquestal especializada en este tipo de repertorio. Desde su refundación en 2007, la orquesta ha sido dirigida por importantes directores invitados, como los maestros Barry Sargent, Peter Biely, Peter Zajicek, Alfred Cañamero o Elena Borderías. La formación ha participado, asimismo, en relevantes citas musicales, ofreciendo conciertos en salas tan importantes como el Auditorio Manuel de Falla de Granada o el Auditorio Nacional de Madrid, donde interpretaron en 2013 el oratorio El Mesías de Händel, obteniendo los elogios de público y crítica. Además, la orquesta ha contado con solistas tan prestigiosos como Bob Van Asperen, Bart Vandewege, Michael Form, David Hernández Anfruns, Raquel Andueza o Marta Infante.
En el año 2011, vio la luz su primer disco, titulado Ciel e terra. En el álbum, publicado por la discográfica IBS Classical, la Orquesta Barroca de Granada interpreta una selección de arias de Händel, junto al tenor David Hernández Anfruns y bajo la dirección de Darío Moreno. El disco fue ampliamente alabado por la crítica especializada tanto nacional como internacional.
En 2017 la OBG inicia la primera temporada de ópera barroca en la ciudad de Granada con la puesta en escena de La Guerra de los Gigantes de Sebastián Durón, bajo la dirección escénica de Alejandro Gómez Lopera y un elenco de primeras figuras a nivel internacional que continuará el próximo año con la puesta en escena de la Zarzuela barroca ""Acis y Galatea"" de Antonio de Literes (1673-1747) en lo que supone un ambicioso proyecto de recuperación de música escénica de compositores del barroco español con el máximo rigor histórico y bajo el asesoramiento de la Asociación ""Ars Hispana"".
Por su parte, Íliber Ensemble es una formación de cámara dedicada al estudio y la interpretación de música barroca con criterios historicistas e instrumentos antiguos, fundada en Granada en mayo de 2013 e integrada por jóvenes músicos de distintos puntos de la geografía española. Sus objetivos son la recuperación y difusión del patrimonio musical barroco español (y, particularmente, andaluz), a la par que la divulgación de composiciones de autores europeos poco conocidos y la interpretación de obras de los grandes maestros de los siglos XVII y XVIII.
En abril de 2014, realizó su concierto de presentación, con gran éxito, en el Centro de Documentación Musical de Andalucía. Desde entonces, han actuado en ciclos tan importantes como el Meet In Beijing Arts Festival, el Festival Internacional de Música y Danza de Granada o el Proyecto MusaE del Ministerio de Cultura, así como en los festivales de música antigua de Granada, Córdoba, Vélez Blanco y Lorquí. Han ofrecido conciertos por toda la geografía española y, en 2018, realizan su debut internacional con una gira por China. Esto los ha llevado a actuar en salas como el Auditorio Manuel de Falla de Granada o el Daning Theatre de Shanghái, así como en espacios tan emblemáticos como el Ateneo de Madrid, la Catedral de Granada o el Tribunal Constitucional, recibiendo los elogios de la crítica especializada. Asimismo, a lo largo de su trayectoria han efectuado colaboraciones con conjuntos como la Orquesta Barroca de Granada, el Coro Tomás Luis de Victoria o Todos los Tonos y Ayres, y su labor ha sido reconocida con galardones como el Premio HEBE 2016 en la categoría de Música.

El proyecto
El objetivo de esta campaña es iniciar la que será la primera grabación mundial de la integral de la música escénica de Sebastián Durón (1660-1716), uno de los compositores más importantes e influyentes del Barroco español. Para ello, comenzaremos esta serie de 10 volúmenes con la ópera La guerra de los gigantes, una de las obras más relevantes en la historia de la música escénica española, al ser la última ópera genuinamente española. Este proyecto pretende registrar estas obras con el máximo rigor histórico y con la mayor calidad musical, contando para ello con elencos vocales especializados de primer nivel internacional, así como con el asesoramiento musicológico de la Asociación Ars Hispana.
Sin embargo, al no disponer de ninguna fuente de financiación pública ni privada, el proyecto depende enteramente de financiación por micromecenazgo, a través de donaciones de particulares y de la ayuda que nos presten los colaboradores que así lo deseen.
Nuestra grabación comenzará el 30 de julio de este año y se desarrollará los días 30, 31 de julio y 1 de agosto en el Auditorio Manuel de Falla de Granada.¿Nos ayudas a lanzar este proyecto único?

<p>So I’m Joylin, the combination of joy and the thing i love the most : violin. Let me tell you my story from the begining.<br/>Everything started with my mom, who didn’t had the chance to enter the Music University, so when she gave me birth, she only had this hard and obsessive wish, that her babygirl will have “the chance that she never had”, so she put the violin in my hands and started teaching me at the age of 5. Starting from that point, I didn’t had a normal childhood. At that moment I couldn’t stand the feeling that other kids were out playing and I have no friends because I’m stuck home, conditioned by violin on everything else I wanted to do. I won every contest, played on every audition and concert, but I had no friends. This thing caused me social problems until the age of 15. Don’t worry, now I am just fine, I have a lot of friends and a lovely boyfriend. I just had a hard start..<br/>But, you see.. I would sacrifice it over and over again if someone throws me back in that period. I’m one of that lucky kids where this way of doing things worked. I thank her day and night for the way that she did everything. I am 22 now, and even if she had a hard period getting used with the idea that I don’t want to play classical music anymore, she’s now very proud of me, because she realized that she raised a musical kid, and her work is complete now.<br/>So, now, after 17 years (out of 22), I make violin shows in clubs and I’m invited to events, recording violin parts for artists and play with some of them in their live concerts. I enjoy every second of it, I gain more experience from it everyday and I build my confidence and self-trust.<br/>I dream that one day I’ll bring thousands of people together and I’ll do exactly the kind of music that I have in mind, wich I could not define, unfortunatly, because it’s a combination of all stiles, with elements from all stiles.</p>

<p>I want to start working for myself independently instead of working for others. I want to build my own recording studio, create my own album, film some professionally music videos and gather a bunch of nice people and call them “my team”, who believe in me and my vision.<br/>It’s hard to build a career by knocking on doors. There are a lot of awesome voices to be explored. I’m just a violin girl who believes in herself. I don’t have a voice, unfortunatly, but i think that my gift can be equal with one, even if there are some people saying that I’m very talented but there’s no way that I will succeed to the level I want just by playing some instrument. They are so wrong! Have you noticed that no matter what gender a song is, when a violin comes on it’s part, you feel different? The only diference is that i can’t have words out of it, but i can share emotions and cool vibes, because out of all instruments, the violin is the most sensible one, nearest to human’s voice. So why can’t I just create a career based on no words, just emotions? <br/>I don’t want to compete with human voice, I just want to do my own thing. <br/>My goal is simple. Someday, I’m gonna be as “good” as a singer, I’ll have gigs all around the world, travel and be happy doing what i love more than anything in the world. <br/>I want to deliver my feelings, my undying love and compassion, my dreamy way of creating music and of course, my story. <br/>And my vision is quite simple too. Make music and be loved for what I do by as many persons as I can handle.<br/>I want to make people happy and compose things that will be forever in people’s hearts and minds. </p>

In a few years, I know that I’ll get there with some hard work, because I want to do my own work. Nobody can recreate my vision 100%.<br/>- besides studio equipment, I need the guy behind every sound and effect. I’ll need him to work with me on the album that I want to create, translate my vision and words into sounds, and good producers are expensive and hard to be found with free time. But, beeing  a part of the music industry can be good, because you get to know them all. So, I found my good guy that can help me with my project, but not for free.<br/>- I want to make 3 out of the 10 music videos for selected songs I’ll have for the album. Again, music videos are expensive if you want them to be really good. There are a lot of things that counts, like hiring the camera guy, the montage, the places and effects, the road, make-up, hair-styling, and much more.<br/>- Banks of sounds and music production licenses.

<ul><li><strong>About Me</strong></li></ul>
<p>I began writing and performing music at an age when I didn't realize the power that it had.  Throughout my musical journey, ultimately I've learned that music at it's best was not about music, but rather expressing life's realities through song.  Raised in Cleveland Heights, Ohio - an area rich in culture and diversity, my community served as an anchor in shaping my artistic philosophy. </p>
<p>With my debut single “Can’t Forget” and the follow-up single/video “Miss My Love” charting in the Top 20 on the Billboard Chart, I've shown my commitment and dedication to my craft. Blessed to be picked as the opening act of Anthony Hamilton’s national “Back to Love Tour” (with Estelle), I learned the importance of seizing the opportunity while further developing my performance skills. </p>
<p>“Holistically, so much keeps us separated – sexual preferences, economics, neighborhoods. My goal is to help break down barriers. At a concert when everyone is vibing on the music, no one cares whether the person sitting next to them has the exact same beliefs that they do.

I began writing and performing music at an age when I didn't realize the power that it had.  Throughout my musical journey, ultimately I've learned that music at it's best was not about music, but rather expressing life's realities through song.  Raised in Cleveland Heights, Ohio - an area rich in culture and diversity, my community served as an anchor in shaping my artistic philosophy. 
With my debut single “Can’t Forget” and the follow-up single/video “Miss My Love” charting in the Top 20 on the Billboard Chart, I've shown my commitment and dedication to my craft. Blessed to be picked as the opening act of Anthony Hamilton’s national “Back to Love Tour” (with Estelle), I learned the importance of seizing the opportunity while further developing my performance skills. 
“Holistically, so much keeps us separated – sexual preferences, economics, neighborhoods. My goal is to help break down barriers. At a concert when everyone is vibing on the music, no one cares whether the person sitting next to them has the exact same beliefs that they do. As an artist, I want to do things that reveal me as unlimited in my creativity and with the purpose of unity.”
The Campaign
The #AntoineDunn1Million campaign is the key to reaching the next chapter in my music career.  My goal is to reach one million hearts, one million ears and touch one million souls with my sophomore album.  With your pledge, together we can bring this movement to people all over the world!

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>We have been self-managed for six years now, which means that we have personally overseen every creative decision to date since the formation of Vivace! We'd love for you to be a personal part of our new project and follow our story! </p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Who We Are - Our short story!</strong> ~ELEGANT - VIVID - VIVACIOUS ~ Vivace is a modern and thrilling combination of four unique and exceptional pop and classical singers. Based primarily out of Vancouver, Vivace started merging their talents in 2010 performing at the Vancouver Winter Olympic Games. Since then, they have gone on to tour extensively through the United States and Canada. Members have shared the stage and billed events with David Foster, Ben Harper, Jackson Browne, Katy Perry, Loverboy, Colin James, Mark Masri, the former Canadian Tenors, with key appearances at TedxVancouver 2010, in addition to the 2010 Vancouver Olympics.</li>
<li>
<strong>Our Campaign!</strong> We are campaigning to be able to record and release our new title EP, 'Diamonds,' in September 2018. We are thrilled to be back in the studio with up-and-coming producer Xander Miller (Victoria Duffield, Expo Line Recordings), with arrangements by Roy Tan (The Canadian Tenors, Destino), and strings performed by 'Blackdog String Quartet' (Michael Buble, Kanye West). 'Diamonds' will be a combination of powerful and emotionally driven vocals, with a diverse repertoire ranging from pop to arias. As Vivace, we love to put a fresh new take on the classical and modern music of today, and we have some very unexpected songs that we are excited to interpret and cover on this album! It is important to us to bridge the gap between pop and classical, and as our last album release was six years ago, we figured it's time to spin our wheels again! The album release includes not just recording vocals, but strings and brass. We are including a photoshoot and cover video shoot to artistically support the recording.</li>

</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<ul>
<li>As Vivace, we love to bridge the gap between classical and modern genres, and to create unexpected and unique interpretations in the popera genre. As a supporter, your contribution will support our music, and ignite an interest of classical music to younger generations. We went through HUNDREDS of songs, and the choices we have picked are traditional Italian to songs you grew up on to modern pop.</li>
<li>In 2012, we released our very first EP, which included classical standards such as 'Nessun dorma' with a pop twist, and self-written material such as 'The World to Me.' We sold this album at over 100 shows across Canada and the US, and received a major compliment on 'Prayer in the Night' from the writers who mentioned that our version was their favourite. Our goal is to make a similar project happen all over again.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>You may have noticed we have gone through many changes in the past. Despite the curveballs music, life and the industry have thrown at us, we keep trucking on. We've held the group together, at times truly by a thread, for six years. Our zest for music, insatiable desire to understand what works and what doesn't, love for our followers and audience, and stubbornness to not give up has gotten us through trials in the past and will continue for the future. Truth be told, a reality is that we never did fully pay off our first album in album sales. The intent of this album is not to profit financially - it is to please our fans and followers.</p>

I've had the opportunity to travel to different cities, performed for the troops, the homeless, orphans, and helped raised funds for people in need. I've met some interesting people and also shared the stage with some great comedians like Trevor Noah, Jim Gaffigan, Alonzo Bodden, Chris Rock, and Amy Schumer . I've also appeared in some  television shows such as ""Bad Sex"" on Logo/MTV, ""Stand Up &amp; Deliver"" on Hulu, ""Laughs"" on FOX, and currently a show ""Not for Nothin"" on Amazon Prime.</p><p>I’m planning to release my comedy rap album in the next few months. This is one of my dreams since I was 12 years old. I’ve been rapping and producing music before I started comedy and acting and I thought it would be fun to finally get this out of my system. The album concept is called “Character Flaws” which features 7 different character/personas of mine. So it will have a compilation album feel, sort of like a one man Wu-Tang. For those that enjoy classic hip hop from the 90s and early 2000s, that was the vibe I was trying to capture. I was inspired by to the comedic rap styles of Redman, Ol Dirty, Ludacris, Eminem, Big L, and Biggie. Even though I am a comedian, my first love was hip hop. I finally found a way to bring both worlds together with this album. So if your a classic hip hop, music, and comedy fan this album might be for you. I’m taking the independent route with the release of this album, meaning that I won’t have the marketing and production budget of a major label. I’ve always been an advocate of full creative control through the independent and grassroots movement of the arts. I’m asking my supporters, fans, friends, and family to contribute to the marketing of this project. I plan to raise funds to produce, promote, and market this project.</p><p> </p><p>I need to finish the album by renting a recording studio, hire a sound engineer for mixing and mastering, and hiring producers. I also plan to promote through online social media ads, hiring a publicist, filming music videos, flyers/posters, and special events. Contributors will have the first priority in receiving a digital download of the album or physical copy along with other promotional materials.</p><p>In addition, I plan to donate 20% of the money raised to the Angels 2 Angels. Angels 2 Angels is a non-profit organization that works with orphanages and abandoned children. They feed, clothe, nourish, mentor and educate vulnerable children so that they may experience a sense of belonging, and lead a life of independence and purpose. They work with orphanages on sustainability programs designed to empower and equip them, to ensure that the highest quality of protected, loving care is provided to the kids. Here is their website: <a href=""https://angels2angels.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://angels2angels.org</a></p><p>I've personally worked with Angels 2 Angels to volunteer at an orphanage ""Siempre Para Los Ninos"" in Mexico to help bring donations to orphans and spend time with them.</p><p> </p><p>What I Need &amp; What You Get</p><p>I will need an estimate of $8,000-$10,000 for this campaign.</p><p>My costs:</p><p>A recording studio, sound engineer to mix and master the the album: $1500</p><p>Music Production: $1500</p><p>Marketing (Album launch party, Flyers, Publication Ad, online advertising): $4000</p><p>Web Designer to design my website to promote my art and music: $800</p><p>CD Duplication and Packaging for 1000 DVDs: $1200 </p><p>All I am asking is for a minimum donation of $10 and you will receive an advanced digital copy of the album. $20 will get you advanced signed copy. Extra donations are welcome and have more perks..</p><p>Even if I raise half of the $8,000 goal, I can still place the order for 1000 CDs with minimal marketing, but it would be nice to be able to raise awareness of my comedy rap album through a new website, online ads, launch party, and some flyers.</p><p>Risks &amp; Challenges</p><p>I believe we can achieve this goal with the help of my supporters and loyal fans.  I've contacted over 200  people personally and most agreed to donate a minimum of $20 for a advanced copy of the album.

Here is their website: https://angels2angels.orgI've personally worked with Angels 2 Angels to volunteer at an orphanage ""Siempre Para Los Ninos"" in Mexico to help bring donations to orphans and spend time with them. What I Need & What You GetI will need an estimate of $8,000-$10,000 for this campaign.My costs:A recording studio, sound engineer to mix and master the the album: $1500Music Production: $1500Marketing (Album launch party, Flyers, Publication Ad, online advertising): $4000Web Designer to design my website to promote my art and music: $800CD Duplication and Packaging for 1000 DVDs: $1200 All I am asking is for a minimum donation of $10 and you will receive an advanced digital copy of the album. $20 will get you advanced signed copy. Extra donations are welcome and have more perks..Even if I raise half of the $8,000 goal, I can still place the order for 1000 CDs with minimal marketing, but it would be nice to be able to raise awareness of my comedy rap album through a new website, online ads, launch party, and some flyers.Risks & ChallengesI believe we can achieve this goal with the help of my supporters and loyal fans.  I've contacted over 200  people personally and most agreed to donate a minimum of $20 for a advanced copy of the album. The album will be released no matter what the results of the campaign. I strongly believe in this project and look forward to the release.Other Ways You Can HelpI understand that some people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean you can't help:You can also help by spreading the word and make some noise about the campaign. Please use the Indiegogo share tools!Thank you so much for your continued support and look forward to sharing my creative endeavors with everyone.

<h3>THE ALBUM</h3>
<p>• Titled: When Odysseus Wept...a nod to the classic Greek epic and coincidentally(?) an apt metaphor for the making of this album: a grand labor-of-love, a struggle, a joy, an expansion of our consciousness! </p>
<p>• Composed as an album in the traditional sense.  A ten song musical journey. </p>
<p>• Recorded on modest equipment, in domestic spaces, without the financial support /or dictates of any corporate overlords.</p>
<h3>THE LOWDOWN</h3>
<p>• 300 vinyl records, in colorful gate-fold jackets, designed by the band (see mock-up at the top of this page). </p>
<p>• Total cost: about $3500.  Includes the cost of mastering (professional preparation of the songs), manufacturing, and color printing. </p>
<p>• We currently do not have the support of a record label and are thus financing this ourselves, so contributions made now, in the form of pre-orders, will wonderfully assist us by providing upfront cash to put towards down-payments , etc.</p>
<p>• Completion date: November 2018</p>
<h3><strong>THE PERKS</strong></h3>

<p>• The top perk includes an ULTRA-RARE copy of the first Stark Folk record (2008).  This was originally a pressing of 100, 25 of which were lost by American Airlines, thus only 75 exist.  Of those, we only have a few left in our possession, so it really is a rare piece of our history. </p>

<p><strong>Purpose: Raise money to create a professional world class music studio</strong></p>
<p><strong>I have a strong vision and aspiration of being able to act as a producer to help bands create something new, fresh and interesting with music.  </strong></p>
<p><strong>I have been managing, performing and playing music since the early 2000s. </strong> In the last 10 years I have <strong>mixed and or mastered material</strong> for Troldmand, Damo Suzuki, Carlton Melton, Sonic Shamen, Thor Boding, Syreregn, Doctors of Space, Astral Visions, Dr Space,  Aural Hallucinations and Øresund Space Collective. </p>
<p>I have appeared on over 80 releases (LPs, CDs, 7”, CD-R, DVDs, etc..- see link below) including the bands Øresund Space Collective, Black Moon Circle, Syreregn, White Hills, Gas Giant, West Space and Love, The Sonic Shamen, Carlton Melton, Maat Lander, 3rd Ear Experience, Albino Rhino, Automaton, Doctors of Space, Dr Space’s Alien Planet Trip, Aural Hallucinations and others. </p>
<p><strong>I have been part of the music scene for 30 years as a music fan, attending, writing about and reviewing music</strong> (see links below). Since 2000, I have also performed with many bands and been part of two record companies (Burnt Hippie Recordings, <a href=""http://spacerockproductions.de"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Space Rock Productions</a>).</p>
<p><strong>I created my first home studio in 2009 as a simple place with focus on great acoustics</strong>.  I have gained a lot of experience and expertize over these years and found the acoustic environment is extremely important to creating impressive mixes. I have invested a lot of time studying acoustics, trying to find just the right people to design, and to build a world class studio (see details below).</p>
<p>In 2015, I retired from my job as a senior Diabetes Research scientist to focus on my passion in music. <u>Having my own professional studio is my complete focus in life now</u>. I really want to create my own music but also help other realise their own music and be able to record it for them in high quality. A studio like this simply does not exist in Central Portugal.</p>
<p>Running my own music studio is not a mere pipedream, but rather something that I will commit the next many years on my life on. As such, work on the studio has already started, and I've currently invested €5600 of my own money, and plan on investing another €40,000 of my own money. In addition, a lot of the required equipment for the studio is also already in-house (see below).</p>
<p><strong>This is where the money has gone so far:</strong></p>
<p>Studio Design- (2500€)</p>
<p>Designed by Stuart Allsop in Chile. Professional acoustic engineer.</p>
<p><a href=""http://spartanew.digistar.cl/Forum/index.php"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://spartanew.digistar.cl/Forum/index.php</a></p>
<p>Local Council Fees- 500€</p>
<p>Structural Engineer- 600€</p>
<p>Local Architect- 2000€</p>
<p><strong>Where your money will go:</strong></p>
<p><strong>1. Constructing the main studio building- 80m2 (26,000€)</strong></p>
<p>I will use local builders that have worked with me before.</p>
<p>Construction is due to start in October 2020. The building will be completed by the end of November. </p>
<p><strong>2. Studio Build- ~40-50,000€</strong></p>
<p>The design for the inside is as follows: Control room (24m2), live room with equipment storage room (32m2), and entrance room that can also be used as a vocal booth (15m2). The inside will be built by Joules Newell, a world class studio builder based in Portugal. His father was a famous studio builder and also mixed GONG!! He will also work with other locals to insure we have a great studio. </p>
<p><a href=""http://www.newellacousticengineering.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.newellacousticengineering.com/</a></p>
<p><strong>3. Other equipment (5-15,000€)</strong></p>
<p><strong><i>The equipment we have is as follows:</i></strong></p>
<p>24 channels UAD Apollo interface running Logic. Yamaha HS80M Studio monitors, 4 channels of TL audio tube pre-amps, 2 channel TL audio equalizer, Audient ASP880 8 channel preamp, 19” Roland Space Echo unit, Roland Re101 and RE201 space echos, many microphones (4 handmade Swedish condenser Line CM3 mics, 2 SM57, SM58, Studio Projects B1 Vocal Microphone, Omnitronic DSM-500 drum kit microphone set, AKG D112 Mark II, Audix D6 and Prosonus PRM1).</p>
<p>As for studio instruments, we have a lot of keyboards and synthesizers (Hammond XB-2, Nord lead 2, Octave CAT, ARP Odyssey, Roland D-50, Novation Ultranova, Yamaha CS-10, Custom Modular Synth), as that is what I play and collect. We also have an Yamaha acoustic guitar, mandolin, misc percussion instruments, Squire precision bass, Ludwig drum kit (on the way), Custom 2 cabinet Bass stack (Made by Bass Labs in Copenhagen), Marshall Cabinet (circa 1982-83). Bongos, various small percussion instruments. </p>
<p><strong><i>What we still need:</i></strong></p>
<p>I am still in need of a guitar head, bass head, 2nd guitar amplifier, cables, microphone stands, Leslie speaker for the Hammond XB-2,  16 channels of Pre-amps, more high quality microphones, headphones, etc.... As well as a new computer.  </p>
<p><strong>4. Kickstarter fees (about 2000€)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Goal-</strong> About 70,000€ is the total budget but the goal is to raise about 20-30,000€.  IF we raise even more money, then I will be able to get some even better microphones, pre-amps, guitar amps. perhaps set up to do 5.1 mixing.</p>
<p><strong>Risks and challenges</strong></p>
<p>The Risk is extremely low as we have already started to build the studio, have a lot of the necessary equipment and are working with some of the best in the world (Joules Newell and Stuart Allsop).</p>
<p><strong>Timeline- Expect the studio to be finished in mid 2021</strong></p>
<p>The studio construction has begun.  The sooner we have the funding, the sooner we can finish creating this amazing place to make music! Thank YOU!</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<ul>
<li>Slamuel Cunningham a  Singer Songwriter. Writes and performs his version Americana and Alternative music across Texas and else where.</li>
<li>This campaign kills 2 birds with one stone! These songs have been stacking up in my basement and attic for too long. People should hear them and listen at their own risk... lol they are ""Demos"" rough recordings but with these junk drawer gems we want to make smooth, well tracked professionally  mixed well played studio recordings of  new songs! Out with the old in with the new. But if you are like me and appreciate odd things maybe you will like or even love ""Whiskey Gut Shot Demos.""</li>
<li>By saying yes! And taking advantages of these perks you will help myself and my band greatly. We will be able to record some quality new music in an excellent way!</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>If we raise $1000 we should be able to record one high quality single. Where does the money go? Good question. Well I want to record at Sound Arts Recording Studio is Houston Texas. I have found Brian Baker to be the best engineer getting the best out of me in his state of the art recording studio. If we record original tracks $70 an hour times 8 hours that's $560 plus $125 per session player we may use 2-3 because these guys are the best 3 session players $375, so $560 + $375 = $935 not to mention mixing and mastering... but it gets me started and we can use more of our own money if need be... but the struggle is real, laugh out loud, </li>
<li>$5 Perks: For pledges of $5.00 or more you get all the digital downloads of ""Whiskey Gut Shot Demos.""</li>
<li>$15 Perks: For Pledges of $15.00 or more you get the digital downloads of ""WGSD"" and a limited edition poster print of the album art signed and numbered by the artist 1-100 0f 100.</li>
<li>$25 Perks: For Pledges of $25.00 or more you get the digital downloads of "" WGSD (Whiskey Gut Shot Demos)"" and a T-shirt they come in black or white they have hot pink in them.</li>
<li>$35 Perks: For Pledges of $35.00 or more you get: The Downloads! The Limited edition signed art! and The Shirt!</li>
<li>$55 Perks: For Pledges of $55.00 or more you get: The Downloads! The Limited edition signed art! And 2 Shirts!</li>
<li>$500 Perk: For Pledges of $500 or more you get everything in the $55 Perk plus a house Concert at your house with Slamuel Cunningham and Drummer Jesse Babyak on a Saturday TBD.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>Your partnership with artist like me keeps independent and alternative art alive! What would the world be like if only big corporations could make music; or if underground art wasn't there to give us something different?</li>
<li>I've never done a crowd campaign before but I know how to make music in the studio. Check out my previous band ""Runes of Eden- Chiffondle Me"" EP on itunes <a href=""https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/chiffondle-me-ep/1085415141"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/chiffondle-me...</a>

<li>This is and has been my dream since I was a little boy actually and being able to write and record these songs is a complete dream come true. Thank you all I love you.</li>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Normally there are a lot of Risk to the contributors or pledgers of a crowd funding campaign but I have taken all the risk upon myself by already producing all the content and merchandise in advance for the Perks so everything will be ready to deliver to you once this campaign is over.

<h3>Short SummaryDoris Fields aka Lady D...is known as W.Va’s First Lady of Soul.<br/><br/>Lady D has been singing since the age of three years old. She is an actress, songwriter, director, playwright, promoter and poet. She has toured her one-woman show, “The Lady and the Empress” since 2003. It is a musical stage play based on the life and music of blues legend, Bessie Smith. She has performed her award winning song, ""Go Higher"" at one of President Barack Obama's 2009 inaugural balls. She has performed with blues stars such as Johnny Rawls and Bruce Katz.<br/><br/>Lady D returns with her sixth studio recording; an all original offering rooted firmly in the Blues and her Appalachian upbringing. With a little bit of help from friends, fans and anyone who loves the blues, she hopes to showcase not only her vocal and songwriting capabilities but also her talent as a poet.<br/><br/>Along with her album titled ""Disturbing My Peace"" Lady D is finally sharing the fruits of another of her artistic outlets. “Appalachian BluesSpeak” is a book that will feature poetry, spoken word, essays and song lyrics that paint a picture of what it has been like being a black female creative, growing up and living in Appalachia.<br/><br/>“Appalachian BluesSpeak” is scheduled to be released ahead of the album and will be offered as one of the perks of donating to the cd production. It is also a live performance piece that may be booked as a perk for upper level donations.</h3>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Honestly! The cost of studio recording is not cheap, especially when you are using quality musicians and engineering. I am trying to raise $7500 for this project. Here is what it will help cover:</p>
<ul>
<li>Studio time/engineering</li>
<li>Musician fees</li>
<li>Copyright</li>
<li>Promotional video</li>
<li>CD artwork &amp; printing</li>
<li>CD duplication</li>
</ul>
<p>In return for your appreciated support, you'll receive some really cool perks! So check out that section to see what could be coming your way.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This will be my first attempt at such a heavily blues filled recording. As my performances have lead me into that genre more and more and I have been embraced by the Blues community. I feel it's time to take the leap and do something for those fans of my blues performances that really reflects who I am and my artistic expression of the life I have lived. Being from West Virginia, I think of it as Appalachian Blues, creating my own lane!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Life is risk! I'm a singer/songwriter and actress. Whenever I present my work, there's a risk that someone will not like it. There's also a risk that someone will. I'm betting on those people!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Some people just can't contribute. I understand, but that doesn't mean you can't help:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ask folks to get the word out and make some noise about my campaign.</li>
<li> Use the Indiegogo share tools!</li>

With a little bit of help from friends, fans and anyone who loves the blues, she hopes to showcase not only her vocal and songwriting capabilities but also her talent as a poet.Along with her album titled ""Disturbing My Peace"" Lady D is finally sharing the fruits of another of her artistic outlets. “Appalachian BluesSpeak” is a book that will feature poetry, spoken word, essays and song lyrics that paint a picture of what it has been like being a black female creative, growing up and living in Appalachia.“Appalachian BluesSpeak” is scheduled to be released ahead of the album and will be offered as one of the perks of donating to the cd production. It is also a live performance piece that may be booked as a perk for upper level donations.
 

What We Need & What You Get
Honestly! The cost of studio recording is not cheap, especially when you are using quality musicians and engineering. I am trying to raise $7500 for this project. Here is what it will help cover:

Studio time/engineering
Musician fees
Copyright
Promotional video
CD artwork & printing
CD duplication

In return for your appreciated support, you'll receive some really cool perks! So check out that section to see what could be coming your way.

The Impact
This will be my first attempt at such a heavily blues filled recording. As my performances have lead me into that genre more and more and I have been embraced by the Blues community. I feel it's time to take the leap and do something for those fans of my blues performances that really reflects who I am and my artistic expression of the life I have lived. Being from West Virginia, I think of it as Appalachian Blues, creating my own lane!

Risks & Challenges
Life is risk! I'm a singer/songwriter and actress. Whenever I present my work, there's a risk that someone will not like it. There's also a risk that someone will. I'm betting on those people!

Other Ways You Can Help
Some people just can't contribute. I understand, but that doesn't mean you can't help:

<p>Around 12 months ago, I started working out a big ambition: to record a professional album. After hunderds of working hours (brainstorming, composing, rehearsing, recording and designing the product) the final result is finally in my hands. However, the best part is yet to come: bringing this album in the hands of music lovers like you!</p>
<p>'Inner Home' will be released on <u>limited edition transparent vinyl</u> and on a <u>beautifully designed cd</u>. To cover the production costs, I am asking for your support. To thank you for a donation, you will be among the first to receive the album or a related reward. More about that below.</p>

<h3>About The Creator &amp; The Production</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1583399358/nptwidhizls9q9zosavn.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>My name is Simon Hölscher and I'm from the Netherlands. At the age of 7, I had my first drum lesson on a simple rubber practice pad. Little did I know, drumming would become my biggest passion and I would be playing hundreds of concerts, both in the Netherlands and abroad.</p>
<p>After four years of intensive music study at the Conservatory of Utrecht, I was still hungry for more. I moved to Denmark in 2018 for a two-year study called 'Master of Music' at the Royal Academy of Music. This is where my album came about. I made many new friends, who often amazed me with their musical abilities. Watch the video on top of this page to see them in action. <a href=""https://open.spotify.com/artist/4rCd60DIaLfSjdWrvw7oxn?si=uKEO955QTT-JKZOFiGu2Fw"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Two of our singles have been released earlier this year.</a></p>
<p>I used to be drummer of a British/Dutch indie band called Alcuna Wilds. We recorded the EP <i><a href=""https://alcunawilds.bandcamp.com/album/nothing-is-nothing"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Nothing Is Nothing</a></i> in 2018, which has taught me some of the ins and outs of album production. That knowledge has enabled us to work in the most creative, cost-efficient and professional way. </p>
<p>The album has been recorded in the House of Music in Aalborg, DK. Most of the recording has been done by the skilled engineer Martin Korsgaard. Jon Alexander was in charge of mixing and mastering. Before moving to Copenhagen, Jon has been in the recording team at Abbey Road Studios in London (best known from The Beatles). The visual appearance of the album has been created by photographer Sam Tomajko.</p>

<p>I hear you thinking: ""So all the work has been done already?"" Yes, the album is finished and the CD copies are made. Vinyl records will be ready for shipping at the end of March.</p>
<p><strong><i>Speaking of vinyl...</i></strong></p>
<p>Getting your record pressed on vinyl is quite expensive. Your donation will help me cover the manufacturing costs. And that's where you get to reap the benefits: 150 of those special transparent vinyl records are available to donors. If you donate <u>before 25th of March</u>, you will even receive it before the official release date.  Do you prefer CD or digital? Got you covered!</p>
<p>There will be two moments of shipping for all the perks:</p>

<h3>The Impact You Make</h3>
<p>Creative people usually don't like the business side of things, but I go about my future as if I'm running a startup. This album release is an investment in my future. One of the highest achievements for artists is being able to make a sustainable living from their art. Our connection between artist and audience is indispensible here. I will soon leave the safe music academy life behind me. Your support illuminates the path towards a succesful career with many concerts, music releases and other milestones to come! We can enjoy that together for a lifetime.</p>

<p>If 75% of the goal is reached, I will upload a full length studio clip of one album track.</p>
<p>If 100% of the goal is reached, I will give away one extremely rare test pressing of <i>Inner Home</i> to one of the donors. This one is pressed on black vinyl and will be signed with a personal message.</p>

<h3><font>Hi, i'm Johan.  Previously i runned the Toothpick and Kraak labels.  Nowadays i'm doing basically the same with Knotwilg Records. In the past i financed most stuff on a personal level but seeing the ""niche"" of this experimental field i need some financial backbone to keep the label running in support of the artists which are seeking a wider audience.</font></h3>
<p> </p>
<p><font>Being passionate about something is no crime but i think small scaled labels should be honest towards themselves/artists.  Facts remain what they are.  Releasing stuff in small scaled editions need to sell out to break even.  Sometimes that works, but there's hardly any profit left to invest in a new project.  But while a wider audience does embrace the vinyl hype mainly buying unnecessary reiusses, young or unknown artists are often obliged to turn themselves into either doing everything themselves or towards small labels. </font></p>
<p><font>Knotwilg provides a platform for unheard melodies/sounds.  But without financial backing i can not provide, nor plan, a decent Knotwilg release schedule without garanty towards a small, but dedicated fanbase.  Been there, done that but my job wages are way too low to provide that garanty.</font></p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><font>I'm looking into a flex funding so i can go ahead with contacting bands and starting to release the so far 5 lps and a couple of 7""'s planned.   Depending on how this funding goes i will give out new names by the end of 2017.  </font></p>
<p> </p>
<p><font>The <strong>easiest</strong> way to support is simply clicking the ""back it"" button.  But there are <strong>goodies</strong> as well. Each release will have a small edition of a maximum run of 300 copies (most even less, in case of a lathe cut maximum 150 copies).  Every release also has a initial edition which is different to the ""standard"" release.  The highest perks will get a testpressing on top of it.</font></p>

</div></div>","Hi, i'm Johan.  Previously i runned the Toothpick and Kraak labels.  Nowadays i'm doing basically the same with Knotwilg Records. In the past i financed most stuff on a personal level but seeing the ""niche"" of this experimental field i need some financial backbone to keep the label running in support of the artists which are seeking a wider audience.
 
Being passionate about something is no crime but i think small scaled labels should be honest towards themselves/artists.  Facts remain what they are.  Releasing stuff in small scaled editions need to sell out to break even.  Sometimes that works, but there's hardly any profit left to invest in a new project.  But while a wider audience does embrace the vinyl hype mainly buying unnecessary reiusses, young or unknown artists are often obliged to turn themselves into either doing everything themselves or towards small labels. 
Knotwilg provides a platform for unheard melodies/sounds.  But without financial backing i can not provide, nor plan, a decent Knotwilg release schedule without garanty towards a small, but dedicated fanbase.  Been there, done that but my job wages are way too low to provide that garanty.
 
 
I'm looking into a flex funding so i can go ahead with contacting bands and starting to release the so far 5 lps and a couple of 7""'s planned.   Depending on how this funding goes i will give out new names by the end of 2017.  
 
The easiest way to support is simply clicking the ""back it"" button.  But there are goodies as well. Each release will have a small edition of a maximum run of 300 copies (most even less, in case of a lathe cut maximum 150 copies).  Every release also has a initial edition which is different to the ""standard"" release.  The highest perks will get a testpressing on top of it.
 
I can't give out names  (besides Saule (B) & Weiland (B) but will do so every time one goal is achieved.
Previous artists released  are Noel Meek (NZ), Sandoz Lab Technicians (NZ), Gangalai & Gourabai (B), Weird Dust (B) and Kanker Kommando (B)
Future schedule
KW07: Stefan Christensen (US) : City Code LP
KW08: TBA: Tba LP
KW09: Weiland (B): Perouche 7""
KW10: TBA: Tba 7"" or LP
KW11: Saule (B): tba LP

The works will be premiered by LSE at the Roycroft Campus in East Aurora, NY in June 2021, Hubbard’s 165th birthday month.</p>
<p>The project, <i>Little Journeys to the Homes of the Great, </i>aims to breathe fresh life into all of Hubbard’s contributions to American culture.</p>
<p>LSE and GBP have hand-chosen five talented composers, five incredible writers, and seven musicians to collaborate on this project (<strong><a href=""https://liminalspaceensemble.com/ljhg/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">read about them here!</a></strong>). Each composer is paired with a writer and will choose a notable time or event from the life of Elbert Hubbard to inspire both a literary and musical work. The pairs will collaborate on the form and instrumentation of their pieces and the final result will be premiered in June 2021, Hubbard’s 165th birthday month in East Aurora, New York, the home of the Roycroft campus.</p>

<p style=""text-align: center;"">A snowy day at our first meeting on the Roycroft campus.</p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This project is a celebration of community. Elbert Hubbard’s Roycroft artisan community brought together like-minded individuals to create art, discuss new ideas, and bring high-quality goods and products to WNY. We could think of no better way to honor his legacy than to once again, bring together a group of artists to create something new for the community to enjoy.</p>
<p><i>Little Journeys to the Homes of the Great</i> aims to breathe fresh life into all of Hubbard’s contributions to American culture. While known to many locals in the Western New York area as the founder of the Roycroft campus, few are aware of the intricacies and complexities of the man himself, and fewer still of the global reach of his influence. Western New Yorkers take pride in their cultural exports, and we think this project will go a long way towards building a stronger understanding of the man at the center of an entire cultural movement.</p>
<p>Now more than ever, society is turning to music and art to lift our spirits and bring us together. This will be a project that was born out of turmoil and its timely completion will be a constant reminder to us all that beauty and new life can always be found even in the darkest of circumstances.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Why we need your help</h3>
<p>During the time of COVID-19, the performing arts have been hit particularly hard. Both LSE and GBP have had to cancel the remainder of their performing seasons, resulting in a significant loss of revenue. LSE and GBP are small sole-proprietorships and therefore ineligible to receive emergency funding from the state and other arts organizations. Many of the composers and writers involved in this project have lost work and many of them are depending on the income from this project to sustain their livelihoods.</p>
<p><strong>Your participation in this campaign will go directly to our composers and writers to pay their commission fees</strong>.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hi! I'm Shawn, and I'm extremely excited to announce the release of my new album, <i>Puzzles</i>. These ten songs are the culmination of the last five years of my life, following me as I went through college, started a relationship, and moved across the country. <i>Puzzles</i> takes musical queues from the last album, but growth is apparent in every aspect. There's more instruments, better songwriting, better recording, and an amazing and growing group of people involved. </p>
<p>By supporting this campaign, you're preordering the album and merch, and helping to fund some of the up-front costs associated with mastering and manufacturing. We'd like to make this album the best that it can be, and we'll need your help to do that. </p>
<h3>Who are you?</h3>
<p>I'm Shawn, a singer and songwriter from Syracuse, NY and now living in San Francisco. I didn't start singing until the end of high school, but quickly fell in love with it. I had been playing guitar and piano and writing things here and there, but singing brought the opportunity for me to write lyrics to tell a story in my songwriting. I started writing songs continuously, quickly coming out with my first album, <i>The Dream, </i>at the beginning of college. Now that I'm done with school and moving on to the next chapter of my life, I'm ready to tell my story through my new music.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What's in it for me?</h3>
<p>An album of course! Releasing on digital, CD, and vinyl. You can also get stickers, t-shirts, and every physical release will come with a polaroid taken during the recording process (while supplies last). Some packages even include mystery merch items handmade by John and I! </p>
</div><div>
<h3>If you can't contribute financially: </h3>
<p>You can support in other ways! Sharing the campaign with your friends and family will make a big difference. This doesn't just mean sharing it on Facebook, word-of-mouth is the most impactful!</p>

<h3>Dear Mother...</h3>
<p>Two years ago, a parcel was discovered in an old suitcase during a house clearance in Hartlepool. In it were letters home from Illingworth George Gower, a local lad who had fought in the Great War. Though deceptively simple and sometimes even mundane, they slowly revealed the powerful reality and the devastating effects of the war on both the young men who fought and the families they left behind. A year later, Hartlepool Borough Council acquired the war effects of the Jones brothers: Theo Jones is commemorated as the first soldier of the First World War to be killed on British soil, during the German bombardment of Hartlepool in 1914 - but it wasn't previously known that his mother also lost both of her younger sons to the war in France.</p>
<p>Your Affectionate Son was a new show commissioned for Hartlepool Folk Festival 2019, based on the stories of these young men. Featuring songs by Robb Johnson, spoken word by John Hegley, accompaniment by Durham Miners' Association Brass Band, contributions from Eliza Carthy, Jackie Oates, Luke Daniels, The Wilsons, Damien Barber and Jack Worth, and arrangements by Jonny Mohun, Your Affectionate Son was produced to commemorate the centenary of the Treaty of Versailles with music, song, dance, and the real voices of the men who fought in the War to End All Wars.</p>
<p>Following a hugely enthusiastic reception, and many requests during the festival and since, we have decided to produce an album of the show. It will feature the original cast, all of the songs and arrangements, and lots of accompanying material in a beautifully-produced CD package. It will also be available as a digital download.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What You Get</h3>
<p>There are several levels of reward, from downloads and hard-copy CDs (plus lots of gratitude and love!) To special perks, including VIP packages at Hartlepool Folk Festival 2020. </p>
<p>If we don't reach our target, we will put the funding towards the production of the album and recoup additional costs through post-production sales.</p>

<h2>Zenamon- A Chamber Music Collection </h2>
<p>      I was introduced to Jaime’s music early on when I first started studying classical guitar.  It wasn’t until I came to NYC in 2012 that I rediscovered his music by playing with cellist Mark Humburg.  I met Mark while I was studying at Mannes and he had music for Jaime’s piece for guitar and cello, Reflexoes no. 6.  I<span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">n another instance, Matt Pidi, my guitar duo partner from my Master’s program at Mannes asked me about another a guitar duo piece of Jaime’s: Suite Andina.  He had heard it played brilliantly on a recording by Julian Gray and Ronald Pearl and thought we could also do good work with it.  When we finally started to incorporate that piece into our regular recital programs - it was easily one of the most well-received pieces in every performance since. </span></p>
<p>    I first reached out to Jaime about his music because I lacked information that I wanted to give audiences about his inspiration behind the music. Receiving this information was extremely meaningful because music is all about communication.  I felt it strengthened my performances to a new level between me and my audience.</p>
<p>     There are a lot of factors that led me to work on this project.  For instance, I stopped learning new music after my time at Mannes and found myself focusing on technique, taking my time to learn music right.  This is because I feel that confidence and security in playing are always correlated with your confidence in practice and preparation. Previously, I just didn’t have that. Spending time away from my instrument, I set up new and healthier habits.  I also invested in a new instrument crafted by a science-driven luthier, Gary Lee whose knowledge and skill set for guitar-making is fueled by his passion for music.  Previously, I hadn’t even felt confident in my sound.</p>
<p>     Part of my story is New York City and coming here for music. I wanted to keep that as part of the album—the story of the album. I could not do it alone. I’m super grateful for meeting a host of musicians along the way.   <span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">And the outcome is really just that —it’s easy to feel singular as a musician in New York.  I wanted to share what’s something I’m proud of. I want this album to be an expressive representation of myself in spirit of collaboration. I want this to be remembered because I don’t think this have ever been done— the chamber music of Jaime Zenamon all on one album. I would be proud to represent his music.</span></p>
<p>    I resonate with this music. Jaime is able to tell a story with his music.  It’s different and it’s accessible. People who have a perception of what classical guitar is will be surprised by how wide ranging the pieces are. </p>
<p>    Will you support me, Jaime Zenamon, and my NYC colleagues in creating a worthwhile piece of art? </p>

<p>Hey everyone! Over a year after the release of our last single “Rodeo” and our main stage performance with Lifehouse at The QuickChek Ballooning Festival, we’ve decided that it's finally time to bring you some brand new music! For the past 7 months, we’ve been preparing a variety of anthemic, powerful, and infectiously catchy pop rock songs for our project’s second ever full length album. We’re finally ready to step into the studio and record what we’ve done, but first, we need your help to make it happen!</p>
<p>In order to create an album at the level of quality we feel these songs deserve, we’re pulling out all the stops: professional recording sessions, top of the line studio production / post production, amazing artwork, and packaging worthy of the material. This is going to be a professional release in every way possible, so you can be assured that this album will sound incredible.</p>
<p>To get to our goal of $10,000, we’ve created an Indie GoGo campaign which includes a variety of exclusive items. These include pre-release distributions, unique merch, autographed material, among others.</p>
<p>Your support over the years has proven to us that this project is worth pursuing, and that delivering the highest possible quality product is something that you, the fans, deserve.</p>
<p>That being said, thank you for being there for us: for buying our music, watching our videos, coming out to our shows, and just simply loving and supporting us on social media. We don’t take what you’ve given us for granted, because without you, this project would never exist at this level. We hope that you continue to put your trust in us, and in return, we will give you everything we have to provide you with the best album we’ve ever written.</p>

Music was the ""path not taken"" until I reached my mid-thirties, when I discovered that one can only evade one's calling for so long before the ""itch"" of that unfulfilled passion grows too intense to ignore! Scratching that unrelenting itch, I made the leap from a well-established career in corporate marketing to a brand new career in music in 2016. I moved to L.A. I began performing regularly; taking workshops; resuming the study of music that I'd abandoned at 18; and gradually, growing my network of fans, fellow musicians, and industry folk. And, I established a brand for the music that best encapsulates my musical taste, performance style, and personality: “Firecracker Jazz”.</p><p>I'm excited about the progress I've made in just two and a half years, and even more excited about the milestones yet to come. Right now, I'm heading towards a particularly huge milestone: recording my first album! I'm incredibly lucky to have some of the industry's best talent involved in the making of this record, including Jane Monheit (a jazz icon) as a Producer and some of L.A.'s most in-demand jazz musicians recording with me.<br/> </p><h3>MY VISION FOR “FIRECRACKER JAZZ – THE EP”</h3><p>Making an album is an enormous – and costly – undertaking. However, being ever the business-minded professional from my earlier life, I would not be continuing to “leap” in the direction of this unpredictable artistic career if I didn’t have a deep belief that my musical gifts can add value, move people, and ultimately, be a contribution to the art form. This belief has been affirmed by the reception and support I’ve seen thus far, and I’m fully fired-up to continue creating the best work I can with this record.</p><p>My debut album will be an EP (which, for those who are wondering, stands for “extended play”: longer than an LP, shorter than a full-length record), containing five or six tracks. (The sixth may be reserved as a “bonus track” for later release.) It will combine the stylistic elements that have come to define me as a singer,  The songs will cross genre lines a bit: fundamentally jazz, but blended with flavors of Pop, Funk, Soul, and Blues. There will be no original compositions on this album, but there will be some unique interpretations of both beloved jazz standards and lesser-known musical gems.<br/> </p><h3>WHAT I’M ASKING</h3><p>Your support is essential in making this vision a reality! In contributing to this campaign, you’ll – first and foremost – be helping to create a fantastic piece of art. (And let’s face it: art wouldn’t really exist without support like this… And what is a world without art??) You will also have my eternal gratitude. But, in an effort to offer as much value and reward for your contribution as possible, I’ve put together packages of perks and exclusives for different levels of pledges. Among these perks are services that I will personally render, using the skills that were heavily developed in my first career as a marketing professional – namely, graphic design. I hope these perks will help express my desire to give back and my deep gratitude for every one of you that helps me make this record happen!</p><p>If you’re excited by the vision and want to be part of its realization, I invite you to:</p><ul>

<h3>The Project</h3>
<p>BETA Quartet is celebrating the exciting news that we have been invited to perform at the 2020 <a href=""https://lowflutesfestival.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">International Low Flutes festival</a> in Japan! We have also organized an educational and community outreach tour in the Tokyo-area.</p>
<p>We will be partnering with flutists Ryota Fukae and Izak Kertznus for this cross-cultural collaboration. Our program, ""Around the World in 30 minutes,"" will feature new works and world premieres for flute sextet. The works are composed by international living composers hailing from Greece, South Korea, Colombia, Japan, the Netherlands, and the United States. Two of the works have been commissioned by and will be dedicated to BETA.  </p>
<p>This project is valuable because it brings performers and composers of different cultural and musical backgrounds together to promote new music inspired by various parts of our world. It also helps support our vision of educating others through music. You are helping enrich the body of repertoire written for flute sextet while allowing us to reach a larger audience with our music through an educational and community outreach tour.</p>

<h3><strong>What Happens If the Funds are Not Raised?</strong></h3>
<p>We are so excited for the opportunity to work with artists from around the world and promote new music!  If we could fund this project ourselves, we would. However, with many of us just starting our careers, we are unable to do so.  Let's keep it real, we are musicians after all.</p>
<p>If we do not manage to raise the necessary funds then we will not be able to complete the project, and you will have the choice to either get your money back OR allow us to use your donation.</p>

</div><p> </p></div>","The Project
BETA Quartet is celebrating the exciting news that we have been invited to perform at the 2020 International Low Flutes festival in Japan! We have also organized an educational and community outreach tour in the Tokyo-area.
We will be partnering with flutists Ryota Fukae and Izak Kertznus for this cross-cultural collaboration. Our program, ""Around the World in 30 minutes,"" will feature new works and world premieres for flute sextet. The works are composed by international living composers hailing from Greece, South Korea, Colombia, Japan, the Netherlands, and the United States. Two of the works have been commissioned by and will be dedicated to BETA.  
This project is valuable because it brings performers and composers of different cultural and musical backgrounds together to promote new music inspired by various parts of our world. It also helps support our vision of educating others through music. You are helping enrich the body of repertoire written for flute sextet while allowing us to reach a larger audience with our music through an educational and community outreach tour.


How do we make this happen?
Every dollar counts! To bring this project to fruition we need your help to cover airfare tickets, lodging, transportation, and per diem expenses for six performers.
We are looking for a total of $10,000: 
Airfare tickets: $5,000

​Each round-trip airfare ticket from the United States to Tokyo costs approximately $1,000.  Five of the performers are flying out from the US and will meet the sixth performer in Tokyo. 
Lodging: $2,500

This is the total cost for AirBnB lodging from March 17 to March 25, 2020 for six performers. Rehearsals and preparation will take place in this space. 
Location: Edogawa City, Tokyo
Transportation: $480

$72
Three members of the ensemble will be purchasing a Suica card to have access to public transportation while in Japan. The other three members already own this card.
To learn more about the Suica card: https://www.japan-rail-pass.com/services/suica-...
$86
Round-trip airport transfer from Narita International Airport to AirBnb
$22
Ryota Fukae’s Round-trip Airport Transfer
$50 x 6 people = $300
The Suica card will need to be loaded with money (similar to the New York MetroCard) in order to be valid. Additional expected expenses during our 10-day trip are $50 per person.
Our daily transportation will also include traveling from the AirBnB to the Urayasu Concert Hall and other performance venues included in our tour (TBD).   
Festival Registration Fees: $636

Each member of the ensemble has to pay the registration fee of $106 in order to perform at the festival.
Ryota Fukae: $300

This amount will be used towards covering Ryota Fukae's airfare ticket expenses from Akashi, Hyogo to Tokyo.
Per Diem: $1,100

​​This amount will be used solely on everyday food expenses for the duration of our travels in Japan. Each individual will receive the total amount of $220 for a 10-day trip in Japan ($22/per day).

CD's shipped to your house
Flute ensemble arrangements

What Happens If the Funds are Not Raised?
We are so excited for the opportunity to work with artists from around the world and promote new music!  If we could fund this project ourselves, we would. However, with many of us just starting our careers, we are unable to do so.  Let's keep it real, we are musicians after all.
If we do not manage to raise the necessary funds then we will not be able to complete the project, and you will have the choice to either get your money back OR allow us to use your donation.

Described as ""chamber music at its finest"" by Kenneth Tse and ""unique and virtuosic"" by Barbara Siesel, BETA Quartet is an award-winning ensemble comprised of flutists Eftihia Arkoudis, Tatiana Cassetta, Alyssa Schwartz, and Meg Brennan. 
BETA is dedicated to exploring and promoting the cutting edge of modern flute music by premiering and performing works by living composers from around the world. The ensemble is actively engaged through concerts, masterclasses, and educational outreach across the country and abroad.
As strong competitors, the group has won First Prize at the West Virginia Music Teachers National Association Chamber Music Competition, First Prize at the Flute Society of Kentucky Quartet Competition, and advanced to the semi-finals of the prestigious Fischoff National Chamber Music Competition. They have performed and presented workshops at the National Flute Association Convention, Florida Flute Association Convention, the Mid-Atlantic Flute Convention, the Flute Society of Greater Philadelphia, and the International Flute Symposium.
BETA’s activities have been partially funded by grants from The Friends of Flutes Foundation and West Virginia University, and their recognition within the flute community resulted in sponsorship by Flute Specialists, Inc.

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Short Summary</h3>
<p>Here we are again. Over 3 years after the release of 'Stitched in Fiction' we have written, practiced again and again, and recorded another 2 whole CD's worth of material and we are dying to get it to you! This project has seen a long road. We started recording in March 2017 and we feel the end result represents a major achievement of what we as a band have achieved so far in our 6+ years playing music. It is certainly the culmination of many challenges, and we are confident in saying it is our most polished and high quality work.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
</div><div>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Basically, we hit some hurdles in funding toward the end of this project, and need some help. We are hoping to raise $5000 because a project like this has a lot of expense. What specifically? Well, in part the many studio recording hours at Lane Gibson Studios in Charlotte, epic artwork contribution from local airbrush master Ron Hernandez, mixing and mastering time, graphic design, and physical production of the CD's. All of this really adds up for musicians who (sadly) don't (yet!) make a livelihood doing what they love.</p>
<p>We are super grateful for anything you can give, and will make it worth your while. Even if you can't give, please share this page on social media or with your friends, every little bit helps! Even if we don't reach our entire goal, we are hoping to stretch our personal piggy-banks to get the album into your hands on October 27th.</p>

<p>Casco Bay Wind Symphony (CBWS) is a non-profit, non-auditioned adult community band with a mission to perform high quality wind band literature, commission new works and to support wind band education throughout our community.</p>
<p>Our campaign targets raising funds for being a part of a consortium that commissioned a composition by John Mackey that honors those who have been affected by dementia and Alzheimer’s. It will be performed as part of our 40th Anniversary concert for which we have invited the University of Southern Maine’s School of Music Concert Band to participate. This performance will be the New England premiere of this major new work for wind band.</p>
<p>Donors will be helping CBWS perform a historical concert at Merrill Auditorium in Portland Maine that will support our vision of supporting wind band education as well as develop awareness of our local dementia and Alzheimer’s community organizations.</p>
</div><div>
<p>In this campaign, CBWS is looking to raise $5,000 to cover the costs associated with the commissioning and performance of John Mackey’s newest work inspired by his mother’s sudden onset of dementia. This includes paying the consortium cost, bringing John Mackey to Maine as an Artist in Residence for CBWS and area schools, and creating a community event that will include educational collaboration with local dementia &amp; Alzheimer’s organizations on the evening of the performance.</p>
<p>We have created several perks which include VIP access to our dress rehearsal with John Mackey, VIP access to post concert reception, being a guest conductor at a future CBWS concert, and many more!</p>
<p>If the goal is not fully met, funds will be prioritized to the commissioning of the work first.</p>
</div><div>
<p>CBWS is reaching beyond our traditional performances in a high school auditorium to a major concert hall with special guests and a Maine premiere of a major new work for concert band. We are also reaching beyond the scope of our musical endeavors to become part of the larger community through the inclusion of local organizations that support families and individuals living with dementia-related illness.</p>
<p>CBWS has hosted local band festivals in the past with much success, and has proven itself to be a viable, popular community ensemble with a dedicated following for forty years. Now with this larger event, CBWS is working to overcome the financial hurdles through grant writing, fundraising campaigns and collaboration with local organizations. Our ensemble is very large, so members and friends/family are exploring contacts, promoting the event, utilizing grant-writing expertise, employing marketing skills used in our non-music careers, and networking with musicians and music educators throughout the area.</p>
<p>We are approaching the challenges of this performance event and dementia outreach by striving for excellence in the concert, directly targeting local educational organizations (through the inclusion of the University of Southern Maine music program and local high schools), and using the experience, skills, and contacts of the Merrill Auditorium and its ticket sellers to a much larger market area. CBWS members are also volunteering their time and talents in the writing of grants, selling program advertising to local organizations, and soliciting support from area businesses and agencies.</p>

<h3> </h3>
<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>WHO WE ARE:</p>
<p>The company, <i><strong>Fifth Wall Performing Arts</strong></i> is confronting: calling into question the institutions of performative art-making by dismantling the suspension of disbelief and by creating work that is personal, intimate, and unabashed. As an interdisciplinary performance collective, Fifth Wall produces works of opera, theatre, and music that call into question the nature of what it means to perform both “in character” and as oneself, and by what means—  what vessel, what landscape— stories, histories, and mythologies are shared. </p>
<p>WHAT THIS IS:</p>
<p>Our inaugural production, <i><strong>Michigan Trees: A Guide to the Trees of Michigan and the Great Lakes Region</strong></i>, is a new opera for folk and classical singers that follows the journey of Orna, a trans-woman, as she grapples with self-acceptance. She travels to the north of Michigan, guided by the Mother of Trees, and transforms into the white pine that sits upon Chapel Rock, on the edge of Lake Superior, overlooking it all.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>If this work excites you and you’d like to see new and groundbreaking art by up-and-coming artists, we’d love to have some help in making this establishing project happen!</p>
<p>WHERE THE MONEY GOES: We need help purchasing our props, compensating our performers, renting the Ypsilanti Freighthouse space, documenting the performance, and funding our transportation to NYC. Additional funds go towards building our website, audio equipment, and printing a chapbook of the libretto!</p>
<p>We've already received an EXCEL Grant from the University of Michigan in collaboration with Converge New Music, and are raising what we need to fill in the gaps.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<ul>
<li>Our work bridges the gap between contemporary music and folk-style singing, as well as intimate and abstract works of theater.</li>
<li>After our previous production of Einstein in the HOUSE (our adaptation of Philip Glass and Robert Wilson's Einstein on the Beach for an Ann Arbor living room), we want to start bringing original works by our team into production! </li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
</div><div><h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3></div><div>
<p>If you can't contribute, but want to help:</p>

The company, Fifth Wall Performing Arts is confronting: calling into question the institutions of performative art-making by dismantling the suspension of disbelief and by creating work that is personal, intimate, and unabashed. As an interdisciplinary performance collective, Fifth Wall produces works of opera, theatre, and music that call into question the nature of what it means to perform both “in character” and as oneself, and by what means—  what vessel, what landscape— stories, histories, and mythologies are shared. 
WHAT THIS IS:
Our inaugural production, Michigan Trees: A Guide to the Trees of Michigan and the Great Lakes Region, is a new opera for folk and classical singers that follows the journey of Orna, a trans-woman, as she grapples with self-acceptance. She travels to the north of Michigan, guided by the Mother of Trees, and transforms into the white pine that sits upon Chapel Rock, on the edge of Lake Superior, overlooking it all.
 

What We Need & What You Get
If this work excites you and you’d like to see new and groundbreaking art by up-and-coming artists, we’d love to have some help in making this establishing project happen!
WHERE THE MONEY GOES: We need help purchasing our props, compensating our performers, renting the Ypsilanti Freighthouse space, documenting the performance, and funding our transportation to NYC. Additional funds go towards building our website, audio equipment, and printing a chapbook of the libretto!
We've already received an EXCEL Grant from the University of Michigan in collaboration with Converge New Music, and are raising what we need to fill in the gaps.
 

The Impact

Our work bridges the gap between contemporary music and folk-style singing, as well as intimate and abstract works of theater.
After our previous production of Einstein in the HOUSE (our adaptation of Philip Glass and Robert Wilson's Einstein on the Beach for an Ann Arbor living room), we want to start bringing original works by our team into production! 

 
Other Ways You Can Help
If you can't contribute, but want to help:

Ask folks to get the word out and make some noise about our campaign!

<h3>Our Story + The Vision</h3>
<p>Our dream for Hollerhorn Distilling was to create a cultural hub in the heart of the Finger Lakes region. A place to celebrate and highlight the bounty of the area through good food, amazing cocktails and spirits, and by bringing in some of the best artists and musicians from around the country. As many of you know well, we were off to a great start! </p>
<p>This year has obviously been extremely difficult for so many, and has impacted all of us. We have done the best we can in pivoting to make sanitizer for the community during the lockdown, and by taking a very slow, thoughtful approach to reopening as safely as possible.  We have been scrambling like so many businesses to stay afloat, try and adapt, and grow in new inventive ways in order to survive. The loss of all musical events has been the biggest hurdle for us here. We are asked every week <strong>“when is the music coming back?”</strong> and we are here trying our best to answer your call and bring the magic back.</p>
<p>Not only has Hollerhorn been greatly impacted by the lack of events here, but also the entire community that thrives on it. So many of us are local artists and musicians, and so many of our brilliant friends have performed here these last 2 years. They have been hurt tremendously by this situation, and by the lack of outdoor venues practicing safe distancing guidelines. This is a big reason for this fundraiser, and <strong>our goal to build an outdoor music venue by next summer!</strong></p>
<p>We have been racing to navigate the next pivot, the next shut down, and the next wave of this pandemic before it catches us off guard again. This fundraising effort is our best way forward toward a future that is hopeful, healthy, inspiring, and brimming with vibrant live events again! </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We built Hollerhorn with our own hands, with every penny we could save, beg, or borrow, and we are at a point where we must grow to survive. We need to find a safe way to bring events and people back to our area, as well as a way to expand the space and capacity of our entire model. From seating capacity and service, to barrel warehousing and parking, this is our attempt to help address, and move forward in solving these needs. <strong>Every dollar raised will be used for materials to build the stage and underlying barrel storage for our spirits. </strong></p>
<p>We have come up with some fun rewards for your support of this next step, (hello super delicious holiday cocktail kits, limited edition whisky, private mixology classes, oh my!) as well as some great ways to literally make a mark here permanently - from the stainless steel “Stage Supporter”plaques, to the actual naming of the stage.  We have many fun ways for you all to be recognized, celebrated, and forever infused into the great spirit of Hollerhorn!</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Getting the word out will be crucial for our fundraiser.  Please tell your friends and neighbors.  Shout if from the rooftops! You can share our campaign page with ease using the Indiegogo sharing links for e-mail, Facebook and Twitter.  Spreading the word would mean the world to us!</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>With Gratitude</h3>
<p>We are so thankful for all of you, all of your support these last few years, and for your continued support of what we strive to do! <strong>“Raising Spirits in the Finger Lakes”</strong> is the mantra we hold in mind everyday, and we hope to continue to push to greater heights in the coming years! Lots of love and gratitude from all of us here, to all of you! We look forward to seeing you all back here soon!</p>

<p><strong>ART FOR THE EARS</strong></p>
<p>by Mike Blakely</p>
<p>What drives a young songwriter to the terrifying act of standing in front of an audience to perform an original song for the first time?  Most couldn’t even tell you.  It’s just an aching “want-to” to release something that’s fighting to get out of them.  Not even the fear of public embarrassment can dissuade them.  I remember feeling that way decades ago.</p>
<p>But now, after 45 years in the music business, nerves seldom get to me on stage and instead of feeling swept up by some mysterious urge to perform, I have developed an understanding of my life’s purpose and why it is worthwhile.  If I can write, perform and record a song that helps someone forget a nagging worry for a while or takes one’s imagination on a fascinating trip to a far away place and time or brings about a laugh or a sigh or a tear, then I have succeeded beyond any measure of wealth or fame.  It’s my calling to create those escapism experiences for music lovers.</p>
<p>With much joy and anticipation I now endeavor to record my 14<sup>th</sup> album.  As always, I need partners to make this happen.  As with my last CD, <i>The Outside Circle</i>, I am sticking with the brilliant production team of Walt Wilkins and Ron Flynt at Ron's Jumping Dog Studio in Austin, Texas.  We established a track record of success with that album including two national awards. </p>
<p>With this funding campaign I now offer you the chance to be a part of our next musical adventure.  Unlike <i>The Outside Circle</i>, the new project, yet untitled, will not be a whole-hog cowboy and wild west musical project.  You might hear a track or two with a western flare, but the rest of the collection will fall into the Americana, country or folk-rock categories.  But regardless of genres, our dedication to creative excellence will remain the same.</p>
<p>So, if you believe what I have come to embrace – that music is healing and uplifting; that it is not only important but <i>crucial</i> to a joyful life – then I invite you to partner with me and my team to have some fun and make some <i>art for the ears</i>. </p>

<h3>B2C: Bach Cello Suites Unleashed with Choir</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>I have always loved Bach, and as a cellist, especially his Six Suites for Solo Cello. Yet it seems that too often people feel like they don't have a ""way in"" to this glorious music... at first glance, it can appear too ""intellectual"" or ""dry,"" especially in a busy, technology-driven world in which our attention span is so short...</p>
<p>Since graduating from Indiana University Jacobs School of Music in 2009, it has been my dream to present this gorgeous music in a new context and to challenge listeners who may think they don't enjoy Bach with an alternative presentation that does allow them a ""way in."" My cello teachers would all tell me to ""hear the implied harmonies"" in the music... the idea of combining the solo cello suites with choir always seemed very natural to me... a realization of what is already there (with a little artistic license, of course, please forgive me, Johann*!). </p>
<p>And so when I recorded Bach's Six Cello Suites at St. Paul's Cathedral in 2017 and had the opportunity to meet the cathedral's wonderful choir director, Martin Green, I just couldn't resist the idea of proposing my idea to him... The creation of an album of Bach's Cello Suites Nos.1 and 3 alongside an original choral arrangement --with the talented St. Paul's choristers. Luckily for me, Martin loved the idea, and here we are!</p>
<p>In order to help bring this project to fruition, a number of people are volunteering their time, and St. Paul's Cathedral is very generously allowing us to record in their beautiful space pro bono. We have been able to reduce or cut costs in a number of areas, but are still in need of considerable funding to bring this project to completion (our expenses are listed below in ""Risks and Challenges"").</p>
<p>This is the reason we have created this campaign... any financial support you are able to give to help bring ""B2C: Bach Cello Suites Unleashed"" to light would be incredibly appreciated! We hope you will take a moment to watch our campaign video and to browse our thank you gifts. This campaign is an ""all or nothing campaign"" which means we have to reach our funding goal or we get nothing. Any help you can give in spreading the word about our campaign would also be much appreciated.</p>
<p>Thank you so much for your time and consideration of support for ""B2C: Bach Cello Suites Unleashed."" Together, we can help bring classical music to a broader audience, both nationally and internationally, with a goal to communicate both with current classical music-lovers, and also with people who may not find classical music readily accessible today. </p>
<p>We literally couldn't do it without you! &lt;3</p>
<p>In gratitude,</p>
<p>Sophie</p>
<p>*It was very important to me to keep the writing minimal and uncluttered, with each notational choice stemming from Bach's original composition. </p> <p>P.S. If successfully funded, all backers of this project will receive updates about the project as it progresses, including short video and photographic documentation. </p>
<p> </p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>

<li>Help bring classical music to a wider audience</li>
<li>Support innovation in the the arts, and classical music in particular!</li>

Any help you can give in spreading the word about our campaign would also be much appreciated.
Thank you so much for your time and consideration of support for ""B2C: Bach Cello Suites Unleashed."" Together, we can help bring classical music to a broader audience, both nationally and internationally, with a goal to communicate both with current classical music-lovers, and also with people who may not find classical music readily accessible today. 
We literally couldn't do it without you! <3
In gratitude,
Sophie
*It was very important to me to keep the writing minimal and uncluttered, with each notational choice stemming from Bach's original composition.  P.S. If successfully funded, all backers of this project will receive updates about the project as it progresses, including short video and photographic documentation.

This is for those of you who came late to the party. Life happens. I get it. But you still want to pre-order my EP or contribute in some way so this is where you can do that!</h3></div><div>
<p>Now here's the story:</p>
<p>Hi, I'm Jenny Bruce, a New York City independent singer-songwriter. I've released 3 full albums and an EP, and I'm deeply proud of that body of work.  </p>
<p>As ""Jenny Bruce"" I am also a wife, a mother of two boys, a full-time Communications Director, a grad-school student, and caregiver for my father who is in the end stages of Parkinson's.  </p>
<p>Immersed in the layers of a wonderful, busy, full life, I realized that the artist in me was slowly becoming invisible. That triggered a memory of my mother telling me repeatedly that, ""At 50, you become invisible. Nobody sees you or listens to you anymore.""  </p>
<p>One night, I had a very lucid dream. In it I was on stage. The lighting was dim and electric blue. A voice introduced me as ""GHOSTE"" and as it did, I saw the word (with the “E”) projected in bright letters behind me.  </p>
<p>I woke up.  </p>
<p>And I made a choice. At 52, I will not be invisible. Or ignored. The artist in me has a voice. That voice is GHOSTE! </p>
<p>The E is silent. I am not.</p>
<p>It has been freeing to write and record in the blue glow of GHOSTE and the songs I've written for this EP are brimming with passion, melancholy, joy, and longing. Gifted producer and composer, Matt Anthony, brings his innovative textures and sounds (sampling a loon! - how a propos) and his boundless enthusiasm and creativity to the mix!</p>
<p>***Are you with me so far? This is where I really need YOU!***</p>
<p>To continue recording, mixing, mastering, duping and promoting the songs for this new EP I need to raise funds. I've set my goal at $7000 as that would cover SOME of the costs of making this EP... The actual cost is twice that! </p>
<p>This is a little backward design in action. If you're not familiar with BD, it a model we use in education and it works! The goal is to release this music and share it with as many people as possible. However, in order to do that without a record label and the budget and PR machine that come with, I am reaching out to YOU to give GHOSTE wings!</p>
<p>Why did I set my goal lower than what I need? I'm comfortable taking creative risks, but I'd be a lousy venture capitalist! If I don't meet my goal, I don't receive any of the funds so I'm playing it ""safe."" I hope. On the other hand, if I exceed my goal, oh, the wonderful things I can do!!!</p>
<p>Any extra funds will help me cover the REAL costs of recording, mixing, mastering, duping, maybe even printing some vinyl, and getting real photos taken.  I am the artist, and my own webmaster, and graphic designer... However, hard as I try, I can't do it all on my own! At least not well.</p>
<p>Music is my passion and I'm so grateful to you for helping make that happen and for giving my music greater meaning. Connection is everything. I make the music because I need, but it becomes meaningful when you listen and connect with me. </p>
<p>Thank you so much!</p>
<p>Enjoy these silly, spooky outtakes. Days of recording tossed onto the virtual cutting room floor... </p>
<p>GHOSTE or just plain ghost? </p>
<p>There are many beautiful things about being a mature human. One is truly grasping the precious, precarious nature of life. Another is understanding the absurdity of our existence and being able to laugh at it all! I have never felt more alive or more creative!</p>
<p>Let's prove definitively that creativity doesn't diminish with age and that GHOSTE(s) truly exists! Support my first EP as - GHOSTE! </p>
<p>Thank you for supporting my campaign by contributing or sharing this. I am deeply grateful for your faith in me and am forever in your debt.</p>

<p><strong>RISKS AND CHALLENGES</strong></p>
<p>Four songs are nearly completed and I anticipate having a six-song EP ready to distribute digitally in July! I am working with familiar vendors and I don't anticipate any hiccups there either. The official release is slated for October. Barring acts of God, I don't see any impediment to my delivering all rewards as promised. The Ghost-Hunt reward will depend on your availability. There is a great deal of flexibility on my end and on the venue's part.</p>
<p>Back to the acts of God, my father has been very ill for a very long time. That is a big unknown. But I will make all best efforts to honor my timelines in any event.</p>

<p>Life can take a turn, and what you thought you would always do is not what you find yourself doing. When I was in my mid 20’s I took a break from my life as a touring musician, opening for the likes of Odetta, John Gorka, and the Indigo Girls; a break that lasted the better part of 25 years. “Two roads diverged in a yellow wood, And sorry I could not travel both” as Robert Frost wrote. Then, one sultry evening in the summer of 2018, I found myself at an open mic. By the end of the night, I was singing again. Four months later, to my surprise, I was writing songs again. An evolution of style had occurred while I had been busy living my life and the connection I had to music was more potent. The words flowed onto the page. My guitar playing was more fluid. I felt more capable of expressing. I had traveled a road of challenges and sacrifice that informed my music with a depth only achieved through life experience.</p>
<p>I wrote 40 plus songs in a year, 11 of which are on this record. In the words and melodies are the stories of my adult life: the passing of my mother, the dissolution of a 20 year marriage, my discovery and exploration of meditation, new love, and the essence of the sacred in everything and everyone. Writing the songs for “Brave New View” was my safe harbor; my rise out of the proverbial ash pile. Tracy Walton, who is producing the album with me, has referred to this record as my Phoenix Rising. I’d love to have your help getting it to take flight.</p>
<p>I’m looking forward to you hearing it! In this challenging era we all find ourselves in, my wish is that  the album will offer healing and joy to many. I’d be forever grateful for your help on the home stretch. </p>

This May, The Calla Quartet will be performing in the Fischoff National Competition Quarterfinals in Indiana this spring. Calla has been selected to participate in the 2015 Perlman Music Program Chamber Music Workshop with Merry Peckham. Following the Workshop, the quartet has been invited to perform at the Mimir Chamber Music Festival as part of the Emerging Artists program. Mimir will be located in Fort Worth, Texas and Melbourne, Australia this summer. Calla performed at the Norton Simon Museum’s Musical Compositions series in November 2014, presenting works by Bartok, Ravel, Haydn, and Tchaikovsky. This February, they worked with Colburn's Theater Chair Debbie Devine to reach over 1,500 elementary school children through interactive performances at Zipper Hall. Calla has also been featured in several private performances for donors of The Colburn School. The quartet will return to perform a second full recital at the Sierra Madre Playhouse on April 19th at 7:00pm. The Calla Quartet is coached by Martin Beaver, Clive Greensmith, and Arnold Steinhardt.</p>

My name is Ed Carlsen and I am a 26-year-old London-based composer. I have decided to start a crowdfunding campaign to support my five-track debut EP, 'The Journey Tapes', out in early 2016. </p><p>'The Journey Tapes' is indeed a brief summary of the journey that has led me to create these fresh songs; in fact, just like a real journey, life has got me in touch with so many different influences and styles that shaped me as a musician.</p><p>Throughout my life, I played many different musical genres, including classical, metal, rock, reggae, prog and more. I want to bring the energy that is typical of a rock track to meet the unbounded solutions of experimentation, thus creating a fresh and enjoyable mix.</p><p>Lately, I have approached the world of music production, which made me realise how to better combine the needs of both the musician and the guy who sits behind the console. Thanks to my studies, I have had the opportunity to explore electronic instruments, synthesisers and MIDI operations. This is why I feel the need to deliver you all a product that includes both the acoustic and the electronic sides of music. It's a real challenge, as it's entirely experimental, but still keeping the harmonic dimension as the pivotal point.</p><p>Along with the audio production, each track will be fitted with its own video, realised by talented filmmakers and animators.

My name is Ed Carlsen and I am a 26-year-old London-based composer. I have decided to start a crowdfunding campaign to support my five-track debut EP, 'The Journey Tapes', out in early 2016. 'The Journey Tapes' is indeed a brief summary of the journey that has led me to create these fresh songs; in fact, just like a real journey, life has got me in touch with so many different influences and styles that shaped me as a musician.Throughout my life, I played many different musical genres, including classical, metal, rock, reggae, prog and more. I want to bring the energy that is typical of a rock track to meet the unbounded solutions of experimentation, thus creating a fresh and enjoyable mix.Lately, I have approached the world of music production, which made me realise how to better combine the needs of both the musician and the guy who sits behind the console. Thanks to my studies, I have had the opportunity to explore electronic instruments, synthesisers and MIDI operations. This is why I feel the need to deliver you all a product that includes both the acoustic and the electronic sides of music. It's a real challenge, as it's entirely experimental, but still keeping the harmonic dimension as the pivotal point.Along with the audio production, each track will be fitted with its own video, realised by talented filmmakers and animators. The visual aspect will have an important role, as making the image emerge through sound is one of the things I enjoy the most.I wouldn’t tag my music as being one genre only, but I’d say it’s a mixture of modern classical, electronic and ambient music. Composing can be a real challenge, but I think it’s crucial to bear in mind the importance of making music whenever there is a story to tell. Right now, I have a story in mind and I couldn’t be more excited to tell you all! (photo by Kristine Norlander - www.kristinenorlander.com)   About EdI decided that music would have been my lifelong companion when I listened to The Eagles’ ‘Tequila Sunrise’ for the first time.

<span>Hi everyone! My name is Winston Barlow and I am a musician from Viña del Mar, Chile. I’ve been playing and studying violin since I was 12.

<p><span>I have been busking with my violin on the streets of Viña del Mar for a year, and it has been a truly meaningful and fascinating experience, the connection with people, especially children is just amazing.

<p><span>On June 2015 I will be flying to London where this adventure will begin, expecting to reach more places and countries.

<p><b>Soloists

would so appreciate it! And please help spread the word too. It makes such a

exchange for your generosity and support!</p>
<p>We
are excited about bringing this project to fruition because it feels like the
culmination of many years of collaboration with other musicians, a real
community effort. One of the joys of music is playing it with other people, a
stimulating conversation! It's fun to imagine the coming together of all these
great artists. Going into the studio is always so rewarding, to be able to
record moments that just fly by in a live performance. The O-Tones have
recorded several CDs over the years (<a href=""http://theotones.com/?p=songs"">http://theotones.com/?p=songs</a>) and each
one gets more ambitious and rewarding. Moving forward in this musical journey
is so satisfying.</p>

<h3>CD Narváez - 2015</h3> <p></p>
<p>Después de un largo, pero bien aprovechado receso, vuelvo al
estudio para emprender la aventura de un nuevo disco. Desde que se lanzó el
primero, hace cuatro años, un sinnúmero de sucesos diversos me llevaron a
replantear el abordaje de la música que hago, y en el camino me he reencontrado
con la tradición cultural de mi país de origen, Ecuador.</p>
<p><i>After a very helpful recess, we're going back to the recording studio in order to start a new CD album. Since we released the first one, four years ago, a lot of incidents made me reset my approach to music, and now I've found the cultural tradition of my birth country, Ecuador.</i></p>
<p> </p> </div> <div> <h3>Sobre el nuevo disco </h3> <p>
</p>
<p>A decir verdad, lo que me ha sucedido ha sido más un
maravilloso descubrimiento y un refrescante aprendizaje, que un
reencuentro.  Pese a que nací en la
capital ecuatoriana, la circunstancia de mi ascendencia colombiana primero y
las oportunidades vitales de mis padres después, me desconectaron del suelo
originario muy temprano y me destinaron a crecer entre dos culturas diferentes
de aquella que me puso en el mundo, de modo que llegué a conocer y vivir a Quito
cuando ya había cumplido los 10 años. Recuerdo el aterrizaje en la ciudad y los rostros de
la gente que nos esperaba en el aeropuerto; recuerdo sus manos llamando a mis
padres, y recuerdo sus ojos, que reían llorando por la emoción de volvernos a
encontrar. En medio de aquella vorágine que hoy me viene la mente con el
vértigo de una secuencia confusa de fotografías antiguas, yo tenía la sensación
de haber mudado de planeta: no reconocía paisajes, no entendía el dialecto, ni
encontraba un aroma familiar que me conectara con este nuevo mundo al que había
llegado. Solo entonces fui consciente de que en realidad jamás había
comprendido el significado de la palabra “volver”, que ahora flotaba abandonada
en el océano de mi cabeza de 10 años, cual náufrago a la deriva.</p>

Después de un largo, pero bien aprovechado receso, vuelvo al
estudio para emprender la aventura de un nuevo disco. Desde que se lanzó el
primero, hace cuatro años, un sinnúmero de sucesos diversos me llevaron a
replantear el abordaje de la música que hago, y en el camino me he reencontrado
con la tradición cultural de mi país de origen, Ecuador.
After a very helpful recess, we're going back to the recording studio in order to start a new CD album. Since we released the first one, four years ago, a lot of incidents made me reset my approach to music, and now I've found the cultural tradition of my birth country, Ecuador.
    Sobre el nuevo disco  

A decir verdad, lo que me ha sucedido ha sido más un
maravilloso descubrimiento y un refrescante aprendizaje, que un
reencuentro.  Pese a que nací en la
capital ecuatoriana, la circunstancia de mi ascendencia colombiana primero y
las oportunidades vitales de mis padres después, me desconectaron del suelo
originario muy temprano y me destinaron a crecer entre dos culturas diferentes
de aquella que me puso en el mundo, de modo que llegué a conocer y vivir a Quito
cuando ya había cumplido los 10 años. Recuerdo el aterrizaje en la ciudad y los rostros de
la gente que nos esperaba en el aeropuerto; recuerdo sus manos llamando a mis
padres, y recuerdo sus ojos, que reían llorando por la emoción de volvernos a
encontrar. En medio de aquella vorágine que hoy me viene la mente con el
vértigo de una secuencia confusa de fotografías antiguas, yo tenía la sensación
de haber mudado de planeta: no reconocía paisajes, no entendía el dialecto, ni
encontraba un aroma familiar que me conectara con este nuevo mundo al que había
llegado. Solo entonces fui consciente de que en realidad jamás había
comprendido el significado de la palabra “volver”, que ahora flotaba abandonada
en el océano de mi cabeza de 10 años, cual náufrago a la deriva.
Como yo tocaba la guitarra desde los siete, lo primero que
me interesó de este nuevo mundo fue conectarme con su música, y por inercia aprendí
lo que aprenden todos los niños de Quito: que la música del Ecuador es el
Pasillo, y que el emblema del pasillo ecuatoriano era un intérprete que murió
joven, a quien se conoció como “el ruiseñor”. Creo que jamás alguien ha cuestionado
aquello.
Todo lo que sucedió después del primer lanzamiento, tiene
que ver con cuestionar aquel mito de la música ecuatoriana. He descubierto un
nuevo país, en el que sí hay pasillo, pero que además tiene vals criollo, cumbia andina, y un
sinnúmero de músicas traídas del África en los siglos coloniales y adaptadas al
mestizaje de las diferentes regiones americanas. Aquí se quedaron ellas en las
formas del Andarele y de la Bomba y de los Arrullos y de las Décimas. 
Pero también se quedó el rock, que empezó a llegar desde los
60s, y que a medida que creció la industria de la música global dio paso a un
abanico impresionante de géneros que hoy coexisten aquí con los otros, y que van
del Pop al Metal como quien va de la cama al living. 
El disco que estamos produciendo hoy, es un compendio de
todo esto. Escribí las canciones que lo conformarán como una serie de historias
de diversa índole, tragedia y comedia, ficción y poesía, entre las que
se cuenta incluso alguna verdad del amor; y las compuse con los elementos del
país descubierto, pero también con el remanente de las músicas que aprendí
antes de llegar a Quito; como construyendo la brújula con la que una persona
podría navegar en este País de las Ultimas Cosas. De alguna manera, es el
regalo de bienvenida que le entregaría a aquel niño de 10 años que se vio
arrollado por la sorpresa de llegar a un lugar en el que –como en la novela de
Paul Auster- las cosas “desaparecen una a una y no vuelven nunca más”, y en
donde “el clima cambia de forma continua: un día de sol, seguido de uno de
lluvia; un día de nieve, luego uno de niebla; templado, después fresco; viento
seguido de quietud; un rato de frío intenso y… en pleno invierno, una tarde de
luz esplendorosa, tan cálida que no necesitas llevar más que un suéter.”
ABOUT THE NEW CD
I was born in Quito-Ecuador, but I didn,t live here until my tenth birthday. When I came here, I did not recognize the scenry, the dialect, the flavors or the smell of the air. Soon, I learned that the paradigm of ecuadorian music is the ""Pasillo"". 
In the last years I rediscovered that Ecuador is more than ""Pasillo"". It is, yes. But it also is Creole Waltz, Andean Cumbia, and a lot of afro-ecuadorian styles such as Andarele, Arullo, Décima and Bomba.
This new CD is my gift to that ten years old boy. It is a kind of a compass for navigate in Ecuador, my own Country of Last Things.

What is Honky Tonk music you may ask. Well its a mixture of country, rockabilly, blues, and bluegrass. I actually call my style of music ""Kentucky Fried Tonk"". I grew up in a very musical family. My grandpa was a Gene Autry disciple, my dad played bluegrass banjo, and I was lucky enough to be close friends with Bill Monroe and I spent most of my childhood backstage at the Grand Ole Opry. So, it's no wonder I have such a passion for American Roots music. </p>

<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">I have been a hard working music artist ever since my teens and I am so blessed to still be doing it today. I stay busy with writing and performing as a musician as well as being an actor and comedian. You can see me currently in Chicago at the Mercury Theatre playing Young Johnny Cash in the hit show ""Ring of Fire"", which is a musical about Johnny Cash's life and his music. I also spent two years with the successful Broadway show Million Dollar Quartet in Chicago and the national tour. Aside from acting in theatre and film I spend the rest of my time making music and making people laugh. I am a stand up comedian and improviser, and that certainly spills over into my songwriting as you can tell if you're familiar with my music.  </span></p>

<h3>Welcome!<br/>

<p>Hi,
my name is Eli.</p>
<p>I
am starting a permaculture studio, which is a place to explore
sustainable design and share those ideas online.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>I
have been researching permaculture and growing gardens since 2002. I
am interested in a wide array of sustainable living strategies from
growing food to building with the earth.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>I
have recently moved onto a 20 acre ranch in the beautiful high desert
of northern New Mexico.</p>
<p>This
is an opportunity to create something I've always wanted to create. A
place that explores natural systems while also sharing online with
video and feedback.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>It
will integrate the best of traditional systems with technology in  a
way that is efficient and selective.</p>
<h4>Why
a “studio” instead of a “farm”? 
</h4>
<p>Blue
Beetle is a place for small scale exploration on a family or
individual scale. Rather then producing large amounts of one crop, I
will produce modest amounts of many crops with a focus on nutrition.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Crops
with a high amino acid profile are of particular interest, including
amaranth, quinoa, chia seed and goji berries.</p>
<h4>Stage I<br/>
</h4>
<p></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>This
campaign represents Stage I, or the beginning of Blue Beetle Studio.
This year I will be focusing on plant acquisition, and the
establishment of a number of hardy shrubs and trees.</p>
<p>Once
established, they can then been multiplied both for additional
plantings around the property and also to share with local gardeners.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Plant
Species to be planted this year include:</p>
<p><i>Honeyberry, Bur
Oak, Honey
Locust, Elderberry,  Mulberry, Raspberry, Sea Buckthorn, Nanking
Cherry, Siberian
Pea Shrub, Asparagus,  Arctic
Kiwi, Goji
Berry, Serviceberry, Hazelnut, Apple, Asian Pear, Grapes and more..</i></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Annual
food crops will also be an important component to food production.</p>
<p>In
2015 I will be experimenting with grains like quinoa and amaranth, as
well as a number of tender vegetables(tomato, cucumber) and herbs.</p>
<h4>Stage II</h4>
<p>With plant systems established I will look to incorporating chickens and other components that will flesh out the system.<br/></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>This stage will see a turn towards earth building and other DIY projects including water filtration(slow sand filter), passive solar heating and other practical skills. 
</p>
<p>There
may be opportunities to bring in other members at this point and form
a small community working towards a common goal of exploring and
sharing online.</p>
<h4>Stage III </h4>
<p>
</p>
<p>The final stage, stage III represents a more complete system in which sub systems are
combined and a sustainable lifestyle is demonstrated.  Classes
can be held online live by webcam for interested teachers and students.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h4>Your
help is integral to getting Blue Beetle off the ground</h4>
<p>
</p>
<p>Your
contribution will help me with necessary gardening equipment
(including irrigation, tools, fencing, etc.), the purchase of trees
and shrubs(I also have many started from seed) and the filming,
editing, production and shipping of the DVD.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>For
contributors of $25 or more, I am producing a DVD at the end of the
growing season. This DVD will document events during the season and
it will include instructional videos on the following topics:</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><i>vermicomposting/worm
bin construction, worm
tea brewing, mushroom cultivation, seed
stratification, propagation
by cuttings</i></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Contributors
of $50 or more will get both the DVD and access to an exclusive
animal video(at least 1-hour long) which will include birds, insects
and other critters that show up during the growing season. 
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>If
you contribute $100 or more you will get all of the lower perks plus
I will send you a custom seed collection of both annuals and
perennials of at least 10 varieties which are suitable for your
growing zone.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Contributors
of $500 or more are true believers in the future of Blue Beetle
Studio so for this price you will receive every DVD or video that is
produced at Blue Beetle from now into the future, in addition to all
of the lower perks.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Contributors
of $1000 or more receive all of the above plus I will dedicate a
guild of plants in your name and create a monument declaring it so. You
will also go onto the list of founders for Blue Beetle Studio, and will be listed on all video productions as such.</p>
<p>And finally, with a contribution of $5000 or more you will become a partner and have input into Blue Beetle's development(plus receive all lower perks). You will also receive an all-expenses paid trip to visit the studio here in Taos, New Mexico. This perk will be available during Stage II or Stage III of the project.  You will be flown into Albuquerque and I will provide all transportation and food/lodging during your stay, which will be approximately 2-4 days.</p>
<h4>Exceed Goal?<br/>
</h4>
<p>Should I exceed my goal for this campaign, I will use the money to build a greenhouse, upgrade my camera and save for Stage II building projects.<br/></p>
<p>I would also like to have annual plant giveaways to local gardeners(sponsored by you)..  This would be a chance to spread useful plants throughout the local area. I will record ""thank you"" videos from them and share with you, the sponsors.<br/></p>

<p><b>Summary!</b></p>
<p>Hello!</p>
<p>My name is Joshua Romatowski and I am gearing up to
collaborate with some of North America’s top Baroque specialists to create a
wonderful recording of six flute sonatas by Swedish composer Johan Helmich
Roman.</p>
<p>These rarely recorded and performed pieces are full of
character and provide a unique experience for listeners.  Johan Helmich Roman was coined the “Swedish
Handel” and brings a multitude of unique and dazzling sounds and ideas to the
fore.  </p>
<p>Preparing these pieces has been an exquisite experience, and
I dream of being able to share my work with everyone I know!</p>
<p>As my first recording project, I am excited to pour all of
my energy into this and to make sure that it is well done.  That is why I have worked to find the best and
most experienced people to help me make this project a reality.</p>
