<h3>Abortion in Film</h3>
<p>The plot of <i>Friday Afternoon</i> revolves heavily around an abortion - the main character's abortion, based upon my own. </p>
<p>Despite the emotionally-charged, public debates surrounding reproductive rights, we only very rarely hear about women's <i>actual abortion stories</i>. We almost never see them represented in film and television, and when we do they are often unrealistic. When an estimated <strong>one third</strong> of women will have an abortion in their lifetimes, it's ridiculous that <strong>less than one hundred abortions</strong> have ever been portrayed on American network television, and even fewer in American movies.</p>
<p><i>Friday Afternoon</i> is a scripted drama, but it is <strong>my abortion story</strong>, and I want to tell it. By contributing to our fundraiser, you can help us to chip away at the stigma surrounding abortion in film. You can help us to normalize the experience of abortion, and to portray it as it is: common and safe.</p>
<p>(If you'd like to hear a little bit more about the way abortion figures into the plot of <i>Friday Afternoon</i>, check out the video below!)</p>

<h3>What We Need </h3>
<p>We are raising $15,000 for production of <i>Friday Afternoon</i>. All funds will go towards the practical costs of producing a film, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Equipment and location rentals</li>
<li>Costumes and props</li>
<li>Shooting permits and <strong>production insurance</strong>
</li>
<li>Catering and snacks for our cast and crew for our 10-day shoot </li>
</ul>
<p>Movies are very expensive! By raising this amount of money, we will be able to cover all of the costs mentioned above, and if through your generosity we happen to exceed our goal, any remaining funds will go towards post-production costs: picture and sound editing, color correction, titles, and festival fees.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Your Contribution</h3>
<p>We need <strong>you</strong>. Every film is a collaborative effort, shared among the creative team, the cast and crew, and the supporters. Please help <i>Friday Afternoon</i> by pledging your support. <strong>Donate now </strong>above (and pick out one of our exciting perks!) and <strong>share our campaign</strong> on Facebook or Twitter.  You can help us access the resources we need in order to make <i>Friday Afternoon</i> a reality.</p>
<p>This film is just one woman's story - one day in one woman's life, like any abortion is just one day in one woman's life. But stories are powerful, and through sharing this experience, we hope to support other women who want to share their own.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Making a film always means taking a risk. But there are definitely a few risks we have had to consider that are particular to <i>Friday Afternoon</i>.</p>
<p><strong>What about the content?</strong> It's no secret that abortion is a sensitive subject. We know that there will be people who will be upset by this movie, and maybe even by this campaign. But in a time when reproductive rights are under attack, it's more important than ever to tell stories like this one.   </p>
<p><strong>What if we don't raise all the money?</strong> Then we are going to work with what we have! We've set a flexible goal, meaning that this isn't an all-or-nothing deal - we keep what we raise, whether we raise the full amount or not. We're lucky to have a network of supportive friends and collaborators who will work with us on the more flexible costs, but with such a small budget, every dollar counts! That is why we really appreciate our supporters sharing the campaign on social media - even if a few people who wouldn't normally have seen it are able to donate, it really helps us.</p>

So you can support global or local causes, track your impact and feel good about the difference you're making, with total privacy, transparency and control, just by living your life.</p><p>We believe that by caring about what we do each day and understanding that we can make a positive impact, we can create a sustainable world and feel good.  So we created a real-time social responsibility platform that makes it easy for us all.  </p><p>You can set it and forget it or track your impact closely every day.   With Sustainably, know that you're doing good automatically, every time you buy on your cards or connected devices.

So you can support global or local causes, track your impact and feel good about the difference you're making, with total privacy, transparency and control, just by living your life.We believe that by caring about what we do each day and understanding that we can make a positive impact, we can create a sustainable world and feel good.  So we created a real-time social responsibility platform that makes it easy for us all.  You can set it and forget it or track your impact closely every day.   With Sustainably, know that you're doing good automatically, every time you buy on your cards or connected devices.

Through building a community of change-makers, together we will uncover, share, and scale up the pace of change for a future we want to live in and make lives better for today and for a better world tomorrow.Sustainably is a lifestyle choice - a new way of living and giving. And we want to celebrate all of you who are doing amazing things, (no matter how small or big) to help society and the environment thrive.We want to help you share your story and listen to others, and make our voices heard, to help spread awareness faster and give people access to the information they have been deprived of.We can use the power of our voices, and our daily choices, to create the kind of future we want to live in.  Together we can create a better world.By connecting your credit and debit cards in our app, you allow us to track your transactions. By signing up to round-ups, you give us permission to round-up your spare change and give it to the causes of your choice every time you make a transaction using your cards or connected devices.  To set up round-ups, select a good cause you want to support, and add the credit or debit card you wish to connect to your account. Then every time you shop on that credit or debit card or a connected device linked to it, you allow us to donate a round-up to your good causes.  Sustainably takes a 5% fee from gift aid to manage the platform. So if you are a UK taxpayer for every £1 you donate, you actually give £1.25 and Sustainably retains 6p, so a total of £1.19 will go to your charity.  The 6p is used to cover all the costs involved with running the platform from the awesome developers to the inspiring designers and content creators.  As a founders pledge, 10% of any profits made will go to the Sustainably Foundation which will support our '100x' and 'staff picks' causes. No, retailers don’t need to participate for you to be using round-ups. It’s completely retailer agnostic, which means that wherever you shop using a card connected to Sustainably, your round-ups will work. However, if a retailer is signed up to do-good matching on Sustainably you will get the benefit of match donations, which means that every time you shop at that retailer, they will give a donation to your chosen good causes. You will be able to see the amount matched by your retailer in your transaction history.We think that life should have a bit of fun in it so that’s why we are working on getting the best rewards on our platform. With Sustainably, every time you do good, you get an impact point. Impact points can be used to cash in for rewards. Rewards are either products and services from retailers you love. These will appear in the rewards section of your profile, and you will be able to cash them in either online or in-store at our retail partners.Every time you donate on Sustainably you get an impact point.

<p><i>It's a Rural Noir tale about </i> <i>a fashion photographer working on a portfolio called Murder-Site Modeling. He’s traveling the mid-west and tracing the trail of an infamous serial killer from the 80’s and reenacting the murders at the crime scenes with a tattooed, alternative Model in place of the victim.</i></p>
<p><i>When they reach the town of Buzzard Gulch, the site of the third murder, the townsfolk take offense to the Photographer’s lurid project and attempt to run him and his crew out of town.

</div></div>","We are a group of filmmakers from across the country who have joined together to bring this amazingly awesome film to life! 
Our kickass Director of Photography, Joel Hodge, is a master behind the lens. He shot the indie sensation Bellflower  which was accepted into SXSW and the Sundance Film Festival and went on to win multiple awards at various film festivals across the country. He was also the Director of Photography for the upcoming action-fiesta Chuck Hank and the San Diego Twins from Coatwolf Productions.

Last year, our Writer and Director, L.J. Dougherty, released his debut feature The Cylinder (now streaming on Amazon) - a darkly comedic tale about a group of modern-day duelists. L.J.'s previous screenplays have ranked high in competitions including the esteemed Austin Film Festival.

Hugo Velazquez, owner of Hugo V Photography has also come on board as a Technical Adviser. Hugo's stunning photography work has been featured in Inked Magazine, Inked Girls, Tattoo'd Lifestyle, and many more from around the world.

Along with the rest of the talented crew, we are determined to breathe life into Buzzard Gulch, the suspenseful tale of things gone wrong- or should we say, terribly wrong. We plan to showcase the gorgeous and highly underutilized scenery of Colorado, from it's purple mountains to it's dusty plains.
BUT without your help we CANNOT achieve this goal.
   
 

Buzzard Gulch is a sun bleached, suspense thriller that's gonna send your brain through a labyrinth full of twists, turns and ultra steep drops.
It's a Rural Noir tale about  a fashion photographer working on a portfolio called Murder-Site Modeling. He’s traveling the mid-west and tracing the trail of an infamous serial killer from the 80’s and reenacting the murders at the crime scenes with a tattooed, alternative Model in place of the victim.
When they reach the town of Buzzard Gulch, the site of the third murder, the townsfolk take offense to the Photographer’s lurid project and attempt to run him and his crew out of town. But things go horribly wrong when someone gets killed, forcing the Photographer and his team to fight for their lives to escape Buzzard Gulch alive!



Here's the deal:
Sure, pretty much anyone can shoot a movie with no money and an iphone these days- and our team consists of experts at low-budget film making who've done projects just like that- but we don't want to sacrifice the quality of this film.
To accomplish our epic action sequences, steep drops, and high octane thrills we need some more cash so we can make them look as legit and badass as they deserve to be! 
And that's where you all come in!
With the $30k we raise from this campaign, we will be able to make this movie totally epic! We promise you that every dollar you donate will end up on-screen, and the more we surpass our $30k goal, the better the overall film will be.  

 


To thank you for helping us make this crazy film for you to enjoy, we're going to give you some really cool perks in return, such as:

Digital download of the film
An autographed Blu-ray or DVD of the film
Exclusive shirts and zip-up hoodies

<p style=""text-align: center;"">Shopping Spree is a dark comedy about a killer on the loose in the supermarket ‘Ez Mart’. The 7 survivors are rushed into the manager’s office where they realize the killer is amongst them. The story follows a ‘whodunit’ type of play, where each character is equally a suspect, taking turns to blame one another for the killings.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><u><strong>WHY WE NEED YOUR HELP</strong></u></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">As struggling students, money is very scarce, a notable sum has already been funded from our own pockets. Sadly, the amount does not cover all of the expenses, making it hard for us to realize our film. The challenges we are faced with are, feeding a large crew &amp; cast department of over 30 people and counting, as well as accommodation costs for our actors. With your help and support, we can allocate the funds to these struggling areas as well as the art department which is trying its utmost to help bring the realism to its uppermost. Filming for long hours in the night into the early hours of the next day is tiring and good catering helps boost everyone’s spirits!</p>

<h3>WHO (us!), WHAT (the movie!), WHERE (the world!), WHY (we need you!), HOW (give/get!)</h3>
<p>MANSFIELD 66/67 is our fourth feature documentary -- following HIT SO HARD, ROOM 237 and DEAR MOM LOVE CHER -- and it is the biggest labor of love The Ebersole Hughes Company (i.e. US! <a href=""http://www.ebersolehughes.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.ebersolehughes.com</a>) has ever made. </p>
<p>The logline, so you know what we've done: MANSFIELD 66/67 (i.e. THE MOVIE! <a href=""http://www.mansfield6667.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.mansfield6667.com</a> ) is about the last two years of movie goddess Jayne Mansfield’s life, and the rumours swirling around her untimely death being caused by a curse, after her alleged romantic dalliance with Anton LaVey, head of the Church of Satan. It's ""a true story based on rumour and hearsay,"" celebrating Jayne's life on the 50th anniversary of her death.</p>
<p><a href=""https://store.trapart.net/books/133-california-infernal.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1498145966/eb0azbrx4rm1etwloruf.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></a></p>
<p>We've been obsessed with telling this story for 20 years and now...we have used all of our blood, sweat, tears and time to craft a documentary we are really proud of...</p>
<p>But don't take our word for it! Watch the trailers: <a href=""http://www.mansfield6667.com/trailer.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.mansfield6667.com/trailer.html</a></p>
<p>Our World Premiere was at The Rotterdam International Film Festival, a truly top-tier event. (<a href=""https://iffr.com/en/2017/films/mansfield-66-67"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://iffr.com/en/2017/films/mansfield-66-67</a>) We were picked up by a world class international sales agent who are actively selling it to buyers. (i.e. THE WORLD!) All very exciting but...</p>
<p>Now the challenge is two-fold: to tie up final loose ends so the film is literally sellable, and also to help the film stand out in a crowded field of amazing indie films so the world can even find it. This summer we continue our festival run, with screenings in Buenos Aires, Toronto, Provincetown, San Francisco, London, and more...</p>
<p>That's where you come in! (i.e. WE NEED YOU!)</p>
<p>But we hate to ask for something without giving back (i.e. GIVE/GET!), so we created a limited edition hot pink colored-vinyl LP of our amazing soundtrack as a perk for donating to the project.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1495214514/ewwkymlwrvug86qp7sav.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>And wait that's not all! The amazing artist Shag donated art work for our poster and is letting us offer items here too.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1495217233/ngpyqxoqle7gmh4tdyxw.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>And we are parting with a few of our beloved Jayne and Anton items that we have collected over the years. Some pictured here, and of course there are more items not pictured...</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>What we are up against, after putting literally everything we've got into making the movie, are the final unavoidable costs that bring the film to market where companies around the world can hopefully see it, love it, and pick it up for distribution. </p>
<p>We've set our goal at $15,000 and honestly that barely covers all the myriad of things (OMG international shipping is murderous!) that keep adding up to just get the film OUT THERE! In brief, your donations will help us cover:</p>
<p>• our LEGAL costs (""fair use"" docs like ours need lawyers to approve every single shot, every single photo)</p>
<p>• our MUSIC (mostly original but a couple songs need to be paid for to be able to have them stay in the film)</p>
<p>• last remaining LICENSING costs (with nearly 1000 images in the movie not everything falls under Fair Use)</p>
<p>• E&amp;O INSURANCE (gotta have it to even sell the film)</p>
<p>• final PRINTS (a thousand a pop and you need two in Europe and two in the US at minimum)</p>
<p>• our FESTIVAL PR (including a publicist, trailers, posters, postcards, and on and on)</p>
<p>• DELIVERY costs, which means the money we have to lay out of pocket to ""deliver"" the film when each new company is buying it and requiring that we meet their specs</p>
<p>At this point, supporting the project equals immediate gratification because it literally means helping us to bring it to audiences, sooner, bigger, better, and more-wide spread. Unlike a lot of crowdfunding campaigns, we don't need to get this film in the can...we need to get it out of the computer!!</p>
<p>So, give a little (everything is appreciated), give a lot, or, you know, just give us some love...we need all of that we can get!</p>

But don't take our word for it! Watch the trailers: http://www.mansfield6667.com/trailer.html
Our World Premiere was at The Rotterdam International Film Festival, a truly top-tier event. (https://iffr.com/en/2017/films/mansfield-66-67) We were picked up by a world class international sales agent who are actively selling it to buyers. (i.e. THE WORLD!) All very exciting but...
Now the challenge is two-fold: to tie up final loose ends so the film is literally sellable, and also to help the film stand out in a crowded field of amazing indie films so the world can even find it. This summer we continue our festival run, with screenings in Buenos Aires, Toronto, Provincetown, San Francisco, London, and more...
That's where you come in! (i.e. WE NEED YOU!)
But we hate to ask for something without giving back (i.e. GIVE/GET!), so we created a limited edition hot pink colored-vinyl LP of our amazing soundtrack as a perk for donating to the project.

And wait that's not all! The amazing artist Shag donated art work for our poster and is letting us offer items here too.

And we are parting with a few of our beloved Jayne and Anton items that we have collected over the years. Some pictured here, and of course there are more items not pictured...



What We Need & What You Get
What we are up against, after putting literally everything we've got into making the movie, are the final unavoidable costs that bring the film to market where companies around the world can hopefully see it, love it, and pick it up for distribution. 
We've set our goal at $15,000 and honestly that barely covers all the myriad of things (OMG international shipping is murderous!) that keep adding up to just get the film OUT THERE! In brief, your donations will help us cover:
• our LEGAL costs (""fair use"" docs like ours need lawyers to approve every single shot, every single photo)
• our MUSIC (mostly original but a couple songs need to be paid for to be able to have them stay in the film)
• last remaining LICENSING costs (with nearly 1000 images in the movie not everything falls under Fair Use)
• E&O INSURANCE (gotta have it to even sell the film)
• final PRINTS (a thousand a pop and you need two in Europe and two in the US at minimum)
• our FESTIVAL PR (including a publicist, trailers, posters, postcards, and on and on)
• DELIVERY costs, which means the money we have to lay out of pocket to ""deliver"" the film when each new company is buying it and requiring that we meet their specs
At this point, supporting the project equals immediate gratification because it literally means helping us to bring it to audiences, sooner, bigger, better, and more-wide spread. Unlike a lot of crowdfunding campaigns, we don't need to get this film in the can...we need to get it out of the computer!!
So, give a little (everything is appreciated), give a lot, or, you know, just give us some love...we need all of that we can get!

Other Ways You Can Help

Some people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean you can't help:Get the word out! Make some noise about our campaign! Any link to your world of contacts is appreciated more than you can possibly know.
Don't have a record player? No wall space? Don't like collectibles, t-shirts or Playboy Magazines? Give a gift to a friend! Or if you don't want any stuff, you can just hit the BACK IT button at the top of this page and do just that...

<h3><strong>Short Summary</strong></h3>
<p>I'm Zephyr Khambatta and I make music for a living.</p>
<p>I have spent the last three years working with countless amateur, semi-professional, and professional musicians, learning about what it takes to produce original music commercially. Before that, I did a 4 year long music degree.</p>
<p>I want to make as much music as I can in my lifetime that talks about life and helps people with their own lives, be it for a moment of dancing happiness, a week of mourning a lost one, or joy/sympathy forever on their travel playlists in their collections.</p>
<p>Donating to my music video(s) will help to crystallise the message I send with each song, and more importantly, reach the under-privileged, or not very well educated people in both developing and under developed countries as a YouTube link can be quite easily pulled up by anyone. Services and apps like Spotify, iTunes etc? Not so much. Even my own maid is a YouTube pro!!! :)  My aim is to reach everyone, regardless of their social standing or income or knowledge of electronics, and after a large amount of research I think YouTube would be the way (for now at least, till the next big video platform comes along).</p>
<h3><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></h3>
<p>I have saved up (and am still saving) almost every dollar I earn except for meals and travel, and still don't have enough to make a great video by a great team I have picked in LA, USA.</p>
<p>Every dollar helps, but if you donate upwards of 250, I'll put your name or your company name at the start of the video (we can discuss that)!</p>
<p>If the dollar amount is not reached, I will continue to add to it with my own savings of course, as I get more jobs in acting, advertisements, and of course MUSIC! I will not be compromising the quality of the video so the video will get made, only once the amount is reached.</p>
<h3><strong>The Impact</strong></h3>
<p>I truly believe that music can and will make the world a better place and has already been doing so. Not to mention dance, and all the other performing and visual arts. Congratulations and thank you to everyone who uses arts to impact the world in a positive way!</p>
<p>My portfolio is available upon request, to let you know of my pursuits in the music world.</p>
<p>In the pipeline is a vision for an inspirational entity, which will help people in various ways across the globe. What will accelerate that, is my music getting known. And for that, we arrive back at the same place. Videos.</p>
<h3><strong>Risks &amp; Challenges</strong></h3>
<p>The income in this industry is not guaranteed. You might be shocked to hear what some musicians make in a month.</p>
<p>My plan to turn this around, at least in Singapore, involves setting up a brilliantly run record label, in due course, Reunion X Records.</p>
<h3><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></h3>
<p>If you really cannot afford a single dollar at this point, that's fine, I understand and I would ask you to help by just sharing the campaign! That would help a lot. Alternatively, you could just share my music. Add it to your Spotify, Tidal and other streaming services' playlists and paste the YouTube links around, after you watch videos.</p>
<p>If 2000 people donate just one dollar each, we'll be there in no time. A dollar isn't a lot. Really.</p>
<p>And that's all there is to it :) <br/><br/>Thanks for reading!</p>

<h3>Clouded Sight Pictures</h3>
<p>Clouded Sight Pictures Ltd was set up two years ago by David Christopher-Turner and Alex De Luca in order to make the films that excite them, and a documentary called ""Independent Dreams"" has been made about their journey so far, which gets its release early in 2017. Since founding the company Clouded Sight Pictures it has gone from strength to strength, and are now in a position to rock and roll. So, with all due haste they have assembled a crack film crew of industry professionals, with a single goal, make a ‘Science Fiction’ film that will go toe to toe with the big boys.</p>
<p>‘Following the TruFors’ is a film that follows several people, as they each grapple with the result of their alien encounters. To which they form the group known as ""The TruFors"". They are the same as anyone else, but there is a difference in them that no one can quite put their finger on. Now, exactly one year later, they are being drawn back to the exact same place they had their first encounter.</p>
<p>We are looking for funding in order to pay our crew, and actors (at the very least we want to cover their expenses), not to mention locations, and the myriad of other costs that rear their head during any production. With that in mind, we have got some absolutely brilliant perks available. It will be used to bring the truth to the public, the truth that has been kept from us all!! Why do aliens have hairbrushes? What the hell is that green goo? And of course to fund the directors Winnebago, and the 1st AD's unhealthy obsession with ‘Jammie Dodgers’ (standard).</p>

Each member of the crew on board is as important as the next without them this film couldn't happen. The same can be said about you! So... Why do we need $$$$Simply put making films isn't cheap. We need your help to make this film happen. The money raised will go to paying our extrodinarily talented actors for their time and to our stunt coordinator for making sure our actor's are safe whilst they're strung upside down! Part of the funds will also go on our locations and gear.There'll be rewards for your donations! A digital copy of the film upon it's completion (so you don't have to wait whilst it's doing it's rounds at festivals before you get to watch it!), posters and if you donate enough we'll even bring you onto set and string you upside down to film your own death scene! (If you're into that sort of thing)As with any film there are hurdles to over come during the production process. Right now we have our crew but we're lacking in the locations! Health and safety wise we want our actors to be safe on set, especially when upside down. So, we need a stunt coordinator. All these things cost money.That's where you come in.You can make this film happen with just a small donation or if you can't afford to donate (I know that feel) simply share this around with your friends, family and other film fanatics!Let's make a film to remember x",6.0,0,"3 Campaigns

<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<p>With more than 22 years of combined experience in the entertainment industry, the directors and producers of this project bring a unique eye and vision to an old favorite.  We are passionate about film and aim to produce nothing less than Hollywood, theater quality level projects.  Our passion are horror, suspense, and psychological thrillers.  Because we love the genres so much, we won’t stop until we can produce projects that are mistaken for high-budget, Hollywood films.</p>
<p>We can achieve our objective with your help, through your contributions.  It all starts with our cast (talent).  The range in the talent of our cast is what will make this project a success.  The crew is a close-close second.  Without an experienced director of photography, director, and editor, we don’t have a project of which you are proud to say you supported.</p>
<p>You get what you pay for, right?  Help us achieve our objective by helping us pay for the level of talent you deserve to see in this short.  Help us honor the genre and produce a Hollywood quality short that will make the hairs on your arms stand on end.</p>
<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<p>We are asking for only enough funding to pay our cast and to feed the cast and crew for our 3-day shoot.  We are investing in quality incentives to match the value of your contribution level.  We want to be certain you know how grateful we are for your support.  Check out our perks for your gift options.</p>
<p>In the unlikely event we do not meet our goal, 100% of the funds will go to pay our cast, no matter how small the paycheck.  We want them to know how much we appreciate them and their talent, and we want you to know how much we appreciate your support.  None of the crew will take any pay on this project, UNLESS we exceed our goal.  None of the “above line” crew will take pay UNTIL the entire cast &amp; crew are paid!</p>
<p><strong>Challenges</strong></p>
<p>Our greatest challenge in getting this short produced is bringing on highly talented cast members.  We are fortunate to know some very talented actors who want to come on board.  They might be willing to do this one short for us for no pay but we want to keep them on board for future projects.  The only way we can guarantee they will continue to work with us is to pay them for their service.</p>
<p>Everyone, in any industry, expects to be paid for a service they provide.  Actors and crew in the film industry are no exception to that expectation.  The adage “you get what you pay for” is nearly always true.  Some are willing to work for free or deferred pay for a project about which they are passionate and to help friends start a new company.  Asking anyone to work for free or deferred more than once is taking advantage and that is NOT how we want to be known.</p>
<p>While we have asked the talent and crew for this project to donate their time, we very much want to surprise them with a paycheck to thank them for their time and willingness to help us.  YOU can help us do that with your contribution.</p>
<p><strong>More Ways You Can Help</strong></p>
<p>We are low/no budget filmmakers…for the time being…so we certainly empathize with lack of funds.  You can still help!  Help us make some noise and direct traffic to our campaign.  Click or tap a share tool above and ask your followers to contribute and/or share, too.  The more people we can reach the better our odds of getting funded!</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>The film is about an escaped convict named Mason Parks who stumbles upon a small town, nestled in the wilderness of Idaho called Pinewood. Everyone in the town seems to be in a gleeful trance until Mason encounters Katie whose father was just brutally murdered by mysterious hillbillies in a beat up truck. The two of them team up to escape the killer mountain town, but encounter paranormal hurdles along the way.</p>
<p>Pinewood is a collaboration of Idaho filmmakers, created by Clear as Mudd Films in association with Northwest Motion Pictures and Tetro Productions. The film is shot entirely in the state of Idaho in support of local businesses and communities.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>The Origins of Pinewood</h2>
<h3><i>Words from the Writer &amp; Director, Matt Mudd</i></h3>
<p><i>All of my screenplays come from my experiences. ""Pinewood."" Is  derived from a particularly important experience in my life. In 1994, my family went through a major tragedy...we lost my little sister. We were in McCall doing some volunteer work for the Girl Scout Camp. I was there when the accident happened. I was just 6 years old and the trauma has followed me into my adult life. I have developed PTSD from the event, which primarily manifests itself in very vivid nightmares. One such nightmare was the inspiration for this story. I was in McCall (though it was called something else in the dream)...and I was looking for my sister and younger brother. But, my efforts were futile. Upon trying to leave I realized that I couldn't get out. I was trapped, and isolated...which became the story's main themes. I thought a lot about it afterwards and realized that in that nightmare I felt like I was in my own version of hell and couldn't leave. Without giving too much away, much of what the main character, Mason experiences happened to me in that dream. And the major underlying story to ""Pinewood,"" being trapped in a personal hell, surrounded by the demons of your past with no way out. Samantha has always been an inspiration in my writing but, this film has situations, characters and feelings associated with what I have dealt with since the tragedy. Writing this has been an extremely positive way to deal with the aftermath of this tragedy, which is why getting this film made right and sharing it with the world is so important to me. -Matt Mudd</i></p>

The film is about an escaped convict named Mason Parks who stumbles upon a small town, nestled in the wilderness of Idaho called Pinewood. Everyone in the town seems to be in a gleeful trance until Mason encounters Katie whose father was just brutally murdered by mysterious hillbillies in a beat up truck. The two of them team up to escape the killer mountain town, but encounter paranormal hurdles along the way.
Pinewood is a collaboration of Idaho filmmakers, created by Clear as Mudd Films in association with Northwest Motion Pictures and Tetro Productions. The film is shot entirely in the state of Idaho in support of local businesses and communities.
 
The Origins of Pinewood
Words from the Writer & Director, Matt Mudd
All of my screenplays come from my experiences. ""Pinewood."" Is  derived from a particularly important experience in my life. In 1994, my family went through a major tragedy...we lost my little sister. We were in McCall doing some volunteer work for the Girl Scout Camp. I was there when the accident happened. I was just 6 years old and the trauma has followed me into my adult life. I have developed PTSD from the event, which primarily manifests itself in very vivid nightmares. One such nightmare was the inspiration for this story. I was in McCall (though it was called something else in the dream)...and I was looking for my sister and younger brother. But, my efforts were futile. Upon trying to leave I realized that I couldn't get out. I was trapped, and isolated...which became the story's main themes. I thought a lot about it afterwards and realized that in that nightmare I felt like I was in my own version of hell and couldn't leave. Without giving too much away, much of what the main character, Mason experiences happened to me in that dream. And the major underlying story to ""Pinewood,"" being trapped in a personal hell, surrounded by the demons of your past with no way out. Samantha has always been an inspiration in my writing but, this film has situations, characters and feelings associated with what I have dealt with since the tragedy. Writing this has been an extremely positive way to deal with the aftermath of this tragedy, which is why getting this film made right and sharing it with the world is so important to me. -Matt Mudd

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>‘Anew’ is an indie dramatic short film, produced by Nightingale Films, a production company, founded by Shrey Bhargava, an actor and filmmaker from Singapore and a student at the University of Southern California's School of Dramatic Arts . The team behind ‘Anew’ is largely comprised of students attending USC’s School of Cinematic Arts.</p>
<p>The story behind ‘Anew’ is close to our hearts and was inspired by our own experiences of love. This film brought together people of different races and backgrounds who have experienced these same conflicts as the characters we too often see on screen. This film brought together a racially and culturally diverse team from distinct backgrounds, including the US, Singapore and Indonesia. Through this story, we hope to reveal how the human experience of love is universal, and transcends racial and cultural boundaries.</p>
<p>'Anew' follows a young man in his search for love while he struggles to let go of his previous relationship. His battle with coming to terms with his personal journey compels him to realize some difficult lessons about love.</p>
<p>With your support, we’ll be able to complete post production on this film - including music composition and sound design - and you’ll directly help us send it to festivals because most of them require significant entry fees.</p>
<p>The more help we get from you, the further this film will go.</p>

<h3> </h3>
<p>If we reach our goal for ‘Anew’, we will be able to bring our ultimate vision for this film to life. To complement the pensive and contemplative story, we want to use live musicians to record the film’s score. The portion of our budget dedicated to music composition would go towards paying a composer,  instrumentalists, and an audio engineer. We also hope to hire an experienced sound designer who would be able to make the film sound as flawless as possible.</p>
<p>Among the film festivals we plan to submit this film to, are, most notably, The Asian American International Film Festival, The San Francisco International Asian American Film Festival and The Los Angeles Shorts International Film Festival.</p>
<p>Be assured, that even if we do not reach our goal, we will use whatever funding we do receive to complete the film and send it to as many film festivals as possible.</p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Nightingale Films’ most recent work, a silent short film, ‘One Day’, featuring Bernard Dinata’s single ‘If I Don’t Remember’ can be found on <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48FWZAZc8S8"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48FWZAZc8S8</a>. It was made on a similar budget and Nightingale Films hopes to do an even better job with ‘Anew’.</p>
<p>Recently, our producer, Shrey, was placed in the spotlight in Singapore for drawing attention to the practices of casual racism and the stereotypical representation of minorities in Singaporean media. In response to his post, while many did support him and his message, many others were quick to denounce him, resorting to personal attacks and racial hate. Such a response has revealed a side of humanity that we may have thought was gone, but continues to exist just beneath the surface.</p>
<p>‘Anew’ is Shrey’s first attempt after the saga to tell stories that transcend these racial and cultural boundaries. ‘Anew’ explores the theme of love, a concept blind to color and background, a concept that binds us all as humans. With this film, we first hope to tell a real story that resonates with all. And second, we hope to show that this story can be told with actors irrespective of their color or background.</p>
<p>Your contribution will make this film a reality. It has already been filmed, and just needs your help for the final push in post production. After completing this film, any remaining contributions would go far in submitting this film to notable film festivals in the hopes of spreading this work and message out into the world.</p>
<p>You can help us make the statement that the only response to hate ought to be love, that our diversity ought to be represented on film as truly as possible in order to lift our social consciousness to realize that, despite our differences, we are all one, we are all human and we all go through the same human experiences. In the end, while this journey of love might be difficult, we ought to always pursue it with an open heart, even if we have to start anew.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Since this project is in post production, we can guarantee that the film will be made. Your contributions will ensure that the post production process can reach its full potential and that the film can be submitted to festivals worldwide. You determine how far we can go and how far we can push this message.</p>

After completing this film, any remaining contributions would go far in submitting this film to notable film festivals in the hopes of spreading this work and message out into the world.
You can help us make the statement that the only response to hate ought to be love, that our diversity ought to be represented on film as truly as possible in order to lift our social consciousness to realize that, despite our differences, we are all one, we are all human and we all go through the same human experiences. In the end, while this journey of love might be difficult, we ought to always pursue it with an open heart, even if we have to start anew.

Risks & Challenges
Since this project is in post production, we can guarantee that the film will be made. Your contributions will ensure that the post production process can reach its full potential and that the film can be submitted to festivals worldwide. You determine how far we can go and how far we can push this message.

<p>I think sometimes I forget this simple truth as I live out my walk as a believer in Jesus Christ. It doesn’t start with me, my plans or even my desires. I have found myself many times call out to God as Lord, but my actions were not matching my words.</p>
<p>One way I found myself declaring God as Lord and not following in my actions was surrounding evangelism. I had drawn a line in the “spiritual sand” and told God that this is not an area that I feel comfortable in…so don’t ask me to cross it. I had set the limits of my dedication and service to and for God.</p>
<p>But in God’s graciousness He has revealed to me that by drawing a line in the sand, I was in essence telling Him that I didn’t love His work of salvation. I was telling God that I was not interesting in His desires of reconciling the world to Himself.</p>
<p>Over time I have experienced a heart change related to my desire in sharing the Good News. Somewhere along the way, the line I drew had disappeared. Instead of standing opposed to His plans, I love what He loves. I desire what He desires, and that includes bringing people to salvation.</p>
<p>Now I have to be honest. The heart change did not come with instant success at presenting the Good News and seeing salvations. As a matter of fact I am terrible at this type of Kingdom work, but I know I have the right heart. And God uses people with the right heart. And from this heart change came the vision for uniting Jesus’ global church for the sole purpose of bringing the lost to salvation.</p>

</div></div>","It all starts with God, right?
I think sometimes I forget this simple truth as I live out my walk as a believer in Jesus Christ. It doesn’t start with me, my plans or even my desires. I have found myself many times call out to God as Lord, but my actions were not matching my words.
One way I found myself declaring God as Lord and not following in my actions was surrounding evangelism. I had drawn a line in the “spiritual sand” and told God that this is not an area that I feel comfortable in…so don’t ask me to cross it. I had set the limits of my dedication and service to and for God.
But in God’s graciousness He has revealed to me that by drawing a line in the sand, I was in essence telling Him that I didn’t love His work of salvation. I was telling God that I was not interesting in His desires of reconciling the world to Himself.
Over time I have experienced a heart change related to my desire in sharing the Good News. Somewhere along the way, the line I drew had disappeared. Instead of standing opposed to His plans, I love what He loves. I desire what He desires, and that includes bringing people to salvation.
Now I have to be honest. The heart change did not come with instant success at presenting the Good News and seeing salvations. As a matter of fact I am terrible at this type of Kingdom work, but I know I have the right heart. And God uses people with the right heart. And from this heart change came the vision for uniting Jesus’ global church for the sole purpose of bringing the lost to salvation.

<div>
<p><b>Delilah (FEMALE - 15) LEAD</b></p>
<p>Being in a new town is hard enough, but what comes before is even harder. Delilah struggles with saying goodbye to her best friend Brenda as well as her deceased mother she visits often. Along with the move, Delilah and her sister battle against the factors of their mothers death. Delilah sees the world much different than other 16 year old girls her age and has a pretty cool way of interpreting it as well. Delilah has a strong opinion and chooses to see the world for what it is, while others turn a shy eye to what it’s not. </p>
<p><b>Nancy (FEMALE - 17) LEAD</b></p>
<p>With a dark past of self harm and other demons, Nancy is mad at the world unlike Delilah her sister. Nancy has an enforced rough front to block out the pain that lies behind her eyes. She is  also a little gothic and trusts no one. Nancy takes her mothers death and pushes blame onto Delilah. This causes their relationship to be iffy and confusing at times. Overall Nancy has a good heart, but a heart that needs a little help.</p>
<p><b>Brenda (FEMALE - 15) SUPPORTING LEAD</b></p>
<p>Brenda is used to change since her mother and father have been divorced since she was little. Brenda loves to help people and make them feel good about themselves. She is also an extremely artsy young lady that paints to reduce stress. Brenda, much like Delilah, sees the world through a different lens then most people. This causes Brenda and Delilah to be best friends. Brenda chooses to take the world by storm and not let anything affect deeply affect her.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><b>Stanley (MALE - 14) SUPPORTING LEAD</b></p>
<p>Dumped and Unwanted is how Stanley sees himself after his parents abandoned him. Stanley has a stutter and twitching issue since his gunshot accident when he was little. After meeting Delilah his world suddenly changes and he comes to terms with himself and the outside world. Stanley is not one to hold back a question and has a very little filter (Even though it is not his fault). The world has been cruel to Stanley, but he chooses to appreciate what he has.</p>

<br/>The World's Leading Voice for Gay Dads (Is Going Mobile!)<br/>
</h3>
<p><a href=""http://gaywithkids.com?utm_source=indiegogo&amp;utm_medium=project-text&amp;utm_campaign=gay-dads-social-network"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Gays With Kids</a>® is the first and only global resource for gay dads and gay men considering fatherhood<b>. Our mission is to make sure every gay dad feels welcome, represented and connected regardless of his path to fatherhood or where he lives. </b>Please donate now to help us build an app that will connect gay dads.</p>
<p>Co-founders Brian and Ferd (husbands and fathers of three young children) launched Gays With Kids® last year. It’s a full-time effort, and until now we've covered the cost for everything as a labor of love: a website with hundreds of feature articles, gay dad blog posts, videos, and the world’s largest online collection of gay dad family photos; engaged and growing communities on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter; and a robust YouTube channel with total viewership surpassing one million!</p>
<p><b>We're raising money to transition from a labor of love into a sustainable, long-term business. The first thing we'll do is build our app so gay dads can connect locally and around the world.</b></p>
<p>Since our launch we’ve reached <i>hundreds of thousands</i> of gay dads from across the globe. We’re <i>overwhelmed</i> by the outpouring of love and support that we receive each week. Many of these messages bring us close to tears.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>

<p>In your feedback, you've made it clear that there's more we can do: You want help connecting with other gay dads. <b>That's why we're going to build you the world’s first app and website designed exclusively for gay dads. </b><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Whether you’re already part of our community, or this is your first interaction with us and you like what you see, please show your appreciation and support by contributing now — even if it's just one dollar.</span></p>

<h3>Can $1 Really Help?</h3>
<p></p>
<p><b>YES! </b>As we embark on this new adventure, <b>we need to know that you’re out there, </b>and your gift of even just one dollar means you’ll stand out and be counted. Beyond helping us show the strength of our community, <b>if every Gays With Kids® follower donated even a dollar, we can start building this next phase of Gays With Kids® <i>tomorrow</i>.</b></p>
<h3>Our Big (Gay Dad!) Vision</h3>
<div>
<h3></h3>
<p>We've dreamed up an incredibly awesome website and an accompanying mobile app with more of what you love plus guest blogging, private networking, and other social features. Once built, our app will enable you to:</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>         • Connect with gay dads in your local community<br/>         • Arrange play dates with other gay dad families<br/>         • Find single gay dads to date<br/>         • Seek advice from mentors for help in your own journey to fatherhood<br/>         • Get support from an empathic gay dad who’s already ‘been there, done that’</p>

<h3>Here's How Your Contributions Will Be Applied</h3>
<div>In the Fall of this year, we met with several software development teams to talk about our plans for the future. We hired the smartest and most innovative of these firms for a two-week project that would enable them to provide us with the blueprints for a prototype of Gays With Kids® 2.0. This prototype includes all the features members of our community have asked for. The bid we were quoted to build it is $200,000.</div>
<div>
<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1446438005/iecq92isb0fs2x4dk9m5.png"" src="""" style=""""/><br/>
</div>
<p><b>If we raise less than $100,000: </b>Each month we incur many expenses to maintain our website and social media, including the cost to create and edit written and video content, as well as pay for web hosting, freelancers and business consultants. If we raise up to $50,000 from this campaign, we will use the money to fund the continuation of the site while we pursue other funding opportunities to build the app and new website. The more backers we can show as interested, the easier it will be to find other funding.</p>
<p><b>If we raise $100,000 or more: </b>We will commence work on the mobile app and re-designed website. The first step we’ll take will be to hire an experienced and talented project manager. He or she will then source a software development firm while we pursue other funding opportunities to raise the remaining budget.</p>
<p><b>If we raise the full $200,000: </b>The funding will be allocated for the payment for a contract project manager, the actual cost of construction for Gays With Kids® 2.0, beginning immediately. Here's the timeline after $200,000 is raised:</p>

<div><h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3></div>
<div>
<p><b>What are the risks and challenges involved? </b>Brian is an experienced entrepreneur and successful sales and marketing executive. More importantly, we (Brian and Ferd) are both gay and we are proud and loving husbands and dads. We created our family of five through adoption and surrogacy. We launched Gays With Kids® in June of 2014 because we are passionate about showing our families in a positive and accurate light and about building a safe and welcoming community in which gay dads can connect. All of this has been completely self-funded until now, and to great success. The funding we receive from this campaign will enable us to do more and better serve our fast-growing global community.</p>
<p><b>How can I get more involved helping to promote your campaign? </b>We VERY much welcome your support! Please contact <a href=""mailto:brian@gayswithkids.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">brian@gayswithkids.com</a> to talk about how you can help us out further.</p>

<p><b>Are you looking for writers?</b> Absolutely! We have the world’s largest community of gay dads blogging about their experiences creating and raising families and we welcome more! We also have freelance writing opportunities for talented writers interested in profiling gay dad families or writing on topics of interest to gay dad families.

<p><b>Do you have other opportunities for me to get involved?</b> We’re very interested in working with volunteers and freelancers and we offer flexible hours that should be especially interesting to stay-at-home dads.

Please contact <a href=""mailto:brian@gayswithkids.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">brian@gayswithkids.com</a></p>
<p><b>Are you a non-profit?</b> To date, Gays With Kids® has been a complete labor of love and we have funded everything out of our own pockets. We recently incorporated as a for-profit business entity as we plan to incorporate revenue streams when we launch Gays With Kids® 2.0. Our hope is that we will become self-sustaining in order to provide ongoing value to gay dads and dads-to-be for many, many years.</p>
<p><b>What is the Gays With Kids® reader profile?</b> Visitors to our website, our Facebook page, YouTube channel, Instagram page and Twitter channel come from all over the world and represent gay dads, gay men who have already started their journeys to fatherhood, others from the LGBT community, and family members, friends, neighbors and colleagues who support us.  </p>
<b>How are you going to develop the social network platform and apps? </b>Agile methodology is a software development project management style that provides opportunities to assess the direction of a project throughout the development lifecycle. We like it because when a team stops and re-evaluates the direction of a project every two weeks, there’s always time to steer it in another direction. </div>
<div>We want to hire a software development firm that uses this methodology to build Gays With Kids® 2.0 because the results of this “inspect-and-adapt” approach to development greatly reduce both development costs and time to market. Because teams can develop software at the same time they’re gathering requirements, the phenomenon known as “analysis paralysis” is less likely to impede a team from making progress. And because a team’s work cycle is limited to two weeks, it gives stakeholders recurring opportunities to calibrate releases for success in the real world. <br/><br/><div>

The World's Leading Voice for Gay Dads (Is Going Mobile!)

Gays With Kids® is the first and only global resource for gay dads and gay men considering fatherhood. Our mission is to make sure every gay dad feels welcome, represented and connected regardless of his path to fatherhood or where he lives. Please donate now to help us build an app that will connect gay dads.
Co-founders Brian and Ferd (husbands and fathers of three young children) launched Gays With Kids® last year. It’s a full-time effort, and until now we've covered the cost for everything as a labor of love: a website with hundreds of feature articles, gay dad blog posts, videos, and the world’s largest online collection of gay dad family photos; engaged and growing communities on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter; and a robust YouTube channel with total viewership surpassing one million!
We're raising money to transition from a labor of love into a sustainable, long-term business. The first thing we'll do is build our app so gay dads can connect locally and around the world.
Since our launch we’ve reached hundreds of thousands of gay dads from across the globe. We’re overwhelmed by the outpouring of love and support that we receive each week. Many of these messages bring us close to tears.






In your feedback, you've made it clear that there's more we can do: You want help connecting with other gay dads. That's why we're going to build you the world’s first app and website designed exclusively for gay dads. Whether you’re already part of our community, or this is your first interaction with us and you like what you see, please show your appreciation and support by contributing now — even if it's just one dollar.

Can $1 Really Help?

YES! As we embark on this new adventure, we need to know that you’re out there, and your gift of even just one dollar means you’ll stand out and be counted. Beyond helping us show the strength of our community, if every Gays With Kids® follower donated even a dollar, we can start building this next phase of Gays With Kids® tomorrow.
Our Big (Gay Dad!) Vision


We've dreamed up an incredibly awesome website and an accompanying mobile app with more of what you love plus guest blogging, private networking, and other social features. Once built, our app will enable you to:


         • Connect with gay dads in your local community         • Arrange play dates with other gay dad families         • Find single gay dads to date         • Seek advice from mentors for help in your own journey to fatherhood         • Get support from an empathic gay dad who’s already ‘been there, done that’


Watch this video for more details.





Here's How Your Contributions Will Be Applied
In the Fall of this year, we met with several software development teams to talk about our plans for the future. We hired the smartest and most innovative of these firms for a two-week project that would enable them to provide us with the blueprints for a prototype of Gays With Kids® 2.0. This prototype includes all the features members of our community have asked for. The bid we were quoted to build it is $200,000.



If we raise less than $100,000: Each month we incur many expenses to maintain our website and social media, including the cost to create and edit written and video content, as well as pay for web hosting, freelancers and business consultants. If we raise up to $50,000 from this campaign, we will use the money to fund the continuation of the site while we pursue other funding opportunities to build the app and new website. The more backers we can show as interested, the easier it will be to find other funding.
If we raise $100,000 or more: We will commence work on the mobile app and re-designed website. The first step we’ll take will be to hire an experienced and talented project manager. He or she will then source a software development firm while we pursue other funding opportunities to raise the remaining budget.
If we raise the full $200,000: The funding will be allocated for the payment for a contract project manager, the actual cost of construction for Gays With Kids® 2.0, beginning immediately. Here's the timeline after $200,000 is raised:





What's In It For You

Check out the perks at right! When you make a contribution, you could receive Gays With Kids® stickers, a photo album for your own family memories, an early invite to our mobile app and social network or inclusion in our advisory board as we develop Gays With Kids® 2.0, and a special badge on your future social profile, so everyone you meet on the future Gays With Kids® social network will know it exists because of YOUR help.

One of the most renowned film schools in Turkey. I'm graduating this year and I've created a project I'm very passionate about. Which is at the shooting stage with a lot of the pre-production phase complete.</p>
<p>The concept of the film revolves around a world where all celestial objects in the space have a control room/cockpit. Within this control room is the heart, an electronic orb that powers the planet. Finally, a technician to maintain everything.</p>
<p>In the story, the heart of the sun malfunctions due to a little mistake by our main character, the technician. The sun starts heating up. He then tries to prevent the planets in our solar system, including Earth from getting scorched. Even though he manages to save one little planet by the name of Pluto, his failure causes him to doubt his own purpose in life.</p>
<p>This film is about humanity's endless appetite towards getting nature under control and shaping it as we want.</p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>We need your contribution to make this film happen. A lot of the pre-production stage has been finished. Script, storyboard, concept design, color palette, the location, equipment...</p>

Short Summary I am a student from Bahçeşehir University in Istanbul. One of the most renowned film schools in Turkey. I'm graduating this year and I've created a project I'm very passionate about. Which is at the shooting stage with a lot of the pre-production phase complete.
The concept of the film revolves around a world where all celestial objects in the space have a control room/cockpit. Within this control room is the heart, an electronic orb that powers the planet. Finally, a technician to maintain everything.
In the story, the heart of the sun malfunctions due to a little mistake by our main character, the technician. The sun starts heating up. He then tries to prevent the planets in our solar system, including Earth from getting scorched. Even though he manages to save one little planet by the name of Pluto, his failure causes him to doubt his own purpose in life.
This film is about humanity's endless appetite towards getting nature under control and shaping it as we want.   What We Need & What You Get We need your contribution to make this film happen. A lot of the pre-production stage has been finished. Script, storyboard, concept design, color palette, the location, equipment...
We have sponsorships for the location and equipment from the awesome people who work in the film industry and were willing to help out.
Here's where the money will be going for our two-day shoot:
- Props: $200- Make-up: $100- Food: $50- Gas: $50- Post-Production: $100
We have a very limited deadline. That's why this campaign is only 7 days long. We are shooting between 23rd and 24th of January.
    
The Team
I have a set of very trust-worthy people working with me. I've worked with them on past projects throughout many years. Now we're coming together for what I believe will be the best project we will have done so far.

    Risks & Challenges We have worked with digital effects and sets before in our previous projects. Even though this is the biggest digital set we will be constructing.

We've shot that previous project, Misclick, in a very basic green screen we constructed ourselves with a near-zero-budget production:




We only had three working lights, we couldn't light the greenscreen very well etc. But this time, we will be shooting on a professional green screen studio (image is from one of their clients' shoots):


This way we will get rid of the keying problems we previously had and work in an environment where we can more effectively find solutions to problems with the opportunities available to us.

Rousey... Liddell... McGregor...  We will bring you content on the fighters who are aren't the millionaires or in the spotlight...yet.  They're not getting the big headlines.  They're family men, business owners, hard workers, all dreaming of that one shot to make it.  These are their stories in and out of the octagon... This is MMA Stories

There are many projects to support …Why us?


Our Purpose for doing this documentary is to show you that you are not so far from reaching your fullest potential… it may be closer than you think.  MMA Fighters Aung La Nsang and Jon Delbrugge continue their journey in Mixed Martial Arts.  Jon prepares for his call to the UFC, and Aung La continues down his road of success in the One FC
All funds will go towards ensuring we deliver an exciting documentary
We want to share this message with the masses







Baltimore native, Jon Delbrugge is many things.  A professional fighter, a business entrepreneur, a mentor, a husband, and recently he achieved his greatest accomplishment... he became A Father... Jon has spent most of his life training, competing, for that one call.  The call that he and many believe is coming soon... his call to the UFC.

We want to bring you content the only way we know how.  Our way.  In-depth,  uncensored, and intense.  After we bring you a year of content, we culminate with the releasing of our short film titled, Devastator: An MMA Story.Our sequel, The Burmese Python: An MMA story follows Aung La Nsang before, during, and after his epic fight in his homeland of Myanmar, Burma this March.  For the first time ever, he will compete in stadium he grew up near in front of his friends, family, and countrymen and woman.  The biggest athlete in Burma's history comes home for the fight of his life.From Burma to Michigan to Baltimore, Aung La's journey spans worldwide.  This is his MMA Story.




MMA Stories will release 15-30 second teasers on social media weekly, giving a quick inside look on each chapter that will be shown.  The chapters themselves will be between 2-5 minutes each.  Such examples are..

PUTTIN IN WORK - The training of an MMA fighter is some of the most intense in all sports.  We take the cameras into the training centers, gyms and see what it really takes... This is Puttin in Work...
FAMILY - Support systems can come from many places.  For Jon and Aung, his family has been there every step of the way.  We look at his career through their eyes...  This is Family...

GIVING BACK - Jon will return to his high school roots in Glenelg, passing along his guidance and wisdom to the current athletes...Stepping back on the same field he once dominated on...  For Aung, he lives and breathes martial arts.  As an instructor at Crazy 88 in Maryland, he passes his experiences on to a new generation of martial artists... This is Giving Back...

Production Crews (Director/Director of Photography/Sound/PA's)
Equipment (Lighting, Camera Upgrades, ect.)
Music Licensing
Travel Expenses
Editing (Other Post Production Costs/Crew)
Marketting & Promotion
Distribution





This allows us to move forward with this project and gets us one step closer to successful completion.  We will provide updates along the way.  This is a massive multimedia platform, a series of featurettes, teasers, behind the scenes looks, and finally a Short Film all documenting Jon's 2016 fight season.  We will get in depth content about his Family Life, Giving Back to the Community, Training, and  Competitions.  


The Impact

 Jon and Aung's story shows how anyone can reach their full potential.  Jon's dream is about to come true... Aung currently fights in the One FC, one of the biggest fight organizations in the world.  Perhaps their story can help others fine their potential and reach their dreams...

</li></ul>
<p style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106);"">Spontaneity, 99 hours time, a camera and I personally think that a good cast and crew will make all the difference. </p>

<p style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106);"">Alright. Honestly, it is fun. More importantly this will give us exposure and will hopefully get us more projects in the feature.  </p>

</div></div>","Hello there Film Lovers,
First of all thanks for checking out our project. 

We are a bunch of independent filmmakers who would like to take part in a 99 hours film competition from 99FIRE-FILMS-AWARD 2016. 

We have worked on various projects so far including short films, feature films, music videos and documentaries. Our films have been played in different film festivals and have also won awards. 

So what will our short film be about? 
Umm... well...that is indeed a very good question. But we don't know yet. We will find out on the day the film challenge starts. It could be anything. Which is really exciting but also a bit terrifying. However, the excitement wins.

Let me explain the 99 hours film competition to you:



What is it all about?

You conceptualize, shoot and edit a film in exactly 99 hours. Your enemy is definitely Time.


What do you need to take part?

Spontaneity, 99 hours time, a camera and I personally think that a good cast and crew will make all the difference. 


What’s essential?

Speed, creativity and flashes of genius – and most of all the joy of shooting films. And a little bit insanity.

On January 28th, 2016 we will receive an e-mail with our topic. And then we have time from 10:00am on 28th January 2016, till 1:00pm on 01st February 2016 to make a 99 seconds long film. 
99 seconds you say? Yup. I know it sounds like such little time to make a proper film but it's really not. If you check out the previous films from the years before at 99FIRE-FILMS 2016 under review, you can see they created amazing stories within this amount of time.
So why would we like to take part in this competition and what would we get out of it?
Alright. Honestly, it is fun. More importantly this will give us exposure and will hopefully get us more projects in the feature.  
Furthermore there is a money price to win which we would like to use to film a feature film that we already have in the works.
We can assure you that every single penny we will make from this campaign will end up on screen. Everyone of us offers up their time for free as we all believe we can create something nice here.
What will we need £1000 for?
We want to make a great little film and for that we will need some things.
Equipment hire is quite expensive. However, we would like to give our Director of Photography the possibility to get the equipment he wants to use. To get him the equipment though we will need to insure it. Also we want to insure our whole cast and crew to make sure that everyone is covered.
So let's break it down:



£300 will be used for equipment hire which includes lenses, lights and Gimbal.


£200 will be used for equipment insurance


£50 will be used to feed our cast and crew

£50 will be used for the Indiegogo fees

£200 will be used for locations


$200 will be used for set design, costumes, make up and hair and props


Should we not make our goal, any money will still go into this production as every penny will make it better. 
We can make the film we want to make if we could even meet half of our goal.




We also have the incredible possibility to work together with Jon Wayre from http://www.cinephonics.co.uk/ props. We can use some really cool vintage props like cameras, microphones, etc. which we would like to explore in this short film. Also Jon is amazing with set build and as a sound recordist.
Who exactly are we?
We are ArtManic Films, a small production company, which was founded by Marco Prates and Nicole Behrens back in February 2015. Ever since then we have been working on different projects like films, documentaries, music videos and promo videos.
We work together with different freelancers to create the best filming crews possible.

<div>""Mourning the death of his wife, Mr.Wang's life is turned upside down when he finds her vibrator""<br/>
</div>
<div><br/></div>
<h3>Synopsis</h3>
<div><p><b><i>Vibration</i></b> is a short comedy and touching drama about a 72 year old Chinese man who struggles with emptiness and loneliness after the death of his wife. While organizing her possessions, he happens to discover a vibrator under her bed. The problem is that he lacks an understanding about the modern sexual technology that he discovered … or maybe about her. Our intention with <i>Vibration </i>is to explore a human relationship and loneliness often caused by a lack of communication and selfishness: that we are living in an increasingly lonely world; that we live in a modern society that is often proud for the development of communication technology while at the same time losing real intimacy. Comedy is the ideal genre to explore these themes by turning our tears into irony, into laughter, and then into pathos. </p></div> </div> <div> <h3></h3>

<p><i>WHO KNEW</i>
will be the debut <b>feature film</b> for Nuh! Productions.  </p>
<p>The team, Angela Pezzano and Dulce Aguilar
have sat on this incredibly moving script for seven years; fine tuning their
craft of film making to reach the level of awesomeness required to make it into
a brilliant piece of cinema …. And at last, we are ready!</p>
</div><div>

<p></p>
<p><i>Who Knew</i> is a portrait of
adolescence about ambition, the love of drugs, the art of not eating, family
pressures and the ugly truth of social responsibilities. Set against the
backdrop of a blue collar, multicultural Greater West Sydney suburb, the story
follows an unlikely friendship between the provocative wild child and the
brainiac literally killing herself to be number one.</p>
<p>Domeninca and Lexie, our two leading ladies;
were brought to life by Angela Pezzano, a writer/actor/director who has a slate
of video and stage work under her belt. Her short film <i>Whispers</i>
(directed and co-produced by Angela; co-produced by Dulce) was screened and
awarded at several festivals in Australia, notably as a finalist of the Women
Say Something 2014 festival.  Her partner
in film making crime, Dulce Aguilar hails from a variety of specialised
backgrounds from Camera to Producing and Coordinating to Assistant Directing
and Location Management. She likes to title herself, simply, Filmmaker.  </p>

A
philosophy that holds a lot of importance to Nuh! is:<br/><p></p>

<p>Thank you George Eliot! We feel that by making
<i>this</i> film; by telling stories that
inspire change and encouraging people to think and talk about confronting
issues,  we are doing this. We invite you
to join us in doing so. </p>
<p><b><br/></b></p>
<h3><b>WHAT WE NEED &amp; WHAT YOU GET</b></h3>
<p>In an ideal world, a target budget of
$106,000 would ensure completion of the film and life would be easier.  But easy would be boring! </p>
<p>So for this campaign, our initial goal is
$31,500.  The money raised in this
campaign will assist with: </p>
<p></p>
<ul><li>
<span style='letter-spacing: 0px;font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;'>Equipment Hire; so that we can
actually record something to show you</span><br/>
</li></ul>
<p>and</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>
<span style='letter-spacing: 0px;font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;'>Art Department; an essential
part of Angela’s vision are the particular individual styles of each character
which is crucial to the film’s uniqueness</span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<i style='letter-spacing: 0px;font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;'>plus</i><span style='letter-spacing: 0px;font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;'> Covering fees associated with our
Indiegogo campaign</span><br/>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Some of our awesome perks for the campaign
include:</p>
<p>* Visiting the set</p>
<p>* Being an extra on the film</p>
<p>* Naming a minor character</p>
<p>* Exclusive T-shirts with quotes from the
film!</p>
<h3><b><br/></b></h3>
<h3><b>THE IMPACT:</b></h3>
<p>Who Knew is an awareness project in the
form of a film. </p>
<p>We aim to make
an emotional impact on our audiences to bring awareness
and open up discussions about eating disorders, drug abuse, sexuality and
family relationships. These issues are very important to us because
unfortunately, they are still rife and prevalent in today’s society.  People tend to ignore
these issues by brushing it off as “just a phase” or hoping that the signs they
see are not really there, so that they don’t have to take responsibility.  We want to show audiences that it’s okay to
ask for help, that it’s okay to ask your peers how they are doing, that its ok
if life is tough - that they don’t have to do it alone.</p>
<p>Support goes a long way, but we want to
push this further by creating open forums at our film screening nights through
Q &amp; A’s and talks with issue-related organisations. We are working towards
partnering with a charity that aligns with the film’s themes and having them at
screenings as well as having a perk that donates a portion of the funds to
them. Our hope is that this film can make a
difference to someone’s life. Even just one. </p>

<h3>RISKS &amp; CHALLENGES:</h3>
<p>There are always challenges when it comes
to film making. Bad weather, not enough money, schedule clashes, Divas…but the
risk? The risk of keeping silent about these issues….</p>
<p>The risk of staying silent could mean your
child is not telling you something they don’t know how to.</p>
<p>The risk of staying silent could mean your
best friend is slowly harming themselves in front of your very own eyes.</p>
<p>The risk of staying silent could mean you
don’t know how to get out of your uncontrollable spiral.</p>
<p>No matter what, this film needs to be made
and shown.  It is far too important to us
to let it stay on paper any longer. </p>
<p>In order to ensure filming occurs and the
film is completed, we plan to run a tight-production ship with a bare minimum
crew and calling in solid i-owe-you’s to keep costs down. We will utilise
connections to source amazing location gems in the Greater West Sydney area and
collaborate with some amazing emerging talents.  </p>
<p>We have worked on so many independent
projects with little to no funding, including our award winning short <i>Whispers,</i>
we have the experience and problem solving attitude to be able to make <i>Who

Crazy, I know.</div>So, there are all these things that need funding: costumes, props, special effects, cameras, lenses, microphones, lights, food (Actors need to eat?

Wow, who knew this web-series stuff would be so needy?   THE UGLY PRETTY. OH, SO PRETTY. Let's break it down. Here's what we got. Great idea? Superheroes in therapy. Check. Amazing and talented cast and crew with a proven track record? Check and double-check. The funding needed to bring it to reality? Uhh.. wait! No, check! That's right. We have YOU! 
See, if you invest in Staying Vigilant, not only are you bringing a fun and unique idea to life, you're also getting some really cool stuff. With perks like early releases, signed posters, DVDs, walk-on roles, and producer credits, it's a win-win-win. You win, the show wins, everybody wins. Winning feels good, doesn't it?   Explain how much funding you need and where it's going. Be transparent and specific-people need to trust you to want to fund you.  Tell people about your unique perks. Get them excited! Describe where the funds go if you don't reach your entire goal.    CUE THE SARAH MCLACHLAN
With your help today, you can save the lives of our cherished superheroes. They don't understand that their actions have consequences, or that destroying a city block to stop a thief isn't necessarily the right thing to do. Help them learn that teaching teenage sidekicks to hurt people isn't good for the child, that brooding on rooftops and keeping dual identities is no way to behave. With your investment in Staying Vigilant, you'll help make the world brighter... for everyone. Join us today, won't you?",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<br/><div> <h3>THE LIFESAVING MACHINES<br/>
</h3>
<h3></h3>
<p><b>A PHOTOBOOK PROJECT by REINER RIEDLER</b><br/></p>
<p><b>The book:</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>After more then 4 years of intense work I would like to publish a book. The plan is to make a book with the size 23x28 cm, 160 pages, around 80 images, Hardcover. Editing and design are not done yet, but designers already did some drafts, which really look great! So let Yourself surprise!<br/></p>
<p> There are still a few trips to do, but mainly the work is done. The amount I need refers to book design, text + translation and printing/binding costs. For me as an individual it´s a huge amount, which I cannot finance myself. <br/></p>
<p>I hope that the book will become real with the help of this Campaign! Thank You so much for Your participation and support!</p>
<br/><p><b>The Story:</b><br/></p>
<p>In 2011 I visited the neonathology of an Austrian children´s hospital. When I entered the large, dark room for the first time in the middle of the night. Everywhere there were blinking lights and the hum of individual beeping sounds. A small group of newborn children was sleeping here.<br/></p>
<p>This moment, which I will never forget, was the starting point for my photoproject. I sought to make accessible a taboo topic without depicting any suffering and without compromising people in difficult circumstances. I had to tell the story in a different manner. <br/></p>
<p>Slowly, I began to collect images of historical and contemporary devices, photographed before a dark background - isolated from the environment in which they were used - to direct the attention entirely to their function and their peculiar aesthetics.</p>

A PHOTOBOOK PROJECT by REINER RIEDLER
The book:

After more then 4 years of intense work I would like to publish a book. The plan is to make a book with the size 23x28 cm, 160 pages, around 80 images, Hardcover. Editing and design are not done yet, but designers already did some drafts, which really look great! So let Yourself surprise!
 There are still a few trips to do, but mainly the work is done. The amount I need refers to book design, text + translation and printing/binding costs. For me as an individual it´s a huge amount, which I cannot finance myself. 
I hope that the book will become real with the help of this Campaign! Thank You so much for Your participation and support!
The Story:
In 2011 I visited the neonathology of an Austrian children´s hospital. When I entered the large, dark room for the first time in the middle of the night. Everywhere there were blinking lights and the hum of individual beeping sounds. A small group of newborn children was sleeping here.
This moment, which I will never forget, was the starting point for my photoproject. I sought to make accessible a taboo topic without depicting any suffering and without compromising people in difficult circumstances. I had to tell the story in a different manner. 
Slowly, I began to collect images of historical and contemporary devices, photographed before a dark background - isolated from the environment in which they were used - to direct the attention entirely to their function and their peculiar aesthetics.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>The Last Architect is a short film exploring the relationship between two generations. It pays homage to an industry and its workers that are now forgotten, paying tribute to these men that risked their lives daily to create prosperities for small towns. Giving light to the struggles these men faced, we feel we need to tell this part of history before it's forgotten.</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>So far the crew have managed to raise £2000 but we need to raise a further £3500 to make this ambitious project do justice to the people the film is inspired by.</p>
<p>So far we have managed to raise £2000 by begging our friends and families to support our project as much as they can but we need your help to help raise the further £3500. This money will allow us to hire better equipment to make a nicer looking and sounding film, hire the right actor to portray the beautifully written characters and to make sure that all the crew that are working for free are well fed and sustained to keep them constantly creative.  </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1474406189/giserkmav6cfu1glxjx3.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>We have some amazing perks to offer people who help make this project come to life. Perks such as early access to a digital version of the film, a physical DVD (or Blu-ray) copy of the film upon release, an a4 copy of the official poster, a custom mug, associate and executive producer credits, and also a chance to come to the films first screening. </p>
<p>Those that contribute, share and like our Facebook page will be kept updated during the entire film and also the success after the film has been made.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We have a large team hard at work in different departments to try and make the best film we can, but we need your help to make everyones dream come to life and create the film we all envision. </p>
<p>The team have been making short films together for the past 4 years and have had numerous successes in the film festival circuits with some members winning awards. All members of the crew were commissioned by the UK arts council to make a film for consideration to be part of Channel 4's random acts stream. With a wealth of experience and professionalism you will be investing in a crew you can trust.</p>

</div></div>","Short Summary
The Last Architect is a short film exploring the relationship between two generations. It pays homage to an industry and its workers that are now forgotten, paying tribute to these men that risked their lives daily to create prosperities for small towns. Giving light to the struggles these men faced, we feel we need to tell this part of history before it's forgotten.

 

What We Need & What You Get
So far the crew have managed to raise £2000 but we need to raise a further £3500 to make this ambitious project do justice to the people the film is inspired by.
So far we have managed to raise £2000 by begging our friends and families to support our project as much as they can but we need your help to help raise the further £3500. This money will allow us to hire better equipment to make a nicer looking and sounding film, hire the right actor to portray the beautifully written characters and to make sure that all the crew that are working for free are well fed and sustained to keep them constantly creative.  

We have some amazing perks to offer people who help make this project come to life. Perks such as early access to a digital version of the film, a physical DVD (or Blu-ray) copy of the film upon release, an a4 copy of the official poster, a custom mug, associate and executive producer credits, and also a chance to come to the films first screening. 
Those that contribute, share and like our Facebook page will be kept updated during the entire film and also the success after the film has been made.

The Impact
We have a large team hard at work in different departments to try and make the best film we can, but we need your help to make everyones dream come to life and create the film we all envision. 
The team have been making short films together for the past 4 years and have had numerous successes in the film festival circuits with some members winning awards. All members of the crew were commissioned by the UK arts council to make a film for consideration to be part of Channel 4's random acts stream. With a wealth of experience and professionalism you will be investing in a crew you can trust.

<h3>Who I am: My Story-</h3>
<p>My story is a complicated one...complicated because, <strong>I shouldn't be making this film</strong>; I shouldn't even be <i>here</i> in the first place. My name is Kayla Keen, the director and writer of the upcoming short film ""The Home"". Allow me to tell you my story. When I was still in my mother’s womb, all the tests that my mother was given defined me as <strong>incomplete</strong>. The results determined that my <strong>brain was not developed</strong> and that, on the slim chance I happened to survive after birth, I would live with severe complications and not be able to do, <i>or be,</i> much of anything. </p>
<p>My mother was constantly told to terminate the pregnancy; terminate me. This was for her benefit and her quality of life she was assured. But my mother is a smart woman and I wish I had her faith because, whether I'd be with her for 50 years, 5 days, or just 5 minutes, <strong>she still chose me</strong>.  Twenty one years later, now that I have the means, tools, and people to bring it justice, I have a story to tell. It's about the <i>Sanctity Of Life</i>; a topic that is so readily ignored in society today.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">
<i>Our story </i>begins.....</h2>
<p>               Amidst the penniless, jobless, and pure down on their luck, a boarding house, affectionately called ""The Home” opens its doors once again despite the hard times. But not everything is as it seems.  Here, works Mara, a charming woman who offers our main character, Jefferson, the job of groundskeeper for the estate. All seems to be well, that is until Jefferson’s curiosity brings him to question the work of The Home. When his inquiries are met with nothing but disregard and redirection, he sets out to find the answers for himself. But what he discovers behind the door at the end of the hall is a truth so sinister he wishes he could forget. With The Home’s secrets revealed, Jefferson must make the choice between losing the job his young family so desperately needs, or to close the doors, sealing Mara’s secrets indefinitely and thus, going against everything he believes in.</p>

<p>This story represents the battle pro-life faces against an opponent that has been exposed but is <strong>still protected and</strong> <strong>thriving in plain sight</strong>.  We ask for your support in the making of this film.

<p>This story I am up against feels like a <strong>giant</strong>. The fact of the matter is, this project is going to get made. But to make it the best it can be, we need <u>YOU!</u> The budget for this film is set at only $4,000; a very reasonable goal for a short film of this magnitude. The good news? <strong>We have already raised 1/2 of our budget.</strong> We are asking for your help to match our current funds and play a major role in helping us finally fulfill our projected budget! Every penny you donate will go towards:</p>
</div><div>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Locations: </strong>The main concern here is The Home. Because it is the main focus of the entire film, we have been looking for months at plantations and estates trying to find the perfect setting that will be the focal point of our story.</li>
<li>
<strong>Food for Cast and Crew: </strong>My motto for set: Fed well, works well. Help me provide meals for those giving their time and talents.</li>
<li>
<strong>Transportation:</strong> Because we will be using large and/or fragile pieces of professional equipment, part of the budget will go towards renting a truck to safely and easily transport our equipment to and from location.</li>
<li>
<strong>Set design/Wardrobe: </strong>For the past several months, we have been collecting antiques and clothing pieces that would fit into our 1930's/1940's styled era.

0,"<div class=""routerContentStory-storyBody"" data-v-1df7bf5a=""""><div> <h3>Short Summary</h3> <p>Each summer in the city of Yulin, China, a special festival is held- the Yulin Dog Festival. You might think they celebrate dogs, but no, <b>they slaughter</b> <b>thousands of dogs </b>for human consumption. <b>Often they are stolen pets</b> (including military and police dogs) who are shipped in dirty, cramped, inhumane conditions thousands of miles to the dog meat market without food or water. <b>Many die in transit</b>, and those who survive meet a gruesome and brutal demise. <br/></p>
<p>My name is Sarah Spicer. I am a <b>documentary producer and director </b>and avid animal lover, though I feel especially close to dogs. As I write this, I have a puppy and two golden retrievers sleeping at my feet. They bring immense happiness to my life.</p>
<p>While researching for a documentary on the benefits of raw dog food, I came across the matter of the <b>dog meat trade in China</b>, a heavy subject that plagues both the people and the dogs of China, as well as dog lovers worldwide. I had first seen this issue on a Facebook post in the summer however, due to the graphic nature, I acknowledged it and moved on. I could not look. Months later the subject resurfaced and <b>this time I could not turn my back.</b> </p>
<p>Dog meat is considered in China to be especially nourishing, and it is believed that the <b>beating and torture of dogs makes the meat more tender. </b>Those who consume dog meat are extremely passionate about their right to eat dog. Dog meat restaurants thrive in parts of China. <b>Citizens and families are divided over this issue. </b>Those who are opposed to the practice of eating dog meat have gone to great lengths to stop it, including helping dog meat traders find other sources of sustainable income, which I personally find incredibly inspiring. </p>
<p><b>Most of China views and honors dogs as pets,</b> family members and friends. It is estimated that up to 70% of pet owners in China have suffered the loss of a stolen pet assumed to have become a victim of the dog meat trade. </p>
<p><b>Dog meat consumption is not exclusive to China </b>and is more widespread than one would think. It is also consumed in Vietnam, parts of Europe, and in the U.S. backed countries of South Korea and the Philippines. And these are the ones we know about. </p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need </h3> <p>We are seeking $100,000 to expose the reality of the dog meat trade in the this documentary. Our stretch goal is $150,000. </p>
<p>This will cover the following initial costs: </p>
<p>-Roundtrip airfare to China two times (once in the winter and once for the festival in the summer) for crew, security personnel, and gear. </p>
<p>-Hotel, transportation, food and to hire a translator for while in China. </p>

</div></div>","Short Summary Each summer in the city of Yulin, China, a special festival is held- the Yulin Dog Festival. You might think they celebrate dogs, but no, they slaughter thousands of dogs for human consumption. Often they are stolen pets (including military and police dogs) who are shipped in dirty, cramped, inhumane conditions thousands of miles to the dog meat market without food or water. Many die in transit, and those who survive meet a gruesome and brutal demise. 
My name is Sarah Spicer. I am a documentary producer and director and avid animal lover, though I feel especially close to dogs. As I write this, I have a puppy and two golden retrievers sleeping at my feet. They bring immense happiness to my life.
While researching for a documentary on the benefits of raw dog food, I came across the matter of the dog meat trade in China, a heavy subject that plagues both the people and the dogs of China, as well as dog lovers worldwide. I had first seen this issue on a Facebook post in the summer however, due to the graphic nature, I acknowledged it and moved on. I could not look. Months later the subject resurfaced and this time I could not turn my back. 
Dog meat is considered in China to be especially nourishing, and it is believed that the beating and torture of dogs makes the meat more tender. Those who consume dog meat are extremely passionate about their right to eat dog. Dog meat restaurants thrive in parts of China. Citizens and families are divided over this issue. Those who are opposed to the practice of eating dog meat have gone to great lengths to stop it, including helping dog meat traders find other sources of sustainable income, which I personally find incredibly inspiring. 
Most of China views and honors dogs as pets, family members and friends. It is estimated that up to 70% of pet owners in China have suffered the loss of a stolen pet assumed to have become a victim of the dog meat trade. 
Dog meat consumption is not exclusive to China and is more widespread than one would think. It is also consumed in Vietnam, parts of Europe, and in the U.S. backed countries of South Korea and the Philippines. And these are the ones we know about.    What We Need  We are seeking $100,000 to expose the reality of the dog meat trade in the this documentary. Our stretch goal is $150,000. 
This will cover the following initial costs: 
-Roundtrip airfare to China two times (once in the winter and once for the festival in the summer) for crew, security personnel, and gear. 
-Hotel, transportation, food and to hire a translator for while in China. 
-Visas/Passports and equipment
-Airfare and travel costs around the United States to interview activists, experts, scholars and policy makers
-Production and post productions cost including music score, editing, sound design, and master of the film. 
-P.R./Marketing and Social Media to push this film worldwide (the more people who know about it, the greater chance we have of making a difference)
-Rental costs to screen the film in theatres in Los Angeles and New York City
-Film festival submission and travel costs 
If we do not meet these goals we will continue our fundraising efforts privately. The funds we do receive will go towards as much of the production as we can afford.

   The Impact When this film is shown around the world, more people, cultures and nations will be motivated to be involved in helping create change. The more people who know, the more can be done to change or stop the dog meat trade altogether. Your contribution is the first step toward eradicating the suffering of the dogs who fall victim, and the families whose pets are subjected to the inhumane conditions of the dog meat trade.    
Risks & Challenges Our greatest risk in doing this film is being prevented from filming in Yulin, China at the annual summer dog meat eating festival. Tensions are already high in that city due to the negative publicity the annual festival receives worldwide, and they do not like people coming to film the events there.

<h3>Do You Know the Red Rock Canyons of the Dolores River? Few Do These
Days...</h3>
<p><b><a href=""http://doloresriverboating.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Dolores River Boating Advocates</a> </b>works to protect and
enhance the environmental and recreational qualities of the Dolores River, which have been compromised by the loss of river flows in this amazing watershed.  We want to raise awareness about the Dolores River so people today and future generations have the opportunity to experience the unique and precious values of the lower Dolores River corridor. We have teamed up with filmmakers <b><a href=""http://www.rigtoflip.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Rig to Flip</a> </b>to highlight these amazing attributes and the complexity of the situation.<br/></p>
<h3>The Dolores River Needs to Run Again!</h3>
<p>Help us reach our goal of $10,000.00 and bring this story to the world.
We've received some fantastic support from our current film
sponsors- Patagonia, Osprey and American Whitewater.  Now it's time to
turn to our greatest resource, YOU, the people!   We need your involvement. Help us raise funds to finish a film that will bring
attention to this endangered tributary of the Colorado River. While the film is almost completed, it's
a complex and controversial story that is far from finished... </p>
<h3></h3>
<p></p>
<h3>
Project Summary </h3>
<p>The Dolores River was named the ""River of Sorrows"" by early Spanish explorers, though they never could have guessed how ironic that 
name would become.  The water of the Dolores River today is a fully-allocated resource. A transbasin diversion takes the water from the Dolores River basin through the Dolores-San Juan Divide via the Great Cut Dike to serve the agricultural 
communities of Southwest Colorado in the San Juan Basin. But at what cost? With persistent 
drought, threatened native fish species, and increased agricultural demand the impacts are significant.  Stakeholders have been working for many years for a collaborative 
solution but community consensus remains elusive. And while the construction of McPhee
Dam was a boon to the agricultural economy of southwest Colorado, the river
was highly compromised and the boating recreation economy
of the Dolores River dissolved. What kind of future will the next generation inherit with this river? <br/></p>
<p>""River of Sorrow"" is a film that reflects the many perspectives community members have around the Dolores River and points a spotlight on the challenges of managing this public resource.  This film will show the
complexity and the urgency in helping the river flow and highlight the many
livelihoods that the river presently supports and supported once before.  We need your help to take this film across
the finish line and to draw awareness to this issue which is not isolated to the Dolores, but rather begs greater questions around water use, living rivers, and the future of Western water.  <br/></p>

<h3>About Us</h3>
<a href=""http://doloresriverboating.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Dolores River Boating Advocates</a> (DRBA) is a grassroots organization and preeminent group that is committed
to restoring flows to the Dolores River while also preserving the livelihoods
that depend on the water <i>and</i>
reestablishing enterprises that once relied on the river.<span>  We believe that we can have a healthy and flowing
river <i>as well as</i> healthy and diverse
economies and communities.  We would
like to see flows that support the native fish and riparian habitat implemented annually,
and whitewater boating return to this once world-class river.  <br/></span>
</div> <div> <h3><br/></h3>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>
</p>
<p>Your support will give the Dolores River a voice, the film will tell her story.  What once was a flowing river can 
be again with your help. Your contribution will be used to edit the final 
product and to promote it widely through film festival submissions and 
film venues. Awareness is the first step in creating solutions for the ""River of Sorrows"" so that it can become a river of hope for future 
generations. <br/></p>
<p>Generous support from our sponsors has
provided the capital for the production of the film, and Rig to Flip has
donated countless hours above and beyond the original contract to offer a film
that deeply explores the complexity of the Dolores River. With $10,000 in additional
funding for the project, $6,000 would be committed towards the film’s marketing
and promotion and $4,000 would be committed to the final editing of the film.<span>  Meeting our goal will enable the organization
and the filmmakers to focus on expanding the outreach, and raising the awareness
to a regional and national audience. </span></p>
<p><span>We will market, promote,
and tour the film as far and wide as the budget allows through screenings
with partner organizations and communities throughout the West, and through submissions to the following
film festivals:</span></p>
<p><span>·<span>  </span></span>Telluride Mountainfilm</p>
<p><span>·<span>  </span></span>5 Points Film Festival</p>
<p><span>·<span>  </span></span>The Colorado Environmental Film
Festival</p>
<p><span>·<span>  </span></span>Moab Film Festival</p>
<p><span>·<span>  </span></span>Wild and Scenic Film Festival</p>
<p><span>·<span>  </span></span>National Paddling Film Festival</p>
<p><span>·<span>  </span></span>Sundance</p>
<p><span>·<span>  </span></span>And more!</p>
<p>Our goal is to reach as
many people as possible with this film to expand awareness not just about the
Dolores River, but about many rivers and waterways of the West.  Western water is a commodity, but so are our
rivers.  We want to deepen the
conversation to a level that brings true solutions, which will require true
compromise and even policy changes.  By

Days...
Dolores River Boating Advocates works to protect and
enhance the environmental and recreational qualities of the Dolores River, which have been compromised by the loss of river flows in this amazing watershed.  We want to raise awareness about the Dolores River so people today and future generations have the opportunity to experience the unique and precious values of the lower Dolores River corridor. We have teamed up with filmmakers Rig to Flip to highlight these amazing attributes and the complexity of the situation.
The Dolores River Needs to Run Again!
Help us reach our goal of $10,000.00 and bring this story to the world.
We've received some fantastic support from our current film
sponsors- Patagonia, Osprey and American Whitewater.  Now it's time to
turn to our greatest resource, YOU, the people!   We need your involvement. Help us raise funds to finish a film that will bring
attention to this endangered tributary of the Colorado River. While the film is almost completed, it's
a complex and controversial story that is far from finished... 



Project Summary 
The Dolores River was named the ""River of Sorrows"" by early Spanish explorers, though they never could have guessed how ironic that 
name would become.  The water of the Dolores River today is a fully-allocated resource. A transbasin diversion takes the water from the Dolores River basin through the Dolores-San Juan Divide via the Great Cut Dike to serve the agricultural 
communities of Southwest Colorado in the San Juan Basin. But at what cost? With persistent 
drought, threatened native fish species, and increased agricultural demand the impacts are significant.  Stakeholders have been working for many years for a collaborative 
solution but community consensus remains elusive. And while the construction of McPhee
Dam was a boon to the agricultural economy of southwest Colorado, the river
was highly compromised and the boating recreation economy
of the Dolores River dissolved. What kind of future will the next generation inherit with this river? 
""River of Sorrow"" is a film that reflects the many perspectives community members have around the Dolores River and points a spotlight on the challenges of managing this public resource.  This film will show the
complexity and the urgency in helping the river flow and highlight the many
livelihoods that the river presently supports and supported once before.  We need your help to take this film across
the finish line and to draw awareness to this issue which is not isolated to the Dolores, but rather begs greater questions around water use, living rivers, and the future of Western water.  
Be among the first to view the trailer here!




About Us
Dolores River Boating Advocates (DRBA) is a grassroots organization and preeminent group that is committed
to restoring flows to the Dolores River while also preserving the livelihoods
that depend on the water and
reestablishing enterprises that once relied on the river.  We believe that we can have a healthy and flowing
river as well as healthy and diverse
economies and communities.  We would
like to see flows that support the native fish and riparian habitat implemented annually,
and whitewater boating return to this once world-class river.  
  
What We Need & What You Get


Your support will give the Dolores River a voice, the film will tell her story.  What once was a flowing river can 
be again with your help. Your contribution will be used to edit the final 
product and to promote it widely through film festival submissions and 
film venues. Awareness is the first step in creating solutions for the ""River of Sorrows"" so that it can become a river of hope for future 
generations. 
Generous support from our sponsors has
provided the capital for the production of the film, and Rig to Flip has
donated countless hours above and beyond the original contract to offer a film
that deeply explores the complexity of the Dolores River. With $10,000 in additional
funding for the project, $6,000 would be committed towards the film’s marketing
and promotion and $4,000 would be committed to the final editing of the film.  Meeting our goal will enable the organization
and the filmmakers to focus on expanding the outreach, and raising the awareness
to a regional and national audience. 
We will market, promote,
and tour the film as far and wide as the budget allows through screenings
with partner organizations and communities throughout the West, and through submissions to the following
film festivals:
·  Telluride Mountainfilm
·  5 Points Film Festival
·  The Colorado Environmental Film
Festival
·  Moab Film Festival
·  Wild and Scenic Film Festival
·  National Paddling Film Festival
·  Sundance
·  And more!
Our goal is to reach as
many people as possible with this film to expand awareness not just about the
Dolores River, but about many rivers and waterways of the West.  Western water is a commodity, but so are our
rivers.  We want to deepen the
conversation to a level that brings true solutions, which will require true
compromise and even policy changes.  By
raising awareness and raising the dialogue to a larger arena, we believe that
decision makers will better understand the value of living rivers.  We believe that the ripple effect of this
film will make the future, and the river that future generations inherit, a
better one.
In return, we have some fabulous and
fun perks for participating in this campaign and sponsoring this film.  For instance, river trips and cabin stays on
the Upper Dolores River.  Or how about an
Osprey Pack?  Of course as a film sponsor
you will have options for owning and viewing the film as well.  So please join us today in this exciting
endeavor, and help the Dolores River receive the attention it deserves, for the
sake of all Western rivers.
   Other Ways You Can Help If a financial donation is not in your cards today, you can help in other ways:  Help us get the word out about this campaign with the convenient Indiegogo share tools. Come to a screening of the movie.  We'll be debuting ""The River of Sorrow"" in Dolores, Colorado on Friday, January 15th at the Dolores Community Center at 7PM.  Other screening events will follow.

<p>Paja, Spaho
and Niklovani were teenagers and young men when the war began in Bosnia and
Herzegovina in the spring of 1992. They suddenly found themselves holding weapons and
defending their Olympic city, Sarajevo, as it endured the longest siege in
modern history (1425 days). The war ended in November 1995 with a peace
agreement made in Dayton, Ohio.</p>
<p>Today they
are middle-aged, and have had children, marriages and divorces. They have
cook-outs up in the mountains where they used to fight.  The days in the siege were the best and the
worst in their lives, as they look back on the past and forward to the second
halves of their lives in a country with an uncertain future.</p>
<p>This
November diplomats and talking heads in the US and Europe are celebrating 20
years of post-war peace in Bosnia. </p>
<p>But what do
the guys who were forced to fight think about life and peace 20 years later? </p>
<p><b><i>No
one invited these guys to Dayton in 1995 - but they’re going to the US this
month to tell their story and ask questions.</i></b></p>
<p>***</p>
<p>We’re
sending these three guys to the United States to ask questions and get
answers.  The team is visiting New York
City, Dayton, and Washington, DC. We’re meeting journalists, policymakers,
professors and artists. We’re also participating in the “Dayton Peace Accords at
20” conference at the University of Dayton.</p>
<p>In addition
to asking some serious questions, we want to have some fun: we want to see how
long Spaho can go without a cigarette; how Niklovani will react to a Starbucks
menu; and how long it will take Paja to get slapped by a woman in a bar.</p>
<p>Think
Michael Moore meets Borat.</p>
<p>We’re couch-surfing. The team is all
volunteer. Your contribution can help us with filming, pre-and post-trip
logistics, and will help us eat more than street vendor hotdogs while
stateside. We would also like to ensure solid trailers, post-production
quality, and aggressive distribution, and will professionalize the crew as much
as possible while maintaining our creative vision.</p>
<p>Our team
has the skills we need: An extroverted barfly. A political junkie. A television
director. An Internet addict. A chain smoker. A former puppet wrangler. A guy
who polished his gun with sandpaper during the war to make it shiny.</p>
<p>Bosnia is not
unique; normal people are currently suffering at the hands of warlord politics
in Syria, Iraq, Libya and other global hotspots. What will their countries look
like when the shooting stops?????</p>
<p>We can
learn from these guys.</p>
<p>Help us to
change the way people think about war, peace and international policy. </p>
<p>Help us to
show the side of war and peace you DON’T usually hear about. </p>
<p>And meet a
fun group of guys who will make you want to come party in Sarajevo.</p>
<p><b><u>The Process</u></b></p>
<p>The
all-volunteer team has a 5-stage process to make this vision a reality, and
your donation will support this initiative from beginning to end:</p>
<p><b><i>1.
Pre-trip</i></b></p>
<p>We’ve contacted
policy-makers, professors, journalists and others in Washington, New York and
Dayton, Ohio to set up interviews. We’ve filmed interviews with people in
Sarajevo to ask them what questions the team should ask while in the US. We’ve
done some initial scene-setting filming as well. The guys have received visas
to travel to the US (for the first time!), and we’ve found free accommodations
to help us keep costs down.</p>
<p><b><i>2.
The Trip</i></b></p>
<p>We flew to
the US on November 14. After 2 days in NY City to talk to people
familiar with Bosnia, we came to Dayton, Ohio itself to see where
this peace agreement was born. We’re participating in the Dayton
commemorative conference, together with Bill Clinton and lots of other VIPs.
Then we head to Washington DC to meet some of the people who shaped policies and
the peace then and now.</p>
<p>We also
expect to have some fun – introducing the boys to some of what America has to
offer. </p>
<p><b><i>3.
Post-Trip</i></b></p>
<p>When we get
back we’ll sit down with the group and process the experience. We’ll also film
some post-travel interviews and discussions to figure out how to hit the right
mix of humor and history, and the right blend of the personal and the
political.</p>
<p><b><i>4.
Post-Production</i></b></p>
<p>Once we
have our footage we’ll begin post-production editing, with the goal of a
60-minute film. The more we raise, the higher quality we’ll be able to achieve
– we will do what we can, but would love to tell this story with top quality
editing, color correction, audio engineering and mixing and maybe even some
original scoring.</p>
<p>We’ll also
do test screenings in Sarajevo and other parts of BiH as we refine and edit the
film to make sure the story makes the impact we know it can make.</p>
<p><b><i>5.
Distribution</i></b></p>
<p>Our
audience is broad – the comedy will show a side of Bosnia many people don’t
know, and the serious topics covered will appeal to viewers interested in
international issues of war and peace.</p>
<p>We expect a
strong showing on the festival circuit, in Sarajevo and the region, as well as
in the US. </p>
<p><b><u>Why it Matters</u></b></p>
<p>Sometimes
it seems the world is getting more crazy and violent every day. Bosnia’s
experience offers a lot of lessons for other countries going through violent
conflict and political transition. What’s the right way to end a war, not for
the warlords but for the normal people whose lives are affected by it? It’s
time we heard their perspective, and put them at the table. </p>

<p><b>Our Aims...</b><br/></p>
<p>Winter is very hard on the homeless that roam the streets by day and desperately try to keep warm by night. Their plight is especially tough during the Holiday season when they are so alone with no family, no Thanksgiving feast, no warm Christmas cheer from friends, no gifts under a Christmas tree.

Mission Statement
Brixton Soup Kitchen is a grassroots
organisation helping homeless people and Londoners in need. It provides food,

Company: Friendly faces to shat to and shoulders to lean on

No obligation: You don’t have to prove your living situation or pray for your
     food

Empower: Help people get back on their feet


Who we are
Brixton Soup Kitchen was founded in
January 2013, when Solomon Smith a Lambeth youth worker and lifelong Brixtonian
realised there was a desperate need for such an organisation. We are based in
Brixton Social Club and currently open three days a week. We offer so much more
than hot food and drinks; we provide CV workshops, job guidance and advice on
housing and benefits. 
What we’ve done in our first year
-Served up to 50 people a day food and
hot drinks
-Distributed care packages to those in
need
-Received regular food donations from
Greggs, Pret a Manger and Nando’s
-Become equipped with modern computer
facilities for guests to use
-Helped 3 people get back into full
time employment
-Bought a bicycle for a man who would
walk 3 hours to the Soup Kitchen
-Solomon has received the South London ‘Our Heroes’ Award in 2013 and Co-Director
Mahamed Hashi has been nominated for the 2014 award
-Delivered food to families in need
What we want to achieve
2014:

Raise funds for a van to distribute food and
     care to the homeless across the Lambeth borough
Become a registered charity
More extensive staff training 

Beyond:

Become a recognised support centre for the
     community as a whole. 
Provide extra facilities including job search
     support, advice on housing and benefits and a night shelter for those in
     dire need.
Acquire funding to allow us to be able to apply for passport
     renewals, provisional licences and other forms of essential ID. 

Our Aims...
Winter is very hard on the homeless that roam the streets by day and desperately try to keep warm by night. Their plight is especially tough during the Holiday season when they are so alone with no family, no Thanksgiving feast, no warm Christmas cheer from friends, no gifts under a Christmas tree. Many only have faint childhood memories to fill their souls.
We met Liam sleeping in the bins 2:30am in East London


Brixton Soup Kitchen does outreach in and around London, Lately has become very cold on the streets of London and for that reason we want to buy warm hats, gloves, scarves to help keep the homeless warm this winter.
Last year we gave out 780 Hats & Scarves in and around London and this year we want to give out 1,200



  What We Need & What You GetThe reason why we need £5500 is.....We need £5500 of materials and transport to complete this project..Embroidery BSK logo set up £140Gloves, Hats, with embroidery £4.10 each x 1000 = £4100Scarves 85p x 1000 = £850Transport, Petrol cost ect £250Miscellaneous £160When we DON'T reach our goal we will still use the money rasied to still buy hats and gloves and scarves as we still want to make sure we want the homeless to be warm this winter

<p></p> <p>
</p>
<p>When a lonely man begins getting anonymous erotic phones at work, he lets all other facets of his life fall away until he becomes convinced he must see the person on the other end of the line. Meeting that person becomes a regrettable journey into self-hatred, perversion, and tragic comedy.</p>

<p><i>Smother Me In Hugs</i> is a Columbia University graduate thesis film directed by Eric Schuman. Through the unique genre of dark comedy, Eric is exploring his insecurities and fears by delving into the experience of Garrett, an awkward, socially inept, middle-aged man who's settled for a mediocre life. </p>
<p>The film tackles the themes of masculinity, confidence, and loneliness all through Garrett's eyes and, although very personal to the director, these themes are universal. Everyone understands what it's like to want something that seems out of reach, to be nervous around someone, or to feel out of place. And although we may not have gotten erotic phone calls on our work phone in the middle of the day, everyone understands what it's like to have a secret.</p>
<p>The film received the Emerging Filmmakers award from Columbia University and is currently a semi-finalist for the Screencraft Short Film Production Grant.</p>

 WHAT WE NEED
The film will be shot in New Jersey and New York City in early June of 2016, and all of the funds from this campaign will go towards the following elements of production: 


On-set Meals - Because filmmaking requires people, and people need to eat.

Casting - Finding the right actor for each of the three roles is a crucial part of making this film come to life, and this means hiring a New York City casting director and allowing for time to hold auditions, call-backs, and rehearsals.


Transportation - Imagine yourself on a New York City subway at 5 in the morning; you're carrying a camera, a tripod, lenses, lights, costumes, lunch for 15 people, and a couple of binders. That puddle of juice from the end of the subway car is making it's way towards your Trader Joe's bag, coming closer and closer with each acceleration of the train. Only 45 minutes to go.....Now imagine a passenger van with a spacious trunk, no juice on the ground, gliding along a pre-rush hour highway. I know, we like the second scenario better, too.

Location Fees - One of our locations is a parking lot, and in order to keep our cast and crew as safe as possible we must obtain permits to close down these areas. (We also will be purchasing reflective vests, both because they look really cool, and so we can keep our cast and crew visible and safe.) We'll also be trying filming at a frozen yogurt store and a deli, and may have to pay fees to use these locations as well.


Equipment - Although we will be using some of the equipment provided by Columbia University, we are also going to be renting from other equipment vendors for things like specific camera lenses and lights.

Our Cinematographer - Eric (the Director) and Ben (the Cinematographer) have been friends and collaborators for years, and will be a great team in the making of this film. However Ben lives in LA and we're shooting in the North East, and it might be a little tough for Ben to Skype onto set every day and shout camera directions from a fuzzy, frozen computer screen. In exchange for helping us out for free (!) we're going to fly Ben from LA for a few weeks so that he and Eric can work together on this film.

Editing - Editing goes beyond just putting the clips in the proper order; there's the (expensive) hard drives, making the rough cut, editing the audio and doing a color correction pass, all of which take time, and time is money. 

Every dollar helps us out! Below we've listed a few things that will be covered by your donations:

<h2>Help us make this feature film...</h2>
<p>We have used £1000 of our own money to produce a short Proof Of Concept film over the summer of 2016 and now wish to move on and make the full feature length film.  We have a committed team who want to make this great story into a great film, take a look at what we achieved with £1000 and you will see that with our target amount we can make a great film. </p>
<p>We showed the short to lots of people now and a few of their observations are below...</p>
<h2>Comments So Far</h2>
<h3>"" I enjoyed it. He he did a great job for £1000, these things aren't easy, give the makers my congrats and good luck.""   Phil Davis (Actor: Whitechapel, Poldark, Quadrophenia)</h3>
<p> </p>
<h3>The Long Way Home short is a stunning piece of film. With a solid heart-rending story, it is packed full of great powerful and moving acting, together with stunning authentic costume and locations Simon Golding (Novelist, Scriptwriter, Producer)</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>""This is the kind of film I would like to sit down to watch on Boxing Day afternoon""</p>
<p>""It reminds me of Downton Abbey""</p>
<p>""I didn't want it to end, I wanted to know what happened to Captain Hemmingway""</p>
<p>""I would pay to see just this short film at the cinema""</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>So what is it all about?</h2>
<p>With the approach of the 100th anniversary of the end of The Great War I was compelled to write a film about the experiences of ""Pals Battalions"", made up of volunteers from the Stately Homes, villages and workforces from factories. As the war comes to an end Captain John Hemmingway must decide between following orders or protecting the men under his command.</p>
<p>Our small team have been working on this project for over a year, from the original idea formed a few years ago we first wrote the short script and then began using that as a basis for the longer version. Bringing on board Ben Seager who plays Captain Hemmingway as lead and Mat Hammond as cinematographer gave us the opportunity to move on with the project and produce a Proof Of Concept film over the summer of 2016.</p>
<p>Take a look at it now.</p>

<h3>Jake (Director)</h3>
</div>
<div> </div>
<h2>Where Do We Go From Here</h2>
<p><span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: 16px;font-weight: normal;letter-spacing: 0px;line-height: 26px;'>Our campaign is to allow us to produce the full feature length version of the film. As someone Shropshire born I wanted the story to revolve around the county and its men who went off to the war, an earlier project I worked on with the British Film Institute centred on Prees Heath, a training centre for soldiers and later a military hospital and I felt that it was important to continue their story to the trenches of Belgium.</span></p>
<p>We shot a short 15 minute version of the film this summer on less than £1000, most of which was spent on hiring a uniform for our lead actor (if you know anyone with a WW1 officers uniform then please put them in touch, they are hellishly expensive). The whole team pulled together, taking days off work and staying in the directors home so that they could all travel together and save costs, demonstrating a belief in the project and our ability to create a great film from the script. The costs of such a film can be huge, we don't want to make a film relying on special effects and hundreds of extras though some of these will inevitably be necessary, our film is a more personal journey following one officer and workers from his estate who join up with him.</p>
<div> </div>
<div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>For us the most important thing is to ensure that this film is historically correct, we have a number of military advisors involved including re-enactors who specialise in this period and also Graham Jones, author of the book 'The Apley Legions' the story of the pals who joined up from The Apley Estate near Bridgnorth. </p>
</div>
</div><div>
<h2><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Where The Money Goes</span></h2>
<p><span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: 16px;font-weight: normal;letter-spacing: 0px;line-height: 26px;'>We are seeking £16,000 to make this film. This is a project trimmed to the bone with as much as possible borrowed and begged from anywhere we can. This (very) small sum in film terms allows us to make a great film, if we get more then we can make it even better. The chart below shows how the money would be distributed.</span></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1473862119/edarlkiccfqhtx9rv3mr.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>The biggest expenditure in a film of this type is on locations and costume, one officers uniform for our test shoot this summer cost £600 to hire for a week. For the final film we will need more for longer and the cost will rocket up, of course depending on how much we raise we will cut our cloth accordingly, so a smaller budget will mean fewer officers and a smaller cast all round. Locations are vital to this, we can make a trench look amazing but car noise nearby will ruin the effect, so would an airplane flying over. It is the detail like this and the time it takes to check and double check that ramps up the costs.</p>
<p>Sound is perhaps the most important part of a film, we have all noticed how music can affect a scene but it is the details of the ambient sound too that make a great shot. We need to employ a professional sound recordist, to ensure that the sound is perfect.</p>
<p>While sound is a vital part of the finished film, food is THE vital part of the shoot on set, especially when you are asking your cast to trudge through mud and rain for hours at a time, and then do it again for another take. Coffee to warm people up, water to cool them down and plenty to food to sustain them are vital, we treat everyone on set the way we would want to be treated with a dedicated team to ensure regular supplies.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>How WE reward YOU</h3>
<p>We want investors to feel involved in the project, so we thought long and hard about experiences and opportunities to offer as perks. We have tried to ensure that everyone feels part of the team and so every investor will receive access to a special page on the website where we will provide updates on the film, excerpts from Captain Hemmingway's diary and news of special events amongst other things.</p>
<p>Our range of experience perks are second to none, we start these at a low level of investment and will make these great for all involved. They revolve primarily around involvement in the filming process or the launch of the completed film, we want everyone to feel special and valued.  </p>
<p>Of course you can support us with a contribution without a perk...just click ""Back It"" to the right of the page above the perks section. Whatever you decide, please don't forget to share this page with your friends and anyone that you know would be interested, film buffs, history fanatics etc.</p>
<h2>What Happens If We Don't Make Our Target</h2>
<p>This film is going to be made come what may, we are passionate about the project and WILL SEE IT THROUGH. If we don't reach our goal then we will put every single penny received into making the BEST film we can, just the length and complexity of the story will change.</p>
<p>This is why we chose flexible funding, we know that to persuade strangers to feel trust a young team with their money isn't easy, we know that people are concerned that if the target isn't reached we will just pocket the money ad say ""Oh well, we tried, lets go to the pub"" (none of us drink by the way!). Let me re-iterate, however much we receive at the end of the campaign, every single penny, cent, rupee, washer or piece of Monopoly money will be used to make the best film we are able to on the money we have.</p>
<p>We are not just sitting back and waiting for the money to come in, we are trying everything we can think of too, vintage clothes sales, concerts, a raffle...you name it we are trying it - to raise the money ourselves. </p>
<p>See our Proof Of Concept film below to see what we were able to do with less than £1000,  </p>
<div><h3>The Impact</h3></div>
<div><p>This is a story that we passionately believe in, that we think everyone should see and with the 100 year anniversary of the Armistice approaching this is the perfect time to tell it. There are no survivors of the fighting left now and soon there will be no one left alive who lived through the war at home; It is important to tell their stories, to reflect the huge sacrifices and great toll the war took, often unnecessarily. We plan to offer an educational cut to schools to teach about this time and what ordinary people went through, not a glamorous experience but a dirty, smelly terrifying one...</p></div>

<p>Jake began his professional career as a child actor in the touring production of Disney’s Beauty and the Beast with UK Productions where he played Chip the teacup.  He went on to perform in Fiddler on the Roof, Joseph, Dr Doolittle and many others before turning his mind to music where he spent a couple of years as guitarist in a band, eventually signing to a record label and making 2 music videos before the band unfortunately stalled. He is still a keen guitarist playing at university with colleagues and amongst friends.</p>
<p>Due to a Saturday job working with the Pauline Quirke Academy in Bridgnorth he became interested in film and film making. His first project ‘The Watcher’ received a premier at the Bridgnorth Majestic Cinema before an audience of over 200.  His first  short film 'A Bench On Platform 3' was around 7 minutes long and shot on the platform of the Severn Valley Railway before moving on to 'Droplets' a short psychological film about a hired assassin coming face to face with her nemesis only to realise that she had hired him herself. </p>
<p>Jake is the youngest person ever to qualify to teach the Shakespeare Awards with the world famous Royal Academy of Dramatic Art.  His acting experience and teaching training makes him an ‘actors director’ working with the cast on their performance as well as overseeing the whole production.</p>

We have used £1000 of our own money to produce a short Proof Of Concept film over the summer of 2016 and now wish to move on and make the full feature length film.  We have a committed team who want to make this great story into a great film, take a look at what we achieved with £1000 and you will see that with our target amount we can make a great film. 
We showed the short to lots of people now and a few of their observations are below...
Comments So Far
"" I enjoyed it. He he did a great job for £1000, these things aren't easy, give the makers my congrats and good luck.""   Phil Davis (Actor: Whitechapel, Poldark, Quadrophenia)
 
The Long Way Home short is a stunning piece of film. With a solid heart-rending story, it is packed full of great powerful and moving acting, together with stunning authentic costume and locations Simon Golding (Novelist, Scriptwriter, Producer)
 
""This is the kind of film I would like to sit down to watch on Boxing Day afternoon""
""It reminds me of Downton Abbey""
""I didn't want it to end, I wanted to know what happened to Captain Hemmingway""
""I would pay to see just this short film at the cinema""
 
So what is it all about?
With the approach of the 100th anniversary of the end of The Great War I was compelled to write a film about the experiences of ""Pals Battalions"", made up of volunteers from the Stately Homes, villages and workforces from factories. As the war comes to an end Captain John Hemmingway must decide between following orders or protecting the men under his command.
Our small team have been working on this project for over a year, from the original idea formed a few years ago we first wrote the short script and then began using that as a basis for the longer version. Bringing on board Ben Seager who plays Captain Hemmingway as lead and Mat Hammond as cinematographer gave us the opportunity to move on with the project and produce a Proof Of Concept film over the summer of 2016.
Take a look at it now.

Where Do We Go From Here
Our campaign is to allow us to produce the full feature length version of the film. As someone Shropshire born I wanted the story to revolve around the county and its men who went off to the war, an earlier project I worked on with the British Film Institute centred on Prees Heath, a training centre for soldiers and later a military hospital and I felt that it was important to continue their story to the trenches of Belgium.
We shot a short 15 minute version of the film this summer on less than £1000, most of which was spent on hiring a uniform for our lead actor (if you know anyone with a WW1 officers uniform then please put them in touch, they are hellishly expensive). The whole team pulled together, taking days off work and staying in the directors home so that they could all travel together and save costs, demonstrating a belief in the project and our ability to create a great film from the script. The costs of such a film can be huge, we don't want to make a film relying on special effects and hundreds of extras though some of these will inevitably be necessary, our film is a more personal journey following one officer and workers from his estate who join up with him.
 

Risks & Challenges
For us the most important thing is to ensure that this film is historically correct, we have a number of military advisors involved including re-enactors who specialise in this period and also Graham Jones, author of the book 'The Apley Legions' the story of the pals who joined up from The Apley Estate near Bridgnorth. 


Where The Money Goes
We are seeking £16,000 to make this film. This is a project trimmed to the bone with as much as possible borrowed and begged from anywhere we can. This (very) small sum in film terms allows us to make a great film, if we get more then we can make it even better. The chart below shows how the money would be distributed.

The biggest expenditure in a film of this type is on locations and costume, one officers uniform for our test shoot this summer cost £600 to hire for a week. For the final film we will need more for longer and the cost will rocket up, of course depending on how much we raise we will cut our cloth accordingly, so a smaller budget will mean fewer officers and a smaller cast all round. Locations are vital to this, we can make a trench look amazing but car noise nearby will ruin the effect, so would an airplane flying over. It is the detail like this and the time it takes to check and double check that ramps up the costs.
Sound is perhaps the most important part of a film, we have all noticed how music can affect a scene but it is the details of the ambient sound too that make a great shot. We need to employ a professional sound recordist, to ensure that the sound is perfect.
While sound is a vital part of the finished film, food is THE vital part of the shoot on set, especially when you are asking your cast to trudge through mud and rain for hours at a time, and then do it again for another take. Coffee to warm people up, water to cool them down and plenty to food to sustain them are vital, we treat everyone on set the way we would want to be treated with a dedicated team to ensure regular supplies.
 
How WE reward YOU
We want investors to feel involved in the project, so we thought long and hard about experiences and opportunities to offer as perks. We have tried to ensure that everyone feels part of the team and so every investor will receive access to a special page on the website where we will provide updates on the film, excerpts from Captain Hemmingway's diary and news of special events amongst other things.
Our range of experience perks are second to none, we start these at a low level of investment and will make these great for all involved. They revolve primarily around involvement in the filming process or the launch of the completed film, we want everyone to feel special and valued.  
Of course you can support us with a contribution without a perk...just click ""Back It"" to the right of the page above the perks section. Whatever you decide, please don't forget to share this page with your friends and anyone that you know would be interested, film buffs, history fanatics etc.
What Happens If We Don't Make Our Target
This film is going to be made come what may, we are passionate about the project and WILL SEE IT THROUGH. If we don't reach our goal then we will put every single penny received into making the BEST film we can, just the length and complexity of the story will change.
This is why we chose flexible funding, we know that to persuade strangers to feel trust a young team with their money isn't easy, we know that people are concerned that if the target isn't reached we will just pocket the money ad say ""Oh well, we tried, lets go to the pub"" (none of us drink by the way!). Let me re-iterate, however much we receive at the end of the campaign, every single penny, cent, rupee, washer or piece of Monopoly money will be used to make the best film we are able to on the money we have.
We are not just sitting back and waiting for the money to come in, we are trying everything we can think of too, vintage clothes sales, concerts, a raffle...you name it we are trying it - to raise the money ourselves. 
See our Proof Of Concept film below to see what we were able to do with less than £1000,  
The Impact
This is a story that we passionately believe in, that we think everyone should see and with the 100 year anniversary of the Armistice approaching this is the perfect time to tell it. There are no survivors of the fighting left now and soon there will be no one left alive who lived through the war at home; It is important to tell their stories, to reflect the huge sacrifices and great toll the war took, often unnecessarily. We plan to offer an educational cut to schools to teach about this time and what ordinary people went through, not a glamorous experience but a dirty, smelly terrifying one...
 

Meet The Team
Jake- Director

Jake began his professional career as a child actor in the touring production of Disney’s Beauty and the Beast with UK Productions where he played Chip the teacup.  He went on to perform in Fiddler on the Roof, Joseph, Dr Doolittle and many others before turning his mind to music where he spent a couple of years as guitarist in a band, eventually signing to a record label and making 2 music videos before the band unfortunately stalled. He is still a keen guitarist playing at university with colleagues and amongst friends.
Due to a Saturday job working with the Pauline Quirke Academy in Bridgnorth he became interested in film and film making. His first project ‘The Watcher’ received a premier at the Bridgnorth Majestic Cinema before an audience of over 200.  His first  short film 'A Bench On Platform 3' was around 7 minutes long and shot on the platform of the Severn Valley Railway before moving on to 'Droplets' a short psychological film about a hired assassin coming face to face with her nemesis only to realise that she had hired him herself. 
Jake is the youngest person ever to qualify to teach the Shakespeare Awards with the world famous Royal Academy of Dramatic Art.  His acting experience and teaching training makes him an ‘actors director’ working with the cast on their performance as well as overseeing the whole production.

We have partnered up with Panavision Asia to create this film, and they have been very supportive and excited that people like us still want to shoot on film. They have supplied us with our 35mm camera and lenses, so we are best equipped to make our film. RISK/ChallengersThere are many risks and challenges associated with our film, but none that can't be over come with a little help. Because we have decided to shoot on film there comes there own set of challengers. Costs for us, is a major challenge we have to overcome, cost of film stock, developing, telecine and a lot more. It is all our dreams as filmmakers shoot on film once, for the experience and learning abilities. At the moment we are shooting at a ratio of 2:1!! Which our screen teacher thinks is absolutely crazy! But we need your help with funds to purchase more film stock to increase this ratio to something a little more feasible.We also have the costs of locations, props, costumes ETC..  As this is a period piece there is a lot of production design work to be done. Fortunately for us we have two amazing production designers working day and night at it, but even they need help to buy resources. We would love your help to make sure that our dreams come true and to make the best film we can make. We only have two weeks left before we start shooting so PLEASE HELP US!!How The Funds Will Be UsedThe major cost in our project comes from shooting on film in both pre and post production, but there will also be hidden cost on both sides that we haven’t encountered yet. We will use our production funding on…Film Stock $500We’re excited to be shooting on film but it can be very expensive to purchase and develop stock in Australia as unfortunately us 35mm film shooters are a dying bread and there are not many people that can accommodate us.Developing/Processing/Digitalizing $500Once we have shot we have to send the exposed film away to be processed and converted to a digital hard drive so we can start editing it.Production Design $1000We are excited to shoot a period piece but with period pieces come big costs. The costs of costumes, renting a car from the 80’s, and designing a whole house in 80's style.These are the three main cost we are struggling with a bit at the moment but we will over come them. If you have any questions at all don't hesitate to message me via email or facebook and I will try to answer you as soon as possible. Even if you cannot support the project finically there are other ways to support us, like sharing our crowd funding online with your friends, liking our page or donation any props or location you think are appropriate to our film as well as film stock.I have been working in the film industry for the past two year, working on various different projects in both London and Sydney.

<h3>Who We Are &amp; What We Are Doing</h3>
<p>The Paper Football League is a team of passionate filmmakers looking to make clever, entertaining, original films for the indie circuit. Our current project is titled Railed, a dark but humorous story of two damaged people on a final adventure before they jump in front of a train to end it all. The Paper Football League is a fledgling group with no real funding, and we plan to be as creative as we can with that in mind. While we know we can make nothing go a long way, we would be so grateful to have the opportunity to make a little bit go even further.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>We are looking to raise a minimum of $1100. This will go toward some basic expenses, which we will detail below. Should we raise more than that, we hope to put it toward entering in other festivals, compensating our talent, and The Paper Football League's other productions. </p>
<p><strong>Our expenses</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Craft services for 15 people, for 7 days of shooting</li>
<li>A generator set up for night shoots (rental)</li>

<li>Props</li>
<li>Cast and Crew shirts (only if we exceed goal)</li>
<li>Compensation for talent (only if we exceed goal)</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Why You Want In</h3>
<p>The Paper Football League is in its infancy, but the team is already doing more in just one short month than any of us envisioned, and we are gaining traction. This initiative is going to foster amazing collaborations of filmmakers, bringing freshness to the Indie Film scene, and it's all happening in Columbus! This is an excellent opportunity for anyone interested in being a part of enhancing the art scene in this city, and bringing something exciting and new to the area. Who doesn't want to look back and say, ""I was there when it all began."" Your support means everything to us!</p>

Upset, dejected and distraught, he realizes he doesn't even have enough money to pay for his last drink.When the bar owner realizes Jose can't pay, he orders him to leave. Defeated, Jose begins to leave however, he notices a stunning woman walking in and is immediately captivated by her beauty, elegance and femininity.  He approaches her, with one last hope.She first ignores him then outright rejects him, but with nothing to lose, he makes one last attempt. Intrigued by his confidence and determination, she accepts his first dance to test him, to see if he really can - tango.She joins him in the dance near the tavern's window with moonbeams shining through. At first the gestures are small and conservative, a slight move here and a little tug there.  But their moves are in sync and his will and determination is sound.The dance gets more intense heating up as the arousal and the intrigue grow.  She is beginning to see who he really is and is slowly starting to warm up to him. The passion, desire and intensity grow as they dance in the moonlit bar.Just as he believes they are finally connecting, the bar owner rips him away from his new partner and tosses him out into the lonely night and tells him, “a poor man will never be with my daughter.”Alone and broke, Jose's last flicker of hope has been extinguished.  His only company is now the shimmering Full Moon.  Jose curses the moon; how can it be so bright and beautiful shining happily on this hopeless world?  Distraught, Jose is ready to give up on love, but is love ready to give up on him? There are many ways you can help us to get this short film made.  First, you could provide us with a donation.

<h3>What is Paint?</h3>
<p>Paint is much more than just a short film. Paint is about fighting for life, for happiness and for color. <u>It's that little spark, the one that will never go out.</u> </p>
<p>Paint is for the child in all of us, who just loves coloring books.</p>
<p>My name is Nina Borghi and oh man, is it great to be talking to you. I am a young filmmaker who honestly just wants to make beautiful films about things that matter. I'm Brazilian, but currently live in Los Angeles and attend Relativity School, a really cool college inside a working film studio. </p>
<p>I know that asking for money can be a difficult and delicate thing, and I almost didn't do it. But if I didn't, Paint would exist, and I couldn't allow that. Because it needs to exist. I need to spread this message that really should to be heard. A message saying that even when life is at it's worse, the key to happiness is within ourselves. You only have to dig deep to find it.</p>
<p>And Mika, my main character, does. And in the process, she finds treasures you wouldn't imagine. She is here to show that color, art and creativity are our most powerful weapon against pain and misfortune. And in the meantime, I guarantee you she's gonna have some fun!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>You should know how you're helping by donating. So let's break this down:</p>
<ul>
<li>I need to raise US$3000. It seems like a lot, I know. Making movies is expensive, and that sucks sometimes. But the fact is that Paint need a lot of props, set dressing and, of course, paint. So most of my budget will be directed toward the Art Department, so ensure that Paint looks as colorful as it should be. </li>
<li>Another large part of the funds raised will go to my actors, who deserve to be paid  for exposing themselves to such a delicate and intimate subject. </li>
<li>And if all goes well, which let's hope it does, Paint will be submitted to Festivals! Entree Fees are also part of the budget, much like another very cool thing:</li>
<li>PERKS! -- Everybody who helps me to get closer to my goal will get super cool rewards and different symbols of appreciation, all from the bottom of my heart. Who here wants to have their very own Paint paint jar? What about a DVD with a copy of this lovely lovely project? Check out all the perks you can get with your amazing donation!</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Paint is about Mika, but it is also about every child who has their childhood taken away from them, one way or another. And how does Paint help?</p>
<ul>
<li>It shows that happiness is within ourselves, and so, it is always within our reach!</li>
<li>Gives children hope, possibility. Do you know of anyone who'd benefit from watching Paint? I know I do, and I want to make sure that this film has the power to influence those people and change their lives for the better!</li>
<li>And also, confession time: this is a big deal for me, in the most selfish of ways. I care so much about this story, and to make it come true would be such a huge personal and professional achievement.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>I know that some people just can't contribute, and that's totally okay. But that doesn't mean you can't help!</p>
<ul>
<li>Get the word out! There is a super big chance you may know someone who can donate!</li>

<h3>What's the film about?</h3>
<p>The film is about Richard, a twenty-eight-year-old man who recently had to face a life-altering complication. As a result, Richard hides the worry through wearing a giant, fully headed, chicken mask. This new adjustment does not come easy for his girlfriend, Penelope. As the two of them begin a life together in one home, the mask starts to take its toll. A promise is made between the couple to improve on their weaknesses in order to live a happy life together… However, while the idea may have seemed simple to agree upon, promises are made to be broken.</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>I couldn't be more grateful for your help! It’s people like you that contribute to the career paths of young filmmakers and put faith into independent filmmaking. As a young, female, filmmaker, I feel as though my dreams are coming true as this project comes to life. In the industry, producing a film on your own is a difficult task to achieve. I'm proud to say that I will be writing, directing, and producing this short film! We want this film to showcase the team's talent by giving you an absolutely absurd dark comedy.  If you felt this project was worth donating to, please spread the word! As this film is a big deal to me and the people involved, we want it to be an even bigger deal for the film industry. Share our campaign with others and do us a favor! Thank you so much for the love and support!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The mask is such an important part of the film. Its look, its functions, its designs, are crafted for your enjoyment. A challenge for this film will be creating the right kind of mask that an actor can tolerate wearing while still creating the perfect “look” for the main character. Having the mask be HAND-MADE will mean affording to gather proper material and put the hours into creating TWO identical sets. </p>

<p>Complications can come from using a live animal on set. Spoiler! A real chicken will be used during the filming of Richard. To ensure safety, an animal wrangler will be needed to make sure that no harm comes to any person or the animal.</p>
<p>Inclement weather happens. The film does take place outside in its most key moments, and unfortunately, water, and camera gear does not mix. We hope to use some of these funds to play it safe and ensure our gear against any possible damage. </p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Though some people can't contribute money, that's not all that we are asking for! Spread the word to your family members, co-workers, friends, peers, neighbors, friends of friends, and others! The word of mouth is powerful and we are thankful for any kind of support and attention that is brought to our campaign. Social media will play a big part in fundraising by spreading the word through sites such as Facebook and Twitter.

<div><p>Log Line- Olive, a troubled young artist, goes for a drive one restless night to quiet the obsessive thoughts that are swirling around in her head, and finds that her troubles run deeper than she thought. </p></div>
<div>My name is Tristian Montgomery. I am the writer and director of this project. Making this film is important to me because it's my first chance to make a short film without boundaries. Being a film student, I was given limitations and guidelines to follow that didn't help me produce the caliber of work that I wanted. Long story short, this is a chance for me to create a film that is my full vision. Basically, this story is my baby. By contributing to this film you will help me give birth to a body of work that will truly show what I have to offer to this world.</div>
<div>This film will be my senior capstone film, which I hope to use to make my mark on the Independent Film Festival Circuit.<br/>
</div>
<div>This is also a chance to contribute to the promotion of leading roles for female people of color in Sci-fi and fantasy films. </div>

Log Line- Olive, a troubled young artist, goes for a drive one restless night to quiet the obsessive thoughts that are swirling around in her head, and finds that her troubles run deeper than she thought. 
My name is Tristian Montgomery. I am the writer and director of this project. Making this film is important to me because it's my first chance to make a short film without boundaries. Being a film student, I was given limitations and guidelines to follow that didn't help me produce the caliber of work that I wanted. Long story short, this is a chance for me to create a film that is my full vision. Basically, this story is my baby. By contributing to this film you will help me give birth to a body of work that will truly show what I have to offer to this world.
This film will be my senior capstone film, which I hope to use to make my mark on the Independent Film Festival Circuit.

This is also a chance to contribute to the promotion of leading roles for female people of color in Sci-fi and fantasy films. 
The thing that makes this film Sci-fi is its strong spider motif that appears throughout the story. 
Olive, the main character, struggles with the task of killing a huge spider that has taken over her room. Why does she hesitate? Maybe she see that she has somethings in common with the creature...

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>I am Johnny Perkins, executive producer for Hits: No Morals. I have had a camera in my hand since I was 8 years old and all I have ever wanted to do was create. Several years ago I wrote a short about 2 hitmen who were driving together and both were told to kill the other. This was a comedy. The awkward situation had potential, we wrote and shot it quickly. After I put the video up my roommate from college, who wrote it for me, said he could make it into a series and my response was, if you write it, I'll make it. A few months later we had a script and we went to work. </p>
<p>Season 1 had many flaws but it was essential to put it out as fast as possible before we lost momentum. Now with season 1 out and finished we moved onto season 2, we decided this is where we would do it right. It took 2 years for the scripts to all be written and we now have 10 amazing episodes. We have done table reads and cast many new actors into our family. We want to make this season right. </p>
<p>Making this season right is very important, everyone involved is in it for the passion and love of filmmaking. We love the script and we are a family now. Contributors will become a part of our family and help us create the best possible show. And we don't want to stop with No Morals, we have other shorts and seasons ready to go and we just need to get this first push. This is the beginning of something much bigger for us and we hope you help us get there. </p>

<h3>FAQ's</h3>
<ul>
<li style=""margin-left:40px;"">
<strong>1) When will the rewards become available or ship? </strong>Each perk has an Estimated Delivery month listed in the description. You will be notified of any delays. The script will be sent to you on, or after, the movie is released.</li>
<li style=""margin-left:40px;"">
<strong>2) What name can I use for the ""Special Thanks Film Credit"" perk?</strong> We expect you to use your real name and we will ask you for your real name as part of the campaign survey at the end of the campaign. We may ask for a copy of proof of your real name and identity. You may use someone else's name (family or friend) if you are offering the perk as a gift. Just let us know in the survey.</li>
<li style=""margin-left:40px;"">
<strong>3) Shirt, Hoodie, Jacket Sizes - How do I give you the size(s) I want for any garment items? </strong>When the campaign has ended, we will email you a survey asking for all the sizing information we need to fulfill your perk. You can also give us your shipping information and any other information we may ask for. We will need all of your information and details as soon as possible after the survey is sent.</li>
<li style=""margin-left:40px;"">
<strong>4) What if the perk I want is sold out?</strong> Sorry! When items are sold.....they are sold!</li>
<li style=""margin-left:40px;"">
<strong>5) Can I claim more than one perk?</strong> YES! Each perk that you contribute to is counted as a separate contribution. If you want another item, you will have to select it and contribute again for that perk.</li>
<li style=""margin-left:40px;"">
<strong>6) Can I change my perk?</strong> No! Sorry! We are unable to help with that. Be sure to select the perk you want before you make any contribution(s).</li>
<li style=""margin-left:40px;"">
<strong>7) What if I move or change my address?</strong> If you move before the perks are shipped, contact us immediately through your Indiegogo account and we'll do our best to make the change.</li>
<li style=""margin-left:40px;"">
<strong>8) Can I make a pledge or contribution for a family member or friend?</strong> You can make your pledge for anyone you want! Be sure to provide us with the person's information when we send out our surveys. You will be able to specify who you want the perk to go to.</li>
<li style=""margin-left:40px;"">
<strong>9) I posted a question to the campaign. Will I get a response?</strong> This campaign is a MASSIVE UNDERTAKING! We get many questions every day and we will try to answer back if possible. Please be assured that we do read all questions and concerns in our efforts to help everyone and run a smooth campaign as much as possible.</li>
<li style=""margin-left:40px;"">
<strong>10) What country is the campaign perks offered to?</strong> Everything is offered to the U.S. ONLY! However, we do have an item or two offered strictly to the U.K. as well. THAT'S IT!</li>
<li style=""margin-left:40px;"">
<strong>11) When will the movie be released in theaters?</strong> If our campaign is successful, we plan to film by the end of this year. A release generally takes another 4 months after post-production is completed. (film editing, soundtrack added, etc...)</li>
<li style=""margin-left:40px;"">
<strong>12) When will the Red Carpet Premiere be held?</strong> It will be held approximately 2 weeks before the theater release date.</li>
<li style=""margin-left:40px;"">
<strong>13) Will the CAST SIGNED PHOTO SET have the actor's pictures depicted in the campaign?</strong> My cast members have tried in their best efforts to submit the depicted photos you see for this LIMITED EDITION OF 100 set. However, some cast members are getting new photos. This happens all the time. Therefore, you may not receive the exact photo depicted for each actor. We hope you will still enjoy your set. FOR A CAST SET OF 14 or more photos at the price offering......IT'S QUITE A BARGAIN!</li>
<li style=""margin-left:40px;"">
<strong>14) Are all cast members offering individual photos?</strong> NO! You can only get photos of all cast members in the LIMITED EDITION CAST SIGNED SET! We are only offering individual signed photos from those actors who wish to offer extras for their fans and followers.</li>
<li style=""margin-left:40px;"">
<strong>15) Where will the 2018 NASCAR Event be?</strong> This will be in Las Vegas. It is the PENNZOIL 400 race and fans will attend with some cast members. There will be additional exclusive features with this package.</li>
<li style=""margin-left:40px;"">
<strong>​16) Why will it take so long to receive most of these items?</strong> The campaign will end in approximately 60 days or sooner. When it ends, then we have to wait for Indiegogo to transfer the funds from the campaign to us. When we finally do get all the funds, then we have to place our orders with all the vendors/manufacturers for the perks. <strong>Any items related to the movie itself, </strong>such as movie tickets, DVD's, 4k downloads, production photo cards, etc..., must wait until either during the filming of the movie or when the movie is filmed and completed before we can fulfill those perks. It takes time to setup a full blown production and get to actual filming. Therefore, your patience will be required as we will work as quickly as possible to get this movie made and get your perks to you. We appreciate your support and your patience more than you'll ever truly know! Just as Chris Routhe says in his video. THANK YOU!</li>

<h3>What if the ""Golden Girls met Breaking Bad?""</h3>
<p>What if you lost all your retirement savings in a<strong> Ponzi Scheme</strong>, and had nothing left in the bank? How far would you go to get it back, and help a <strong>friend in need</strong>?</p>
<p>Well ""Nana's Secret Recipe"" is a film that will remind you of the <strong>good ole' days </strong>of zany movies from the <strong>80s and 90s.</strong></p>
<p>The film is<strong> laugh out loud funny</strong>, has great <strong>strong female characters over the age of 60</strong>, and is all about the importance of<strong> friendship</strong> and <strong>sisterhood</strong>.  </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1501395079/te7d710nk8xsiz7yhmzz.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>My name is Mehul Shah, and I'm a filmmaker who wants to make films that are not only <strong>entertaining and engaging</strong>, but have a<strong> strong social message.</strong></p>
<p>I found ""Nana's Secret Recipe"" to be an endearing  script from first time writer Yolanda Avery that not only touches the heart strings but makes you laugh out loud. It reminds me of  <strong>""Steel Magnolias,"" </strong>stressing the importance of a strong female community rallying together for a good cause.</p>
<p><a href=""https://www.kinetikfilms.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Check out more from Kinetik Films, LLC</a></p>
<p>Those who contribute will not only be able to have their name on a film that stresses these important life lessons, but will also get access to <strong>exclusive behind the scenes content </strong>that will let you experience the thrill of being on a movie set!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We're halfway there. But we need the extra push to make this film really <strong>shine</strong>. Getting the right look to make this film as<strong> candy sweet</strong> and<strong> beautiful </strong>as we can, recruiting a strong wardrobe and art department, hair and makeup, and authentic Southern locations.</p>
<p>We've already found our nanas that are going to bring the characters to life, and we need to make sure that we have enough funds to get this film through<strong> post-production (color correction, sound mixing, music composition)</strong> so we have the opportunity to submit to the<strong> best film festivals</strong> out there to get our film out for the world to see!</p>
<p><a href=""http://www.kelliesbakingco.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Kellie's Baking Co.</a> has graciously given us the go-ahead to shoot in their gorgeous location in Austin. And they really do stand up to having the best chocolate chip cookies in Austin. Yum!</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1501019554/opskgfvuptd6dugbxcox.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Have you ever wondered what goes into actually making a movie? Well, we plan on giving you an <strong>all-access pass</strong> into the behind the scenes making of the film and you'll be with us <strong>step-by-step</strong> through the process. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>There are so many life lessons in this film.  The importance of<strong> friendship and sisterhood</strong>, the need for the<strong> legalization of medicinal marijuana </strong>for those in pain, the<strong> use of humor </strong>to get through those<strong> difficult times</strong>.  </p>
<p>This will be the fifth film I've produced, and this <strong>fun story </strong>gets me <strong>energized and excited</strong> to show the world how <strong>hilarious</strong> a bunch of Southern ladies can be.  Finding films that pass the <strong><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bechdel_test"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Bechdel Test</a></strong>  are far and few between, and I'm proud to say this film passes it with flying colors.  <strong>Females talking only about men is</strong> <strong>so last century!</strong></p>
<p>The last films I've done have<strong> sold to Netflix, Blockbuster, Amazon,</strong> and numerous retailers including <strong>Walmart and Best Buy</strong>. Having these <strong>established links and relationships </strong>with <strong>distributors </strong>will give it the best chance to get distributed for the world to see.  </p>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
</div><div>
<p>The good news is that we have a <strong>dedicated and experienced </strong>film crew that work within the Austin film industry lined up to make this a success. This film is raring to go and we are dedicated to making this the best possible film we can.  </p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
</div><div>
<p>What makes us different from other Hollywood productions is that we're a modest crew who wants to make the best possible film we can.  We're so lucky to be in the great city of <strong>Austin, TX,</strong> where <strong>southern hospitality</strong> isn't just a saying, but <strong>a way of life!</strong></p>
<p>If you're able to help us find <strong>food donations</strong>, (cast &amp; crew get hungry after shooting 10-12 hour days), <strong>locations </strong>for these lovely ladies Southern homes, or just want to <strong>shadow and assist </strong>and help us on set make this dream a reality, there are plenty of ways you could help ""Nana's Secret Recipe"" come to life. </p>

Well ""Nana's Secret Recipe"" is a film that will remind you of the good ole' days of zany movies from the 80s and 90s.
The film is laugh out loud funny, has great strong female characters over the age of 60, and is all about the importance of friendship and sisterhood.  

My name is Mehul Shah, and I'm a filmmaker who wants to make films that are not only entertaining and engaging, but have a strong social message.
I found ""Nana's Secret Recipe"" to be an endearing  script from first time writer Yolanda Avery that not only touches the heart strings but makes you laugh out loud. It reminds me of  ""Steel Magnolias,"" stressing the importance of a strong female community rallying together for a good cause.

What We Need & What You Get
We're halfway there. But we need the extra push to make this film really shine. Getting the right look to make this film as candy sweet and beautiful as we can, recruiting a strong wardrobe and art department, hair and makeup, and authentic Southern locations.
We've already found our nanas that are going to bring the characters to life, and we need to make sure that we have enough funds to get this film through post-production (color correction, sound mixing, music composition) so we have the opportunity to submit to the best film festivals out there to get our film out for the world to see!
Kellie's Baking Co. has graciously given us the go-ahead to shoot in their gorgeous location in Austin. And they really do stand up to having the best chocolate chip cookies in Austin. Yum!

Have you ever wondered what goes into actually making a movie? Well, we plan on giving you an all-access pass into the behind the scenes making of the film and you'll be with us step-by-step through the process. 

The Impact
There are so many life lessons in this film.  The importance of friendship and sisterhood, the need for the legalization of medicinal marijuana for those in pain, the use of humor to get through those difficult times.  
This will be the fifth film I've produced, and this fun story gets me energized and excited to show the world how hilarious a bunch of Southern ladies can be.  Finding films that pass the Bechdel Test  are far and few between, and I'm proud to say this film passes it with flying colors.  Females talking only about men is so last century!
The last films I've done have sold to Netflix, Blockbuster, Amazon, and numerous retailers including Walmart and Best Buy. Having these established links and relationships with distributors will give it the best chance to get distributed for the world to see.  
Risks & Challenges

The good news is that we have a dedicated and experienced film crew that work within the Austin film industry lined up to make this a success. This film is raring to go and we are dedicated to making this the best possible film we can.  
Other Ways You Can Help

What makes us different from other Hollywood productions is that we're a modest crew who wants to make the best possible film we can.  We're so lucky to be in the great city of Austin, TX, where southern hospitality isn't just a saying, but a way of life!
If you're able to help us find food donations, (cast & crew get hungry after shooting 10-12 hour days), locations for these lovely ladies Southern homes, or just want to shadow and assist and help us on set make this dream a reality, there are plenty of ways you could help ""Nana's Secret Recipe"" come to life.

In the past decade, millions of families have fled their homes in search of peace, freedom and a brighter future. After escaping violence in their home countries, they face a treacherous journey to Europe and are often met with opposition, negative media attention, and a lack of resources waiting for them in their host countries. As media coverage has declined, and the story of the modern refugee has been twisted and warped, there are still millions of very real human beings living in fear and uncertainty but continuing to persevere and survive. </p><p>As this global issue becomes more eminent in the eyes of northern Europe and the Western World, the grassroots effort by smaller nonprofit organizations has grown exponentially in the past five years. The IRC states that the refugee population in Greece is approximately 62,000+ (over half of them being women and children). Much of the weight of supporting this crisis has been placed on a country that cannot even fully, economically support itself.</p><p> </p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1499896761/lwzt55qticiyzldhbfrp.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1500955471/wiwadzzhhblnqw9jiasj.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><h3> </h3><h3>T H E  F I L M </h3><p>During our team’s three week journey through Greece, we followed both refugees and volunteers as they shared their stories of pain, determination and faith. We heard harrowing stories of people crossing the deadly 4 mile stretch between Turkey and Greece, on their journey of escaping violence and war, in hopes of a better life in Europe. We heard stories of families living in camps finding ways to bring normalcy to their children’s lives, volunteers who had their faith in humanity tested and restored, and met with organizations that have found ingenious ways to address the most difficult problems facing refugees living in Europe.</p><p>The film will give audiences a look at the present situation in Athens, Lesvos and Thessaloniki and how each location's response to the influx of refugees varies from city-wide effects to local community levels. We take a look at all the incredible hard work being done in small settings, on the ground, from selfless volunteers across the world, and the ways they are working to foster healthier, brighter futures for refugees.</p><p>It happened organically that our team consisted entirely of women, and that during our time on the ground, we were met by an army of female volunteers and refugees working together to serve their communities. The film explores an underlying theme of the incredibly strong women on both sides of the crisis, a point of view that hasn't been given a lot of light.</p><p>We present the hopes volunteers and refugees have for both the future of the crisis, as well as their own lives. We seek to delve deep into the hearts of what drives these groups to continue on, and how women specifically, have put their lives on hold to help those in need, and have played a vital role in this world wide crisis. We aim to spark conversations and ideas addressing how any viewer of this film, old or young, man or woman, stateside or across the pond can use their skills and passions to bring solutions to the refugee crisis.</p><p>By examining what makes us different, we hope to also highlight what makes us the same, forging a connection between refugees and the global community and to ultimately cast a light on those who are frequently disregarded or forgotten.</p><h3> </h3><h3>W H A T  M A K E S  U S  D I F F E R E N T</h3><p>The refugee story is not new. Refugees have existed on almost every continent, since the dawn of civilization. The story has been covered in many ways, through many mediums, but in this moment, the world is lacking a critical piece to the existing refugee narrative.</p><p>Many people are familiar with stories of refugees fleeing violence, running through the night, piling into boats and embarking on the open sea to pursue a better life in Europe, but very little is known about what follows. Its pretty easy to assume that refugees are being taken care of. That there are systems in place to provide for them. Our team of eight women embarked on this journey to find out.</p><p>What we found is that refugees are still very much fighting for their survival. They are struggling to find meaning in their transient lives and to root themselves in their new countries. This new normal is not headline news, but is the creation of a new global community.</p><p>This new normal is refugee women stepping outside of their typical roles to become breadwinners, decision makers, and advocates for their families. This new normal is volunteers working to restore confidence and dignity to parents who haven’t been able to provide for their children. This new normal is European natives putting aside their bias to lend a hand to their Syrian, Iraqi, Pakistani, Eritrean, Nigerian, and Afghan neighbors.</p><p>This is the story that is currently unfolding in the social fabric of Greece and beyond. Our team seeks to bring this story to the forefronts of American culture, so we can better learn from our peers and apply these concepts to our daily life.</p><p> </p><h3>W H Y  W E   N E E D  Y O U R  H E L P </h3><p>The eight women who have dedicated their hearts and minds to the production of this film have done so because they truly believe in the importance of its message. In order to carry on their deeds, it is imperative that this film reaches its completion. After successfully reaching its field production wrap date, we are confident and carry positive presuppositions of the film’s completed version.</p><p>We’ve assembled a primed post-production team, but now need of your help to move forward with the film's completion. Your funding will assist in editing, scoring, sound design, animation, graphics, FX, contractual management and voice over. We understand making a film is an expensive process, however our team strongly believes in the art of storytelling, and that a story of great importance is meant to be told no matter the cost. This story is too important to keep to ourselves and we cannot wait to share what we have learned with the world.</p><p>We hope that you join our cause, become an advocate for ending the refugee crisis and become an ambassador of this film.</p><p>All donations made to this campaign will go directly to the post-production of 'Refugee Is Not My Name.'</p><p> </p><p style=""text-align: center;"">              <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1499896211/fdgcj33euho7mnzbkvdb.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: center;"">               <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1499896800/edacuvsd4iaq3taj57yp.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p> </p><h3>O U R  O R I G I N  S T O R Y</h3><p>The NPO: The Refugee Relief Project, founded by Megan Majd in 2016 was the the birth place of the documentary concept introduced by Rose Massett that would come to be known as 'Refugee Is Not My Name.’ In early 2016 Majd received the Davis Projects for Peace Grant. Our fellow crew member traveled to refugee camps in France and Greece where she interacted with hundreds of refugees.</p><p>The humanitarian effort provided resources to refugees in Europe and sought to raise awareness through filmmaking. Each dollar the project collected went directly to individuals, families, and volunteers at camps and squats around Greece.</p><p>Although efforts were and have been exerted to help those in need, our crew realized it was not enough. The world needed a sensory experience to understand the true magnitude of the refugee crisis.

Because we cared, and because it matters.</p><p>We have the backgrounds and the experience to make this documentary a full fledged reality. We are so incredibly close, but we need the support to make this dream finally come true. But even more so, we are the ones to make it happen, to share a story and a perspective never been seen before, because more than anything, we care. We have been there, we have met these people.

In the past decade, millions of families have fled their homes in search of peace, freedom and a brighter future. After escaping violence in their home countries, they face a treacherous journey to Europe and are often met with opposition, negative media attention, and a lack of resources waiting for them in their host countries. As media coverage has declined, and the story of the modern refugee has been twisted and warped, there are still millions of very real human beings living in fear and uncertainty but continuing to persevere and survive. As this global issue becomes more eminent in the eyes of northern Europe and the Western World, the grassroots effort by smaller nonprofit organizations has grown exponentially in the past five years. The IRC states that the refugee population in Greece is approximately 62,000+ (over half of them being women and children). Much of the weight of supporting this crisis has been placed on a country that cannot even fully, economically support itself.  T H E  F I L M During our team’s three week journey through Greece, we followed both refugees and volunteers as they shared their stories of pain, determination and faith. We heard harrowing stories of people crossing the deadly 4 mile stretch between Turkey and Greece, on their journey of escaping violence and war, in hopes of a better life in Europe. We heard stories of families living in camps finding ways to bring normalcy to their children’s lives, volunteers who had their faith in humanity tested and restored, and met with organizations that have found ingenious ways to address the most difficult problems facing refugees living in Europe.The film will give audiences a look at the present situation in Athens, Lesvos and Thessaloniki and how each location's response to the influx of refugees varies from city-wide effects to local community levels. We take a look at all the incredible hard work being done in small settings, on the ground, from selfless volunteers across the world, and the ways they are working to foster healthier, brighter futures for refugees.It happened organically that our team consisted entirely of women, and that during our time on the ground, we were met by an army of female volunteers and refugees working together to serve their communities. The film explores an underlying theme of the incredibly strong women on both sides of the crisis, a point of view that hasn't been given a lot of light.We present the hopes volunteers and refugees have for both the future of the crisis, as well as their own lives. We seek to delve deep into the hearts of what drives these groups to continue on, and how women specifically, have put their lives on hold to help those in need, and have played a vital role in this world wide crisis. We aim to spark conversations and ideas addressing how any viewer of this film, old or young, man or woman, stateside or across the pond can use their skills and passions to bring solutions to the refugee crisis.By examining what makes us different, we hope to also highlight what makes us the same, forging a connection between refugees and the global community and to ultimately cast a light on those who are frequently disregarded or forgotten. W H A T  M A K E S  U S  D I F F E R E N TThe refugee story is not new. Refugees have existed on almost every continent, since the dawn of civilization. The story has been covered in many ways, through many mediums, but in this moment, the world is lacking a critical piece to the existing refugee narrative.Many people are familiar with stories of refugees fleeing violence, running through the night, piling into boats and embarking on the open sea to pursue a better life in Europe, but very little is known about what follows. Its pretty easy to assume that refugees are being taken care of. That there are systems in place to provide for them. Our team of eight women embarked on this journey to find out.What we found is that refugees are still very much fighting for their survival. They are struggling to find meaning in their transient lives and to root themselves in their new countries. This new normal is not headline news, but is the creation of a new global community.This new normal is refugee women stepping outside of their typical roles to become breadwinners, decision makers, and advocates for their families. This new normal is volunteers working to restore confidence and dignity to parents who haven’t been able to provide for their children. This new normal is European natives putting aside their bias to lend a hand to their Syrian, Iraqi, Pakistani, Eritrean, Nigerian, and Afghan neighbors.This is the story that is currently unfolding in the social fabric of Greece and beyond. Our team seeks to bring this story to the forefronts of American culture, so we can better learn from our peers and apply these concepts to our daily life. W H Y  W E   N E E D  Y O U R  H E L P The eight women who have dedicated their hearts and minds to the production of this film have done so because they truly believe in the importance of its message. In order to carry on their deeds, it is imperative that this film reaches its completion. After successfully reaching its field production wrap date, we are confident and carry positive presuppositions of the film’s completed version.We’ve assembled a primed post-production team, but now need of your help to move forward with the film's completion. Your funding will assist in editing, scoring, sound design, animation, graphics, FX, contractual management and voice over. We understand making a film is an expensive process, however our team strongly believes in the art of storytelling, and that a story of great importance is meant to be told no matter the cost. This story is too important to keep to ourselves and we cannot wait to share what we have learned with the world.We hope that you join our cause, become an advocate for ending the refugee crisis and become an ambassador of this film.All donations made to this campaign will go directly to the post-production of 'Refugee Is Not My Name.'                               O U R  O R I G I N  S T O R YThe NPO: The Refugee Relief Project, founded by Megan Majd in 2016 was the the birth place of the documentary concept introduced by Rose Massett that would come to be known as 'Refugee Is Not My Name.’ In early 2016 Majd received the Davis Projects for Peace Grant. Our fellow crew member traveled to refugee camps in France and Greece where she interacted with hundreds of refugees.The humanitarian effort provided resources to refugees in Europe and sought to raise awareness through filmmaking. Each dollar the project collected went directly to individuals, families, and volunteers at camps and squats around Greece.Although efforts were and have been exerted to help those in need, our crew realized it was not enough. The world needed a sensory experience to understand the true magnitude of the refugee crisis. So therefore, in March 2017 our team of eight was assemble to give a voice to those that needed to be heard thousands of miles away.                O U R  T E A M We are filmmakers, artists, entrepreneurs, human rights advocates, producers, musicians, writers, students, healthcare consultants, composers, climate change leaders, engineers, community leaders, journalists and so much more. Each of us made a decision to go to Greece, to visit and help people who didn’t look like us, didn’t speak our language, didn’t practice the same faith, but we all went for one binding reason. Because we cared, and because it matters.We have the backgrounds and the experience to make this documentary a full fledged reality. We are so incredibly close, but we need the support to make this dream finally come true. But even more so, we are the ones to make it happen, to share a story and a perspective never been seen before, because more than anything, we care. We have been there, we have met these people. We have learned their names, shared meals with them and listened to their stories. Their strife became our inspiration, and we won’t stop until we’ve done right by them and ensured that their stories are told.Rose Massett (Director/ Producer / Writer / Director of Photography) is a graduate of New York University's Tisch School of the Arts, where she earned a degree in Film and Television production, with an emphasis on producing and ​entertainment business.

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Purpose and Impact</h3>
<p>Most refugees living in Athens are appreciative of the work of international volunteers, but it's not uncommon to hear some form of this sentiment:</p>
<p><strong>""If you really want to help, convince your government to accept more refugees.""</strong></p>
<p>Refugees are still trapped, detained, and ostracized in Europe, and aid organizations are limited in their ability fix this problem.  At some point, the keys are in the hands of our governments; and in order to convince our governments, we must work to sway public opinion in the right direction.  This is why we want to make this film. Not only to commit to memory the stories of so many people in anonymity, but to ultimately create tangible ways to help them, and allow them to help themselves.  </p>

<strong>Empowerment- </strong>We're dedicated to giving refugees tools that they can take with them wherever they go.  Our featured ""Sponsor"" perk is a chance to sponsor a refugee by funding a personal filmmaking course for them.  This course will culminate in a short film, written and directed by the sponsored person.  This gives the world a chance to hear from refugees directly, and it teaches a set of invaluable skills that can be used internationally.</li>

<strong>Ethics- </strong>Your support is crucial to making this documentary as ethically as possible.  Larger, more direct forms of funding often require revenue, which can lead to exploitative filmmaking.  Your donations will allow the filmmakers to approach this story with utmost sensitivity to the potential liabilities of the subjects, without monetary pressures from outside funders. We'll remain open in our intentions and steadfast in our resolve to ensure none of our subjects are exploited or misrepresented.</li>
<li><p style=""text-align: left;""><strong>Experience- </strong>Building trust is not easy. You can't just walk up to someone as ask if you can tell their story.

Most refugees living in Athens are appreciative of the work of international volunteers, but it's not uncommon to hear some form of this sentiment:
""If you really want to help, convince your government to accept more refugees.""
Refugees are still trapped, detained, and ostracized in Europe, and aid organizations are limited in their ability fix this problem.  At some point, the keys are in the hands of our governments; and in order to convince our governments, we must work to sway public opinion in the right direction.  This is why we want to make this film. Not only to commit to memory the stories of so many people in anonymity, but to ultimately create tangible ways to help them, and allow them to help themselves.  



A short piece from the filmmakers, using some preliminary footage shot by Alex during his work in Athens.

This Isn't A Typical Documentary

Your donations don't merely fund a film; they support a process of filmmaking that is imperative, yet rare in this genre.


Empowerment- We're dedicated to giving refugees tools that they can take with them wherever they go.  Our featured ""Sponsor"" perk is a chance to sponsor a refugee by funding a personal filmmaking course for them.  This course will culminate in a short film, written and directed by the sponsored person.  This gives the world a chance to hear from refugees directly, and it teaches a set of invaluable skills that can be used internationally.

Ethics- Your support is crucial to making this documentary as ethically as possible.  Larger, more direct forms of funding often require revenue, which can lead to exploitative filmmaking.  Your donations will allow the filmmakers to approach this story with utmost sensitivity to the potential liabilities of the subjects, without monetary pressures from outside funders. We'll remain open in our intentions and steadfast in our resolve to ensure none of our subjects are exploited or misrepresented.
Experience- Building trust is not easy. You can't just walk up to someone as ask if you can tell their story. That person has to believe in what you're doing and want to help you do it.  After months working in Athens, Alex has a personal connection with people and places which will enrich this film and turn it into the dynamic piece we know it can be.



Who Are The Filmmakers?
Not only do we think there is a story to be told, but after months of first-hand experience and contextual research, we think we're the ones to go and tell it.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hi Everyone! I truly appreciate you guys taking the time to see what I’m up to next. As you can see, after having great success with my first film...due to the love and support from you guys, I was motivated to do another. I'm excited about this one because it's a documentary about the obsession people have on social media with the <strong>filters</strong> and photo enhancements apps.</p>
<h3><strong>Why I need your support </strong></h3>
</div><div>
<p>As an independent writer and director, I'm working on a very tight budget. I shot this film on little to no budget at all. I wanted to be a little creative, so I filmed 70% of the film on my iphone7...which cost me nothing. I am now done filming and need a little help with editing/post production (USD $2, 500). Which is the most important part of a film project.  </p>
<p>Your contribution will help pay for  post-production.  Be well assured that every contributed dollar will only be used for the completion of this film. I’m very passionate about this project and I can’t wait to share it with all of you.</p>

<h3>Story</h3>
<p>I read Raymond Carver's short story ""Why Don't You Dance?"" a year ago and ever since, I haven't been able to get it out of my head. It tells a story that strikes many of its readers because of its blatant lack of exposition or explanation for the strange environment it throws its readers into - an unusual yard sale hosted by a mysterious and solemn middle-aged man. In the story, a young couple attend this yard sale and the three characters share an oddly intimate experience on this lawn filled with all of the man's possessions and memories. In the end, the three characters go their separate ways and we, the onlookers, are left to ponder this strange and beautiful encounter. </p>
<p>This eerie departure from a traditional narrative setup rings a kind of truth that we hope to replicate in our film — that life doesn’t come with plot points and that ambiguity is often more beautiful than explanation. In the absence of a traditional narrative setup, we hope to provide our audience with a fundamentally emotional experience that plays with their expectations, rather than plays out narrative conventions.</p>
<p>""Not For Sale"" is an experimental film which follows its main character, Jack, a man in his mid-50's who has recently lost his wife. He hosts a yard sale in order to rid himself of all of his worldly possessions that are stained with her memory. A young couple, Henry and Sarah, attend Jack's sale and are forced to encounter the fact that Jack's memories have a way of creeping into their reality.</p>
<h3>Our Production</h3>
<p>This is Julia's junior year thesis at NYU's Tisch School of the Arts. She has assembled a crew of fellow student filmmakers who have agreed to help her bring her project to life. The production team is currently in the midst of preparing for their mid-November shoot when our team of 17 will travel to Connecticut for 2 days of principle photography. After 2-3 months of post production, we will submit our final product to festivals around the country and post the film online in late 2018.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Budget Breakdown</h3>
<p>Filmmaking is an incredible and collaborative art form, but it is also a very expensive one. In order to make this project happen, we are hoping to raise $4,500 that will cover our crucial production costs.</p>

Rolling In The Deep: A Crime Drama that follows the life of Marcus Washington, An African American Male who served in the United States Armed Forces as a member of the 761st Tank Battalion(Black Panthers) who travels back home to South Carolina after the war.
Marcus has one agenda on his mind and that's to achieve a dream of his late Father Earl, eating a meal at a locally famous Whites Only Diner.
This film sheds light on a major part of African American history often overlooked and seldom mentioned. This is done through a Father and Son, who put their lives on the line for this country during WW1 then WW2 as part of two unknown but significantly important combat regiments, the Harlem Hellfighters & General Patton's 761st Tank Battalion. Once the war is over a new story begins as these combat vets test how far ones love will go to achieve a dream while defending the honor of a fellow Soldier, Father and American.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Three soldiers, Bobby, Michael and Will, are walking through the jungle in Vietnam when Bobby hears a click. He stepped on a mine. Will goes to work on the mine to disarm it while Michael takes a knees and keeps an eye out for enemies. Bobby remains still and begins to talk with Michael to sooth his nerves. Eventually, Bobby settles on a memory and recounts the time he was on a hot streak playing craps at a small bar in Texas.</p>
<p>The bar was crowded and the alley they played craps in was full. Bobby was winning everything and shouted he could beat the devil if he were there. Thats when he appeared. He walked in and challenged Bobby, taking everything he had. On the last roll, Bobby played for his soul and prays. He won. But the devil, now upset, tells Bobby he will revisit him in exactly one year from that day. June 24. Bobby goes on to explain that in that year, he was drafted and survived in countless battles leading up to today. The days blurred together and he lost track of time. That’s when Bobby, now on the mine, asks Michael what the day is. Michael then responds with “It’s June 24.”</p>

<p>My name is Chris Matrone, I'm an award winning filmmaker and the Writer  &amp; Director of 5 Doors. The film 5 Doors touches on subject matters that are extremely relevant to the times of today, yesterday, and tomorrow. The film discusses depression, suicide, forgotten ambitions, and the existential crisis we all face as go through our lives trying to make a name for ourselves and leave our mark in history.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Location fees, sets, &amp; permits: Renting locations, building sets, and get permission to shoot in certain locations (permits). I'm not against breaking and entering, but not everyone is as cool as me.</p>
<p>Insurance: In case one of our actors or crew gets lost on this spiritual journey and we need to hire a rescue party.</p>
<p>Wardrobe: The clothes just don't make the man/woman/child/alien, it makes the movie!     </p>
<p>Makeup and Special effects makeup: The price of makeup adds up, and our makeup artists got to eat too. </p>
<p>Post Production (sound mix, score, editing, etc.): Just because the curtain has closed, doesn't mean the show is over. The film's adventure never stops, as such the expenses for the film never ends as well.</p>
<p>Storage Drives: The raw footage has to sleep somewhere before it's turned into magic! </p>
<p>Catering: The Cast and Crew would like to eat. While some of us can just rough it out days on end without food or water, some have enjoyed the finer things in life like having a full stomach after a hards day work. </p>
<p>Film Festival Submissions: The expenses for a film never stop, even after filing and editing. To make sure this film's story is properly told, it's going to have to hit the festival circuit hard, and as any filmmaker can tell you, those festival submissions all start to add up.  </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This film was all about how life can affect us, and sometimes it feels like there is nowhere to go, so we run away. I was inspired to tell a story that I thought could speak to people dealing with the feelings of stress, depression, and suicide, especially with today's problems in society.  We often ignore these feelings or suppress them. Other times we see the warning signs, but we ignore the unfortunate truth, for a comforting lie. Regardless of our best efforts, everyone sometimes feels like we are ice skating uphill to an uncacheable goal. Other times we achieve our goals, yet we feel overwhelmed like we are flying too close to the sun like Icarus and find ourselves lost in the flames of our ambition. </p>
<p>5 Doors starts out as a seemingly mundane and simple story that turns into a spiritual quest of redemption, self-realization, and the acceptance of one’s mortality.The biggest theme in this film is that second chances are possible, even if the second chances come at the very end of our journey. The films asks the question “Are you happy?” and if not, “What is happiness to you?”.  The message in this film is that It’s okay not to be okay, and you are never alone. Some people never learn that, and that is something that deserves to be changed. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Let me start off by saying that even if this campaign doesn't raise a penny, this film will happen. Regardless of this film being a passion project of mine, I firmly believe that the message behind this film is something everyone should hear. Suicide, depression, apathy towards life, these are feelings that everyone has felt. I know I've felt it. I wrote this film as an outlet for my own depression and thoughts of suicide. I was once told to take my pain and make it art, so that's what I did.</p>
<p>The beauty about Indiegogo is that it's flexible and every dollar we earn we can put it towards the film. Anything from a dollar helps this production be even better, and everyone behind it is more than grateful to anyone who donates, invests, supports, or just helps spread the word. </p>

</ul></div>","AN IMPORTANT STORY TO BE TOLD, NOWIn a small town in Southern India, when Kartik, a young gay man, comes out to his conservative mother Vasudha, she has no one to turn to dispel her own fears and self doubts, and understand her loving son’s truth. She has to find her own ways to deal with her intolerant husband Damodar and the unforgiving traditional society around her. ‘Evening Shadows (Surmaee Shaam)’ is a universal story about a mother-son bond and its emotional strength to withstand the ravages of time and the harsh realities of our society. WHERE WE STAND NOWShooting for the film has been completed and post-production has been completed till edit lock. Background score and audio post production (dialogue clean-up, foley, sound effects) are in progress, but stalled due to paucity of funds. Color grading, VFX, credits and subtitling have to begin.We need your support to make this film happen. WHAT IS THE FILM’S USP:
The film has been shot in exquisite locales in Southern India, which adds a new dimension – not only being evocative, but also rich in visual and aural subtexts, metaphors and symbols.
The film has been conceived, written and produced by award winning team at Solaris Pictures - Sridhar Rangayan (director, producer, writer) and Saagar Gupta (creative director, writer, producer, lyricist) who have to their credit several acclaimed LGBTQ films (Pink Mirror, Yours Emotionally, 68 Pages, Purple Skies, Breaking Free)
The film’s lead actors Ananth Mahadevan and Mona Ambegaonkar are veterans with years of experience and greatly respected by audiences across India. The film’s young lead Devansh Doshi and Arpit Chaudhary are bright actors who hold a great promise for future.
The composer of the title song Shubha Mudgal is a very renowned singer who is very popular.
The crew boasts of accomplished professionals with mainstream, acclaimed film credits: DOP - Subhransu Das (Poorna, Filmistaan), Editor - Pravin Angre (B.A.Pass, Shagird, Ahista Ahista, Breaking Free - National Award winner), Sound Design - Madhu Apsara (Badlapur, Stanley Ka Dabba, Johnny Gaddar - Filmfare Award winner)
The film’s trailer released in May has gone viral with around 50000 views on Facebook and 9000+ views on YouTube

The film has already received a good media coverage. Check news links HERE

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>I've acted and shot films throughout my life, and trained in production and screenwriting at the University of Michigan, where I made a thesis film, ""The Leaders and the Rest"" (Ann Arbor is almost as great as Manhattan).  After graduating, I shot a feature-length web series, ""The Year of the Phoenix,"" which is available on YouTube.  I also worked at a post-production facility in SoHo (ironically, in the same building where my parents met in 1982).</p>
<p>Then, I took a break from production to focus on my acting.  I've performed in plays and short films throughout NJ and NYC, and founded a nonprofit theater company dedicated to diversity, Dragonfly Multicultural Arts Center, with my mom.</p>
<p>Now I'm ready to get back to my love of production with this idea that's been on my mind for about five years.  But I want to do this the right way in order to create the best possible film, and that means:</p>
<ul>
<li>renting a high-end camera (in our case, a Blackmagic)</li>
<li>renting or buying sound equipment</li>
<li>renting lighting equipment</li>
<li>paying crew</li>
<li>keeping cast and crew well-fed</li>
<li>paying rental fees for some authentic NYC locations</li>
<li>art-directing and purchasing costumes to create a true early-'80s look</li>
</ul>
<p>Our current cast includes Shauni Ramai, Nathaniel Tomb, and Aaron Ogle.  Our current crew includes Katie Nahvi and Matt Levy (with lots more TBA!).</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<ul>
<li>Most of our funding will go toward renting a Blackmagic kit and some attendant lighting and paying our crew, who are NYC-based professionals</li>
<li>We also plan to rent a specific club that was around in the '80s; an abandoned luncheonette run by an art collective; and giving a small fee to a NYC native with an apartment where we want to film</li>
<li>We want you to feel like part of our team!  That's what our perks are geared toward.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<ul>
<li>Our crew are all hardworking, NYC-based professionals.</li>
<li>Our cast is diverse and the script tells stories beyond that of our millennial protagonist.</li>
<li>All locations are in the five boroughs, and we want to spotlight the experiences of New Yorkers, beyond the typical Midtown/FiDi gloss.</li>
<li>I previously shot a feature-length webseries (""The Year of the Phoenix"") on only $3K, so imagine what we can do with this!</li>
<li>As both an actor and a director (with an AD keeping an eye on things!), I'm dedicated to creating an efficient, safe, fun shoot for our cast and crew.  And I'll keep everyone well-fed!</li>
</ul>
<h3>Challenges</h3>
</div><div><ul>
<li>NYC is expensive, and no doubt we'll run into unexpected challenges and expenses along the way.  But I come from a run-and-gun filmmaking background, and like to look for creative, efficient, and--where possible--cheap ways to solve problems.</li>

The more experience we gain in producing our original works, the more work we can share out there with the world. This film specifically is intended to become a feature film in the future. The better the results we achieve now, the better our chances will be to have the support we will need for the feature. For each one of us it's a matter of shaping our careers and our individual styles. what do we need the funds for?Mostly for these 4 reasons:1. Cast/ Talents- we as actors believe that actors should get paid. There is nothing more frustrating than working really hard and not be rewarded for that. In general- more money at this front means more options for casting. 2. Logistics and Equipment- we have most of the equipment needed for the production. However there will be several outdoor location in this production that require an addition of equipment, and a preparation in terms of transporting gear and manpower. 3. Sets: there will be two sets that we will have to either build fully, or transform a location into- one of them is of a clinic where Leo has his sessions, and the other is of a cave in which we find prehistorical evidences for the Marbles. 4. Special Effects: The creation of an animated characters and other effects will increase the cost of post production, and require a specific gear such as green screen.  international networkingDirector Tsuk Ben Zvi and producer Nicole Feinholz are graduates of the Vancouver Film School (VFS) in Vancouver, Canada. While shooting in Israel, advance editing and other post production elements will occur in Vancouver by other graduates of the school. Members of the cast and crew are of different nationalities. We hope that some of you from different countries will donate money, and later the film will be viewed world wide, and international networking with filmmakers and audiences will be made.We hope to inspire filmmakers all around the work to create their original art.   creditsAnyone donating 70$ or more will get a ""Special Thanks"" credit.Anyone donating 500$ or more will get an Executive producer credit.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Who I am</h3>
<p>I'm Scott Danzig, a computer programmer, who lives and breathes filmmaking in every spare moment I get.  I believe in my creativity and technical chops, and have proven time and time again that I can make films people love.  It's not easy, and it always feels like I'm building a house of cards, but I found that by partnering with the right collaborators, and by simply refusing to give up, that house gets built, every time. Visit <a href=""http://www.sneakyghost.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.sneakyghost.com</a> to see some of my work.</p>
<p>I don't do this for a day job. I hope to one day, but for now, it's been largely out of pocket. I'm running a crowdfunding campaign for this next film because I need the community behind me to keep going. I've gotten enthusiastic responses to my efforts, and I want to let fans of my work be a part of my crazy filmmaking adventures as I create more films that you can be proud of.</p>
<h3>The film</h3>
<p>Toddler Tartare is my attempt to be comfortable making uncomfortable art. It was certainly awkward applying for a grant for this! However, I love absurdist humor, and a cannibalistic restaurant certainly lends to that, but -- there are deeper layers. The restaurant serves as a metaphor for our world. Those we love are in this world with us in our dark times. We each decide for ourselves how we cope and what we prioritize.</p>
<p>Also, to improve my directing, I signed up for acting classes at the Actors' Workshop of Ithaca and not only did I learn a lot and make a bunch of great friends, but I also roped in three more awesome actors to add to my talented cast.</p>

<p>I love actors and am very excited to work again with all of them!</p>
<h3>How I'll use your money</h3>
<p>I'm asking for $2,000 to help make this film happen.  First, I need it for props, like fake yet convincing knives and body parts. Here are some I already purchased.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1499994233/acamsdkozb4deso7zctx.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Also, there's set design, such as tablecloths, and things, including prepared food, on the restaurant's tables for various scenes.  For wardrobe we need outfits for the restaurant staff, and some accessories for the cast.  People in film need to eat.  Here's how much food was left over after a long day on my last shoot:</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1499995306/npsvdxlloutshfumqrba.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Also, I always need supplies like gaffers tape, black wrap, new bulbs, batteries, new gels. I'll have to cover transportation expenses as necessary too.  And the mansion has particular lighting needs.  I've already bought a powerful Rayzr 7 LED fresnel light for over $1500, but need ""modifiers"" that help me make the light look more natural and pleasing.  Specifically, I'll need a ""scrim kit"" plus another C-stand.  Then, of course, post production, which likely will include special effects work, music, and sound editing.</p>
<h3>If I don't reach my goal</h3>
<p>I spend a lot of my own money on good equipment, which is why I don't have to ask for a lot, but I can't sustain shouldering the entire financial burden. If I don't reach my crowdfunding goal, I've put too much work into this film to not see it through, and will pull out credit cards if necessary, but I will have difficulty starting the next.</p>

<p>Binghamton, NY, while still economically recovering, has a vibrant theater, music, and art scene, and has been hungry to embrace filmmaking. On my last shoot, despite a raging blizzard, everyone, even the extras all showed up. They're true professionals that deserve opportunities!</p>
<h3>Risks</h3>
<p>The main risk for this film is the time we're allowed to film in the mansion.  Three six hour days.  I've been working hard on the shot list with planning, with shot lists and overhead diagrams, figuring out what shots are necessary, what can be combined, and, for the first time in my filmmaking career, I'm going to embrace greenscreening for every shot possible.  I managed to whittle down the number of shots we need to a manageable number, and have leaned on the advice of others for how to best light the set quickly. A lot of good collaborators are volunteering to help out, so I'm starting to feel confident.</p>
<h3>Help my movies find an audience</h3>
<p>In addition to funding, I also encourage you to spread the word about this project.  My pitch video, despite how silly it seems, deserves to be shared! I'm sure the baby that I used for this promo will be proud of her part in this project when she grows up, but you can show your pride now!  IndieGoGo provides share tools to help.

Synopsis
Thomas Mallory is a big-city detective, demoted to a
small town after a series of scandalous incidents. He needs to solve a big case
to earn his way home. A dead college student starts Mallory on an
investigation that uncovers a centuries-old society of killers now dwelling in
this small college-town. Mallory, always one step behind the bad guys, must
expose and stop the murderers before he becomes the next victim, or
killer.  
On THEME and GENREWatch Me is a film noir about the battle between the temptation to do wrong, and the desire to do right.  Noir, as a genre, is darker both visually and tonally, and allows us to more freely explore the darker sides of the human condition.  Classic noir's include The Big Sleep, The Maltese Falcon, and more recently L.A. Confidential, and Se7en.  Yet there is more to a film's story than just the movie's on-screen story.  PROJECT HISTORYWatch Me's script started in a Studio City cloffice (that's a closet/office) and was refined in Athens, GA.  At the suggestion of his wife, writer/director Brian Armes sent the script to her school classmate, Heather Shisler for consideration as the femme fatale, Vicki Wellington.  Ms. Shisler, a recent graduate of the Actor's Studio Drama School is joined by her fellow alumnus Dan Kellmer and Athens's own Brittani Bumb to round out the principal cast.  Behind the camera, Watch Me will be directed by writer/director Brian Armes, an alumnus of the American Film Institute Conservatory and lecturer of Film and Digital Media at the University of North Georgia.  Joining him is cinematographer Tim Kang, a graduate of the American Film Institute Conservatory's prestigious Cinematography program.  Production Design will be helmed by Karen Ipock, a native of the Southeast.  The film will also feature the music of Seoul-based American-Korean punk band ...Whatever That Means (links and photos are below). The team is eager to introduce our growing audience to this project and ask for your support in making this film a reality.  We are here on this site seeking seed money to ensure a minimum funding for production. THE PLAN Production is scheduled to start in Athens, GA, on July 7, 2016.  Much of our crew, key equipment, and some
supporting cast will be coming from the University of North Georgia's Department of Communication, Media, and Journalism.  Through this project, these students will have the unique opportunity for hands-on production experience, under the leadership of trained Los Angeles-based filmmakers, that will supplement their classroom education.  This start date allows a complete production window before the start of the fall school semester.  
Post-production will continue in the fall, based out of Los Angeles.  Upon completion in spring of 2017, plans for Watch Me include a celebration tour where we will share the fruits of our labors with our backers in a series of road-shows, a season on the festival circuit where we will continue to grow our audience of cinephiles, and finally, a journey into distribution where audiences may have an opportunity to experience our film in theatrical and video-on-demand platforms. But none of that will be possible without a funded and supported production.

WHAT WE NEED & WHAT YOU GET
The production needs $36,000 to fund travel, compensation, and
housing for our attached elements.  Additional funds are also needed for production essentials: 
crew 
- because we need people to make a moviecast – because we need people to be in the
moviefood – because cast and crew need to eatequipment – because we need materials to shoot
the filmlocations – because we need places to be when
shooting the filmprops and set pieces – because actors need to
hold stuffand insurance – because . . . well, let’s not
talk about those things.
Check out the incentives on this site.  Contributors of any amount will be invited
to regional backers-only screening events once the film is completed.  Other contributors can receive
exclusive access to behind-the-scenes information, content, and experiences
like set visits, meals with the filmmakers, pre-screening mixers, and even parts in
the film!  We feel there is no
better way to thank our partners than making you all a part of this experience.
While we have lofty goals in this campaign, and have posted a $36,000 goal, any funds pledged will go toward the
production of this film. 

THIS SHOW'S IMPACT
The Armes Movie Factory, a Georgia-based film development and production company, aims to produce feature films honoring classic film genres and Hollywood filmmaking techniques.  Projects are planned for production in 2018 and 2020, and their success will be shaped by the success of Watch Me.  Coupled with passions for local storytelling and education, emphasis will be given toward employing younger Georgians, fresh from college and graduate programs, and producing these projects in their ""backyard.""  We believe this will help and equip them in acquiring skills of professionalism and an understanding of film industry best-practices and standards.  From there, the sky will be the limit for these storytellers and the stories they will tell.

Trump says adios to respect. Trump says adios to diversity.
Trump say adios to a  united country. But we say hello to the idea of having a
land where everyone fits in. A land where diversity makes us greater. 

Based on that dream was born Crusade in Wonderland, a short film that tells the story of an immigrant family. Martina, an 8 year old
girl who was born in Wonderland to undocumented parents. Lupita, the older sister came to Wonderland as a small girl. Their father was deported to Mexico after having been caught working without documents in the kitchen of a fancy restaurant. 
Rosa, the girls mother, and Don Choco, the grandfather, are raising the sisters and doing a great job despite the complexity of their circumstances. But in Wonderland, the malicious speech of the clowns who want to rule the placepromotes division and creates an atmosphere of hatred that damages the relations among neighbors.



For this project a group of artists from United States, Syria, Colombia, Dominican Republic, Pakistan, Ecuador, Venezuela, Poland, Haiti, Philippines,  have join to work together. We believe in film making as a way to reflect and question realities, we aim to tell stories that entertain but also affect our communities in a positive way.

<p><b>Who are we?</b></p>
<p>Kibanda Pictures is a local Film Production company with a mission to tell Kenyan stories the Kenyan way. Last year, we participated in a short film challenge dubbed the 48 hour Film Project which is a competition which focuses on the development of short films (start to finish) within 48 hours. <a href=""http://www.48hourfilm.com/how-it-works"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.48hourfilm.com/how-it-works</a></p>
<p></p>
<p>We developed a 7 minute long short film titled ‘Bait’ for the project and won six awards including Best Short film and Audience Choice Award. In addition to winning at the 48hr Film Project, ‘Bait’ represented Kenya at the Filmapalooza Festival in Atlanta and was shortlisted among the top 15 short Films from across the globe to be featured at the Cannes Film Festival –short films corner- between the 16th May and 22nd May 2016. <a href=""http://www.48hourfilm.com/home"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.48hourfilm.com/home</a></p>
<p>Other accolades won by ‘Bait’ include:</p>
<p>? 2016 Best Short Film at the Riverwood awards.</p>
<p>? Best Script<br/></p>
<p>? Best Actress</p>
<p>? Best Supporting Actress</p>
<p>Kibanda Pictures would love to get our award winning Director (Likarion Wainaina) and our celebrated Writer (Brian Munene) to the 2016 Cannes Film Festival. Their physical presence at the festival is crucial because:</p>
<p>? It would be a show of support for our local talent and local productions.</p>
<p>? It’s not every day that local productions get showcased abroad…this is a feat that needs representatives and who’s better suited other than the brainchild behind ‘Bait’?</p>
<p>? The Festival provides an opportunity for Kenya to be recognized on International platforms as a film destination and a potential key player in the Film Industry</p>
<p>? Give Likarion and Brian an opportunity to benchmark and interact with industry players from diverse places and backgrounds</p>
<p><b>Where/how do you come in?</b></p>
<p>We cannot afford (financially) to send Likarion and Brian to France. So, we are looking for support in either cash or kind to ensure that they get to France by the 16th of May. We therefore appeal for any form of support from you towards this noble cause. Whatever support you will give us will go towards catering for:</p>
<p>1. Return Air Tickets to France (2 pax)</p>
<p>2. Accommodation</p>
<p>3. Visa Application Fees</p>
<p>4. Upkeep while in France</p>
<br/><p><b>We are in love with what we do and really want to go to France but we cannot make this happen without your help.</b></p>

<h3>The Journey to Space Journey</h3>
<div>Space Journey first came to be fifteen years ago when a young Benjamin Blue wrote a short script about four ridiculous characters in their ridiculously humongous spaceship. Since then, many things have changed, including the introduction and popularization of the web show, which presented itself as the opportune platform to share Space Journey with the world. </div>
<div>Ben convinced a few of his film school comrades to join him on this crazy venture, which grew into a cast and crew of twenty five crazies ready to make Space Journey a reality. Thus, our proof of concept pilot episode. We really want to make Space Journey professional quality entertainment with great sets and eye-popping effects, so we brought it to IndieGoGo to gain momentum to shoot the first four episodes, which complete a story arc. </div>
<div>We've all grown to love and embrace Space Journey, even those of us who aren't sci-fi or Star Trek enthusiasts. These characters and stories are full of hilarity, adventure, and plenty of reverent satire. If you like what you see and contribute to Space Journey you are helping us create a new and colorful world to share with the real one. We firmly believe comedy is essential to living, and laughing essential to sanity. Help us keep the world sane by allowing us to share the insanity of Space Journey!</div> </div> <div> <h3></h3>
<p><span style=""font-size: 24px;letter-spacing: 0px;line-height: 30px;background-color: initial;"">The Effects of Your Efforts</span></p>
<div>We are looking to raise $150,000 for the first four episodes here on IndieGoGo. This will be crucial to lease a space big enough for all our necessary set construction including the bridge, halls, and dining quarters of the USS Abnormalinsize. As you can infer from the name, this spaceship is HUGE, and the sets need to match. We also want to bring back the amazing cast and crew, plus some, at industry standard rates for a professional shoot. </div>
<div>Here's a little insight to the cost breakdown we're looking at. A small portion will help pay off our loan used to shoot the pilot, a larger portion to the actual production of the first four episodes, and the largest to pre-production. </div>

<div>In exchange for supporting Space Fleet (us) we are offering some exclusive and unique Space Journey rewards for you to enjoy! These range from a special Space Journey patch to show off around town, to a T-shirt designed by our own stunt coordinator (he's multitalented), to a Supporting Producer credit for one or more episodes of the show. You can also get a poster signed by the series cast members including a Mighty Morphin Power Ranger! </div>
<div>Even if we are unable to raise the desired amount here on IndieGoGo, your contributions will still go toward Space Journey, and only Space Journey. First and foremost we will be paying back our loan and acquiring the studio space mentioned above, then stretching your support as far as we can in design and set construction while looking for other means of funding to shoot the episodes if need be. </div>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Deep Impact</h3>
<div>For far too long independent science fiction has been dominated by the pensive and morose, but Space Journey shall finally loose sci-fi from the angsty shackles of futurism so that it can frolic across the starry meadows of hope and bring laughter to tiny children (and grown up children) as it was meant to. </div>

<div>This campaign is specifically for the first four episodes. The first season alone has sixteen episodes total and we have three seasons of the show outlined and raring to come alive. So this is merely the beginning. </div>
<div>Obviously, to shoot the entire season the way we desire to we will need oodles of money. Once we have the four professional, polished, and hilarious first episodes we will be looking into other means of fundraising as well as IndieGoGo, like shooting our own commercials for products and companies willing to help us out and gain some marketing. </div>
<div>There is, of course, the constant risk of ultimate failure and demise, but we believe in Space Journey and its appeal to the masses. So we shall fly on and fight for what we know to be good and true silly sci-fi spectacle, while humbly asking for your support in this endeavor. </div>

<p><i style=""font-weight: bold;"">DEPARTURE </i>is a science fiction/horror short film that follows a mother and scientist, Lisa Abram, who is still grieving and blaming herself for the accidental death of her son. We join her as she prepares to embark on the first manned mission to a parallel universe. As a result of the immense sense of guilt and unbearable depression she's been struggling with since the death of her son five years previously, Lisa has convinced herself that this parallel universe has to be the afterlife, hoping that maybe she might be able to see her son again.</p>
<p> In this film, we pick up on the morning of the mission, closely following Lisa from the time she wakes up after seeing her son die in a horrible recurring nightmare, to when she and her team arrive in the parallel universe. There, they are attacked by an enormous, grotesque flying creature mere moments after their arrival. </p>

While I'm putting a lot of my own resources into it, it's still not enough, which is why we've opted to ask you, Indiegogoers, for help. Your donations will help pay for many things necessary for this project's success such as- <br/></p>
<p>- COSTUMES: Building three awesome looking spacesuit-type costumes isn't going to be cheap or easy, but who would want to see people travel to a parallel universe in normal clothing? <br/></p>
<p>- THE PHILADELPHIA SET: When our three scientists travel to another world, they board a large, heavily modified and re-purposed Apollo capsule named the Philadelphia. This is what carries them to the parallel universe. While some of the exterior shots of this will be of a model composite, done in post production, we still need to build the interior of the ship. <br/></p>
<p>- GEAR: As a student at Cuyahoga Community College I have access to a ton of great equipment to use during production, free of charge. But given the nature of the way we want to shoot this project, there are still a few things that are going to need to be rented, such as a wireless follow focus system, and wireless video transmitter. <br/></p>
<p>- PROPS AND SET DRESSING: In order to make the world that <i><b>DEPARTURE</b></i> takes place in as immersive as possible, we will be needing to buy props and other items to make each and every scene look as amazing and real as it can be. <br/></p>
<p>- VISUAL EFFECTS: Everything you see that we can't do on set, we're going to need to pay a visual effects artist for. Things like the enormous monster at the end of the film will need to be modeled, animated and composited in post-production, and all of that is VERY expensive, but with a visual-heavy project such as this, it's a necessity. <br/></p>

</div></div>","SET, a hired Killer who makes a deadly mistake, finds herself in a cat and mouse chase with the most murderous men in the country as she battles for her life to make it all right again.  
Filming is underway, and the finish line is in sight!   

The filming has already begun! Back in November of 2015 we ran the very first Indiegogo campaign for the film and with the grace of our friends and family we came away with close to half of what we were asking for!

  Where some filmmakers might try to push for more funding, we decided to take action. 



Instead of trying to fill out the budget then, we decided to show you all what you were buying into, so we took what what small budget we had and started making the movie. 

With a team of dedicated crew and a killer cast, we ran off to Phoenix, Arizona and began the production literally from the moment we drove out. 

Now that the first half of production is complete, with the finish line clearly in site, we only have FOUR more days of production left to shoot! So, to make this possible with the most efficient and effective means, we decided to try for one final Indiegogo run! 
But this time, we've got so much more to show you : )  

(The whole team in a Junkyard gets ready for an intense choreographed sequence between Lead Actress Dorée Seay and the Freelance Killer played by Jax Menez)   

(Shooting night sequences in downtown Phoenix, Lead Actress Dorée Seay establishes dominance over a dangerous man played by Az Actor A. Calion Maston) 


(Sitting down with Lead Actress Dorée Seay as we go over blocking for the scene)

(Lead Make up Artist Brooke Darwin working her magic on Dorée Seay's face before a heavy post-battle scene)

Meet some of the bad guys 


Chris Labadie as 'Samuel', a quirky good natured introvert who reaches out to help 'SET' and finds himself tangled in a very dangerous and violent web. 


Maryam Cné as 'Dana', overly protective loving sister to 'Samuel' who will do anything to keep her brother safe and the deadly 'SET' at arms length, despite 'Samuel's' good intentions. 


Dorée Seay as 'SET' , A hired Killer who makes a deadly mistake and enters into a cat and mouse chase with the most murderous men in the country as she fights to make it all right again.  



Harrison Page plays 'Karl; The Owner' The only thing more dangerous than a killer is the man who owns the killers, and Karl owns the entire west coast. A partitioner of freelance murder gigs, Karl is the man behind the curtain that sicks the world on 'Set's' heels, despite being the man who first took her in from the streets.

</div></div>","Bref résumé
SPORTWIZME.com est un tout nouveau site internet vous permettant de trouver tous les sportifs près de chez vous en quelques clics.Le sport tout seul, c'est bien... à plusieurs, c'est mieux !Il vous est possible de géo-localiser les sportifs inscrits, et de filtrer les différents profils par:
sport
niveau
disponibilité horaires
Ensuite, il ne vous reste plus qu'à contacter les sportifs qui correspondent à votre pratique via notre messagerie interne.Et hop, on chausse les baskets et on va faire du sport ensemble !
L'idée de ce site est venue tout simplement...""Après un déménagement (changement de région), moi qui pratiquait beaucoup de sport, le tennis notamment, il m'a été très compliqué de trouver de nouveaux partenaires avec qui jouer. Hier, c'était encore un problème, plus maintenant grâce à SPORTWIZME ! "" Jean-Sébastien Volpé, Co-fondateur de SPORTWIZME.com


Ce dont nous avons besoin et ce que vous obtenezAujourd'hui, le plus important pour nous est d'enrichir notre communauté et d'avoir le plus de sportifs inscrits sur notre site internet !Cela tombe bien, cela ne vous coûte rien, seulement 2 minutes de votre temps ! :)Si toutefois votre générosité l'emportait... nous sommes à la recherche de financement pour nous aider à mieux communiquer autour de notre site internet.Qui dit participation dit contrepartie (et c'est bien normal), c'est pourquoi en fonction du montant de votre participation, vous bénéficierez d'équipement sportif aux couleurs de SPORTWIZME, car vous deviendrez alors nos premiers Ambassadeurs !Exemples de contreparties:Veste softshell

Manchettes


Bidon 500ml
