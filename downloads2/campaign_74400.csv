<p>Hello! My name is Megan Malnar and I am a missionary living in Lusaka, Zambia.  In November of 2011, the Lord called me to be a mom to a Zambian boy.  Over the course of the next 6 months, I met my son, Elijah.  In August of 2012, he was placed into my home and since then, we have grown to be a mother and son. Every day I learn more and more about him.  I am without a doubt confident that Elijah and I were made for each other.   </p>
<p>Adoption is a beautiful display of the gospel. Adoption brings extreme glory to our King.  There are 143 MILLION reasons for a person to adopt.</p>
<p>Elijah was chosen by the Lord to live a life his current situation did not allow.  He was chosen to be my son. I am chosen to raise him in a culture of captivation for our Savior Jesus.</p>
<p>I first was called to Zambia to be a missionary, but now I'm also called to be a mom.  I raise support to sustain our every day, and the Lord is so very faithful bringing what we need financially each month.  However, being on a missionary salary leaves little to no room for saving for adoption costs.</p>
<p>I ask for you to financially partner with us to help Elijah have a forever home!  There is no amount to small to give. Your contribution will DIRECTLY change our family!!</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>Costs</strong></h3>
</div>
<div>
<p>The costs of adoption can vary from country to country.  Intercountry adoption (adopting outside of the U.S.) tends to cost anywhere from $3,000-$30,000, due to requirements from both countries, airfare for multiple visits to the country, accommodation while staying in country, and miscellaneous items that come up along the way.</p>
<p>In our case, Elijah's adoption will cost $7,500.</p>
<p>Expenses for the U.S. side of the adoption total to $3,500. Expenses for the Zambian side of the adoption total to the amount of $4,000. These costs include the following: home study, filing paperwork, fingerprints, immigrant visa, new passport and birth certificate, lawyer, court fees, airfare, readoption in the U.S. <strong>$2,000 of this amount is needed by October 27th!!</strong></p>
<p>My goal is to raise the money by December 1st in order to eliminate any possible delays!  My hope is to finalize the adoption before we plan to come back to America in May 2013. However, many of the fees will need to be paid several months before we come home!</p>
<p>Every amount donated will go directly to the above needs!  If more money is donated than my goal, I plan to use it towards Elijah's schooling in Zambia, which is $3,000 a year!  He's in school now and flourishing!!</p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you can't give financially, but want to contribute to helping Elijah have a forever home, here are some ways you can help!</p>
<p>1. Get the word out!!  Tell friends and family our story! They may be able to give or they may know someone who can give!</p>
<p>2. PRAY!  Adoption is a long long process in Zambia.  Nothing is concrete and there are many delays in the process.  Please pray for a smooth process!</p>
</div></div>","Hello! My name is Megan Malnar and I am a missionary living in Lusaka, Zambia.  In November of 2011, the Lord called me to be a mom to a Zambian boy.  Over the course of the next 6 months, I met my son, Elijah.  In August of 2012, he was placed into my home and since then, we have grown to be a mother and son. Every day I learn more and more about him.  I am without a doubt confident that Elijah and I were made for each other.   
Adoption is a beautiful display of the gospel. Adoption brings extreme glory to our King.  There are 143 MILLION reasons for a person to adopt.
Elijah was chosen by the Lord to live a life his current situation did not allow.  He was chosen to be my son. I am chosen to raise him in a culture of captivation for our Savior Jesus.
I first was called to Zambia to be a missionary, but now I'm also called to be a mom.  I raise support to sustain our every day, and the Lord is so very faithful bringing what we need financially each month.  However, being on a missionary salary leaves little to no room for saving for adoption costs.
I ask for you to financially partner with us to help Elijah have a forever home!  There is no amount to small to give. Your contribution will DIRECTLY change our family!!
 
Costs


The costs of adoption can vary from country to country.  Intercountry adoption (adopting outside of the U.S.) tends to cost anywhere from $3,000-$30,000, due to requirements from both countries, airfare for multiple visits to the country, accommodation while staying in country, and miscellaneous items that come up along the way.
In our case, Elijah's adoption will cost $7,500.
Expenses for the U.S. side of the adoption total to $3,500. Expenses for the Zambian side of the adoption total to the amount of $4,000. These costs include the following: home study, filing paperwork, fingerprints, immigrant visa, new passport and birth certificate, lawyer, court fees, airfare, readoption in the U.S. $2,000 of this amount is needed by October 27th!!
My goal is to raise the money by December 1st in order to eliminate any possible delays!  My hope is to finalize the adoption before we plan to come back to America in May 2013. However, many of the fees will need to be paid several months before we come home!
Every amount donated will go directly to the above needs!  If more money is donated than my goal, I plan to use it towards Elijah's schooling in Zambia, which is $3,000 a year!  He's in school now and flourishing!!

I'm Lisa Marchesini and I opened Shala Yoga Center in 2010 to provide a space for a yoga community that was sorely needed in east county San Diego.  My big dream was to create a center where wellness practitioners would work co-operativly in an effort to provide quality affordable supportive health measures to all of you! After almost 5 years, the opportunity to provide such a space is in sight.  

As a mother, I know how hard it is to take time for myself, even to work, the guilt of it vs the very real threat of burn out. 

I'm teaming up with some amazing mamas. Judy Huang-Chetti , an amazingly talented acupuncturist and Adriana Walczewski, our own child enrichment guru. Our vision is to expand our schedule and open a treatment room for acupuncture and massage, that can transform into a childcare space for select classes. This will provide more options for all of you that need a break and are ready to reconnect  and heal physically and spiritually. We highly value our community and believe we offer a unique studio atmosphere to all of our members. 





What We Need & What You Get


The question we keep hearing – “Why a crowdfunding campaign?”  As a community studio, Shala Yoga Center wants to get you involved, and of course, offer you some amazing perks for your support. In addition to pursuing traditional forms of raising money, we want ensure that our community continues to play an active role in our growth.

<p><b>              WHY AN INBOUND AGENCY FOR AND BY AMERICANS?</b></p>
<p><b><br/></b></p>
<p><b></b></p>
<p>German,
Italian, French, and many other tourists in DR have access to professional
travel companies in DR that are owned and operated by their fellow country women
and men, ensuring that they plan travel with professionals who understand them
culturally--professionals they can trust. 
These tourist do and see more for less—safely.</p>
<p>Americans, who travel in larger numbers to DR and spend more money in the economy than the
next 3 groups combined, do not have access to such a travel agency in DR and
are often “herded” on compound style resorts, so we started Discplora Trek
Tours.</p>

              WHY AN INBOUND AGENCY FOR AND BY AMERICANS?


German,
Italian, French, and many other tourists in DR have access to professional
travel companies in DR that are owned and operated by their fellow country women
and men, ensuring that they plan travel with professionals who understand them
culturally--professionals they can trust. 
These tourist do and see more for less—safely.
Americans, who travel in larger numbers to DR and spend more money in the economy than the
next 3 groups combined, do not have access to such a travel agency in DR and
are often “herded” on compound style resorts, so we started Discplora Trek
Tours.

                              Risks & Challenges
  The idea of a strictly inbound travel agency is not as common as we at Discplora Trek Tours feel it should be.  Our work will be difficult and challenging, but we are already seeing positive responses to our business concept and plans from both local travel suppliers in the Dominican Republic, as well as current and prospective clients.  Here's a look at a few of challenges we will face along the way: 
Local labor laws and corresponding matters of human resources. Bureaucratic legal processes for company registration.
Cultural barriers in business matters, including managing product delivery strategy with local suppliers.
Training of local employees.
Educating clients who are accustomed to utilizing out-bound travel agencies for the planning of international travel, on the benefits of using an inbound agency.  


Again, we have already organized our corporation under Dominican law and we are moving forward with some of the best tourism lawyers in the DR.  It will definitely be a challenge to train local employees to deliver the type of customer service expected by American travelers, but we have outlined a plan to identify the potential employees more suitable for our business model.  These employees will have a fluent command of the English language and significant knowledge of and experience with U.S. culture.  We are also planning major marketing campaigns to inform the current market of American travelers to the Dominican Republic (over 2 million vacationers) that there is now a professional travel company for and by Americans in DR.

<p><strong><strong>Inner Sunset Sundays’s mission is to create a temporary public gathering space – in the style of a traditional plaza – in which people live and community flourishes.</strong></strong></p>
<p>We imagine a place of play, music, song, dance, people-watching, local merchants, skill-sharing, art and culture, history, theater, discussion and debate, and community-building; somewhere people can become whole and live life to the fullest.</p>
<p>In 2011, the second annual Inner Sunset Street Fair (Inner Sunset Sundays's previous name) was attended by over 5,000 and declared a fantastic success by all. Join us this year!</p>
<p>But we're not resting on our laurels - this year things will be different. In 2012, there'll be FOUR events (tentatively September 9th, October 14th, November 11th, December 9th) on one block (Irving St between 9th and 10th Avenues). This will allow us to bring people together more often and to try many more ideas than before.</p>
<h2>To do this is going to take the whole community’s support</h2>
<p>Although we depend as much as possible on people supporting the event out of kindness rather than profit, there are still a lot of costs. Even without City fees we estimate our costs to be at least $13,000.</p>
<p>Your contribution will be critical to making this event possible. Please give whatever you can afford! We had tremendous success at the 2010 and 2011 events - this year it could be even better. But only with your help.</p>
<p>It's easy to donate. Just click the Donate button on the right and you'll be done in a minute or two. If you can't donate, please forward the the link to this page to friends and neighbors and encourage them to donate.</p>

<h3>Keeping A Promise</h3>
<p>My name is Jennifer Nelson, my brother-in-law Mark Parker passed away on April 5, 2012 after a motorcycle accident that caused severe brainstem damage.  While he was in a coma in the hospital, I made a promise to him that no matter what happened I would make sure Julie and the boys were taken care of.  So, I am starting the Parker Family Fund in honor of that promise to Mark Anthony Parker.  He not only left behind my 24 year old sister, Julie, but their two boys ages 2 and 4 years.  Those boys will slowly with time come to realize more and more the reality of the fact that they will never see daddy come home and that's a burden this family will have to bear for the rest of their lives.  The least any of us can do is help Julie get her family back on their feet, and that's what this fund is all about.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What Your Donations Will Aid In</h3>
<p>I know we have a goal of $8,000 and honestly that would be great, but any amount we are able to raise will be a tremendous help to this wounded, healing family.  Below is a basic list of what their needs are, and what the donations will be helping cover:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pay Rent and Bills</li>
<li>Remaining balance of funeral and burial of Mark</li>
<li>Buy Food, Diapers, Necessities</li>
<li>Help in Fixing or Replacing Julie's Car</li>
<li>Childcare</li>
<li>Any other needs or one(s) that may arise</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Every cent will go straight to the Parker Family.    No one can truly take the burden of being a young widow with two sweet boys that will grow up without their loving daddy, eventhough that's my greatest desire.  Julie already has so much on her mind, and soul, and definitley with her strength to keep going for her boys I want to ask for help to take the financial worries out of that long list for her.  Even if only for a short while.  Everyone who donates is helping make that possible for her.  </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Money Isn't the Only Way To Help</h3>
<p>Trust me, I understand when you don't even have a $1.00 to give, but the power of word of mouth can be extremely powerful.  Please be sure to pass this along in anyway you can.  Prayer is also an amazing power that even with my belief I will never understand, but I know it makes a difference as well.  So I ask that you keep the Parker family in your thoughts and prayers as well.  Start a prayer chain if that's something you felt led to do as well.</p>

<h3><strong>OUR STORY</strong></h3>
<p>The everyday wine drinker buys its booze in the grocery store and often makes really <em>profound</em> decisions: Red? White? Rosé? Okay, maybe I am exaggerating here and our interested customer knows about the region and the grape too.</p>
<p>But in the supermarket alone are hundreds of bottles and the sales clerk is not really helpful, since he drinks only beer or his qualifications are probably specialized on cleaning agents. Choosing a bottle of wine can be something for gamblers! <em>Rien ne va plus</em> - let the games begin!</p>
<p>Too exhausting! So let’s pay a visit to our local wine dealer. Ups, … travelling there the can be a real vacation, since not everybody has really a <em>local</em> dealer. Anyway, finally there, we get a lot of information about <em>terroir</em>, <em>tannic acids</em>, <em>varietal</em> and many other things to know from the well informed sales person (aka. “wine nerd”).  </p>
<p>“But hey, can I have a little booklet about all the things you just mentioned? No? Okay … very sad, since tomorrow I won’t remember a thing of what you just said! Actually, I just want a simple bottle of wine. You choose for me and I am outa here!”</p>
<p>Does this experience sound familiar to you? Great, so listen up: <strong>3grapes.com</strong> takes you on an unforgettable guided journey to the world of wine - without leaving you house.</p>
<p>In our comfortable subscription package we will deliver you once a month two bottles of wine and a booklet with many interesting, some funny background information about what you get, where it is from and who produces it. Come with us to a journey you will never regret!</p>
<p>We bring color to your life: red, white and rosé!                                                                      </p>
<h3><strong>WHO WE ARE</strong></h3>
<p>On uncountable trips through Italy, France and Spain, we discovered many small and even smaller vineyards producing extraordinary wines where you feel the glowing afternoon sun on your tongue! But the sad thing is, you won’t get those great wines here - not in the store, (and oh wonder!) not even in the internet.</p>
<p>Those family owned wineries don’t have access to the established whole sales channels since the production quantities are just too small and the trading structures are just too rigid. As a result in our supermarkets we only get the high margin, mainstream mediocrity.  </p>
<p>With our project, we want to support those great small companies, keeping the diversity alive and introduce you to tastes from rural landscapes without big names.</p>
<h3><strong>WE NEED YOUR HELP</strong></h3>
<p>Since our professional roots are in the online business, we have an established network of marketers and agencies and have furthermore many ideas how to promote our story. And since there is a life after work, we have travelled the world, tasted a lot of wines and have built up relations with many wine markers across Europe.</p>
<p>But doing the marketing means spending money! We have put our bucks together and counted. But it is just not enough for the initial investments in logistics infrastructure, inventory and marketing.</p>
<p>So we need your help! But we do not want your money as a gift. That’s why all our perks are laid out that you buy one of our wine subscription packages and pay in advance. The more money you spend, the more wine you will get!</p>
<p>But we would also be thankful when you support us without spending money on our wine boxes! Just tell everybody about our startup - the more people hear from us, the more likely we get our funds together!</p>
<h3><strong>WE SAY THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU</strong></h3>

<h3><strong>UNSERE STORY</strong></h3>
<p>Der ""Alltagsweintrinker"" kauft seinen Wein im Supermarkt und entscheidet nach rot, weiß oder rosé, nach Trockenheitsgrad und nicht zuletzt nach Etikett und Flaschenform - vielleicht noch nach Region, Traube und ""Terroir"".</p>
<p>Bereits im Supermarkt reihen sich jedoch oftmals viele Flaschen aneinander und das Personal hat leider wenig Ahnung in Sachen Wein (ist aber vielleicht bei Putzmitteln besser informiert). <em>Rien ne va plus:</em> Das Glücksspiel beim Griff ins Weinregal beginnt!</p>
<p>Also gehen wir lieber gleich in den beratungsorientierten Weinfachhandel. Ups, in ländlichen Gebieten ist allein das schon eine kleine Urlaubsreise. Sind wir endlich da, sehen wir den Wein vor lauter Flaschen nicht! Zum Glück gibt es einen informierten Verkäufer (aka. <em>„Wein-Nerd“</em>), der uns nicht vollends als önologischen Dummkopf dastehen lässt.</p>
<p>Nach anregenden Vorträgen über Ausbau, Tanningehalt und Abgang sind wir verwirrter als zuvor! War zwar irgendwie interessant, aber merken konnte ich mir das alles nicht – gibt’s das nochmal zum Nachlesen? Nein? Schade! Eigentlich wünsche ich mir einfach eine Flasche guten Wein.

<p>Oh je, wenn’s Dir auch so geht, dann pass jetzt auf: 3grapes nimmt Dich mit auf eine Erlebnis- und Entdeckungsreise in die geheime Welt des Weins.</p>
<p><strong>Im praktischen Wein-Abo erhältst Du jeden Monat zwei ausgesuchte Flaschen Spitzenwein von einem Geheimtipp-Weingut aus der alten Welt. Dazu gibt’s im beigefügten Booklet teils spannende, teils witzige Hintergründe über den Wein, den Winzer und das Weingut.</strong></p>
<p>Dein Alltag ist eintönig genug! Wir bringen Farbe in Dein Leben: rot, weiß oder rosé!</p>
<h3><strong>WER WIR SIND</strong></h3>
<p>Auf unzähligen Reisen durch Italien und Frankreich haben wir viele kleine und superkleine Weingüter entdeckt, die tollen Wein herstellen und lokal vermarkten. Daher gibt’s diese Weine leider weder im Supermarkt, noch beim lokalen Weinhändler und -echtes Wunder- nicht einmal im Internet!</p>
<p>Diesen familiär geführten Weingütern sind die etablierten Großhandelsstrukturen leider verschlossen. Weil Abnahmebedingungen zu starr, Produktionsmengen zu klein und damit internationaler Vertrieb einfach zu teuer wird.</p>
<p>Wir wollen diese lokale Vielfalt erhalten und diesen Weinproduzenten den Weg nach Deutschland öffnen, in dem wir sie in der Direktvermarktung über Wein-Abos promoten. Denn dieser exklusive Vertriebsweg direkt zur interessierten Zielgruppe (z.B. Dich) bringt für alle Vorteile: Du bekommst regelmäßig echte Wein-Geheimtipps und der Winzer erschließt sich einen neuen Kundenkreis.

<p>Hi! We're Chris and Kristin, Virginia natives that have been living in Panama for the past four years. We originally came to Bocas del Toro, Panama for SCUBA diving and have since fallen in love with this wild and beautiful Caribbean archipelago. Over the past two years, we have dedicated ourselves to creating a place for people to stay on the beach that coexists with the incredible nature that is found on the jungle island of Bastimentos.  The result of our efforts is an eco-friendly luxury camping resort called <a href=""http://www.palmartentlodge.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Palmar Tent Lodge</a>. Palmar is a place where you can really experience the natural side of Bocas as you spend your days lounging on beautiful Red Frog Beach and your nights falling asleep to the peaceful sounds of the jungle and the rhythm of breaking waves.  Activities abound, from hiking the trails of Bastimentos Island, exploring the surrounding beaches and reefs, flying the sky on a canopy tour or just relaxing in a hammock with a cocktail.  There is something here for everyone.</p>
<p><img alt=""Safari Tent at Palmar Tent Lodge"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://bocasdeltoro.travel/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Palmar-Tent-Lodge-Red-Frog-Beach-3.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Safari Tent at Palmar Tent Lodge""/></p>
<p>Accommodations at the lodge range from cozy and comfortable private safari style tents to spacious 6 person shared dorm tents or for those who want an authentic camping experience, we have campsites where you can pitch your own tent. The tent lodge opened in October 2012 and has been so successful in it's first year that we have already added more tents for 2013 so that we can accommodate more guests, including groups of up to 30.  In our second year, we want to focus on promoting the lodge for group events, especially retreats. We already have one yoga retreat scheduled and have spoken with numerous other coordinators that are interested in hosting wellness retreats in the beautiful, tranquil setting that we have right on the edge of the jungle on Red Frog Beach. We also have been fielding inquiries from those who want to plan their dream Caribbean beach wedding at the lodge.</p>

<p>Our biggest issue for actually securing more of these events is that we are still lacking a structure that we can offer our clients to use during their retreat for the practice of yoga, meditation, or any other activity requiring a large, open space.  We are ready to start marketing ourselves as a retreat destination but need YOUR help to fund the last piece of the puzzle.  In return, we would love to share our beautiful lodge with you!</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need to raise at least $10,000 for permits, materials and labor to complete the basic structure. We would like to build a 24’x24’ wooden platform with a roof to protect from the tropical rains in the area. We plan to use Nispero, a locally sourced lumber that is extremely durable and holds up well in the humid climate and also resists other threats such as termites. Building on the islands is no easy task and there are many added costs when you are constructing “off the grid”.  For example, due to our remote location, the costs just to transport the wood to the lodge will be at least  $650. After the lumber is hand cut by chainsaw, it is loaded into a massive dugout canoe (called a cayuko) to bring it by water to our dock. From there, we will need to pay at least 20 of the local men to help haul the heavy wood a half a mile across the island to the building site. When building begins, all power tools need to be run off of a generator because solar power (our main power source at the lodge) cannot support the amount of electricity needed to run power saws and drills.</p>
<p>Other items that we would like to include if we are able to raise enough money beyond the initial $10,000 for the structure are:</p>
<p>-Custom rain curtains so that even in the windiest rainstorms, you could still be dry and comfortable inside.</p>
<p>-a custom yoga-art sculpture by a local artist carved out of an old tree trunk by chainsaw, similar to those we have in the great house of the tent lodge</p>
<p>-a small storage closet area for yoga mats and other supplies</p>
<p>-solar powered lighting for nighttime use</p>
<p>-a solar powered stereo system</p>
<p>-A massage table and curtains to utilize the space for massages on a daily basis.</p>

<h3>What this means for us...</h3>

We also often host volunteer yoga instructors and this will enable us to offer classes at any time, rain or shine, to our guests!</p>
<p>We have experience in island construction, as witnessed by the existing lodge, and have proven to be successful with our marketing and customer service as well. The lodge stays over 80% full for the majority of the year and is usually completely booked during high season.

We have been given the opportunity to partake in this but we need financial assistance in order to complete the building of our design. We are a group of second year Bachelor of Architectural Studies students at Unitec Institute of Technology, hoping to have it built.</p>
<p>The design is a tunnel formed from a series of triangular structures, with ropes strung along them which are lit up with LED lights to create an interior experience through the space. This installation will be seen in Wynyard Quarter in Auckland City, New Zealand.</p>
<p>More details on Artweek Auckland can be found on their website.<br/><a href=""http://artweekauckland.co.nz/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://artweekauckland.co.nz/</a><br/></p>

<ul>
<li>Timber</li>
<li>Polyethene Rope</li>

<li>Transportation Costs (Trailer Hire)</li>
</ul>

</div></div>","Short Summary This project is for an installation in Artweek Auckland, taking place from October 10-18. We have been given the opportunity to partake in this but we need financial assistance in order to complete the building of our design. We are a group of second year Bachelor of Architectural Studies students at Unitec Institute of Technology, hoping to have it built.
The design is a tunnel formed from a series of triangular structures, with ropes strung along them which are lit up with LED lights to create an interior experience through the space. This installation will be seen in Wynyard Quarter in Auckland City, New Zealand.
More details on Artweek Auckland can be found on their website.http://artweekauckland.co.nz/
Also visit our Facebook page which will be updated as the project moves forward.https://www.facebook.com/ifinspirationalfuture?fref=ts   What We Need & What You Get We need money to help pay for materials and installation costs, these include:

Timber
Polyethene Rope
Lights

Transportation Costs (Trailer Hire)

Unfortunately, we are unable to offer any perks for funders at this point. But if you live in the Auckland area, you can visit the installation along with all the other projects of Artweek.
Every dollar really will count towards what we can achieve with developing our project, so even if we do not reach the proposed goal, any money made will go towards helping build the design.

<p><strong>Who are we?</strong></p>
<p>3 years ago, the people of Pictou were disappointed when learning of the closing of the Ship Hector site. Fortunately, a group of concerned citizens took it upon themselves to preserve and acquire the venue. The Hector Heritage Quay is operated by a <strong>Not For Profit Society</strong> maintained entirely by <strong>VOLUNTEERS</strong> (more than 70 of them who donated more than 5513 hours of their time last season) and 5 summer students; we consistently meet and educate visitors (including Tim Horton’s Camps) from all around the world about Scottish history and how one long, arduous voyage from Scotland sculpted Nova Scotia into what it is today. The Ship Hector replica was built and is cared for by the local community. It does NOT receive subsidies or annual funding from government or agencies; therefore, we could use YOUR help!</p>
<p><strong>What Needs to be Done?</strong></p>
<p>During the 1 year in which the site was not in operation (2010) The Hector maintenance was unfortunately neglected. Therefore, this year the Ship Hector is in need of numerous repairs. For this campaign we have decided to focus on raising funds for the bowsprit (the long piece of wood jutting out from the front [see photos]). The volunteer team has been working very hard to keep up with the overall maintenance of the Ship but cannot do it alone. This fall, the rigging (meaning the ropes and such holding the bowsprit, masts, and sails together) must be fixed or totally replaced, in addition, the foremast will be removed for issues below deck! This takes professionals and is NOT a simple job (nor a cheap one). This work will potentially cost upwards of a staggering <strong>$100 000!</strong></p>
<p><strong><br/></strong>The money will mostly be going towards hiring the professionals needed for such a job, removing the existing bowsprit, completing the new one, painting and installation. This fall the ship will be turned so it will face the town and avenue on which the site is located so we need it to look in tip-top condition!</p>
<p><strong>So why not raise $100 000?</strong></p>
<p>Fair question. $100 000 is a huge number and we at the Quay are new to indiegogo and simply want to get our feet wet and see what we (YOU) can accomplish. There is no question that if we succeed at this that we will go even further for our quest for Ship excellence. <strong>Sails</strong> anyone?</p>
<p><strong>Importance/Impact of the Project.</strong></p>
<p>This work is <strong>NECESSARY</strong> for the Ship Hector to keep it in the essential conditions for visitation and if not done could spell disaster for the ship as the bowsprit is one of the main structures holding the masts in place.</p>
<p>Open from mid-May to Mid-October the ship is one of the most visited sites in Nova Scotia (over <strong>14500 visitors</strong> last season) and a pinnacle of the tourism industry in the Town of Pictou; without it, the town would suffer a great loss not only to its tourism revenue, but its cultural pride as well. After suffering a <strong>deficit of $35 000</strong> last year, your contributions will lighten the financial load this work has on the volunteer board and allow it to direct other funds to the everyday operations and maintenance of the site.</p>

Who are we?
3 years ago, the people of Pictou were disappointed when learning of the closing of the Ship Hector site. Fortunately, a group of concerned citizens took it upon themselves to preserve and acquire the venue. The Hector Heritage Quay is operated by a Not For Profit Society maintained entirely by VOLUNTEERS (more than 70 of them who donated more than 5513 hours of their time last season) and 5 summer students; we consistently meet and educate visitors (including Tim Horton’s Camps) from all around the world about Scottish history and how one long, arduous voyage from Scotland sculpted Nova Scotia into what it is today.

<p>Markets cannot survive elevated levels of fraud. They simply break down, and fail to perform.</p>
<p>Developments in the financial marketplace have been an area of interest for more than twenty years. I am somewhat disappointed, to say the least, with how things have gone. (See: <a href=""http://www.creativeinvest.com/sri/corpeth.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.creativeinvest.com/sri/corpeth.html</a>)</p>
<p>Now, there is a case before the Supreme Court that will allow every person responsible for the recent financial crisis to escape punishment. The case is <em>Gabelli v. Securities and Exchange Commission</em> and ""a decision is expected in the court's upcoming term, which ends in June.""</p>
<p>I have decided to file a research paper (called an <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amicus_curiae"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Amicus definition"">Amicus Brief</a>) with the Supreme Court explaining why letting these guys go might be a bad idea for the rest of us, but I need your help.</p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>According to one source, ""any interested party with the $1,500 to $2,000 fee it costs to submit the brief in the proper bound format, can send (an Amicus Brief) in.""</p>
<p>I am not a lawyer or pretending to be one. I might need an actual lawyer to file the thing, but I think I can get this done for $1,500. This is quite the bargain. One article stated that ""Appellate lawyers who specialize in drafting such arguments estimate that the average (Supreme Court Friend of the Court) brief can cost between $25,000 to $50,000."" T<span>he Supreme Court rules are clear:</span><br/><br/><span>""Every document filed with the Court shall be <span class=""GRcorrect"">prepared using using</span> a standard typesetting process (e. g., hot metal, <span class=""GRcorrect"">photocomposition</span>, or computer typesetting) to produce text printed in typographic (as opposed to <span class=""GRcorrect"">typewriter</span>) characters. The process used must produce a clear, black image on white paper. The text must be reproduced with a clarity that equals or exceeds the output of a laser printer.""</span><br/><br/><span>The Supreme Court does not accept electronic or laser prints. Lower Courts do. I filed a brief in United States Securities &amp; Exchange Commission vs. Citigroup Global Markets Inc. (Second Circuit Court of Appeals Case Number 11-5227). See:</span><a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/redirect?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww%2Eprlog%2Eorg%2F11948760-william-michael-cunningham-files-revised-brief-in-sec-vs-citigroup-2nd-cir-ct-of-ap%2Ehtml%3Fhosted&amp;urlhash=oUhA&amp;_t=tracking_disc"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""blank"">http://www.prlog.org/11948760-william-michael-cunningham-files-revised-brief-in-sec-vs-citigroup-2nd-cir-ct-of-ap.html?hosted</a><br/><br/><span>This means that, to file <span class=""GRcorrect"">in</span> the Supreme Court, you have to get the printing done by a professional printer.

<p><strong>Market Timing</strong></p>
<p>"" 'Market timing' refers to buying and selling mutual fund shares in a manner designed to exploit short-term pricing inefficiencies. A mutual fund sells and redeems its shares based on the fund’s net asset value ('NAV') for that day, which is usually calculated at the close of the U.S. <span class=""GRcorrect"">markets</span> at 4:00 P.M. Eastern Time. Prior to 4:00 P.M., market timers either buy or sell a fund’s <span class=""GRcorrect"">shares</span> if they believe that the fund’s last NAV is 'stale,' i.e., that it lags behind the current value of a fund’s portfolio of securities as priced earlier in the day. The market timers can then reverse the transaction at the start of the next day and make a quick profit with relatively little risk. Mutual funds like GGGF that invest in overseas securities are especially vulnerable to a kind of market timing known as 'time zone arbitrage,' whereby market timers take advantage of the fact that the foreign markets on which such funds’ portfolios of securities trade have already closed (thereby setting the closing prices for the underlying securities) before the close of U.S. <span class=""GRcorrect"">markets</span>.""</p>
<p>The bottom line: this, according to the former Attorney General of New York, “is like allowing betting on a horse race after the horses have crossed the finish line.”</p>
<p>And, it results in a real advantage: the favored client <span class=""GRcorrect"">made</span> ""185 percent, 160 percent, and 73 percent, respectively.<span class=""GRcorrect"">.</span>the rate of return for all other (fund) shareholders over the <span class=""GRcorrect"">same period was,</span> at best, negative 24.1 percent.""</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>The manager claims that ""the statute of limitations clock began to tick in 1999. The SEC did not bring charges until 2008, and ""the SEC's statute of limitations is five years in cases where the agency is seeking a financial penalty.."" Too late. Too bad. So long.</p>

<h3>What you will help achieve.</h3>
<p>If the case is decided for the Fund manager, it means that no one even remotely responsible for the financial crisis will have to worry about anything. They will all claim that the statute of limitations has run out.</p>

<p>You might say,<em> ""I don't want the SEC coming after me ten years after I have done something."" </em></p>
<p>I get that. That's why my brief suggests that the extended time limits be applied only to the SEC and only for this type of case. (If they can do it in Bush v. Gore, why not here?).

Markets cannot survive elevated levels of fraud. They simply break down, and fail to perform.
Developments in the financial marketplace have been an area of interest for more than twenty years. I am somewhat disappointed, to say the least, with how things have gone. (See: http://www.creativeinvest.com/sri/corpeth.html)
Now, there is a case before the Supreme Court that will allow every person responsible for the recent financial crisis to escape punishment. The case is Gabelli v. Securities and Exchange Commission and ""a decision is expected in the court's upcoming term, which ends in June.""
I have decided to file a research paper (called an Amicus Brief) with the Supreme Court explaining why letting these guys go might be a bad idea for the rest of us, but I need your help.
What We Need & What You Get
According to one source, ""any interested party with the $1,500 to $2,000 fee it costs to submit the brief in the proper bound format, can send (an Amicus Brief) in.""
I am not a lawyer or pretending to be one. I might need an actual lawyer to file the thing, but I think I can get this done for $1,500. This is quite the bargain. One article stated that ""Appellate lawyers who specialize in drafting such arguments estimate that the average (Supreme Court Friend of the Court) brief can cost between $25,000 to $50,000."" The Supreme Court rules are clear:""Every document filed with the Court shall be prepared using using a standard typesetting process (e. g., hot metal, photocomposition, or computer typesetting) to produce text printed in typographic (as opposed to typewriter) characters. The process used must produce a clear, black image on white paper. The text must be reproduced with a clarity that equals or exceeds the output of a laser printer.""The Supreme Court does not accept electronic or laser prints. Lower Courts do. I filed a brief in United States Securities & Exchange Commission vs. Citigroup Global Markets Inc. (Second Circuit Court of Appeals Case Number 11-5227). See:http://www.prlog.org/11948760-william-michael-cunningham-files-revised-brief-in-sec-vs-citigroup-2nd-cir-ct-of-ap.html?hostedThis means that, to file in the Supreme Court, you have to get the printing done by a professional printer. This is what the money is for.
Your perk:

A thank you email.
An electronic copy of the brief.
A signed hard copy of the brief.
An opportunity to edit the brief.
A chance to make history (this will be the first crowdfunded Amicus Brief in history...)
Why it’s important to you.
The case hinges on this: Did the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission wait ""too long to bring a civil case accusing (the fund manager) of letting a client engage in..market timing?""
Market Timing
"" 'Market timing' refers to buying and selling mutual fund shares in a manner designed to exploit short-term pricing inefficiencies. A mutual fund sells and redeems its shares based on the fund’s net asset value ('NAV') for that day, which is usually calculated at the close of the U.S. markets at 4:00 P.M. Eastern Time. Prior to 4:00 P.M., market timers either buy or sell a fund’s shares if they believe that the fund’s last NAV is 'stale,' i.e., that it lags behind the current value of a fund’s portfolio of securities as priced earlier in the day. The market timers can then reverse the transaction at the start of the next day and make a quick profit with relatively little risk. Mutual funds like GGGF that invest in overseas securities are especially vulnerable to a kind of market timing known as 'time zone arbitrage,' whereby market timers take advantage of the fact that the foreign markets on which such funds’ portfolios of securities trade have already closed (thereby setting the closing prices for the underlying securities) before the close of U.S. markets.""
The bottom line: this, according to the former Attorney General of New York, “is like allowing betting on a horse race after the horses have crossed the finish line.”
And, it results in a real advantage: the favored client made ""185 percent, 160 percent, and 73 percent, respectively..the rate of return for all other (fund) shareholders over the same period was, at best, negative 24.1 percent.""
Wow.
The manager claims that ""the statute of limitations clock began to tick in 1999. The SEC did not bring charges until 2008, and ""the SEC's statute of limitations is five years in cases where the agency is seeking a financial penalty.."" Too late. Too bad. So long.
Why did the SEC wait so long? Well, they first had to take their head out of their..I mean, there's the matter of not actually knowing about this behaviour. The manager did not publicize that they were doing this...
What you will help achieve.
If the case is decided for the Fund manager, it means that no one even remotely responsible for the financial crisis will have to worry about anything. They will all claim that the statute of limitations has run out.
But
You might say, ""I don't want the SEC coming after me ten years after I have done something."" 
I get that. That's why my brief suggests that the extended time limits be applied only to the SEC and only for this type of case. (If they can do it in Bush v. Gore, why not here?). Unless you are planning to engage in marjor market fraud, I don't think you have anything to worry about.
How does this whole thing work?
Technically, anyone can file a Friend of the Court brief. You are just giving the Court your opinion on a case. It works as follows:

You ask the lawyers in the case if you can file. In this case, it's the Solicitor General of the United States (who said yes) and some private lawyer guy (who also said yes.)
You file the thing, asking the Court (as in Supreme Court) for permission.
The document you submit must have a green cover. You have to supply forty copies. They have to be printed and bound in a certain way. The money is for the printing....
I do not have to provide a list of all who gave money in support of this effort to the Supreme Court. I simply have to say that I got outside support. I won't list you in the thing unless you want me to...and I will check with you before doing so.
The Impact
I've done this before, but not in the Supreme Court....see: http://prlog.org/11782028
Yes, the arguments in my brief were mentioned by the Court, but the chances that this thing will actually have an impact on the ruling in the Supreme Court are not high. As one person put it, ""No court is obligated to follow or even to consider the advice of an amicus curiae, even one it has invited.""
According to another article, ""In the Supreme Court's last term, only eight percent of the total 628 briefs filed by non-government amici were cited by the justices, according to a report by R. Reeves Anderson and Anthony Franze of the law firm Arnold & Porter. Of those that got a nod, nearly half were written by prominent appellate lawyers from Washington, D.C.-based firms with Supreme Court practices.
Not even the justices necessarily pay much attention to them. Antonin Scalia, in October told students at Chicago-Kent College of Law that he doesn't read amicus briefs. He instead passes them on to his clerks. Last year, former Justice John Paul Stevens complained of amici fatigue to an audience at Northwestern University Law School, saying 'we could get along with fewer amicus briefs.' ""
They don't really want to hear from me (or you) but, so what? You have the right to have your voice heard. If it doesn't work, well, at least you tried...

<p><strong>Question</strong>.... What is a Steam Turbine Engine?</p>
<div class=""full-description"">
<p>   <strong>Answer</strong>...A Steam Turbine Engine is a device that has been used for over 150 years to convert steam power to turn a generator. These same conventional steam turbines are being used on our power plants today.</p>
<p><strong>Question</strong>... How will this actually change anything?</p>
<p>   <strong>Answer</strong>.... Let me give you a simple example. Say you put a revolutionary engine in your car that will give you the ability to drive twice as far as you had normally done in the past using the same amount of fuel! This is exactly what this will do in terms of helping power facilities maximize their ability to produce electricity by more efficiently converting steam into mechanical energy!</p>
<p><strong>Question</strong>... Can't this also be utilized in coal and nuclear power plants?</p>
<p>   <strong>Answer</strong>... Yes it can, but our main focus is helping the Green Renewable Energy Industry to move beyond fossil fuels.</p>
<p><strong>Question</strong>... How will this help me directly?</p>
<p>   <strong>Answer</strong>...The dynamics of this will be felt world wide. For one it will help us achieve Energy independence. Two, all components of the Turbine Engine will be made here in the USA creating jobs to support the economy. Three, this is the big one, saving our environment...without doing this THERE WILL BE NO FUTURE! The long term benefits include reducing energy cost by eliminating the need to mine and refine fossil fuels. </p>
<p>    This is another big one....the reason why there has not been an explosion of electric cars on the road is that our current power generating infrastructure does not have the capacity to handle 50 million new electric hungry cars. This will almost double the stain on our current electrical power plants! This turbine though, can not only retrofit the coal and nuclear power plants to produce almost double production, but will open the gate for CSP and Parabolic Trough solar companies to open more facilities because it is now economically prudent.</p>
<p><br/><strong>Question</strong>...is this scalable?</p>
<p><strong>   Answer</strong>...A matter of fact yes it is! One of our main goals after we have successfully manufactured, optimized and tested the turbine is to create Mini-power generating systems small enough to fit on commercial rooftops and residential property. We should be able to not only satisfy the owners electricity needs but also have surplus pumped back into the grid to where the owners, instead of getting a bill from their electric company, get a check! This is called net metering. The ability for you to have complete control of your energy produced entirely by the sun, will be our ultimate goal. </p>

He first received a surgery which removed his appendix, and put his bowels in the correct area (after being entangled); but then after a week he needed another surgery and while doing so the doctor found gangrene in his small intestine (the technical term being a ""malrotation of his midgut volvulus"").

<p>Considering those aspects, how can we defeat poverty? In the past we thought countries such like Africa, South-America and south east Asia were the poorest in the world but now this is getting real even four us. </p>

<p><b>Have men still control?</b> </p>
<p><span><span><span></span></span></span></p>
<span><span><span><p>We need to fight for something different, practicing ethic principals in our economy. Poorest people are those who need and desire more and more and more. </p>
<p>We are inspired and look for realizing our will to fight for a new culture and this is our project: Baobab-Labuonavita. To achieve a new living style, a proper behavior style must be reviewed sinergically and this brings to correct capability to ménage our owns nourishment. </p>
<p>This is baobab-labuonavita’s philosophy: man is the focus point and choosing his proper nourishment style and consequently lifestyle. By promoting this new culture we create a connection between consumer and food, so Baobab-labuonavita becomes  agent for promoting, changing and value development. </p>

“A good nourishment..for a good life”
To read an italian version of this brochure please click here:
Indiegogo Italian Brochure
According to ISTAT, in 2011, 11,1% of Italian families is relatively poor and the 5,2% is definitely poor. Poverty soil is 1.011,03€. In 2011 the risk of poverty is about 28.4%. It is higher than the European medium level corresponding to 24.2%.
Considering those aspects, how can we defeat poverty? In the past we thought countries such like Africa, South-America and south east Asia were the poorest in the world but now this is getting real even four us. 
Man created progress and civilization by market economy and relative competition and this was positive. Unfortunately this force points have taken too much control on man themselves.


Have men still control? 

We need to fight for something different, practicing ethic principals in our economy. Poorest people are those who need and desire more and more and more. 
We are inspired and look for realizing our will to fight for a new culture and this is our project: Baobab-Labuonavita. To achieve a new living style, a proper behavior style must be reviewed sinergically and this brings to correct capability to ménage our owns nourishment. 
This is baobab-labuonavita’s philosophy: man is the focus point and choosing his proper nourishment style and consequently lifestyle. By promoting this new culture we create a connection between consumer and food, so Baobab-labuonavita becomes  agent for promoting, changing and value development. 
When you act as to reach a big changing, the big and real core spirit of our actions is reaching happiness, the most precious and important treasure we have got.

How can we reach this objective?
Everything is based on creating a new selling channel for little producers in agricultural and food industry by increasing their production capability through lowest supply chains. 
Connected to this project we can include farm holiday industry where the customers can get in touch with the area where products purchased come from, for example little “smart boxes”.  
Everything must be managed following “Labuonavita” philosophy including as follows: art, well-being, amusement culture as well as social relationship discovering areas where you meet nature architecture and culture. 
This is very important considering next expo event in Milan and it’s topic: planet nourishment, energy for life.

(Expo 2015) Our Strategy & Objective
Expo 2015 will be an extraordinary universal event which allows tradition creativity and innovation to be consider in food industry.  One core topic is human write to a healthy safe nourishment and enough for the whole planet. 
Here are some points of work and discussion: 

Increasing quality and food safety;
Ensuring healthy and quality food to all human beings to eliminate hunger and thirst as well as death in childhood and bad nourishment;
To prevent from social illness of our times from fatness to heart pathologies and cancer;
Innovation of the hole food supply chain by research, technology and enterprise;
Teaching correct nourishment to advantage new life styles in particular for children young people disabled and old people;
To give value to acknowledgement of food traditions as culture and ethnic elements;

Food is Planets life energy. It is based on a correct and constant body nourishment respecting basic life rules and health of every single human being.
Diffusion and quality of agriculture and food products is a social need beyond representing an important economy value. The core rule is represented by territory, as food quality and authenticity are connected with tradition coming from thousands of years of experience where we bring big innovation at present.
Expo shows science and technology frontier:

To protect bio-diversity, to respect environment, to defend food quality and safety, to teach nourishment for health and well-being of people;
To detect better control and innovation system starting from bio-technology to ensure healthy and nourishing food availability as well as drinking water and for irrigation;
New food sources by those planet areas where agriculture is not developed or is seriously threatened.

Expo offers many opportunities for marketing and communications to manufactures farmers, food industry, logistics and distribution, catering, research centers and to companies who want: 

To give a value to innovation and production technology in order to create a healthy food product;
To work in preparing and conservation of food increasing professional competences of addicted people and improving communications to the consumer;
To guarantee food quality by proper checking and protecting system

We also intend to involve national and international research institute to offer a scientific support to our project’s development. We will get space among certified analysis of food, implying their database, composing proper diet programs including cooking methods. 
This will be the passage which allows us to be different from classic e-commerce offered by present market.
A real innovation!!
The business is made of by interactive synergic fields, for each of them we chose people having specific competent, above all young people! 


""Closing the circle""

<h3><b>What if you could use a small amount of your travel loyalty points to give an amazing gift of compassion to someone, not an organization but to a specific person who needed to see their loved one who was terminally or critically ill? Would you do that?</b></h3>
<p>We have an idea and we believe it can help thousands of people; but, we need your help to make this idea a reality. </p>
<h3><b>That idea is to ""microgive” small amounts of your travel loyalty points via a web application to a specific person in need of seeing a terminally or critically ill loved one. </b></h3>

<p><b><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/13640/files/20130815061925-indie.jpg?1376572765"" src="""" style=""""/></b></p>
<b><br/></b><p></p>
<p><b></b></p>
<b>
</b><p>So
I would give 100 points, you would give 100 points, our friends would give 100
points to Joe who needs to fly to see his terminally ill father.  We think
this is an amazing gift of compassion. </p>
<h4>There
are 3 key elements to the idea we are trying to make happen:</h4>
<p>1) <b>A
tangible outcome</b> - your points are not going to an organization they
are going to a specific person’s story that you choose to connect with.
This is how we believe the new social media giving model works.  Donate to
a specific person and a tangible outcome.</p>
<p> 2) <b>Via
the Web</b> – the transaction has to be easy and simple for those donating
and those receiving points.</p>
<p><b>3) 100% donation model </b>– all points given go to that specific person’s story to help
them not to an organization in the middle.</p>
<h4><b><i>What will the funds be used for?</i></b></h4>
<p>100%
of the Indiegogo funds raised will go towards making the website application a reality.  Give A Mile is a
federally registered Canadian Not For Profit and 100% volunteer
organization.  All monies collected will go directly into building this application and making this vision happen. </p>
<h4><b><i>What loyalty point programs are you building this application
for? </i></b></h4>
<p>The
answer is TBD, we are in talks with several loyalty programs that operate in
Canada but as with all new ideas there is a chicken and egg effect
happening.  The loyalty programs have told us this is a great idea but we
need to show them it’s more than just an idea. We need to show these loyalty
programs that the larger community supports and loves this idea. They are also very busy running their businesses so by building the application platform we
believe we can accelerate adopting this idea.  If you have contacts in any of the loyalty programs please
send them to us so we can further our discussion.  If you are a representative of a loyalty
program looking to partner on this idea, please contact us. </p>
<h4><b><i>When will I be able to donate points? </i></b></h4>
<p>It
will take some time to do this via the application.  There are many steps on this journey.  First we
need to raise the money, and then we need to build an application. Building an
app has many steps such as proof of concepts, design, development and testing. We also need to
establish our partnership with the loyalty programs.  Application software development takes time, but we are 100% committed to making this happen.  We want to help people travel to see loved ones as soon as we can make it possible. </p>
<p>In the meantime, we have given our very first flight via a manual donation and plan on doing several more via this method. Follow our social media feeds as we will be sharing more about this in the coming weeks -  @giveamile and <a href=""http://www.giveamile.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.giveamile.org</a> </p>
<h4><b>How will you ensure that people are not defrauding the system?</b></h4>
<p>We
believe 99.9% of people are good and would never dream of something like that, but we understand the concerns
about misuse.  We would require people’s stories to be shared via social
media so that the community can monitor itself and report any wrongdoings.
 We also have talked to several organizations that work with people in these types of situations who have vetting processes and have an identified
community already in place that could use this service.</p>
<h4><b><i>What happens if for some reason you cannot make this idea
work?</i></b></h4>
<p>We
are a tenacious bunch and we have a 100% belief that we can make this happen.  If for some
reason this cannot be implemented we will donate all the remaining funds to

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Historic Manheim Park is a diverse urban, community located in central Kansas City. The community has experienced decline over the past four decades but within the past few years, has begun to experience a notable renewal. To continue this momentum, our community was awarded a $20,000 grant by a Kansas City-based organization, the Community Capital Fund to help us organize our community into block teams, sponsor community clean-up and other events such as community gardens. With the grant we also want to capture the talents present in our community so that we can begin to leverage them to further develop our community.</p>

To complete the asset mapping portion of the project, we will be working with Dr. Jake Wagner from our local University of Missouri at Kansas City, Department of Architecture and Planning. Dr. Wagner will develop the asset mapping instrument, train volunteers, walk the entire neighborhood to collect data, analyze data and work with neighborhood leaders to create a comprehensive “asset catalog.”  Our asset catalog will contain information about members of the community who have special skills such as home repair, computer repair, landscaping, etc.</p>

The Make a Difference Foundation grew out of the after math of Hurricane Sandy.
On October 29, 2012, Hurricane Sandy blew into the state of NJ and devastated many areas. Families lost homes and cars in massive flood waters. Even where homes were still standing, residents were forced to throw away entire contents of basements and first floor dwellings that were touched by contaminated water.
Immediately following the storm, there was no shortage of people willing to donate food, clothing and money. However, one year

<h3>KB Computers, the short story.</h3>
<p>KB Computers LLC was started to assist those who have a hard time with understanding computers, or those who just want to learn more about what they (computers) can do. In the area we started there are quite a few people who think computers are nothing more than a paper weight. As our company went around the area and the U.S., we realized that those kinds of people are all over the U.S. We are going to do our best to keep our advice general but up to date.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>The funds raised here at Indiegogo will allow us to get a head start on going beyond our own boarders and do what we love to do, helping people. Our staff is friendly and more than willing to help anyone from your little kid to your grandmother. With the money we will be able to out fit our staff with better and newer computers, depending on how much is raised, we may even be able to buy a vehicle to get our staff around the area.</p>

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>Throughout human history, there has lived and endured a belief in the unity of all humanity - an understanding that there is, at our foundation, a common and essential soil of being human. But it has not been until today, in this moment of history, that the true coming together of humankind has become realizable. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Emerging Face of a Nationless World is a campaign to connect the voices and stories of distinct communities, worldwide, to show the inter-connected nature of our global experiences and struggles; and to create a platform to facilitate increased communication and collaboration between these communities, ultimately towards building a greater sense of ""oneness"".  </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Already with participation from groups across the United States, in China, France, Nigeria, Chile, and the Philippines, the Nationless World campaign has also received the commitment of support from such organizations as <i>National Geographic</i>.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>The campaign is being produced by <i>Stone Forest New York</i>, a registered 501(c)3 not-for-profit, based in New York.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><font class=""Apple-style-span"" color=""#003399"" size=""2""><b>(see more about the campaign: <a href=""http://www.nationlessworld.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.nationlessworld.com</a>)</b></font></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><font class=""Apple-style-span"" size=""2""><br/></font></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>As one of our supporting organizations stated: ""I write this letter to express my support for Jie-Song Zhang and the Emerging Face of a Nationless World campaign... in recognition of the campaign's artistic and cultural value, and the campaign's potential to significantly encourage mutual awareness and understanding between global cultures and communities"" - <i>National Geographic</i></p>
<p><i><br/></i></p>
<p></p>
<p>The impact is that of allowing communities across the world to better see and hear one another, to better relate, to better plan, understand, and work *together*. Our impact is that of walking humanity forward, in taking this inevitable and necessary step in our great collective movement.</p>
<div><br/></div>
<p></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>This fundraising is to generate resources by which to produce our next two videos (one being shot around the world), to do continued outreach across the globe, and to further develop our online and offline tools that will create a rich platform for global discussion and engagement.

</div></div>","Our Story
Throughout human history, there has lived and endured a belief in the unity of all humanity - an understanding that there is, at our foundation, a common and essential soil of being human. But it has not been until today, in this moment of history, that the true coming together of humankind has become realizable. 

Emerging Face of a Nationless World is a campaign to connect the voices and stories of distinct communities, worldwide, to show the inter-connected nature of our global experiences and struggles; and to create a platform to facilitate increased communication and collaboration between these communities, ultimately towards building a greater sense of ""oneness"".  

Already with participation from groups across the United States, in China, France, Nigeria, Chile, and the Philippines, the Nationless World campaign has also received the commitment of support from such organizations as National Geographic.

The campaign is being produced by Stone Forest New York, a registered 501(c)3 not-for-profit, based in New York.

(see more about the campaign: www.nationlessworld.com)



The Impact
As one of our supporting organizations stated: ""I write this letter to express my support for Jie-Song Zhang and the Emerging Face of a Nationless World campaign... in recognition of the campaign's artistic and cultural value, and the campaign's potential to significantly encourage mutual awareness and understanding between global cultures and communities"" - National Geographic


The impact is that of allowing communities across the world to better see and hear one another, to better relate, to better plan, understand, and work *together*. Our impact is that of walking humanity forward, in taking this inevitable and necessary step in our great collective movement.



What We Need & What You Get
This fundraising is to generate resources by which to produce our next two videos (one being shot around the world), to do continued outreach across the globe, and to further develop our online and offline tools that will create a rich platform for global discussion and engagement. These amount to film production expenses, and web development expenses.

What you get as a funder, is ultimately to become a member of this movement, being brought in to our contingent of individuals across the globe working to build this new, shared world. But there will also be tangible rewards, such as artists' merchandise, that will be given to donors as a gesture of appreciation in standing with us.


Other Ways You Can Help
In addition to donations, you can help by helping to spread our campaign video, as well as by sharing information about this fundraiser and campaign (www.nationlessworld.com) with those in your face-to-face and online communities.

<p class=""p1""><strong>Please watch the short video above first.</strong></p>
<p class=""p2"">We are taking a 60 ft by 100 vacant lot in Clinton Hill Brooklyn and rapidly transforming it into a high yield urban farming facility using Aquaponics(a symbiotic relationship between plants and food). The facility will also serve as a training place to teach attendees the natural disciplines (growing their own food, herbal healthcare, easy localized energy production, and a host of other things.</p>
<p class=""p4"">Last but not least it will also serve as a nightly venue in which Jazz musicians (both world famous and up and coming will perform.</p>
<p class=""p4"">This first prototype is the blueprint for a rapidly constructed kit that we plan to replicate throughout NYC, the USA and Europe, and beyond thus creating a global network of urban food production facilities and jazz club in which all participants are guaranteed healthy food, preventative herbal healthcare, and proper wages.</p>
<p class=""p4""> This prototype facility requires 137K to be built. It will take 6 weeks. Facilities after that will cost a fraction of this and will be assembled extremely faster.</p>
<h3>Full Overview Summary</h3>
<p class=""p1"">Hey. My name is Malachi ""Mike"" Basden. I am a soprano saxophonist, audio-visual performance artist; animator and illustrator who is also passionate about sustainability, especially in the difficult times we live in. I am also a certified earthen builder and have taught workshops around the world. My background in the sustainable movement and natural disciplines includes permaculture, aquaponics and alternate natural energy. I've also invented and designed a few things along the way to aid us all to move “off the grid”. In addition, I have worked as an animator on films, TV and have a few interesting and funny interactive/video games coming out later this year.</p>
<p class=""p1"">The Jazzaponics project pretty much combines all that stuff into one important project that will benefit all of us with a lot of fun along the way.</p>
<p class=""p1"">The Jazzaponics project intends to create hybrid naturally built facilities around the world in which food is grown locally using Aquaponics with local residents learning the natural disciplines to build sustainable communities around those disciplines. The prototype for these facilities is in Brooklyn, New York.</p>
<p class=""p1""> Jazzaponics will not only serve as an urban produce generating facility and learning place, it will also be a network of venues where Jazz music and people come together as a community to listen to music performed by some of the world's greatest musicians. For a small entrance fee you will be fed a meal made from fresh food grown on the property while networking and being entertained.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Imagine going out for the evening for only 25 dollars and getting a really good meal, beverages and amazing music. The premise is for world class musicians to be paid correctly for their performances. And you get to hang out and meet like-minded people from all demographics. </p>
<p class=""p1"">The days of huge cover charges, 15 dollars for a glass of wine and the musicians should be grateful they have a place to play for cheap are over. When Jazzaponics events take in more money than the cost of the event, that surplus is shared among the musicians and the folks working that venue fairly and evenly. </p>
<p class=""p1"">It is the ultimate goal of this project to bring food security to urban areas around the world and demonstrate that sustainability and the natural way can be cost-effective for all participants in a number of diverse ways, while setting an example for a new way of existing in harmony with the planet we call earth.</p>
<p class=""p1"">The fact is the planet is in a paradigm shift as I write this and even the main stream media is taking notice with the extreme weather and loss of considerable corn and soybean crops because of it.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Food prices are going up sharply in the US and around the world. The aim of this project is to put as many urban farms in as many cities as quickly as possible while having really great music and a good time. I spend a lot of time in New Orleans. It would be great to have that sort of fun loving musically rich and inclusive atmosphere in Jazzaponics facilities in Brooklyn, NY and around the world, while at the same time making sure as many people as possible have food security. That would be more than cool.</p>
<p class=""p1""><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<p class=""p2""> We need a minimum of 137,000 dollars to get this prototype facility built. The architecture firm that is extremely good at making sure we have all permits and so on from the NYC Dept. of Buildings is charging 37K to finalize our designs and plans for approval as well as oversee the heavier construction aspects like the cranes to get the shipping containers into place as well as the frame for the roof etc. This sounds like a lot but I have worked with these people before and they are extremely good at getting it done without headaches and once we have the prototype airtight as far as zoning rules, permits, and so on, the next facility in NYC or wherever will be so much easier as we have our template in place.</p>
<p class=""p1"">The remaining money is to be used to set foundations to build all this on concrete. We need to buy the shipping containers and have them plasma cut to our specs, we need steel for the roofing and second and third floors, specialized greenhouse Plexiglas for the greenhouse roof, all the pipes for the plumbing and the growing towers, not to mention seeds, growing medium and supplies. We will have fish for the aquaponics growers and, chickens for fresh eggs daily. We plan to have three forms of alternate energy which need to be implemented correctly. They are not expensive but need some skilled tech people to create convertors, battery storage units and enclosures. We also need shovels, wheel barrels, and smaller construction tools for the earthen building insulation such as straw bales, and sand and so on….</p>
<p class=""p1"">The fact is the initial framing designed is meant to be like a kit that can be duplicated as many times as possible and shipped to wherever we build another facility at a fraction of the prototype costs.</p>
<p class=""p1"">As stated, this is the minimum budget we came up with to get this built. We are initiating another campaign for a smaller amount to develop a personalized version of our growing towers which will generate cash flow by selling small inexpensive and effective vertical grower to make sure you can grow your own fresh food within the urban environment and our musicians have salaries. You can check that out at…LINK</p>
<p class=""p1"">Your help and contribution to getting this done as soon as possible will take form in many cool perks which range from digital albums of the many musicians involved, to free admittance to events, trainings, concerts, merchandise, apps, food grown at the facility, and fun experiences starting with hanging out with the world's greatest musicians - all the way up to a 4 day stay at the upcoming sister facility in Anguilla in the Caribbean. That’s where we are planning to build next!</p>
<p class=""p1"">If we don't reach our goal then we proceed as best we can and insulate the container structures to act as a greenhouse and we will still grow and have the events and music. We most likely would have to scale up on the earthen building component as best as NYC building would let us, and concentrate on the selling of food, personalized growers, and push the entertainment aspect a bit more than the educational in the early days. Jazzaponics is a worldwide necessity so failure is not an option.</p>
<p class=""p1""> </p>
<p class=""p1"">If we exceed our goal amount then we get the prototype up and running quicker, hire people we will need to administrate that are highly efficient and start paying salaries to musicians.</p>
<p class=""p1"">If we really exceed our goal then the excess would be used to get our next facility up and running quickly.</p>
<p class=""p1""><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<p class=""p1"">You cannot have infinite growth on a planet with finite resources. The use of fossil fuels have propelled our global civilization to great height but now there are 7 billion of us on a finite planet and the resources just are not there and cannot replenish themselves fast enough.</p>
<p class=""p1"">The party is over in the infinite growth paradigm and now a new one begins with sustainability and back to nature principals even within the urban environment. This is a part of the new let the planet heal paradigm. Don’t get scared, get prepared!</p>
<p class=""p1"">This project has a low carbon footprint, generates food without soil, as well as jobs wherever these facilities will be and guarantees food security, community, fun, great music, and a lot of soulful good times for all.</p>
<p class=""p1"">It is time that as many of us as possible learn the natural ways and apply them with our current knowledge to make something that is new were we enjoy our lives and each other and the planet, and ultimately not have to kill ourselves for fiat currency so that we can eat. This project has many folks that will teach you. It is not hard. It is nature and you are from nature. We all have been taught from birth that we are not… but at the end of the day we are …and it is encoded on our DNA to live as a part of the planet, not it's overlords. Mother Nature always has the last word.</p>
<p class=""p1"">20 years ago I had the honor, privilege and great fortune of having the trumpeter Wynton Marsalis hire me as his personal assistant. I like to say it was one of the best periods of my life, but not the easiest. Wynton was an extremely harsh task master while at the same time really smart, articulate, soulful , intelligent, and funny guy.</p>
<p class=""p3"">I was privy to observe and participate in how he ran his business dealings, take a band on the road, write his music, practice music, and among a lot of other things, I got to see him formulate and execute what was the beginnings of what would later become Jazz at Lincoln Center. </p>
<p class=""p3""> Anyone that has been there would agree it is a monumental achievement. The 12 to 14 people that were the core of the organization are still like family to me and some of them are part of this project. </p>
<p class=""p3""> I like to think I learned a lot from that experience and Wynton, just as he did from working with the great jazz drummer Art Blakey who learned from  the legendary pianist Mary Lou Williams. If you are not familiar with any of these name please google them, it is part of your history as a soulful human being.</p>
<p class=""p3""> I think one of the most valuable lessons among many was that people determined to do something together and negotiate the changes while maintaining their distinct individual personalities makes for the creation of incredible and remarkable things. Jazzaponics seeks to take that idea and create on localized levels around the world which are connected by this principle</p>
<p class=""p3"">Jazzaponics is our turn to pay it forward and let the younger generation have a chance at life on a stable planet,  and let others  know these kind of people(insightful jazz musicians, natraopaths, permaculturists) and learn from them and be part of a global community where we all negotiate collectively while maintaining our individuality. While doing something together no matter what race, nationality, age, orientation, creed, or religion.</p>
<p class=""p1"">That really is the Jazzaponics project at it's core. Everyone is welcome as long as they take the responsibility to really want to participate. </p>
<p class=""p1""> We hope you do in any way you can. We'll all be happy to see you</p>

<p class=""p1"">Some people just can’t contribute, but that doesn’t mean they can’t help:</p>
<p class=""p1"">Please get the word out and make some noise about our campaign.</p>
<p class=""p3"">Please use the Indiegogo share tools!</p>
<p class=""p2"">There are vacant lots and empty buildings all over America that could be grow food and creating jobs with the Jazzaponics project. I you know of a location that would benefit from being a facility in this project please let us know.</p></div>","Short Summary
Please watch the short video above first.
We are taking a 60 ft by 100 vacant lot in Clinton Hill Brooklyn and rapidly transforming it into a high yield urban farming facility using Aquaponics(a symbiotic relationship between plants and food). The facility will also serve as a training place to teach attendees the natural disciplines (growing their own food, herbal healthcare, easy localized energy production, and a host of other things.
Last but not least it will also serve as a nightly venue in which Jazz musicians (both world famous and up and coming will perform.
This first prototype is the blueprint for a rapidly constructed kit that we plan to replicate throughout NYC, the USA and Europe, and beyond thus creating a global network of urban food production facilities and jazz club in which all participants are guaranteed healthy food, preventative herbal healthcare, and proper wages.
 This prototype facility requires 137K to be built. It will take 6 weeks. Facilities after that will cost a fraction of this and will be assembled extremely faster.
Full Overview Summary
Hey. My name is Malachi ""Mike"" Basden. I am a soprano saxophonist, audio-visual performance artist; animator and illustrator who is also passionate about sustainability, especially in the difficult times we live in. I am also a certified earthen builder and have taught workshops around the world. My background in the sustainable movement and natural disciplines includes permaculture, aquaponics and alternate natural energy. I've also invented and designed a few things along the way to aid us all to move “off the grid”. In addition, I have worked as an animator on films, TV and have a few interesting and funny interactive/video games coming out later this year.
The Jazzaponics project pretty much combines all that stuff into one important project that will benefit all of us with a lot of fun along the way.

AMIE Refuge is a self-sustaining teaching farm that will provide respite and a temporary home for communities displaced by war, natural disaster, famine or persecution for the duration of their one-year refugee visas.     Participants receive access to healthcare, education, and skills training while at the Virginia refuge, and repatriate to rebuild their homeland with AMIE's continued support in the form of volunteers, aid, and an ongoing relationship with former residents.  DURING THE YEAR AT AMIE COMMUNITY REFUGE:

HEALING – Participants have time to heal from their physical, mental and spiritual trauma while having basic needs met and access to all the resources necessary to live in dignity and with security, including access to healthcare & counseling.  
 TRAINING – Public educators, community colleges, and individual lecturers will provide curriculum tailored to the needs of the group’s home region, to include nursing, education/teaching, infrastructure, agriculture/ livestock management, and engineering/construction. Participants live on a self-sustaining, teaching farm, practicing the model.   
EMPOWERMENT – Participants will educate us on their needs for rebuilding. Access to counseling and expertise in identifying and combating the community’s most pressing needs gives them the tools to prepare for reconstruction.   
 
AFTER A YEAR AT AMIE COMMUNITY REFUGE:   
 
REPATRIATION – Participants prepare for voluntary repatriation, gathering resources, supplies and the necessary skills to return to their homeland at the program’s conclusion, to aid in the achievement of their goals. (In cases where the homeland is not yet stable, or an individual decides not to Repatriate, Amie will provide Resettlement assistance.)   
REBUILDING – Amie provides continued support to the community after repatriation in the form of an accompanying, volunteer-based Repatriation Team, supplies, and ongoing training through frequent communication. Participants spread safe, sustainable peace-building practices through their recently-unstable regions.

She was absolutely the sweetest, most beautiful darling baby girl and her life was sadly cut too short but the memories will live on for a lifetime.

All donations will be going directly to funeral costs, cremation, and helping the family get back on their feet in the next couple of months. Any remainder will be given to the other two young children.

<p>Beware! Halloween is coming! That means the Butcher of Thatcher Court is looking for his next victims! For years, the Butcher has been opening his doors, waiting for unsuspecting victims to fall into his trap! This year, the Butcher and his family of vicious maniacs have moved to Honolulu, scarier and HUNGRIER than ever before!</p>
<p>Come if you dare! Escape if you can! It's A NIGHTMARE ON THATCHER COURT!</p>

<h3>Who We Are</h3>
<div>
<p>My name is Anthony.  I am a sailor in the United States Navy, and a Halloween nut!  In 2012, my wife, Natali, and I began home-haunting for trick-or-treaters.  We started with the 'Garage of Evil' in a 12'x20' garage and worked our hardest to scare the wits out of our visitors!  Now, we are expanding throughout our house, and this time we are haunting for a good cause!   In coordination with Operation Homefront, we are making this haunt bigger and better than ever!  <span><br/></span></p>
<p>Our partner, Operation Homefront, is a charity that offers support for military members and their families in times of difficulty.  They work ceaselessly to offer financial, food, and repairs assistance; and to help the families of our service members and Wounded Warriors.</p>
</div>
<br/>
</div> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>Home haunting is expensive!  Although we have partnered with Operation Homefront, we are paying for all supplies, equipment, props, makeup, costumes, and everything else!  We denied financial support from them in order to receive all proceeds from our event.  That's why we're turning to INDIEGOGO to help crowdfund for the event.</p>
<p>We plan, build, and setup all elements of our haunts, so we'll be using any funds through INDIEGOGO to make the haunt the best it can be!  </p>

</div></div>","Beware! Halloween is coming! That means the Butcher of Thatcher Court is looking for his next victims! For years, the Butcher has been opening his doors, waiting for unsuspecting victims to fall into his trap! This year, the Butcher and his family of vicious maniacs have moved to Honolulu, scarier and HUNGRIER than ever before!
Come if you dare! Escape if you can! It's A NIGHTMARE ON THATCHER COURT!


Who We Are

My name is Anthony.  I am a sailor in the United States Navy, and a Halloween nut!  In 2012, my wife, Natali, and I began home-haunting for trick-or-treaters.  We started with the 'Garage of Evil' in a 12'x20' garage and worked our hardest to scare the wits out of our visitors!  Now, we are expanding throughout our house, and this time we are haunting for a good cause!   In coordination with Operation Homefront, we are making this haunt bigger and better than ever!  
Our partner, Operation Homefront, is a charity that offers support for military members and their families in times of difficulty.  They work ceaselessly to offer financial, food, and repairs assistance; and to help the families of our service members and Wounded Warriors.


   What We Need & What You Get Home haunting is expensive!  Although we have partnered with Operation Homefront, we are paying for all supplies, equipment, props, makeup, costumes, and everything else!  We denied financial support from them in order to receive all proceeds from our event.  That's why we're turning to INDIEGOGO to help crowdfund for the event.
We plan, build, and setup all elements of our haunts, so we'll be using any funds through INDIEGOGO to make the haunt the best it can be!  


  The Impact As a military member, I know what it means to fall on hard times while serving our nation.  However, Operation Homefront is there to help out.  They have helped countless military members and their families all over the country.  It's a great feeling.  To get RELIEF during a crisis, a place to RECOVER if you need it and a little bit of RECOGNITION for a life of sacrifice.  That's what they do at Operation Homefront... and it's making a difference.

<h3>What Americorps is...</h3>Americorps is a federal government funding program given to non-profit organizations to help fund their programs around the country and around the world.  Hope Worldwide has been awarded an Americorps grant to help fund their summer Americorps internships.  This grant is not much money but is enough to award its members an education award and a small living stipend while they are working for the program.   Hope world wide is currently running three Americorps summer programs; one in Anchorage, AK, one in New Orleans, LA, and one in Philadelphia, PA.  These locations all host special programs to serve the biggest needs in those communities.  It is my strong conviction that this program is incredibly rewarding and valuable to all those who participate.  Recently the Americorps program was almost voted out of existence by our nation's representatives, but thanks to those of us who heard about this atrocity and called in to our state representatives the program was saved for another year.  This program as well as HOPE Worldwide has been a large part of my life over the past few years and has thus become my passion and my career ambition.<br/><br/>
</div><div>
<h3>What I am asking...</h3>
<br/>This summer I have been given the opportunity to serve on Americorps as a Staff Member, first in Philadelphia and later in Anchorage, AK.  This is an 8 week internship that spans from June 1st to August 1st.  Due to the rising costs of airfare I am soliciting donations to help get me to philly, back home for my sister's college graduation, back to Philly for the rest of my stay there and then my flight home to Los Angeles from Anchorage after the program is over.  The cost for all of this traveling is about $875.  I am hoping to raise $500 to fund this and the rest my parents have agreed to pay for.  Now this amount is a minimum, if I can raise more I will, but just to get to $500 would be great.  And if you think about it, that is only 25 people donating $20 each...or vice versa..But please donate whatever you can to help me attend this life changing experience. I thank all of you.<br/><br/>Kyle Winje<br/>

INFARM has partnered with Stockholm design group, <a href=""http://www.tomorrowmachine.se/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Tomorrow Machine</a>, to develop a never-before-seen microgreen growing kit. This innovative, playful kit is the first step in growing your own food. The kit comes with all you need to start growing microgreens, complete with:<ul>
<li>A PP foldable green-house (completely recyclable!)</li>
<li>Agar agar powder to create a gel-based growing medium </li>
<li>3 varieties of organic seeds - peppery rucola, crunchy mustard and spicy radish</li>

<li>Inspired by the ancient art of origami, the kit folds into a mini-greenhouse.</li>
<li>It is made from a transparent waterproof material that allows one to watch the entire growing process.</li>
<li>The seeds are spread over seaweed based agar agar gel</li>
<li>It takes 3 days in the dark for the seeds to sprout</li>

<h2>About Microgreens<br/>
</h2>
Microgreens are a tiny form of young edible greens produced from various kinds of vegetables. Microgreens are distinguished from sprouts, which are younger and grown in the dark.<p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/586786/files/20140518012045-p_infarm_microgreens_02_road.png?1400401245"" src="""" style=""""/></p>The average crop-time for most microgreens is 7-14 days from seeding to harvest. Microgreens offer the highest concentration of vitamins and nutrients, up to 40 times more than mature plants.They have intense flavor and aroma and taste like the fully grown plants.<span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;""><p style=""margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 15px; margin-left: 0px;""></p>

We are now working hard to get the kits right to your door. Feel free to email us with any questions: info@infarm.de.We set a new goal of €25,000 so we can give back a little extra to all our funders.  Support us and receive LIMITED EDITION seeds - a mix of several types of seeds so you can explore the whole range of microgreen colors and flavors. We will also give each of you a RECIPE BOOKLET so you can prepare enticing recipes with your home-grown microgreens!Q&A: Many of your have asked some interesting questions about the Microgarden and seeds. We are answering all your questions right below under YOUR SUPPORT.The indoor farming movement has begun. No longer is the idea of growing fresh produce in your home a futuristic concept. Based in the heart of Berlin, INFARM is a farming incubator that aims to provide urban communities with the freedom to grow fresh, local, organic produce, no matter the season, right at home.
Activities:

An indoor farm growing non-GMO, chemical-free herbs, vegetables and microgreens

Lectures, workshops and experiments that demonstrate how indoor farming can provide cost-effective and eco-friendly nutrition for all

Microgarden - a kit for growing microgreens at home
A farm-to-table supper club featuring produce from the indoor farm
Customized indoor growing systems designed to suit varied needs


""A truly avant-garde design that is bringing us closer to a better future.""Werner Aisslinger, Studio Aisslinger

Microgarden
INFARM has partnered with Stockholm design group, Tomorrow Machine, to develop a never-before-seen microgreen growing kit. This innovative, playful kit is the first step in growing your own food. The kit comes with all you need to start growing microgreens, complete with:
A PP foldable green-house (completely recyclable!)
Agar agar powder to create a gel-based growing medium 
3 varieties of organic seeds - peppery rucola, crunchy mustard and spicy radish
Instructions



Inspired by the ancient art of origami, the kit folds into a mini-greenhouse.
It is made from a transparent waterproof material that allows one to watch the entire growing process.
The seeds are spread over seaweed based agar agar gel
It takes 3 days in the dark for the seeds to sprout
Another week in the light and the microgreens are ready to eat without watering even once!
And the best part? You can do it over and over again.

""InFarm has a very creative and innovative approach to food sustainability on a community level.""James Griffiths, Swiss-based sustainability expert

About Microgreens

Microgreens are a tiny form of young edible greens produced from various kinds of vegetables. Microgreens are distinguished from sprouts, which are younger and grown in the dark.The average crop-time for most microgreens is 7-14 days from seeding to harvest. Microgreens offer the highest concentration of vitamins and nutrients, up to 40 times more than mature plants.They have intense flavor and aroma and taste like the fully grown plants.
Workshops, Lectures & ExperimentsWe believe it is important to share information. Over the years we have gained a wealth of knowledge and experience which we want to share with our community. At the INFARM warehouse, we are hosting weekly workshops touching on relevant topics such as:



Transforming Passive Consumers to Active Producers - Why and how we must decentralize the food systems

Soil less Cultivation - A detailed look into hydroponic designs

Flavor, Color, Nutrition - How growing your own can mean better products and better meals

Eventually, the content developed for workshops will be translated into INFARM Online, allowing access to this information for all.During the campaign, we will be hosting a series of workshops in our Berlin warehouse. Check our Facebook page for updates: www.facebook.com/infarm.
Indoor Growing SystemsBe the first to own a customized indoor growing system designed to suit your varied needs. We will consult, design and implement the system tailored to the location you choose (home, office, restaurant, hotel etc.) which are designed to fit seamlessly in with existing interior design/architecture. To ensure best results, we will provide technical support and training on how to maintain the system.INFARM's customized growing system made for 25hours Hotel BerlinEvery growing system will include:

Growing chamber for 40-50 plants (a variety of herbs, salad, roots)

<p>My husband and I founded Little D’s in February 2012. Our baby carriers are affordable, completely unique and beautifully hand crafted.</p>
<p>Our line of carriers includes a signature series that features humorous phrases that celebrate the babywearing movement and a baby anatomy collection that features artistic images that display the correct carrying position for baby a stretchy wrap.</p>
<p><img alt=""Little D's table"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/460012/pictures/full/20120925173629-Toronto-20120421-00212.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: left; margin: 0px 15px;""/>We sell our carriers at local baby, trade and craft shows.  Our carriers are also available at a handful of local retailers.  Our monthly sales have allowed us to cover our start-up costs and expenses, and now we are looking for funding that will allow our expansion with an international distributor.</p>
<p>It is really important to us that our carriers continue to be made by real, hard-working people in North America. Many of our competitors have their products made in other countries where labor is less expensive than Canada and the United states, but we don't want to take jobs out of the economy, we want to make jobs. </p>

<h3><strong>What is the baby wearing movement?</strong></h3>
<p>Baby wearing is the act of putting your baby in a carrier on your body, like a garment. This allows parents to go on with their daily tasks while being assured of their baby's security and continue responding to her needs.</p>
<p>Being carried offers a baby movement, pleasure, warmth, security and sounds that are similar to those of the womb. The movements of the mother and the sound of her heart stimulate the baby's nervous system.</p>
<p>A wrap style carrier is comfortable for the parents, because it adequately distributes the weight across the shoulders, back and hips. There are no bands that dig into the skin. All this allows parents to carry babies for longer periods without tiring.</p>
<p>Wearing your baby is fun. Wraps attract attention, initiate conversations and encourage communication. And there's nothing like the feeling of having your baby cuddled up to you.</p>
<p>Little D’s believes that babywearing is an unstoppable movement that every family should be able to participate in.</p>

<p><strong>Babywearing contributes to happier, healthier and smarter babies</strong></p>
<p>Wearing your baby for 3 hours per day reduces crying significantly - 43% less overall and 54% less during evening hours. Carrying helps you and your baby to communicate better. Parents that carry their babies interpret the signals of their babies more efficiently, and carried babies get quickly used to facial expressions and voice of the adult carrying them. A study at Columbia University compared the levels of attachment of babies carried in a baby carrier vs. babies carried in a car seat. Results indicated that, at 13 months old, babies who were carried in wearable carriers were significantly more likely to demonstrate a strong and secure attachment to their mothers. Thus, carried children cry less because their needs are met immediately, which reinforces attachment and a sense of self-confidence in parents, who know that they have a sure way of satisfying their baby.</p>
<p>Studies have shown that baby wearing is linked to lowering the incidence of SIDS (sudden infant death syndrome) and behavioural disorders. Close physical contact between parent and child stimulates neurobiological connections in newborns. Babies gain weight faster, have better motor skills, coordination, increased muscle tone, and sense of balance. Carrying, especially in a tightly-held vertical position, aids baby's digestion. When babies start wanting to sit, the wrap allows them to do so, keeping their legs spread in a natural angle. Thus, their legs are not forced to be kept straight while their hips are still forming.</p>
<p>Babies pushed in strollers or lugged around in car seats only get to see the adult world at knee level. Carried babies get a better view of the world by allowing babies to be at face level with adults and their activities. This reassures children and allows them to harmoniously learn about their environment.</p>
<p>Carried babies are very sociable and calm because they are physically closer to people and intimately involved in their caregiver's environment. According to Dr. Sears, ""baby becomes aware of, and learns from, all the subtle facial expressions, body language, voice inflections and tones, breathing patterns and emotions of the caregiver."" Babies are exposed to the all the aspects of being human through their caregiver, increasing social development.</p>
<p>Babies in a content and safe environment are able to be more alert and aware of their surroundings, providing the perfect environment for learning. This also provides the parent with an opportunity for increased interaction and bonding time with their baby. Carried babies are able to learn language more quickly since they are positioned at voice and eye level. They become more involved in conversations and begin to learn how to listen.</p>
<h3><strong>Less expensive baby, happier and healthier family</strong></h3>
<p>Wrap carriers cost less than strollers, commercial baby carriers or soft-shelled carriers, and they can be used just about every day for 2-3 years. Bringing your little one along for the ride saves you the cost of childcare.</p>
<p>Baby wearing is convenient - nothing is more awkward than carrying a heavy plastic car seat with one arm. Baby wearing allows you to safely move about with your baby regardless of terrain - you can stroll down uneven sidewalks, narrow lanes, walk up stairs, or climb mountains. Carrying baby enables the caregiver to have both hands free. Caregivers have the freedom to care for other children while carrying their baby close (Sears). A father who participates in baby wearing can actually soothe a fussy baby. Fathers can hold babies close and talk, hum or sing which is calming to babies.</p>
<p>Lactating mothers will lose less bone mass by carrying with them the extra weight of their baby, thus increasing physical fitness. Prolactin and oxytocin levels in the mother are increased through contact with baby, which leads to easier breastfeeding, more responsible mothering and a more secure maternal bond. Additionally these hormones inhibit the negative impact of stress on the mother.</p>

My husband and I founded Little D’s in February 2012. Our baby carriers are affordable, completely unique and beautifully hand crafted.
Our line of carriers includes a signature series that features humorous phrases that celebrate the babywearing movement and a baby anatomy collection that features artistic images that display the correct carrying position for baby a stretchy wrap.
We sell our carriers at local baby, trade and craft shows.  Our carriers are also available at a handful of local retailers.  Our monthly sales have allowed us to cover our start-up costs and expenses, and now we are looking for funding that will allow our expansion with an international distributor.
It is really important to us that our carriers continue to be made by real, hard-working people in North America. Many of our competitors have their products made in other countries where labor is less expensive than Canada and the United states, but we don't want to take jobs out of the economy, we want to make jobs. 
We want to turn Little D's baby carriers into a full-time business that will allow us to increase our production volume from hundreds of carriers a month to thousands.  We hope that our brand will become synonymous with babywearing all over the world and that one day people will consider Little D's stretchy wrap baby carriers an essential product for every new parent.    
Help us to turn Little D’s Baby Carriers into an international brand so that we can offer our carriers to more families, help to promote babywearing around the world, contribute to a stable North American economy, and build a stable financial future for our own little D. 
We take pride in our product and support all forms of safe babywearing.  You can learn more about our products at our online store, www.littleds.ca.

<h3>Stump Speech.</h3>Fellowship Church exists to connect and lead people into a growing relationship with Jesus Christ.  We will do this by being generous with our resources beyond the walls of our church facilities, so that we can turn our communities into family.<br/><br/>We are a movement, not shackled to tradition or institution.  We will be known for being the church in our local communities and not just a church that people attend. Being a church that is focused on reaching the community will allow us to serve 100's and 1000's of people who would otherwise never be reached with the life changing message of Jesus.<h3>Fellowship Is On The Move.</h3>
<p>We believe that moving our facilities to a well known, highly visible, easily accessible, and central location, like Showcase North; will bring positive change to our church, our communities, and ultimately the people that we are trying to reach.  </p>

<p>In Africa, the ""hungry continent"", food crops are under pressure to be used for  production of biodiesel because the continent is in need of <b>energy and food</b>.  It could be said that any fuel ultimately replaced by waste oil represents food that will feed a hungry African mouth.  From this point of view, the goal is to feed people.</p>

While there are plenty of outdoor activities for high-energy kids during the summer, we feel that local businesses providing indoor activities are sorely lacking.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Burnout Brooklyn is a proposed 20,000 square foot indoor multi-activity play space to be situated in the popular neighborhood of Redhook, Brooklyn. Catering to children from birth to 12 years of age, our play center will include a state of the art adventure playground complex, slides, ball pits, a toddler and baby area, a 20' indoor rock wall, a video arcade and cafeteria and an indoor skateboard park.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>We're fortunate to have a very experienced backer for the project. Our business partners, House of Play from the UK have over 20 years experience designing and building play centers for independent operators all over the world. Using their expertise and business know-how, and with <strong>'Astrabound'</strong> <span>their very popular 14,000 sq foot showcase facility in England as a model, we aim to make Burnout Brooklyn the premiere indoor play space for young families in Brooklyn and Manhattan.</span></p>
<p>This is <strong>Astrabound</strong>:</p>
<p><a href=""http://www.astrabound.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.astrabound.com</a></p>
<p>We've also been approached by 'The Fun Factory' (also in the UK) who have agreed to act as consultants in the project:</p>
<p><a href=""http://www.funfactoryrochford.co.uk/take-the-tour/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.funfactoryrochford.co.uk/take-the-tour/</a></p>
<p> </p>
<p><img alt=""Play equipment int"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://burnoutbrooklyn.com/docs/astrabound.png"" src="""" style="""" title=""Play equipment int""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>We are currently in discussions with several property owners in Redhook. Developers are very interested in viable projects that will add value to the neighborhood, encourage visitors to the area and add much-needed services to the community. But housing a business like Burnout Brooklyn will require substantial development. Property owners will only invest capital in the project if we can prove it is financially viable and has substantial community support.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>So the goal of this campaign is twofold: </p>
<p>1. to raise seed capital to pay the professional fees we need to develop our plans for the facility</p>
<p>2. to show property owners, developers and investors how much community interest there is in a business like Burnout Brooklyn.</p>
<p>Our business plan and cash-flow forecast already show that Burnout Brooklyn will rapidly become a very profitable venture. Feedback from advisors and prospective Venture Capital investors has been very positive. But to move our plans to the next level, we need funds.</p>
<p>Our total estimated startup costs for the play center are around $1,300,000. But given the intricacies of New York City planning permission and regulations, we're not going to be in a position to begin construction for at least another year. But we already have expenses to pay and it's not been easy getting this far. We need the services of designers, researchers, lawyers and business consultants.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>We've set a modest goal of $40,000 for our seed capital, which will allow us to develop our plans for the next 12 months and secure investment for the construction.</p>

Our business partners, House of Play from the UK have over 20 years experience designing and building play centers for independent operators all over the world. Using their expertise and business know-how, and with 'Astrabound' their very popular 14,000 sq foot showcase facility in England as a model, we aim to make Burnout Brooklyn the premiere indoor play space for young families in Brooklyn and Manhattan.
This is Astrabound:
http://www.astrabound.com
We've also been approached by 'The Fun Factory' (also in the UK) who have agreed to act as consultants in the project:
http://www.funfactoryrochford.co.uk/take-the-tour/
 

 
We are currently in discussions with several property owners in Redhook. Developers are very interested in viable projects that will add value to the neighborhood, encourage visitors to the area and add much-needed services to the community. But housing a business like Burnout Brooklyn will require substantial development. Property owners will only invest capital in the project if we can prove it is financially viable and has substantial community support.
 
So the goal of this campaign is twofold: 
1. to raise seed capital to pay the professional fees we need to develop our plans for the facility
2. to show property owners, developers and investors how much community interest there is in a business like Burnout Brooklyn.
Our business plan and cash-flow forecast already show that Burnout Brooklyn will rapidly become a very profitable venture. Feedback from advisors and prospective Venture Capital investors has been very positive. But to move our plans to the next level, we need funds.
Our total estimated startup costs for the play center are around $1,300,000. But given the intricacies of New York City planning permission and regulations, we're not going to be in a position to begin construction for at least another year. But we already have expenses to pay and it's not been easy getting this far. We need the services of designers, researchers, lawyers and business consultants.
 
We've set a modest goal of $40,000 for our seed capital, which will allow us to develop our plans for the next 12 months and secure investment for the construction.

Even being able to go and visit family or friends when they want to. Many families that have special needs children are unable to take their children to do these type of events because they don't have, or cant afford the proper transportation needed to transport their child.

<p>Hello.
I am Shelley L. Houston, author, president, and founder of Just Dust
Publishers, an independent Christian* publishing company. In 2011,
Just Dust Publishers (JDP) published its first book, my novel, <i>Julia,
Coming Home</i>.
There are now 500 copies in print. <br/><img class=""product-image lazy"" data-src=""http://justdustpublishers.com/uploads/3/4/6/5/3465059/1101994.jpg?164?7573825"" src="""" style=""""/><br/>We also have published books for
other authors who want to self publish--books of high quality,
beautifully written and designed, that are in line with the company
goal, ""<i>To
Publish Books of Redemption</i>."" These books bring to life people's stories-- some fiction, some not.</p>
<p>
In March of this
year, I decided to expand the company.  JDP will still obtain
and publish works of unique merit, but in our new business model, JDP
will not only service self-publishing authors, but truly publish
(fund, print, and market) books in circles much larger than
previously reached. 
</p>
<p>
JDP now has four
authors under contract to have books out this fall. To bring their
books to print and to promote these books will take more capital.
That's where you come in.</p>

""Christian"" I refer to being a follower of Jesus Christ,
not a representation of any one denomination nor political party.</i></p>
<p></p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p></p>
<p>
We need $20,000 to
supplement company capital. With that, we will take on four very
different publishing projects and bring them to
full-market exposure. Further, we plan to use profits earned from
these books to publish at least eight books of the same caliber in
the next calendar year.

of those books.

<h3>Double D's Bartending Services </h3>
<h3><br/></h3>
<p> My name is LaToya and I am the founder of Double D's Bartending Services, LLC. My sister and I are both certified mixologist and came up with this crazy idea of starting a mobile bartending service. How exciting is this industry! We want to create a fun yet professional service catering to private parties/events.  <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;""> </span></p>
<p>Double D's represents my sister and I middle name, (I wonder why everyone giggles at the name... lol).  Being excited about this newly found opportunity we began networking and meeting people in this line of work and expanding our network of bartenders.  All of the bartenders we work with are certified and trained with over 200 of the most popular drinks! We began to service small parties and have received great feedback, especially for our personalities and alcohol monitoring.</p>
<p>This campaign is important to us and what we are building because it allows us to utilize our skills in this specialized industry. It allows us to employ new and seasoned bartenders even flair bartenders, We want customers to enjoy their parties without worrying about alcohol consumption or overly intoxicated guests. Lastly, the rate of deaths from drunk driving is increasing and we want to help reduce those numbers. </p>
<p>YOU will help Double D's  achieve our goals of getting the business up and running smoothly with your support. By extent, You will help us achieve our goals by attracting new customer and/or become a customer and helping us reduce drunk driving deaths..thus growing our business. </p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>In order for our business to be successful, the following is very important:</p>
<p><b>Working Capital/Payroll</b></p>
<p>Small businesses provides new jobs! We are looking to employed part-time or per diem bartenders in the Atlanta Ga area as well as Jacksonville FL and surrounding areas. </p>
<p>Estimated cost $20,000</p>
<p><b>Retainer Fee for Business Attorney  </b></p>
<p>Every business owner that I have met have stressed to me the importance of having a business attorney. One business owner and a mentor of mine advised me that It's cheaper to hire a business attorney in the beginning stages of your business; to ensure all legalities of starting a business are done properly vs hiring a business attorney when damages has been done and you are being sued. Most business fail within the first year due to lack of experience, improper planning and legal issues. We clearly see the need for a business attorney and the benefits of investing in one especially in a business where alcohol consumption is involved. The retainer fee $5,000 will cover costs of any contract drafted for clientele/vendors/subcontractors, as well as any other legal documents.</p>
<p><b>Customized Portable Bars</b></p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">What better way to distinguish Double D's Bartending Services from the rest than to have a customized portable bar.  Not only is it great for marketing but the professional appearance and customized LED light of the portable bar will make any event pop and the bartender easier to locate (for larger crowds), Each of our employed bartenders</span> will have 24 hour access to the bars. This will ensure that our bartenders will be ready and on time all the time. Having a portable bar allows our bartenders to set up/clean up quickly which would allow more time to serve guests. Estimated cost $4,200 and 5 are needed.</p>
<p><b>Virtual Office </b></p>
<p>Owning and operating a mobile bartending business is considered a home-based business in Ga. In order for me to get a permit (Dekalb county requirement) I need a business address. Renting a building that I would NEVER need would be very costly and unnecessary. I came across virtual offices that would allow me to use the physical address as my business address for registration of my business and for meeting/conferences. Estimated cost $3000 </p>
<p><b>Marketing</b></p>
<p>I believe we can all agree that aside from 'word of mouth', websites are by far the most important tool for marketing. We live in an age that if a business doesn't have a website we question it authenticity. AND if the website looks cheaply/poorly done we will avoid clicking on any links right? </p>
<p>Double D's Bartending Services will have a website that will showcase our services, core values, preferred client list, sponsors and professionalism. The website would give customers the opportunity to view available dates for booking with the ability to pay at booking. The website would allow you to view upcoming charity events in which Double D's Bartending Services would be apart of and much much more.</p>
<p>Aside from online marketing, this is still a need for the standard marketing; to reach those who do not have access to internet.  Estimated cost $8,000</p>
<p><b>Insurance</b> </p>
<p>Every business needs to be insured.  Double D's believe that every event should be enjoyable yet in a responsible manner. Our bartenders are highly trained in cutting off drinkers professional. We want our customers to party hard but party responsible. Also, being certified and insured gives clients/customers a peace of mind and coverage for the unexpected. Estimated cost $2000</p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>How much of an impact can a mobile bartending business have on the community?</p>

 My name is LaToya and I am the founder of Double D's Bartending Services, LLC. My sister and I are both certified mixologist and came up with this crazy idea of starting a mobile bartending service. How exciting is this industry! We want to create a fun yet professional service catering to private parties/events.   
Double D's represents my sister and I middle name, (I wonder why everyone giggles at the name... lol).  Being excited about this newly found opportunity we began networking and meeting people in this line of work and expanding our network of bartenders.  All of the bartenders we work with are certified and trained with over 200 of the most popular drinks! We began to service small parties and have received great feedback, especially for our personalities and alcohol monitoring.
This campaign is important to us and what we are building because it allows us to utilize our skills in this specialized industry. It allows us to employ new and seasoned bartenders even flair bartenders, We want customers to enjoy their parties without worrying about alcohol consumption or overly intoxicated guests. Lastly, the rate of deaths from drunk driving is increasing and we want to help reduce those numbers. 
YOU will help Double D's  achieve our goals of getting the business up and running smoothly with your support. By extent, You will help us achieve our goals by attracting new customer and/or become a customer and helping us reduce drunk driving deaths..thus growing our business. 
What We Need & What You Get
In order for our business to be successful, the following is very important:
Working Capital/Payroll
Small businesses provides new jobs! We are looking to employed part-time or per diem bartenders in the Atlanta Ga area as well as Jacksonville FL and surrounding areas. 
Estimated cost $20,000
Retainer Fee for Business Attorney  
Every business owner that I have met have stressed to me the importance of having a business attorney. One business owner and a mentor of mine advised me that It's cheaper to hire a business attorney in the beginning stages of your business; to ensure all legalities of starting a business are done properly vs hiring a business attorney when damages has been done and you are being sued. Most business fail within the first year due to lack of experience, improper planning and legal issues. We clearly see the need for a business attorney and the benefits of investing in one especially in a business where alcohol consumption is involved. The retainer fee $5,000 will cover costs of any contract drafted for clientele/vendors/subcontractors, as well as any other legal documents.
Customized Portable Bars
What better way to distinguish Double D's Bartending Services from the rest than to have a customized portable bar.  Not only is it great for marketing but the professional appearance and customized LED light of the portable bar will make any event pop and the bartender easier to locate (for larger crowds), Each of our employed bartenders will have 24 hour access to the bars. This will ensure that our bartenders will be ready and on time all the time. Having a portable bar allows our bartenders to set up/clean up quickly which would allow more time to serve guests. Estimated cost $4,200 and 5 are needed.
Virtual Office 
Owning and operating a mobile bartending business is considered a home-based business in Ga. In order for me to get a permit (Dekalb county requirement) I need a business address. Renting a building that I would NEVER need would be very costly and unnecessary. I came across virtual offices that would allow me to use the physical address as my business address for registration of my business and for meeting/conferences. Estimated cost $3000 
Marketing
I believe we can all agree that aside from 'word of mouth', websites are by far the most important tool for marketing. We live in an age that if a business doesn't have a website we question it authenticity. AND if the website looks cheaply/poorly done we will avoid clicking on any links right? 
Double D's Bartending Services will have a website that will showcase our services, core values, preferred client list, sponsors and professionalism. The website would give customers the opportunity to view available dates for booking with the ability to pay at booking. The website would allow you to view upcoming charity events in which Double D's Bartending Services would be apart of and much much more.
Aside from online marketing, this is still a need for the standard marketing; to reach those who do not have access to internet.  Estimated cost $8,000
Insurance 
Every business needs to be insured.  Double D's believe that every event should be enjoyable yet in a responsible manner. Our bartenders are highly trained in cutting off drinkers professional. We want our customers to party hard but party responsible. Also, being certified and insured gives clients/customers a peace of mind and coverage for the unexpected. Estimated cost $2000
The Impact
How much of an impact can a mobile bartending business have on the community?
Small businesses brings new employment opportunities. We have several independent contracted bartenders that are certified and trained, however, they do not qualify for benefits. We would like to employ more bartenders permanently and as stated above, a portion of your contribution will be used towards payroll. This will allow more bartenders to receive benefits.
Double D's Bartending Services promote the consumption of alcohol regardless of what time of the day. However, we believe that you should party hard party responsibly. That simply means; we want you to enjoy what you are celebrating without the worries of friends/family..etc becoming overly intoxicated.  According to MADD.ORG, every 53 mins someone is killed by a drunk driver. We are skilled at recognizing individuals who have reached their limit and know how to cut them off politely and discretely.  In turn, we can possibly reduce the rate of death from drunk drivers! 
The use of a certified mixologist is greatly encouraged for all events that will serve alcohol. Lastly, we are always looking for ways to help out in the community. Double D's Bartending Services will also be available for charity events booking.

Everything in our store comes from local farmers and artisans from within 100 miles of our front door. All of our now 30+ participating farmers/artisans are committed to organic growing principles and raising livestock in a humane, natural environment. </p>
<p>We chose to open our shop in the historic Harrisburg-West End Neighborhood, near downtown Augusta to bring fresh, local produce to an under-served, inner-city neighborhood rich in history and a strong sense of community identity. The Harrisburg community was once a place to fear, but with the help of involved residents, community leaders, non-profits, and local food supporters, it is beginning to reclaim its charm and beauty. Our family believes so strongly in the revitalization of Harrisburg that one of our own even moved into the neighborhood to be our eyes and ears on the ground, as it were.</p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">We opened our doors in November, 2013, through a combined effort of over a dozen farmers (and a whole lot of prayers.) You can read more about us here:</span></p>

</ul>
<div><b>What are we doing?</b></div>
<ul>
<li><span style=""background-color: initial;"">In June, 2014, we launched our multi-farm CSA program, offering full and half share baskets of fresh, local, organically grown produce to members all over the CSRA (Central Savannah River Area.)</span></li> <li>Starting with the November-December season, we are offering a scholarship program so that families in the neighborhood can enjoy all our farmers have to offer, no matter their income.</li> </ul>
<p>From the first day our store opened, our mission has been to bring the beauty, wonder, and great food from local farms to every nook and cranny of the CSRA. Organic food should not be an elitist niche market. Good, clean food should be accessible and affordable for everyone. Our scholarship program aims to further our mission by including those who would otherwise never consider organic food as an affordable option in their good health. </p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need</h3> <p>Our growers are committed to leaving this world a better place - with good soil, clean water, and better quality of life for everyone. That commitment doesn't end with the food they harvest. When we first proposed a scholarship program for our CSA, several of our farmers jumped at the opportunity to bring the fruits (and veggies) of their labor to a worthwhile endeavor - offering to donate a portion of the produce needed to supply our scholarship baskets. </p>
<p>This seriously lowered the cost involved, making it possible to think we could raise the remaining funds from our community. </p> <ul>
<li>Thanks to our farmers (and other local food supporters) we can provide a half share basket each week to a family in need for just $50 a month - that's 5-7lbs (roughly 2 grocery bags, stuffed full) of fresh, organically grown, local produce each week. </li> <li>Raising $1,000 means we can provide scholarships to 5 families for FOUR months!!</li> <li>Even if we don't reach our goal of $1,000, every $50 we raise provides a half share basket to a local family in need for 4 weeks. Imagine what that could mean for the single mom trying to feed 2 or 3 kids on a minimum wage job, or the elderly couple struggling to get by on a limited income, or the young military family barely making it on an E4's salary.</li> </ul>
</div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>We have been so incredibly blessed since we opened our doors last year. The local food community has rallied around our little shop with their whole hearts. We are continually amazed by the love and support we have received, and the genuine difference our shop has made in the lives of our farmers, our supporters, and our surrounding neighborhood. </p>
<p>Ours is by no means the only effort in the Harrisburg community. Several local non-profits (including Augusta Locally Grown, Good Neighbor Ministries, St. Luke United Methodist Church, and others) have stepped up to the plate in an effort to improve the lives of those living in Harrisburg. Words simply cannot express the changes in our little neighborhood over the last 3 years, since local foods became a part of the Harrisburg scene. </p>
<p>There isn't enough room on this page to tell you all of the wonderful things going on - from Augusta Locally Grown's 100 Raised Beds project, to The Veggie Truck, to our store and our partnership with The Kroc Center across the street, to the Harrisburg-West End Neighborhood Association's plans to buy and renovate homes. To watch a community transform from drugs, bugs, and run-down houses to a vibrant, thriving community focused on healthy living is nothing short of miraculous. </p>
<p>But even with all of that, there are members of our community who are struggling. There are families still barely getting by, in spite of working hard and making the right choices. We have children in the neighborhood growing up on sugary box cereals and processed foods that offer little to no nutritional value. Prettying up the streets and improving the housing doesn't mean much if our residents aren't healthy enough to enjoy a vibrant life. </p>
<p>To clean up our neighborhood and make lasting changes, we have to start with the most basic of necessities -the food we eat. Cost, the hectic pace of life, lack of healthier options, and lack of knowledge - all of these things affect the choices our neighbors make. We firmly believe that to fix any community you have to start with the family dinner table. Imagine if our world still placed a high importance on eating dinner as a family, using real food, made from scratch, with love and appreciation. Imagine if the family dinner table were once again an American staple. We could fix so much more than just our broken food system. </p>
<ul></ul>
</div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>Our first challenge, when we conceived the idea of scholarship baskets, was finding families for whom our efforts could really make a difference. We didn't want to just hang a shingle and turn our store into a soup kitchen. But, at the same time, we don't have the man-power to screen families to find the ones we could truly help...the ones who can DO something, if someone just offered a little bit of a hand up. </p>
<p>Our second challenge was trying to ensure we weren't just making token efforts. Handing someone a little free food and walking away, in our eyes, isn't going to do much to change anything. BUT, if we could develop a program that allows us a more long-term relationship with just a few people/families...well, now. THAT could make a difference. </p>
<p>Enter one of our favorite Harrisburg advocates, Marsha Jones of St. Luke United Methodist Church. Marsha has worked tirelessly over the last few years to connect with residents in Harrisburg, to help where she can, support where she is needed, and help connect the dots between all of the groups and organizations working to better the Harrisburg community. Marsha graciously offered to identify families she knows in the community and help us develop our scholarship program so that it can be as sustainable as the crops our farmers tend. </p>

So instead of saying, ""What if I went online and hoped people would accept my offer to make things for them in exchange for money...."" My life has had way too many ""what if"" whims that became ""coulda,woulda, shoulda"" pangs, this idea is going into the ""trying it out"" column.
I have some things in ample supply, like yarn for instance. And time, I have a lot of free time. I don’t have a steady income right now, savings are depleted, and the job search is taking longer than expected. I bide my time tweaking my resume, looking for jobs to apply to, cat sitting and babysitting for a little cash, doing volunteer work and working on creative projects. It's so lonely though! I can sit home alone while my credit card debt compounds or you can ask me to make something for you. I'd much rather crochet someone a hat she wants or a write a silly haiku you'll smile at than add another page to my personal sketchbook of doodles right now. I really need to connect with people who aren't cats right now!

For the next four years, we slowly but surely developed the concept for a coffee shop that would center around great relationships all the way from farm to cup. </p><p></p><p>Then one day in late September, we were given an opportunity to open that coffee shop we'd been dreaming of. We knew it was the right time, we said yes, and things started moving- fast! </p>
<p>
</p><p>So, here we are. We’re going all in to make our dream a reality, but we need your help. <b>We need to raise $12,000 by December 15th. </b>If we don't reach our goal, we won't get a single dime, so please consider making a contribution! We're offering a plethora of great ""perks"" for our supporters, whether you give $1 or $1,000.

We want the few minutes (or hours) you spend at Source to be a high point in your day. We’ll start to make that happen from the minute you walk in the door. You’ll be welcomed into Source like you're part of the family, and we'll serve you the highest quality coffee, tea and baked goods prepared expertly and efficiently. If you have a train to catch at 7:00, we’ll make sure you’re in and out the door as quickly as possible. If you want to stay and chat about the farmers who grow our newest drip coffee offering, that’s great too.  </span></p><p><b>Ethical Sourcing. </b></p><p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">You can feel good knowing that each time you buy a cup of coffee at Source Coffeehouse you're taking a stand against exploitation in the coffee industry. You’ll know exactly where your cup of joe comes from because we are working with Crop to Cup Coffee, a company that has taken transparency and ethical trade to new heights through their relationship-driven business model. </span></p><p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">As they explain on their <a href=""http://www.croptocup.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">website</a>, <i>“Crop to Cup is an importer, broker and wholesaler of green and roasted relationship coffees from unique sources. We provide the supply chain tools for our customers to connect with their coffee and its origins, and build successful and sustainable coffee programs. We work closely with each community from whom we source coffee, and we choose expert partners in the fields of agronomy, logistics and roasting. To us and our customers, coffee is so much more than a commodity.”</i></span></p><p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">We are thrilled to be working with this company. You will love both their coffee and the great feeling you’ll get knowing that your money is going to real people being paid real, respectable wages for their work, all the way across the supply chain. </span><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">We're also committed to providing fair trade/organic whole leaf tea, and we will constantly seek to align our business practices and product line with our values. </span></p><p><b>Community Engagement. </b></p><p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Our vision is for Source to be actively involved in the community around us- from donating our used coffee grounds to local gardeners to hosting fundraising events for area nonprofits- we hope to become a part of the fabric of this community in a meaningful way. We want to do more than just serve you coffee; this is something we'll be intentional about this from day one. </span></p><p><b>Sustainability.</b></p><p>We take environmental stewardship seriously, and are working to do our part. From purchasing fully compostable paper products to encouraging reuse with our customized ""KeepCups"" and Green Card discount, we'll seek to minimize waste and make decisions that reflect our commitment to caring for the earth and the limited resources we've been entrusted with. </p><p><span style=""font-weight: normal;""></span></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/217481/files/20131122190235-21.jpg?1385175755"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><i>This is our soon-to-be storefront!

We’ve got the vision. We’ve got the space. We’ve got most of the equipment.

This would offset the cost of our ""perks"" and fees from PayPal and Indiegogo and allow us to use the full $12,000 towards our expenses. </p><p><b>Here's where the money will go: </b></p><p></p><ul>

Clicking on this button will bring you to the Contribution Check Out page. Once there, enter the amount of money you'd like to contribute and select your Perk! You'll then be led through a couple of quick steps to complete the transaction. <p></p><p>Please note that your credit card or PayPal account will be charged <em>immediately</em>, as soon as you complete your contribution check out process, not at the end of the campaign.

If you live out of town and would prefer we send you a bag of freshly roasted Crop to Cup coffee instead, just let us know! </b></p><p>First up we have these stickers. They're high quality vinyl with UV laminate- making them super durable and weather-safe! We added the ""Drink Local"" sticker for Small Business Saturday, and will be giving that to everyone who makes a donation of $5 or more! </p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/235329/files/20131201152310-sticker.png?1385940190"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p></p><p>Next up we have the KeepCup and our fabulous coffee. This is not the actual color scheme of OUR KeepCup (we're still working on that), but it shows you what a KeepCup is. It's a super fun alternative to paper cups. KeepCup is leading a movement in the coffee industry away from waste and towards reuse- and we are all about that! Every minute, over 1 million disposable cups are discarded in a landfill. YIKES! Let's do our part to stem the tide. You can choose your KeepCup to correspond with our small (8oz), medium (12oz) or large (16oz) drink sizes, and each time you use it, you'll get 10% off your drink! </p><p>And of course, there's the coffee. It's a 10oz bag of freshly roasted coffee. It comes with a postcard you can send to the farmers who helped grow it. It's delicious. </p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/235335/files/20131201152540-Fotor1201182153.png?1385940340"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p></p><p></p><p>And finally, we have our fair trade/organic cotton tote bag and t-shirt! At 13.8"" x 13.8"" this tote is the perfect size to carry your books, iPad, KeepCup and whatever else you need when you make a trip to Source. Our t-shirt is a black unisex shirt with a slightly distressed orange logo.

You’ll be welcomed into Source like you're part of the family, and we'll serve you the highest quality coffee, tea and baked goods prepared expertly and efficiently. If you have a train to catch at 7:00, we’ll make sure you’re in and out the door as quickly as possible. If you want to stay and chat about the farmers who grow our newest drip coffee offering, that’s great too.  Ethical Sourcing. You can feel good knowing that each time you buy a cup of coffee at Source Coffeehouse you're taking a stand against exploitation in the coffee industry. You’ll know exactly where your cup of joe comes from because we are working with Crop to Cup Coffee, a company that has taken transparency and ethical trade to new heights through their relationship-driven business model. As they explain on their website, “Crop to Cup is an importer, broker and wholesaler of green and roasted relationship coffees from unique sources. We provide the supply chain tools for our customers to connect with their coffee and its origins, and build successful and sustainable coffee programs. We work closely with each community from whom we source coffee, and we choose expert partners in the fields of agronomy, logistics and roasting. To us and our customers, coffee is so much more than a commodity.”We are thrilled to be working with this company. You will love both their coffee and the great feeling you’ll get knowing that your money is going to real people being paid real, respectable wages for their work, all the way across the supply chain. We're also committed to providing fair trade/organic whole leaf tea, and we will constantly seek to align our business practices and product line with our values. Community Engagement. Our vision is for Source to be actively involved in the community around us- from donating our used coffee grounds to local gardeners to hosting fundraising events for area nonprofits- we hope to become a part of the fabric of this community in a meaningful way. We want to do more than just serve you coffee; this is something we'll be intentional about this from day one. Sustainability.We take environmental stewardship seriously, and are working to do our part. From purchasing fully compostable paper products to encouraging reuse with our customized ""KeepCups"" and Green Card discount, we'll seek to minimize waste and make decisions that reflect our commitment to caring for the earth and the limited resources we've been entrusted with. This is our soon-to-be storefront! We'll be on the right, under the ""dish"" awning. We're sharing space with Toni's Tuscan Table- we'll serve you coffee in the morning and afternoon, Toni will serve you a delicious Italian dinner at night. Black Rock Physical Therapy is moving into the storefront on the left, the former home of Port. What Needs to HappenSo, what now? We’ve got the vision. We’ve got the space. We’ve got most of the equipment. But we need a few more things to get this show on the road. Because this opportunity presented itself rather suddenly, we've had to fast track everything and we need to bring in some additional funds to supplement our own investment. We need to raise at least $12,000 in three weeks to help us cover a portion of our start-up expenses. While this is the minimum we need to move forward, our ultimate goal is to raise $15,000. This would offset the cost of our ""perks"" and fees from PayPal and Indiegogo and allow us to use the full $12,000 towards our expenses. Here's where the money will go: 
Food licensing fees 
Build-out: installation of cabinets and countertop, plumbing, electrical work 
Equipment: new under-counter fridge
Start-Up Inventory: coffee, tea, pastries, cups, sugar, milk etc.
Here's how you can help: 
Can you spare $1 and a just couple minutes of your time? We hope you’ll support this project financially and become a part of the Source family. We’ve got all sorts of fun perks for our supporters, from a shout-out on our website ($1+) to a lifetime supply of coffee ($2,000+). We're creating Source for you and we'd love for you to be involved from the ground up! You can learn more about our perks below and to the right. Your donation of any amount will help us bring our dream to life and bring you great coffee. 
Next, be sure to follow us on Facebook and Twitter. One of the biggest things you can do to help us reach our goal is simply to share this campaign on your Facebook, Twitter, Blog, etc. and get the word out. And how about this: we'll give you one free cup of coffee if you share our campaign with your network online. Just take a screen shot of the post and either email it to us or bring it in to the shop after we've opened and we'll give you a medium cup of coffee or tea.
TELL EVERYONE YOU KNOW! Help us get the word out in ""the real world"". We've got posters and business cards promoting the campaign, and we can get those to you if you have a place to share them. Have any other ideas for how to get the word our? We're all ears- just send an email to courtneyhartl@me.com.
**To learn more about our financial situation and why we're confident we can get this business off the ground with a limited budget, please head to our Updates section (a tab near the top of the page) and check out the update titled ""How are we going to stay in business on a shoestring budget?""**How to ContributeDonating to our campaign is easy as can be- you don't need an account with Indiegogo or even PayPal (unless you're giving an amount over $1,000- in which case you'll need to sign up for a PayPal account). You just need a couple minutes, an email address and a credit card! To contribute to our campaign, look for the big Contribute Now button on the right hand side of the page. Clicking on this button will bring you to the Contribution Check Out page. Once there, enter the amount of money you'd like to contribute and select your Perk! You'll then be led through a couple of quick steps to complete the transaction. Please note that your credit card or PayPal account will be charged immediately, as soon as you complete your contribution check out process, not at the end of the campaign. PayPal will hold that money, and at the end of the funding period it will be sent to us, or returned to you if we don't meet our goal. Not comfortable donating online? Contact us directly and we can talk about alternate payment methods. Perks!Each perk we've selected has been carefully thought out to reflect what we value as a company. Our target date for getting you these Perks is February 1, 2014. In reality, many will be available sooner- particularly for those of you who are local and can pick up in store. You may notice that many of the Perks include a 5 or 10 cup coffee card. If you live out of town and would prefer we send you a bag of freshly roasted Crop to Cup coffee instead, just let us know! First up we have these stickers. They're high quality vinyl with UV laminate- making them super durable and weather-safe! We added the ""Drink Local"" sticker for Small Business Saturday, and will be giving that to everyone who makes a donation of $5 or more! Next up we have the KeepCup and our fabulous coffee. This is not the actual color scheme of OUR KeepCup (we're still working on that), but it shows you what a KeepCup is. It's a super fun alternative to paper cups. KeepCup is leading a movement in the coffee industry away from waste and towards reuse- and we are all about that! Every minute, over 1 million disposable cups are discarded in a landfill. YIKES! Let's do our part to stem the tide. You can choose your KeepCup to correspond with our small (8oz), medium (12oz) or large (16oz) drink sizes, and each time you use it, you'll get 10% off your drink! And of course, there's the coffee. It's a 10oz bag of freshly roasted coffee. It comes with a postcard you can send to the farmers who helped grow it. It's delicious. And finally, we have our fair trade/organic cotton tote bag and t-shirt! At 13.8"" x 13.8"" this tote is the perfect size to carry your books, iPad, KeepCup and whatever else you need when you make a trip to Source. Our t-shirt is a black unisex shirt with a slightly distressed orange logo. Both of these items come from Freeset - an incredible organization that provides an employment opportunities for women trapped in the sex trade in Calcutta. 
Who We Are
Wow, kudos to you if you made it this far! Since you're choosing to invest in us, we want to give you a little more insight into who we are and why you can trust us with your money, and more importantly your coffee. Matt worked as a barista at Starbucks throughout high school and college. He now works in public accounting, and will be a licensed CPA as of January. His accounting and business knowledge help us keep our feet on the ground and make sound decisions. He knows how to make the numbers work, and how to adhere to tax and other legal regulations- which is pretty important. He also knows how to make a great latte, and roasts his own coffee for fun. He possesses a wealth of coffee-related knowledge that he can't wait to share with you. Courtney worked as a barista and manager in several independent coffee shops for six years. She took her interest in the coffee industry deeper while completing her masters in Nonprofit Management at Eastern University. This culminated in a capstone project titled “Creating a Theoretical Framework for the Fair Trade Coffee Shop”, which included field research from coffee farms in Costa Rica. She looks forward to bringing her community development experience into the business and using Source as a jumping off point for deeper community involvement in Black Rock. So that's us :) We're so excited to be joining this community, and we can't wait to get to know you. Come in, say hi, tell us your story, drink good coffee. Thanks to all who have helped us get this far; we have been so blessed by our incredibly supportive family and friends and these talented folks:Chris Beesley, our graphic designer extraordinaire who created the Source logo and is designing the merchandise for our perks, and our website, and our everything. Hannah Gunnell, our fabulous photographer who took all the pictures you see here.",6.0,0,"1 Campaign

</div><p>
</p><p>Welcome to our Flibook Crowdfunding Campaign!  We’re a team of flying enthusiasts who came together around the idea of making it easier for you to fly on your own terms. Marie is our visionary and instigator.
She imagined and started Flibook after observing the tremendous and friendly potential the general aviation community has to offer. Whether you are a pilot looking to expand your circle of pilot friends, an aviation student who could use some peer support, a pet owner willing to  learn to fly with your pooch, a small drone operator interested in safe flying, someone longing for green flying, or an aviation volunteer looking to find your next mission or increase your impact, Flibook exists to help you!</p><p></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""326"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FiSsdjly4gI4%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DiSsdjly4gI4&amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FiSsdjly4gI4%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube"" width=""580""></iframe></div><p></p><p><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">OUR VISION</b><br/></p>

<span><span><span><span><span><span><span>vision</span></span></span></span></span></span></span> is to bring ""amazing"" back to flying and <span><span><span><span><span><span><span>responsible</span></span></span></span></span></span></span>
<span><span><span><span><span><span><span>wanderlust</span></span></span></span></span></span></span> to our skies!  Our mission is to strengthen and expand the
<span><span><span><span><span><span><span>general</span></span></span></span></span></span></span> aviation community. In other words, we are bringing more people <span><span>to</span></span> general aviation. </p>
<p><b>WHAT IS GENERAL AVIATION?</b></p>
<p>In short, it’s privately owned or rented small
<span><span><span><span><span><span><span>aircraft</span></span></span></span></span></span></span>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>THE PROBLEM</b></p>
<p>
</p><p>On the one hand, there
<span><span><span><span><span><span><span>is</span></span></span></span></span></span></span> a lack of connectivity in the general aviation community, impeding <span><span><span><span><span><span><span>its</span></span></span></span></span></span></span>
<span><span><span><span><span><span><span>growth</span></span></span></span></span></span></span> despite tremendous potential. On the other hand, because of pressures in
<span><span><span><span><span><span><span>airline</span></span></span></span></span></span></span> travel, we are experiencing the demise of “amazing” in flying. Additionally,
<span><span><span><span><span><span><span>general</span></span></span></span></span></span></span> aviation isn’t being utilized at its full potential in rescue and
<span><span><span><span><span><span><span>wildlife</span></span></span></span></span></span></span> conservation operations. Connectivity, amazing flying, and rescue operations are <span><span><span><span><span><span><span>causes</span></span></span></span></span></span></span> the Flibook team champions and wants to
<span><span><span><span><span><span><span>build</span></span></span></span></span></span></span> on.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>THE OPPORTUNITY</b></p>
<p>We
<span><span><span><span><span><span><span>underuse</span></span></span></span></span></span></span> and undervalue general aviation; there is an opportunity for huge
<span><span><span><span><span><span><span>growth</span></span></span></span></span></span></span>, expansion, and impact in this industry and with this community.</p>
<p></p>

<span><span><span><span><span><span><span>connectivity</span></span></span></span></span></span></span>, strength and growth <span><span><span><span><span><span><span>to</span></span></span></span></span></span></span> general aviation through our on- and

<span></span><span></span><br/></div>","ABOUT US

Welcome to our Flibook Crowdfunding Campaign!  We’re a team of flying enthusiasts who came together around the idea of making it easier for you to fly on your own terms. Marie is our visionary and instigator.
She imagined and started Flibook after observing the tremendous and friendly potential the general aviation community has to offer. Whether you are a pilot looking to expand your circle of pilot friends, an aviation student who could use some peer support, a pet owner willing to  learn to fly with your pooch, a small drone operator interested in safe flying, someone longing for green flying, or an aviation volunteer looking to find your next mission or increase your impact, Flibook exists to help you!OUR VISION
Our
vision is to bring ""amazing"" back to flying and responsible
wanderlust to our skies!  Our mission is to strengthen and expand the
general aviation community. In other words, we are bringing more people to general aviation. 
WHAT IS GENERAL AVIATION?
In short, it’s privately owned or rented small
aircraft. 

THE PROBLEM

On the one hand, there
is a lack of connectivity in the general aviation community, impeding its
growth despite tremendous potential. On the other hand, because of pressures in
airline travel, we are experiencing the demise of “amazing” in flying. Additionally,
general aviation isn’t being utilized at its full potential in rescue and
wildlife conservation operations. Connectivity, amazing flying, and rescue operations are causes the Flibook team champions and wants to
build on.

THE OPPORTUNITY
We
underuse and undervalue general aviation; there is an opportunity for huge
growth, expansion, and impact in this industry and with this community.

OUR SOLUTION
Bringing
connectivity, strength and growth to general aviation through our on- and
off-line Flibook platform. Our
dedicated team has solid (even Olympic!) experience in aviation and with the FAA,
building social networks, business, entrepreneurship, and communications. 
OUR GOAL
People flying on their
own terms through Flibook. 

WHAT WE NEED & WHAT YOU GET
$4,000 for an
interactive prototype
$3,000 for startups.co
services that will make us investor ready
$2,000 for legal fees
  = $9,000 (Phase One)
Anything we raise above
$9,000 will go towards Phase Two:
Minimal Viable Product/Flibook
1.0 ($40,000)
Now to the fun part—our
perks! Just for you, our loyal fans, we’ve designed an awesome Flibook T-shirt
in a cool color called Prairie Dust. We have a beautiful, handmade necklace. We
have an author-signed children’s book, a true story about a great dog stuck at
the pound who overcomes a fear of flying to find his forever home. We have gorgeous, original wildlife photography.We have stunning and colorful wild animal sculptures made from recycled flip-flops, brought to you from Kenya.For the adventurers out there, we have two one-of-a-kind experiences: An
off-the-beaten-path safari AND a private flying lesson with our advisor
and mentor, Patty Wagstaff, an American aerobatic national champion pilot. This
is the chance to meet an aviation icon who is also a great leader and a
wonderful person! Finally, if your thing is to have Marie and Atlas entertain
you, we have got you covered, too!Flibook is more than a
digital platform—it’s a community. We invite all of you to join us, our vision,
and our impact. Support us today and choose from one of our great perks. By the
same token, you will help our social and environmental impact partners! (Spoiler Alert: wild baby elephant pen pals await you!) Spread the word, tell your friends and networks about Flibook. We can’t wait to
have you all aboard!Marie, Ariel, Lori, John, and Atlas",8.0,1,"1 Campaign

<p>Wer steckt hinter vekoop? Timo Schliep, 34, und Sebastian Brandstetter, 27. Wir haben uns im Masterstudium im Rahmen eines Gründerseminars zusammengetan und seitdem an dem Konzept für vekoop gearbeitet. Wir bringen jahrelange Erfahrung in den Bereichen Vertrieb, Marketing, Mediengestaltung und Journalismus/PR in das Projekt mit ein. Darüber hinaus sind wir beide von Lebensmittelallergien und -intoleranzen betroffen. Nicht nur deswegen ist uns bewusste Ernährung wichtig!</p>
<p>Für unsere Idee wurden wir bereits mit dem Gründercampus-Preis vom Land Niedersachsen ausgezeichnet, zudem haben wir einen eCommerce-Wettbewerb von TLC communications gewonnen. Unser Businessplan ist also von Experten überprüft. Außerdem können wir weiterhin jederzeit auf unseren Coach am Gründungszentrum der Uni Oldenburg und viel Expertise im Bekanntenkreis zurückgreifen.</p>

<h3>Wie könnt ihr helfen?</h3>

<p>Wir sind mit der Umsetzung unserer Idee bereits auf einem guten Weg, doch wie jedes Unternehmen brauchen wir finanziellen Spielraum, um als Start-Up einen weiteren Schritt zu machen und möglichst gesund wachsen zu können.</p>

<h3>Und warum sind wir unterstützenswert?</h3>
<p>Ganz einfach: Weil wir die Dinge anders angehen und in vekoop mehr als nur ein Unternehmen sehen. Wir wollen ein Miteinander von Kunde und Verkäufer, ein Geben und Nehmen. Als persönlich Betroffene haben wir uns einen Markt ausgesucht, der uns sehr wichtig ist. Wir wissen, wie schwer es ist, die richtigen Produkte online und offline zu finden. Bei uns könnt Ihr nicht nur eine große Auswahl rein pflanzlicher Produkte finden, sondern auch Wünsche äußern und darüber abstimmen, wie das Sortiment erweitert werden soll - in Form von Produkten und in Form von Rezeptebundles! Ihr seid nicht nur Kunden, sondern Partner des Shops, der sich gezielt an euch und eure Bedürfnisse anpassen soll. In der zugehörigen Community könnt ihr euch austauschen, Rezepte einstellen, Restaurantempfehlen aussprechen, Bewertungen hinterlegen. Im Shop könnt ihr Allergien angeben und bekommt fortan nur noch passende Produkte angezeigt. Ihr habt die Möglichkeit, ganze Bundles zu kaufen und hier zu sparen. Außerdem bieten wir durch Ratgeber und Social-Media-Elemente ein „Mehr“ an Informationen auch für unerfahrenere Käufer, um so ein einfaches, unbeschwertes Einkaufen zu ermöglichen.</p>
<p>Uns ist bei all unseren Aktivitäten aber auch die Nachhaltigkeit des Unternehmens selbst wichtig: Unser Strom ist Ökostrom, Pakete werden CO2-neutral verschickt, wir haben klimafreundliches Webhosting und eine Bank, die Nachhaltigkeit und soziale Projekte fördert. Weiterhin werden wir alle Überschüsse, die aus dem Verkauf des ersten Buches ""veguide"" generiert werden, spenden - ebenso wie einen Teil des späteren Gewinns unseres Shops. Die Spenden werden humanitären, nachhaltigen und im Bereich des Tierschutz tätigen Organisationen zukommen. Welche Organisationen das im Detail sein werden, werdet natürlich auch ihr als Teil der Community sowie alle weiteren Besucher und Kunden unserer Seite mit entscheiden können!</p>
<h3>Alles klar? Dann seid Ihr gefragt!</h3>
</div>
<div>
<p>Ihr seid überzeugt? Dann brauchen wir eure Unterstützung! Sichert euch eins der tollen Supporter-Packs. Knapp bei Kasse? Erzählt euren Freunden von der Kampagne, teilt sie in den sozialen Netzwerken, steuert Ideen bei! Wir sind auf euch gespannt und danken schon im Vorfeld!</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The impact of this event will be to give EVERY person who attends two solid strategic ideas for their business and the tools to carry that out. I'm also going to continue to work with every attendee, at no further cost, for 8 weeks. The knowledge AND the coach to help you utilize it. THAT is the impact! </p>

I need a handful of investors (or an army of small ones)! What you get... well, by all means, come to the event! Anyone who donates $97 can come to the event (and bring a friend for free!). Anyone who donates $200 gets a 15-minute strategy session with me.  For more, see the perks section!

The North Valley Food Co-op is currently re-organizing to become a trusted source of natural foods and local products, and a reliable resource for consumer information and education in Shasta County, CA. We represent a dedicated group of core volunteers and 65 members who have come together to work with this purpose in mind. We are actively cooperating with other regional consumer food co-ops and organizations like Growing Local Coalition http://growinglocal.blogspot.com/ and the California Center for Cooperative Development http://www.cccd.coop/ who can encourage our development by providing training, technical resources and grant writing assistance for co-op development. This site has been set up as one way to help raise funds so that we can turn our vision for the North Valley Food Co-op into a reality. Please help us reach our goal!

Our Potential Impact...
Most food co-ops, whether they are 40 years old, or 5, started the same way: With people coming together in places where they live and work to collectively do something for the common good. Those area residents from decades past who decided to start food co-ops here might not have had any idea that their stores would one day become multimillion-dollar businesses, part of a network of national food cooperation. 

Food co-ops have been a model for businesses responsive to community needs, as well as a stimulant for local economic growth. In recent years, their impact on local sustainable agriculture and the neighborhoods they serve has been remarkable. Co-ops partner with many area producers and organizations to bring fresh local food to communities while providing sustainable family farms with a larger market to reach out to consumers. They’re also among the first to lend a hand when crisis strikes. One of the main differences between co-ops and other ownership structures is that owners get a share of the profit based on how much they use the co-op. 

Authentically Local...
Another thing co-ops have historically done well is raise awareness among consumers for the importance of local, sustainably produced food. Not only does this strengthen the food co-ops’ links to farmers, it also widens the economic impact. Studies show that for $100 spent at a locally owned business, $45 is recycled into the local economy, versus only $14 when the $100 is spent in a national chain.

Community Ownership – Community ownership means member-owners have a say in how the business is run. Community ownership preserves and celebrates what is unique and local. Community ownership fights corporate hegemony!

Board Representation – A Board of elected co-op members represents The Food Co-op’s members. The Board sets policy and supervises the operations of the co-op. Each member gets one vote.

Teaching the Basics...
Another way food co-ops serve communities is through education. Although a lot of education happens every day in store aisles, classrooms are where the co-op principle of education is delivered more formally. “Education is a huge part of our store,” said Liz McMann, education and special projects manager at the St. Paul co-op. “We offer practical cooking classes and shopping tips. We gear classes toward the average person getting dinner on the table, as well as teach those with special dietary needs or preferences how to deal with them. We also have fun classes for do-it-yourself activities, such as how to make your own vinegar or dog food.”

And Reaching Out...
According to Charli Mills, marketing communications manager at Valley Natural Foods, another way co-ops serve communities is through donations and outreach programs. In the past nine years, Valley’s donations have increased from $500 per year to $51, 000—an increase of 255 percent. “Our board developed a vision for donations and set specific goals for increasing our outreach to the community,” Mills noted. “The whole idea is to create community,” Mills said. The more economically healthy our co-op is, the more we can give back to the community organizations that serve us.”

<p> </p></div>","Please find it in your heart to help fulfill 2 dreams of a special 10yr old. Sierra has made it to the AAU National Junior Olympics 2012, down in Houston, Tx! Sierra will try for a national title in the open 400M, 200M and the Long Jump.
3 weeks later, Sierra is expected to be in Los Angeles, Ca to meet with Wilhelmina Models for a huge casting.
Sierra is a very talented 10yr old who loves Track & Field and Modeling. Sierra has excelled in Track at a very early age and has an appreciation for it. Her specialties are the open 400M, 200M, and Long Jump. Sierra idolizes my former trackmate LoLo Jones. When Sierra is off the track, she loves playing with her older brother Jaylen who has Cerebral Palsy, playing with her puppy and she rips the runway modeling all the latest trends. For only being 10yrs old, Sierra stands at a whooping 5'3! Sierra has been compared to a young Tyra Banks : )
Sierra was crowned:
Most Beautiful Baby Iowa State Pageant 2004
Runner up Miss Cinderella Pageant Omaha,Ne 2004
Most Beautiful Eyes Iowa Pageant 2004
Miss Personality Iowa Pageant 2005
Top 10 Finalist for Regis and Kelly Coolpix Beautiful Kid Contest 2006
The Goal of $7,000 will help with:
Flights for Sierra and one adult(Mom) to Houston,Tx and Los Angeles, Ca.
Lodging in both states.
Registration to AAU Junior Olympics and new running suit.
Meals and ground transportaion in both states.
Any extra cost business related.
Any money donated over the asking amount will be donated to providing Christmas gifts to children with disabilities, services at the Ronald McDonald House who serves children going through medical situations and helps the families through those tough times, and services to babies in neonatal intensive care wards.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>An online community is only as sucessful as its participants, so we want to get the word out quickly to those who will use this forum. Here are some of the ideas that I've had which will require funding, though I am also open to suggestions from contributors:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Fliers:</strong> I have about 5,000 of these. We've already flown to DC once to distribute these at the Marine Corp Marathon and the Washington DC VA Medical Center, but it will be more cost-effective to ship them to centers and businesses which have agreed to display them. We'd love to send these out specifically to non-profits with similiar missions. Most of the funds that I hope to raise will go towards the printing and shipping of these fliers.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>T-shirts with the StillFighting.org logo</strong> and domain name will be sold through an online store, with any profit either going towards the maintenance of the site or a specified charity. This will also help to spread the word. I also plan to give them out at local amateur fights and to local gyms, but it would be great to be able to ship these and other free items such as bumper stickers to outside locations, including veterans' hospitals or even military bases.</li>

<strong>Rich Media Banners</strong> will be purchased for placement on relevant websites and blogs. These will be intelligently targeted to those who are searching for a place where they can talk openly with their peers of similar experience.</li>

<h3><strong>The Mill Creek Farm</strong></h3>
In 2005, two young women who were passionate about farming and food education saw an opportunity to start an educational urban farm on vacant land in West Philadelphia. The Mill Creek Farm grew out of this vision. The project reclaimed the blighted lot at 49th and Brown Streets, adjacent to an active community garden, and transformed it into a productive, dynamic space for environmental education and food access for the community.<br/><br/>The Mill Creek Farm has been a leader in the urban farming movement in Philadelphia, serving as an educational resource, demonstrating green building methods as well as sustainable agriculture, providing access to fresh produce in the neighborhood, and allowing visitors to connect with nature, inspiring creative solutions to environmental challenges.<br/><br/>Now, as we approach our 8th growing season in 2013, the staff and board of the Mill Creek Farm need your support to seize this opportunity to transition to a new phase and build a  stronger and more sustainable staff structure for our farm and education programs. Mill Creek Farm’s staff wear many hats. They are farmers. They are educators. They are administrators. They are fund-raisers. We want our farm staff to be able to focus on what’s most important: growing fresh food and running what is a staple farm education program in Philadelphia. The Mill Creek Farm aims to hire an Executive Director to manage the organization’s development, outreach, and planning, and enable the farm staff to do what they do best, and we need initial seed funding to make that happen.<br/><br/><div><em>With your contribution, Mill Creek Farm will be able to hire an experienced Executive Director who can focus on the administrative, planning, and fundraising needs, giving us the support to grow more food, work with more urban youth, and strengthen the  community.<strong id=""internal-source-marker_0.45011782832443714""><br/></strong></em></div>
<h3><strong>We need your help to plant the seed.</strong></h3>
<div>We need additional funding to hire an Executive Director. If we do not reach our $20,000 goal and are unable to hire an Executive Director at this time, all contributions will still go to support the farm’s operations and educational programs.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>All donations are tax-deductible and will be rewarded by perks that mirror our mission, but most importantly, you will get the satisfaction of knowing that you have stepped up in support of an educational urban farm that will continue to serve the Mill Creek neighborhood and the West Philadelphia community for years to come.</div>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Your Impact</h3>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Your support will help the farm maintain improved fresh </span><span>food access</span><span>, environmental benefits (storm water management, reduction of noise and the urban ‘heat island’ effect, removal of litter, site beautification), and education programs, which attract people from the immediate neighborhood, all over the city, and the world. The farm inspires visitors, enabling them to see solutions in action and envision how they can creatively </span><span>address environmental challenges</span>. Involvement with the farm fosters environmental stewardship and civic engagement, giving youth more information to make choices for a healthy life and affect positive change in their communities.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Kids like Joe and Ray (who you can see in the video above) come by the farm to learn and explore,  gaining skills </span><span>such as planting and caring for a garden. Experiences like harvesting and tasting food fresh from the field help to nurture and reinforce healthy habits.  After volunteering as a young kid, our neighbor </span><span>Mark came back several years later for a summer job, </span><span>developing communication skills and confidence, and gaining experience with marketing and customer service.</span></p>
<p>Over the course of 7 years, we have built relationships with people of all backgrounds: dedicated customers who have come to rely on our fresh vegetables, many seniors who grew up on farms in the South and love our fresh okra; teachers who bring their students back again and again; volunteers who help maintain the farm; and supporters who help to spread the word and contribute to our work.</p>
<p><em>With your support, the Mill Creek Farm will continue to build  on these successes.</em>  </p>

The Mill Creek Farm aims to hire an Executive Director to manage the organization’s development, outreach, and planning, and enable the farm staff to do what they do best, and we need initial seed funding to make that happen.With your contribution, Mill Creek Farm will be able to hire an experienced Executive Director who can focus on the administrative, planning, and fundraising needs, giving us the support to grow more food, work with more urban youth, and strengthen the  community.
We need your help to plant the seed.
We need additional funding to hire an Executive Director. If we do not reach our $20,000 goal and are unable to hire an Executive Director at this time, all contributions will still go to support the farm’s operations and educational programs.
 
All donations are tax-deductible and will be rewarded by perks that mirror our mission, but most importantly, you will get the satisfaction of knowing that you have stepped up in support of an educational urban farm that will continue to serve the Mill Creek neighborhood and the West Philadelphia community for years to come.


Your Impact
Your support will help the farm maintain improved fresh food access, environmental benefits (storm water management, reduction of noise and the urban ‘heat island’ effect, removal of litter, site beautification), and education programs, which attract people from the immediate neighborhood, all over the city, and the world. The farm inspires visitors, enabling them to see solutions in action and envision how they can creatively address environmental challenges. Involvement with the farm fosters environmental stewardship and civic engagement, giving youth more information to make choices for a healthy life and affect positive change in their communities.
Kids like Joe and Ray (who you can see in the video above) come by the farm to learn and explore,  gaining skills such as planting and caring for a garden. Experiences like harvesting and tasting food fresh from the field help to nurture and reinforce healthy habits.  After volunteering as a young kid, our neighbor Mark came back several years later for a summer job, developing communication skills and confidence, and gaining experience with marketing and customer service.
Over the course of 7 years, we have built relationships with people of all backgrounds: dedicated customers who have come to rely on our fresh vegetables, many seniors who grew up on farms in the South and love our fresh okra; teachers who bring their students back again and again; volunteers who help maintain the farm; and supporters who help to spread the word and contribute to our work.
With your support, the Mill Creek Farm will continue to build  on these successes.  


Other Ways You Can Help
We know some people can’t contribute, but that doesn’t mean you can’t help:

I started the Cheesecake Store to help to support my family while I looked for a new job. Jobs were hard to obtain with such a high unemployment rate, at the time. So, I strapped on my boots and walked and talked The Cheesecake Store to anyone that would listen. With help from my friends I kept going. On my own, I built a website to sell my products.  In order for me to sell to the public, I used a community commercial-rental kitchen.  I transformed my family vehicle into the the Cheesecake mobile, which then became a certified mobile vendor vehicle!  The rental kitchen I use is far away from home, so I really need a closer kitchen with a retail shop so everyone in the southwest suburbs of Chicago can stop and have a cheesecake jar ,a cup of coffee and a place to sit and chat. Since I have exhausted every loan option with the banks to no avail, I need your help.  You will forever be a part of my cheesecake family.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3><p>The $10,000 that I am seeking will help me open a small retail shop with a commercial kitchen. </p><ul>

 Reunitems.com is a new website with its interest across a timeline yesterday to yesteryear, reuniting people with recently lost property, selling and auctioning retro, antique and collectable items, and repatriating users with family heirlooms and providing genealogists with tactile items to add to 1 dimensional family trees, and giving them a new search resource and archive.</p><p> Is this the ‘next big thing’?

We list recently lost &amp; found items – we auction and sell desired retro, antiques and collectable items – we repatriate families with their forefathers’ heirlooms and provide a searchable archive of genealogical name tagged items.

Art can be such a good investment and you can have a valuable signed print of these talented and sought after artists which can grow in value. On the reverse it will be acknowledged that you have participated with pioneering spirit in Reunitems.com and this may increase its value too when it becomes a collectable in its own right or in landmarking this era in web activity. You could be gifted the original too!

Maggie Grant’s Sampler – the poster print of this 111 year old sampler will, on the reverse, acknowledge that that you have participated with pioneering spirit in Reunitems.com and this may increase its value too when it becomes a collectable in its own right or in landmarking this era in web activity. You could be gifted the original too!</p><p>

The Adverts are offered on a first come first served basis across the first 6 months of the restyled site – where possible we will schedule your ad at your chosen time.
</p><p>
We believe most of our possessions will outlive us and we are therefor temporary custodians of everything. To this end, the Sampler could be loved and looked after by a non family member until one turns up. At this time the owner can decide if they are ready to part with it or may be able to forecast to the family when they would. Alternatively they could offer a copy or arrange to let them visit and see the item etc.
</p><p>
As you see the site encourages good karma and charitable giving and direct gifting, alongside opportunities for users to make some extra money. It is important to understand that every user listing a Genealogical item can have a different  motivation and each is valid. We have created a system which allows for every such item to be sold on to anyone and have safeguarded that the rightful owner or qualifying family member or organisation perhaps, will still be able to trace the current owner/custodian through our archive, in order to claim the item or offer a payment.
</p><p><strong>
The Impact</strong>
</p><p>
This is a world first providing the opportunity to have our things returned to us – forever things…all items we and our families have been separated from across time!
