<p><strong>Acerca de mí</strong></p>
<p>Soy Diana Tovar, cantante e investigadora de Cartagena, radicada en Bogotá (Colombia). Desde 2010 desarrollo mi proyecto como solista. Esta propuesta musical aborda la riqueza de las músicas colombianas con nuevos sonidos, lenguajes rítmicos y mezclas a través de la canción.</p>
<p>La música es una oportunidad de expresión infinita llena de posibilidades. Mi voz y mi canto son un lugar de encuentro conmigo misma, y es sencillamente mágico compartirla con todos ustedes. Canto desde los doce años, y desde el año 2010 me lancé a la aventura de liderar un proyecto de música independiente como cantante, compositora y directora. Provengo de un lugar mágico del Caribe: Cartagena. Allí crecí cerca al mar y las músicas afroantillanas, la salsa y la champeta, entre otras, hasta hacer mi vida en la fría y también cálida Bogotá, que me ha acogido generosamente, lugar donde se conjugan músicas, ritmos e influencias diversas. </p>
<p>A lo largo de estos años he venido madurando un sonido propio lleno de universos sonoros y ricos en melodías y letras. Complemento mi actividad artística con actividades de tipo cultural, social y de género con mi trabajo y mi interés como investigadora con comunidades afectadas por el conflicto y con mujeres víctimas de violencia de género. Todo esto hace parte de mi inspiración para componer y este álbum, compuesto por diez canciones, es la suma de estos años de experiencias musicales. Esta campaña es importante para mí porque me permitirá materializar este proyecto.  Estoy emocionada de poder compartir con ustedes la felicidad de sacar a la luz este trabajo.</p>
<p><strong>El álbum Canciones de mar y río</strong></p>
<p>Esta campaña de financiación colectiva tiene como objeto costear los gastos de mezcla, master, impresión, arte y promoción del disco para su edición, publicación y lanzamiento.</p>
<p>Canciones de mar y río es mi primer álbum y cuenta con 10 canciones escritas por mí. En él participaron grandes músicos de la escena de la músicas populares colombianas y el jazz. El álbum fue grabado entre julio y agosto del 2016, con el productor Oscar Alford. Las fotografías para el arte del álbum fueron tomadas en diciembre de 2016 por el fotógrafo francés Louis Nespoulous, y la dirección de arte de las fotografías fue realizada por Diego Santamaría. En lo que va del año hemos trabajado en las piezas audiovisuales y la estrategia de promoción, y la preparación de la campaña para sacar adelante este proyecto.</p>
<p>En 2016 financié por mi propia cuenta la grabación de la música, y el material audiovisual para poder promocionar mi trabajo, así como las fotografías para prensa, portada del álbum y librillo en el que irán las letras de las canciones.</p>
<p>Hasta el momento no tengo ningún sello discográfico ni apoyo de ningún patrocinador.</p>
<p>El álbum fue grabado en bloque en los estudios de Audiovisión por el ingeniero Stefano Pizzaia. Hicimos grabaciones adicionales (coros, voces y semillas) en los estudios Epia con el ingeniero Rafael Santamaría. Tiene la participación especial de la gran Lucía Pulido en la canción ""Amanecer"". </p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Sabroso is a Portland, Oregon based Latin Funk band formed by brothers Ricardo and Pablo Ojeda formerly of the band Rubberneck. From an early age, brothers Ricardo and Pablo have had a love for music and have always wanted to get their music out to as many people as possible. Most bands could easily set up a few mics and record an album on a laptop but Sabroso wants a quality product. We are passionate about our music and want it to come across exactly how we intend it. Recording in a real studio is not cheap but will guarantee we turn out the best product possible. We want to be proud of what we produce but more importantly we want our fans to have an amazing, high quality album of new music.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>In order to complete our latest project we will need funds for studio time, an engineer, mixing, mastering, and finally printing of the CDs.</p>
<p>For each generous contribution there will be perks such as the new CD once it has been completed, your name added to the liner notes, free tickets to upcoming shows, and more.</p>
<p>If we are unable to reach our goal it may delay the release of our album but we will still use every penny to pay for this album. Every little bit helps! </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Without your contribution it will be very difficult for us to complete this project. We really want this album to be special, not only for us but for our fans as well. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The major risk and challenge facing us is time. We want to get this album into people's hands as soon as possible. Without outside funding it could delay the project. We will finish the album regardless of what happens. Nothing can stop our drive to put out good music.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you are unable to contribute please consider sharing this campaign with anyone that might be able to help. We always welcome help in any form, monetary or not.</p>

<p>Music provides a voice to the heard and unheard. Growing up I was very shy and quiet. My journey through music has been interesting and provided a voice for me. I started out singing in the church as a young girl, as a kid I would see the videos of other artist or hear them on the radio singing, would love it, but didn’t think it would apply to me. Coming from a small city in Virginia I thought becoming a singer was unreachable, so I settled in my thoughts of just singing in church and believed I was giving back and doing what I was supposed to do.</p>
<p>Growing up in a real strict upbringing, as I grew up and started working, I would sneak to talent competitions and actually would win (shhh..don’t tell my dad)…lol. This will be his first time seeing this…lol.(He is very supportive of my singing career btw). I was surrounded by the pressures of living up to, in a lot of cases, assumptions of what I thought I should be doing or what was accepted and took a different path in the computer industry and started living, what I believed, the life I was supposed to live. I would audition for competitions every now and then, and still sing in the church thinking I was doing what I was supposed to do.</p>
<p>One day while singing at a church in California, a 16-year-old young man, spoke with his grandmother about me how he was touched, she then took his word and invited me to sing at her conferences for what now has been 10 years. Shortly after being invited my thinking and outlook started shifting and I started asking myself hard questions and doors began to open immediately for me and started walking in them. Every day as an artist and vocalist I keep growing and know that there is no limit, and everything is reachable and work to get out of my comfort zones.</p>
<p>I am blessed with an amazing daughter who sees her mom taking the steps to follow a calling and who is developing in her gift as songwriter, singer, scriptwriter, fashion stylist and who knows what else. I tell her there is no limit. My daughter is one of the crucial reasons that I pursue with tenacity and determination to be an example and setup a legacy for generations to come.</p>
<p>I have been blessed to perform in front of thousands of people and have opened for Billboard winner and 13x Grammy nominee Musiq Soulchild and have also toured internationally Grammy Winner Earl Thomas! I am excited to wbe working with some of the greatest songwriters, musicians and producer of our time.  My producer is 2x Grammy Winner, Kamau Kenyatta, who received two Grammy’s with the great Gregory Porter and was nominated for two others.  He has also worked with the legendary Aretha Franklin, New Kids on the Block, Patti Austin, SWV, Silk to only name of few. Kamau’s resume is extensive and I am so excited to work with him and be able to create a masterpiece with him.</p>

<h2><strong>How You Can Help</strong></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<strong>Pre-production</strong>: <ul><li>This crucial pre-production portion, done by all the best in field, is where Kamau and I spend time creating and refining our musical ideas. This is where we will pre-establish the song's creative premise. This decreases the time and money spent in expensive studios. The goal is to go into the major recording phase of production with the uncomplicated and most promising concepts having been already established.</li></ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Recording:</strong> <ul><li>To make this album something we all can be proud of some of the best musicians, and engineers will be hired.</li></ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Mixing &amp; Mastering:</strong><ul>
<li>Mixing is where we will address any recording issues, add creativity, and do everything to make this project “complete” and cohesive.</li>
<li>Mastering is where will test to make sure each song sounds great in isolation, competing in volume, clarity, and warmth with other songs on the market, and sounds great as a package with the other songs in the album.  Mastering provides a unifying feel in frequency response and volume across an entire record.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>CD pressing and promotion:</strong><ul><li>This includes an expert photographer for the album, graphic designer, cd duplication, and marketing</li></ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Please share this campaign and tell your friends. We are excited about this upcoming journey and grateful to experience this with you!</p>

This will be his first time seeing this…lol.(He is very supportive of my singing career btw). I was surrounded by the pressures of living up to, in a lot of cases, assumptions of what I thought I should be doing or what was accepted and took a different path in the computer industry and started living, what I believed, the life I was supposed to live. I would audition for competitions every now and then, and still sing in the church thinking I was doing what I was supposed to do.
One day while singing at a church in California, a 16-year-old young man, spoke with his grandmother about me how he was touched, she then took his word and invited me to sing at her conferences for what now has been 10 years. Shortly after being invited my thinking and outlook started shifting and I started asking myself hard questions and doors began to open immediately for me and started walking in them. Every day as an artist and vocalist I keep growing and know that there is no limit, and everything is reachable and work to get out of my comfort zones.
I am blessed with an amazing daughter who sees her mom taking the steps to follow a calling and who is developing in her gift as songwriter, singer, scriptwriter, fashion stylist and who knows what else. I tell her there is no limit. My daughter is one of the crucial reasons that I pursue with tenacity and determination to be an example and setup a legacy for generations to come.
I have been blessed to perform in front of thousands of people and have opened for Billboard winner and 13x Grammy nominee Musiq Soulchild and have also toured internationally Grammy Winner Earl Thomas! I am excited to wbe working with some of the greatest songwriters, musicians and producer of our time.  My producer is 2x Grammy Winner, Kamau Kenyatta, who received two Grammy’s with the great Gregory Porter and was nominated for two others.  He has also worked with the legendary Aretha Franklin, New Kids on the Block, Patti Austin, SWV, Silk to only name of few. Kamau’s resume is extensive and I am so excited to work with him and be able to create a masterpiece with him.

How You Can Help


Pre-production: This crucial pre-production portion, done by all the best in field, is where Kamau and I spend time creating and refining our musical ideas. This is where we will pre-establish the song's creative premise. This decreases the time and money spent in expensive studios. The goal is to go into the major recording phase of production with the uncomplicated and most promising concepts having been already established.


Recording: To make this album something we all can be proud of some of the best musicians, and engineers will be hired.


Mixing & Mastering:
Mixing is where we will address any recording issues, add creativity, and do everything to make this project “complete” and cohesive.
Mastering is where will test to make sure each song sounds great in isolation, competing in volume, clarity, and warmth with other songs on the market, and sounds great as a package with the other songs in the album.  Mastering provides a unifying feel in frequency response and volume across an entire record.



CD pressing and promotion:This includes an expert photographer for the album, graphic designer, cd duplication, and marketing

<p>Hi there good people! My name is TolumiDE (pronounced toe-lu me-day) I’m a singer-songwriter from Nigeria, born in Canada and currently based in the Maryland - Washington, D.C. area. Yes, I am truly an international artist (ha-ha) and I can’t wait to share this project with you!</p>
<p>I’m working on a two part project for my new music. The 1st will be a 6 song <strong>EP Album titled Mama Sunshine</strong><i> and the 2nd a </i><strong>Full-length Album #SuyaSoul</strong>. Mama Sunshine album will give listeners a more intimate setting with me. I share joys, memoirs and adventures of being a female in the 21st century, while staying transparent and open with the tough situations that life throws our way. The full-length album will include additional songs I've written and I will be working with talented industry professionals, musicians and producers.</p>
<p>I believe this upcoming project has the ability to connect with anyone that listens. I tell love stories through my music, not just love for your significant other, but all levels and areas of love. Love for the world, friendship, children, God and for life as a whole. I strive to create music that combines heart and soul messages that's relatable and keeps us grounded and appreciating life.  So, please continue to read and follow my journey.</p>

<p>I’ve always loved to sing, dance, and entertain. It all stared at a really young age and my parents have many memorable stories to share. <strong>My entrepreneur mum designed stylish outfits from her clothing store to wear for featured performance and my artist architect engineer dad would take me to performances while encouraging me to me to be the best I could possibly be with my art.</strong> Music naturally became a part of my life. While in Nigeria I sang at church, in primary and secondary school, with friends and on occasion had some singing and dancing routines with my four siblings. When I moved to Canada to study Fine Arts at York University I also sang in an all-female reggae band. That was my first introduction to formally performing in the music industry.</p>
<p><strong>In the final year of my undergrad studies, my mum died of cancer. </strong>I remember all I could think of when I got the call she had passed away, was how I had planned to call her the day before and I never got around to do so. I had to come to terms with what mattered most, wasn’t what she may or may not have said if I had called her the day before, but what she brought to my life during our time together. When I reflected on her strength and resilience through her battle with cancer and her smiles and ability to maintain her glow through tough moments, it made me think of the power of Sunshine.  It always comes out to brighten up the day and give a sense of hope, love and feeling.</p>

<p>After graduation, I spent some time as a broadcast graphic designer, I decided to embark on a journey into music as a <strong>solo independent Artist</strong>. I thought a lot about “Where do I start, what themes to share, what genres to target, what people would want to listen to my lyrics.” My ultimate goal became to focus on sharing and inspiring with 3 main ingredients - Love, Living and Laughter. With hopes that my music will shine rays of sunshine to all listeners. </p>
<p><strong>And so here I am today, with two albums, multiple singles, music videos, awards, nominations, national recognition and international performance experience all of which have been funded independently. It will be a great honor and joy to have you join me in creating my first fan-funded music album!</strong></p>

<p>Making Good quality music costs money. The budget I am seeking to raise for my campaign reflects my high aspirations. I strive to achieve the highest possible professional standards that will deliver good quality results, both within the industry and audiences worldwide. <strong>Your contribution will be used for the production cost of studio sessions, producer and musician fees, mixing, and mastering the music, album CD manufacturing and promotions to include, web, print and video.</strong> I have some funds saved from working as a full-time Broadcast Graphic Designer, but could use some more to truly create a project worthy of holding a “Masterpiece” title you will truly enjoy. The EP album will be released in December 2017 and the Full Album ""Suya Soul"" should be complete by  2018.</p>
<p>Also, <strong>in memory of my mother and celebration all mothers who radiate with super sunshine ""Mama Sunshine"", I have chosen to support IamWANDA - a non-profit organization</strong> established by Tambra Raye Stevenson which stands for women and girls advancing in nutrition dietetics and agriculture. I’m inspired by Tambra’s passion for education and advocacy for healthy living with good nutrition. I believe health is wealth and if we get back to the basis of feeding ourselves with good natural nutrients we surely can reduce and eliminate several diseases and illnesses plaguing our community. Her project is especially dear to my heart because my mother studied dietetics and agriculture and I’m certain that she would equally have as much passion to support this wonderful cause.

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Nerede kalmıştık?</h3>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Bu satırları okuyanlar arasında Tantana Records'ın önceki yayınlarını ve #Feedback serisini takip edenler olsa gerek. The Ringo Jets, Eskiz, Cosmic Wings, Help! The Captain Threw Up ve Palmiyeler'in LP'leri yayınlarken bir nevi abonelik sistemi kurmuş, plak severleri bu genç projeler ile bir araya getirmeyi, ""yeni sesler"" için ""sürdürülebilir"" bir yayın serisi yaratmayı hedeflemiştik.  Fena da yol almadık hani.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Peşinden Taner Öngür ustadan ""o telefon"" geldi. Bize yeni projesinden, albümünden bahsetti, aramıza katılabileceğini söyledi. Dünyalar bizim oldu. Projeye hız verince koca yaz nasıl geçti biz de anlamadık.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">İlk kez duyanlar için hızlı özet: Anadolu Pop’un anıt grubu Moğollar’ın kurucu efsanelerinden Taner Öngür’ün, 1920’ler ile 1970’ler arası taş plaklarda, kıyıda köşede kalmış İstanbul şarkılarını surf rock esintileriyle yeniden yorumladığı albümü “Elektrik Gramofon”u duyduk, bayıldık.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Siz de duyun, siz de bayılın diye Eylül ayı başında yayınladık.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>İlk baskı 250 kopya LP 48 saat içinde tükendi. </strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">İlgi bekliyorduk elbet ancak bu kadarını tahmin etmemiştik.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Gelen onlarca ""nasıl biter?"", ""neden 250 kopya bastınız"", ""bize de mi yok"", ""hiç mi yok"" sorularına  kayıtsız kalamadık. Merak ettik hızlıca bir anket yaptık: tekrar baskı LP mi yapalım, yoksa özel bir 45'lik mi, diye sorduk. LP isteyenler çoğunlukta çıktı, ama 45'lik soranlar da az değildi. </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Hal böyle olunca bir 250 LP daha basmak üzere kolları sıvadık bile. Aklımızda 45'likler de var... E nasıl yapalım edelim derken, ilk baskıya olan ilgi ve özellikle Istanbul dışından gelen mesajları da göz önüne alarak ""bu kez bir ön sipariş yöntemi izleyelim"" dedik. Hak geçmesin.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Maksat #Feedback serisi ile başladığımız yola, Taner ustanın teşviki ile devam etmek.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Ki ufukta onlarca proje var.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Buradan ön sipariş verecek olanlara türlü sürprizlerimiz de olacak elbet. Ama nihai amaç bundan sonraki projeler için de bir ağ oluşturmak.<br/> </p>

Bu satırları okuyanlar arasında Tantana Records'ın önceki yayınlarını ve #Feedback serisini takip edenler olsa gerek. The Ringo Jets, Eskiz, Cosmic Wings, Help! The Captain Threw Up ve Palmiyeler'in LP'leri yayınlarken bir nevi abonelik sistemi kurmuş, plak severleri bu genç projeler ile bir araya getirmeyi, ""yeni sesler"" için ""sürdürülebilir"" bir yayın serisi yaratmayı hedeflemiştik.  Fena da yol almadık hani.
Peşinden Taner Öngür ustadan ""o telefon"" geldi. Bize yeni projesinden, albümünden bahsetti, aramıza katılabileceğini söyledi. Dünyalar bizim oldu. Projeye hız verince koca yaz nasıl geçti biz de anlamadık.
İlk kez duyanlar için hızlı özet: Anadolu Pop’un anıt grubu Moğollar’ın kurucu efsanelerinden Taner Öngür’ün, 1920’ler ile 1970’ler arası taş plaklarda, kıyıda köşede kalmış İstanbul şarkılarını surf rock esintileriyle yeniden yorumladığı albümü “Elektrik Gramofon”u duyduk, bayıldık.
Siz de duyun, siz de bayılın diye Eylül ayı başında yayınladık.
 
İlk baskı 250 kopya LP 48 saat içinde tükendi. 
İlgi bekliyorduk elbet ancak bu kadarını tahmin etmemiştik.
Gelen onlarca ""nasıl biter?"", ""neden 250 kopya bastınız"", ""bize de mi yok"", ""hiç mi yok"" sorularına  kayıtsız kalamadık. Merak ettik hızlıca bir anket yaptık: tekrar baskı LP mi yapalım, yoksa özel bir 45'lik mi, diye sorduk. LP isteyenler çoğunlukta çıktı, ama 45'lik soranlar da az değildi. 
Hal böyle olunca bir 250 LP daha basmak üzere kolları sıvadık bile. Aklımızda 45'likler de var... E nasıl yapalım edelim derken, ilk baskıya olan ilgi ve özellikle Istanbul dışından gelen mesajları da göz önüne alarak ""bu kez bir ön sipariş yöntemi izleyelim"" dedik. Hak geçmesin.
Maksat #Feedback serisi ile başladığımız yola, Taner ustanın teşviki ile devam etmek.
Ki ufukta onlarca proje var.
Buradan ön sipariş verecek olanlara türlü sürprizlerimiz de olacak elbet. Ama nihai amaç bundan sonraki projeler için de bir ağ oluşturmak. 

Desteğiniz ve ""Abonelik"" fikri niçin önemli?
Keyifi değeri bir yana malum plak Türkiye şartları için maliyetli bir format. Oysa ki her gün onlarca  enfes grup kuruluyor, yeni isimler çıkıyor, yeni projeler kaydediliyor. Bütün bunların ""internet"" kanalıyla keşfetmek mümkün; ancak aynı internetin uçsuz bucaksız evreninde maceraya terk edilmeleri ise haksızlık. Plak bu manada ayrıca anlamlı ve değerli.  

#Feedback'in önceki paketlerinde ""sıradaki"" LP yayınının sınırlı sayıdaki renkli baskısını, yanında küçük hediyeler içeren bir paket halinde ""abonelere"" gönderiyorduk. Aynı yöntemi devam ettirmek mümkün; ""sıradaki albüm""ün ileride koleksiyon değeri olacak sınırlı sayıdaki kopyalarını buradan ön siparişe sunacağız.

<br/>Short Summary</h3> <p>Lester is nothing short of a legend.<span><br/></span></p>
<p>After performing with the Jamaican Military Band and Val Bennett, Lester began his career as a studio musician in the Jamaican music scene. It was in this venue that he met the other founding members of The Skatalites, his longest running project.</p>
<p>The Skatalites are now a household name in Jamaican music, after putting out 16 studio albums of their own, and accompanying many other famous artists.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Lester does not receive any royalties for his work with the Skatalites. Without any funding from his previous work, he is calling on his fans to help him bring his new record to life.</p>
<p>Lester has received the honor of an Order of Distinction in 1998 for his contribution to Jamaican music. He would love for his next honor to be your donation to the future of his music.</p>
<p>Help Lester and the production team create a new, amazing record that you'll listen to over and over again.</p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>For this production we'll need over $20,000.</p>

<div>We have some amazing personnel helping Lester make his album a reality, including:</div>
<ul>
<li>Joe Ferry, a longtime producer and collaborator with Lester and The Skatalites. He will be both playing on and producing the record. Joe's mulitiple Grammy award winning production style will give the music the production value it deserves.</li>
<li>Nathan Breedlove, formerly of the Skatalites and renowned jazz trumpeter, bringing his unique musical style to the album. Nathan is a Grammy nominated musician.</li>
<li>Rich Carlstedt, a member of the Israelites for 25 years, will be playing guitar on this record. After playing with Derrick Morgan, the Skatalites, Justin Hines, and Lord Tanamo, he's signed on to bring his rhythmic pulse and smooth licks to Lester's new sound.</li>
<li>Buddy Jay Kieffer, John England Fisher, Terence Paschal, Curtis Irie, and Joe Mineo will help complete the musical and production team, and help make this a record to remember.</li>

<p>I am singer/songwriter, 17 years of age from the city of Newcastle, NSW. </p>
<p>I began playing guitar in 2012. After practicing my instrument for 2 years I grew a passion for songwriting. I started to write my own material in March of 2014. I soon found that writing music became a part of my day to day activities, the more I wrote, the more I loved it. </p>
<p>In July of 2015 I took up vocal lessons at the National Music Academy. Quickly I began to improve my singing whilst writing more material.

<p>Since August, my passion for performing and confidence has grown immensely.

<p>I'm a musician from Montreal and I've been playing music in various bands (most notably Honheehonhee and Lakes of Canada) since I was 10 and my neighbour and I wrote our first masterpieces in my parent's unfinished basement.  After years of writing songs, singing in choirs and playing any instrument I could get my hands on,  I eventually continued my musical education at Concordia University where I graduated with a major in liberal arts and a minor in music.</p>
<p>This is my first attempt at a solo album.  It's called Notes From a Bedroom.  I recorded it in my bedroom on cassette tapes.  It's just me singing with an acoustic guitar and a bit of harmonica.  It's raw and honest.  I've been dreaming about it and working on it for years, busking in the Montreal metro to pay for it and now I want to share it with the world.  </p>
<p>I have lots of exciting ideas about how to do this, like a launch at the Queen Elizabeth Hotel in the same room John Lennon and Yoko Ono did their Bed-In for peace.  This is the site of the most famous bedroom recording ever made.  It just happens to be in Montreal and I'm going to rent the room and invite Yoko Ono and anyone else who happened to be in the room for the recording of ""Give Peace a Chance"".</p>
<p>Your contributions will help me with every aspect of getting this album out. Everything from, mixing and mastering in a proper studio to pressing cds to making music videos to touring in people's bedrooms (something I don't think has ever been done before) and documenting it (including the launch at the Queen Elizabeth Hotel), to straight up publicity costs. </p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<ul>
</ul>
<div>I'm looking for $15,000.  Here's why:</div>
<div>Mixing 2 days: $1,600</div>
<div>Mastering 1 day: $1,000</div>
<div>Music video: $1,000 or more</div>
<div>Renting a room at the Queen Elizabeth Hotel for launch with Yoko Ono: $800</div>
<div>CD Pressing with upc code and digital distribution: $1,248 </div>
<div>P2 visa and musician guild fees (to tour in the US): $825</div>
<div>Visas for film crew: $445</div>
<div>Bedroom Tour expenses (gas and room and board): $1,500-$2,000</div>
<div>Bedroom tour documentary (camera equipment and post-production costs): $2,500-$20,000 or more</div>
<div>Publicist: $1000-$5000 or more</div>
<div>
<b>Total</b>: <b>$11,918-$33,918</b> </div>
<div><span>Both totals are not including tax.  Basically, $15,000 is an estimate on the low side of how much it will cost to do all the things I'd like, if my talented film-making friends do a whole lot of work for free with the bare minimum of equipment and I eat nothing but peanut butter and pasta on tour.  If I raise less than that I just won't do some of these things (or I'll eat less on tour).  If I raise more, I'll put it towards paying my friends and more publicity and making the tour documentary and everything else even better.  If all my dreams come true I'll even be able to make vinyl!</span></div>
<div>But I'm not asking you to just give me money.  I have lots of perks to offer you. Depending on how much you donate you can get:</div>
<div>
<b>a copy of Notes From a Bedroom--</b>the album you're helping me make and share.</div>
<div>
<b>a copy of the Bedroom tour documentary</b>--this is one of the things I'm most excited about.  To keep in the style of the recordings and songs I'm going to be touring in people's bedrooms.  I don't think this has ever been done before (at least I've never heard of it) and my talented film making friends are going to come along and catch it all on camera!  You'll get a sneak peak of so many shows pushing the boundaries of intimacy with small audiences in people's bedrooms!</div>
<div>
<b>a copy of a page straight from one of my notebooks--</b>this is where it all started. In trying to write the songs for this album I filled a whole bunch of notebooks with all kinds of things.  Sometimes they were lyric ideas, sometimes they were just interesting or ridiculous or dark or intense thoughts I wanted to remember so I scribbled them down.   Sometimes they were private thoughts I never thought I'd share...</div>
<div>
<b>or even a private show in your bedroom for you and anyone you'd like to invite!--</b>this is what it's all about.  The reason I recorded these songs was to share them with people, to connect, and there's no better way to connect through music than in person through live performance.</div> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Notes From a Bedroom is an album about connection.  I'm a firm believer that the only way people can truly connect is if they're honest with each other.  I tried to delve into the depths of my mind, the private places I almost never share with people.  Sometimes the thoughts are dark; sometimes they're bursting with the joy and beauty of being alive.  I tried to be as honest as I could about my experiences and the thoughts that go with them in the hopes that a listener will be able to say, ""Yeah, I know that feeling!"" or ""What the F@&amp;# is he talking about?!"" Whatever your reaction is, I want to know.  </p>
<p>Beyond the writing I tried to keep the recordings honest too.  Everything was recorded at once.  All the tracks are me with an acoustic guitar (and some harmonica) singing and playing at the same time.  I did my best to play the songs well.  There are some mistakes; I wanted there to be.  In a world of perfectly polished digital music, Notes From a Bedroom is something real.  And the mood and feelings and sounds are all as close as I could come to what's in my head. </p>
<p>And now that the songs and recordings are done, I want to share them with the world.  I'm going to tour in people's bedrooms.  I've toured across the country many times before but I've never been as excited as I am about this! The shows will go from intimate and intense to laid back and fun.  I think they'll bring about memorable moments for both me and the audiences (as small as they may be). Your contributions will help me share this music with the world and see if there's anyone out there that has the same thoughts and feelings as I do, to know whether or not I'm alone.</p> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>There are many challenges I'll be facing as this project moves forward.  Recording an album is sort of funny.  You work for years and years practicing your instrument and writing songs and playing shows until you have something you think is really great and you record it.  Then you have to do a whole bunch of things that are related to music but they're not music.</p>
<p>I'm trying to organize a Montreal launch show at the Queen Elizabeth hotel in the same room John Lennon and Yoko Ono did their Bed-In for peace and I'm trying to invite Yoko Ono (if anyone out there knows Yoko, please let me know).  This was the site of the most famous bedroom recording ever (""Give Peace a Chance"") and it happens to be in my hometown! Obviously there are some variables that are out of my control in this plan but I'm giving it a shot and if it doesn't pan out I have some other ideas.  </p>
<p>I'm trying to book an entire tour in people's bedrooms.  Not only have I never done this, I don't think it's ever been done! But I'm doing it and so far people have been pretty open and interested and helpful and excited about the idea (Thank you all so much)! </p>
<p>I'm trying to make a documentary of this bedroom tour.  This is something I have almost no experience in but my extremely talented friends Matthew Raudsepp and Alex McCooeye are helping me and I have the utmost confidence in them (check out their web series ""The Plateaus"").</p>
<p>Basically it comes down to determination.  I want to get this music out into the world and it's going to happen one way or another.  I've got a lot of back up plans and no matter what I'll find a way to put your contribution towards sharing this music.</p> </div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<div>If you simply can't afford to contribute but you're interested in the project and you'd like to help, the best thing you can do is spread the word.  There's no counting  how helpful this could end up being.  Share this campaign on facebook and twitter and instagram and anywhere you can think of.  Go up to strangers on the street! Shout it from the rooftops! Sing it from your bedroom window! </div>

</h3>
<p>Folks, I have been sitting on these original song gems for too long. I've been doing other things, like recording albums with Graham Patzner (The Gospel Flats), making a baby, and writing more songs.  It's time that these songs be set free to do their work in the world, whatever that may be.  When I right a song, I am a channel that receives it and a mind that polishes it. I often don't know what the song is about or what it is ""for"" until much later. I do know that I don't continue to work on a song unless I sense that it is offering something new, and something helpful. The only way for these songs to do their job is to record them in a really beautiful way, so that nothing distracts from the message and the medicine in this music.   It would be selfish of me to hold onto these songs, or record them in a way that is less than optimal. You can help me get these songs to your own ears and to so many others' by contributing toward my Full Length album campaign. <br/></p>
</div> <div> <h3>The Songs:</h3>
<p>These songs are their own entities, and my relationship with them is 
such that they are now shouting at me to get them released, so I'm not 
going to argue with them any more.  Many of you are already familiar with some of these songs, and there are plenty of unheard compositions as well.  These are country and folk songs about family, apple trees, home, lovers, birth &amp; death, co-dependence, ceremony, and the end of the world. You know, just the basics. Some that you might know already are: <br/></p>
<p>The Songbird's Spell, <br/></p>
<p>The Whole Buffalo, <br/></p>
<p>An Experiment in Unconditional Love, <br/></p>
<p>Johnny, <br/></p>
<p>The Spider and the Sheriff, <br/></p>
<p>Rachel, <br/></p>
<p>Mother Sickness,</p>
<p>Gumption, </p>
<p>Good Ol'Fashioned Cheatin' Song<br/></p>

I am not only an artist, but also an experienced bookkeeper and businesswoman, so you can rest assured that I'll using each penny in a good way.  Here are some of the ways your contributions will be spent:</p>
<p>1. Studio time + Engineering at Bird and Egg Studio in Richmond, CA</p>
<p>2. Hiring local musicians to accompany me, photographers to document it, filmmakers to make a video for a single, artists to do album art and layout.</p>
<p>3. Mixing and Mastering (I'll keep you in the loop about where!)<br/></p>
<p>3. Beautifully crafted CDs, Vinyl, and download cards (and other merchandise yet to be decided)<br/></p>
<p>4. A Publicity campaign to promote the album release, so that it can get all the mileage that is possible. <br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
</div> <div> <h3>Risks<br/>
</h3>
<p>It is always a gamble when an artist ventures to offer something new.  Many of you will be selecting the Vinyl perk for your contribution. Since I'm using a flexible funding platform (I receive the money even if I don't make the entire goal), there is a chance that I won't have the funds to press the vinyl right away.  I will do my very best to make the entire goal so that this doesn't happen, but I'll take good care of you and your investment even if we don't make it all the way to $15,000 by offering you other perks along with your delayed vinyl pressing.  <br/></p>

</div></div>","The Album:

Folks, I have been sitting on these original song gems for too long. I've been doing other things, like recording albums with Graham Patzner (The Gospel Flats), making a baby, and writing more songs.  It's time that these songs be set free to do their work in the world, whatever that may be.  When I right a song, I am a channel that receives it and a mind that polishes it. I often don't know what the song is about or what it is ""for"" until much later. I do know that I don't continue to work on a song unless I sense that it is offering something new, and something helpful. The only way for these songs to do their job is to record them in a really beautiful way, so that nothing distracts from the message and the medicine in this music.   It would be selfish of me to hold onto these songs, or record them in a way that is less than optimal. You can help me get these songs to your own ears and to so many others' by contributing toward my Full Length album campaign. 
  The Songs:
These songs are their own entities, and my relationship with them is 
such that they are now shouting at me to get them released, so I'm not 
going to argue with them any more.  Many of you are already familiar with some of these songs, and there are plenty of unheard compositions as well.  These are country and folk songs about family, apple trees, home, lovers, birth & death, co-dependence, ceremony, and the end of the world. You know, just the basics. Some that you might know already are: 
The Songbird's Spell, 
The Whole Buffalo, 
An Experiment in Unconditional Love, 
Johnny, 
The Spider and the Sheriff, 
Rachel, 
Mother Sickness,
Gumption, 
Good Ol'Fashioned Cheatin' Song
and many more. 
I have at least 34 songs that I'd like to record, and only about 10 of those will make it onto the official album. The rest will be elegantly and simply recorded live onto a lengthy B-sides collection that will also be available.  
What I am asking for:
 I'm asking for $15,000, which is the minimum amount I need to do this album justice. I've seen enough musician friends ask for less than they need, and they

<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">The Story</span><br/>
</h3>
<p></p>
<p>For several years now I've been conceptualizing an EP that I hoped to be my first music project. Last October I was hanging out with some youth I was getting know from a local neighborhood in Charlottesville, VA. My roommate and I hold a bible study in my house with many of them, and they are very dear to our hearts. One of them was listening to some rap music and I asked him who it was by, and what it was about. He told me the artist's name and shared how the content was a story about a character living a life involving prison time, selling drugs, and other self-destructive practices. That’s when I came to the realization…”What am I doing?!” What am I doing with this God-given gift, when I have the opportunity to share gospel-centered, life-affirming, make you wanna two-step and bob your head HipHop?</p>
<p></p>
<p>Fast forward…It is a year later and I have been inspired to finish writing and recording Foreigners and not sit on this gift any longer. Since then I’ve gotten to share the songs with the kids, and many others, and I’ve already seen it be a blessing, challenge, and encouragement to those who have heard it. The kids love it! The gap between start and finish has been far too long. It's time that I got this thing done.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The more that I listen to this genre that I enjoy so much, the more I feel a longing for music that will point my face to Christ and the purpose that He has me here for. Foreigners is a seven song Hip-Hop project inspired by the walk of faith in Christ, in a land that is not your Home. It's formed from a faith and a sure hope in a kingdom that is yet to come. This is huge for me and I would love for you to join me in creating this hopeful HipHop experience.</p>
<p></p>
<p>My goal for this project is to raise $4000 in 30 days. And to release foreigners in early January. </p>

Lilly speaking, and I'm here to tell you all about my first solo album that I just started working on. More importantly, I'm here to tell you all about the ways in which you can be a part of it.</div><div>I've been a lover of music for as long as I can remember. Piano lessons as a kid, taught myself to play guitar when I was 16, and I've been singing for as long as I can remember. Life has a tendency to happen, though, as you get older, and mine made me walk away from music for almost a decade.

Lilly speaking, and I'm here to tell you all about my first solo album that I just started working on. More importantly, I'm here to tell you all about the ways in which you can be a part of it.I've been a lover of music for as long as I can remember. Piano lessons as a kid, taught myself to play guitar when I was 16, and I've been singing for as long as I can remember. Life has a tendency to happen, though, as you get older, and mine made me walk away from music for almost a decade. I picked it back up again last year, and looking back now, I don't know how I  ever lived without it. I started writing songs again, and before I knew it, I had more than enough material for a full CD.

<h3>G’day!</h3>
<p><b><i>The Girls From Oz</i> are a self-funded, Aussie (but London based), singing cabaret trio who entertain at corporate events, festivals, functions and cruise ships around the world. We started the group as an official business at the beginning of last year and since then we have gone from strength to strength and continue to grow. We are blown away by the opportunities we’ve been given over the past 12 months, which include performing at the Chartered Accountants of Australia and New Zealand event at The House Of Commons, the Australian Craft Beer Festival, The Perth Mint World Money Fair in Berlin, The London Legacy Anzac Day Gala Dinner at Australia House and the Australia-United Kingdom Chamber of Commerce Melbourne Cup Gala at Australia House to name a few. We also had a very successful run at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe last summer in order to promote our brand and develop our material further. </b></p>
<p><b>We have achieved a lot in the last 12 months, but we are currently trying to branch out into areas that we hope will benefit more people than just those involved in the group. Our crowdfunding campaign has been set up to help with this aim. Your contribution will help to expand the group further, to support us in becoming an advocate for Australian culture and music in the UK and around the world, and to create more work for people in the arts. We hope to achieve these things by doing the following: </b><b>Firstly, we want to hire more Australian and New Zealand musicians and singers for our group; secondly, we would like to incorporate other cultures into our cabaret shows, and thirdly, we want to return to the Edinburgh Festival Fringe this year but with a band! You can read more about these aims in detail below. </b></p>
<p><strong><u>Australian Artists in the UK</u></strong></p>
<p>In the beginning we simply envisioned a cabaret group with a great unique selling point, however, quite by fluke, we have become a vessel for <b>showcasing Australian talent in London</b> and we aim to continue in this direction. The group hires Australian (and New Zealand) singers and musicians to perform as part of the group. At present we have 9 singers and 3 musical directors who swap and change depending on availability, making it a flexible money earner for performers who are over here striving to achieve their ambitions within the entertainment sector.</p>
<p>We also have a close working relationship with the Australia-United Kingdom Chamber of Commerce who have not only hired <i>The Girls From Oz </i>to perform and host numerous events, but who asked us to source and supply other Australian talent based in London to perform at their very successful Australia Day Gala at London’s Waldorf Hotel earlier this year. We have since been asked to supply a similar service with other events and so would like to expand this angle of the business even further.</p>
<p><b><u>Working with Other Cultures</u></b></p>
<p>As well as being hired to perform at events and functions, we also produce our own cabaret shows throughout the year. Our aim is to invite acts from different cultures around the world to perform as guest artists showcasing their work within our shows. Last year we incorporated the Bagpipes into our Edinburgh Fringe show which was the inspiration for the idea. </p>
<p>Our most exciting potential collaboration is with an <b>Aboriginal band called <i>Bärra West Wind</i></b><i> </i>who have become well known with the help of Australian singer/songwriter <b>Gotye</b> in the documentary <i>WestWind </i>by Ben Strunin.</p>
<p><i>Bärra West Wind</i> are hoping to travel over to London later this year and we have been in conversation with them about a collaboration when they are here, provided we can cover their basic costs. We feel it’s important to show how multicultural Australia is, but we also feel it’s very important to share the culture of Australia’s original people which is what we wish to do with the <i>Bärra West Wind</i> band.</p>

<p><b><u>Edinburgh Band</u></b></p>
<p>Thanks to the people who supported last years Indiegogo Crowdfunding Campaign we were able to raise enough money to have band charts written for our unique arrangements of Australian songs. This year we are returning to the Edinburgh Festival Fringe to try out these new arrangements with our band! This will add an extra level of excitement to our show that we are very much looking forward to experiencing. </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Our ideal financial goal for covering these costs is £6,200. We have set our campaign target at only £4,000 for 2 reasons. Firstly, £4,000 is the absolute minimum we will need to get these projects off the ground. Secondly, if we reach our £4,000 goal on this Indiegogo campaign then the campaign becomes an InDemand project, which means we can continue to raise funds and build backer community even after our campaign ends. This will mean that we can continue to raise money for the group and may even be able to start investing money towards future guest artists, intergrating more cultures into our shows and perhaps put some money towards reaching a few of our long term aims such as recording an album. </p>
<p><u><b>Breaking it down in more detail:</b></u></p>
<p>To give a completely transparent overview of our costs, here is the list of our expenses. These are in order of what the crowdfunding money will go towards as we raise the money (ie. if we only raise £500 then it will go towards paying the Fringe Fee and a little towards the Fringe accommodation costs. If we go over our target then money will start covering the costs for a decent band wage for the Edinburgh shows as well as click tracks which we can then use for all of our future shows.) </p>
<p><b>£400</b> - The Edinburgh Festival Fringe participation fee</p>
<p>+</p>
<p><b>£1,000 </b>(=£1,400) - Accommodation in Edinburgh for the 3 Girls and our Music Director (this does not include accommodation for the band as we hope to use musicians who will already be in Edinburgh)</p>
<p>+</p>

<p>The Girls From Oz</p>
<p>????????????</p>
</div></div>","G’day!
The Girls From Oz are a self-funded, Aussie (but London based), singing cabaret trio who entertain at corporate events, festivals, functions and cruise ships around the world. We started the group as an official business at the beginning of last year and since then we have gone from strength to strength and continue to grow. We are blown away by the opportunities we’ve been given over the past 12 months, which include performing at the Chartered Accountants of Australia and New Zealand event at The House Of Commons, the Australian Craft Beer Festival, The Perth Mint World Money Fair in Berlin, The London Legacy Anzac Day Gala Dinner at Australia House and the Australia-United Kingdom Chamber of Commerce Melbourne Cup Gala at Australia House to name a few. We also had a very successful run at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe last summer in order to promote our brand and develop our material further. 
We have achieved a lot in the last 12 months, but we are currently trying to branch out into areas that we hope will benefit more people than just those involved in the group. Our crowdfunding campaign has been set up to help with this aim. Your contribution will help to expand the group further, to support us in becoming an advocate for Australian culture and music in the UK and around the world, and to create more work for people in the arts. We hope to achieve these things by doing the following: Firstly, we want to hire more Australian and New Zealand musicians and singers for our group; secondly, we would like to incorporate other cultures into our cabaret shows, and thirdly, we want to return to the Edinburgh Festival Fringe this year but with a band! You can read more about these aims in detail below. 
Australian Artists in the UK
In the beginning we simply envisioned a cabaret group with a great unique selling point, however, quite by fluke, we have become a vessel for showcasing Australian talent in London and we aim to continue in this direction. The group hires Australian (and New Zealand) singers and musicians to perform as part of the group. At present we have 9 singers and 3 musical directors who swap and change depending on availability, making it a flexible money earner for performers who are over here striving to achieve their ambitions within the entertainment sector.
We also have a close working relationship with the Australia-United Kingdom Chamber of Commerce who have not only hired The Girls From Oz to perform and host numerous events, but who asked us to source and supply other Australian talent based in London to perform at their very successful Australia Day Gala at London’s Waldorf Hotel earlier this year. We have since been asked to supply a similar service with other events and so would like to expand this angle of the business even further.
Working with Other Cultures
As well as being hired to perform at events and functions, we also produce our own cabaret shows throughout the year. Our aim is to invite acts from different cultures around the world to perform as guest artists showcasing their work within our shows. Last year we incorporated the Bagpipes into our Edinburgh Fringe show which was the inspiration for the idea. 
Our most exciting potential collaboration is with an Aboriginal band called Bärra West Wind who have become well known with the help of Australian singer/songwriter Gotye in the documentary WestWind by Ben Strunin.
Bärra West Wind are hoping to travel over to London later this year and we have been in conversation with them about a collaboration when they are here, provided we can cover their basic costs. We feel it’s important to show how multicultural Australia is, but we also feel it’s very important to share the culture of Australia’s original people which is what we wish to do with the Bärra West Wind band.

Edinburgh Band
Thanks to the people who supported last years Indiegogo Crowdfunding Campaign we were able to raise enough money to have band charts written for our unique arrangements of Australian songs. This year we are returning to the Edinburgh Festival Fringe to try out these new arrangements with our band! This will add an extra level of excitement to our show that we are very much looking forward to experiencing. 
 

What We Need & What You Get
Our ideal financial goal for covering these costs is £6,200. We have set our campaign target at only £4,000 for 2 reasons. Firstly, £4,000 is the absolute minimum we will need to get these projects off the ground. Secondly, if we reach our £4,000 goal on this Indiegogo campaign then the campaign becomes an InDemand project, which means we can continue to raise funds and build backer community even after our campaign ends. This will mean that we can continue to raise money for the group and may even be able to start investing money towards future guest artists, intergrating more cultures into our shows and perhaps put some money towards reaching a few of our long term aims such as recording an album. 
Breaking it down in more detail:
To give a completely transparent overview of our costs, here is the list of our expenses. These are in order of what the crowdfunding money will go towards as we raise the money (ie. if we only raise £500 then it will go towards paying the Fringe Fee and a little towards the Fringe accommodation costs. If we go over our target then money will start covering the costs for a decent band wage for the Edinburgh shows as well as click tracks which we can then use for all of our future shows.) 
£400 - The Edinburgh Festival Fringe participation fee
+
£1,000 (=£1,400) - Accommodation in Edinburgh for the 3 Girls and our Music Director (this does not include accommodation for the band as we hope to use musicians who will already be in Edinburgh)
+
£500 (=£1,900) - Travel costs to and from Edinburgh for the 3 Girls, our Musical Director, props, costumes and instruments. 
+
£400 (=£2,300) - Marketing Costs for the Edinburgh Fringe, our Pre-Edinburgh previews and the Bärra West Wind band. 
+
£300 (=£2,600) - Videoing and Editing of shows for future showreels. 
+
£900 (=£3,500) - Covering our Edinburgh Bands rehearsal fee
+
£500 (=£4,000) - Money towards guest acts.
(InDemand extras)
+
£1,600 (=£5,600) - Basic Band wage for the Edinburgh Shows. As always, it is a financial risk to take a show to the Edinburgh Fringe. The three Girls From Oz members and our Music Director who will be performing in Edinburgh are prepared to take the risk of making very little or even no money from the shows in order to try out new material and gain future work for the group, however, we do not feel it’s right to ask independent musicians to do the same, therefore, we want to make sure they will be getting at least a minimal fee for their hard work. 
+
£600 (=£6,200) - Click tracks made up to pad out our band. This will give our band a Big Band sound even when we’re playing venues that aren’t big enough for a full size band such as in our Edinburgh venue.

<h3>Who's Neon Animal?</h3>
<p>We are Neon Animal, a Rock 'n' Roll band based in London, UK.</p>
<p>Our debut album ""Bring Back Rock 'n' Roll from the Dead"" has been positively received by both fans and the press, having been featured on the ""Best of 2017"" CD of Classic Rock Magazine, as well as in the ""High Hopes"" section of the same publication in 2018.</p>
<p>Born in the vivid capital of England, offsprings of a long-lasting collaboration, Mark Thorn (Lead Vocals), Miguel Martins (Guitar, Vocals), Jonathan Gaglione (Bass, Vocals) &amp; Iv K. Lizz (Drums) met in the city's underground Rock &amp; Punk scene when their common disillusion with music's current sterilised state brought them together in a shared vision: a world where Rock 'n' Roll still ruled and carried in its sound the primordial feeling of danger &amp; magic that once promised to change the world as we know it.  For the past 2+ years we've been working hard together, touring around Europe &amp; the UK, developing our craft and sound whilst aiming to bring our shared vision to life: making the best, most genuine &amp; honest Rock 'n' Roll music we possibly can.</p>
<p>We are now committed to creating a killer, longer &amp; better follow up record and with your support, we will achieve this.<br/><br/>If you've got any doubts about the perks, delivery/release dates, or any other questions, please enquire to info@neonanimal.com</p>
<p>(Subtitles available in English, Spanish, Italian, French &amp; Portuguese on our campaign video).</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Our Goal</h3>
<p>We are aiming at raising £10,000 in order to record, mix, master &amp; promote the album and help us finance our Autumn/Winter European Tour in 2018.</p>
<p>In return for your support and generosity, we've prepared a lot of perks exclusive to this campaign, including Neon Animal music, goods &amp; experiences. No matter how much you can support us with, you'll get something in return that's worth your money! For £4 only you will have access to a digital download of our new EP ""God's Own Bastards"" (out late September) which is also included in all other perks. For £12, you'll get a limited edition Digipak of the EP signed by the band.  From £15 you can get your hands on a copy of the album you're helping us record as well as a personalised ""Thank You"" card from the band and your name on the album's credits. You can even get us to play a private gig for you at a reduced price. Or access the ultimate Neon Animal offer: an exclusive, single lifetime of Neon Animal releases (all future albums in every format) &amp; gigs for one single, generous advanced offer! Check the list out and you will find something that will suit you!<br/><br/>We will be updating the campaign as we go as well as uploading videos of us in the studio when recording the album in September!</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Why Indiegogo?</h3>
<p>With the advent of  the internet and file sharing platforms, the music industry has suffered a dramatic blow: big record labels seem to not be able to support artists as they did before, and a new solid model that enables new artists to emerge and be able to live for and off the music they make is yet to be set in place. This makes it harder for a new band to be able to make a living whilst working on their music &amp; talent.</p>
<p>Producing a professionally recorded album is still an expensive deal, and transforming a musical idea into a finished product still costs bands a lot more than it seems: from the recording session itself - which involves hiring quality recording studios &amp; engineers - to financing the mixing &amp; mastering of the album, a properly produced LP will easily cost in the region of a few thousand pounds, not considering printing of CDs &amp; vinyls.</p>
<p>As if that isn't enough, in order for new music to reach the world and for you to notice it, artists still need to invest some more money in shipping copies to radios, magazines, blogs etc... and once the record is finally out, the band will still need to be mindful of all of the costs associated with being out on the road for weeks to promote the release: buying/renting a van, gas, tolls, ferries, food &amp; accommodation - you name it!</p> <p>Without the financial advance of a label or their web of contacts, crowdfunding campaigns have become one of the few means of support available to musicians nowadays, one that still enables new bands to bring their vision to life and record the music they've worked so hard to create.</p>
<p>With your help &amp; support, we'll be able to make the record that we've been envisioning &amp; working so hard for in the past year - and we promise we won't disappoint!</p>

Nonetheless, these instruments, along with a few years of vocal training and my intuitive ability to tap into poetic self expression, provided the perfect musical foundation for the singer-songwriter I've become.  </p><p>I’ve explored a number of creative, artistic career paths in my life (food, photography, music) and there’s been a consistent theme behind my work: <i>beautiful healing</i>.  I’m at my best when I’m creating and then nourishing others with my creations. And the form of nourishment that I love to share and cherish most is Music. <i>Healing Music</i>.  Smooth, yummy sonic sounds that soothe your soul.  This is what I live for and long to share with all of you!</p><h3 style=""text-align: center;""> </h3><h3 style=""text-align: center;"">My Songs</h3><p>My heartfelt music speaks of hope, healing, and my personal journey of awakening. I write to make sense out of the insensible and in service to the downtrodden. I write to heal my own wounds. I sing because I love the way the vibrations feel as they resonate throughout my entire being. I share because I’ve witnessed your tears fall in sweet release after I’ve vulnerably bared my soul in front of you.  And that’s what keeps me going.  For it says to me the magic of my musical medicine is working!  </p><p>My songs are gifts from beyond myself that I’ve been blessed to receive as oracular transmissions for the upliftment of us all.  Several songs I’ve written have been first gifted to me in the dream state, which I then write down when I wake up.  Other songs just come out of nowhere and practically write themselves.  And many of the others I spend lots of time consciously crafting.  No matter how it happens, it’s a beautiful process every time!  I’m honored to be the receiver of so many song babies.  May these enchanting incantations I sing bring healing into our beings.  And may my songs be as much a healing balm for you as they have been for me.   </p><h3 style=""text-align: center;""> </h3><h3 style=""text-align: center;"">What I Need &amp; How You Can Help</h3><p>It’s through the collective support of your kind and generous financial donations I will be able to bring my music and passion for healing through Sound into the world!  The process of making a record is a costly endeavor if you don’t have the home studio or genius engineering skills to do it yourself (neither of which I currently have).</p><p>Through the collective power of crowd-funding I have the beautiful opportunity to bring into form the funds I need to bring my new album to life. By collaborating together in this way, we can all participate in awakening our SLEEPING GIANTs within to be the change makers we seek on this planet.</p><p>Here’s how I plan to use the funds I’m raising:</p><ul>

The time for her slumber to cease has come upon new dawning.” </strong></p><p align=""center""><i>(lyric excerpt from title track)</i></p><p>Just as a Giant Redwood Tree stoically stands in its elegant, breath-taking fullness, so too am I rooting deep and growing taller, unafraid to awaken into my potential and use my feminine voice as an instrument for change. </p><p>We are in the age of the great awakening.  My inner giant is beginning to rise.  I rise for all the times I’ve fallen before. I rise for those who are unable or afraid to.  I rise for ones that have had their power taken away. I rise for all who’ve fallen in ages before. And I rise in solidarity with those who too are rising.  I invite you to join me upon this journey of Awakening Giants.</p><p> </p><h3><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1540964475/avuhahijhhib47mekod1.png"" src=""""/></h3><h3 style=""text-align: center;""> </h3><h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Other Ways You Can Help</h3><p>Help can come in more forms than just money!!  Here are some other ways you can help awaken the Sleeping Giant:</p><ul>

Nonetheless, these instruments, along with a few years of vocal training and my intuitive ability to tap into poetic self expression, provided the perfect musical foundation for the singer-songwriter I've become.  I’ve explored a number of creative, artistic career paths in my life (food, photography, music) and there’s been a consistent theme behind my work: beautiful healing.  I’m at my best when I’m creating and then nourishing others with my creations. And the form of nourishment that I love to share and cherish most is Music. Healing Music.  Smooth, yummy sonic sounds that soothe your soul.  This is what I live for and long to share with all of you! My SongsMy heartfelt music speaks of hope, healing, and my personal journey of awakening. I write to make sense out of the insensible and in service to the downtrodden. I write to heal my own wounds. I sing because I love the way the vibrations feel as they resonate throughout my entire being. I share because I’ve witnessed your tears fall in sweet release after I’ve vulnerably bared my soul in front of you.  And that’s what keeps me going.  For it says to me the magic of my musical medicine is working!  My songs are gifts from beyond myself that I’ve been blessed to receive as oracular transmissions for the upliftment of us all.  Several songs I’ve written have been first gifted to me in the dream state, which I then write down when I wake up.  Other songs just come out of nowhere and practically write themselves.  And many of the others I spend lots of time consciously crafting.  No matter how it happens, it’s a beautiful process every time!  I’m honored to be the receiver of so many song babies.  May these enchanting incantations I sing bring healing into our beings.  And may my songs be as much a healing balm for you as they have been for me.    What I Need & How You Can HelpIt’s through the collective support of your kind and generous financial donations I will be able to bring my music and passion for healing through Sound into the world!  The process of making a record is a costly endeavor if you don’t have the home studio or genius engineering skills to do it yourself (neither of which I currently have).Through the collective power of crowd-funding I have the beautiful opportunity to bring into form the funds I need to bring my new album to life. By collaborating together in this way, we can all participate in awakening our SLEEPING GIANTs within to be the change makers we seek on this planet.Here’s how I plan to use the funds I’m raising:
$8,000 – Studio Time with Producer & Engineer
$1,500 – Additional Guest Musicians
$755 – Album Mastering
$1,500 – Album Art & Design
$1,500 – Promotion
$1,300 – Perk Fulfillment
$1,000 – CD printing
Total to Raise: $15,555 ‘Sleeping Giant’ InspirationThe name of my upcoming album is ‘Sleeping Giant’, named after one of the tracks on the album, which gives voice to both what I’ve been going through in my own life and what I’m seeing at large in the world.  It speaks to the awakening power house that lies within each one of us: “There’s a Sleeping Giant deep within my ancient inner knowing. The time for her slumber to cease has come upon new dawning.” (lyric excerpt from title track)Just as a Giant Redwood Tree stoically stands in its elegant, breath-taking fullness, so too am I rooting deep and growing taller, unafraid to awaken into my potential and use my feminine voice as an instrument for change. We are in the age of the great awakening.  My inner giant is beginning to rise.  I rise for all the times I’ve fallen before. I rise for those who are unable or afraid to.  I rise for ones that have had their power taken away. I rise for all who’ve fallen in ages before. And I rise in solidarity with those who too are rising.  I invite you to join me upon this journey of Awakening Giants.  Other Ways You Can HelpHelp can come in more forms than just money!!  Here are some other ways you can help awaken the Sleeping Giant:

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hi! We are Wrath Upon Eden from Phoenix, Arizona. The band was formed in 2010 by brothers Bobby, David, and Jerry Bryant. Shortly thereafter, the lineup was complete with Moses Lucero and Vinnie Espinosa. After a 2 year stint in the music scene, the band split up.</p>
<p>On January 18, 2017, Bobby Bryant passed away unexpectedly. We all decided to throw a Memorial Show in Bobby's honor. We all felt Bobby on stage with us that night and what was supposed to be a one off show, turned into us wanting to continue pushing forward with the band and write an album for Bobby titled, The Wake Of Tragedy. </p>
<p>We put our blood, sweat, and tears into writing and recording this album, but with that, plus merchandise comes expenses. Please help us achieve this goal by creating this album and getting merchandise made by contributoring to our album campaign. It means the world to us!</p>

<p>My name is <a href=""https://andrewbundy.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Andrew Bundy</a> - singer-songwriter based out of San Francisco, CA.

<p>This entire album is being produced and recorded by Trent Berry (<a href=""https://www.dreamrackstudios.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Dreamrack Studios</a>) and mixed by Jamieson Durr (<a href=""https://www.wallyshydeout.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Wally’s HydeOut</a>) at historic <a href=""https://www.hydestreet.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Hyde Street Studios</a> in San Francisco, CA. and an amazing collection of musicians (see 'Album Contributors' below). Though I have previously released music online it's all been simple piano/vocal arrangements so I'm excited to fully realize my songs with the addition of drums, bass, strings, horns, and additional vocalists.</p>

<p>I've previously shied away from putting together a studio album given the amount of work and money it takes to do it well.

If I fall short of my goal then I'll have to scale back on physical production, merchandise, and marketing to make sure we can complete production on any work-in-progress and possibly release these tracks as singles. </span></p>

Or would you rather just get the new music so you can listen to it by yourself on your computer, phone or vintage turntable? Perk, Perk, Perk!

 

I've previously shied away from putting together a studio album given the amount of work and money it takes to do it well. For this reason I've decided to leave my 9-to-5 job so I can dedicate my time and energy to making this EP great and subsequent release successful. Scary? Yes. Unpredictable? Absolutely! That being said, I have 16 years of corporate retail experience, 30 years of music experience, and an amazing network of creators, collaborators and advisors to help me out along the way. 
If I'm fortunate enough to exceed my $15K target then I'll be able to invest in some killer music videos (which are critical to expand reach through YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, etc.), record a couple of additional tracks that can be released as singles, and get my music out to a broader audience through additional PR and marketing. If I fall short of my goal then I'll have to scale back on physical production, merchandise, and marketing to make sure we can complete production on any work-in-progress and possibly release these tracks as singles. 
 


These are tough times and I realize you might believe in my album but have limited means to contribute financially. Here are other ways you can help me out:


Micro-donations - You can donate flexibly to my campaign through $1 increment Perks. No amount is too little and I appreciate any contribution you can make! 

Share this campaign with others - Help me spread the word by sharing this campaign with your friends, family, colleagues, etc.

Join my mailing list - This is completely free and will give you access to exclusive content. In addition you'll be the first to know about upcoming shows and events. Sign up here!


Download or stream my music - Digital downloads and streams on Spotify, Apple Music, Amazon Music, etc. help generate royalty income for songwriters and artists. 

Attend my shows - I love connecting with people through a live performance so visit my website or track me on Bandsintown to check out an upcoming concert.

<p><strong>THE SONGS</strong></p>
<p>Good songs are universal. My songs are personal, yet their themes relate to us all. Take my story song “Travel On Down The Line,” which portrays how we make friends in unexpected places. In this tune, wanderlust was stirred and the railroad man who made it all happen became a beloved comrade. The frustrating search for the perfect romance finds its outlet in another song, the comic “Commitment.” Then there’s the beautiful but haunting piece about “Timothy.” “The Road Without A Star” (which originally appeared in an off-Broadway musical) expresses our most despairing moments when we lack confidence, yet somehow trust that we will find the guidance we’ve been seeking. “Follow Your Heart” shows that the answer has been inside us all along. Then there’s the call for humanity to “Wake Up.” These are just several of the tunes, including the signature title, “This Song Is Meant For You.” I indeed wrote this song for you—for all of you. Listen to it in my “pitch” video.</p>
<p>These eclectic songs are written in many different styles: pop, theatrical, folk, light rock, even jazz, which will all be represented on my upcoming album. The melodies are memorable. The chords and arrangements are complex and rich. And the lyrics are meaningful, sometimes humorous, and always thought-provoking. The songs comfort, amuse, entertain, express deep feelings, and elicit deep feelings. Uniting the songs are the themes of love, connection, and the resiliency and hope of the human spirit. You will be moved, inspired and uplifted. Music has the power to do all these things. For decades, audiences have told me that my music is especially powerful.</p>
<p>These songs—five of which earned awards—deserve a voice. I realize that <i>now</i> is the time to present them to the world.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>ABOUT ME</strong></p>
<p>Music has always been essential in my life. I sang before I talked, began piano lessons at the age of four, and picked up the guitar when the instrument was still far too big for me. My most important musical influences were the baroque master J.S. Bach with his many chord changes and running bass lines, the musical theater genius of Rogers and Hammerstein, and great songwriters such as Carole King and James Taylor. For decades in New York City I honed my singing skills for a three-octave voice, earning my living playing in coffee houses and clubs. I also wrote the music and lyrics for two off-off-Broadway shows. During my free-lance jobs for Hospital Audiences Inc.—an organization that provided performers for institutionalized audiences—I saw how music could touch souls, whether they were elderly in nursing homes, bedridden patients in hospitals, or children with serious illnesses who lay quietly in isolated wards. Whenever and wherever I performed, my audiences and I always connected deeply with each other.</p>
<p>After I encountered some serious health challenges—including an agonizing period when I even lost my singing voice—I began a career in the healing arts and electromedicine, partly to help myself reestablish what I had lost. For a long time I earned my living as a counselor, and then as an internationally published writer in the fields of psychology and holistic health. I have never regretted those choices, but now my heart is urging me to complete a promise I made long ago to myself and to the many people in my audiences who loved my music: to professionally record my original songs. Now I am ready. I don’t want to see any more time pass before I realize my goal.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>WHAT YOU WILL BE FUNDING</strong></p>
<p>Your generous contributions will help produce this first debut album of twelve songs, called “This Song Is Meant For You” (after one of the song titles). Although I’ll play either piano or guitar on all songs, additional guitar and keyboard tracks from some very gifted musicians will give the album an even more versatile feeling, along with a fuller sound. The songs will also be enhanced with bass, drums/percussion, and other instruments. My own harmony vocals will be augmented by additional backup singers. Here’s what you’ll be paying for. It does not include the 5-8% rate I pay to Indiegogo.</p>           <i> Projected costs     TOTAL $12,410.00</i><p style=""margin-left:.5in;"">Recording studio time, editing, mixing, and mastering:                        $  5,760.00</p>
<p style=""margin-left:.5in;"">Supporting musicians (bass, additional guitar, additional keyboard, drums/percussion, flute, sax, backup singers):                                                                             $  3,800.00</p>
<p style=""margin-left:.5in;"">CDs (includes cases, liner notes, color cover, and graphic design): $  2,850.00</p>
<p>All funding I receive will go into the album’s production. I have every reason to believe that I will reach my goal, as fundraising events for previous projects (including a 1000+ page book on holistic medicine) have always been successful. Any funds in excess of what I need will be allocated toward my next two albums.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>A UNIQUE APPROACH TO RESONANCE</strong></p>
<p>This album will be available in two formats: as MP3 downloads, or a special 2-CD set. Both the 2-CD Set and Digital Deluxe packages will contain two sets of recordings. Why two sets? The first CD (or first set of MP3 files) will be tuned, like most commercially available music, according to the modern concert pitch of A=440 Hz. The alternate CD (and MP3 files) will be sonically adjusted to 8 Hz lower in pitch—the A=432 Hz tuning—which was commonly used as a worldwide standard before the year 1910. Eight hertz (cycles per second) may not seem like much, but to some people the effects of even that small increment feel profound. Those who prefer the A=432 Hz tuning profess that it is more compatible with the biological and energetic frequencies of the human body. I wanted to give my listeners a choice, hence the two CDs. The 440-Hz CD will allow musicians to more easily play their (fixed-tuned) instruments with the recorded tracks, while the 432-Hz tuning may literally resonate better with some people and be more pleasing for them to listen to.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>TIME FRAME</strong></p>
<p>Despite the difficulty in finding recording studios able to work with me in this current lockdown climate, I did manage to find a talented recording engineer, as well as a group of dedicated professional musicians, who strongly believe in my music and are eager to participate in this album project. The album should be ready to ship by or before December 2021.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>WHAT YOU CAN DO EVEN IF YOU CAN’T CONTRIBUTE FINANCIALLY</strong></p>
<p>If you cannot contribute, that’s okay—you can still help me by spreading the word! Indiegogo has a special “share” function that will allow you to do this easily. For those on social media (Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Mewe, etc.), share my gift of music with your family, friends, colleagues, and acquaintances.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>THANK YOU</strong></p>
<p>Thank you sincerely for your encouragement and support in helping me fulfill a lifelong dream. My life’s purpose has remained consistent throughout my many career paths: to help others heal, whether that healing is through touch, talking, the written word, or music. I trust that in the music you hear, you will receive what I intended—and hopefully much, much more.</p>

<p>Hey, Matt Brooker here!</p>
<p>For those of you who don’t know me, I am a classically trained musician that has recently set my sights on becoming a professional jazz singer. Relatively new to Atlanta, GA, I have lived here somewhere around 4 years. In 2017 I was introduced to the Piano Bar at Campagnolo (campagnoloatl.com) and began my adventures singing publicly on a regular basis and really finding my voice. Soon after, in 2018, I performed in shows at a local venue, TEN Atlanta, with Robert Ray (the Piano Bar player) and then started my own gig at Olive Bistro, singing every Sunday. </p>
<p>Fast forward to March of 2020.  The pandemic seemed to take all of that momentum from me overnight. I couldn't really find my voice singing on livestream and, of course, I couldn't sing anywhere publicly, which affected me in ways I wasn’t ready for. I took it in stride, remembering that over the past year each and every person on earth has been affected by the global outbreak... and that just blows my mind. I know that this has had a personal impact on every single one of my friends, and especially the relationships between them.</p>
<p>As the world is coming out of lockdown, I have decided that now is the time to write my first album. I have learned so much about myself and my relationships with friends and family, and I know there are even more stories that will inspire my music. I need to reconnect with my circle of people and really find out what they went through and what their perspective is. </p>
<p>I have asked friends and family to share their stories with me through a video diary, and I want people to find strength in sharing their truths. Some of these stories will be a part of a series called Pandemic Perspectives. I will then create new music and curate an album that includes the inspiration I find resonating in their stories.</p>
<p>People Being People. </p>
<p>The reason I created this Indiegogo Campaign is simple: recording an album is expensive. Now, I have been able to make a down payment to get the ball rolling, but I have quite a ways to go. I am only asking for donations from those who feel comfortable doing so, knowing that everyone in my circle has been affected in different ways.</p>
<p>What We Need &amp; What You Get</p>
<p>I need to raise $12,000 to complete the funding for the album. This will cover the cost of the following:</p>
<p>• Professional music charts to accompany the songs I will write for this album</p>
<p>• The musicians, piano, bass, drums, as well as a few colorful moments with sax, strings and backup vocals. This includes recording time and rehearsal time!</p>
<p>• Three days at an award winning recording studio (800east.com)</p>
<p>• Our amazing Producer for this project (Dunlop Productions)</p>
<p>• Sound Engineers </p>
<p>• Professionally video taped portions of the recording process</p>
<p>• Album Cover Photography</p>
<p>• CDs to be made for distribution </p>
<p>Donation Gift Levels:</p>
<p>$25 - Digital Download of the Newly Released Album</p>
<p>$50 - Digital Download, a CD and a Signed Copy of the album Artwork</p>
<p>$100 - Digital Download, a CD, a Signed Copy of the album Artwork and a Custom </p>
<p>Happy Birthday Video within one year of project completion</p>
<p>$250 - I will come and sing Happy Birthday for your event!  Or, if you are not within a </p>
<p>local travel radius, I will livestream my performance via your preference of video </p>
<p>call.</p>
<p>$500 - A one hour Live Performance at your venue with professional Tracks (just like </p>
<p>Sundays at Olive Bistro!)</p>
<p>$1,000 - I will come to your event and give a 3-hour performance with live music (piano)</p> <p>*All Donations over $100 receive a VIP pass to the Album Launch Party! This includes access to the VIP Bar (shorter lines!) as well as the FREE Signature Cocktail! </p>

Born in Kingston, Jamaica, he spent the earlier years of his life living in the challenging community of Arnette Gardens, an experience that marked him and made him commit to leaving such a harsh context while promising to give back to the community that originally saw him grow as a person.These hard times led Nesbeth to find in music a way to express his thoughts, feelings and values, and to be an artistic advocate of the social change that he saw was necessary. These values were also very important to Ann Marie, Nesbeth’s cherished soul mate. Ann Marie was known as a loving mother and wife, who had enough love for everyone and in particular  with her children, She was a woman of faith who also believed that music could help reshape the world to be a fair and happier place. Ann Marie and Nesbeth were on the same journey they had a great love for life, music, family and a better tomorrow.</p><p>Since she has passed away, Nesbeth remains connected to Ann Marie through an unending love that is now on its way to being expressed in a reggae-infused music album where all the values that they both shared are addressed through powerful reggae vibes for individual growth and social change that you can dance to.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1517349724/ufuxexvfb8ezdfzfpbeb.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1518535992/wtwahyhz3man9pde4zzt.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p><strong>A Lesson On Moving On</strong></p><p> </p><p>Nesbeth has also been able to turn his tribulations into something good. As a single parent, he had to find the strength to ensure the couple's children had the love, support, and stability that they needed to move forward, honoring their mother's memory with bravery and positive steps toward their future. As hard as it was for their children to cope with losing their mother, Nesbeth has been able to help them go through such an impacting experience in a way that has ultimately been constructive. Also, Nesbeth has been providing a solid example as a socially conscious artist who didn't lose his way despite such a turbulent time and he even became an even more influential example among the many young fans who follow his work. Indeed, <strong>Nesbeth has been a living example of what moving on while keeping a loving memory forever alive should be all about, </strong>inspiring thousands of people, namely those who are younger and more vulnerable, to keep stay strong, grounded on positive values, and to never stop pursuing their dreams and aspiring  to have a happy and meaningful life. The A.M.E.N. album is definitely also the coronation of this vital life lesson that the Jamaican artist has both learned and sought to share with others.</p><div>

<h3> </h3>
<p>This first “<b>en pleine lumière</b>” album represents the beginning of a new chapter in my life, and feels very much like I have found my life’s mission. </p>
<p>Having trained and worked professionally in the world of classical music for a great number of years, throughout my career I have focused nearly exclusively on studying, performing, and teaching the works of male composers. This has been fairly standard practice in the classical world. Only recently have I considered looking more deeply into why this is, and whether there may in fact also have been brilliant and masterful female composers throughout music history. </p>
<p>I began by researching piano music by composers born in the 19th century, and right away realized that <i><b>of course</b></i> there were many women who composed at least as masterfully as their male counterparts. It feels like discovering that a fabulously decorated and designed wing of a house has unbeknownst to me always existed; in the house that I have lived in my whole life!</p>
<p>By pre-ordering CDs or digital downloads of the album, and by contributing to this campaign, you become an important part of the production of this album. My dearest hope is that this beautiful music will be heard by many listeners, and that bit by bit these composers’ names and compositions become part of standard repertoire. </p>
<p>As you may know, recording an album is a hugely expensive endeavour. In my experience, it usually works out to around $10,000 CAD.

</div></div>","This first “en pleine lumière” album represents the beginning of a new chapter in my life, and feels very much like I have found my life’s mission. 
Having trained and worked professionally in the world of classical music for a great number of years, throughout my career I have focused nearly exclusively on studying, performing, and teaching the works of male composers. This has been fairly standard practice in the classical world. Only recently have I considered looking more deeply into why this is, and whether there may in fact also have been brilliant and masterful female composers throughout music history. 
I began by researching piano music by composers born in the 19th century, and right away realized that of course there were many women who composed at least as masterfully as their male counterparts. It feels like discovering that a fabulously decorated and designed wing of a house has unbeknownst to me always existed; in the house that I have lived in my whole life!
By pre-ordering CDs or digital downloads of the album, and by contributing to this campaign, you become an important part of the production of this album. My dearest hope is that this beautiful music will be heard by many listeners, and that bit by bit these composers’ names and compositions become part of standard repertoire. 
As you may know, recording an album is a hugely expensive endeavour. In my experience, it usually works out to around $10,000 CAD. The costs include rental of the recording venue and instrument, and the fee for the recording engineer/producer/digital masterer, and these are the expenses that this funding campaign will cover.

Music has always been my first passion, beginning with picking up a guitar at six years old, guiding me all the way through my degree in Percussion Performance and Composition. This current project, Nomad, is my second album under the pseudonym Jelliflow. After composing, executing, and releasing my album Cosmic Waltz completely on my own, Jelliflow is taking a huge step up! I have assembled a wonderful team of vastly talented creators to help manifest Nomad— both the album and its film counterpart. Nomad tells the story of a man’s journey to cope with the loss of his lover in a tragic accident wherein he holds himself responsible for her death; he wrestles with the guilt, grief, and loss of her as he embarks on a quest to spread her ashes in their final resting place. I wrote this album as a way to lay my childhood to rest, to capture the reality of coping with change and growth. Sometimes it’s ugly. Sometimes it’s loud. No matter what, it’s a feeling that affects everyone. I wanted to create this world for Nomad, both visually and musically, to bring that isolating journey of growing up into a story everyone can connect to.</p><p>Jelliflow had so much support and love for Cosmic Waltz, but the magnitude of Nomad means we really need your help. Our funding goal of $16,500 will cover the cost of studio time, travel, lodging, production and equipment costs, as well as compensating our hardworking cast and crew. We want this album to be the best it can be, to be a breath of fresh air in the artistic world, and we want each and every one of you to be a part of the final product!</p><p>Everyone involved in Nomad so far has already put in so much brilliant work to bring you an epic journey on the album and on the screen. Your support means so much to us and everything we are creating.</p><p><br/>Music and art have been my passion for as long as I can remember. I have given so much personally to this album; my goal is always to create real, genuine art, my heart and soul poured out for all to connect with. I aim to create the caliber of art I want to see from others, to ignite the best and boldest creativity, to breathe new life into the artistic community and hopefully inspire people to challenge their own boundaries. Nomad is a way to push the envelope, for myself and all who find it. I feel this is an important story to anyone who has ever dealt with loss, frustration, loneliness, depression, rebirth, even growing pains; to those who took those lessons and fearlessly move head-on into life; to those that never give up on the journey even without knowing the destination.</p><p>Annelise Smithmier is an actress, writer, producer, director, and editor; she creates the behind the scenes and promotional materials behind Jelliflow, as well as co-writing the story and characters within Nomad alongside me. She has been serving as my right-hand lady throughout the production process so far, covering everything from story to makeup to blooper reels. She has appeared in a wide range of productions over the last several years, including the New York Fringe Festival, and will be leading next in The Rain Sessions with Bottle Alley Theater Company in Austin. She says, “This is the largest and most complex piece I’ve ever worked on and I am wildly passionate about it! Nomad has demanded the most of my creative ability, making it incredibly fulfilling, both artistically and personally. Our team has driven this around the clock because we all believe in how special this project is. I can’t wait to show all of our hard work and touch lives with this story!”</p><p>Sam Lustig is our main man for Visual Effects and Compositing. He says, “I am so excited to be a part of this project. It's an ambitious one, for sure. The visual storytelling, combined with an album equal in it's ability to drive the narrative, has kept me motivated. I can't wait for the world to see what we've created.”</p><p>Mia St.Clair is an accomplished model who has worked across the country, everything from fashion to avant-garde character modeling, and acts as our lead director of marketing and public relations at Jelliflow. She helped start this process and is excited to be a literal acting part of this journey.</p><p>Our director, Larissa Garcia-Baab, is well known in the Austin artistic community as a hardworking and diligent creative. She has partaken in numerous works around the country both on and off screen as a film and theater writer as well as some shorts and commercial work. She adds, “Directing is truly what I believe I was put on this earth to do, and the beauty of this project, and, honestly, most film projects, is that is was born out a pure, communal desire to make the best possible product. I am humbled and proud to lead a group of talented, hilarious, and dedicated artists in our pursuit to tell a story that is at once familiar in its telling, but new in its execution. In short, it's rad to do what you love, especially with some of the best in the game”</p><p>Our director of photography, Jasper Heins, owns his own company JJ Cinematography, is well accomplished in the Montana advertisement community and for working with a wide range of musicians. He adds, “This project pushes me creatively and technically as a DP, which is the best thing to come out of any project. I thank Ian and my crew for making me a better creative and I can't wait to for everyone to see what we have in store”</p><p>Aaron Martin captures all of our aerial footage courtesy of his company, Vivid Northwest as our First AC/ Drone Operator. He adds, “This project is the PERFECT environment for me. As First AC, creating a technical efficiency (on and off camera) brings me pure bliss. When the weather permits, I'm the Drone Operator. Supplying emotion-driven aerial cinematography is my favorite way to showcase the beautiful earth we live on.</p><p>A new perspective at the right time can open many doors to happiness”</p><p>Ian is an accomplished model, actor, and musician, signed with multiple agencies nationwide. After releasing Cosmic Waltz in 2016, he has been an icon in the Austin fashion circuit.</p><p>Jelliflow is armed with an apt and intelligent crew, each a master of their own craft. We have already conquered challenges along the way—everything from long hours to nasty weather to flesh wounds—but we have overcome them all as a team. Moving forward challenges will be more frequent, but even the exhaustion of making this world as vivid as it can be is worth it to each individual involved. Our purpose is to create great art, no matter the cost.</p><p>Money isn’t the only form of support you can give!

It's an ambitious one, for sure. The visual storytelling, combined with an album equal in it's ability to drive the narrative, has kept me motivated. I can't wait for the world to see what we've created.”Mia St.Clair is an accomplished model who has worked across the country, everything from fashion to avant-garde character modeling, and acts as our lead director of marketing and public relations at Jelliflow. She helped start this process and is excited to be a literal acting part of this journey.Our director, Larissa Garcia-Baab, is well known in the Austin artistic community as a hardworking and diligent creative. She has partaken in numerous works around the country both on and off screen as a film and theater writer as well as some shorts and commercial work. She adds, “Directing is truly what I believe I was put on this earth to do, and the beauty of this project, and, honestly, most film projects, is that is was born out a pure, communal desire to make the best possible product. I am humbled and proud to lead a group of talented, hilarious, and dedicated artists in our pursuit to tell a story that is at once familiar in its telling, but new in its execution. In short, it's rad to do what you love, especially with some of the best in the game”Our director of photography, Jasper Heins, owns his own company JJ Cinematography, is well accomplished in the Montana advertisement community and for working with a wide range of musicians. He adds, “This project pushes me creatively and technically as a DP, which is the best thing to come out of any project. I thank Ian and my crew for making me a better creative and I can't wait to for everyone to see what we have in store”Aaron Martin captures all of our aerial footage courtesy of his company, Vivid Northwest as our First AC/ Drone Operator. He adds, “This project is the PERFECT environment for me. As First AC, creating a technical efficiency (on and off camera) brings me pure bliss. When the weather permits, I'm the Drone Operator. Supplying emotion-driven aerial cinematography is my favorite way to showcase the beautiful earth we live on.A new perspective at the right time can open many doors to happiness”Ian is an accomplished model, actor, and musician, signed with multiple agencies nationwide. After releasing Cosmic Waltz in 2016, he has been an icon in the Austin fashion circuit.Jelliflow is armed with an apt and intelligent crew, each a master of their own craft. We have already conquered challenges along the way—everything from long hours to nasty weather to flesh wounds—but we have overcome them all as a team. Moving forward challenges will be more frequent, but even the exhaustion of making this world as vivid as it can be is worth it to each individual involved. Our purpose is to create great art, no matter the cost.Money isn’t the only form of support you can give!

<p><strong>Who is ""Blake""?</strong><br/>Hi, I am Blake Reynolds and I am a Christian Music artist, song writer, worship director, multi-instrumentalist! Currently residing in Cedar Springs, MI! Oh and I love dogs, so I bet we already have something in common. </p>
<p>Thank you for your support by listening to my current music. No Other Name (Studio and Acoustic Version) and my other cover songs.<br/><br/><strong>THE PROJECT</strong><br/>This project is more than just ""<i>another song</i>"", it is apart of the next chapter and a new step in my life. I have done music ""seriously"" for 12 years but have not been professionally pursuing it to make it my full-time gig until about 1 year ago. My heart is to write music that will reach people wherever they are at in life and that they would be changed by the power of Jesus,  whether they are just down after a stressful day or they are at the end of their rope, I want my music to reach them. I have had my own struggles in life, depression, hopelessness, and I know how much the right words, right person, the right music, the right message (God), etc can help a person with their struggles. I want to give that message to people through my music.</p>
<p>Being that I am an independent artist, I rely on my job and fundings from people like yourself to make projects like this happen. Ordinarily, I would save money or use ""credit"" but I am taking a new and huge step in life and want to keep my focus on the ""writing/production"" of the project, which is why I need people like <strong><u>you</u></strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Why You <u>SHOULD</u> Fund My Project</strong><br/>This project is just the beginning but will make a huge difference in the lives of so many people across the world.

You being apart of my project will allow you that chance to make a difference in someone's life (lives) with the message that you are helping me to give. </p>
<p><strong>How <u>YOU</u> Can Help</strong><br/>As I had mentioned before,  this project is a huge deal and my goal is to reach thousands to millions of people with the music I produce/write, which you are taking apart of by giving towards this project.

<h3>What's Up, Y'all!</h3>
<p>For those of you I haven't had the pleasure of meeting, my name is <strong>Elijah Mann </strong>(but you can call me Eli). I'm a Boston-Grown/Austin-Based singer/songwriter. I graduated from Berklee College of Music two years ago, and since then have been making music in/around venues, living rooms, and busy street corners in cities across the country. I've been releasing daily covers on Instagram for about a year now, garnering praise from artists such as Luke Wade, Lakes of Canada, and Carly Rae Jepsen.</p>
<div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/Lz_JigRfySc?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div>
<div> </div>
<p>I'm about to embark on my next big project: <strong>My new EP, ""The Flooding Season"" and it's supporting tour!</strong></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Details</h3>
<p>This June, I will be going into the studio with producer/songwriter/all-around rock star <strong>Phlip Coggins </strong>to record a bunch of new songs for y'all. This album is centered on the feeling of change and transition, needing to belong somewhere, not just anywhere.</p>
<p>In support of this albums release in October, I will be teaming up with Bay Area folkster and fellow beanie enthusiast <strong>Hailie Hay </strong>to mount a <strong>month-long tour of the East Coast and Texas! </strong>We'll be hitting the road with a band full of my closest friends and favorite musicians, hitting up a city near you! Who knows, we may just be playing with your favorite band!</p>
<p>Like most things in this currency-based world of ours, it takes a bit of money to mount such a production. We're looking at somewhere around <strong>$12,000</strong>. That would pay for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Booking The Studio</li>
<li>Hiring Musicians/Engineers</li>
<li>Distribution</li>
<li>The Tour Van</li>
<li>Gas</li>
<li>Food</li>

<div> </div>
<h3>And That, My Dear Friends, Is Where You Come In</h3>
</div>
</div><div>
<p>For the next <strong>30 days</strong>, I will be asking for your donations to fund this album and this tour. We'll be offering up <strong>CDs, buttons, posters, handwritten notes/lyrics, exclusive videos, invites to hang with all of us before or after gigs</strong>, and <i>multiple </i>opportunities to be <strong>personally serenaded by me</strong> in the living room/office/coffee shop/street corner/public restroom of your choice! If there's something you want that you don't see offered, hit me up! I'm ready to hook you up with great merch and incredible experiences.</p>
<p>Thank you all so much in advance for helping fund this project that is so near and dear to my heart. I cannot do this without you, and I cannot wait to get started. Let's have some FUN!</p>

<p><i><strong>HERE's WHERE YOU COME IN: </strong></i></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>I need $5000 (minimum) to complete this project.  Interplay Records handles the post production, packaging, and distribution.  That means I get to spend ALL of it on RECORDING &amp; MUSICIAN fees, licensing and mixing SOUND.  </strong></li>
<li><strong>WHAT YOU GET:  Besides ETERNAL GRATITUDE and the PRIDE &amp; THRILL of helping us PRODUCE a timeless wonder and a hard copy of the finished CD in your HAND and EARS, and other great PERKS: A HOT CANDLELIGHT BATH WITH ME!! Mp3 downloads! Candles!  Chocolate &amp; Truffles!  Morning Coffee, Tea &amp; ME!! An Italian Candlelight Dinner! Autographed photos and personalized sheet music!   A chance to meet the band and me at Capitol Records when we record (contingent on the success of this campaign)!  And of course, YOUR NAME inside the CD Cover!  </strong></li>
<li><strong>Bragging Rights!  You get to say ""I helped make this CD, I helped her get to Japan!""</strong></li>
<li> </li>
<li><h3><strong>THE IMPACT</strong></h3></li>
</ul>
</div><div><ul>
<li><strong>A CD of stories set to MUSIC that will live on long after you and I are gone.</strong></li>
<li><strong>TIMELESS: having NO BEGINNING and NO END. </strong></li>
<li><strong>UNIQUE: having no LIKE or EQUAL. One of a kind. As in NO ONE sounds like me. </strong></li>
<li><strong>SOUL CANDY: Raw, emotional vocals, and rhythmic, melodic SOUND, music for the WORLD's EARs and YOURS. I will pull you close, lean you in, groove you, flow through you, make love to your senses, HEAL YOU. THAT IS THE IMPACT I intend to HAVE on hearts &amp; souls.  Covers, yes, but also ORIGINALS which reveal the secret, raw ME,  EXPOSED in BROAD DAYLIGHT.  I'm petrified to be so vulnerable.  I am exhilarated and ready to go there.</strong></li>
<li> </li>
<li><h3><strong>And just so you know...I have a lil experience at this..so you're in good hands...</strong></h3></li>
<li><strong>My first CD, 'DYATRIBE', (Itunes, Amazon, Soundcloud) was totally self-produced. I did not have a management or PR team behind me, yet, we gained much traction on the national and international Pop/Jazz music &amp; radio scene. DYATRIBE was picked up by Interplay Records (USA, Japan, EurAsia) &amp; also distributed by Whole Foods Markets USA.  Featured on the CD was Grammy bassist Ryan Cross (Beyonce's 'Lemonade'), grammy drummer Lyndon Rochelle (Esperanza Spalding), as well as the genius of one of thee most gifted pianists on the scene today, ROBERT TURNER (Stevie Wonder, Alicia Keys).  (<a href=""http://www.robertturnerpiano.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.robertturnerpiano.com</a>).  We covered an eclectic blend of songs including Radiohead's 'Pyramid Song', the Beatles 'Eleanor Rigby' &amp; 'Come Together', Jobim's 'How Insensitive' &amp; Miles Davis's 'All Blues' - all RE-arranged by myself &amp; Robert Turner.  Aside, from selling many CD's at LIVE SHOWS in LA, I also saw incremental income from online streaming downloads.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Scott Yanow of the L.A. Jazz Scene Newspaper said of Dyatribe: "" Continually intriguing ...with a top notch rhythm section...atmospheric modern jazz...inventive scatting...""  And James Janisse, the ""Gentleman of Jazz"" wrote ""The musicianship is right in the pocket...and Dyan's phrasing is impeccable."" </strong></li>
<li><strong>Here's some buzz from fans: <a href=""https://www.dyankanemusic.com/buzz"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.dyankanemusic.com/buzz</a></strong></li>
<li><strong>Yes, we have a few covers on the 2nd CD.  The newly completed first single ""I Can't Make You Love Me"" (Bonnie Raitt) which features a lush &amp; velvety pop/jazz arrangement by yours truly, with Robert Turner's on the Motif, programming keys, guitar, bass, strings &amp; drums;  flute by Louis Van Taylor (Ray Charles, Kool &amp; the Gang), and percussion by Victor Orlando ('Outstanding' - Gap Band).  A FUNK'D UP arrangement of the classic 'CARAVAN'.  A soulful rendition of 'SOPHISTICATED LADY' (so sad). </strong></li>
<li><strong>AND!!!  We will also record a few of my ORIGINALS: ""Dial Rio for Me"", is a sexy, wistful ballad where I beckon an old 'friend' who's between lovers to come by and knock da boots in that special way we used to do.  In another hip-hop flavored jazz tune ""U Got Nothin' on Me"", I tell my hit-man/lover to drop the action for one night, cut the lights, and 'show ya right'.  And with the lilting, waltzy, Monkish ""Poppy's Back in Town"", a young woman is enamored with an O.G. who stashes &amp; crashes in the back of her crib after a bowl of his favorite 'black-eyed bean soup'!  I'm also so excited to record my latin-flavored treat that asks the Lord to make that man 'Please Stay', one that will have you up on the dance flo fo sho! The modal jazz underpinnings I like to use never alienate the listener, but instead, yield to a soulful pop-ness that appeals to all ears of all ages, without losing the connection to jazz music.</strong></li>
<li><strong>During the 8 weeks this campaign is up and running, we'll be busy rehearsing, so we'll be ready to roll into the studio on Day 1.  JOIN ME!  You don't want to miss this exciting adventure - to be in on this CD from the ground up.</strong></li>
</ul></div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>I cannot wait to finish this project &amp; I will set a release date, but I warn you, I will be taking my time to get it RIGHT.  So if there's any delay in getting product to you, it will be for that reason only.  The devil is always in the details.  SOUND. THE MIX.  SOUND.  THE MIX.  SOUND. THE MIX...</strong></li>
<li><strong>If you make your donation, but we come up short of our $5000 goal. NO WORRIES.    There's many ways to record on a budget.  I know how to stretch a dollar to produce a quality project.  We may have to forfeit recording at Capitol, hire non-grammy  musicians, switch sound engineers, use my iphone instead of a LIVE videographer &amp; photographer.  No sweat.  I WILL GET IT DONE. And you will receive all perks relative to your donation.</strong></li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Some peeps just can't contribute actual DOLLARS but want to be part of the moment.  Here's some other ways to help:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>SPREAD THE LOVE.  Make some noise. SHARE THE NEWS!  Ask folks to get the word out about my campaign. SHARE IT ON SOCIAL MEDIA.</strong></li>
<li><strong>JOIN MY TEAM and fundraise WITH ME, FOR ME.</strong></li>
<li><strong>BECOME a MATCHING DONOR!  OR SUGGEST ONE!  Approach a CEO  or company, a local business, a store owner, a neighbor.  Ask if they'd like to MATCH whatever we raise to DOUBLE it!</strong></li>
<li><strong>FIND or BECOME a SECRET SPONSOR towards a portion of the goal!</strong></li>
<li><strong>Buy my CD DYATRIBE, and/or DOWNLOAD MY MUSIC - all at ITUNES!!</strong></li>
<li><strong>Don't trust fundraiser sites?  Paypal is always a good option.  Or a check in the mail is doable.  Venmo is another way to go.  Got a piggy-bank full of coins?  Works for me!  Good ole fashioned CASH in HAND will do, too. </strong></li>
<li><strong>AND check out all the Indiegogo share tools! </strong></li>
<li><strong>Your prayers, positivity, support, kind words: PRICELESS!</strong></li>

   Flanked by an amazing ensemble of stellar soldier musicians who vibe with my equal parts DRIVE, EMOTION, OBSESSION & PASSION, I stand on the shoulders of giants, ready to take it to the next level.  
I JUST NEED TO RECORD THE MUSIC.  ONCE FINISHED, WE TOUR JAPAN!!!

Autographed photos and personalized sheet music!   A chance to meet the band and me at Capitol Records when we record (contingent on the success of this campaign)!  And of course, YOUR NAME inside the CD Cover!  
Bragging Rights!  You get to say ""I helped make this CD, I helped her get to Japan!""
 
THE IMPACT


A CD of stories set to MUSIC that will live on long after you and I are gone.
TIMELESS: having NO BEGINNING and NO END. 
UNIQUE: having no LIKE or EQUAL. One of a kind. As in NO ONE sounds like me. 
SOUL CANDY: Raw, emotional vocals, and rhythmic, melodic SOUND, music for the WORLD's EARs and YOURS. I will pull you close, lean you in, groove you, flow through you, make love to your senses, HEAL YOU. THAT IS THE IMPACT I intend to HAVE on hearts & souls.  Covers, yes, but also ORIGINALS which reveal the secret, raw ME,  EXPOSED in BROAD DAYLIGHT.  I'm petrified to be so vulnerable.  I am exhilarated and ready to go there.
 
And just so you know...I have a lil experience at this..so you're in good hands...
My first CD, 'DYATRIBE', (Itunes, Amazon, Soundcloud) was totally self-produced. I did not have a management or PR team behind me, yet, we gained much traction on the national and international Pop/Jazz music & radio scene. DYATRIBE was picked up by Interplay Records (USA, Japan, EurAsia) & also distributed by Whole Foods Markets USA.  Featured on the CD was Grammy bassist Ryan Cross (Beyonce's 'Lemonade'), grammy drummer Lyndon Rochelle (Esperanza Spalding), as well as the genius of one of thee most gifted pianists on the scene today, ROBERT TURNER (Stevie Wonder, Alicia Keys).  (www.robertturnerpiano.com).  We covered an eclectic blend of songs including Radiohead's 'Pyramid Song', the Beatles 'Eleanor Rigby' & 'Come Together', Jobim's 'How Insensitive' & Miles Davis's 'All Blues' - all RE-arranged by myself & Robert Turner.  Aside, from selling many CD's at LIVE SHOWS in LA, I also saw incremental income from online streaming downloads.
Scott Yanow of the L.A. Jazz Scene Newspaper said of Dyatribe: "" Continually intriguing ...with a top notch rhythm section...atmospheric modern jazz...inventive scatting...""  And James Janisse, the ""Gentleman of Jazz"" wrote ""The musicianship is right in the pocket...and Dyan's phrasing is impeccable."" 
Here's some buzz from fans: https://www.dyankanemusic.com/buzz
Yes, we have a few covers on the 2nd CD.  The newly completed first single ""I Can't Make You Love Me"" (Bonnie Raitt) which features a lush & velvety pop/jazz arrangement by yours truly, with Robert Turner's on the Motif, programming keys, guitar, bass, strings & drums;  flute by Louis Van Taylor (Ray Charles, Kool & the Gang), and percussion by Victor Orlando ('Outstanding' - Gap Band).  A FUNK'D UP arrangement of the classic 'CARAVAN'.  A soulful rendition of 'SOPHISTICATED LADY' (so sad). 
AND!!!  We will also record a few of my ORIGINALS: ""Dial Rio for Me"", is a sexy, wistful ballad where I beckon an old 'friend' who's between lovers to come by and knock da boots in that special way we used to do.  In another hip-hop flavored jazz tune ""U Got Nothin' on Me"", I tell my hit-man/lover to drop the action for one night, cut the lights, and 'show ya right'.  And with the lilting, waltzy, Monkish ""Poppy's Back in Town"", a young woman is enamored with an O.G. who stashes & crashes in the back of her crib after a bowl of his favorite 'black-eyed bean soup'!  I'm also so excited to record my latin-flavored treat that asks the Lord to make that man 'Please Stay', one that will have you up on the dance flo fo sho! The modal jazz underpinnings I like to use never alienate the listener, but instead, yield to a soulful pop-ness that appeals to all ears of all ages, without losing the connection to jazz music.
During the 8 weeks this campaign is up and running, we'll be busy rehearsing, so we'll be ready to roll into the studio on Day 1.  JOIN ME!  You don't want to miss this exciting adventure - to be in on this CD from the ground up.

Risks & Challenges

I cannot wait to finish this project & I will set a release date, but I warn you, I will be taking my time to get it RIGHT.  So if there's any delay in getting product to you, it will be for that reason only.  The devil is always in the details.  SOUND. THE MIX.  SOUND.  THE MIX.  SOUND. THE MIX...
If you make your donation, but we come up short of our $5000 goal. NO WORRIES.    There's many ways to record on a budget.  I know how to stretch a dollar to produce a quality project.  We may have to forfeit recording at Capitol, hire non-grammy  musicians, switch sound engineers, use my iphone instead of a LIVE videographer & photographer.  No sweat.  I WILL GET IT DONE. And you will receive all perks relative to your donation.

<h3>""Singles"" </h3>
<p>""Singles"" is my new full length album, a collection of songs previously released to the world as 'singles'. The album also contains three brand new songs, which I am totally stoked about! I've been very fortunate on this musical journey to have met some great people, all the fans, friends and mentors that I've encountered along the way that have been so encouraging and supportive, even in the times that were challenging. Throughout that inspired support,  somehow all these songs have either charted on Billboard both in Canada and the US, have been the recipients of music industry awards, or featured in films and television shows. This has all happened while I remain an independent artist, something I'm very proud of! And as my journey continues with this new album ""Singles"", I'd love to have your continued support to help me reach my goal with this cool Indiegogo campaign!  </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Exclusive Content and Unique Items</h3>
<p>I wanted to be able to provide my fans and supporters with the exclusive content and unique items that go hand-in-hand with a crowdfunding campaign backing an album. All Perks include a Digital Download of the album.</p>
<p>This is a way to preorder my latest CD and exclusive items you can only get through this campaign.</p>

""Singles"" is my new full length album, a collection of songs previously released to the world as 'singles'. The album also contains three brand new songs, which I am totally stoked about! I've been very fortunate on this musical journey to have met some great people, all the fans, friends and mentors that I've encountered along the way that have been so encouraging and supportive, even in the times that were challenging. Throughout that inspired support,  somehow all these songs have either charted on Billboard both in Canada and the US, have been the recipients of music industry awards, or featured in films and television shows. This has all happened while I remain an independent artist, something I'm very proud of! And as my journey continues with this new album ""Singles"", I'd love to have your continued support to help me reach my goal with this cool Indiegogo campaign!

<p>Bonjour, je m’appelle Christine et je représente le groupe musical sherbrookois, Fragile Fantôme.</p>
<p>Fragile Fantôme c’est un groupe qui a débuté à l’été 2016 à partir d’une association entre l’auteure, Mélanie Noël, le musicien, Charles-Emmanuel L’Espérance et moi-même.  Par la suite, nous avons intégré le claviériste, Andy Bourgeois et le batteur, Antoine Pomerleau Anctil pour nous accompagner lors de nos spectacles.  Depuis, ils font partie à part entière de ce projet. </p>
<p>Fragile Fantôme c’est un groupe de musique originale où nous mélangeons différentes sonorités empruntées à la musique pop, électronique et rock.  Depuis l’été 2016, nous avons donné de nombreux spectacles dans lesquels nous avons ouvert  pour plusieurs groupes et artistes émergeants. Aussi, nous avons eu la chance d’assurer la première partie de l’artiste, Yann Perreau lors de son dernier passage au théâtre Granada au mois d’octobre 2016.  Au printemps dernier, nous avons gagné une bourse de 60h de studio.  Nous avons alors  entamé le processus d’enregistrement d’un mini album aussi appelé, EP, chez Replix Studio.  Présentement,  nous en sommes aux derniers moments d’enregistrement avant d’envoyer notre travail au mixage.</p>
<p>C’est à ce moment que nous faisons appel à votre soutien financier pour nous aider à terminer la production de ce mini album de 6 chansons.  Les sous amassés serviront à payer le temps et l’ingénieur pour le mixage et le matriçage, l’impression de la pochette, ainsi que la distribution sur toutes les plateformes web telles que Spotify, Google Play, itunes et apple music.  Aussi, votre aide soutiendra tout ce qui concerne la promotion de ce mini album.</p>
<p>La production d’un mini album c’est une étape importante dans la vie d’un groupe émergent.  Elle lui permet de créer de nouveaux contacts dans l’industrie musicale et le milieu artistique.  Ce EP va être envoyé dans les stations de radios à des fins de diffusion.  Il va aussi nous servir de carte de visite pour soumettre notre musique à d’autres groupes et artistes afin de créer de nouvelles collaborations.  De plus, il nous permettra de postuler à différents comités de sélection de festivals et de concours afin de faire partie de leur prochaine programmation.</p>
<p>Chaque personne ayant offert un don de 10$ ou plus, revevra un album qui lui sera remis le soir du lancement ou envoyé par la poste les jours suivant sa sortie.</p>
<p>Nous comptons réellement sur votre appui pour nous permettre de terminer la production de ce mini album et d’assurer la continuité de notre groupe qui est Fragile Fantôme.</p>

<p><strong>Short Summary</strong><br/>My name is Liam Rogers. I'm 19 years old from Lake Orion, Michigan.</p>
<p>I'm not the greatest at talking about myself. But my work speaks for me.</p>
<p>I make music that I believe to be universally healing to all. It's unique and yet strangely familiar. It speaks truth. I've released several projects already on platforms such as iTunes, Spotify and Google Play, but I am a full time student and have no time apart from the hours I currently work.</p>
<p>I am not one to ask for handouts, it takes a lot for me to request any financial assistance. But my work is something I know truly helps people, and I want to continue doing so.</p>
<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong><br/>I need approximately $10,000.</p>
<p>This not only covers studio time, but equipment I would need to keep creating music away from the studio for future projects.</p>
<p>Over the last year, I have been converting a short bus into a totally self sustainable home for myself. It is equipped with 2 beds, sink, toilet, eating space and electricity powered by solar panels. Thus why this third album will be appropriately titled ""From a Bus"". I plan on dedicating that space as a traveling studio. I am a free spirited individual, I am attending film school to pursue my love for motion pictures, and I currently have 2 EPs and 2 Singles available on all streaming platforms.</p>
<p><strong>PERKS FOR DONATING INCLUDE:</strong></p>
<p>Donations of $25 or more will receive a signed ""Spectrums, Vol. 1"" CD completely free via postal service.</p>
<p>Donations of $50 or more will receive a signed ""Spectrums, Vol. 1"" &amp; ""Spectrums, Vol. 2"" CD via postal service, completely free with a limited edition album sticker.</p>
<p>Donations of $100 or more will receive a signed ""Spectrums, Vol. 1"", ""Spectrums, Vol. 2"", &amp; ""From a Bus"" CD via postal service, and 2 limited edition album stickers (if goal for funding has been met)</p>
<p>Donations of $500 or more will receive all that has been offered below, plus I will personally write and create a song about anything, or anybody of your choosing and send it to you once I have raised the money for equipment. It will be good, it will be carefully thought out and well done, or your money back. </p>
<p>Donations of $1000 or more will receive everything below, plus I will create another song about anything or anyone of your choosing (once funding goal is met)</p>
<p>Donations of $5000 or more will receive all of what has been offered below, plus I will personally call you and arrange a bus trip for myself and a surprise guest to come to your area (within the continental United States) and have you on a video talk show inside the bus for YouTube. We'll make music, talk about life, get some good food. Whatever you'd like!</p>
<p><strong>The Impact</strong><br/>Again, my music speaks for itself. I promise if you listen to my projects in order, at least one song will seriously move you in ways no other current music ever could, you have my word. I believe in good, I believe in universal love, and following not only what you love doing in this world with your heart, but planning it out thoroughly with your mind. As much as I'd love to say its a dreamer's game, you need to know how to properly nurture your future in something once you start it. That is music for me. I love connecting to others in ways I could never otherwise, it provides a purpose for me when others feel heard and understood through my songs. I only desire to continue that and having the ability to support myself and my people while doing so.</p>
<p><strong>Risks &amp; Challenges</strong></p>
<p>We've all had monumental darkness in our lives. My story is no different. I simply wish to convert that darkness into light for others. Music is my outlet. Instead of explaining it all here, my email is LCR55.Mail@gmail.com. If you feel you need to know more about me and my objectives, we can setup a phone call within the same week or so you email me. </p>
<p><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong><br/>If you can't donate that is totally ok! I'm a man of hard work. Just because I am asking for help does not mean I am sitting somewhere lounging. I go to school full time, and all other time is spent working for funding towards my goals. </p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Melodic rock band, Stage 11 blends Singer/Songwriter sensibilities with dynamic alternative rock energy. The band was formed in LA as an acoustic trio in 2009 by Diego Garcia (singer/guitarist), Dusty Arth (guitarist), and Evan Michael Hart (drummer/percussionist/singer). Joined by Billy Ray Dyer on bass in 2011 and by Matthew Fennelly on lead guitar in 2013. </p>
<p>This campaign is designed to help us finish our first professionally produced record with our full, 5 piece, line-up. The EP ""Moments Like These"" which we've been tirelessly working on over the last few months.

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Music is a big part of the human experience. With so many permutations you could say it is the world's most accessible art form. As long as people are around music will be there and new music will continue to be created. We are one of many indie acts who just want to make our brand of music part of the tapestry. As a contributor to our project you will help further the progress of music and take ownership in its history. If you have been with us from the beginning we thank you for the support and we are excited to give you the album you've been waiting for. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>As an artist, there are never any guarantees of fame and fortune, no matter how much you put into your work. But if you're proud of the result, that makes it worth the effort.</p>
<p>There is always the possibility of unexpected production costs but we are bound and determined to get this record finished.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Want to help but can't contribute financially? Share this campaign with as many people as you can. Indiegogo has some pretty convenient share tools for just that reason. Beyond that, you can even call radio stations and request our music. Any way you can spread the word is greatly appreciated.</p>
</div></div>","Short Summary
Melodic rock band, Stage 11 blends Singer/Songwriter sensibilities with dynamic alternative rock energy. The band was formed in LA as an acoustic trio in 2009 by Diego Garcia (singer/guitarist), Dusty Arth (guitarist), and Evan Michael Hart (drummer/percussionist/singer). Joined by Billy Ray Dyer on bass in 2011 and by Matthew Fennelly on lead guitar in 2013. 
This campaign is designed to help us finish our first professionally produced record with our full, 5 piece, line-up. The EP ""Moments Like These"" which we've been tirelessly working on over the last few months. Never before have we been able to achieve the high production value that we are already hearing from this time around in the studio. This is due to the high caliber producer and engineer that we have been fortunate enough to be working with.
This is huge for us because it gives us the chance to share with the world music that we're proud of. It gives you the opportunity to be part of our story by pre-ordering your own copy of ""Moments Like These"" along with receiving some other unique perks.​

<h3>JAZZ FOLK</h3>
<p>I have long had a keen interest in folk music because of the raw emotion in it. I love listening to field recordings from around the world. Jazz is also a music I love because of the freedom of expression through improvisation that it gives me. I create music that mixes elements of both genres. </p>
<p>One of my tunes is called, “Sea Shanty” in which I utilize the melody of the traditional sea shanty, “What Shall We Do with the Drunken Sailor?” while adding my own melodic and harmonic content. I take inspiration from composer Aaron Copland, who quoted cowboy songs in his work, “Billy the Kid” and the old Shaker song, “Simple Gifts” in his work, “Appalachian Spring.” I employ a similar method as Copland, but in a Jazz rather than Orchestral setting. Another of my original compositions is titled, “Baby Babble.” The song developed out of actual nonsense syllables that I heard a baby utter. You can listen to a sextet arrangement of it at the link below. It begins around 26:48.</p>

<li>Album artwork</li>
<li>Registering copyrights of original music and/or arrangements</li>
<li>Food for the musicians at the recording session</li>

They are very fortunate to have a teacher like Juliana Reina. I hope to see the concert in person soon. My best energy for this important event. ""Irina Gorin - Russian pianist and pedagogue, creator of the ""Tales of a Musical Journey"" method""I am honored and touched by the fact that my music is premiered in the wonderful city of Bogota, Colombia! I greatly appreciate the work of Juliana Reina Tellez, her great students, Master Camilo Rojas Vallejo and members of the orchestra. My compositions are reflections of my life.  I wanted to be a composer, after my first piano teacher, Rosalia Molodietzkaya told me that the great composers are immortal and that every time I play their music I bring them back to this world. So, I'm sure I will be present in spirit when my music is performed in Bogota! ""Alexander Peskanov - Russian-Ukrainian pianist and composerFor this reason, this year we would like to expand the landscape and undertake a more ambitious concert with greater musical, artistic and logistical challenges. We want to hold the concert in the Fabio Lozano Auditorium, one of the largest auditoriums in Bogota. With a capacity of almost 600 people and ideal acoustics, it becomes a dream scenario for all our team.  How can you help us?Achieving such an ambitious project requires many elements which lead to different costs: auditorium, orchestra, handbills, advertising, orchestration of works, editing and printing of scores, among others.Our goal is to raise US$4,500 which we would use to:
Payment of orchestra musicians
Symphony percussion rentals for the concert
Recording and editing video of the concert
 Your support is critical to undertake this great journey. We want to keep dreaming big and prove  that it is possible to make professional music with children and young people, who are the future and identity of our country. You can also support us by sharing this campaign through social networks and with everyone you know and think may be interested in supporting this initiative.Thank you very much!",5.0,6,"1 Campaign

My name is Jake (a.k.a. Zer0 Gravity) and I'm a rapper. I've been rapping for quite a long time now, and I put out my first album in the summer of 2016. As proud as I was of my album, there was something that seemed off about it; the beats weren't high-quality and it was poorly mixed and mastered (by me).</p><p>I'm currently in the process of making my sophomore (second) album, titled ""707"", named after the dorm room I live in at college. My goal here is to make an album that truly sounds good; something that actually fits in with the music that I hear on the radio.</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1484168681/vcgdpevvwwjrgyy280yu.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: center;"">Here is the potential album art for my album ""707""</p><p>This album will be free! It will be on streaming services like Spotify and Apple Music, but will also be free on platforms like Soundcloud and Bandcamp.</p><p><strong>Phase 1</strong></p><p>This is a project that will be done in phases. The first phase will go towards buying instrumentals. Phase 2 will be focused on the mixing/mastering aspect of my album. Because mixing/mastering is further down the line, I decided to split my project up into two phases. If I can get past the first phase, I will actually be able to get to work on my album, and when the time comes I will start phase 2.</p><p><strong>Why Me?</strong></p><p>Great question. Why would you throw your hard-earned dollars at some internet rapper that sounds like everybody else? Well, the answer to that is simple.</p><p>I don't sound like everybody else. </p><p>This song below is about how I am who I am except for the part where I say ""R.I.P Zer0 Gravity"". I was gonna change my rap name but I was convinced not to, so just ignore that.</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><a href=""https://soundcloud.com/zer0gravityrap/i-am"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://soundcloud.com/zer0gravityrap/i-am</a></p><p>When I started making music, it was my goal to stick out. I have never wanted to conform to the industry standards of rap, with content covering money, women, and drugs. In fact, I have barely talked about any of those topics. On my last album, I talked about my own anxiety, global issues, my life in general, and other things. I plan to continue this trend on my next album. In fact, I've already written many of the lyrics for it and I can say with confidence that I have not strayed from my original tone. However, the way the album sounds will be completely different.</p><p><strong>What's Special About My Album?</strong></p><p>So many great questions.</p><p>Rap is a very saturated industry comprised of dark songs. It's filled with explicit references towards loads of bad things that I'm not a huge fan of talking about. The beats all sound the same too! So many standard trap beats (lots of hi-hats, heavy bass, 808's, synthesizers, etc.) dominate the airwaves nowadays, and I've gotten a little bit weary of all of it. My favorite kind of rap is something that I'm cheesily going to call ""Happy Rap"". This is a kind of rap music that makes you smile, that makes you feel good. I want to make this music. </p><p>I've been inspired by people like Chance the Rapper and the younger Kanye West to use beats that often utilize samples (usually soul samples) from other songs to create songs that not only sound unique but also make the listener feel good. All I've ever wanted to do was help people in some way or another. Fun fact, if rap doesn't work out, chances are I'll become a therapist so I can do just that.</p><p><strong>Why Do I Need Funding?</strong></p><p>I don't have much money. I'm a college kid and I spent my summer working at a summer camp. I did what I could, but I'll be honest, I would not suggest working at a summer camp if you're trying to make a lot of money. In order to make an album that actually sounds good, I need two things; beats and mixing/mastering. The mixing/mastering will be taken care of at a later date during a phase 2 campaign. Phase 1 (This phase) will be focused on attaining beats.</p><p>I will be purchasing beats from multiple sources. I have found many beats that have piqued my interest, but these beats cost money. When buying beats, the producer gives the buyer (me) multiple options for what level I want to purchase.</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1484165295/hypjfqug04cak94jqinv.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><i>This is an example of the options</i></p><p>The first and the cheapest would be to get mp3 files of the beats. These files are not of the highest quality and are not good enough for a high-end album. The next option is the wav file, which is what I will end up actually using. Wav files themselves are not too expensive, but the story doesn't end there. I will also need to purchase the trackouts of each beat.</p><p><strong>What is a Trackout?</strong></p><p>Let's say you made a song. Your song would have different instruments, maybe a piano, a violin, some drums, and of course, your voice. Each of these instruments will have its own track. </p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1484165376/ymuwpxfttkv7ttqlljri.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><i>Example of multiple tracks</i></p><p>These tracks can be individually manipulated in order to make the final mix of your song sound perfect. For example, if your voice sounds too bassy, then it could be possible to chop out some of the bass aspects of your voice. If your violin has really high pitched squealing sounds when the bow moves across the strings, you can cut out the ""high-end"" to get rid of these sounds. How does this relate to trackouts?</p><p>If all that I had from a beat that I purchased was the beat itself, I would not be able to individually alter the instruments. I would not be able to send the song to a company to get it properly mixed. With trackouts, the mixing company will be able to incorporate my voice within the beat as opposed to having to layer my voice over the beat. This may sound kinda weird, but trust me it makes a difference. So, in order to make an album with the quality I want, I need to get trackouts.</p><p><strong>Funding Pt. 2</strong></p><p>I do not plan on getting the exclusive rights to the beats because, honestly, I would love to hear what other people make over the beats that I use. Also, exclusive rights for beats ranges from low-end prices to way too high (like, in the thousands). The price of unlimited distribution beats with trackouts really varies, so I gave myself $1500 to fund the beats. I would estimate that, on average, the price of the beats I would be getting would be around $75 each. I will not even be getting the full $1500 because of Indiegogo fees. If there is money left over, I will use it to begin funding for Phase 2.</p><p><strong>Logo</strong></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1484168976/tsntowydcikg38cc47gd.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: center;"">Zer0 Gravity Logo</p><p>For those of you who gave enough to get some Zer0 Gravity merch, here's the logo!</p><p><strong>Thank You!!</strong></p><p>You have no idea how much this means to me.

<h3>Who are we?</h3>
<p>Bhakta Project was born in Cali-Colombia in a very special place called Shyam Ashram. Here our band leader and composer Camilo invited a group of friends and musicians to collaborate on the songs that he had been writing for many years. His compositions combine a modern musical language with the ancient vibration of mantras. Add all the different musical styles that each member brings and that is Bhakta Project.</p>
<p>Early in our short history we recorded our first album that has opened up doors and opportunities for us to play around Colombia. But we have been working really hard on our new music, reaching into our ancestral native rhythms and exploring harmonies and melodies to express our deepest consciousness of peace, love and union.  </p>
<p>That is why we are so excited to be asking for your help to take this music into the studio and out to your lives. So we can share all the love we have put into this project. We are planning on visiting the best studio in Colombia, ""Audiovision"" and recording with some great engineers and producers so we can give you all the best music that we can deliver. Real music, recorded live, so you can feel what it is like to be in one of our concerts.</p>
<ul></ul>
<p>If you could come to one of our concerts you could experience a very ancient practice called ""Kirtan"". Because we are not interested in just hearing ourselves sing. Our music is composed to share the singing experience with the audience. In our concerts you are as important to the music as we are, and if we can make this new album a reality we hope to be touring next year through the US, South America and Europe to bring Bhakta Project to all of you.</p>
<h3>Funding</h3>
</div><div>
<p>This is the first stage of creating this album. For this moment we are asking our friends and fans around the world to help us get into the Studio on June 22nd to June 25th. Because recording the music is the most important stage of producing a record we want to do it right. We want to really make the music in the studio and not in the editing room after that. For that we are hoping to raise $3.000 USD.</p>
<p>What will this investment cover:</p>

<li>Travel Costs to Bogotá-Colombia (Where the studio is)</li>
<li>Studio Time (3 days) AudioVision Studio <a href=""http://estudiosaudiovision.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://estudiosaudiovision.com/</a>

</div></div>","Who are we?
Bhakta Project was born in Cali-Colombia in a very special place called Shyam Ashram. Here our band leader and composer Camilo invited a group of friends and musicians to collaborate on the songs that he had been writing for many years. His compositions combine a modern musical language with the ancient vibration of mantras. Add all the different musical styles that each member brings and that is Bhakta Project.
Early in our short history we recorded our first album that has opened up doors and opportunities for us to play around Colombia. But we have been working really hard on our new music, reaching into our ancestral native rhythms and exploring harmonies and melodies to express our deepest consciousness of peace, love and union.  
That is why we are so excited to be asking for your help to take this music into the studio and out to your lives. So we can share all the love we have put into this project. We are planning on visiting the best studio in Colombia, ""Audiovision"" and recording with some great engineers and producers so we can give you all the best music that we can deliver. Real music, recorded live, so you can feel what it is like to be in one of our concerts.

If you could come to one of our concerts you could experience a very ancient practice called ""Kirtan"". Because we are not interested in just hearing ourselves sing. Our music is composed to share the singing experience with the audience. In our concerts you are as important to the music as we are, and if we can make this new album a reality we hope to be touring next year through the US, South America and Europe to bring Bhakta Project to all of you.
Funding

This is the first stage of creating this album. For this moment we are asking our friends and fans around the world to help us get into the Studio on June 22nd to June 25th. Because recording the music is the most important stage of producing a record we want to do it right. We want to really make the music in the studio and not in the editing room after that. For that we are hoping to raise $3.000 USD.
What will this investment cover:

Travel Costs to Bogotá-Colombia (Where the studio is)
Studio Time (3 days) AudioVision Studio http://estudiosaudiovision.com/

Studio Engineer
Producer

Any funds that reach over our goal we will spend on post production for the record :)

Purpose
Bhakta is a collective endeavour, where all of those involved hope to experience and help others experience compassion, love and peace. In times when the whole world is within our reach but somehow we push each other further and further away, music like this can help heal our wounds and see those around us with kinder eyes.

<h3>About the Barons</h3>
<p>The L.A. Swing Barons were launched in 2015 to bring authentic 1930s style Kansas City jazz to Los Angeles area and beyond.  The great swing dancers of the golden age of swing all knew that the best band to dance to was the great Count Basie Orchestra, and the L.A. Swing Barons were created to capture that spirit.  Founded by musicians who also know how to swing dance, our music will always be sure to capture that essential element that made the swing era bands so dance-able. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>About the recording</h3>
<p>After two years of playing together, it is time to take the music to the next level and put down a recording.  Your contributions will secure you a copy of the recording and a number of interesting perks.</p>
<ul>
<li>All together we are looking to get about $10,000 to completely finish the recording.</li>
<li>These fees will go towards:<ul>
<li>Paying the musicians for their rehearsal and studio time</li>
<li>Paying for said studio and engineering time</li>
<li>Royalty rights for the tracks that we're recording</li>
<li>Legal fees and requirements</li>
<li>Physical production of CDs including liner notes and artwork</li>
<li>Digital distribution architecture</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>As the Swing Barons are at their core a historical preservation organization, some of our interesting and unique perks are related to preserving and sharing the amazing history of these great Kansas City bands and musicians, the dance that was done to their music, and </li>
<li>We need about $5000 dollars to begin the recording process, some of which has already been secured by bandmember contributions and other funding from the band itself, but once we get to that point the recording is on, and the rest will go into producing a bigger and better product.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Goals</h3>
<p>Our initial goal is to produce an 11 track CD, but if we can get the funding that we can stretch that goal out to produce some bonus tracks.  For each $1000 we get past $5000, we'll add an extra track to the CD up to 16 tracks at $10,000! As we approach those goals we'll ask for some input as to which tracks you might want to hear so stay tuned!</p>

<p>It's me again - <strong>Melissa Manchester</strong>.  I had such a great time partnering with you Fanchesters on my 20th studio album, <i>You Gotta Love the Life</i>, I decided to do it once more!  (Besides, you've been begging me to let you help by crowd funding another CD, whenever I see you at my concert venues!)</p>
<p><br/>This time, I'm going to make an album that's been waiting to be born for a long time - <strong><i>The Fellas</i></strong>.  In 1989, I released my <i>Tribute</i> album to honor the great women singers who meant so much to me as a young artist - singers like Ella Fitzgerald, Rosie Clooney, Judy Garland, Sarah Vaughan, Eydie Gorme ... that rarified bunch.  Ever since, I've been wanting to record another album to pay homage to the great male singers who, likewise, set the platinum standard for the rest of us - Frank Sinatra, Nat King Cole, Mel Torme, Johnny Mathis, Dean Martin ... the greats.</p>
<p><br/>I had the good fortune of recording my last CD in the state-of-the-art studios at Citrus College, a community college in Glendora, CA (about 25 miles Northeast of Los Angeles), where I am the Honorary Artist in Residence.  There, I got to see and hear the college's splendid big band, the Blue Note Orchestra, and to work with their masterful director, Dean of Visual and Performing Arts, Robert Slack.  A collaboration was formed.  The Blue Note Orchestra is my band for this new project.  It seems fitting that I help pass the torch to these dedicated young musicians as I'm paying tribute to the artists who inspired me.  An album is born!</p> <p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1491900905/xagiybfh40qdtba1bdlp.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<p>Some would think it's risky to entrust a recording project to a group of students.  I had the occasion to perform with the Blue Note Orchestra in Honolulu over two different summers.  What I found was that, under the expert tutelage of Bob Slack and Alan Waddington (and the rest of the Citrus faculty), these young musicians rose to the challenge every time, every song.  This is a community college, open to all who want to learn, and these students truly appreciate the opportunity to bloom.  I'm delighted to be of service.</p>

<p><strong>THE DAN OLIVO JAZZ BAND ALBUM</strong></p>
<p>My name is Dan Olivo. I am an Italian/American actor and jazz singer based in Los Angeles. For the last few years I have had the amazing opportunity to perform the songs I love. I have been fortunate to be able to appear with my jazz combo at various concerts, festivals, venues and private events all over Southern California.</p>
<p>Some of my most recent performances have included Bar Nineteen12 at the historic Beverly Hills Hotel, the fabulous 570 KLAC Mistletoe and Martini Christmas Concert at The Universal Amphitheatre (which also included acts like Natalie Cole, Frank Sinatra Jr., Steve Tyrell and Big Bad Voodoo Daddy), and The Eagle Rock Music Festival.</p>
<p><strong>MY DREAM</strong></p>
<p>I love The Great American Songbook which include the songs of Frank Sinatra, Nat ""King"" Cole, Dean Martin, Ella Fitzgerald, Tony Bennett, Bobby Darin, Harry Connick Jr. and Michael Bublé. These songs are timeless and it has been my lifelong dream to one day record a jazz combo album. That time is now.</p>
<p>I have teamed together with my dear friend and fabulous musician, arranger and band leader Ian Robbins and some of LA's best musicians in hopes of creating an album of some classic standards, songs of today that could have been standards, and one or two originals. I also plan to invite a special guest or two to join me in a duet.</p>
<p><strong>MY GOAL</strong></p>
<p>To raise a total of $15,000 - $25,000 split up in three Phases. Phase 1 will included the cost of writing, arranging, and obtaining the rights to record twelve songs. It will also include promotional materials such as photos, videos and marketing materials.</p>
<p>Phase 2 (The recording phase) of the album. This will include 3 days of recording and 2 days of mixing. Your contributions will help the funding of studio time, musicians, musical directors, recording and mixing engineers.</p>
<p>Phase 3 will come at a later date, will include the cost of post recording, CD production, CD cover art, cases, digital downloads, and merchandising materials (hats, t-shirts, posters, and the launch of the CD release concert).</p>
<p><strong>REALIZING THE DREAM</strong></p>
<p>By contributing to the production of The Dan Olivo Jazz Band Album you are not only helping me fulfill a lifelong dream, but you are in effect helping to keep the Great American Songbook alive. This album will be enjoyed by all who love the great standards, and will also act as the calling card for my band and me to draw in other opportunities to play the music we love.</p>
<p>Those of you who are able to contribute will be entitled to some fabulous perks including an autographed CD, digital downloads, a copy of a signed photo of the entire band as a thank you card, hats, t-shirts, your name with a thank you message on the album, and the opportunity to come to a free concert such as the album release party.</p>
<p>For those who simply cannot make a financial contribution, you can still help make this dream a reality. There is no greater marketing tool than word of mouth. Please let your friends and family know about this campaign. Let them know that there are still many of us left who love this music and want to keep it alive for this generation and those to come.</p>
<p>The Great American Songbook is simply the greatest music of all time. It is my passion and my dream to share it with the world. Please help The Dan Olivo Jazz Band achieve this goal.</p>
<p><strong>WHAT PEOPLE ARE SAYING</strong></p>
<p>When Dan began to sing, the crowd stopped what they were doing to listen. He grasped the attention of all 300 people</p>
<p>This guys a great old school crooner. He's studied the greats and you can here it in his voice.</p>
<p>Dan Olivo was born in the wrong era. He's definitely an old soul with a crooner's heart and voice. I love listening to Dan sing and have his songs playing while I'm working all the time. Do yourself a favor and get lulled back in time.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>- Thank you for checking out this page! My name is Dan Costello, but you can call me Ello. I'm a singer/songwriter from New York and I've been playing and writing music for close to 10 years now. My instruments include drums, piano, voice, bass (not well hehe) and I'm also a producer.</p>
<p>- This campaign is for an EP that I've been working on and recording for the last year or so (forgot how long at this point) and want to release within the next six months! This EP is the debut for this brand new project and has taken my vision from less than flattering demos and into the studio - I'm going all out! It means the world to me to record and release this music at the highest possible quality both musically and visually!</p>
<p>- If you want to hear a preview of two of the demos (MIDI pre-recording sessions and rough mixes) you can click this link! - <a href=""https://soundcloud.com/storymusicofficial"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://soundcloud.com/storymusicofficial</a></p>
<p>- Anyone who contributes will essentially help me pay for the recording of this record as well as the completion/finalization of the music as well as for the artwork and merchandise for this brand new project! This record has been a blast to record and the finished product will be well worth the wait! Writing and recording this thing has broken down walls for me as a songwriter, musician and producer and I hope/know that this newfound freedom will shine forth in the music. Every single contribution, big or small will get us closer to our goal and will be much appreciated!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Funding &amp; Perks</h3>
<p>- The goal I have set for the funding of this album is $2,500 - this money will go towards the following:</p>
<p>1. Album artwork/logos - $500</p>
<p>2. Physical discs - $200</p>
<p>3. T-shirts - $200</p>
<p>4. Recording/completion - $1,600</p>
<p>- The perks for helping to fund this record will include digital and physical versions of the album, T-shirts, and even a personal song written just for you! (this will be something...)</p>
<p>- If I don't end up reaching the entire goal I plan on using whatever money I have made to go ahead and pay for as much of this record as possible - every dollar counts and will help to create a successful record!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>- This project means the world to me - when I was younger, progressive bands such as Yes, Genesis, Rush and others expanded my mind and helped me find a deeper sense of self. Later, artists like Tears For Fears, Ben Folds and Imogen Heap made their way into my listening and shifted everything I had previously understood about what music could be. Japanese anime and video game music also had its place in my musical mind and its role in shaping my style as a composer and songwriter. With the risk of sounding cheesy, I owe the world to this music for how much it inspired me and ultimately healed me from a young age, and ever since this musical awakening my goal has been to give what I've received - to fill the world with music that inspires and heals.</p>
<p>- I've been feeling for the last few years that the music has been on a steady incline - I went from an excited 14 year old writing ""Dance Dance Revolution"" style electronic music on GarageBand to being in and out of few bands in High School, but ultimately it all came down to writing and singing from my heart. When I was in my first year of College, I went through my first ever (and only since) writer's block and could only write poetry. Eventually after months of silence, a new expression burst through me and called itself ""onevoice"" - the beginning of this combination of Prog and Singer/Songwriter. onevoice went on to release a few albums that were discussed on Prog forums and ended up on a blog or two thanks to the amazing people who connected with the music enough to share and believe in it. And so, after many years of writing music, Story was born as the next stage of this expression. No more MIDI or demos! I'm taking this music to the studio and making records this way from now on! To get this music to sound and looks as good as possible is my goal.</p>
<p>- Any proceeds at all for this record will truly make a difference and help a broke, just-graduated College kid like me fund the music of my dreams and push forward towards Story's unfolding..... uhm..... story..... yeah.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Stuff</h3>
<p>- Some of the challenges along the way have been working with everyone's schedules while booking rehearsals, recording dates, etc. Another has been funding - I'm the only person paying for this project so its been difficult to say the least coming up with the money to pay everyone involved, which has brought me here. I work as a piano teacher and also a producer, but I've got plenty of other things in life that require money. The way through the first challenge was just to push through and make it all work, and so far everything has been successful. The funding challenge is what brought me here to Indiegogo to ask you guys for help - every dollar is seriously so appreciated!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways to Help</h3>
<p>- If you cannot contribute financially that's ok! I won't hate you (for long). Other ways you guys can help out include:</p>
<p>1. Spreading the word! Telling as many people as possible about this thing - maybe sharing the music with friends/family and seeing if others dig it enough to contribute!</p>
<p>2. Indiegogo share tools! They include links to share on Facebook, Twitter - sharing on social media would be awesome too and get the word out to more people.</p>
<p>Well, that's it! Thanks again so much to anyone who gives anything! You guys really are helping so much! I promise this record will be worth the wait and an incredible journey for you as a listener! It came from so much time, passion and daydreaming in class and holds as much me as it possibly could! I'm just so excited to share it with the world!</p>

<h3>Who Am I?</h3>
<p>My name is CJ Cooper and I'm a 20 year old singer/songwriter from Guelph, Canada. I have been playing guitar, piano and singing for over 13 years. I have performed at the Rogers Cup, promoted my first album ""Look Ahead"" on the VIARail train across Canada, sang for CFL and CEBL games, been a part of Canadian Music Week and numerous festivals, weddings and charity events. </p>
<p>The last few years have included some of my best and worst moments in life and my music has reflected that.  As I've grown, so have my lyrics and style and I want to express it with the world in hopes that my messages can help just one person. This album has been such a collaboration with several talented and kind individuals. My mantra through this process has been ""community"".</p>
<p>This is where you come in! During Covid-19, I saw community in a way I'd never witnessed before and people came together to support others in an unprecedented way. I released a song/video during that time to give hope and give people the opportunity to be in the video and help with the process and that's what I hope to achieve with this album. I want to include you, your family, your friends. We truly are in this life together and I want my music and my audience to reflect and show that. </p>

<h3>What's This About?</h3>
<p>Welcome, everybody! I'm Alex Brubaker, and I am incredibly excited to introduce you to my latest musical endeavor, <strong><i>Building Harmonic Castles</i></strong>.</p>
<p><i><strong>Building Harmonic Castles</strong> </i>is an album I've worked tirelessly on over the last few years, recorded by the brilliant Alex Anderson at Tree of Life Studios. The album brings together my two musical personas: one as a fingerstyle guitarist who plays delicate music in intimate listening rooms and fancy places, and the other as a solo post-rock-esque act playing alongside grunge bands and experimental-noise acts. While these listener bases may not overlap much, I hope the album will stretch everyone beyond their sonic comfort zones to find something new and beautiful.</p>
<p>This is a two part album, split right down the middle to be optimized like your favorite old records.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""><strong>Side A</strong> is just me and guitar; more for the purists. It's a beautiful showcase of melody and really lets the guitar breathe. The first single I released back in February, <a href=""https://open.spotify.com/album/3fgrMdMlRH69Kh6N9ON9go"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">First Dance</a>, really embodies that.</p>
<div style=""text-align: center;""><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/FETQBQCvGOA?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""><strong>Side B</strong> explores some of my influences in post-rock and ambient music. It's still very much solo fingerstyle guitar, but combined with effects, looping, and even some audio samples.</p>
<div style=""text-align: center;""><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/XLv15Jsm_Ew?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div>

</div><div>
<h3>What's In It For Me? What's In It For You?</h3>
<p>Recording, mixing, and mastering has been complete for a few months, so I'm looking to partner with you to get this across the finish line! That means not only digital platforms, but also physical CDs and, for the first time ever, vinyl records!</p>
<p>To meet these goals, I set up some fun and exciting perks for those who contribute!</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Have you ever wanted to have me play for you in your living room (even with Joe, the violinist I often play with who is not on this album)? Have you ever wanted to sit down and pick my brain about guitar, writing, recording, or anything else? Or do you want to be one of the first to hear the album?</p>
<p>You can not only pick up a CD or record, but you can also do any of the above!</p>
<p>I set the goal of the campaign at $2000 to set realistic expectations mindful of the financial challenges many are facing with the pandemic. In reality, the costs will be a good bit more and I am prepared to absorb much of those costs so you won't have to worry about the album not being released.</p>
<p><strong>Cost estimates:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Album Art: $500-1000</li>
<li>Marketing: $500</li>
<li>Physical CDs: $1000-2000</li>
<li>Vinyl: $4000</li>
</ul>
</div><div><h3> </h3></div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges:</h3>
<p>As I mentioned, the album has already been recorded, mixed, and mastered, so the biggest hurdle is out of the way.</p>
<p>The biggest unknown is Covid-19. While I don't have answers for every scenario, I've tried to answer some of that in the FAQ section. The gist of all of that is that I don't anticipate that anything will prevent the record from happening, maybe just a delay in manufacturing and having to delay fulfillment of any in-person perks (e.g., house concerts, release party). I will certainly keep you all updated with any developments.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help:</h3>
<p>Given the economic challenges of the pandemic, I completely understand if you are not able to contribute monetarily at this time. But that doesn't mean that you can't play an important role in this!</p>
<p>Social media has a huge influence in the reach of crowdfunding campaigns. If you are not already following me on these platforms, please do so! Every like and share of this campaign will help to get me close to this goal!</p>

The biggest unknown is Covid-19. While I don't have answers for every scenario, I've tried to answer some of that in the FAQ section. The gist of all of that is that I don't anticipate that anything will prevent the record from happening, maybe just a delay in manufacturing and having to delay fulfillment of any in-person perks (e.g., house concerts, release party). I will certainly keep you all updated with any developments.
 

Other Ways You Can Help:
Given the economic challenges of the pandemic, I completely understand if you are not able to contribute monetarily at this time. But that doesn't mean that you can't play an important role in this!

Thank You!
I've now been doing this whole music thing for over a decade. I've performed across much of the eastern half of the United States for countless individuals. I've performed alongside many of my musical heroes and have made tons of relationships with musicians and music enthusiasts alike.
And that has all been possible because of people like you. Thank you so much for your continued support!",0.0,2,"1 Campaign

<h3>What is this campaign about?</h3>
<p>Hello friends and thank you for taking the time to look at our project.</p>
<p>We are offering our Debut <strong>CD Album “The Well-Tempered Guitars” </strong>as a pre-order here on Indiegogo. You'll have a chance to order it, get signed copies, and get other rewards before the CD's official release in 2021. </p>
<p>We are very passionate about recording our Debut Album entirely dedicated to the Preludes and Fugues of <strong>Mario Castelnuovo-Tedesco </strong>whose music is really close to our hearts. We are honoured to release a CD with the original works for two guitars, written by this Hollywood composer who fell in love with the classical guitar.  He humbly considered himself a “ghost-writer” since he remained in the shadows of his famous students such as John Williams and Henry Mancini. During the 1930s, Castelnuovo-Tedesco was negatively affected by the Mussolini’s government’s racial laws restricting the rights of Italian Jews. In 1939 he had to leave Italy and emigrate to the U.S. This is another reason why we think the music of Castelnuovo-Tedesco <strong>deserves to be more widely known and listened to</strong>.</p>
<p>This Album is the result of<strong> years of practice, research </strong>and many of our <strong>sacrifices</strong>. Now is the time to give it all back to the world by recording ""The Well-Tempered Guitars"".</p>
<p>Join our CD project and help us make the world sound better!</p>

<p>We are<strong> <a href=""http://www.monoguitarduo.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">MoNo Guitar Duo</a></strong>: Polish-Italian duo made up of guitarists <strong>Giuseppe Molino</strong> and  <strong>Anna Nowicka</strong> based in Rome, Italy. The MoNo is not only the acronym of our surnames, but along with the word Duo it encapsulates our idea of creating music together, where two musicians reach a common understanding and make one and unique interpretation of the composer's work.</p>
<p>In 2010 we started to play together and our main goal has always been to deepen and expand musical repertoire for<strong> <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1yTK9iXbQ4"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">2 guitars</a></strong> (and <strong><a href=""https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=2606663472907072"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">4 hands guitar</a></strong>) with our own arrangements and interpretations. </p>
<p>Over last three years we have been multi-awarded in many international music competitions and have performed in numerous Classical Guitar and Musical Festivals in Italy and abroad. On the top of constant musical research we are very involved in musical education, by giving masterclasses and seminars focusing on the most important aspects of the musician's training and growth. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>What Your € Pays For</h3>
<p>These days, streaming platforms give you access to a huge catalog of music almost for free. It's much easier and cheaper to listen to music than it had been before the streaming era, but unfortunately the costs for the production and the printing for us musicians stay the same.</p>
<p>We are still in favor of CDs, because you can hold them in your hands and touch them, you can have an autograph or a personal message on them.</p>
<p>(For those who favor the digital version, there will be the digital  download opportunity as well.)</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We both believe that Classical Music enriches you and makes you feel part of something larger than yourself. </p>
<p><strong>Your contribution</strong> to our project will make a difference in the spirit of Classical Music by supporting a duo that you know and esteem. </p>
<p><strong>Supporting an artist is supporting an entire society</strong>, because music unites us, improves and sensitises each of us.</p>
<p>Music makes people <strong>think ""out of the box""</strong>. In these tough times we need so much to think differently and to see the problems of the Covid-19 crisis from new perspectives and to be able to find creative solutions. ​We are convinced that Music can help us through this crisis and become an<strong> important source of strength and healing</strong>. </p>

<h3>About: project, vision, basic details</h3>
<p>Hi, I’m Jennifer -- thanks for stopping by my page. I’m a singer-songwriter who has spent my whole life in music. For me, music has always been about sharing passion, relating to others, creating new expression, and touching lives. </p>
<p>While I’ve had experience with studio recordings in the past, this will be my very first solo project that showcases all original music. I’d like to invite you to partner with me in making this happen.</p>
<h3>The project &amp; vision</h3>
<p>Over the last 6 months, I wrote a brand new batch of original tunes inspired by impacting experiences including my upbringing, love and connection, and of course heartbreak -- the usual. The sounds and melodies that fill the poetry come from recent raw inspiration and a strong melodic background in faith-based music, country, and folk rock. With the world turned upside down right now and more time than ever for self-reflection, I’ve had the pleasure of finding meaningful new expressions.</p>
<p>With this recent creative inspiration, I felt the message and music needed to be shared with others, which led to a few performances for a small audience, covid style. After receiving positive feedback, I’m expanding my reach by investing in a professionally produced EP featuring 3 songs so they can be heard in the homes and car radios of people everywhere. Each with their own message and unique expression, these songs deserve the opportunity to be heard and enjoyed at their highest potential.</p>
<p>With lyrics that speak of holding onto hope, the pain and process of finding freedom, and reminiscing about young love, I know many will find themselves in the sounds and message of this fresh music. And, I hope it will be an enjoyable daily life kind of accompaniment especially as we’ve faced the hardest of seasons globally. </p>
<p><strong><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5quCHJrCMT8kznqf9bm-OQ"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><i>(I’ve included a few clips from live acoustic performances here - have a listen)</i></a></strong></p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>About me</h3>
<p>Music is my home. I’m a singer at my core, and a writer with a passion to carve out relatable and beautiful descriptions that give a voice to all the different kinds of experiences life offers us. I’ve always hoped that others could find their own unique story in my music, and thankfully I’ve had the opportunity to perform in many different venues since I was a young teenager.</p>
<h3>Basic details</h3>
<ul>
<li>I will be singing all the songs </li>
<li>For production I will collaborate with a producer from Soho Sonic Studios in London. Production includes arrangement, recording, instrumentation, mixing / mastering.</li>
<li>This campaign will cover the cost of 3 songs</li>
<li>This project will result in a digitally released EP</li>
<li>The production will require me to travel to London for approximately 10 days to record in the studio </li>
<li><p>Portions of the production will be conducted remotely when possible</p></li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<h3>What is the need &amp; what does it cover</h3>
<p><strong>My campaign goal: $12,000 for the studio production and digital release of 3 songs</strong></p>
<ul><li>The total cost covers the following: <ul>
<li>Producer</li>
<li>Studio time</li>
<li>Accompanying musicians</li>
<li>Travel (to London and transportation)</li>
<li>Digital distribution</li>
<li>Production begins January 2021 with an anticipated EP release by the end of Summer 2021</li>
</ul>
</li></ul>
<p><strong>If I don't reach my full goal...</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>I will produce as many songs as possible with the amount of money raised. If I am not able to raise the minimum amount for 1 song, I will put the money aside, and conduct a future campaign to ensure the money is used for the music.</li>
<li><p><strong>No matter what, the money will go toward song production; it just may not be on the same timeline as originally projected if there are not yet sufficient funds. </strong></p></li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The reality is I’m kicking off this campaign during a very tense time in the world due to Covid and all the related difficulties. I don’t take this lightly. This presents a unique set of challenges beyond the usual. However, there are some practical solutions to manage the risks and challenges to help secure our success. </p>
<p><strong>A few key challenges:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Overall financial strain during challenging economic times leading to potential difficulty raising funds</li>
<li>Travel limitations because of covid that could affect my ability to record in London according to the timeline</li>
<li>I am a mother and work full-time. Time constraints are always a challenge when working on creative projects. </li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Methods for managing challenges:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>I will ensure my network is broad and diverse and focused not only on social media, but also email distribution to my own contacts and the contacts of others who are close to the project. I also have the ability to produce fewer songs if the full goal is not reached, which provides flexibility if indeed.</li>
<li>As of now, it is possible to travel to London and back to Israel by complying with specific requirements. I will monitor the situation far in advance leading up to scheduled travel to make necessary changes and arrangements if needed.</li>
<li>I have a support system in place to help with my children when I travel and I will use vacation days from work for both studio time and travel.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Thank you so much for taking an interest in my project. Another super valuable way you can help is by spreading the word. Here are easy ways you can do that:</p>
<ul>

</div></div>","About: project, vision, basic details
Hi, I’m Jennifer -- thanks for stopping by my page. I’m a singer-songwriter who has spent my whole life in music. For me, music has always been about sharing passion, relating to others, creating new expression, and touching lives. 
While I’ve had experience with studio recordings in the past, this will be my very first solo project that showcases all original music. I’d like to invite you to partner with me in making this happen.
The project & vision
Over the last 6 months, I wrote a brand new batch of original tunes inspired by impacting experiences including my upbringing, love and connection, and of course heartbreak -- the usual. The sounds and melodies that fill the poetry come from recent raw inspiration and a strong melodic background in faith-based music, country, and folk rock. With the world turned upside down right now and more time than ever for self-reflection, I’ve had the pleasure of finding meaningful new expressions.
With this recent creative inspiration, I felt the message and music needed to be shared with others, which led to a few performances for a small audience, covid style. After receiving positive feedback, I’m expanding my reach by investing in a professionally produced EP featuring 3 songs so they can be heard in the homes and car radios of people everywhere. Each with their own message and unique expression, these songs deserve the opportunity to be heard and enjoyed at their highest potential.
With lyrics that speak of holding onto hope, the pain and process of finding freedom, and reminiscing about young love, I know many will find themselves in the sounds and message of this fresh music. And, I hope it will be an enjoyable daily life kind of accompaniment especially as we’ve faced the hardest of seasons globally. 
(I’ve included a few clips from live acoustic performances here - have a listen)
 

About me
Music is my home. I’m a singer at my core, and a writer with a passion to carve out relatable and beautiful descriptions that give a voice to all the different kinds of experiences life offers us. I’ve always hoped that others could find their own unique story in my music, and thankfully I’ve had the opportunity to perform in many different venues since I was a young teenager.
Basic details

I will be singing all the songs 
For production I will collaborate with a producer from Soho Sonic Studios in London. Production includes arrangement, recording, instrumentation, mixing / mastering.
This campaign will cover the cost of 3 songs
This project will result in a digitally released EP
The production will require me to travel to London for approximately 10 days to record in the studio 
Portions of the production will be conducted remotely when possible

 
What is the need & what does it cover
My campaign goal: $12,000 for the studio production and digital release of 3 songs
The total cost covers the following: 
Producer
Studio time
Accompanying musicians
Travel (to London and transportation)
Digital distribution
Production begins January 2021 with an anticipated EP release by the end of Summer 2021


If I don't reach my full goal...

I will produce as many songs as possible with the amount of money raised. If I am not able to raise the minimum amount for 1 song, I will put the money aside, and conduct a future campaign to ensure the money is used for the music.
No matter what, the money will go toward song production; it just may not be on the same timeline as originally projected if there are not yet sufficient funds. 

 

Risks & Challenges
The reality is I’m kicking off this campaign during a very tense time in the world due to Covid and all the related difficulties. I don’t take this lightly. This presents a unique set of challenges beyond the usual. However, there are some practical solutions to manage the risks and challenges to help secure our success. 
A few key challenges:

Overall financial strain during challenging economic times leading to potential difficulty raising funds
Travel limitations because of covid that could affect my ability to record in London according to the timeline
I am a mother and work full-time. Time constraints are always a challenge when working on creative projects. 

 
Methods for managing challenges:

I will ensure my network is broad and diverse and focused not only on social media, but also email distribution to my own contacts and the contacts of others who are close to the project. I also have the ability to produce fewer songs if the full goal is not reached, which provides flexibility if indeed.
As of now, it is possible to travel to London and back to Israel by complying with specific requirements. I will monitor the situation far in advance leading up to scheduled travel to make necessary changes and arrangements if needed.
I have a support system in place to help with my children when I travel and I will use vacation days from work for both studio time and travel.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Our goal is to revive the music of Estatic Fear, a symphonic doom metal legend, with a 2 CD tribute album made by devoted bands and one-man-bands representing 15+ world countries.</p>
<p>Over 75% of the tracks are already recorded by late 2019. Every track that Estatic Fear ever released will be covered</p>
<p>Project supported by: international Estatic Fear fan community <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/pg/EstaticFear/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.facebook.com/pg/EstaticFear/</a> and <a href=""http://Doom-metal.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://Doom-metal.com</a></p>
<p>Project approved by: Matthias Kogler and the original Estatic Fear's lineup and CCP Records</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We started this campaign to cover the expenses of</p>
<p>A. professional mastering of the resulting material (23 tracks) by a sound engineer well experienced in symphonic doom metal mastering, estimated 800 USD</p>
<p>B. professional CD arts and booklet design, estimated 200 USD</p>
<p>C. paid target promotion of the album among symphonic doom fans over the Internet (Facebook, YouTube, VKontakte) over 3 months, estimated 100 USD<br/> </p>
<p>What you'll get is a professionally recorded and mastered double CD tribute to Estatic Fear. Our key principle is ""made by symphonic doom metal fans for symphonic doom metal fans"". Maximum musical quality and in-genre diversity ensured. To be released both on the Web and as physical CD copies.<br/><br/>Note: the donators will <strong>not</strong> receive physical copies of the tribute CDs, we can only provide you <strong>digital tracks</strong> after the release.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Estatic Fear's two albums, only released in Austria two decades ago, plus some limited numbers released in Russia and South Korea, started a cult among symphonic doom metal fans globally.</p>
<p>Our mission is to breath a second life into this music, by reaching as many Estatic Fear and symphonic doom metal fans with this tribute as the original albums did over the decades, as physical copies or licensed digital copies, mp3s from torrents, or YouTube uploads.</p>
<p>Musicians from the following countries are featured on the tribute:<br/>Serbia/Italy, South Korea, Canada, Iran, Norway, France, Argentina and Chile, Israel, Russia, USA, Ukraine, Mexico, Dominicana, Vietnam, North Macedonia, Turkey, United Kingdom, Morocco, Germany</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>We addressed possible release risks by meeting the original albums' composer and all Estatic Fear original lineup members as well as CCP Records head Claus Prellinger (Estatic Fear's producer, copyright owner) and successfully obtaining the required covers release permissions from them.</p>
<p>We have found 6 wonderful doom metal labels (in Russia, Canada, China, UK) who are willing to release and distribute the resulting album  to any part of the world.</p>
<p>We want the resulting double CD album to spread far and wide via all available channels. For the sake of this immortal music and the truly global Estatic Fear fan community.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Please help us to spread the news about this campaign and the tribute project: translate the news into your language and make posts in your countries doom metal and symphonic metal communities - on Facebook, Badoo, VKontakte, YouTube, metal forums, portals and blogs, etc.</p>

<h3>We are starting a new, non-traditional music school in Olympia Washington!</h3>
<p>-----------------------------------</p>
<p>Sound Studios Olympia is a non-profit school for private music instruction and public performance in all types of music.  Our vision focuses on creating the perfect environment for instructors and in turn, by attracting the best instructors, the best opportunities for our students.</p>
<p>How we are doing this:</p>
<p>Comfortable, safe teaching spaces for students and teachers.</p>
<p>Inspiring concert space,  for our students and instructors as well as other members of the community and touring artists.</p>
<p>Community advertising for  events.</p>
<p>Flat rate for instructors to rent studio space</p>
<p>Free use of the recital hall for teachers who work with us</p>
<p>Scheduling and billing assistance for teachers.</p>
<p>Study after study does show the benefits of music for growing children, and adults. Music teachers and small studios can bring this kind of benefit, here we are creating a teaching space which will also build the community - we learn music to share it.  We want a space where an instructor is given the opportunity to thrive and make a decent living doing what they love: helping young musicians explore their art. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Why We Are Fundraising </h3>
<ul>
<li><p>We are raising $5000 to help get us initially started to help cover the building deposit and expenses to prepare the space for teaching. We also need pianos for our performance spaces and teaching rooms.  </p></li>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Right now our biggest risk is not finding enough instructors who would like to take advantage of this opportunity, and have a studio in Sound Studios Olympia. We have several on board but need more. Donations help alleviate that concern, but we will still need to show our colleagues the benefits of working with us. Once we are open we will have many open houses to bring instructors in and we will hold several events and recitals to show the entire community how incredible this space is!</p>

<div>Goodnight, Sunrise seamlessly blends anthemic indie pop with brooding synth rock, while the frenetic energy of the band breaks down the barriers between stage and audience.

The band's sound has evolved into a genre-bending mix ranging from Florence &amp; The Machine to Muse, with elements of classic rock and dance. They have released 1 LP (Create/Destroy/Create, 2013) and 2 split-singles (D/V 1: Deaf Ears, 2013, and D/V 2: Bridgeburner, 2014), with their 2nd full-length album Falling Awake and due for release on Sept. 30th 2016 through Rejection Records.</div>

</div></div>","Toronto's Goodnight, Sunrise goes to the UK! This October we are crossing the pond for the first time ever during our album release tour and we need your help!  Throughout September we'll be raising money to help pay for the trip, and offering some pretty sweet perks along the way.  Here's our Sept/Oct tour schedule, supporting the release of our new album Falling Awake (out Sept. 30th):



So, why are we asking for $5,000?  Touring anywhere, let alone overseas, is expensive - we've toured Canada a ton and know the tricks to do it on the cheap, but our basic expenses just to get to the UK and move from show to show will be roughly:



Flights: $2,400


Van rental: $1,500


Gas: $800


Gear rentals: $1,000


Hotels: $1,500

Visas: $300

That alone totals $7,500, and there are sure to be a lot of smaller expenses that will add up, so if we surpass our goal every dollar/pound will still be very much needed!  We'll be paying for this trip no matter what because it's a really important stepping stone in our career, and we'll sell as many t-shirts as humanly possible, but straight up - it would help a LOT if we had some financial assistance.We've got a wide range of perks to reward our supporters at various levels:




Smaller contributions will receive an advance digital copy of Falling Awake, our brand new LP being released on September 30th, and signed first pressing copies on CD are also available as well as our entire discography

Mid-range perks are more unique and personal, such as one-on-one drum lessons from Paul, a custom painting from Vanessa, or a miniature instrument sculpted by David.
You can also score a night out with the band at karaoke or an escape room!
We'll even play a house party for any high rollers in Toronto!

<p>I've been involved in the music industry since the age of 15 and it has been a journey of self discovery. I've done many projects in different styles, worked with artists such as Robbie Williams and Mark Owen, but until now it wasn't clear to me what I should be doing with my music.</p>
<p>Recent experiences and realisations have helped me find my direction. I aim to give through my music by writing songs with a deep meaning, songs with a spiritual message that will inspire, transform and help us find the love that we are all looking for.</p>

<p>I’m raising £10, 000 to shoot 2 new music videos, record a 5 track EP which will include ""Sleepy Souls"", officially release this on iTunes, Spotify etc and of course, promote them all like crazy!!</p>
<p>If you enjoyed the Sleepy Souls video and you would like to see more, please donate what you can so we can get this material out to spread more peace and love!</p>

It will also (post Brexit) be a reaffirmation of Scotland's drive to become an independent nation within the EU. As well, we're aiming to raise seed capital for a fund to support youth musical education, the Alasdair Gray Musical Scholarship Trust.</p>
<p>If we are VERY successful, we want to stage a musical event in November beneath Alasdair’s 'Weegie Sistine Chapel Ceiling', at the Oran Mor. We know we can do these things, because <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bgodd7yYdt8"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">we’ve done them before</a> (in 2014) — but we can't do them if you don't pitch in and help.</p>
<p>Songs for Scotland 2 has three components:</p>
<p><strong>First</strong>, we are creating an AMAZING compilation album of Scottish songs from all over the map: genres include Folk/Trad, Hip hop, Pop, Jazz, spoken word, Reggae and Classical, it’s all there, in 20 glorious, carefully selected tracks. Languages include Scots, Gaelic, English — even Wolof (a language of Senegal). So what’s the unifying theme? Alasdair inscribed it on the central beam spanning his ceiling mural in the Oran Mor: ‘Work as if you live in the early days of a better nation.’ </p>
<p>Leading Scottish artists and musicians who have contributed tracks and are supporting the project include Allan MacDonald and Neil Johnstone with Griogair Labruidh, Matt Seattle with Robert McFall and members of the Scottish Chamber Orchestra, Woodenbox, Stanley Odd and Loki, Emily Smith, Dean Owens, Karen Matheson, Shona Donaldson, Dick Gaughan, Kathleen MacInnes, Eddie Reid, Samba Sene and Diwan, and Brina and Kieran Murray.</p>
<p><strong>Secondly</strong>, Alasdair is supporting us, in part because he wishes to 'give forward', by helping us to set up an Alasdair Gray Musical Scholarship Trust (to be administered by<a href=""https://projects.handsupfortrad.scot/handsupfortrad/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""> Hands up for Trad</a>, a registered charity and music umbrella group). He has explicitly granted us permission to name this fund for him.</p>

<p><strong>Thirdly</strong>, we have pencilled the Oran Mor auditorium for a day in November, and want to stage a live musical event at which a first scholarship will be awarded. But to do this, we’ll need to exceed our funding target by £1500. </p>
<p>So what’s the big picture?</p>
<p>Throughout his storied career Alasdair has spoken for the idea of civic nationalism; the belief that a country (as Scotland is) should be democratically governed by the people who live in it, whatever language they speak, wherever they come from and whatever their background. Moreover, he has energetically advocated the idea that 'small nations can work well'; as examples, Norway, Denmark, Holland, New Zealand -- and soon, Scotland.</p>
<p>The album of songs we're creating will both musically express and affirm these ideas; and as well, it will demonstrate to the world our continuing determination to create a peaceable, equitable, free, democratic and independent nation here, in our Scotland.</p>
<h3><strong>Our Team</strong></h3>
<p>Our team comprises the artists who've contributed to the album, people working at Scottish record companies and agencies based in Edinburgh, Glasgow and elsewhere, and others.</p>
<p>Where do we hail from? We are from everywhere: mainly from Scotland, but also from England and Sweden, Jamaica and Canada, even from Galicia. What unites us is our love for Scottish music and culture, our admiration for Alasdair and his work, and our shared desire for Scottish independence.</p>
<p><span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'>We're working closely with Hands up for Trad, who'll be administering the <a href=""https://wordpress.com/post/songsforscotland2.wordpress.com/1633"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">youth scholarship fund</a>; and also with <a href=""http://www.thenational.scot/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">The National</a>, Scotland's only daily</span><span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'> pro-independence newspaper.

<h3><strong>Please pitch in! </strong></h3>
<p>Our programme is ambitious.</p>
<p>We're aiming to create a pan Scottish — even global — collaborative cultural event to showcase the finest in Scottish music. The first Songs for Scotland album was a musical portrait of Scotland during the 2014 indyref that is still being appreciated by music lovers around the world. This sequel compilation will also be a musical portrait, of Scotland post Brexit and in the lead up to indy ref 2.</p>
<p>We're also raising seed funding for an Alasdair Gray Musical Scholarship Trust. Let's all give forward by helping to fund the training of a new generation of brilliant Scottish musicians. It’s worth noting that we are also applying to various charitable trusts to bulk up this funding — your small contribution can help us to leverage large sums from elsewhere.</p>
<p>And finally, we want to have a musical event in November beneath the murals at the Oran Mor (Scotland’s largest public artwork) to award a first scholarship and to honour Alasdair. To us it is a given that living the dictum, ‘Work as if you live in the early days of a better nation’, must also include honouring our visionaries.</p>
<p>If you can support us financially — brilliant! Thank you. If you can’t, you can still help by spreading the word. In this day and age, a better nation is built one tweet at a time. Join us on Facebook, on Twitter and on Instagram, and use Indiegogo's share tools to help us get our message out. </p>

<h3>Who we are</h3>
<p> Dear friends, fans and music lovers! We have been in the studio working on our new album and we are reaching out for support to help complete it. Here’s your chance to pre-order our new CD and show your support!</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1476405333/yilfww9zvptbvtvrzubd.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>RagTop is the Roanoke, Virginia based signature cover acoustic duo of Jim and Renee Oliphant. We perform Folk Rock, Classic Rock, New Country, Blues and R&amp;B and classic American Standards with earthy, acoustic styling focusing on the signature riffs and melodies that make your favorite songs memorable while keeping the arrangements organic, smooth and richly expressive!<br/><br/>We have been a favorite on Regional TV in SW Virginia appearing regularly on Channel 10 NBC Roanoke, VA and WSET TV Channel 13 Lynchburg, VA and has also appeared on WJHL TV channel 11 CBS Johnson City, TN and radio programs including 96.3 FM/1370 AM Austin, TX - WUVT Virginia Tech Blacksburg, VA - WVRU Radford University, Radford, VA and BlogTalk Radio and we perform nearly 200 shows a year!<br/><br/>Here is what people are saying about RagTop:</p>
<p><br/>""RagTop is an excellent example of artists that send you back in time with their renditions of tunes we all grew up with. Always passionate with their performances and guaranteed to make you follow them.""<br/>-Art Mendoza/Accomplice Entertainment Austin, TX (partner with Grammy Award winning producer Lawrence Cohn)</p>
<p> </p>
<div style=""text-align: center;""><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/Cl4bcMBeX00?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div>
<p>This is a video clip of Renee working on the vocal overdubs for our arrangement of ""Wicked Game"". Jim has finished all of the guitar parts. We perform this song live by looping the rhythm and bass and then Jim can add more rhythm and lead riffs throughout the song.  The studio affords us the opportunity to have even more fun with Renee's vocals.  This is the raw track (no reverb, level mixing or any effects - just vocals). We can't wait for you to hear the finished song! Hope you enjoy this sample for now!</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<h3>RagTop Route 460 CD</h3>
<p>The concept of this CD is based on State Highway Route 460 in our home state - Virginia. We were driving Eastbound on Route 460 out of Roanoke, VA to a show one day and were talking about how many hours we have spent on this highway traveling to our performances over the last several years. It just seemed an appropriate tribute to name our new CD  ""Route 460"".</p>
<p>The songs we select for the CD  are the core of the concept - we have completed six songs for the project to date. Our goal is to complete at least 12 songs for the CD. The songs capture the distinct vibe of RagTop.</p>
<p>As we began to develop the cover art - keeping the concept in mind - we thought that a restored vintage 50s - early 60s gas station would be perfect. The vintage station used for our cover art is located on Williamson Rd in Roanoke, VA - with the photo shoot completed and some photo editing - the cover art was complete.</p>

<h3><strong>How You Can Help and What Your Money Will Go Towards:</strong></h3>
</div><div>
<p>We have been working in the studio and already recorded the first six songs. We also have finished the artwork for the CD. To complete this rest of this project we need to raise $3,200.00. The process of recording and creating a finished album is expensive. The costs include recording (studio time) , mixing, mastering, artwork, pressing and packaging the CDs.</p>
<p>We've put together some awesome perk packages to offer you for your contributions, such as album downloads, social media shout-outs, signed CDs and posters, RagTop t-shirts, a private house concert and a day in the studio with us! Throughout the campaign, we will also be updating contributors on the recording as it unfolds.</p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We are immensely grateful for everyone willing to help us, emotionally and financially, pursue what we love. We couldn’t realistically do any of this without the love and support from all of you. Both of us are eager to see what the following months and years hold and are excited to share it will you all. In case you forget exactly why you gave RagTop any of your hard earned money, we’ll be documenting the process start to finish. From the beginning to post-production bliss, we’ll keep y’all in the loop with plenty of pictures and videos along the way.</p>
<p>We understand that some people can’t give financially, but that doesn’t mean you can’t contribute. If you feel so inclined, please share this page with friends and family and on social media (use the Indiegogo share tools located next to the big pink ""BACK IT"" button on the top right hand side of the page to share it on your favorite social media)! Thank you so much for your contributions and interest as we embark on this journey. It’s your journey too, so stay in touch.</p>
<p>Thank you for your help and we look forward to sharing the new record with you!</p>

We perform Folk Rock, Classic Rock, New Country, Blues and R&B and classic American Standards with earthy, acoustic styling focusing on the signature riffs and melodies that make your favorite songs memorable while keeping the arrangements organic, smooth and richly expressive!We have been a favorite on Regional TV in SW Virginia appearing regularly on Channel 10 NBC Roanoke, VA and WSET TV Channel 13 Lynchburg, VA and has also appeared on WJHL TV channel 11 CBS Johnson City, TN and radio programs including 96.3 FM/1370 AM Austin, TX - WUVT Virginia Tech Blacksburg, VA - WVRU Radford University, Radford, VA and BlogTalk Radio and we perform nearly 200 shows a year!Here is what people are saying about RagTop:
""RagTop is an excellent example of artists that send you back in time with their renditions of tunes we all grew up with. Always passionate with their performances and guaranteed to make you follow them.""-Art Mendoza/Accomplice Entertainment Austin, TX (partner with Grammy Award winning producer Lawrence Cohn)
 

This is a video clip of Renee working on the vocal overdubs for our arrangement of ""Wicked Game"". Jim has finished all of the guitar parts. We perform this song live by looping the rhythm and bass and then Jim can add more rhythm and lead riffs throughout the song.  The studio affords us the opportunity to have even more fun with Renee's vocals.  This is the raw track (no reverb, level mixing or any effects - just vocals). We can't wait for you to hear the finished song! Hope you enjoy this sample for now!
 
RagTop Route 460 CD
The concept of this CD is based on State Highway Route 460 in our home state - Virginia. We were driving Eastbound on Route 460 out of Roanoke, VA to a show one day and were talking about how many hours we have spent on this highway traveling to our performances over the last several years. It just seemed an appropriate tribute to name our new CD  ""Route 460"".
The songs we select for the CD  are the core of the concept - we have completed six songs for the project to date. Our goal is to complete at least 12 songs for the CD. The songs capture the distinct vibe of RagTop.
As we began to develop the cover art - keeping the concept in mind - we thought that a restored vintage 50s - early 60s gas station would be perfect. The vintage station used for our cover art is located on Williamson Rd in Roanoke, VA - with the photo shoot completed and some photo editing - the cover art was complete.

How You Can Help and What Your Money Will Go Towards:

We have been working in the studio and already recorded the first six songs. We also have finished the artwork for the CD. To complete this rest of this project we need to raise $3,200.00. The process of recording and creating a finished album is expensive. The costs include recording (studio time) , mixing, mastering, artwork, pressing and packaging the CDs.
We've put together some awesome perk packages to offer you for your contributions, such as album downloads, social media shout-outs, signed CDs and posters, RagTop t-shirts, a private house concert and a day in the studio with us! Throughout the campaign, we will also be updating contributors on the recording as it unfolds.
 
                                         
                                             Check out the NEW RagTop tee shirts!        
                                                               
                                                              RagTop Vinyl stickers
 
You can select a ""Perk Package"" in the right-hand column or if you would rather contribute without receiving a perk, use the big pink   button at the top of the page and enter your amount!
Should we be fortunate enough to surpass our goal, we will use the additional funding for additional marketing, pressing additional CDs and promotion of the new CD.
When you give to this campaign, your funds are directly supporting the recording, mixing, mastering, CD pressing and packaging of the latest RagTop CD.
 
     

 
 
Other Ways You Can Help
We are immensely grateful for everyone willing to help us, emotionally and financially, pursue what we love. We couldn’t realistically do any of this without the love and support from all of you. Both of us are eager to see what the following months and years hold and are excited to share it will you all. In case you forget exactly why you gave RagTop any of your hard earned money, we’ll be documenting the process start to finish. From the beginning to post-production bliss, we’ll keep y’all in the loop with plenty of pictures and videos along the way.
We understand that some people can’t give financially, but that doesn’t mean you can’t contribute. If you feel so inclined, please share this page with friends and family and on social media (use the Indiegogo share tools located next to the big pink ""BACK IT"" button on the top right hand side of the page to share it on your favorite social media)! Thank you so much for your contributions and interest as we embark on this journey. It’s your journey too, so stay in touch.
Thank you for your help and we look forward to sharing the new record with you!",10.0,1,"2 Campaigns

<p>My name is Clifton Anderson. I'm a professional independent Jazz musician - trombonist, composer, producer, arranger and recording artist. As a veteran in the music industry I have performed leading my own groups and worked with some of the greatest names in the music business. I've managed a record label, merchandise company and produced 8 CD's (5 products for other artists) for the worldwide market. I have released 3 highly acclaimed CD's,under my own name, the latest voted ""One Of The Top Jazz Releases Of 2012"".  I'm here to ask for your assistance in helping me release my 4th recording.</p>
<p> <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1473619690/hemnccvhrfncjq3is7nh.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/> <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1473620281/sqfbplny6umk0kr71lig.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>This new undertaking called ""Been Down This Road Before"" is a recording project long overdue. My last CD, ""And So We Carry On"" was released in 2012 and received critical acclaim for it's performances and compositions. Before that In 2007 I released ""Decade"" and 10 years prior, in 1997 my 1st CD ""Landmarks"". The long stretch between recordings occurred because I self funded. This time I decided not to only rely on my own funds, but to ask you to help me deliver a great new recording. Without your help it could take another year or two for me to save the money, but the music is ready now, and the timing is right.</p>
<p>I've ""Been Down This Road Before"", as an independent artist with great new original music just begging to be recorded, but without the finances to make it happen. I'm frequently asked, why don't you record more often?  Well, it's become increasingly more difficult for indie artists like myself to successfully finance &amp; produce new recordings without additional financial support. That needed support comes from contributors like you &amp; that's why it's so important for me to have your support &amp; participation. I am constantly evolving my art and the new music for this project is in my opinion my best work yet. The music for ""Been Down This Road Before"" reflects an aspect of the human experience everyone can relate to. I know it will be a source of enjoyment and satisfy listeners both spiritually and intellectually for years to come. In short, this is music with substance.  In addition to those elements, I have a pool of some of the most talented and world renowned musicians that are ready to participate along with relationships with top studios, engineers, radio and publicity people. I can't wait to present ""Been Down This Road Before to my fans and to the rest of the world, so please get in on the campaign by contributing whatever you can, and look at the perks available for the different levels of contributions. Those of you that simply can't donate any funds right now can still contribute immensely by spreading the word about it and sharing the campaign with your friends on social media. You can rest assured that all of your contributions will go directly to the costs of recording, mixing, mastering, packaging and promoting the music. I'm requesting $15,000.00 but hope to exceed that amount since it will require considerably more money than that to finish the project. If for any reason I don't reach the 15K goal, whatever funds have been contributed will start me along the recording process I'm committed to finishing. When all is done I'm sure you, as a contributor will be very happy and proud to have been part of this campaign effort and distinctive recording release.</p>
<p>Best Wishes Always,</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Founded in 2015 by Festival Director, Elizabeth A. Baker; Artist-In-Residence, Robert Fleitz; and Festival Coordinator, Fofi Panagiotouros; The Florida International Toy Piano Festival is an extension of the purposes of The New Music Conflagration, Inc. Visiting festival participants engage with the local community to further the Tampa Bay area culturally, in addition to promoting the work of talented toy piano performers, scholars, and composers from across the globe. The 2017 Florida International Toy Piano Festival is proudly partnered with: The City of Pinellas Park, The St. Petersburg Library System, Bloom Art Center, The Space at 2106 Main, The Hillsborough County Library System, and MIRA at St. Petersburg College.</p>
<p>The 2017 festival has expanded into a large-scale event attracting worldwide attention and as such our roster of featured guest artists has grown. The New Music Conflagration, needs assistance in raising funds to help cover the costs of the featured guest artists but also, for small travel stipends to assist international/national festival participants, that otherwise may be unable to attend the festival due to financial hardship.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<ul>
<li>Funding from this campaign will assist with travel expenses for guest artists and small travel stipends accepted festival participants from around the world.</li>
<li>Snacks for artists, staff, interns, and student collaborators</li>
<li>In the event that we do not reach $3500 by the end of our campaign, the funds collected will still go to offset the cost of travel for guest artists.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<ul>
<li>Due to programming across both Pinellas and Hillsborough County in a variety of venue types, the festival affords all members of the community access to high quality performances and education about the toy piano.</li>
<li>The festival's outreach program affords students at Pinellas County schools experienced based learning through collaboration with professional composers and performers.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Due to assistance from local organizations and sponsors, our venue costs have been completely covered by partner organizations. At this juncture in preparation for the festival, our primary risk is not raising enough money to cover the full cost of flights for guest artists. We hope to overcome this singular challenge through donations made during this campaign, in addition to local sponsorships from area business.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>While every dollar is helpful to bringing world-class artists to the 2017 Florida International Toy Piano Festival, you can still assist our efforts by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sharing this campaign on social media as well as in emails to friends, colleagues, and family.</li>
<li><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">We also, encourage you to share this campaign with the world via word of mouth and old-fashioned press outlets!</span></li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<h3>Festival Organizational Leadership</h3>
<p><strong>Robert Fleitz (toy piano, melodica)<br/>Co-Artistic Director</strong></p>
<p>Robert Fleitz, whose playing has been called “mesmerizing” by the New York Times, is a Manhattan-based pianist and composer, committed to building community through the ambitious advocacy of new works of music. As a performer, Robert has commissioned and premiered over forty solo, chamber, and music-theater works in the past four years. He recently gave the United States premiere of Japanese composer Michio Mamiya’s Piano Concerto IV: Scenes of an Unborn Opera with the New Juilliard Ensemble, and has also performed with the Imperial Symphony Orchestra and the Tampa Bay Symphony.  </p>
<p>Recent highlights of the past few months include a concert tour in Debrecen, Hungary and Copenhagen, Denmark; residencies at the Danbury Chamber Music Intensive in Danbury, CT and the Sitka Fine Arts Camp in Sitka, AK; and This Is Not a Piano Recital, a concert of newly commissioned works for harpsichord, harmonium, celesta, toy piano, and melodica. As a composer, Robert seeks to explore the fringes of human interaction through emotionally lucid music that is tailored specifically to the performer for whom he is writing. Notable recent commissions include a theatrical toy piano duo for the Florida International Toy Piano Festival in Tampa Bay, FL; an art song for Sitka Fine Arts Camp in Sitka, Alaska; and a solo harp piece for Emily Levin, principal harpist of the Dallas Symphony.</p>
<p>Education and arts outreach are a focal point of Robert’s work. He recently accepted a teaching apprenticeship with the New York Philharmonic. His past work has included teaching musical theater to students in Sitka, Alaska, and ear training to graduate students at The Juilliard School–as well as organizing outreach trips to New Orleans, Louisiana, and Arusha, Tanzania. Robert’s own piano studies began with his father at age 4. He completed his undergraduate studies at The Juilliard School studying with Julian Martin, and is currently pursuing his master’s degree there studying with Hung-Kuan Chen. He studies composition with Simon Frisch, having previously worked with Howard Buss. Other major teachers and mentors have included Marc Durand, Ching-Wen Hsiao, and Hilary Easton. He has had masterclasses with Yoheved Kaplinsky, Jeremy Denk, and Richard Goode. In his spare time, Robert enjoys avocados, clouds, Tilda Swinton, and Pokemon, among other things.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Elizabeth A. Baker (toy piano, electronics)<br/>NMC Executive Director &amp; Festival Director</strong></p>
<p>Celebrated for her “terrifying dynamic range,” cleanliness of sound, as well as unique sensitivity and ability to sculpt her performance for the acoustics of a space, Elizabeth A. Baker is a dramatic performer with an honest, near psychic connection to music, which resounds with audiences of all ages and musical backgrounds. As a creator, her understanding of sonic space from organic intuition and studies in music production, pair with a unique eclectic voice, making for a spatial and auditory experience of music. Eschewing the collection of traditional titles that describe single elements of her body of work, Elizabeth refers to herself as a “New Renaissance Artist” that embraces a constant stream of change and rebirth in practice, which expands into a variety of media, chiefly an exploration of how the sonic world can be manipulated to personify a variety of philosophies and principles both tangible as well as intangible.</p>
<p>An active performer highly sought after for her unique concert presentation methods, which break the fourth wall and draw the audience further into the music by asking them to listen beyond the surface through interactive dialogue, reminding them that there is no such thing as an incorrect interpretation of a work. Elizabeth firmly believes that every person will encounter music in a unique manner because each person comes from a different set of cultural norms, life experiences, and even the way they physically hear can be a factor to consider when seeking to relate with a work. Her solo concert tours have featured engagements at Lamar University (Beaumont, TX), Flying Monkey Arts Collective (Huntsville, AL), Eyedrum (Atlanta, GA), Southern Methodist University (Dallas, TX), and the Good Shepherd Chapel (Seattle, WA).</p>
<p>Emmy-award winning composer Larry Groupé has referred to her works as “Perfect.” and compared one of her early works to Debussy’s Engulfed Cathedral. Elizabeth’s works have been featured by Composers Circle, FIVE by FIVE, TEDxYouthTampaBay, Tampa Mini Makers Faire, Orlando Mini Makers Faire, as well as at the 2014 Electronic Music Midwest Festival and the 19th International Festival of Women Composers. Her compositions have been studied in academic institutions throughout the United States including USC-Thornton and the University of Georgia – Athens.</p>
<p>In 2015 she received an Individual Artist Grant from the Saint Petersburg Arts Alliance and the City of Saint Petersburg, Florida to create and present an original sound installation In Our Own Words: A Sonic Memory Quilt, which told the stories of various African-Americans in a fresh avant-garde manner, framed by evolving drones and a four-hour live performance by Elizabeth.</p>
<p>In addition to her work on the concert stage and on the page writing for other performing artists, Elizabeth has extensive training in recording arts, live sound reinforcement, and consistently received praise as well as high marks for the artistic sensibility and technical excellence of her mixes at St. Petersburg College, where she studied closely under mastering engineer Dave Greenberg. Today, friends and colleagues across the globe, frequently look to her as a consultant on projects for her skills as both a recording and mix engineer.</p>
<p>Combining her love of electronics and keyboard instruments, Elizabeth embarked on a mission in 2015 to promote works for toy piano and electronics, using a setup that combines handmade microphones and hydrophones. Her original works have been hailed by the Orlando Weekly as “a sterling testimonial to her artistry that proves she’s not just an expert in the toy piano field but a pioneer.” In Fall 2015, Schoenhut Piano Company added Elizabeth A.

</div></div>","Short Summary
Founded in 2015 by Festival Director, Elizabeth A. Baker; Artist-In-Residence, Robert Fleitz; and Festival Coordinator, Fofi Panagiotouros; The Florida International Toy Piano Festival is an extension of the purposes of The New Music Conflagration, Inc. Visiting festival participants engage with the local community to further the Tampa Bay area culturally, in addition to promoting the work of talented toy piano performers, scholars, and composers from across the globe. The 2017 Florida International Toy Piano Festival is proudly partnered with: The City of Pinellas Park, The St. Petersburg Library System, Bloom Art Center, The Space at 2106 Main, The Hillsborough County Library System, and MIRA at St. Petersburg College.
The 2017 festival has expanded into a large-scale event attracting worldwide attention and as such our roster of featured guest artists has grown. The New Music Conflagration, needs assistance in raising funds to help cover the costs of the featured guest artists but also, for small travel stipends to assist international/national festival participants, that otherwise may be unable to attend the festival due to financial hardship.
 

What We Need & What You Get

Funding from this campaign will assist with travel expenses for guest artists and small travel stipends accepted festival participants from around the world.
Snacks for artists, staff, interns, and student collaborators
In the event that we do not reach $3500 by the end of our campaign, the funds collected will still go to offset the cost of travel for guest artists.

 

The Impact

Due to programming across both Pinellas and Hillsborough County in a variety of venue types, the festival affords all members of the community access to high quality performances and education about the toy piano.
The festival's outreach program affords students at Pinellas County schools experienced based learning through collaboration with professional composers and performers.

 

Risks & Challenges
Due to assistance from local organizations and sponsors, our venue costs have been completely covered by partner organizations. At this juncture in preparation for the festival, our primary risk is not raising enough money to cover the full cost of flights for guest artists. We hope to overcome this singular challenge through donations made during this campaign, in addition to local sponsorships from area business.
 

Other Ways You Can Help
While every dollar is helpful to bringing world-class artists to the 2017 Florida International Toy Piano Festival, you can still assist our efforts by:

Sharing this campaign on social media as well as in emails to friends, colleagues, and family.
We also, encourage you to share this campaign with the world via word of mouth and old-fashioned press outlets!

 
Festival Organizational Leadership
Robert Fleitz (toy piano, melodica)Co-Artistic Director
Robert Fleitz, whose playing has been called “mesmerizing” by the New York Times, is a Manhattan-based pianist and composer, committed to building community through the ambitious advocacy of new works of music. As a performer, Robert has commissioned and premiered over forty solo, chamber, and music-theater works in the past four years. He recently gave the United States premiere of Japanese composer Michio Mamiya’s Piano Concerto IV: Scenes of an Unborn Opera with the New Juilliard Ensemble, and has also performed with the Imperial Symphony Orchestra and the Tampa Bay Symphony.  
Recent highlights of the past few months include a concert tour in Debrecen, Hungary and Copenhagen, Denmark; residencies at the Danbury Chamber Music Intensive in Danbury, CT and the Sitka Fine Arts Camp in Sitka, AK; and This Is Not a Piano Recital, a concert of newly commissioned works for harpsichord, harmonium, celesta, toy piano, and melodica. As a composer, Robert seeks to explore the fringes of human interaction through emotionally lucid music that is tailored specifically to the performer for whom he is writing. Notable recent commissions include a theatrical toy piano duo for the Florida International Toy Piano Festival in Tampa Bay, FL; an art song for Sitka Fine Arts Camp in Sitka, Alaska; and a solo harp piece for Emily Levin, principal harpist of the Dallas Symphony.
Education and arts outreach are a focal point of Robert’s work. He recently accepted a teaching apprenticeship with the New York Philharmonic. His past work has included teaching musical theater to students in Sitka, Alaska, and ear training to graduate students at The Juilliard School–as well as organizing outreach trips to New Orleans, Louisiana, and Arusha, Tanzania. Robert’s own piano studies began with his father at age 4. He completed his undergraduate studies at The Juilliard School studying with Julian Martin, and is currently pursuing his master’s degree there studying with Hung-Kuan Chen. He studies composition with Simon Frisch, having previously worked with Howard Buss. Other major teachers and mentors have included Marc Durand, Ching-Wen Hsiao, and Hilary Easton. He has had masterclasses with Yoheved Kaplinsky, Jeremy Denk, and Richard Goode. In his spare time, Robert enjoys avocados, clouds, Tilda Swinton, and Pokemon, among other things.
 
Elizabeth A. Baker (toy piano, electronics)NMC Executive Director & Festival Director
Celebrated for her “terrifying dynamic range,” cleanliness of sound, as well as unique sensitivity and ability to sculpt her performance for the acoustics of a space, Elizabeth A. Baker is a dramatic performer with an honest, near psychic connection to music, which resounds with audiences of all ages and musical backgrounds. As a creator, her understanding of sonic space from organic intuition and studies in music production, pair with a unique eclectic voice, making for a spatial and auditory experience of music. Eschewing the collection of traditional titles that describe single elements of her body of work, Elizabeth refers to herself as a “New Renaissance Artist” that embraces a constant stream of change and rebirth in practice, which expands into a variety of media, chiefly an exploration of how the sonic world can be manipulated to personify a variety of philosophies and principles both tangible as well as intangible.
An active performer highly sought after for her unique concert presentation methods, which break the fourth wall and draw the audience further into the music by asking them to listen beyond the surface through interactive dialogue, reminding them that there is no such thing as an incorrect interpretation of a work. Elizabeth firmly believes that every person will encounter music in a unique manner because each person comes from a different set of cultural norms, life experiences, and even the way they physically hear can be a factor to consider when seeking to relate with a work. Her solo concert tours have featured engagements at Lamar University (Beaumont, TX), Flying Monkey Arts Collective (Huntsville, AL), Eyedrum (Atlanta, GA), Southern Methodist University (Dallas, TX), and the Good Shepherd Chapel (Seattle, WA).
Emmy-award winning composer Larry Groupé has referred to her works as “Perfect.” and compared one of her early works to Debussy’s Engulfed Cathedral. Elizabeth’s works have been featured by Composers Circle, FIVE by FIVE, TEDxYouthTampaBay, Tampa Mini Makers Faire, Orlando Mini Makers Faire, as well as at the 2014 Electronic Music Midwest Festival and the 19th International Festival of Women Composers. Her compositions have been studied in academic institutions throughout the United States including USC-Thornton and the University of Georgia – Athens.
In 2015 she received an Individual Artist Grant from the Saint Petersburg Arts Alliance and the City of Saint Petersburg, Florida to create and present an original sound installation In Our Own Words: A Sonic Memory Quilt, which told the stories of various African-Americans in a fresh avant-garde manner, framed by evolving drones and a four-hour live performance by Elizabeth.
In addition to her work on the concert stage and on the page writing for other performing artists, Elizabeth has extensive training in recording arts, live sound reinforcement, and consistently received praise as well as high marks for the artistic sensibility and technical excellence of her mixes at St. Petersburg College, where she studied closely under mastering engineer Dave Greenberg. Today, friends and colleagues across the globe, frequently look to her as a consultant on projects for her skills as both a recording and mix engineer.
Combining her love of electronics and keyboard instruments, Elizabeth embarked on a mission in 2015 to promote works for toy piano and electronics, using a setup that combines handmade microphones and hydrophones. Her original works have been hailed by the Orlando Weekly as “a sterling testimonial to her artistry that proves she’s not just an expert in the toy piano field but a pioneer.” In Fall 2015, Schoenhut Piano Company added Elizabeth A. Baker to their official artist roster.
In Summer 2016, Elizabeth embarked on creating the score for a film project headed by the brilliant dancer-choreographer Helen Hansen French, which explores the experience of being an artist-mother. The Motherhood Project workshop, presented in relation to the film featured a live dance performance with Elizabeth accompanying Helen’s choreography with toy piano, electronics, and Indian harmonium, a keyboard instrument that rarely appears on the Western musical concert stage. A sensitive improviser, with experience in a wide array of genres, Elizabeth is a frequent collaborator for Jim Ivy’s Tangled Bell Ensemble and other improvisational projects throughout Florida.
Elizabeth is author of Toyager: A Toy Piano Method, the first comprehensive instructional book for toy piano, featuring principles of technique, practice strategies, music notation, as well as improvisational tactics.
Elizabeth is Founder and Executive Director of The New Music Conflagration, Inc., a not-for-profit corporation founded in the State of Florida to promote the work of contemporary composers and musicians.

<h3>CÁNTALE A TU BEBÉ -Book &amp; Music</h3>
<p>We are <strong><a href=""http://www.cathymarcy.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Cathy Fink &amp; Marcy Marxer</a></strong>, multi-GRAMMY Award winners in Children's Music. We have spent over thirty-five years helping families connect through music.  We believe in the power of a parent's voice to let a baby know they are loved. For many years, parents told us at concerts that they didn't sing to their own children. They were afraid that they did not have a good  singing voice. <strong>YOUR BABY LOVES YOUR VOICE</strong> and we want to help every parent, grandparent, sibling and person in a new baby's circle of love feel confident singing  in SPANISH or ENGLISH using their OWN voice.</p>
<p><a href=""http://www.singtoyourbaby.net"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>SING TO YOUR BABY</strong></a>® was published in 2010 and won five national awards. Now, we are ready to publish <a href=""http://www.cantaleatubebe.net"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>CÁNTALE A TU BEBÉ</strong></a>, a full Spanish translation.

<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<p>We are raising $15,000 to cover the cost of printing a 32 page, color illustrated book. We've paid our Spanish vocalists, translator and audio mastering studio. Now we need to pay the artist and book designer, printer, publicist and marketing team. Printing is the highest of these costs. We have worked at no fee for this ongoing labor of love and WE LOVE IT! Every time a parent sends us an audio clip or photo of a special moment inspired by the project, we know we are doing important work.</p>
<p>And, we've cooked up fun ways to thank you for contributing, from a single book &amp; download to a book/CD package to donating books to a library or non-profit in your name.</p>

<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<p>As life-long singers, songwriters and musicians, we have seen the power of music in the lives of children and their parents. Having a new little one in the house is a time of joy and wonder.

<p>""You mighta had dope, guns, and riots in the streets, but your kids have smartphones and Netflix and they could not care less about your cyclops revolution. Which is a bit of a nightmare for the last true rock star, a wild-card from the streets of Detroit, Kory Clarke who made his reputation and carreer on being the baddest motherf*cker in all of Badsville with an incendiary socio-political agenda and a roar-for-war that rattles mountains.""

<p>Warrior Soul shows aren't just gigs. They are profane sermons delivered with HIGH VELOCITY and MAXIMUM VOLUME and THIS is what this New WARRIOR SOUL Album is all about!  </p>
<p>Get ready for a great Summer Record ....</p>
<p>Kory Clarke is a songwriter, musician, artist and producer.  There has been a great start to the album already,  the musicians on this record are in the writing phase in Chicago, Barcelona, Dublin and Edinburgh. Introducing John Polachek co/writing and performing on guitar as well as Adam and Nate Arling from 'The Last Vegas' , Sue Gere and Xevi Strings (Warrior Soul ""Stiff Middle Finger"" LP) alongside Christian Kimmett, Stevie Pearce, Michael Branagh and Colin Dunne ( our bro's and brilliant current Touring band) 2013 - 2017.</p>
<p>Kory Clarke is writing again and we KNOW what that means! </p>
<p>In helping Clarke achieve his new record he is offering  great rewards in return for your support.   The last few years has been getting incredible reviews and done amazing shows and Festivals.  Warrior Soul's new Live Album 'Tough As F*ck'  (released Nov. 2016) has had great reviews and is a great indication of the commitment and potential of this next project.</p>

<p>Why now? Why not?!</p>
<p>Warrior Soul / Kory Clarke receives many e-mails that say ' your music saved my life in very bad times'  and 'you're a great inspiration and don't stop rockin'  .. If that is not inspiration enough, then what is?! </p>
<p>Getting a record out for the summer would make a really strong 2017 Tour season and Warrior Soul needs to be out there, to walk forward through these trying and confusing times.<br/>The band has  emerged believing stronger than ever that music and art is needed, that great songs are needed, and Kory Clarke is committed to that work.</p>
<p>What is the album about?</p>
<p>These are songs about our journeys over the past few years and the present.  It is Rock And Roll with the truest sense of music. These are stories, they speak of drinking into the unknown and trusting what emerges out of that process amongst other socio-political topics of course. They are songs about weathering storms and transformation, about learning from the wild parties, the dark and edgy places. They are songs that support walking the road less travelled.</p>
<p>If you've enjoyed Kory Clarke/Warrior Soul's previous albums then you will more than likely enjoy this one, and, it is an extension and growth from what he's done before. The next step, if you will :)</p>
<p>It is expensive to make an album, and what what we're raising here is covering the basic costs of what it takes to produce a professional studio record and promote it well.</p>
<p>Kory Clarke wants this album to reach a much wider audience this time.  This is Warrior Soul's 9th studio record,  we don't want to have to cut corners.</p>
<p>How can you help?</p>
<p>There's a number of REALLY GOOD 'PERKS' REWARDS that come with your support of this album.<br/>We need your help to make this an amazing ad campaign and Tour it as well as other costs. All these need to be financed and keep Warrior Soul going strong.</p>
<p>We would be grateful for you sharing this campaign as much as possible with your networks over the next couple months and helping us reach our goal.</p>
<p>Just as a last note to all of you reading:</p>
<p>In order to keep Touring and have everyone who is contributing excited about this project, we need to make a really good sounding record. The money from labels has been dwindling for a long time to make good sounding records and promotion for these. After so many critically acclaimed studio records on major labels we think this type of funding is the way forward for us at this time. </p>

<p>*The album is planned  to be released in June 2017. This is the intention, we will release it as soon as it's ready! If you have bought perks that can be delivered before that date then you can request to have them sooner, otherwise they will all be sent together when it's launched.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Founded in 2012, Nöyze counts four members:</p>
<p>Adrien Harvey - Lead vocals and guitar, Alexis Danetz - Lead guitar, Mat Roots - Drums, Chester - Bass. The band’s initial influences include groups such as Pink Floyd, Kings of Leon, the Beatles, etc. With these influences as a starting point, Nöyze has created a sound which is very much its own.<br/><br/>Their first EP was released in 2014. The same year, Nöyze was officially sponsored by Sennheiser. Nöyze released their second album, From Here On Out, in August 2015. It is available at HMV as well as on Itunes, Spotify, Deezer, google play, Amazon music, etc.</p>
<p>Since 2012, Nöyze has performed hundreds of shows across Quebec and eastern Canada. Nöyze also performed several times in Ontario, in Germany (Taubertal open air festival), as well as in Mexico City, in 2012 and 2013, as part of the Faro De Oriente festival sponsored by the Mexican Ministry of Culture. In 2017, the band also toured Europe extensively, playing in over 20 cities and 6 countries. </p>
<p>Nöyze released their 3rd studio album in January of 2018. </p>

Founded in 2012, Nöyze counts four members:
Adrien Harvey - Lead vocals and guitar, Alexis Danetz - Lead guitar, Mat Roots - Drums, Chester - Bass. The band’s initial influences include groups such as Pink Floyd, Kings of Leon, the Beatles, etc. With these influences as a starting point, Nöyze has created a sound which is very much its own.Their first EP was released in 2014. The same year, Nöyze was officially sponsored by Sennheiser. Nöyze released their second album, From Here On Out, in August 2015. It is available at HMV as well as on Itunes, Spotify, Deezer, google play, Amazon music, etc.
Since 2012, Nöyze has performed hundreds of shows across Quebec and eastern Canada. Nöyze also performed several times in Ontario, in Germany (Taubertal open air festival), as well as in Mexico City, in 2012 and 2013, as part of the Faro De Oriente festival sponsored by the Mexican Ministry of Culture. In 2017, the band also toured Europe extensively, playing in over 20 cities and 6 countries. 
Nöyze released their 3rd studio album in January of 2018.

<p>I'm teaming up with a crew of visionaries and founders who long to see this project unfold in bold and creative ways.

<h3>a formal bio.</h3>
<p>Profound Beauty is often found in the tension. Through song and poetry, Daje makes it her mission to seek it out and expose it. As a performer, she pulls cues from favorites, Billie Holiday, Corinne Bailey Rae, serpentwithfeet, and Valerie June, permeating rooms with a vulnerable fusion of poetic rock and soulful ballad.</p>
<p>From an early age, Daje's father, an award-winning percussionist and Nashville-based Grammy-nominated producer, exposed her to the nuts and bolts of blues, rock n' roll, and gospel in the backstages of Memphis listening rooms and Beale Street bars. She comes from a long lineage of songwriters, poets, and cultural workers who used their lives to give back artistically. She joyfully carries this lineage into every listening room.</p>

After nearly 15 years, Lazarus is heading back into the studio to record a new worship album called “Prepare the Way!”. “Prepare the Way!” will be a collection of some of our all-time favorite Worship songs. We are recording the album with Producer Brian Coombes at Rocking Horse Studios, one of New Hampshire’s best-recording studios, featured multiple times on Chronical as well as having a song receiving two ""Best Song"" nominations from the Independent Music Awards for “Everywhere is Home,” feathering London’s Sing Gospel choir.
Recording an album isn’t as easy as setting up a microphone and hitting record. There is Preproduction, studio time, paid recording engineers, Copyright Licensing, Mastering, and Manufacturing; all of which add up fast!
We've got 19 days to raise funds, so don't delay, watch the video above and find out all about it!

What We Need & What You Get

Through exclusive project updates and pre-orders of the album, we're hoping to raise additional funds to help with the recording, production and distribution costs.
We're excited to provide a great selection of thank you gifts:

<h3>...the fun to begin!</h3>
<p>I'm Chloe Hennessee and I’m a 17-year-old singer-songwriter from New York City. I have been writing songs from the moment I started playing the guitar and ukulele at the age of 7.          Music has always been my passion, and the new songs I will be recording for this project are deeply personal to me and, in my opinion, are my best yet. I can't wait to share them with you! </p>
<p>Back in 2017,<strong> I won the NYC Teen Songwriting Competition sponsored by <i>Guitar Mash</i> and the NYC Mayor's Office of Media and Entertainment. </strong>Since that moment, my musical journey has taken off! I won or placed in other song writing contests and performed at major events with well-established musicians such as <strong>Justin Guarini, Fernandito Ferrer, Victoria Vox, Monica Rizzio, Gregory Harrington, and Mark Stewart (Paul Simon).</strong> In addition, <strong>I became one of the youngest artists to be sponsored by both <i>Martin Guitars</i> and <i>Ohana</i> <i>Ukuleles</i>. </strong></p>

<p>Through all of this excitement, I have continued to write. The songs on my last album,<strong>""Ups &amp; Downs,""</strong> are quite different from my more recent ones. While ""Ups &amp; Downs"" employs fairly standard rock band instrumentation (i.e., guitar, bass, drums, keys), I hear something different for my new album. I have already spent several hours with my dad and producer/sound technician, Wayne Silver of <i><strong>The Ice Plant</strong></i> studio, exploring all the crazy sounds and beats in my head (and finding new ones!) and we are making great progress! </p>

<p>I have also chosen to do something different with the release of this album. Rather than record, mix, master, etc. the entire album and release it all at once at some later date, I have decided to do what's called <strong>""Drip Content.""</strong> <strong>What this means is I'll release one single per month from February through September.</strong> That way, you'll start hearing my new songs sooner, rather than later. Think of it as viewing a really cool series on Netflix the way it was meant to be viewed rather than binge watching it! That being said, when all the songs are completed, they will live in a collection that will be ""the album."" </p>
<p><strong>As I'm sure you are aware, making an album is expensive. The money goes so many places. Listed below are just some:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Recording studio time and song production</strong></li>
<li><strong>Hiring musicians...rehearsing and recording</strong></li>
<li><strong>Mixing</strong></li>
<li><strong>Mastering</strong></li>
<li><strong>Artwork for each single (that will ultimately make up the album cover)</strong></li>
<li><strong>Aggregation of music (CD Baby for distribution to Spotify, iTunes, etc.). </strong></li>
<li><strong>Promotion of each single upon release - to hopefully get my songs on playlists, TV shows, etc. Basically heard by all the right people!</strong></li>
<li><strong>And more!</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>We have crunched the numbers and think we can manage the cost if we are able to raise<strong> 10K</strong> from crowdfunding to supplement. That's where you come in! </p>
</div><div>
<p>This is my second favorite part (after making music of course). <strong>PERKS! </strong>I have been looking at different perks for my supporters and have some really cool ideas. We're doing<strong> stickers, t-shirts (and crop-tops!)</strong> for a start. In addition, I will be doing a <strong>limited number of signed artwork &amp; photos from the single releases.</strong> <strong><i>Ohana Ukuleles</i> has also generously offered to provide 3 ukulele packages - autographed by yours truly.</strong> <strong>You can also</strong> <strong>book me for a house concert </strong>and I will perform all the songs from the album and more (New York City area only...unless you're going to fly me and my dad to your location :) </p>

<h2>Hello Dear People!</h2>
<p><strong>I am raising funds to record the songs that I have written over the last 8 years,</strong> and really give them their full treatment of upright bass, cello, percussion, piano, harmonies, and more. We will be recording at home, but need your help to cover our costs.</p>
<p>For a sample of what we did before, listen below. I learned a lot through this process, and this time we will mix and master professionally. </p>
<p> <a href=""https://galenhefferman.bandcamp.com/releases"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://galenhefferman.bandcamp.com/releases</a> <br/><br/>Thank you to Jahnavi Veronica for filming this entire video and for your relentless patience with my camera avoidance. <br/><br/>Here is Jahnavi's Music:</p>
<p><a href=""https://jahnaviveronicamusic.bandcamp.com/releases"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://jahnaviveronicamusic.bandcamp.com/releases</a></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>I write songs that both come from and hopefully, bring people into the dreamworld.</strong> I write songs from starry skies, from stone halls in dreams, from grief and pain, from relief, from all that is living and <i>for</i> all that is living. I write songs to inspire people to serve the living earth and live to their greatest and deepest purpose. I write songs because they start to pour out of me anyway if I don't. </p>
<p><strong>In the Spring of 2018,</strong> after a long bout of strange and seemingly unfortunate events, I had a totaled car and tendonitis in my left hand, which left me unable to work or play stringed instruments. This led me into a deep process of asking questions about what I really came here to do, and by the end of the summer, I had experienced a number of visions detailing to me what I was to be doing:</p>
<p><strong>I was to tour down the West Coast alone</strong>, with no recognition or recorded work, playing shows at little venues in, as it turned out, places that were dear to me as I was growing up, and building altars to the living earth, to remind people that we all come from vibrant living, singing, breathing history and cultures.<br/><br/><strong>With friends and family's help</strong>, I gathered enough funds to have a little place to sleep on the road, and a couple things to make videos in nature, and some extra funds to pay for gas and expenses. The entire tour sent me through a process of growing up and reflecting on how important it is to share what you have deeply inside you. It kicked off a summer of travel that lasted from April until October, and led Jahnavi Veronica (who joined me along the way) and I to share our music at venues and festivals from Washington, to Arizona, from Oregon Country Fair, to studying Persian Radif in New Mexico.  In September we had a short break between travels, and recorded two little EPs at home in three days.<br/> </p>
<p><strong>By the time October came around</strong>, we landed back in Portland, immediately had to move to a new place, and planned a Winter Solstice Ritual Concert that involved some 20 people, all centered around a beautiful mandala of living plants, meant to focalize and call in energy for life to come. </p>
<p><strong>Here's the poster </strong>for that show by Jahnavi and I. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1580358982/wuu2hfagwdqciq1kkjuv.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

<p>So here I am, asking for some help to record this album. <strong>I know better than ever how to create something on a shoestring budget, but I need support to get closer to the sound that I hear in my head.</strong></p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We will record this album of 11-15 songs at my family's home in Portland, (the rooms sound fantastic, wood floors and high ceilings and all) so there will be no studio rental. <br/><br/><strong>Here's the Breakdown of our Costs: </strong><br/><br/><strong>$3,000</strong>: Paying Alisdair Lee (an awesome local sound engineer) for mixing and mastering 15 songs. He charges $200 per song. (It takes him all day to mix and master one song)</p>
<p><strong>$150: </strong>Coaching sessions with Alisdair on proper mic placement and recording techniques. (Some already completed, will need one more while we are recording)</p>
<p><b>$2,180-$3,350: </b>Paying all the musicians and one engineer, (excluding myself, I am not asking to be compensated for my time) $60-$100/day for their time.<br/><br/><strong>$700-$1250:</strong> New Microphone: AT4050 or Soundelux U195<br/>I am already funded to purchase a Focusrite Clarett 4pre, an ART two channel Preamp with tube replacements, and an ART Tube Compressor with tube replacements, so I just need help with another microphone! These things are all an investment into future recordings of myself, friends and family, and others. <br/><br/><b>$1,500: </b>Printing Costs for 1,000 CDs and a lyric book with artwork and stories.  </p>
<p><strong>$150: </strong>Album art photography and design. We are doing most of it ourselves, but may need to hire a friend to help us with some rope assisted tree climbing. (I'll leave it at that at the moment.)</p>
<p><strong>$30: </strong>Costs for putting the Album on all the relevant platforms (spotify, itunes, etc) through CD Baby. </p>
<p><strong>$200: </strong>Extra Costs towards my rent while I am not able to do other work. As I said, I am not raising funds to be paid for my time, so this is the only personal cost I am including.</p>
<p><strong>$800-$1000: </strong>Indiegogo Platform fees and processing fees. (about 10%) <br/>This is standard for all platforms like this.</p>
<p><b>$200-$450: </b>Since this platform counts shipping costs towards my amount raised, I am adding estimated shipping costs onto my goal, $200-$500, although I am not sure how much this will cost, as it is impossible to calculate who will purchase what. If shipping costs are less than this, I will add this amount raised to paying others up to the $100/day mark, or adding more on to Alisdair's payment. </p>
<p><strong><u>Total Costs:</u></strong> </p>
<p><strong>$8,910-$11,080</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<h3>A note on shipping outside of the U.S:</h3>
<p>If you live outside of the United States, shipping packages to you is highly variable in cost. </p>
<p>I cannot include these costs in my goal without raising the goal radically, so if you want to buy a physical item and you live outside of the USA, please contact me directly!</p>
<p><strong>Also: <i>If you live in Portland, Oregon or nearby</i>, I would very much prefer to meet with you in person to give you your perks! This radically reduces the cost of shipping things to you, which is expensive for people without larger companies.</strong><br/> </p>
<h3>Stretch Goals </h3>
<p>At <strong>$13,780, </strong>$2,700 past our $11,080 maximum goal, we will be able to do a run of Vinyl! (200 Copies) I will add this as another perk for those of you that want it. </p>
<p><strong>If we are able to raise our minimum goal of $8,910, we will be able to record, mix, master, and print CDs and album artwork, and get them out to y'all, and pay those playing on the album, with no stress. <br/>At $11,080, we will be able to pay everyone playing $100/day, and get a higher quality mic to record with. </strong></p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Why I chose flexible funding (and Risks)</h3>
<p><strong>This album is happening no matter what.</strong> I will not risk an all or nothing format, because I know that we will be able to fulfill the perks and get CDs to you all no matter what. I am in conversation with the people I am working with about this, and whatever we are able to raise, we will work with. We are used to doing everything DIY, so that would be nothing new. </p>
<p><strong>If we don't reach our goal, here is what could happen: </strong></p>
<p>-We could have to print the CDs/books ourselves to fulfill the perks. (We've done it before)</p>
<p>-The release of the album could be delayed, by as much as a month. </p>
<p>-We could have to pay Alisdair a lower price than his asking price (We will do our very best to keep this from happening)</p>
<p>-Artists could be paid at the minimum of what I am asking. (This however is first priority for me)</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<p>Jahnavi and I were able to record our two little eps in the living room in a week, with a budget of about two hundred dollars, so imagine what we could do if we actually had the funds available to record, mix, and master properly!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>If we are able to get this project off the ground, we will be able to put out something that is able to stand alongside more ""professional"" artists that are out there, and you will have a recording of music that has literally kept me alive at points to accompany you through your life, in moments of deepest grief and in ecstatic joy as well. </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you love this music and are excited for it to get out there, but you are, like so many of us, just getting by on what you have, no worries, I understand! </p>
<p><strong>I would love it if you could:</strong></p>
<p>-Share this fundraiser with your friends who might be interested by personal message, or in person! </p>
<p>-Tell your friends about my music! </p>
<p>-Share this campaign with your friends on social media with whatever kind words you can muster. </p>

<h3>I carry so much gratitude in my heart,</h3>
<p>to those of you that asked to hear my music in the beginning of this journey, learned and played my songs, participated as fellow musician or audience member, given me tips for where to play, told people about my music, given me inroads to festivals, contributed to my Patreon or helped me start up touring last year, to all those that love and care for me, and to all of you doing your best to be a beacon of kindness in this strange world.</p>
<p>I know that if I were not encouraged, cared for, and loved, and if it were not for music, I may not be alive today. I owe more gratitude than I could possibly articulate to all of my teachers, human and plant and animal and inter-dimensional being alike, and to this spinning stone with magma heart and green skin where we all live.</p>
<p>Whatever you can do to help with this project and in my greater journeys is more than enough, and I pledge to pay forward all that I can in the form of giving my deepest gifts that I have every opportunity I am given. </p>
<p>I could not thank you all enough, and if I were to try, this would be the longest section of this whole dang thing.</p>
<p>And maybe that would be for the best.</p>

$800-$1000: Indiegogo Platform fees and processing fees. (about 10%) This is standard for all platforms like this.
$200-$450: Since this platform counts shipping costs towards my amount raised, I am adding estimated shipping costs onto my goal, $200-$500, although I am not sure how much this will cost, as it is impossible to calculate who will purchase what. If shipping costs are less than this, I will add this amount raised to paying others up to the $100/day mark, or adding more on to Alisdair's payment. 
Total Costs: 
$8,910-$11,080
 
A note on shipping outside of the U.S:
If you live outside of the United States, shipping packages to you is highly variable in cost. 
I cannot include these costs in my goal without raising the goal radically, so if you want to buy a physical item and you live outside of the USA, please contact me directly!
Also: If you live in Portland, Oregon or nearby, I would very much prefer to meet with you in person to give you your perks! This radically reduces the cost of shipping things to you, which is expensive for people without larger companies. 
Stretch Goals 
At $13,780, $2,700 past our $11,080 maximum goal, we will be able to do a run of Vinyl! (200 Copies) I will add this as another perk for those of you that want it. 
If we are able to raise our minimum goal of $8,910, we will be able to record, mix, master, and print CDs and album artwork, and get them out to y'all, and pay those playing on the album, with no stress. At $11,080, we will be able to pay everyone playing $100/day, and get a higher quality mic to record with. 
 
Why I chose flexible funding (and Risks)
This album is happening no matter what. I will not risk an all or nothing format, because I know that we will be able to fulfill the perks and get CDs to you all no matter what. I am in conversation with the people I am working with about this, and whatever we are able to raise, we will work with. We are used to doing everything DIY, so that would be nothing new. 
If we don't reach our goal, here is what could happen: 
-We could have to print the CDs/books ourselves to fulfill the perks. (We've done it before)
-The release of the album could be delayed, by as much as a month. 
-We could have to pay Alisdair a lower price than his asking price (We will do our very best to keep this from happening)
-Artists could be paid at the minimum of what I am asking. (This however is first priority for me)
 

Jahnavi and I were able to record our two little eps in the living room in a week, with a budget of about two hundred dollars, so imagine what we could do if we actually had the funds available to record, mix, and master properly!
 
If we are able to get this project off the ground, we will be able to put out something that is able to stand alongside more ""professional"" artists that are out there, and you will have a recording of music that has literally kept me alive at points to accompany you through your life, in moments of deepest grief and in ecstatic joy as well. 
 

Other Ways You Can Help
If you love this music and are excited for it to get out there, but you are, like so many of us, just getting by on what you have, no worries, I understand! 
I would love it if you could:
-Share this fundraiser with your friends who might be interested by personal message, or in person! 
-Tell your friends about my music! 
-Share this campaign with your friends on social media with whatever kind words you can muster.

I carry so much gratitude in my heart,
to those of you that asked to hear my music in the beginning of this journey, learned and played my songs, participated as fellow musician or audience member, given me tips for where to play, told people about my music, given me inroads to festivals, contributed to my Patreon or helped me start up touring last year, to all those that love and care for me, and to all of you doing your best to be a beacon of kindness in this strange world.
I know that if I were not encouraged, cared for, and loved, and if it were not for music, I may not be alive today. I owe more gratitude than I could possibly articulate to all of my teachers, human and plant and animal and inter-dimensional being alike, and to this spinning stone with magma heart and green skin where we all live.
Whatever you can do to help with this project and in my greater journeys is more than enough, and I pledge to pay forward all that I can in the form of giving my deepest gifts that I have every opportunity I am given. 
I could not thank you all enough, and if I were to try, this would be the longest section of this whole dang thing.
And maybe that would be for the best.
With love and care,

<h3>THE EMERSON THEATER</h3>
<p>The historic Emerson Theater was opened was back in 1928. If you have visited the room recently, you can see that this age is really starting to show, and the room is in need desperate need of new life. </p>
<p>It has become a legendary room in this area, and I would like to see it restored to its former glory. If I can raise the proper funds, I can attract the right people to bring in the type of talent we used to see come through the Emerson over the years, and much more. </p>
<p>I believe that if the room was much improved, it could be easily re-opened and become a very enjoyable space for a huge variety of people, both here in Indy and for many miles around. If the room was remodeled nicely, there were more guest accommodations for attendees, sound and lights were good, I could eat and maybe get a drink, I could park my car safely, and I could see a show that I am interested in for a reasonable ticket price; now THAT is an ideal situation that I would like to see in our city.  And that is exactly what I would like to make happen. </p>

<h3>WHAT WE WANT TO DO</h3>
<p>Here are the improvements we would like to make: </p>
<ul>
<li>Restore front signage to original condition</li>
<li>Expansion of theater and into neighboring spaces. More space &amp; increased capacity will give us the ability to get bigger talent in the room, and do more things with the facility</li>
<li>Integration of kitchen, restaurant-area, and full service food menu</li>
<li>Expansion from beer/wine only to full alcohol menu </li>
<li>General remodel of entire interior &amp; exterior. New walls, fresh paint, new fixtures, etc. </li>
<li>Improved utilities; electric, plumbing, HVAC</li>
<li>Remodeled bathrooms, mens bathroom floor flattened</li>
<li>Addition of nearby parking lot, patrolled by off-duty police to increase neighborhood safety</li>
<li>General clean up and revitalization of outdoor area, sidewalks, perimeter of building and surrounding areas</li>
