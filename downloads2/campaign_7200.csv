<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p dir=""ltr"">Moviehouse’s The Circle Bridge is a new site-specific video performance that combines live choreography of Mayuna Shimizu's Blue Muse Dance and large-scale animated projections of Nathan Punwar to tell a story of interconnectivity, travel and history. Audience members follow their own distinct narrative as they walk the span of the 2810 foot Pulaski Bridge that connects Greenpoint, Brooklyn with Long Island City, Queens across the Newtown Creek. Along their walk they encounter four separate projections and two unique performances that each tell a distinct part of their tale. Each element is integrally designed to give each viewer a unique all-encompassing visual, audio and physical experience.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The Circle Bridge is structured by six overlapping stories that are grounded in the history of the bridge, the neighborhoods that surround it and the communities that live and work there. The audience meets six distinct characters and they traverse time and space in interconnected  loops. Projected photographs morph into large animations on warehouses then come to life as dancers on the bridge itself. The Circle Bridge takes place over six weekend nights in September 2013.</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>To bring this piece to life, we need your help. The Circle Bridge is our most ambitious project to date. We are combining our creative experiences in dance, video and public art to create a massive and impactful piece. We need to raise $4,000 to rent the 4 10,000 lumen projectors required to transform warehouse walls into animated stories. Work of this scale is impossible without the extremely bright projectors. If we exceed our goals we will be able to add more shows.</p>
<p>As thanks we're giving you exclusive access to The Circle Bridge through preview content, signed show posters, free access to rehearsal, conversations and even historical tours with the directors, designers and performers. </p>

<p>I am interested in the innovative, yet humble process of Jerry-rigging. When I was 11, I locked myself in my room with my Walkman
headphones and a piece of chewing gum. Not to sulk, although that would be a
fair guess. The left speaker was out, and I took the whole thing apart and
discovered that the wires were not making a good connection. I was accustomed
to this kind of problem solving, growing up in a family of bohemian mechanical
engineers. After twisting the wires together, I took a tiny piece of the
chewing gum and coated the wires, keeping them somewhat held together. This patch worked for a good hour before
it started crackling again, but I felt proud of my first Jerry-rig. </p>
<p>The process of taking something apart, reevaluating each individual
component, and putting it all back is how I approach making installations.<span>  My sculptures and installations are
made of familiar, gently used materials. I use forms to play with the balance

<h3>
<i>Yangdaora</i> Art Therapy Project for Children from Fukushima</h3>
<ul>
<li>The <i>Yangdaora</i> Project is about offering a residential art therapy retreat for Fukushima's children in Singapore, working in partnership with The Red Pencil Foundation. Based in Singapore, this humanitarian charity provides Art Therapy for children who are experiencing overwhelming situations, worldwide. <br/>
</li>
<br/><li>
<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Evacuation from the contaminated land is essential for those children to lead a healthy life, but many families are struggling to do so due to a lack of financial and emotional resources. </span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Our long-term goal is to provide this retreat to as many Fukushima children as possible. We are determined to do so by involving the community in Fukushima and supporters around the world, throughout the project. By doing so, we can help connect Fukushima with the world and raise global awareness of this devastating situation. It is our hope that this will also help them to get enough support for relocation to a safe environment, before its too late. <br/><br/></span>

The Yangdaora Project is about offering a residential art therapy retreat for Fukushima's children in Singapore, working in partnership with The Red Pencil Foundation. Based in Singapore, this humanitarian charity provides Art Therapy for children who are experiencing overwhelming situations, worldwide. 


Evacuation from the contaminated land is essential for those children to lead a healthy life, but many families are struggling to do so due to a lack of financial and emotional resources. Our long-term goal is to provide this retreat to as many Fukushima children as possible. We are determined to do so by involving the community in Fukushima and supporters around the world, throughout the project. By doing so, we can help connect Fukushima with the world and raise global awareness of this devastating situation. It is our hope that this will also help them to get enough support for relocation to a safe environment, before its too late.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Jamaica Osorio, and I am a world-renowned poet and activist from Honolulu, Hawaii. Upon graduating from Stanford University this July, I will be attempting to attend the Masters in Arts and Politics program at New York University, where I will start and complete a manuscript devoted to Hawaiian stories. My campaign is designed to get me to New York, where I will be able to continue developing as an artist.</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I have decided that if I can raise half of the money I need to pay for my dream-program at NYU, I will attend in the fall. Without your donations, I will not be able to afford tuition, and will not be able to continue my work on the mainland.</p>
<p>All of the perks offered as rewards for your contributions are exclusive; featuring hand-written notes, brand-new poems, and revised edditions of old chapbooks. </p>
<p>If I don't reach my full goal, Donors will have the option of recinding their sponsorship and the remaining funds will go towards paying off the student-loans I've already accumulated, and towards paying for tuition at the University of Hawai'i</p>
</div>
<p> </p>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>I understand that some people just can’t contribute, but there are other ways to help out. Please take the time to spread the word about this project to family and friends. Sharing on Facebook and Twitter is greatly appreciated, and an awesome way to show your support!</p>

<h2><strong>More Information</strong></h2>
<p>Aloha My name is Jamaica Heolimeleikalani Osorio</p>

<p>Some of you know me as the grown up version of a 3 year old terror running and dancing throughout your church services</p>
<p>And maybe more of you know me as the internationally recognized poet/performer</p>
<p>I am coming to you today to invite you to be a part of a movement that will allow me to grow and transform from those things to become a masters student and future graduate from the Tisch School of the Arts and NYU. This past Winter I was accepted to Tisch based not only on my academic record and artistic excellence at Stanford University, but because of my commitment to engaging in dialogue and transformative artistic projects. Supporting this campaign will not only award you several artistic pieces and opportunities it will also enable me to study at  the program of my dreams in the one year Art Politics Masters program at Tisch .</p>
<p>The full cost of my program and expenses hovers around 70 K. Initially I wrote off the program and opportunity because of the steep cost and the unreasonable financial burden it would create. Recently, however, I have decided that if I find enough money to cover tuition (44K) I will follow my dreams and find a way to make it. I have applied to almost every scholarship I could find and am waiting to be notified. I was offered a 10K award with the invitation to Tisch. Any amount that you could share will help me make it the rest of the way. Even better, send this link and opportunity along to your friends to make your impact reach even further; it could make a huge difference.</p>
<p>In addition to supporting a young rising artist and academic donating to this campaign will provide you as the donor tangible benefits as well. Before I get into the specifics of what you will be funding and what benefits are being offered I would like to personally thank you for taking the time to even consider giving to this cause. It means the world to me.</p>
<p>In order to make this endeavor worth your while I have decided to compound two of my greatest interests into one project: Furthering myself as an artist scholar and exposing the power of Hawaiian literature. I have spent the last year researching and writing an honors thesis focused on the way a specific moÊ»olelo<a href=""#_ftn1"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" title="""">[1]</a>, HiÊ»iakaikapoliopele, was informative of a very specific female identity before missionary contact. Additionally the thesis examined the relationship between two female lovers and friends, HiÊ»iaka and HÅpoe, and the way their relationship seems to have been erased from the native and national consciousness. It is through that work that I have become increasingly interested in developing a manuscript of poems and stories written either through the voice of the two lovers or in honor of their story. Finally this art project will culminate in the publishing of the manuscript and the development of the script into a theatrical piece, likely a one or two woman show.</p>
<p>Depending on the amount of your contribution you could receive anything from my revised poetry chapbooks, new (previously unpublished) chapbooks, pieces of my upcoming manuscript, VIP tickets to a benefit concert<span style=""text-decoration: line-through;"">s</span> featuring myself, my father and other artists. The largest donations will afford the sponsor a voucher for free performances/concerts nearly anywhere in the world.  To learn more about these benefits scowl down and take a look at the panel on your right. In addition to these gifts you will gain the good fortune of supporting the dream of a young capable artist and academic in her search to expand her horizons and share Hawai’i’s story across the globe.</p>
<p>I am  deeply passionate about this project and the Tisch program because I believe it is the best way to strengthen the identity of my people by  returning to our traditional stories as representation of our tremendous strength, intelligence and creativity. So much of who we are has been lost in the way we have been turned away from our history and stories. I want to be a leader in a growing movement of artist/scholars who use traditional work and art to inspire their own contemporary art and activism.</p>
<p>I applied to Tisch’s Masters in Arts Politics program at NYU to provide myself a venue in which to create and collaborate with artists of different disciplines and to share this traditional story with artists and activists from around the world. Supporting this journey will allow me to attend Tisch and will support my work as I attempt to broaden my scholarly and artistic horizons. Additionally it is my most humble belief that supporting this artistic endeavor is also sustaining the long history of kanaka maoli (native Hawaiian) artists and scholars and will have a tremendous impact on the way we teach our children to preserve and value our stories in the future.</p>

 Saves People is the mission of creating art to express yourself without
 judgement or censorship and to find beauty in the complexities of the 
human condition and how we experience the world around us.  We all have a
 different story - Accept who you are and accept others.  We suffer when
 we don't accept things and when we can't relate to others.</p><p>We 
want to create art that can teach, relate, empower, move and free 
people.  This is where ""Art Saves People"" comes from.  Without darkness,
 there can be no distinction of light.  Exposing and observing artwork 
that encompasses emotion or experience can help others to empathize and 
enter a world that can be humbling.  It can help people to celebrate and
 explore different subcultures and lifestyles, and to gain depth and 
appreciation for one another.</p><p>Art can make you feel alive when 
you're feeling robotic by helping to reveal your feelings, desires, 
repulsions and your overall human condition.  </p><p>""Screaming my 
story, releasing emotions, healing my pain and escaping into a world 
where I am validated and free is a way in which I have chosen to live. 
 The most exceptional way to respect myself and honor this life is to 
create art.  Art saved my life.  Everyday, Art Saves People."" - Lauren

What does that mean exactly? It means that we've bought a van and are traveling to different art shows and helping with different art projects across the country all of August! We already have shows lined up in Philadelphia, PA and Orange County, CA with more in the works!  What is Art Saves People?Igniting the senses by capturing the essence of our human condition""Art
 Saves People"" was originally an idea that Lauren created her art by. 
 It has since become a network of creative individuals that have a 
common connection of art touching their lives in one form or another.Art
 Saves People is the mission of creating art to express yourself without
 judgement or censorship and to find beauty in the complexities of the 
human condition and how we experience the world around us.  We all have a
 different story - Accept who you are and accept others.  We suffer when
 we don't accept things and when we can't relate to others.We 
want to create art that can teach, relate, empower, move and free 
people.  This is where ""Art Saves People"" comes from.  Without darkness,
 there can be no distinction of light.  Exposing and observing artwork 
that encompasses emotion or experience can help others to empathize and 
enter a world that can be humbling.  It can help people to celebrate and
 explore different subcultures and lifestyles, and to gain depth and 
appreciation for one another.Art can make you feel alive when 
you're feeling robotic by helping to reveal your feelings, desires, 
repulsions and your overall human condition.  ""Screaming my 
story, releasing emotions, healing my pain and escaping into a world 
where I am validated and free is a way in which I have chosen to live. 
 The most exceptional way to respect myself and honor this life is to 
create art.  Art saved my life.  Everyday, Art Saves People."" - Lauren

<p>FUNDING BREAKDOWN</p>
<p><b>Gallery Hire:</b></p>
<p>I need £1800 for a 2 week hire of a prime gallery space in east
London. The venue is part of a close-knit network of galleries, easily
accessible, in an area of high footfall. This means PRETTY has the chance to be
seen by a lot of people and that the show can really make a difference in
shaping people’s views on what it means to be pretty.</p>
<p><b>Framing:</b></p>
<p>With each artwork comprising of mixed media I have been in
negotiations with framers and for £700 I could get strong, decorative frames
for each piece, along with high quality UV protective glass so that none of the

<p><b>Marketing:</b></p>
<p>£2,500 will fund an advertising campaign on the London
Underground, giving the show maximum exposure, as well as the printing of promotional
material such as flyers, posters and large-scale banners for both the art
exhibition and the performance night.</p>
<p><b>Transport:</b></p>
<p>I estimate I’ll need £115 for safe transportation of all 14 of
the art works to and from the gallery space.</p>
<p><b>Fees:</b></p>
<p>I’ll need another £385 for a 4% fee payable to indiegogo for
letting me use their platform as well as a third party 3% fee for Paypal.</p>
<p>So all together the amount I need to raise comes to £5,500.   </p>
<br/><p>Since

<p>i recognize the sacred power in live performances; in that they have the potential to invite others into a world they may have not experienced before. ONION + BANANA JUICE is a journey through the 7 main energy centres [chakras] that you will experience through the performance of live music, live overhead projections, illustrations, colours, costumes, movements, textures and unspoken energetic languages. it's important to me that i acknowledge all the support i have around me in sharing space, creation + abundance with those i have chosen to work with leading up to this event because i recognize that such an experience involves much more than myself. your contributions will be supporting the importance in compensating 20+ artists who are involved and allow us to create this experience into it's full potential. </p>

<p>financial abundance is something that has not always come easy for me to receive, to give. but it's something that i want to learn how to have a good relationship with. simply asking for the help of friends who are willing to put their time, talents and support into me and my visions is something that was hard to do at first because i felt i didn't have the money to have them involved. i have to be honest and let you know that these artists are more than willing to do this work just to simply support me. i want these same artists to know that i appreciate them as we can share our abundance together in spending time and working with each other. skipping out on compensation for artists is not something that i am willing to allow. too many curators drive their visions before paying respects to the artists involved in their plans. i recognize that i need to authentically give what i'd like to receive for my self- im wanting to end the idea that artists don't need to get paid. finding this abundance is not easy. the work is not easy. but i'm learning where i am powerful in doing the work, where i am already supported and where i need support. </p>

</div></div>","i recognize the sacred power in live performances; in that they have the potential to invite others into a world they may have not experienced before. ONION + BANANA JUICE is a journey through the 7 main energy centres [chakras] that you will experience through the performance of live music, live overhead projections, illustrations, colours, costumes, movements, textures and unspoken energetic languages. it's important to me that i acknowledge all the support i have around me in sharing space, creation + abundance with those i have chosen to work with leading up to this event because i recognize that such an experience involves much more than myself. your contributions will be supporting the importance in compensating 20+ artists who are involved and allow us to create this experience into it's full potential.

""cry- when you hold in your tears, you drown your heart, when you cry, you water the earth"" - [elder Willie Nolan comforting a sister] one thing i've learned the most in the creation of 7 is how important my tears were. my tears showed me how passionate, hurt and full of love i am and when i didn't allow myself to cry, i allowed myself to forget. water is healing. i honour all of the cry babies to cry, baby. made from the ramie plant, indigenous to Eastern Asia are these heart shaped leaves turned into the strongest natural fibre. does not rot or mold and is stronger when wet. hand embroidered ""cry, baby"" to remind you it's encouraged to feel what you feel and cry.

<p>     <b><i>When The Birds Fly Hom</i></b><b>e</b> là một dự án nhiếp ảnh kể chuyện với mục đích
tìm hiểu về cuộc sống của các du học sinh Việt Nam sau khi về nước sinh sống và làm việc.
Dự án bao gồm một <b>triển lãm ảnh</b> và
một <b>buổi toạ đàm</b> nhằm trả lời những
câu hỏi mà mỗi du học sinh Việt Nam, hay sinh viên quốc tế từ bất cứ nơi nào
trên thế giới, đều trăn trở: Ở hay về? Nếu trở về, chúng ta sẽ thuộc về đâu?
Tái hoà nhập khó khăn như thế nào? Liệu cái giá phải trả có xứng đáng hay
không?</p>
<p>     <b>Triển lãm </b>sẽ trưng bày 35 bức ảnh và câu
chuyện của 35 nhân vật là du học sinh đã về nước, đóng vai trò là một bức tranh
toàn cảnh về chủ đề này. Còn <b>buổi
toạ đàm </b>sẽ khai thác sâu hơn câu
chuyện của 5 vị diễn giả là cựu du học sinh có tên tuổi trong nước để truyền cảm
hứng cho những thế hệ sau. Sau khi triển lãm kết thúc, các bức ảnh và câu chuyện
được thu thập trong suốt dự án sẽ được đăng tải trên trang Facebook chính thức
của dự án để chạm được đến nhiều người hơn.</p>

<p>1. Hiểu thêm về cuộc sống của những du học sinh trở về, gồm tất cả những niềm vui, nỗi buồn, khó khăn và định kiến trong quá trình tái hoà nhập.</p>
<p>2. Nhận được một thông điệp rằng mỗi người có một câu chuyện khác nhau, vì thế thay vì phán xét và rập khuôn nhau, chúng ta hãy học cách nhìn nhận mỗi người bằng một cái đầu cởi mở và một góc nhìn công bằng hơn.</p><p></p>

Tái hoà nhập khó khăn như thế nào? Liệu cái giá phải trả có xứng đáng hay
không?
     Triển lãm sẽ trưng bày 35 bức ảnh và câu
chuyện của 35 nhân vật là du học sinh đã về nước, đóng vai trò là một bức tranh
toàn cảnh về chủ đề này. Còn buổi
toạ đàm sẽ khai thác sâu hơn câu
chuyện của 5 vị diễn giả là cựu du học sinh có tên tuổi trong nước để truyền cảm
hứng cho những thế hệ sau. Sau khi triển lãm kết thúc, các bức ảnh và câu chuyện
được thu thập trong suốt dự án sẽ được đăng tải trên trang Facebook chính thức
của dự án để chạm được đến nhiều người hơn.
Mục đích
     Bằng cách khai thác và tập hợp những câu chuyện
của các du học sinh hiện tại đã về nước sinh sống và làm việc, When
The
Birds Fly Home mong muốn đưa ra một góc nhìn chân thật và đa chiều xung
quanh chủ đề này với hi vọng qua các câu chuyện, người tham dự sẽ:
1. Hiểu thêm về cuộc sống của những du học sinh trở về, gồm tất cả những niềm vui, nỗi buồn, khó khăn và định kiến trong quá trình tái hoà nhập.
2. Nhận được một thông điệp rằng mỗi người có một câu chuyện khác nhau, vì thế thay vì phán xét và rập khuôn nhau, chúng ta hãy học cách nhìn nhận mỗi người bằng một cái đầu cởi mở và một góc nhìn công bằng hơn.

<div>Imagine 8,000 watts of deep, permeating bass, moving through the entire body like a cosmic wave of sacred acoustics.

<div>Deep vibrations start off slow, and gradually increase in frequency as they move through the body, right through the internal structures we perceive to be solid. </div>

All efforts will be made to black out the outside world and allow the user to go to a more infantile, earthed state. </div>

<div>The Black Rock Bass Chair will be made with 8 subwoofers and 2 amplifiers to pound out massive amounts of deep bass. The frame is built out of strong wood and rope to hold participants as they lay just a few inches above the subwoofers. Bass will blast through the body, while participants lay on the rope. A controller will be changing the frequency.</div>

I never have seen this kind of thing before or since a few years ago and I have been very excited to gift it to Burning Man ever since.

Repair
This campaign's goal of $10,000 focuses on the nitty-gritty: the work needed

Every $100 that is donated pays for the repair of one of the crane's 110 tons!

Structural Inspection  $3,500. Already underway, the report from this inspection will give us the specific steps needed for the continued preservation of the crane.

Guano Removal  $2,500. Pigeons have found their way into the cab, depositing years of guano inside. After cleaning, the cab of the crane will be closed to prevent further nesting.

Maintenance and Repairs  $4,000. We anticipate making repairs where time and weather have taken their toll, as with any outdoor object. The cab will be sealed to prevent future interior damage.
Total  $10,000.While these amounts
are, in some instances, estimates, the work is very real. In fact, we have

How will we show our thanks?
We have created some great perks, only available to our Indiegogo donors. Here are a few highlights:
$50 Donation - Tweet of Appreciation from @BMIatWork and your name added to our online Wall of Fame at www.thebmi.org AND a handwritten Thank You signed by BMI staff AND a print of the crane from our Archives, matted to fit an 8 by 10 inch frame (limited to just 200 reproductions).
$500 Donation - Tweet of Appreciation from @BMIatWork and your name added to our online Wall of Fame at www.thebmi.org AND an invitation for two to our Renovation Reception (date and time TBA) AND an invitation for two to a museum tour focused on your chosen gallery and led by one of our Senior Educators (date and time TBA).

<p><b>Short Summary</b></p>
<p>Coming June 5 - June 7, 2015 is the first
annual Shasta Yoga Fest in Mount Shasta, California. Produced by the Shasta
Yoga Institute and Shasta Yoga Fest founder Amy Cooper, this campaign to raise awareness and funds is
motivated by a passion to increase economic vibrancy and cultural diversity to our local
community as well as to unite yogis and those interested in the yogic and
expressive arts, to come to Mount Shasta for an integrated, expansive learning
experience. <br/></p>
<p>Through its annual festival, the Shasta Yoga
Fest will bridge communities and join together devotional artists, yoga
teachers, audiences and scholars from around the nation to share meaningful experiences,
engage conversations, open personal boundaries and enjoy the pure beauty of
Mount Shasta through artistic and spiritual discovery and renewal.</p>
<p>Nationally known artists, musicians, and yoga
instructors will be participating from   Los Angeles, San Fransisco Bay Area, Arcata up to Seattle, as well as from Pennsylvania and Chicago; all bringing their honed skills and passions to this weekend
event. <br/></p>
<p>This festival will also promote opportunities for less-known teachers and artists to be exposed to a larger audience and receive recognition and support for their potential.<br/></p>

<p><strong>ABOUT LESLI PATROCK MAKEUP ARTISTRY</strong></p>
<p>Lesli Patrock is a freelance makeup artist based out of Worcester/Boston Ma. I have been doing make up for over three years and specialize in a wide variety of make up styles. I don't think I have a favorite style of makeup but I tend to learn towards the crazy out of the box looks, although I do enjoy classic glamour looks as well! I feel as though I get a lot of my inspiration through color and the people I surround myself with. I hope to touch people's lives and to make them feel good about themselves with and without makeup. People always say, ""Do what makes you happy!"" and being a makeup artist definitely makes me happy. I hope to make a full time career out of it some day! I thank you so much for supporting our campaign any way you can and we look forward in showing you what we are capable of in our future Endeavors! Peace, love and lipstick!<span id=""yui_3_7_2_1_1370305101173_14595"" style=""font-family: Noteworthy; font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold; line-height: 24px;""></span></p>
<p><strong>ABOUT TIME OBSCURED PHOTOGRAPHY</strong></p>
<p>Time Obscured Photography is the work of Manda Rose, an artist based in Worcester / Boston, MA. Through my photography I have been able to connect with unique humans and create something that I am passionate about and speaks to others. My images tend to explore the subtle qualities of human emotion and an idea of beauty that is not quite perfect- beautiful, yet quirky, often dark and a bit mysterious. I don’t simply aim to snap a picture of a person, but to take the subject to a level that is slightly more mystical. By spending time creating the initial look with each subject and then taking that raw image into the digital editing phase, I am able to meld the inspiration I get from my subject’s unique personality with my own personal expression. My goal is to network and work with other passionate people (makeup artists, stylists, designers and models), showcase my photos and evolve as an artist. Thanks for supporting my art and our campaign!</p>

<h2>Joan of Art</h2>
<p>Joan of Art are Suki and Thea Wilkins. We are illustrators, artists, art event organisers. We practise all different art mediums but they all benefit from our love of sketching. We love exploring the forests and rugged coastline around us in North Devon, as well as venturing up country and beyond. Helping us to deeply appreciate and remember our wanderings is our very own portable painting kit. </p>

There are four different ranges of colours to choose from, each with a different mood. Choose from:</p>

<p>Pure electric joy! Colours plucked from a candy coloured dream. These colours will light up your artwork like a fluorescent sign. Permanent Light Blue is like bubblegum.

<p>This brush fits in the tin in two separate parts - The brush with lid attached and the barrel with stopper. Water is stored in the barrel of the brush which is secured with a stopper. When you are ready to paint, the stopper can be stored in the base of the tin and the brush is screwed onto the barrel. Just squeeze the barrel gently when you want more water and let it flow through to clean the brush. A wide range of brush stroke thicknesses can be achieved.

<h2>Why we are passionate about Sketching Tins</h2>
<p>Both of us at Joan of Art are avid sketchers. We have enjoyed spending days together drawing around our local area since we first met. Our drawing days soon branched out to day trips further afield. And many of our happiest times have been spent travelling to new locations and drawing as much as we possibly can. From the very beginning of our drawing days, we have discussed and compared art materials, recommending techniques and tools to each other. These discussions and our sketching practise formed the basis of the development of the Sketching Tin.</p>
<p>Artists have been making their own homemade painting kits for a very long time. The practise of painting outdoors ('en plein air') became very popular in the mid 19th century with artists such as Claude Monet and J.M.W. Turner using Pochade boxes to capture the light on their subjects and in their landscapes. These were small painting kits typically made by adapting a cigar box. We were inspired by the historical use of painting kits but wanted ours to be more modern and even more compact than a Pochade box. We started by adapting vintage tins for our own use and were so impressed by how much refining our tool kit increased the effectiveness of our drawing that we continued to develop them, increasing the quality and functionality. Our trusty homemade companions have become the prototypes for the refined versions we hope to make. We have strived to discover all the highest quality elements for our tins and include all the best adaptions in one functional and durable kit.</p>
<p>We want everyone to be able to enjoy our favourite activity. We feel that too many people are so intimidated by the idea of being judged that they are too put off to try. But anyone can benefit from the positive effects of the process of making art. Whatever the aesthetic results are, they're not always relevant and they're certainly nobody else's business!</p>
<p>Sketching is good for stress relief, observational skills, memory retention, problem solving and just simply being happy. When you draw the world around you, you notice a whole new level of detail. Sketching helps you to see the world through new eyes.</p>
<p>Drawing is highly effective at enhancing connectivity between different parts of the brain. New research suggests it may even prevent age-related decline of cognitive functions. What more reason do you need to pick up a pencil or a paintbrush?</p>

<p>When this project is completed, we will be creating online galleries on our website joacreations.com. We will showcase submissions from sketchers around the world. We will also share tips on getting the most from sketching, inspirational nuggets and suggestions on what to draw and how to draw it. With your help, we aim to foster a global, online sketching community. Please join us! </p>

Joan of Art are Suki and Thea Wilkins. We are illustrators, artists, art event organisers. We practise all different art mediums but they all benefit from our love of sketching. We love exploring the forests and rugged coastline around us in North Devon, as well as venturing up country and beyond. Helping us to deeply appreciate and remember our wanderings is our very own portable painting kit. 

Thea sketching in Blenheim Palace Gardens
 
The Sketching Tin

The tin will be available in a choice of 2 different designs
The tin itself measures in at 9.5cm x 6.2cm and is 2.2 cm deep (3.7 x 2.4 x 0.9 inches).

The base and sides of the tins will be either brass or copper coloured
 
The Tin contains:

 
3 x watercolour half pans

Primary Watercolours in Sketching Tin
These are highly pigmented watercolours giving a concentrated hit of colour. A magnet on the bottom of the pan secures it to the base of the tin or the palette lid, or anything else metal. We have selected colours that are useful as individual shades and also have great colour mixing capabilities when used in combination. There are four different ranges of colours to choose from, each with a different mood. Choose from:
Primary -
1. Cerulean Blue, 2. Permanent Rose, 3. Yellow. 
Strong, bold shades. Really versatile for mixing a wide range of useful colours.


Neutral - 
1. Indigo, 2. Van Dyke Brown, 3. French Grey. 
For painting in tones. Indigo is inky, Van Dyke Brown is rich and sepia-like. French Grey is fresh, calm and sophisticated.


Earthy - 
1. Indigo, 2. Rose Madder, 3. Yellow Ochre. 
Ideal for rugged landscapes. Robust and rugged colours. Evocative of wood, earth, gorse and clay.


Neon - 
1. Permanent Light Blue, 2. Hot Pink, 3. Lemon Yellow. 
Pure electric joy! Colours plucked from a candy coloured dream. These colours will light up your artwork like a fluorescent sign. Permanent Light Blue is like bubblegum. Hot Pink is like a tropical ginger flower at full strength and candy floss when diluted. Lemon Yellow is effervescent and zingy. When mixed with Permanent Light Blue it creates a delicious aqua.


Waterbrush

This brush fits in the tin in two separate parts - The brush with lid attached and the barrel with stopper. Water is stored in the barrel of the brush which is secured with a stopper. When you are ready to paint, the stopper can be stored in the base of the tin and the brush is screwed onto the barrel. Just squeeze the barrel gently when you want more water and let it flow through to clean the brush. A wide range of brush stroke thicknesses can be achieved. From broad washes down to fine details - this brush has it covered! 

2B Pencil 
We think 2B is the ideal pencil grade for versatile sketching.

2B Tonal Range
Eraser 
Great for removing mistakes as well as adding highlights by taking away areas of pencil.
Pencil Sharpener 
This sturdy sharpener will keep your pencil lines clean and your details accurate.
Palette Lid 
The lid of the Sketching Tin is coated white for easy mixing of colours and wipes clean easily.
Cotton Cuff

Make your water go further by cleaning your brush on your wrist cuff before you squeeze water through it. Our wrist cuffs will be embroidered with our logo in black thread. We keep ours stretched over our Sketching Tins to protect the tin and for easy carrying.

Embroidered Wrist Cuff
The Sketching Tin Manual
Complete with colour wheel, gradients to demonstrate the scope of the colours, tips and ideas for sketching subjects and techniques.

<p>Fantasy and romance are handfasted together in this, my first <br/><br/>collection of artistic portraits. I have gathered the pieces of my <br/><br/>dreamscape to weave together a world of fairytale into singular <br/><br/>images where my subjects are transformed from mere humans into <br/><br/>fantastical creatures of beauty and magic. <br/></p>
<p>Inspired by the work of Brian and Wendy Froud, the tales of the <br/><br/>Brother's Grimm, and the puppetry of Jim Henson in the Dark <br/><br/>Crystal and The Labyrinth, I lay awake nights stirring the cauldron <br/><br/>of inspiration and emerging with new ideas and stories. <br/></p>
<p>The results are photographic collages designed to evoke feelings <br/><br/>of love and wonder in the viewer. To me these pieces feel simply <br/><br/>like coming home, even if my ""Secret Garden"" only exists in my <br/><br/>mind and on paper.</p>
<p>This campaign is a means to allow me to create prints of the first 20 <br/><br/>images needed for my Gallery showing this November. I have managed to <br/><br/>fund enough for a handful of prints but I need a little bit more help to <br/><br/>get these images out to the world. I started by showing a few friends <br/><br/>what I had created and through their encouragement I am hoping to share <br/><br/>my art with everyone who needs a little magic in their lives. Anyone <br/><br/>contributing, even a few dollars helps me bring a little bit of that <br/><br/>magic to those who can appreciate it. <br/></p>
<p><b><br/></b></p>
<h2><b>What We Need &amp; What You Get </b></h2>
</div><div>The money raised through this campaign allows me to purchase high <br/><br/>quality gallery wraps of the images and to ship and hang them. Each <br/><br/>gallery wrap costs approximately $100 to print and that does not include <br/><br/>the shipping or hanging fees. I have tried to raise the money myself by <br/><br/>selling smaller versions of the prints, but there is not enough <br/><br/>awareness of the images as the gallery show has not yet opened. This <br/><br/>opens up a unique opportunity for those who are helping out at this <br/><br/>early stage. Contributions to this campaign can earn you pre-released <br/><br/>limited edition prints, as well as other fun products, like postcards <br/><br/>and magnets. If I don't reach the goal, whatever money is raised will go <br/><br/>towards gallery wraps. If I make more than I am looking for it will go <br/><br/>towards advertising and celebrating the opening as well as submission <br/><br/>fees for additional galleries Nationwide.<br/><br/>
</div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p></p>Growing up I had some challenges, I often escaped into my imagination. I <br/><br/>created beauty where there was only dismay and fear. Through the <br/><br/>creation of these invisible worlds I found my voice and my inner <br/><br/>strength. Not every image in my Garden is one of beauty, because even <br/><br/>roses have thorns, but in acknowledging the darker side of my mind I saw <br/><br/>where my light would best be served. Sharing this Garden with the world, <br/><br/>telling my own fairytales, I hope I show others that there is a Secret <br/><br/>Garden within them. A fantastical inner strength that given the right <br/><br/>nourishment can grow and bring light to others. Inspire them to grow. I <br/><br/>have already found interested galleries, there is already a call for my <br/><br/>work, I have taken it this far, I simply need the funds to make it a <br/><br/>reality. I have signed a contract with a gallery in Northampton MA. I <br/><br/>can create enough images to meet the minimum, but there is so much more <br/><br/>to share than that. So many more stories to tell.<br/><br/>
</div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>As I mentioned I can meet the minimum requirements of the gallery, but <br/><br/>the images will be smaller and have less of an impact. I will have 2 <br/><br/>additional opportunities to show more than just what will hang in the <br/><br/>gallery on the day to day for the 2 months of the show. I want to show a <br/><br/>much of the images as possible. I am nothing if not determined. Once I <br/><br/>realized the value people saw in my work I decided I would make this <br/><br/>happen. I created my first image in February and less than 6 months <br/><br/>later have had interest from a number of gallery locations. I continue <br/><br/>to create one image a day. I continue to post these publicly on my <br/><br/>facebook gallery. I continue to gain interest and attention from others. <br/><br/>It is my intention to continue to put my work out there. I will also be <br/><br/>selling the limited edition prints online as soon as I complete my <br/><br/>gallery website. I further continue to participate in public events that <br/><br/>bring awareness to my art project, such as craft fairs and art <br/><br/>festivals.<br/><br/>
</div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>Besides donations you can help by ""liking"" and ""sharing"" my facebook <br/><br/>gallery: <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/secretgardenart"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.facebook.com/secretgardenart</a> or by ""sharing"" your <br/><br/>favorite images and voting on them to help me decide which ones will end <br/><br/>up in the gallery. I also wouldn't be opposed to connections with other <br/><br/>galleries that may be interested in featuring my work. And of course by <br/><br/>sharing this Indiegogo campaign with the art lovers in your life.<br/>

If I make more than I am looking for it will go towards advertising and celebrating the opening as well as submission fees for additional galleries Nationwide.
  The Impact Growing up I had some challenges, I often escaped into my imagination. I created beauty where there was only dismay and fear. Through the creation of these invisible worlds I found my voice and my inner strength. Not every image in my Garden is one of beauty, because even roses have thorns, but in acknowledging the darker side of my mind I saw where my light would best be served. Sharing this Garden with the world, telling my own fairytales, I hope I show others that there is a Secret Garden within them. A fantastical inner strength that given the right nourishment can grow and bring light to others. Inspire them to grow. I have already found interested galleries, there is already a call for my work, I have taken it this far, I simply need the funds to make it a reality. I have signed a contract with a gallery in Northampton MA. I can create enough images to meet the minimum, but there is so much more to share than that. So many more stories to tell.
  Risks & ChallengesAs I mentioned I can meet the minimum requirements of the gallery, but the images will be smaller and have less of an impact. I will have 2 additional opportunities to show more than just what will hang in the gallery on the day to day for the 2 months of the show. I want to show a much of the images as possible. I am nothing if not determined. Once I realized the value people saw in my work I decided I would make this happen. I created my first image in February and less than 6 months later have had interest from a number of gallery locations. I continue to create one image a day. I continue to post these publicly on my facebook gallery. I continue to gain interest and attention from others. It is my intention to continue to put my work out there. I will also be selling the limited edition prints online as soon as I complete my gallery website. I further continue to participate in public events that bring awareness to my art project, such as craft fairs and art festivals.
  Other Ways You Can HelpBesides donations you can help by ""liking"" and ""sharing"" my facebook gallery: https://www.facebook.com/secretgardenart or by ""sharing"" your favorite images and voting on them to help me decide which ones will end up in the gallery. I also wouldn't be opposed to connections with other galleries that may be interested in featuring my work. And of course by sharing this Indiegogo campaign with the art lovers in your life.",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<p><strong>Nicolas P. Macdonald (""Nickdemus"")</strong> is a sustainble artist based in Eugene, Oregon, USA. Nicolas employs local artists whose talents combine to create the most highly detailed vision possible. Materials used are all sustainably harvested, re-used or recycled. His emphassis is on art that is tangible and fully interactive. Nicolas is a wordly man put simply. Being born in South Africa, he learned innumerable resourceful ways to make self sustaining projects in some of the harshest climates offered up by the Earth. </p>
<h3><strong>I.  Nickdemus is currently bringing ""Rocket"" Science to the                        indigenous tribes and communities of Agato, Ecuador!</strong></h3>
<p>                 <strong>A ""Rocket Stove"" is:</strong></p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;""><span><strong>* Made with recycled and raw materials</strong></span></p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;""><strong>* A pizza oven, bread oven, surface stove and water purifier</strong></p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;""><span><strong>*A radiant area heater that can heat in EXCESS of 1000 degrees!!!</strong></span></p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;""><span><strong>* Eco-clean with no smoke or emissions</strong></span></p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;""><span><strong>*Uses 1/8 the wood normally required!</strong></span></p>
<p><span><strong><br/><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">""ROCKET"" SCIENCE: AGATO  2012</span></strong> is a 3 part, 3 month project bringing the Rocket Stove technologies to tribes, school children and indigenous artisans of Agato, Ecuador.  Only 1 in 50 people have access to heat and clean water in Agato.  They are left to cook and boil water on ground fires made of corncobs and eucalyptus wood.  These fires cause a lot of smoke and inefficiently use EIGHT times the wood of a Rocket Stove. </span>In an area where the average monthly income is $240, the Rocket Stove can greatly enhance the quality of life for the greater community of Agato!</p>
<p><strong>1. The Demonstration Model: Rocket Stove</strong></p>
<p><span>    This portable Rocket Stove unit is being built on the farm of a local family.  Once completed, Nicolas &amp; others will be able to travel with the stove to demonstrate &amp; teach how to build the stove in Agato's many indigenous communities.  The main focus of the portable unit is to be able to take it far into the forests to share the Rocket Stove technology with those in very remote areas.</span></p>
<p><strong>2. The Montessori School:  Rocket Stove</strong></p>
<p><strong>    </strong>30+ school children will benefit from this Rocket Stove!  This unique model features an earth bench running the length of the school.  The radiant heating surface will help provide the children with purified water and nutritious food.  It will also keep them warm this winter and for many more to come!!!</p>
<p><strong>3. The Living Museum: Rocket Stove/Kiln</strong></p>
<p>  The Living Museum is run by indigenous artisans who are preserving and showing the arts &amp; cultures of the area's many tribes.  Showcasing the traditional fashion, weaving, fabrics and pottery of Agato's growing community of over 500 Indigenous Artisans, The Living Museum is a thriving cultural center serving the local population of 10,000 and representing Agato to the world!  The museum serves at least 30 local children as a school and many more as an after-school recreational area.  They also have free workshops for local adults who want to learn English.  A popular place for community gatherings, workshops and classes- The Living Museum is ready for a Rocket Stove!  </p>
<p>  Set in a 5 building decomissioned hydro-electric plant, The Living Museum will greatly benefit from a VERY large Rocket Stove that serves as a communal cooking surface, radiant area heater and kiln. This Rocket Stove is to be built in the communal courtyard/kitchen area and will heat 250sq. feet. The artisans are very excited about the role the Kiln will play in reviving indigenous pottery and ceramics!</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>II. RESOURCES</h3>
While Nickdemus sources re-used and recycled material, he still needs tools, some materials, and transportation to do the demonstrations.  As a one-man TRUE Do-It-Yourselfer, Nickdemus must spend 40-50 hours sourcing the necessary materials + another 40-50 hours actually building each Rocket Stove!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Some of the tools needed are: Grinders, hammers, rock chisel, hand saws, cement trowels, wheelbarrows &amp; shovels.  The tools will be left in Agato so that the indigenous people may continue building Rocket Stoves.</div>

<p>Nickdemus has gotten to Ecuador and has already gotten started gathering materials and working on the first two projects.  To finish the projects Nickdemus is counting on YOU!  He has limited and infrequent access to phones, internet, etc. while working in these remote areas.  As such, The Ecoartbuilder Team is here to provide updates and answer any questions you may have to the best of our ability.  With your help, we look forward to doubling &amp; even tripling our goal!  In truth, our base goal in no way comes close to covering the costs of labor for these projects.  These projects require a minimum of 240-270 labor hours to complete.  Nickdemus makes his livelihood with his eco art projects and has many projects empowering Global Citizens with EcoArt, Ecotecture and ""Rocket"" Science on the horizon.  </p>
<h2>This campaign will assist Nickdemus in continuing to offer such incredible services to communities in need AT NO CHARGE to the community!!! We thank you in advance for your support of this incredible project!</h2>
<div> </div>
<div>You can make a pledge today for as little as $10 and provide five children in Agato with access to heat and clean drinking water! 60+ school children and 500+ indigenous artisans will be benefitting directly from these projects!  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>The Ecoartbuilder Team will keep you informed every step of the way!  In the preposterously absurd, bizarro outcome in which the funding goal is not met, we may have to change the scope of the project.  We would say we promise to keep you informed if that happens.....but it wont, so, in truth, we don't have much to say about THAT because we ARE meeting our goal!</div>
<div> </div>
<h3>Thank you for sharing this project with your online networks, your facebook friends, your eco-friendly and green living networks, your church or spiritual center and absolutely EVERYONE you can think of who can support the success of this amazing project!!!  This is THE REAL DEAL.  No huge organization, no middle man- your pledges go DIRECTLY to assist the Indigenous Tribes of Agato, Ecuador!  </h3>

</div></div>","Nicolas P. Macdonald (""Nickdemus"") is a sustainble artist based in Eugene, Oregon, USA. Nicolas employs local artists whose talents combine to create the most highly detailed vision possible. Materials used are all sustainably harvested, re-used or recycled. His emphassis is on art that is tangible and fully interactive. Nicolas is a wordly man put simply. Being born in South Africa, he learned innumerable resourceful ways to make self sustaining projects in some of the harshest climates offered up by the Earth. 
I.  Nickdemus is currently bringing ""Rocket"" Science to the                        indigenous tribes and communities of Agato, Ecuador!
                 A ""Rocket Stove"" is:
* Made with recycled and raw materials
* A pizza oven, bread oven, surface stove and water purifier
*A radiant area heater that can heat in EXCESS of 1000 degrees!!!
* Eco-clean with no smoke or emissions
*Uses 1/8 the wood normally required!
""ROCKET"" SCIENCE: AGATO  2012 is a 3 part, 3 month project bringing the Rocket Stove technologies to tribes, school children and indigenous artisans of Agato, Ecuador.  Only 1 in 50 people have access to heat and clean water in Agato.  They are left to cook and boil water on ground fires made of corncobs and eucalyptus wood.  These fires cause a lot of smoke and inefficiently use EIGHT times the wood of a Rocket Stove. In an area where the average monthly income is $240, the Rocket Stove can greatly enhance the quality of life for the greater community of Agato!
1. The Demonstration Model: Rocket Stove
    This portable Rocket Stove unit is being built on the farm of a local family.  Once completed, Nicolas & others will be able to travel with the stove to demonstrate & teach how to build the stove in Agato's many indigenous communities.  The main focus of the portable unit is to be able to take it far into the forests to share the Rocket Stove technology with those in very remote areas.
2. The Montessori School:  Rocket Stove
    30+ school children will benefit from this Rocket Stove!  This unique model features an earth bench running the length of the school.  The radiant heating surface will help provide the children with purified water and nutritious food.  It will also keep them warm this winter and for many more to come!!!
3. The Living Museum: Rocket Stove/Kiln
  The Living Museum is run by indigenous artisans who are preserving and showing the arts & cultures of the area's many tribes.  Showcasing the traditional fashion, weaving, fabrics and pottery of Agato's growing community of over 500 Indigenous Artisans, The Living Museum is a thriving cultural center serving the local population of 10,000 and representing Agato to the world!  The museum serves at least 30 local children as a school and many more as an after-school recreational area.  They also have free workshops for local adults who want to learn English.  A popular place for community gatherings, workshops and classes- The Living Museum is ready for a Rocket Stove!  
  Set in a 5 building decomissioned hydro-electric plant, The Living Museum will greatly benefit from a VERY large Rocket Stove that serves as a communal cooking surface, radiant area heater and kiln. This Rocket Stove is to be built in the communal courtyard/kitchen area and will heat 250sq. feet. The artisans are very excited about the role the Kiln will play in reviving indigenous pottery and ceramics!
 
II. RESOURCES
While Nickdemus sources re-used and recycled material, he still needs tools, some materials, and transportation to do the demonstrations.  As a one-man TRUE Do-It-Yourselfer, Nickdemus must spend 40-50 hours sourcing the necessary materials + another 40-50 hours actually building each Rocket Stove!
 
Some of the tools needed are: Grinders, hammers, rock chisel, hand saws, cement trowels, wheelbarrows & shovels.  The tools will be left in Agato so that the indigenous people may continue building Rocket Stoves.

We have the steel platform, an OSHA approved ladder to get to the second level, and sound system
We have an amazing Crew that includes Bay Area DJs, electrical engineers, mechanical and structural engineers, concept artists, camp organizers and a dedicated support crew. In total there'll be 50 of us on the Playa, helping make Airpusher's Steam Punk Airship happen
Outside of this campaign, in the last 30 days we've raised more than $7,500 from the Airpusher crew members alone


What we are asking for:
We have broken our needs into 3 phases.  We've already raised funds for Phase 1, this campaign is all about Phase 2:


Phase 1: $7,500 - Maintenance, Storage, and Legalities --> Raised from Crew


Phase 2: $9,500 -  Airship Transformation  --> This campaign
Blimp: $2000
Cloud around hull: $1500
Rent: $1000 (May 1 through Oct 1)
Generator renter for playa: $1000
Ladder: $500
DJ structure: $500
Lighting: $500
Ship Hull: $500
Arms (for aerialists): $500

Phase 3: $5,000 - Special Touches for an extra special airship --> If we exceed our goals

You can make this happen!

<h2><strong>What is <em>Etiquette</em>?</strong></h2>
<p><em>Etiquette </em>had its first exhibition in 2010 and started functioning as an ongoing artistic platform in 2011. Since then, it has organised and curated exhibitions, readings, film screenings and workshops, each one dedicated to showcasing creative and critical work by established, emerging and aspiring women artists. Addressing gender as a subject of discourse, <em>Etiquette</em> uses art as a tool to create spaces within which critical and creative conversations can take place.</p>
<p>By mid-2013, <em>Etiquette </em>will have featured the works of over 70 artists, performers, writers, filmmakers, academics and curators as well as platformed a spectrum of gender issues and women’s concerns. It is also in the process of having its first anthology of women's writing published and its blog revamped; currenty the Etiquette blog features numerous articles as well as interviews the curators have conducted with international practitioners making feminist waves across the globe.<br/><br/></p>
<h2><strong>Why fund <em>Etiquette</em>?</strong></h2>
<p>By the end of 2013, we will be registering <em>Etiquette </em>as a non-for-profit arts group dedicated to showcasing creative and critical work by  women artists. We need your help to finance its exhibitions/screenings/gigs/readings/performances over the course of 2013, to formalise operations, streamline it processes and show our eventual backers that we have an engaged you with the work we have done so far. We believe that <em>Etiquette</em> fills a gap in discourse that is reflective of a glaring, gender-based power imbalance within the global artistic landscape. </p>

Many of Seattle’s kids do not have anywhere to go this summer. Due to lack of ability to pay, and/or lack of a positive and productive environment during summertime many kids do not have access to unique artistic opportunities that could enrich their lives.  We all know the trouble that can happen to kids who are idle during the summer.  
Our solution: Circus Camp!
To enlighten and inspire kids we have taken many kids to trips to the famous Cirque du Soleil in the past (see here). We love circus arts. We feel the circus is a great fun way to inspire creativity in kids.  Now in partnership with the City of Seattle’s Parks and Recreation, we want to teach kids circus arts this summer.
But to pull this off successfully we need your help!
My goal is to help kids discover the creativity and gifting they have within so they can learn to express their individual artist and become confident creators.  I believe poverty can be overcome as individuals comes to discover their gifting and learn how to create and share from who they really are. 
Our Circus Arts program, which will last about 2 months, will include lessons in juggling, tumbling, hula hoop tricks, clowning, drama, and academics. We have a powerful opportunity to reach many young people in need (1400+) through our partnership with Seattle Parks & Recreation's Arts in the Park program, the Summer Sack Lunch Program, and the Shunpike Arts Collective (our fiscal sponsor!)  It will take place in Judkin's Park in Central Seattle.  Please be a part of it.
How you can help:
Please consider making a cash donation.  
Your contribution will:


Give kids and teens the opportunity to be exposed to unique and positive circus arts, fitness, academics, and healthy eating during out-of-school time.


Create community, better neighborhoods, and positive involvement for children and families.


Help us afford the equipment and supplies we want for the camp.


Help us effectively promote the camp to kids. 


Help support the circus arts professionals and trainers who will offer their time and expertise to the young people.

 
 
The Bad News: If we don’t raise the entire amount, we will not be able to create the look and feel of the circus that we want for the kids.  We will also have to cut corners by getting less equipment, and paying our staff next to nothing.  Most of whom can’t afford to spend 2 months working for free.  But let's not think about that. Instead let's focus on... 
The Good News:  For your generosity, the kids in Seattle say thanks--and they’re so cute, and eager to participate in whatever we offer, and appreciative.  (If I had permission to film them, you would see.  One little boy was so excited today that he wanted to run home with the juggling balls to show his mother!)  And we send you a million thanks too!
We have tried to come up with some unique circus-themed collectibles from our friends at Cirque du Soleil in return for your gifts of kindness.  Choose a perk on the right->
 
Other Ways You Can Help
 


TELL YOUR FRIENDS!  Please forward this via email, Facebook and Twitter to get the word out and make some noise about this campaign!  You can do it right here on Indiegogo! Let's go viral! 


Donate circus related equipment and supplies.  We still need: Any and all art supplies, circus style hats, costumes and decorations.  Tumbling mats.  Did I say tumbling mats!  Teachers of tumbling, juggling, hula hooping and any other circus related arts.  Snacks!

<h3>Hi There!</h3>
<p>My name is Phil Servita, and I build things. I also like elephants, and I've been known to attend Burning Man now and then.

<p>The Playa, and Burning Man, need more elephants. Elephants that are OK with people sitting inside their brightly lit and optically pulsating bellies, while jungle sounds, music strangely overcome with tubas (because tubas imply elephants, don't they?), audio collages probably best to not play in the workplace, calming sounds of nature, and occasionally not-so-calming sounds of nature, like that tiger over there that's currently taking out a gazelle for lunch.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>Now, in addition to the task of fabrication, bringing an Art Car to Burning Man is a logistical challenge in an of itself. This is where the engineering aspect of the project comes into play. This Elephant Art Car will not only provide surrealist entertainment wherever it wanders but it is designed in such a way such that transporting it can be handled by a single human being. No large crews of 15 people trying to push it up shaky ramps onto a shipping container. This project will completely break down into pieces small enough to be handled by one person, and be easily assembled at Burning Man or any other destination. Space wise, the goal is for the entire art car to be able to be collapsed into the space of a single Boston Burning Truck share. This, for non Boston Burning Man people, is only 100 cubic feet. All parts of the locomotive frame are modular, and being fabricated from scratch, in order to produce a modular  ""Art Car Construction Kit""; different engines, front ends, rear ends, etc will be able to be interfaced with the parts made for the Elephant, to produce other kinetic art in the future.

</div></div>","Our Story            
We are a group of 13 UK artists who have been invited by FLAG STOP, an
alternative contemporary art event in LA, to prepare a special exhibition for this
landmark event - bringing some of the UK’s most ambitious, emerging artists to
LA. 
We will exhibit in the London Art
Box (or ‘LAB’), a London ‘micro-gallery’ at FLAG STOP. The LAB isn’t
your typical tea party gathering - we will be staging impromptu discussions,
creating a dialogue about contemporary art, regularly re-arranging the
exhibition and inviting visitors to help curate the space. We really want this
to be an interactive, engaging, learning experience for visitors.
We are all associated with London’s
Debut Contemporary, a unique mentoring &
exhibiting platform for emerging artists, who we will be representing at the
event. 
 
The Impact
This is a very exciting and potentially career expanding opportunity for
all the artists that have been selected, and will enable us to help raise support for FLAG STOP’s charitable beneficiary, Switzer Learning Center, a special
education school and treatment program. Your contributions, big or small, will
be helping on many levels. 
We are not just shipping work to LA – we are providing an interactive,
performative presence. We will be turning heads! In order to achieve this we
are aiming for as many of us as possible to travel to the show.
 
What We Need & What We Have For You!
We would love for you to help make this possible - and as we are an
extremely talented bunch of lovely artists we have some incredible
""perks"" to let you know grateful we are for your help! 
 
The artists have kindly donated some stunning art pieces which can be
yours if you contribute to this campaign. These artworks are usually at least
twice the ‘contribution price’ listed here, so this is really an incredible opportunity
to get some original artworks for a fraction of the price – a very rare
opportunity with this calibre of artist, and it is only possible for the
duration of this campaign. (Any works not claimed will be returning to their
original price). More details below.
 
The closer you help us get to our funding target of $10000 the more of us
will actually be able to get over there and give a taste of British live art to
this awesome LA event as well as showcase the artwork we have produced. 
 
Details: What we need 
 
$10000 will make this happen by funding:
 
- Crates constructed to ship artwork to LA
- Shipping costs both to LA and back again for the artwork
- Insurance of artwork in transit and during the event
- Flights to LA 
- Basic accommodation whilst in LA
 
Details:  What we have for you
 
Firstly we are offering artwork postcards signed by the artists. 50 of
each design will be created to make up this exclusive
collection.
 
Now that's pretty good in itself but we have a really incredible
opportunity for you as well: All the artists are offering original works of
art! This is a fantastic chance to own artwork from these successful emerging
artists –  each very talented and
collectable. Currently exhibiting in London and represented by Notting Hill
based gallery Debut Contemporary, we have all successfully shown in other locations
as well.
A few of the places we have exhibited: The
Venice Biennale (Chantal
Powell), Tate Britain (Akleriah), Tate
Modern (Nicola Anthony), Salzburg (Twinkle Troughton) and Poland (Kimi Wylde). Collectors of their work
are in many countries and include Banksy and Bill Woodrow (Tinsel Edwards). They have worked
with clients such as Jerry
Lewis and Groove Armada (Katrina James) and have had work
auctioned by high profile Christies auctioneer Hugh Edmeades. 
 
This is a wonderful way to get a piece of collectable contemporary art
whilst supporting the artists in furthering their careers! Its not just a
donation to us, it's also an art investment for you!
 
The Artists
As a group artists, our unique practices are diverse
- including painters, photographers, artists working in the 3 dimensional arena
and performance artists. You can find out more about our individual artwork by
looking at the profiles in the ""team"" section. You will also find
links there to our personal websites showing full portfolios of our work. We
will also be posting many images in the gallery section of this site so keep
looking!

<h2>About Project ""White and Red""</h2>
<p>Hi everybody. I am a Patient No.6. I am interested in troubleshooting creative people trough psychiatry and psychiatry in general. Under the intense influence of these horrible things I’ve created a Patient No.6 and today I ask you to help me with the project “White and Red”. These are six 5-inch toys</p>
<p>1. the first toy is named - Scull of Patient No.6</p>
<p>2. the second toy is named Gagarin in Rocket</p>
<p>3. the third toy is named - “Patient No.6 in car”</p>
<p>4. afourth toy is named – “Doctor”</p>
<p>5. afifth toy is named-“Patient No.6 Rabbit mask”</p>
<p>6. and a sixth toy is named-“Patient No.6 after lobotomy”</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">These figures are completely different from those, which you see in the world of designer toys every day. Then, as one famous person said – there is something inside and something  outside. And Patient No.6 – is something inside.</p>

Hi everybody. I am a Patient No.6. I am interested in troubleshooting creative people trough psychiatry and psychiatry in general. Under the intense influence of these horrible things I’ve created a Patient No.6 and today I ask you to help me with the project “White and Red”. These are six 5-inch toys
1. the first toy is named - Scull of Patient No.6
2. the second toy is named Gagarin in Rocket
3. the third toy is named - “Patient No.6 in car”
4. afourth toy is named – “Doctor”
5. afifth toy is named-“Patient No.6 Rabbit mask”
6. and a sixth toy is named-“Patient No.6 after lobotomy”
These figures are completely different from those, which you see in the world of designer toys every day. Then, as one famous person said – there is something inside and something  outside. And Patient No.6 – is something inside.

                
  What I Need & What You Get



For realization this project a reality I need the money, I have a little bit, but that's not enough for this purpose. Means that you give will be used to complete the purchase of materials and equipment. You are investing not only the current draft, but the future too, and in return you get a quality psychiatric art.  I promise you this…


The Patient No.6 story
Patient â„– 6 - is a creative person's head which breaks his imagination (no earthly creature ). There is nothing wrong, but society does not need is not predictable people, for this reason he has for many years undergoing treatment in a psychiatric hospital… But talent does not kill…
Here some publications about Patient No.6:

<h3><b>In 2008 I opened an art gallery named Gallerysmith</b></h3><p>
</p><p>My surname is Smith so the name
represents not only who I am but what I do. Gallerysmith represents visual
artists in the traditional way and in the 6 years since we opened, we have
helped many artists to reach their potential by assisting them to develop their
practices, by matching them to curatorial opportunities and by developing
collector interest in their work. While working hard for our artists, we have
developed a strong client base of collectors and a community of art lovers who
look forward to seeing our annual program unfold. Someone recently quipped that
the Gallerysmith community is like a book of fascinating characters (the
opening chapter begins with a 70 year old artist with a grey pony tail who arrives at
the gallery to tell me about his new work. He is animated
and excited, throwing his arms about in a manner reminiscent of the way
he applies oil paint to canvas. In walks a young stylish woman with cropped black
hair covered in loose pigment whose studio is upstairs. She begins a conversation
about her work in progress and the older artist tells the younger woman to turn
her paintings upside down so she can can see them more clearly. In the midst of this
creative exchange, a truck pulls up to deliver the works for an upcoming
exhibition. We count the works and while the consignment note is being signed, a collector arrives to
preview the new work. I greet him and offer a cup of tea. He is excited because
he has been waiting for months to see this work emerge from the studio. The phone
rings. It is a client who wants to talk more about the images I emailed her
this morning ...) This is a typical scene, but I digress...</p><h4>
What do we want to do?</h4><div>
<p>We (I use the first person plural because the gallery is its own character too) are indebted to our community of art lovers and we want to continue to engage them with new and exciting work, so we want to broaden our offer by opening an additional space called <b>GALLERYSMITH PROJECT SPACE</b>. Our vision for this new gallery (in an existing but disused gallery space upstairs and on the same premises) is to create real opportunities for younger artists by connecting them with our established audience, thereby bumping along their careers. We will work with artists for short-term projects rather than as longer term relationships.<br/></p>
<h4>When is it happening?</h4>
<p>It has all come together so quickly. My Gallery Manager (she is on the left, I am on the right of the above pic) hatched the idea two months ago. Since then we have developed a strategy and are launching in August. Our branding is done. Our facebook page has attracted 560 likes. The space is almost ready to go and we have exhibitions booked for the rest of the year. But we need a little bit of extra capital to give the launch some va va voom so we can begin to attract more applicants. <br/></p>
<h4>What do we need?</h4>
<p>Prior to the launch, we need to: <br/></p>
<ul>
<li>paint the entrance and foyer, ($690)<br/>
</li>
<li>install some vinyl signage, ($155)<br/>
</li>
<li>set up website hosting, ($49) <br/>
</li>
<li>design a simple free website (most of the foundation work is complete), ($0)<br/>
</li>
<li>distribute an EDM with details of the launch to our established client base (design completed) ($181).</li>
</ul>
<p>At the launch we will have:</p>
<ul>
<li>a group exhibition showcasing work by artists of the calibre we want to attract (already curated), ($0)<br/>
</li>
<li>a dj playing some experimental music, ($150)<br/>
</li>
<li>a dance performance in the space, ($150)<br/>
</li>
<li>a photographer and branded backdrop to take social shots ($450)</li>
<li>bar staff ($120)<br/>
</li>
<li>drinks and some simple nibbles. ($550)<br/>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>TOTAL CAPITAL needed = $2,495<br/>
</h3>
<h4><br/></h4>
<h4>Why a big launch?</h4>
<p>Good question. Well, in a nutshell, we need the launch to be super dooper to set the scene. All of the photographic content from the launch will feed into our social media, facebook page, instagram, website and blog to present a vibrant gallery atmosphere that will attract more collectors to future events. A higher level of collector interest will appeal to artists and this will translate to an increase in the calibre of the applications.</p>
<p>If we don't reach our goal, we will still launch, but we will not be able to create the buzz we need to build the momentum. The vitality of the launch and the initial energy will be self fulfilling. Once the project space is up and running it will be self-funding. <br/></p>
<h4>Why support us?</h4>
<p>For six years I have supported artists in largely tangible but often intangible ways. I have encouraged them, shared in their triumphs, mentored them, cooked for them, put them up in my spare room, opened proverbial doors for them, celebrated with them, taken the heat for them when the chips are down, offered advice, a shoulder, a coffee. I love what we do and the Gallerysmith community loves us and our artists. We have firmly established the careers of a number of fledgeling artists by hosting their first major exhibitions (Nici Cumpston, Siri Hayes, Tony Albert, TextaQueen, Eric Bridgeman, Lucas Grogan, Catherine Nelson all of whom are now recognised and have solid reputations). Gallerysmith Project Space will allow us to cast our net more widely and give us the opportuniity to identify other young hopefuls but work with them in a project rather than on ongoing context. <br/></p>
<p>Financially, we just need a small snowball that we can roll down the hill.<br/></p>

We do street art, photography and film, and at the moment we're using these art-forms in an on-going art project called “Share The Word”. The idea is simple : we ask people who live in slums to give us words that we then turn into street art. Each family gives us one word that they want to share with the outside world, and we then paint this word on their house. In this project we use graffiti to bring the focus on a specific community through its own words. The art is the result of an interaction between us and the environment, and it becomes a bridge between the community and the outside world. Involving the local children and getting them to help us is always a priority, especially in places where not all children go to school and where art education is non-existent.</p><p>From our experience, slums are vibrant places full of interesting and creative people. Unfortunately they are cut off from the rest of society, ignored or forgotten by many governments. If we want to build a more equal world, we need to include these communities, interact with them, and learn from them. Our photography and film work aim not only to showcase our street art, but to bring attention to these often ignored communities.</p><p>After having taken Share The Word project to low income neighbourhoods of Indonesia, Kenya and Nepal, we now want to take the project to Colombia. In August 2014, we will spend 5 weeks in a slum of Bogota, painting street art on people's houses, and getting the kids involved in the project.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/668791/files/20140623075652-SPG_5903.jpg?1403535412"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/668906/files/20140623083733-SPG_5263.jpg?1403537853"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p></p><h1>How you can help</h1><p>You can help us by sending some money that will be used for the project in Colombia to pay for transport, paint, food and accommodation.

<h1>How we make an impact</h1>
<p>A typical day on a Share The Word project starts with us going to the slum looking for a nice wall to paint. When we've found one, we ask the family whose wall it is, to give a word that they would like to share. It may be in any language or script. As soon as they give us the word, we start painting, using spray paint, rollers, paint brushes or whatever we can get our hands on. The mural is improvised, inspired by the place, the people and the meaning of the word itself.</p>
<p>The first 3 episodes of Share The Word project in Indonesia, Kenya and Nepal were very successful. The locals welcomed the project and were very enthusiastic. It was very interesting both for them and us to interact and learn from each other. In all these places, our project was talked about in the newspapers, magazines and on the internet in the countries we were working in. The inhabitants of the slums felt a little prouder of their neighbourhood, felt inspired and more connected to the outside world. In Nepal, many tourists came to the slum to have a look at the art. In Indonesia and Kenya, inhabitants of wealthier areas started coming into the slum to have a look at the art too. As a result of this, the people from the slum and the people from the outside interacted and exchanged for the first time.</p>
<p>We feel that this sort of interaction is a small step towards a more equal society. We feel that bringing attention on a slum through art is a way of making people think differently about these communities.</p>

<br/><p></p>
<h1>The challenges we face</h1>
<p>The main challenge for us is to stay safe in a sometimes hostile environment. The vast majority of people who live in slums are very friendly and welcoming, but like everywhere, we also meet people with not-so-good intentions. However, slums are forgotten by the local police and security remains a major issue.</p>
<p>Our experience of working in slums has taught us how to deal with this issue. We are always extremely cautious when we first enter the slum, and start by introducing ourselves and explaining our project to the community leaders. Since government laws often don't always apply to marginalised communities, we use common sense and a lot of respect in order to stay safe and work efficiently. We are now very confident about going into marginalised communities, and we know our project will be appreciated.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h1>A long term project</h1>
<p>Share The Word project is an ongoing project that started in August 2013 in a low income neighbourhood of Jakarta, Indonesia. Since then we worked in Nairobi, Kenya, and Kathmandu, Nepal. You can help us take this project further by contributing to the project in Bogota in August. After that, we will set up art exhebitions to show our work in more detail and help pay for future episodes in many other places. In the future we would also like to return to neighborhoods previously visited to work their again and see how things have changed.</p>

<p>Nous sommes Seb Toussaint, et Spag, deux artistes respectivement britannique et français, regroupés sous le nom d'Outsiders Krew.

L'art devient ainsi un pont entre la communauté du bidonville et le monde extérieur.

<p>Après avoir mené ce projet en Indonésie, au Kenya et au Népal, nous souhaitons pouvoir mettre en place notre projet en Colombie. En Août 2014, nous irons passer 5 semaines dans un quartier marginalisé de Bogota, pour peindre les maisons des habitants et faire participer la jeunesse locale.</p>

<h1>L'impact du projet :</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Une journée type sur un épisode Share The Word commence, une fois le quartier trouvé, par la recherche d'un mur à peindre suffisamment ""bon"" (hauteur, type de surface, visibilité, etc...). Nous demandons ensuite à son ou ses propriétaires de nous donner un mot qu'ils souhaitent partager. Il peut être exprimé en n'importe quelle langue et dans n'importe quel alphabet ou caractère. Dès que ce mot nous est donné, nous commençons à peindre en utilisant principalement de la peinture classique pour surface extérieure étalée avec des rouleaux et pinceaux mais aussi de la peinture aérosol pour les détails généralement. <span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">Chaque fresque est improvisée et inspirée par l’environnement, le lieu, ses habitants et le sens du mot que l'on peint.</span></p>
<p>Les 3 premiers épisodes de Share The Word ont été un succès total ! Les locaux ont à chaque fois été très accueillants et enthousiastes vis-à-vis du projet. Il était très intéressant à la fois pour nous, et pour les locaux, d'échanger et d'apprendre de nos cultures et de nos différences. Dans chaque pays où nous avons travaillé, les médias locaux ont parlé du projet. Les habitants se sont sentis plus fiers de leur quartier. Grâce à l'art, ces lieux se sont un peu plus ouverts au monde extérieur. Au Népal, de nombreux touristes sont venus dans le bidonville pour voir les fresques de plus près. En Indonésie et au Kenya, les habitants des quartiers plus riches sont venus pour y voir nos peintures. Les habitants ont pu échanger, parfois pour la première fois, avec des gens de l'extérieur.</p>
<p>Nous pensons que ce type d'échanges est un petit pas vers une société plus égalitaire. Nous pensons qu'attirer l'attention sur un quartier défavorisé au travers de l'art peut changer la façon dont ces communautés sont perçues.</p>

What we doWe are Seb Toussaint, and Spag, two artists from the UK and France, and together we make up the Outsiders Krew. We do street art, photography and film, and at the moment we're using these art-forms in an on-going art project called “Share The Word”. The idea is simple : we ask people who live in slums to give us words that we then turn into street art. Each family gives us one word that they want to share with the outside world, and we then paint this word on their house. In this project we use graffiti to bring the focus on a specific community through its own words. The art is the result of an interaction between us and the environment, and it becomes a bridge between the community and the outside world. Involving the local children and getting them to help us is always a priority, especially in places where not all children go to school and where art education is non-existent.From our experience, slums are vibrant places full of interesting and creative people. Unfortunately they are cut off from the rest of society, ignored or forgotten by many governments. If we want to build a more equal world, we need to include these communities, interact with them, and learn from them. Our photography and film work aim not only to showcase our street art, but to bring attention to these often ignored communities.After having taken Share The Word project to low income neighbourhoods of Indonesia, Kenya and Nepal, we now want to take the project to Colombia. In August 2014, we will spend 5 weeks in a slum of Bogota, painting street art on people's houses, and getting the kids involved in the project.How you can helpYou can help us by sending some money that will be used for the project in Colombia to pay for transport, paint, food and accommodation. Outsiders Krew is a non profit association, registered in the Prefecture du Calvados, in France. We're a very small organisation made up of simply us two artists doing things on our own, on a low budget. We financed the first 3 episodes of this project ourselves with our own savings, but after such successful episodes, we want to continue doing this and visit more slums!To participate you can choose a perk from 3€ to 500€ (on the right hand side). You can also donate any amount, click contribute, enter how much you want to donate and choose ""no contribution"".
After 3 episodes of Share The Word project, we are able to have a clear view of how much money is needed on this type of project.
This is what our budget looks like for 5 weeks in Bogota :
--
Flights : 1700 €
Paint and art supplies : 950 €
Food and daily expenses: 500 €
Accommodation : 180 €
Transport in Bogota : 70 €
Crowd funding and banking fees : 100 €
Total : 3500 €


How we make an impact
A typical day on a Share The Word project starts with us going to the slum looking for a nice wall to paint. When we've found one, we ask the family whose wall it is, to give a word that they would like to share. It may be in any language or script. As soon as they give us the word, we start painting, using spray paint, rollers, paint brushes or whatever we can get our hands on. The mural is improvised, inspired by the place, the people and the meaning of the word itself.
The first 3 episodes of Share The Word project in Indonesia, Kenya and Nepal were very successful. The locals welcomed the project and were very enthusiastic.

</p><p>Hello. I am Vedat Örs. I am a
painter. I invite you to help us build an art location, Village of
Art in Bodrum situated
on a beautiful peninsula on the Aegean sea of Turkey. It will be home particularly to the public of all
backgrounds and mediums for social gathering, conversation, artistic
experimentation, and holiday.</p>
<p>As a piece of Bodrum’s cultural
infrastructure, Village of Art will be home also to artists, sculptors,
cinematograhers, photographers, producers, directors, musicians, illustrators,
dancers, inventors, writers, performers, editors, designers, performers and
more of all art disciplines.</p>
<p>There will be art, painting,
sculpture, ceramics workshops in the Village of Art that we intend
to build. At the same time there will be a number of workshops on the visual arts. We aim to help both Turkish young artists and foreign artists to assemble in a functional space to have information and cultural exchange with each other. All people who do not have even any
background in art issues will be
able to participate in our
workshops and programs. They will
get an opportunity both to meet artists in the workshops but also have leisure
time activities on this favourite holiday peninsula.</p><p></p><p><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); line-height: 30px; letter-spacing: 0.06em; font-size: 24px;""><b>What We Need &amp; What You Get</b></span><br/></p><p></p><p>We want an arts commuity to
operate efficiently and produce work freely. The total cost of construction and
improvements of the location of our Village of Art is 30,000 USD. Your
contributions will not only provide the support necessary to develop this work,
they will help make the creation of a public place happen. </p>
<p>Indeed contributing to our
campaign is a way to support art in a very direct way, by bringing people all
over the world and artists together in this lively holiday location where new
works can be conceived and produced on a daily basis. Participants will
accomodate in tents and bungalows in the Village of Art and enjoy having a nice
stay in this lively holiday resort. They will experience the peninsula to truly
understand the attraction of Bodrum.</p>
<p>The town's charm is well-known, attracting a diverse
population of vacationers. Not far from town, you can swim in absolutely clear,
tideless, warm seas. The evenings in Bodrum are for sitting idly in one of the
manyrestaurants, dining on fresh seafood and other
Aegean specialties. Afterwards night clubs with live music and, of course, some
of thebest discosin
Europe keep you going until dawn.</p>
<p>Every dolar raised through
Indiegogo will go directly to the technical and creative design for the
project. If we
do not reach our goal, our location can still be constructed with the money
contributed, supplemented by sponsor participation. If you participate in our
campaign, you will still receive all the benefits. We offer you not only a nice holiday on the peninsula thanks to its
charming landscape and cultural sphere but also an experience to participate in all art workshops. </p>
<p>Please spread the word about
our Village of Art by using the Indiegogo share tools. Share this link with
your friends, your family and your neighbours. The location opening will be open to the
public on July 1, 2014. We would like to see you there.</p>
<p>Thank you for supporting our
project – Each and every contribution will make it happen!</p>

<p></p></div>","Short Summary
Hello. I am Vedat Örs. I am a
painter. I invite you to help us build an art location, Village of
Art in Bodrum situated
on a beautiful peninsula on the Aegean sea of Turkey. It will be home particularly to the public of all
backgrounds and mediums for social gathering, conversation, artistic
experimentation, and holiday.
As a piece of Bodrum’s cultural
infrastructure, Village of Art will be home also to artists, sculptors,
cinematograhers, photographers, producers, directors, musicians, illustrators,
dancers, inventors, writers, performers, editors, designers, performers and
more of all art disciplines.
There will be art, painting,
sculpture, ceramics workshops in the Village of Art that we intend
to build. At the same time there will be a number of workshops on the visual arts. We aim to help both Turkish young artists and foreign artists to assemble in a functional space to have information and cultural exchange with each other. All people who do not have even any
background in art issues will be
able to participate in our
workshops and programs. They will
get an opportunity both to meet artists in the workshops but also have leisure
time activities on this favourite holiday peninsula.What We Need & What You GetWe want an arts commuity to
operate efficiently and produce work freely. The total cost of construction and
improvements of the location of our Village of Art is 30,000 USD. Your
contributions will not only provide the support necessary to develop this work,
they will help make the creation of a public place happen. 
Indeed contributing to our
campaign is a way to support art in a very direct way, by bringing people all
over the world and artists together in this lively holiday location where new
works can be conceived and produced on a daily basis. Participants will
accomodate in tents and bungalows in the Village of Art and enjoy having a nice
stay in this lively holiday resort. They will experience the peninsula to truly
understand the attraction of Bodrum.
The town's charm is well-known, attracting a diverse
population of vacationers. Not far from town, you can swim in absolutely clear,
tideless, warm seas. The evenings in Bodrum are for sitting idly in one of the
manyrestaurants, dining on fresh seafood and other
Aegean specialties. Afterwards night clubs with live music and, of course, some
of thebest discosin
Europe keep you going until dawn.
Every dolar raised through
Indiegogo will go directly to the technical and creative design for the
project. If we
do not reach our goal, our location can still be constructed with the money
contributed, supplemented by sponsor participation. If you participate in our
campaign, you will still receive all the benefits. We offer you not only a nice holiday on the peninsula thanks to its
charming landscape and cultural sphere but also an experience to participate in all art workshops. 
Please spread the word about
our Village of Art by using the Indiegogo share tools. Share this link with
your friends, your family and your neighbours. The location opening will be open to the
public on July 1, 2014. We would like to see you there.
Thank you for supporting our
project – Each and every contribution will make it happen!

<i>Fellow friends of Lynn:  I have watched this drama unfold from afar, 
and neglected to act until now.  One of the kindest people I know has 
been struggling for two years due to some very unfair legal fees she has
 incurred (which most of you know about).  I feel badly that I have not 
done anything until now, but realize we're all very busy and it's easy 
to forget when your friend is so strong and capable despite all of the 
barriers she has faced.  Please consider buying her beautiful art for 
Halloween, Thanksgiving, Christmas, Hanukkah,  or any other occasion to 
help her bring down the burden of this heavy legal debt she's been 
unfairly saddled with.  As you undoubtedly know, Lynn is a hard worker 
and a true friend, and I'm saddened that she has suffered from this 
experience, and had over $10K in fees (now owing $6K).  As a single 
parent, this burden is enormous. Your help and support means the world.

<p>When Eleni came up with the idea to do this, I was skeptical at first,

really am in a time of need right now, and Eleni is the kind of person who makes things happen.  <br/></p>
<p>Two years ago, I incurred about $10,000 of legal fees for a situation
 that could have been handled without the use of attorneys or the court 
system. I will not go into the specifics of the case; those that know me
 know the story and know that it was completely unnecessary, and the end 
result was almost exactly the same as it was before the legal 
proceedings. What many may not know is what a huge financial strain this has been for me.</p>
<p>Just recently, there have been more 
unnecessary court proceedings caused by the same party. The time and 
energy put into this latest round caused me to miss a lot of work and 
added even more to my debt.<br/></p>
<p>I have managed to pay off almost half of the debt, but 
I have felt like an 
indentured servant for the last two years, giving every extra dime to either my lawyer or my credit card company every month. I am a single mom, working 
and providing for myself and my son without any financial assistance in the 
form of child support or aid from the state. We live very modestly and I very rarely buy anything for myself. It's been almost four years since I've seen my dad and some other family members because I have had no extra money to travel to the East Coast.<br/></p>
<p>The amount I still owe is about
 $6,000. I was able to get a low-interest-rate loan from my 
bank for the $3,000 that was on my credit card; the other $3,000 I owe directly to my attorney. <br/></p>
<p>I am offering my artwork and professional editing services in exchange for your generosity, and every little bit helps. If we can reach our goal, it will help me get back on my feet and back to a fair playing field.  I deeply appreciate all the love and support! xoxo<br/></p> </div> <div>

Sarah has spent more than 20 years mastering the art and meaning of the Yantras. Yantras are geometric colored images, depicting planets and deities featured in the Oracle Deck. Yantras were revealed in Northern India around 1,000 B.C., through the great scriptures. They help you harness your intuition and offer insight and understanding around aspects of your life and place in the Universe, from the mundane to the profane.How Sarah discovered Yantras: Sarah met her teacher Harish Johari, in New York and subsequently went to India to study with him.

<p>Hello FRIENDS AND FAMILY!</p>
<p>As many of you know, we are producing a short film, called ""The Calendar,"" set to shoot in August. Right now, we are in the tail-end of our fundraising, and we need your help!</p>
</div><div>

<h3>EL IMPACTO!</h3>
<p>The backbone of any film is the story, and we believe very strongly in ours. </p>
<p>The story involves a veteran who's dealing with a mental illness after returning from deployment, and a woman, seemingly a mere acquaintance, who is struggling with her need to ""save"" him.  </p>
<p>We are approaching this story in a honest, somewhat blunt style, and in that aesthetic, we will explore these two character's journeys as authentically as we can.</p>
<p>We are proud to have created a female protagonist who is human and real and well-rounded! And we are proud to have created a character who's a veteran, and yet void of the usual Hollywood cliches.</p>
<p>In terms of casting, we're committed to diversity. The story takes place in New York, and New York is incredibly diverse. Our actors should reflect their location. <br/></p>
<p>Ellyn Long Marshall, a respected casting director, shares our sentiment about casting. She loved our script, and has signed on to be our casting director! Her casting credits
 include the independent hits, ""Maria Full of Grace,"" starring Catalina

<p>As you can see, every step of the way, from writing to casting to shooting, we want to make our choices reflect the heart of the story we've created. And we think that goal is often lacking in the filmmaking industry.<br/></p>
<p></p>

<p>Now let's get down to business. With your help, we hope to raise $3950, which we will spend on the following important aspects of our production:</p>
<p>1) FOOD! (Craft Services &amp; Catering)<br/>-
 We have a 15 person crew, who will be shooting in the summer and 
working long hours. We want to make sure there is an abundance of water,
 coffee, snacks as well as hearty meals for the cast and crew. It's our 
responsibility to afford this basic, yet crucial, aspect of the 
filmmaking process.  </p>
<p>2) SOUND! (Sound Mixing)<br/>-One of the 
dead-giveaways of an amateur film is poor sound 
quality. Who wants to watch a beautiful film, if it's a strain to listen
 to?  We want to invest in a professional, highly skilled, sound mixer and
 boom operator, because skimping on sound is never a good idea.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>EL SECRETO!</h3>
<p>This campaign is to be semi-private, which means we're only sending it to friends, family and people who are involved in the project. I know this choice seems totally counter-intuitive, since we're trying to raise money. But the reason is that we will be promoting another campaign AFTER we're done shooting, which we'll hype-up like there's no tomorrow. This  second campaign will help us raise funds for our post-production costs, which involve editing, color grading, ADR, etc.<br/></p>
<p>So AFTER we shoot is actually the time when we will reach out to everybody and their mama. It'll be a much better time to crowdfund to the general public, since we'll have a full cast and crew, as well as photos from the set, and even a trailer.</p>

<p><b style=""line-height: 1.45em; font-size: 15px; font-weight: bold;"">My
name is Dennis Krupinski. I am a Husband, Father, Grandfather and Photographer.
Until recently, I had a nearly 25 year career that ended earlier than expected with my
diagnosis of Early-onset Alzheimer’s last year, before my 55th birthday.</b><span style=""line-height: 1.45em; font-size: 15px;"">
Unfortunately, I am not a stranger to this debilitating disease, having watched
both my grandfather and my mother deteriorate and inevitably pass away from
Alzheimer's. I have no illusions about my future unless better treatment or a
cure is found. I need your Help.</span></p>
<p></p>
<p>Over
the course of my 55 years, I’ve captured many of my most treasured memories on
film. As a professional photographer, it is my nature to see the world through
my lens and record the beauty and wonder I’ve experienced in my life.
However, until my recent diagnosis of Early-onset Alzheimer’s disease. I did not realize how important my
photography would become and how lucky I am to have actually documented my
memories.</p>
<p>As
a freelance photographer, it has always been a dream of mine to showcase my
work in a gallery event. NOW, I have the opportunity; as well as the chance to
build awareness of Alzheimer's disease and raise money for research to find a
cure. I will be showcasing some of my most inspiring photography at the Early Memories
Art Exhibition as a collaboration between the Alzheimer's Association Florida
Gulf Coast Chapter and the Arts Ensemble International's Healing Arts program.
Hopefully, with your financial support, my work will be on display for
approximately one month beginning Nov. 7, 2013 in the Arts Ensemble gallery
in Winter Haven, Fla.</p>

<h2><b>My Campaign Snapshot</b></h2>
<ul>
<li><b>Help make my dream a reality! I
     am asking for contributions to pay for printing, matting and framing of a
     unique selection of 16-20 of my photographs to be on display at
     the Early Memories Art Show on Nov. 7, 2013.</b></li>
<li>As a perk to those who support
     my campaign, I'd be honored to share my love of photography with you by
     sending you a sampling of my photo cards, or a limited edition print from
     this special exhibition gallery, depending on your contribution level.</li>
<li>If I do not reach my
     fundraising goal, I will use the funds raised to showcase as many
     photographs as possible at the show. The importance of this gallery
     exhibition is beyond my own desire for a gallery showing. It is raising
     the awareness for those living with Alzheimer's and will help support the
     efforts of the Alzheimer's Association and the Arts Ensemble Education
     Foundation, so they can continue to do this important work in our
     community.</li>

<h2><b>The Picture-Perfect Impact</b></h2>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em; font-size: 15px;"">After my diagnosis with Early-onset Alzheimer's, I realized that there is insufficient funding

     5.2 Million Americans.</span></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em; font-size: 15px;"">Therefore, in addition to being
     an advocate for people living with Alzheimer's,<b> I will also donate a

Memories


My
name is Dennis Krupinski. I am a Husband, Father, Grandfather and Photographer.
Until recently, I had a nearly 25 year career that ended earlier than expected with my
diagnosis of Early-onset Alzheimer’s last year, before my 55th birthday.
Unfortunately, I am not a stranger to this debilitating disease, having watched
both my grandfather and my mother deteriorate and inevitably pass away from
Alzheimer's. I have no illusions about my future unless better treatment or a
cure is found. I need your Help.

Over
the course of my 55 years, I’ve captured many of my most treasured memories on
film. As a professional photographer, it is my nature to see the world through
my lens and record the beauty and wonder I’ve experienced in my life.
However, until my recent diagnosis of Early-onset Alzheimer’s disease. I did not realize how important my
photography would become and how lucky I am to have actually documented my
memories.
As
a freelance photographer, it has always been a dream of mine to showcase my
work in a gallery event. NOW, I have the opportunity; as well as the chance to
build awareness of Alzheimer's disease and raise money for research to find a
cure. I will be showcasing some of my most inspiring photography at the Early Memories
Art Exhibition as a collaboration between the Alzheimer's Association Florida
Gulf Coast Chapter and the Arts Ensemble International's Healing Arts program.
Hopefully, with your financial support, my work will be on display for
approximately one month beginning Nov. 7, 2013 in the Arts Ensemble gallery
in Winter Haven, Fla.



My Campaign Snapshot

Help make my dream a reality! I
     am asking for contributions to pay for printing, matting and framing of a
     unique selection of 16-20 of my photographs to be on display at
     the Early Memories Art Show on Nov. 7, 2013.
As a perk to those who support
     my campaign, I'd be honored to share my love of photography with you by
     sending you a sampling of my photo cards, or a limited edition print from
     this special exhibition gallery, depending on your contribution level.
If I do not reach my
     fundraising goal, I will use the funds raised to showcase as many
     photographs as possible at the show. The importance of this gallery
     exhibition is beyond my own desire for a gallery showing. It is raising
     the awareness for those living with Alzheimer's and will help support the
     efforts of the Alzheimer's Association and the Arts Ensemble Education
     Foundation, so they can continue to do this important work in our
     community.




The Picture-Perfect Impact
After my diagnosis with Early-onset Alzheimer's, I realized that there is insufficient funding
     dedicated to finding a cure for a disease that currently affects more than
     5.2 Million Americans.
Therefore, in addition to being
     an advocate for people living with Alzheimer's, I will also donate a
     portion of the funds raised from any sales of my photography during the
     show to these important nonprofit organizations - Alzheimer's Association and Arts Ensemble Education Foundation and Healing Arts Center.



Ways You Can Help

Donate! Any contribution is
     appreciated! $10, $20, $50, $100 - whatever you can do. I thank you for
     your support in advance. 

Spread the word! Share this on
     your Facebook page, Twitter, etc. or email your friends and family. Any
     support is greatly appreciated and the chances are that you have known, do know or will know
     one of 5.2 million Americans living with this disease every day, or the
     millions more who will face it in the future.

<h3>What is The Red Museum?</h3>
<p>The Red Museum is an old fruit-packing warehouse on the outskirts of Mansion Flats that has transformed into an epicenter of experimentation and raw arts culture in Sacramento. We provide affordable practice/studio space to local creatives and occasionally host highly-curated events that bring people of different ages, ethnicities, genders, economic backgrounds, and tastes together to experience new music, performance, food, and visual art for a reasonable entry price. We believe in the cultural value of providing exposure for emerging artists and we never want money to be a barrier between a good artist and a successful artist. We also want the public, no matter their demographic, to have access to this culture through our events.</p>
<h3>Why do we need help?</h3>
<p>Here’s the wrinkle in all that. First, earlier this summer, the City paid us a visit and gave us a list of upgrades to complete to help us become safer and code compliant. Secondly, we want to be able to publicize and promote our arts events to reach a wider audience. We have had a lot of support getting this started, but we need more help. That’s where you come in!</p>
<h3>What are we offering?</h3>
<p>We’re kicking this off with Red Ex: Vol 1, a mini festival on August 26<sup>th</sup> at The Red Museum. We wanted an event that felt very unified in vision but also represented the diversity of the current up-and-coming talent in our city. We didn’t book anything just to sell tickets – these are all people that we really believe are of high artistic merit and quality. We are also very dedicated to crossing over between often siloed art scenes – music, art, comedy, food – because we think that audiences appreciate being stimulated in different ways at one event. Sacramento has a warm community of artists and art supporters who are open to experiencing new things, making our city a really unique incubator for creativity.</p>
<h3>How will we know if we succeed?</h3>
<p>The success of this project will demonstrate that there is a path to helping art spaces survive in a changing and gentrifying city. By galvanizing support from city leadership, local businesses, and the community, we can ensure that the future of the arts is secure here in Sacramento. We’ve decided to make the Red Ex tickets the foundation of this campaign and have added other special perks from there. We appreciate any support and hope we will see you soon at The Red Museum!</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>My name is Samantha Cornwell-Crabtree, also known as Samantha CC. I'm a performance artist, filmmaker and curator from Brooklyn, NY. Although my background is in film, my art practice has been focused on performance in the last year or so. Through the New York performance community I've had the opportunity to connect with a number of other artists from the African diaspora who are doing beautiful, exciting work. Meeting all of these amazing people inspired me to start an ongoing curatorial project called The Great BE, or the great Black Expanse. I wanted to create community and exhibition opportunities amongst black artists, whether or not their work dealt directly with the black experience or not. The theme of the first show and zine was ""survival"" but this time we are focusing on ""Abundance.""</p>
<p>Speaking of abundance, in the time since our last show, it has become very clear that in order for the project to grow, and for artists to feel like The Great BE is a space that allows for the development of ambitious new work, I must find a way to compensate artists for their participation. Many of the artists who are, or have been involved in this project have to work several jobs to stay afloat, and in some cases have to miss a shift of paid work in order to participate in events such as this. Even performances that might seem ephemeral or effortless usually require a considerable period of rehearsal and conceptual development. Often artists have to rent space in order to have enough room to practice movement based work. With the state of the world being what it is, black artists are more likely to not have a parent or other family member who can loan them money to allow them  to focus on their art. A recent study found <b>80%</b> of artists who have New York gallery representation are white. On a similar note, a 2015 study found that only <b>7%</b> of people making a living off of their art in New York were of African descent. Those of us who become artists understand that we shouldn't be expecting a huge pay day, but artists shouldn't feel like they constantly have to choose between making work and surviving. Your contributions will help these artists feel like they can invest quality time and effort in their projects without it depleting their resources </p>

</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The primary goal of this campaign is to raise money to pay the artists. Although the artists will get a percentage of the money collected through ticket sales, we are also donating 10% of that to the National Association of Black Farmers, and since the venue's capacity is only 80, the amount we earn alone might not be enough to pay all the artists sufficiently.</p>
<p>On top of that, there are other expenses that we need to cover in order to make this event a memorable one. Since performance is so ephemeral, documentation is crucial. We need a budget in order to hire talented photographers and videographers to capture the events of the night. We also need budget to print items such as programs (complimentary) and posters (available for sale at the event and as a perk here.) At the last event I provided complimentary snacks for guests, and I'd like to have some money to do the same this time around.</p>
<p>We have a great collection of perks that come deep from the heart of the project. They include copies of our last zine, a chance to pre order the next zine, a video of the show, posters, exclusive performances and more!</p>
<p>In general, you get a chance to support the work of a group of very talented young artists who offer unique and beautiful visions of reality.</p>

And a somewhat milder life in Hungary and Poland. And at the same time I was visiting the West, and took pictures of western people in the exact same way as I did in the East. Western Europe wasn’t paradise for me, I was there to see the lonely, the elderly or the poor, most of the time. I soon realized that I wasn’t into “photojournalism”; I was unable to document reality. The only subjects I was really interested in were the human faces I could see in the streets, and the human condition, maybe.</p><p>And then, in 1989, the Wall collapsed, suddenly, without asking me whether I had completed the project or not... And my grandiose plan, a Europe with no walls, unified through photography, seemed more stupid than ever... So, I wondered what the heck I was doing all those years, what the point of all this was. The decompression was so abrupt. But I was in Berlin that cold November night and I lived the most exciting moments of my life, everybody there felt that way, we were living History, Freedom. Europe was changing before our eyes, walls were falling, it was magic. </p><p>When all came to pass, I had to go back home, with no other plans and terribly disappointed. What I had in hand was of no value in my eyes. It wasn't “documentation”, photojournalism, it wasn't “art” either (“art photography” was something I couldn’t even stand). I felt that my work had no place anywhere. I had done something very personal and old-fashioned because that was me. And I didn't want to make a career on that, I had no motivation anymore. So, I buried the negatives away in a storage room and forgot them completely. And with them I buried that part of my life. I had family and a job to feed my family and I was happy with my new life, never missed the old days, never said anything and never showed the photos to anybody, not even my wife.

And every winter I would return home to develop the films and work, waiting until springtime to take off again.Paris, France, 1985I visited Eastern Europe and I saw the misery in Romania, the oppression and fear in the eyes of people in East Germany and Czechoslovakia. And a somewhat milder life in Hungary and Poland. And at the same time I was visiting the West, and took pictures of western people in the exact same way as I did in the East. Western Europe wasn’t paradise for me, I was there to see the lonely, the elderly or the poor, most of the time. I soon realized that I wasn’t into “photojournalism”; I was unable to document reality. The only subjects I was really interested in were the human faces I could see in the streets, and the human condition, maybe.And then, in 1989, the Wall collapsed, suddenly, without asking me whether I had completed the project or not... And my grandiose plan, a Europe with no walls, unified through photography, seemed more stupid than ever... So, I wondered what the heck I was doing all those years, what the point of all this was. The decompression was so abrupt. But I was in Berlin that cold November night and I lived the most exciting moments of my life, everybody there felt that way, we were living History, Freedom. Europe was changing before our eyes, walls were falling, it was magic. When all came to pass, I had to go back home, with no other plans and terribly disappointed. What I had in hand was of no value in my eyes. It wasn't “documentation”, photojournalism, it wasn't “art” either (“art photography” was something I couldn’t even stand). I felt that my work had no place anywhere. I had done something very personal and old-fashioned because that was me. And I didn't want to make a career on that, I had no motivation anymore. So, I buried the negatives away in a storage room and forgot them completely. And with them I buried that part of my life. I had family and a job to feed my family and I was happy with my new life, never missed the old days, never said anything and never showed the photos to anybody, not even my wife. I had totally forgotten my past and my photos, for 25 years.Budapest, Hungary, 1986And then, in March 2014, I found the old Minox in a drawer –all photos were shot with this little marvel. I remembered what I had done with it and found the negatives, in good condition. I scanned a few frames and uploaded them in Facebook. To my great surprise, they were a success with my friends there, and it was a big surprise for me because –I mean it– I’d never thought that anyone would be interested in my work. And then I uploaded more and more. I thought then that these human faces I saw in the streets of Europe in the 80s should not disappear with me, that they could live in a book. I made a first selection of 95 photos from the archive -et voilà! Here is the book, dedicated to my Facebook friends, to whom I owe everything.""Benaki Museum link about the event.The detailed budget of the exhibition is here.More information about me and my project is on my site.

<p>Hi! My name is Mara Jayne and I'm a young artist from Rhode Island. For
the past few years I have been delicately balancing my college education and my
job as a nursing assistant while selling my artwork at conventions and doing
freelance illustration. <span>Going to conventions, meeting people, selling
my artwork, and learning how to be better at what I do brings meaning to my
life.</span></p>
<p>Up until now the types of merchandise I've been able
to supply at conventions has been limited to art prints, key chains, bookmarks,
etc. In my spare time I've begun creating a series of illustrations aiming at
expanding my artistic production, and am organizing something I have never
attempted before: a book.<span>  <br/></span></p><p><span><br/></span></p>

<p>The Video Game Pin-Up book is a publication comprised of 16 diverse and
tantalizing pin-up style illustrations, each featuring a character from one of
the most well-loved video game franchises of the decade. These art pieces are
tasteful, sensual arrangements that celebrate the uniqueness of each individual
character. These illustrations focus on highlighting all the things that make
each subject uniquely sexy, including their sense of humor, physical features,
and more. </p>
<p>The portability a book offers is unparalleled in other
forms of artistic printing in terms of longevity, tangibility and quality. As
an artist, I
want to produce the best possible caliber of work in the most substantial
format possible. Prints are great, but books give me the freedom to offer

We want to be able to produce a unique invitation, and an exhibition catalog that people will remember, keep and treasure. We ask for your kind support and donations, in order to create an exhibition catalog, something our course has never done due to funding.With your help, we will create an degree show at Free Range London, that will showcase our talent, and help us create our own identity in the world, after graduating. We appreciate all your help. No donation is too small. If you cannot afford to donate, you can still support us by sharing our page with your friends and family. WHAT DO YOU GET OUT OF THIS?We need to raise at least £500 for the printing of invitations and exhibition catalogues. These catalogues will tell people about our exhibition, our artwork, and us as people. You can support us by donating as little as £1. from as little as £5, you can receive a little gift from us to thank you for your support. For your kind donations, you could receive an invitation to the private view of our exhibition at Free Range in London, a poster/print, and a credit in the exhibition catalogue.Thank you for taking the time to support us. Please donate, share our page, and we look forward to seeing you at our exhibition!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h4><b><br/>What are we doing?</b></h4>
<p>We are fundraising for two sets of workshops in Africa and one in New York City.</p>
<p>The <b>first workshop</b> will take place in Namibia and New York City.  The first workshop focuses on art/photography with school-aged girls, helping promote self-esteem and empowerment. These girls will learn photography skills and experiment with mixed media, ultimately creating their own ""visual story"". Through the use of photography and art, they will experience accomplishment, empowerment, and increased self-esteem. Pieces from this workshop will be on gallery display in New York City.</p>
<p>The <b>second</b><b> workshop</b> will take place at NaDEET in Namibia. We will be teaching Environment Art Making which is the practice of creating art from materials found in the direct environment, in a way that balances environmental stewardship, community development while promoting economic viability.The culmination of the workshop will create a sustainable 3 dimensional art piece created from repurposed materials through the collaboration of several workshops of school age children who attend NaDEETs program.</p>
<p>Sustainable art making recognizes the connection between environmental health, human health and community health.</p>
<p></p>
<h4><b>Why is it so important?</b></h4>
<p>It is quite important to help foster creativity to promote self esteem in effort to prevent real world issues that our youth face today, especially in the developing world (as well as inner city's in America) such as AIDS/HIV, teen pregnancy, school drop outs, alcohol/drug abuse, depression and poverty. We have a responsibility to invest in the children of today to help build a better tomorrow. Sustainable art making recognizes the connection between environmental health, human health and community health</p>
<h4><b>Who are we? </b></h4>
<p>We are a group of seasoned, like minded art therapists from New York City that have a vision of creating art and photography workshops around the world for underserved children to help build self esteem and empower the youth of today! </p>
<h4><b>How are we are qualified to do this?</b></h4>
<p>Between the 3 of us we have several years experience working with children and adults in such settings as inner city schools, hospital schools, after school programming for at risk youth, residential treatment facilities, nursing homes, prisons, homeless shelters and public and private psychiatric hospitals in and around New York City. </p>
<h4><b>Why do art with kids? </b></h4>
<p>We believe, that giving a child the chance to be creative in a supportive environment yield many positive results such as learned basic art and photography techniques, help build self esteem and allow the playfulness of childhood thrive. </p>

<p>Travel costs to Namibia (air and ground transportation)</p>
<p>Overhead costs</p>
<p>If we reach our goal, we will be able to fund the program for approximately 3 months. With more funding, we can continue longer! </p>
<h4><b>Why We Can Succeed! </b></h4>
<p>In 2009, Cheryl and her partner Christi traveled to Namibia and created a pilot program through a collaboration with NaDEET (Namib Desert Environmental Education Trust)</p>
<p>Using art with several groups of children over a span of 2 months, we saw first hand how powerful art can be! NaDEET reaches most of the children of Namibia despite their socio economic status. This gave us the platform to work with everyone! We also provided professional development trainings to the educators and administration as well a created a mural for the camp. </p>
<p>We also learned that building alliances with already established programs like NaDEET, opens the door to beautiful collaborations that can have a lasting effect and reach many different people. For this reason, we have opened up to other organizations around the world that have welcomed our collaborative efforts but with this comes our need to be self funded (that's where you come in, see?)</p>

UPDATE (2/10):A More Recent HistoryThe installation was put up last year on a hill below the Forest Lawn Cemetery.  Some of you caught sight of it, but it was quickly taken down.  If big government doesn't work, someone should tell CalTrans. The sign was redesigned, twice as big, and relocated to a hill overlooking the local park: Glassell Park. It was visible from the baseball diamond, the swimming pool, and the 2 freeway.  Although great advertisement for the vacant property, the sign was not authorized by the owner and was eventually removed.Good News!The installation will go back up!  I have located property close to the prior location with owners who have authorized placement of the sign.  Should this campaign fall short, I have contacted locals who are willing to help cobble something together that looks like letters and put it on a hill in a legible fashion.  I encourage you to donate to the effort, however.

I need the creativity and the dialogue with different kind of material. I love round and oscillated profiles, even and textured facing. My sculptures are made out of natural stone or wooden and they are made to be touched. Art means to me creation out of an idea, somehow unique with an unreproducible effect.<br/></p>

<h2>7. How was the idea born?</h2>

A friend of mine and I were sitting in the sun watching men pass by, pondering on whom of the passersby we would like to paint.<br/><br/>We had a ball.<br/><br/>Soon we discussed our favourite male nudes in the art. And realized, each single one of them was painted by a man. <br/><br/>This realization shocked me, so one day I sat down and started researching a bit.<br/><br/>The result made me sad. There are hardly any painted men. And if you finally find one, he has almost always been painted by a man.<br/><br/>I googled, and googled and googled. Try for yourself. Male nudes, nudes in the art.... I tried it from a different angle by googling images of contemporary female artists, country by country:<br/><b><br/>and what did I get as a result? Naked women. Or men painted by men. It seems that hardly any contemporary female artists paint or sculpture men.</b>
<p><br/></p>
<p>The search was and is very time consuming and at the same time fascinating. To
 me it seemed, and this is my personal impression, you might not agree 
with, that we women are still very much concentrating on the body we can
 offer to our lover, on the body we think will excite or repulse men.
</p>
<p>I feel the time is ripe to celebrate our lovers. To 
eternalize them. To show to the world, what we consider attractive, 
repulsive, pulsating.</p>
<span><b>Where are the contemporary female artists who paint men? Lovers? </b></span>
<p>When I continued researching out of curiosity, I
 stumbled across some very interesting art, great artists, but my initial impressioned deepened. Men in contemporary art are pretty very much hidden, difficult to 
find. <br/></p>
<p><b>I caught fire! I realized that if I want to change that, I cannot do it alone. I need to spread the spark, to invite artists from around the world to participate. And at the same time create a platform, on which we can then present what we create. <br/></b></p>
<b>The idea of the blog/book ""99 lovers from around the world"" was born.</b>

<br/><p><b>Will the artists always be female?</b></p>
<p>I am already considering an edition by male artists of 99 Lovers from around the World. Or a totally mixed version.</p>
<p>And when cities participate in the ""99 lovers from 99 cities"" event, each city can choose the lovers they want to choose. </p>
<p><b>Why are there no perks for buying the book ""99 Lovers from around the world""?</b></p>
<p>The perks for buying a hardcopy of ""99 Lovers from around the world"" will be made available as soon as sufficient funds have been collected in order to layout and print the book.</p>

""A giant""

   


Ioana Niculescu-Aron, Romania
I am an art addict. I am young. I am vibrant. I am beautiful. I want to understand who I am. Who the others are. What life is all about. Painting, I find myself. Painting, I explore myself. Painting, I guess the essence of the other. Painting, I capture the essence of the other. Like I imagine a blind person slowly discovering other humans, I discover the world by painting and in sculptures. I paint. Fullstop. I am a visionary. Through my nature I love living, exploring life and then give life by coloring canvases, walls, gesso, and everything else stays in front of me. I am strong, I know this.. and even so, there is someone warmer than me – someone with huge hands and land body: a giant. A dear friend of mine calls me Solaris. Stay tuned. Follow my journey. Apart from painting the giant of course.




""My secret, cherished""



Mandy Racine, Mallorca


My paintings and drawings of male nudes are inspired by the power and movement of the male body. I explore a variety of techniques to try and capture a moment, when it's moving from one place to another. Plaster, charcoal, paint & varnish, sometimes with traces of writing are applied in a very spontaneous way and often reworked several times. Sources of inspiration are often classical subjects which I put a contemporary twist to.  



""Watchman""





Sylvia Itzen, Germany
Freelancer performer, born 1968. Since 1989 I`m working in a small village closed to Hamburg and internationally. Why do I produce art? It´s a passion and I have to do it! I need the creativity and the dialogue with different kind of material. I love round and oscillated profiles, even and textured facing. My sculptures are made out of natural stone or wooden and they are made to be touched. Art means to me creation out of an idea, somehow unique with an unreproducible effect.



""Li""


Jade, Australia
I am having a ball with the art, and am delighted to report that I'm getting commissions. But it's all about the sheer fun of it, being able to create the kind of work I always dreamed of, back in the days when I had the vision but no way to get that vision out of my head and onto canvas. I just glimpsed something new, as I typed those words, and I'll be busy with it it five more minutes!


""Bliss""




Muni, Switzerland
When I have a creative thrust, there is no holding me back. My visions are powerful. 
I did not plan 99 lovers. 
99 lovers chose me to bring them into life, into your perception. With your support, we can make it!







5. Celebrating your Support





6. Project-Plan






7. How was the idea born?

A friend of mine and I were sitting in the sun watching men pass by, pondering on whom of the passersby we would like to paint.We had a ball.Soon we discussed our favourite male nudes in the art. And realized, each single one of them was painted by a man. This realization shocked me, so one day I sat down and started researching a bit.The result made me sad. There are hardly any painted men. And if you finally find one, he has almost always been painted by a man.I googled, and googled and googled. Try for yourself. Male nudes, nudes in the art.... I tried it from a different angle by googling images of contemporary female artists, country by country:and what did I get as a result? Naked women. Or men painted by men. It seems that hardly any contemporary female artists paint or sculpture men.

The search was and is very time consuming and at the same time fascinating. To
 me it seemed, and this is my personal impression, you might not agree 
with, that we women are still very much concentrating on the body we can
 offer to our lover, on the body we think will excite or repulse men.

I feel the time is ripe to celebrate our lovers. To 
eternalize them. To show to the world, what we consider attractive, 
repulsive, pulsating.
Where are the contemporary female artists who paint men? Lovers? 
When I continued researching out of curiosity, I
 stumbled across some very interesting art, great artists, but my initial impressioned deepened. Men in contemporary art are pretty very much hidden, difficult to 
find. 
I caught fire! I realized that if I want to change that, I cannot do it alone. I need to spread the spark, to invite artists from around the world to participate. And at the same time create a platform, on which we can then present what we create. 
The idea of the blog/book ""99 lovers from around the world"" was born.

9. FAQs
Will the artists always be female?
I am already considering an edition by male artists of 99 Lovers from around the World. Or a totally mixed version.
And when cities participate in the ""99 lovers from 99 cities"" event, each city can choose the lovers they want to choose. 
Why are there no perks for buying the book ""99 Lovers from around the world""?
The perks for buying a hardcopy of ""99 Lovers from around the world"" will be made available as soon as sufficient funds have been collected in order to layout and print the book.

Sleepy Robot 13 is a  handmade business started in late 2009 via Etsy. At the time I had just lost my job and was going through a deep postpartum depression after the birth of my 1st child. I started the company as a way to make a little money to keep my rent and bills paid while I looked for a new job.

Sleepy robots are tiny individually hand sculpted polymer clay robots that are full of personality, emotions and curiosity. 

What started out as a line of robot themed figurines and toys, quickly grew to include buttons, stickers, jewelry and more. 
Thanks to the success of Sleepy Robot 13' I was able to stop my job search and overcome my depression.

Between October 2009 and July 2011 I have created and sold more than 4,500 individually handmade pieces.

Sleepy Robots have been purchased as Christmas,birthday and wedding gifts. As well as mementos to inspire and support. Several bots have also made their way to soldiers in Iraq and Afghanistan.

 I have been told by many people that looking at one of my robots  brings a smile to their face. My response to that id ""If my art can my make at  least one person a day smile, I've done my job"".


The Impact


Funding would assist me in expanding my business to accept wholesale orders. As I am working alone from home at this time, I have had to turn down several lucrative wholesale orders and possible long term sales commitments. Additional space would allow me to bring in 2 or more interns/part time staff to assist in filling these orders and provide them with adequate work space.


In December of 2010 I was approached by a representative for Borders Inc. regarding supplying them with a considerable amount of my zombie robots to be sold in several of their retail stores. I was unable to accept the wholesale request. I could not create the the large quantity of robots and packing in the short amount of time the company needed them and keep up with my regular orders as well.

With the addition of at least 2 interns or part time employees many of the issues I struggled with above could be evenly handled by the 3 of us.


If my campaign is funded it will assist in creating:
-jobs and internships
-Awareness and support for small locally owned businesses
-Work shops and  Educationational opportunities for the community

This is a great opportunity to for me to offer art students in my community internships for class credit as well as useful experience running an art/craft business.

Eventually I would like to be able to offer workshops for children and adults interested in art, crafting and starting their own small arts based business.

 I have been very fortunate to be able to start my business with very little capital, but that is not the case with continuing to grow.

  In addition Sleepy Robot 13 will be able to move forward with new ventures and products including but not limited to:

<h3>The Impact</h3>

<p><span> In the next school year many institution across Alberta will be determining the best ways to generate funding to make up the deficit due to recent budget cuts. The Alberta College of Art and Design has already felt some of the repercussions the increased pressure to generate money has had on our school. Only weeks after the end of our school year, Gord Ferguson, one of the beloved members of our community was fired after allowing one of his students to do a subversive and evocative performance in our cafeteria. One of the official statements released about the situation explained the firing was due to the apparent defamation of the school and potential loss of prospective students. After an uproar from the artists community including demonstrations, petitions, and letters from respected teachers and students across the country, Gord Ferguson was reinstated. Any person involved in the art world knows that it is part of an artists role within society to push boundaries and make people re-assess the accepted norms of how we think and act. Suddenly being “popular” (a.k.a. in good standings with those who have a heavy pocket book) was becoming more important than freedom of expression.This entire situation puts into sharp focus how the power of money has direct influence over what type of environment we are subjected to and how decisions are made within our institution. Over the next year The Alberta College of Art and Design must raise $300,000 and if that money has to come from corporations we jeopardize the future of our school as we know it. After attending budget cut meetings it is clear that failure to raise enough funds will result in reduced hours of operation, cut staff, and shutting down entire programs. It is now up to the student body of ACAD to put together all our creative forces and appeal to our community to help us raise the money ourselves, therefore giving us a bigger voice and more control over what  decisions are being made about our future as an art school.</span></p>
<p><span>The official ACAD website reads:</span></p>
<p><span>""This is a time of dynamic growth for ACAD. We are carving out a new role as a leader in cultural development and cultural research.  We have adopted a new mandate and vision; we have established our Institute for the Creative Process</span><span>; and we have led public discourse on imagination, arts and community. This is also a time of unprecedented support for ACAD.  This allows us to achieve unprecedented excellence in our programs and practices which encourages others to add their support and help increase our momentum.""</span></p>
<span style=""font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;""><span><br/></span></span><span>If budget cuts or outside funding force us to reconfigure our values of being a leading centre for creativity and innovative thought, then the integrity of being an artist is at stake....By donating to The Art Kids Revenge you are showing support for your local Canadian up and coming artists. Your donation helps maintain the quality and variety of  instruction we receive which has developed artists who make important contributions to culture and innovation across the country. </span><br/><p> </p>
<p><span>The deficit is $300,000 and I have placed my goal for this portion of my fundraising at a third of this total. The failure or success of this campaign is not simply about numbers. Beyond the Indigogo campaign I have several other fund raising strategies in place over the summer, and hope to become a strong testament towards what one determined person can do. All the money donated will go towards a scholarship for the Alberta College of Art and Design. I will be appealing to the student body (my peers) to use the scholarship as an incentive to raise the same amount among themselves to put towards our deficit. By donating (any amount) you are giving direct support towards the contributions art makes to a healthy and diverse culture. By putting money in the hands of the student body we show our commitment to maintaing an artistic institution which is respondent to the needs of its students and not its payroll. </span></p>
<p><span>So this is it- the art kids revenge. We are lovers of the under ground, and naturally the under dogs. Theatre, dance, music, and fine arts always seem to be the first to be dismissed during budget cuts- but we still learn how to thrive. We use our passion and creative problem solving capacities to find new ways to succeed. With your help we can say ^%#$ the big corporations, @%^% the government- the only thing we need to support ourselves is to prove our passion, appeal to our community and silently exact the perfect Art Kids Revenge: Using our art to support our arts education - an energy flow that makes sense. </span></p>

<p>By contributing to this campaign, not only will you help fund these cute fruity pins but would also be aiding me in launching one of my dreams ♡ </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">☆ There are currently 8 designs available to unlock, but should this project be successful, I am excited to work on and add even <i><strong>more </strong></i>designs for you ☆</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1555513343/ycohuvfurhopqwu6h27l.png"" src=""""/></p>

<p>If you've never used Indiegogo before then thank you for allowing me to be your first!! Here's a brief introduction of how it works, much like Kickstarter, Indiegogo is a crowdfunding platform, however as opposed to Kickstarter operating in only a few countries, Indiegogo is available in a much wider range, including where I'm currently situated: Dubai. </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">☆ By choosing a perk, you will be both helping in the funding of the pins as well as pre-ordering the reward chosen, which means once the campaign ends and the pins have been manufactured, your items will be shipped out to <i><strong>you</strong></i>! ☆</p>
<p>Keep in mind, this is a fixed funding project, which means if the initial goal is not met, you will be refunded and I will not receive any of the funds. If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me ♡ </p>

</div><div>
<p>Once the campaign ends, I will be sending out a survey to all my backers via e-mail to fill, where you can choose which design you would like to order. 500$ is the minimum for any Indiegogo campaign which means the project will not go through / be funded, unless both the first two designs are unlocked. </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">☆ If you are backing this project, please make sure to occasionally check your e-mail for any updates and the survey ☆</p>

<p>Thank you so much to everyone who supports me and my art, I would not have the courage to pursue new concepts and goals had it not been for your support and encouragement! Any support, be it through backing the campaign or sharing the word through social media, means the world to me.</p>
<p>If you can spread the word and share this in any way — please do! </p>
<p>You all have my eternal gratitude and I hope we can run a successful project together! ♡</p>
</div></div>","Hello, I'm Dee, some of you know me as ddkinzart from social media, and I'm really excited to share this pin campaign with you— it has been one of my new year's resolutions to get into pin making and launch my own collection and this is my very first one!!
By contributing to this campaign, not only will you help fund these cute fruity pins but would also be aiding me in launching one of my dreams ♡ 
☆ There are currently 8 designs available to unlock, but should this project be successful, I am excited to work on and add even more designs for you ☆


If you've never used Indiegogo before then thank you for allowing me to be your first!! Here's a brief introduction of how it works, much like Kickstarter, Indiegogo is a crowdfunding platform, however as opposed to Kickstarter operating in only a few countries, Indiegogo is available in a much wider range, including where I'm currently situated: Dubai. 
☆ By choosing a perk, you will be both helping in the funding of the pins as well as pre-ordering the reward chosen, which means once the campaign ends and the pins have been manufactured, your items will be shipped out to you! ☆
Keep in mind, this is a fixed funding project, which means if the initial goal is not met, you will be refunded and I will not receive any of the funds. If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me ♡ 


Once the campaign ends, I will be sending out a survey to all my backers via e-mail to fill, where you can choose which design you would like to order. 500$ is the minimum for any Indiegogo campaign which means the project will not go through / be funded, unless both the first two designs are unlocked. 
☆ If you are backing this project, please make sure to occasionally check your e-mail for any updates and the survey ☆




75% Manufacturing
10% Shipping
5% Packaging
10% Indiegogo Fees

☆  Each design will cost approximately $250 to produce, these funds will go into manufacturing, the packaging ( backing cards ), indiegogo fees, shipping and a bit extra in case of any emergencies or unaccounted for expenses ☆ 

☆ Every pledge is set at a discounted pre-order price☆ Additional discounts are available for limited early bird orders☆ You can add a vinyl sticker to your perk for an additional $2 per sticker

☆ Fund Raising: Mid April - End of May☆ Indiegogo Review + Surveying: 2 weeks☆ Production ( 4 to 6 weeks ): May - June☆ Shipping ( 2 weeks ): June - July
This is a very rough estimate of the time line and should things run smoothly, you will have your pins in your hand by June, or July at most. All pins will be shipped via registered mail with a tracking number.

☆ I will always keep you updated on the progress / process of the campaign but keep in mind I have no control over things from the manufacturers side, nor if there any delays with the mail AFTER I send over the package from my side.
☆ Keep in mind the colors displayed are just a mock up, and colors vary from one screen to another, therefore, there might be very slight differences in the actual size and color of the product itself when produced.
☆ While I have worked on campaigns before, this is my first pin campaign and my first time manufacturing pins in such a large amount. I will work very hard to ensure things run smoothly, however should any errors occur during manufacturing or shipping or other unforeseen problems which could cause a slight delay in the timeline, backers will be notified immediately. 

Thank you so much to everyone who supports me and my art, I would not have the courage to pursue new concepts and goals had it not been for your support and encouragement! Any support, be it through backing the campaign or sharing the word through social media, means the world to me.
If you can spread the word and share this in any way — please do!

<p><span></span>Hi,
my name is Kerrie and ever since I was a little girl living in France with my
family, I’ve wanted to be an artist. All of my adult life, I’ve been
chipping away at HOW to make this dream my full-time occupation in realistic
ways, and still afford a roof over my head. <span>For
35 years, I’ve lived in the same PNW university community and raised my own
child </span>who is successfully chasing dreams of her own out in the world.  <br/></p>
<p></p>
<p>                                    <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/733646/files/20140721143555-my_child.png?1405978555"" src="""" style=""""/></p>While
the price for my current artist abode matches the local market average, it is
beyond reach for an independent artist to purchase alone. Now, I
have an opportunity to buy the duplex that I’ve lived in for the past 5 years,
a home to me that is perfectly situated within walking/biking distance to both
the university and the downtown art scene.<span></span>
<p><span></span>
That’s
where you come in- with the enthusiastic support of culture lovers of all
kinds, I can finally settle one of the biggest hurdles to my childhood dream: that of
having a permanent studio and home I can depend on, to ramp up my creative concentration
and output at long last. <br/></p>
<p>Oh, and buying this duplex provides a permanent home for one of my
muses, who loves his peaceful perches throughout the house.
</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/733691/files/20140721143939-Indiegogo-_bird_muse.png?1405978779"" src="""" style=""""/></p>What
your contribution helps me achieve is MAJOR stress relief at a critical
juncture between funding cycles on the community art project I am working on, and have been working on for three years now, as a recent university graduate in French.


<p>Home
ownership is potent- it changes brain chemistry. That kind of peace of mind finds its
way into my sense of confidence and wonderfully affects everything I see and do
as an artist. <br/></p>
<p>I am free to value everything more, and I am more freed up to focus
energy and attention on the current community art project I have been collaborating on with partners at the university and in the local community. A sophisticated
project that will add to the public's discovery of not only a precious cultural legacy, but to one's own knowledge of just how valuable one’s eyes,
perceptions and perspectives are. Yet, to move through this critical juncture in the community art project, I must stabilize my housing and studio
requirements so I am free to remain to concentrated on the necessary work over the next 12 months, in order to reach our goals of getting
the project in front of next level investors by this time next year.</p>
<br/><p></p> </div> <div>                                                                                        <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/733710/files/20140721144153-small.jpg?1405978913"" src="""" style=""width: 245.078px; height: 163px;""/><br/>The
duplex is on the market for $229k.                                                                                          I am asking you to help me raise $239k to achieve
full successful purchase, with just enough to cover the costs in the first year of
ownership, while I devote my attentions to the success of impending community art project goals as briefly described above. 
<br/><br/>Please know that every single donation amount counts toward the goal of beating the odds for 
funding my dream of buying my first home so, don't be put off by the total here. Even if the campaign
 falls short, and we only raise say 1/3rd of the total-  I will choose to rent locally, and maybe we will have 
achieved raising enough funding so that I am free to focus on the community art 
project for the next twelve months. <br/><br/>Either way, because I've chosen to make this a Flexible Funding campaign- I will keep what we do raise and put it to good use. And that's ok, too. <br/>In fact, my blog is a good place to keep up with what comes with me, and with the community art project, after this campaign ends- 40 days after it is launched. <br/>And since beyond my housing, the first priority is the community art project- there are development goals that can definitely benefit from whatever funds may prove to be extra. Such as replacing my computer
 that recently gave up the ghost after working like a draft horse 
non-stop for years. I miss it, and my project work needs it.<br/>
</div> <div> <p></p>
<p>
Obviously,
owning one’s home provides emotional and psychological solvency in America. Remember
that very independent child I alluded to raising on my own? What words can
describe the shift for her to know that her idealistic dreamer of an only
parent has finally accomplished the stable, solid life that I’ve always told my child
is possible in this country, when one keeps working hard towards one's dreams and
goals.
<br/></p>
<p>As
a young child growing up in France for a few significant years in my childhood,
my father was stationed there as a pilot in the US Military. It was he who
instilled in me our national ideals; to believe in one’s self, trust in our
freedoms, represent our country well, and to work hard towards one’s goals for the best potential in one’s
community. </p>
<p>As
an adult, artist and parent, I have worked hard and taken responsibility for
choosing and being chosen by art, by showing up in the studio and on location
to produce a body of work that has been exhibited locally, continues to attract a
following, and long-term patron support. <br/></p>
<p>I have and do volunteer in my
spiritual and community educational environments, where I have cultivated the
Looking/Seeing Project that I have taught ages from 2-92. <br/></p>
<p>Over time, that project
has evolved and today it continues to be refined and get adapted, as I learn and collaborate to take it into mobile technology. In smart phone technology more people in and visitors to our community get to access our community’s permanent
cultural legacy, called the Percent for Art Collection. We are building it with an engaging learning model that makes the encounter enriching and enjoyable for everyone. No background in the arts is required! <br/></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/733751/files/20140721145125-BR_Student_Exhibit_2014.png?1405979485"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/> In order for me to keep up my momentum as an artist
going forward on this project, a project that ultimately benefits everyone, it is critical that I secure my current housing now. I can do this with your help.

<p>Because we
are so close on this community art project, I must keep moving forward, and it is your contribution that will enable
me to buy my own home, so I can continue my work on the community art project. <br/></p>

</div> <div>
<img class=""lazy"" data-src="""" src="""" style=""""/>For the past three years while I was at the university, the idea for the community access to public art project took
shape. When I first shared the initial concept with the student provost’s

my name is Kerrie and ever since I was a little girl living in France with my
family, I’ve wanted to be an artist. All of my adult life, I’ve been
chipping away at HOW to make this dream my full-time occupation in realistic
ways, and still afford a roof over my head. For
35 years, I’ve lived in the same PNW university community and raised my own
child who is successfully chasing dreams of her own out in the world.  

                                    While
the price for my current artist abode matches the local market average, it is
beyond reach for an independent artist to purchase alone. Now, I
have an opportunity to buy the duplex that I’ve lived in for the past 5 years,
a home to me that is perfectly situated within walking/biking distance to both
the university and the downtown art scene.

That’s
where you come in- with the enthusiastic support of culture lovers of all
kinds, I can finally settle one of the biggest hurdles to my childhood dream: that of
having a permanent studio and home I can depend on, to ramp up my creative concentration
and output at long last. 
Oh, and buying this duplex provides a permanent home for one of my
muses, who loves his peaceful perches throughout the house.

What
your contribution helps me achieve is MAJOR stress relief at a critical
juncture between funding cycles on the community art project I am working on, and have been working on for three years now, as a recent university graduate in French.


Home
ownership is potent- it changes brain chemistry. That kind of peace of mind finds its
way into my sense of confidence and wonderfully affects everything I see and do
as an artist. 
I am free to value everything more, and I am more freed up to focus
energy and attention on the current community art project I have been collaborating on with partners at the university and in the local community. A sophisticated
project that will add to the public's discovery of not only a precious cultural legacy, but to one's own knowledge of just how valuable one’s eyes,
perceptions and perspectives are. Yet, to move through this critical juncture in the community art project, I must stabilize my housing and studio
requirements so I am free to remain to concentrated on the necessary work over the next 12 months, in order to reach our goals of getting
the project in front of next level investors by this time next year.
                                                                                          The
duplex is on the market for $229k.                                                                                          I am asking you to help me raise $239k to achieve
full successful purchase, with just enough to cover the costs in the first year of
ownership, while I devote my attentions to the success of impending community art project goals as briefly described above. 
Please know that every single donation amount counts toward the goal of beating the odds for 
funding my dream of buying my first home so, don't be put off by the total here. Even if the campaign
 falls short, and we only raise say 1/3rd of the total-  I will choose to rent locally, and maybe we will have 
achieved raising enough funding so that I am free to focus on the community art 
project for the next twelve months. Either way, because I've chosen to make this a Flexible Funding campaign- I will keep what we do raise and put it to good use. And that's ok, too. In fact, my blog is a good place to keep up with what comes with me, and with the community art project, after this campaign ends- 40 days after it is launched. And since beyond my housing, the first priority is the community art project- there are development goals that can definitely benefit from whatever funds may prove to be extra. Such as replacing my computer
 that recently gave up the ghost after working like a draft horse 
non-stop for years. I miss it, and my project work needs it.
  

Obviously,
owning one’s home provides emotional and psychological solvency in America. Remember
that very independent child I alluded to raising on my own? What words can
describe the shift for her to know that her idealistic dreamer of an only
parent has finally accomplished the stable, solid life that I’ve always told my child
is possible in this country, when one keeps working hard towards one's dreams and
goals.

As
a young child growing up in France for a few significant years in my childhood,
my father was stationed there as a pilot in the US Military. It was he who
instilled in me our national ideals; to believe in one’s self, trust in our
freedoms, represent our country well, and to work hard towards one’s goals for the best potential in one’s
community. 
As
an adult, artist and parent, I have worked hard and taken responsibility for
choosing and being chosen by art, by showing up in the studio and on location
to produce a body of work that has been exhibited locally, continues to attract a
following, and long-term patron support. 
I have and do volunteer in my
spiritual and community educational environments, where I have cultivated the
Looking/Seeing Project that I have taught ages from 2-92. 
Over time, that project
has evolved and today it continues to be refined and get adapted, as I learn and collaborate to take it into mobile technology. In smart phone technology more people in and visitors to our community get to access our community’s permanent
cultural legacy, called the Percent for Art Collection. We are building it with an engaging learning model that makes the encounter enriching and enjoyable for everyone. No background in the arts is required! 

 In order for me to keep up my momentum as an artist
going forward on this project, a project that ultimately benefits everyone, it is critical that I secure my current housing now. I can do this with your help.

Because we
are so close on this community art project, I must keep moving forward, and it is your contribution that will enable
me to buy my own home, so I can continue my work on the community art project. 
Click here for a brief look at a Prezi presentation of the community service art project idea.
 
For the past three years while I was at the university, the idea for the community access to public art project took
shape. When I first shared the initial concept with the student provost’s
office, the idea was met with resounding acknowledgment and support. This truly continues to be an important moment to me. Since 2011, I have collaborated
across academic programs and disciplines to attract partners I have successfully collaborated with, to realize the
proof-of-concept, and to build a consensus community of support.                                        Over this time, this project has become more than a
full-time job for me, and even though support has hit a temporary
funding gap at the end of 2nd-stage refinements, the work of innovation must
continue moving forward no matter what.

Now, with my current home on the market, I turn to you- my community for help because
without you, I will face no housing for the immediate future. 
Therefore, I ask that
you will support my campaign to stay on track on the community service art
project, by helping me to buy my home. 
With your support, the loss of time and
the diversion of energy becomes an avoided crisis for this dedicated artist-
busy innovating something new and enjoyable for all of us, for years to come. 


And without
your help, I immediately face being without a home by September 1, 2014. From that
point, I will need to divert all of my commitments to the art project, to
finding another paying job, and  to saving enough money over the coming months in order to afford

<h3>The summer of 2014 saw the beginning of an amazing program:</h3>The Ayatana Artist Research Program hosts artists from around the world while they experience natural phenomena with the guidance of scientists and non-art experts.  In this first summer we ran three projects with 10 artists and 14 experts who studied either biology and wildlife or the sky and flight. The artists grew glow in the dark mushrooms, climbed sacred trees, flew stunt kites, looked through microscopes and telescopes, howled at the super moon, chased invasive crabs and some of them jumped out of an airplane all the while learning from the shared knowledge of our crew of experts. The artists have now gone back to their respective homes and built a book.</div><div><br/></div><div style=""text-align: center;""><b>The artists involved:</b></div><div style=""text-align: center;"">

</div></div>","The summer of 2014 saw the beginning of an amazing program:The Ayatana Artist Research Program hosts artists from around the world while they experience natural phenomena with the guidance of scientists and non-art experts.  In this first summer we ran three projects with 10 artists and 14 experts who studied either biology and wildlife or the sky and flight. The artists grew glow in the dark mushrooms, climbed sacred trees, flew stunt kites, looked through microscopes and telescopes, howled at the super moon, chased invasive crabs and some of them jumped out of an airplane all the while learning from the shared knowledge of our crew of experts. The artists have now gone back to their respective homes and built a book.The artists involved:
Helga Jakobson, Winnipeg, Canada

Susan Rochester, Oregon, USA

Natalie Draz, Montreal, Canada
Sophie Lindsey, Portsmouth, EnglandLaura Grossett, Colorado, USASarah Fagan, Oregon, USARahni Allen, Tasmania, AustraliaElena Thomas, Washington, USACara Cole, BC, Canada
Alexis Williams, Ontario, Canada
The Plan:Together the books form a collection of 11 volumes: a catalogue and one book made by each of the 10 artists involved. We'd like to  give a copy of the collection to each of our experts and to artist's book libraries around the world.  But printing is expensive.   So we will print more copies and post them to contributors. If you buy a copy you will also be sponsoring the production of a copy to be given as a gift to one of our experts or a public collection.
The Books:Our collection of pocket sized books includes a 50 page catalogue of all the artists and the experts involved:                                                                   catalogueArtist's books:Each artist has made a single simple book.  They vary in format and are completely different in content. They are all the same dimensions and stack together tidily. They will all be printed and assembled for you by hand. If you only want one book you can chose which artist's book is for you. Or you can have them all:
Susan Rochester

Analysis  by Helga Jakobson (A scientific account of a magic spell)

Whilst I am at there I want to create new work, this will take the form of an Artist Book piece and a set of Letterpress prints.These pieces will be part of larger body of work and contribute to my overall grade for my Masters degree.
The Venice Art Biennial is on in July, I want to visit the many exhibitions all over the city and gather inspiration from the event. I would also use this opportunity to meet other artists and curators, exchange knowledge and extend my professional network.



What I Need & What You Get

The residency is partially funded by the Scuola but I still need £1000, to cover the remainder of the cost of the residency, plus flights, living expenses and art materials.
In return for your generous donations you will receive unique, handmade, letterpress printed goods.
Any contribution, great or small, will help towards the cost of the residency.



Impact

I believe this unique experience will have a massive impact on my career as an artist.
It will give  me new skills in my field that I can go on to share with others.
Help me to establish new networks with other artists and curators.
Allow me time to create new work that I can go on to exhibit or publish.
As a contributor your support will help directly with my development as an artist.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>The passions of my life are my Christian faith, my art, teaching and travelling. If I ever get to do all of them at once? Well things don't get much better than that!</p>
<p>I have been invited by Network of International Christian Schools (<a href=""https://nics.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://nics.org</a>) to spend 2 weeks in Caracas, Venzeula teaching art and performing my one-man-show, ""Thomas: Confessions of a Doubter."" I am very excited about the possibility of bringing new inspiration to the children of that country. I am also excited about being there with my nephew Tyler who is in his second year there and can be seen speaking half-way through the video.</p>
<p>I have been working for faith based organizations for the past 25 years (Rosebud School of the Arts, Canadian Badlands Passion Play) and have been a freelance art teacher for as long.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I am donating my time to this venture. Anything you donate will help to cover my costs. The amount is so low (I am always leary of how much money is spent on ""short-term missions"") because my plane ticket was purchased in Venezuela and now I need to reimburse NICS. Anything raised in excess will help to cover my cost of living during the trip since I'm a freelancer and don't have such things as paid holidays.</p>
<p>I don't have much to offer you in return for your support except my undying gratitude. Because it is a US organization I can not offer tax receipts. If you are an American and you would like a receipt, y<span>ou can instead go to the NICS website </span><a href=""https://nics.org/Donate.aspx"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">https://nics.org/Donate.aspx</a><span>, choose School Projects from the dropdown menu, and in ""Other Project"" put ""ACIC - Caracas, Venezuela (002143)"".

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This school is situated in a city of huge contrasts; wealth and poverty, security and violence. Though a Christian School, many of the students are not from Christian homes and are simply sent there to get an English language education. The chance to reach them with the Christian message and with love is great. The chance to help them find new skills and a different way of looking at the world and to develop self-confidence is also great.</p>

<p><strong>Muralist's Granddaughter Seeks Funding for Solo Art Exhibition in May 2013</strong></p>
<p><strong>Illness impacts finances!</strong></p>
<p>Hello, my name is Lynda (Whelan) Evans and I am the granddaughter of Ezra Winter, a renowned muralist from the 1920's through 40's. One of his most famous murals is the one in Radio City Music Hall in New York City...the huge one going up the grand staircase and you may have seen it.  By the way, the larger easel you see in my video was my grandfather's!  I am thrilled to have it and be painting at it.  My mother painted at this same easel, too.  It is a nice legacy and I am reminded of both of them every time I sit down to paint.</p>
<p>My husband was diagnosed with a stage 4 cancer not too long ago.  He came through it very well and is now in remission.  But, with him being out of work for 1 1/2 years during this trying stage of our lives, there was a huge impact on our finances.  This show was scheduled before his illness and I am trying my best to fulfill my obligation to the gallery and put on an excellent show.  My website can be viewed at: <a href=""http://www.LyndaEvansArt.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.LyndaEvansArt.com</a> and from there you can find information about the gallery...address, phone# and hours. It would be wonderful to see many of you there!</p>
<p>I am well on my way to fulfilling this tall order, but need some help with offsetting the cost, mainly for framing.  In addition to the materials for the show, I am responsible for all advertising and associated mailing costs, and food &amp; drinks for two receptions, which add up quickly.</p>
<p>Having started painting less than 10 years ago, I now work and sell from my studio/gallery next to my home.  My works are in many private collections all across the East and the Midwest.  I pride myself in being able to be flexible to meet a patron’s wishes in completing commissions and love inviting people into my workplace to show them what I am doing.</p>
<p>My first solo art exhibition was in 2010 and I did very well. I was the second highest selling artist of the season in the gallery and was second only to a very well known artist.  The same gallery has asked me back again for a second exhibition this coming May. I will need between 45 &amp; 50 works to fill the gallery, at a considerable cost just for the substrates and framing materials.</p>
<p>Your contribution will help make this show even better, allowing me to purchase quality frames, advertise more widely, and provide for two ""Meet the Artist"" receptions. Having a successful show will be a big boost to my painting career and any help will be greatly appreciated. If you are unable to directly contribute to my campaign I ask that you help spread the word by forwarding this to anyone you think may be interested enough to contribute.</p>
<p>Thank you for taking the time to read this and I hope that together we will be able to meet my goals for this major exhibition.</p>

Is someone from your close family having a birthday soon
Are your parents having an anniversary
Would you like to congratulate your child at some special event
Did you remember some old good friend and you would like to tell them
that you  miss them

We are offering you a gift card. A present which will leave everybody
speachless and touched.
We will send a letter with your name from long distant Land of love, with
your words of love and suprise your beloved ones. This gift card will be first
class original suprise.






You must be wondering now where this Land of love is. The same will happen
with the person who will receive this present with love from you.

Once
upon a time, in a magical land, which was green in the summer, and white in the
winter, in this land full of castles lived Prince S and Princess Nia. They
became friends when they were little kids but while they were growing up their
friendship developed into love. All people in this land was happy because the
love of Prince S and Princess Nia inspired everybody. From village to village
everybody knew that Prince S is in love with Princess Nia. In the end everybody
was whispering S love Nia. 
And
since then the land full of love was called SLOVENIA. 
This
story is maybe real or maybe just one part of it. Nobody remembers full story
but land Slovenia still exist. Slovenia is the only country on Earth that has
word LOVE in her name.

REMEMBER THIS:

We will make sure for your wishes. Submit your order today  and we
will make sure that your letter of love comes on the day that you request.
You will never again forget to congratulate someone, we will make sure of
it
On the day that you would like us to send your letter, we will inform you
on your email, that the letter was sent.
You can order weeks or even months in advance, from then on it will be our
concern to make sure that your beloved one will get your letter of love.


We will send the letter of love with your words to where you will decide. At
getting the letter this person will be suprised because he will get the letter
from The Land Of LOVE. At first he will not know who send him this letter from
the country that he had never heard before but when he will open it he will
know . In the front will be a photo and a notice that he get a letter from the
land of love. He will ask himself where is this land. In the back page will be
written how this land got the name. Inside will be a photo of this land and in
this photo will be your small photo,so this is how he will know who send him
this. Inside will also be written what you will write only to him/her and it
can be in your language,whichever you want. As he is opening the letter he will feel
our magic ,which we will add,something that he can feel but not see…


your photo, if you want it to be included in the gift card

your  words, wishes, greetings ( send us in which language you want)

the address to where you want us it to send, (you can send it worldwide)

date, on which you want gift card to be sent. On this day the letter will be send
and you will get email that the letter was sent.


Here are informations (click here),where you can see how much time the letter needs to come
from the land of love (Slovenia) to where you send it, and you do the math how
much days before you need us to send it.exampleYou would like to send letter from land of love to your mother for her birthday. Your mum lives in Australia. Her birthday is on 15 of May. Check the list  here and you will find out that letter need 4-6 days to get to Australia. If you want the letter on her adress on 15 of May, then you should inform us to send your letter 6 days before the dare you want her to recieve it, which is on 9 of May. You just need to follow the instructions on our website, where you can order a Gift Card and enter information for order on that product ( in this case on 9 of May). On this day 9 of May we will dispatch your order.

We are sure that everybody who will get this letter from the Land of love, will
be happy and surprised.

Our biggest wish is that we will send at least one letter of love in every country.

Love overcomes all obstacles,this is our motto, and we wish that with our and your  help, the
world becomes better, full of love.

<h3>On June 8, 2013, the One Million Bones project will culminate with an installation of 1,000,000 handmade bones on the National Mall! For the past three years, over one hundred thousand students, artists, activists and educators from all fifty states and thirty plus countries have been crafting replica human bones to recognize the victims and survivors of ongoing genocide and mass atrocities. These bones will be laid out together in a historic event that will not soon be forgotten. </h3>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We're really excited to launch this campaign and ask our community to help us take the final step in producing the culminating installation! This campaign is to help fund the transportation of the bones to the National Mall, the stage and sound for our speakers and security on the National Mall to ensure the bones remain safely on display for three days, bringing speakers to the installation, covering the cost to print the One Million Bones Memory Book and the cost for the bones to travel to their permanent home.  </p>
<h3><span style=""font-size: 1.17em;"">Saturday, June 8th:</span></h3>
<p>Starting at 10:00 am, volunteers dressed in white will begin to lay 1,000,000 handmade bones on the National Malll. Sign up <a href=""http://onemillionbones.squarespace.com/dc-signup/?SSScrollPosition=0"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here</a> to let us know that you'll be joining us to lay down bones!</p>

<h3><span style=""font-size: 1.17em;"">What is One Million Bones?</span></h3>
<p>One Million Bones is a large scale social arts practice, meaning we use education, hands-on art making and large public installations to raise awareness of ongoing genocide and mass atrocities happening today in Sudan, South Sudan, Somalia, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Burma. For the past three years students, artists, educators and activists have been crafting replica human bones out of clay, paper and plaster to symbolize those lost to these conflicts. Through a partnership with Students Rebuild, the Bezos Family Foundation donated $1 for every bone made, up to $500,000 for CARE’s relief work in Somalia and the Democratic Republic of Congo. We are proud to say that in March of 2013, we reached our $500,000 goal!</p>
<p>On June 8, 2013, thousands of volunteers dressed in white will lay one million of these handmade bones on the National Mall in Washington DC to create a symbolic mass grave and visual petition. We use the symbol of the bone not only to attest to the gravity of these conflicts but also, more importantly, as a symbol of our common humanity and a reminder that we belong to each other. </p>
<h3>What We've Done</h3>
<p>In August of 2011, we held our first preview installation of 50,000 bones in Albuquerque, New Mexico where over 200 volunteers laid down bones at the intersection of Route 66 and Fourth Street. To watch a short 3 – minute video of that installation click <a href=""http://youtu.be/uGUlB81MKOI"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here!</a></p>
<p>Eight months later, we held another preview installation in New Orleans, Louisiana, when 50,000 bones were laid down in historic Congo Square in Louis Armstrong Park. All 50,000 of these bones were crafted by the New Orleans Community, where youth were able to use the project as a way to confront and discuss the violence they experienced in their own lives, seeing a connection from local to global and relating to their peers thousands of miles away. To see a short video of that installation click <a href=""http://youtu.be/6S3UpNnCiUo"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here!</a></p>
<p>On April 28, 2012 our ten month Road to Washington Campaign culminated in thirty five mini installations in thirty four state capitals. They were all volunteer led and organized, check out some videos from the <a href=""http://youtu.be/7Zhd8bt4xG0"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Tallahassee</a> installation and <a href=""http://youtu.be/ttk55foTJG0"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Austin</a> installation! </p>

<h3> </h3>
</div></div>","On June 8, 2013, the One Million Bones project will culminate with an installation of 1,000,000 handmade bones on the National Mall! For the past three years, over one hundred thousand students, artists, activists and educators from all fifty states and thirty plus countries have been crafting replica human bones to recognize the victims and survivors of ongoing genocide and mass atrocities. These bones will be laid out together in a historic event that will not soon be forgotten. 
The Impact
We're really excited to launch this campaign and ask our community to help us take the final step in producing the culminating installation! This campaign is to help fund the transportation of the bones to the National Mall, the stage and sound for our speakers and security on the National Mall to ensure the bones remain safely on display for three days, bringing speakers to the installation, covering the cost to print the One Million Bones Memory Book and the cost for the bones to travel to their permanent home.  
Saturday, June 8th:
Starting at 10:00 am, volunteers dressed in white will begin to lay 1,000,000 handmade bones on the National Malll. Sign up here to let us know that you'll be joining us to lay down bones!
From 4:00 - 6:00 pm we will have international speakers and performers such as Neema Namadamu, John Dau, Mukesh Kapila and a performance from Elikeh - Stay tuned as we continue to announce more speakers and performers for Saturday's event!

<p>You find <b>CHRONOSYDRA</b> on your ride through the deep playa. Its size in relation to you evokes the scale of a board-game timepiece if you were a player’s token. The wood base is wide enough to provide you a seat in its shade, and the benches around it double as your bike rack. You look closer, and see that it is not static, but a working hourglass that is filling upwards with small particulates that float from bottom to top chamber; its translucent pellets catch the sunlight during the day and swirl like fireflies when LED-lit at night.</p>
<p>Like a meter that measures the growing creativity and energy around it, this hourglass fills steadily over the length of the event and stands full at exodus; full like an hourglass that has just been turned over, full like time itself has been turned back. <b>CHRONOSYDRA</b> is an art piece that mirrors the week-long transformation of Black Rock City, and playfully reflects on the way in which our time at Burning Man may reset, revivify, and refill us if we let it.</p>

<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Inspired by Greek water clocks <i>klepsydra </i>|<i>  </i>Chronos<i> (of Time) </i>+ Hydra<i> (<i>of Water)  </i></i></p>
<p><b>CHRONOSYDRA </b>will be a working hourglass made of acrylic, wood, and steel that stands nearly 11'-0"" tall and almost 10'-0"" in diameter. Around the hourglass will be a ring of additional benches to complete this meditative oasis. At night, we will be illuminating the hourglass with over 100 ft of LED lights!</p>

<p> </p>
<h3>HOW DOES IT WORK?</h3>
<p>Magic!</p>
<p>...and a lot of science (<i>put your goggles on!</i>). The steel and wood frame of  <b>CHRONOSYDRA</b> will support an 8'-0"" tall acrylic hourglass that has a top and bottom chamber separated by an aperture (<i>a super tiny opening). </i>Before we get to Black Rock City, the bottom chamber will be filled with recycled plastic pellets. With the first sunrise of Burning Man 2016 we will fill the entire hourglass with water. Because the plastic pellets are less dense than the water, they will float from the bottom to the top chamber over our week together on the playa. We are calibrating the hourglass to run for 7 days by regulating the size of the aperture and the number of pellets within the system. </p>

This will be my tenth printing project that is an anthology of friend work!  Previous projects included a perfect bound 60+ page book full of comic stories about cats, on an array of colorful papers, with rounded edges. Another project was an anthology of moomin fanart comics with a risograph. This is my second Indiegogo campaign.
 

 
Risks & Challenges
All of the illustrations are complete, and 90% of the design work is complete, but I suppose things could still go wrong!  I've built in a few extra weeks to give our friends at Secret Room Press time to print the calendar, and get it to me for shipping to folks by Christmas. Small challenges might mean printing in different colors than we expected, or that some text is less legible, but I'm ready to make it all work and have a beautiful calendar to share with everyone. I'm hoping you'll bear with us in this small print-run in a technology I'm not used to designing for.  Also, if it builds confidence I should note I run an etsy shop and completed 367 orders, with only 5-star reviews.  I also help run the Portland Zine Symposium, which has a several thousand dollar budget, and organized an art retreat for 11 artists at the Oregon Coast last winter.


Spread the wordIf you can't donate, you can also share with your friends about the project! At the top of the page, by the campaign image on the right there's indiegogo's share tools. Even the small tiers help cover printing and then go towards the artists on the project.  Thanks everyone for all shows of support!

I started writing songs when I was 13 or 14 in the hope of making people resonate with my creations, just like I resonated with the songs and poems of the artists who I admired. During these 25 years there have been moments of doubt and insecurity but I have never given up my dream of creating decent musical and poetical pieces. Poetry and music have always been my chosen form of expression and I have worked hard during this time to improve and perfect them both. However, I was not alone and I owe a lot of my artistic growth to a series of talented artists and wonderful people I have met along the way. Artists like The Quivering Poets. </p><p><i>Llevo 25 años componiendo temas y escribiendo poesía. Además he actuado en Gibraltar, Perú, Barcelona, y Londres durante más de 25 años.

Little did I know that these musicians would then meet, create thre musical landscapes together and tour in the formation we now know as The Quivering Poets. I was also pleasantly surprised by their synergy both musically and in terms of personality and their willingness to work in this project with the added difficulties of residing in different countries: half of them were in Barcelona and half were in London. They have committed to this project so much and we have become such good friends and musical companions that we have decided to record the whole new album together. This is incredibly exciting for me as I admire both their artistry and their humanity.  </p><p><i>Durante la grabación de mi primer disco en 2015, Love and Decadence, reuní una serie de músicos para grabar los arreglos de mis primeros temas en EP.

También me sorprendió lo mucho que se compenetrarían musicalmente y como se comprometieran a mi proyecto musical a pesar de vivir en países distintos: parte de los poetas trémulos residen en Inglaterra y la otra parte en Barcelona.
