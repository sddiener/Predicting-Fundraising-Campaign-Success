<h3>Chapter 1: How This Came to Be</h3>
<p>It's always been a dream of mine to record a folk Christmas album drawing on celtic music and old carols. This past December during my Celtic Christmas tour the opportunity came up to record a live album at the fantastic Carnegie Music Hall near Pittsburgh, PA, and I jumped at the opportunity! With temporary funding coming directly from a friend, we hired a professional recording engineer to record the whole concert and make this album a reality! I've already done most of the post-production studio time at Innovation Studios in Steubenville, OH and we are close to getting that part of things wrapped up! At this point we just need to start pre-orders to cover the funding of the project so we can get this album out to YOU as soon as possible!</p>

<h3>Chapter 2: The Artists</h3>
<p><strong>Ben-David Warner</strong> is a multi-instrumentalist, singer, and songwriter with roots in Celtic, Classical, and Folk music. For four years he was a member of the Celtic Americana Band Scythian, which Nashville's Music City Roots says is ""what happens when rock star charisma meets Celtic dervish fiddling."" Trained on the classical violin, Ben-David plays the banjo, fiddle, viola, guitar, and mandolin. Ed Helms’s The Bluegrass Situation praises his new Scythian song “Built These Walls” as a “blue-collar ballad we can all get behind.”</p>
<p><strong>Julia Kwolyk</strong> has been playing the violin for 27 years and teaching it for 15. Julia studied the violin at the Boston University Tanglewood Institute, served as concert mistress at the Connecticut College orchestra, and earned her B.A. in Music from Furman University in 2007. </p>
<p><strong>Nolan Ladewski</strong> began learning the tin whistle at age 6 and began touring at 12 with the band Kennedy's Kitchen. He added the flute to his repertoire, and honing his craft, Nolan qualified and competed in the All Ireland Competition in 2000 at the age of 13. Since then he has become a veteran on the US Celtic Festival circuit, and is now a full time member of the Celtic/Americana band Scythian. </p>
<p><strong>Erin Flynn</strong> earned a B.A. in Music with a concentration in cello performance at Kutztown University, and studied chamber music under Maria Asteriadou of Manhattan School of Music and the concertmaster of the New York Ballet. She has playing musicals with various companies and has played with the James Madison University Symphony and The University of the Shenandoah Symphony Orchestra.</p>

<h3>Chapter 3: How YOU Can Make This Album a Reality</h3>
<p>Essentially this campaign is a glorified pre-order opportunity. You get to be the first ones to hear the album, and your pre-orders help me cover the cost of the production. It's a win-win:)!</p>
<p>You are the record label, the producer, the advertising team, the art patron, the benefactor, AND the beneficiary:)!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Chapter 4: Every Purchase Counts</h3>
<p>In 2015, I was able to raise over $11,000 through the generous contributions of friends and fans who wanted to hear my debut album. I am still as grateful as I was when I would see the pre-orders coming in everyday during that campaign! The costs are much lower on this album due to the nature of doing a live album (one concert verses 2 weeks in a studio) so I hope we can raise this quickly and get the album out!</p>
<p>No matter what package you choose, every order brings us that much closer to being able to release the album! Every person, every purchase is truly indispensable! </p>

<h3>Hey! </h3>
<p>I’m Madge.<strong> I’ve been a professional actor in NYC for nearly a decade.</strong> I started writing songs in 2017 amidst coming out as a queer woman, coping with a bad breakup and combatting the isolation of life on the road with a Broadway National Tour. <strong>What sparked as healing practice burst into flame in 2020 as the world ground to a halt and in newfound isolation, I suddenly had the gift of time to resume writing. </strong></p>
<p>Beneath the sparkles and spandex, I’m a person who feels deeply. <strong>What I can’t share in stories, I put into songs.</strong> I started sharing these songs in an online class, virtual open mic nights, and a charity concert live streamed from my bathtub. Friends and strangers emailed, texted, DMed about how my work resonated with them. <strong>The songs that helped heal me were healing others too</strong>. I soon realized that these songs deserved more than an iPhone voice memo. </p>
<p><strong>With your help, I’m raising funds to record and produce my first EP. </strong>Through your support, I will be able to create a quality, fully arranged recording of my original music in a way that properly compensates all the artists involved in a time when live music as we know it is shut down.<strong> I am nothing without the love and care of community and it is my hope that this campaign reflects that. </strong>Together, we will create an EP of original music that will bridge the isolation of pandemic life and the grief of heartbreak and growth. <strong>Thank you from the bottom of my glittery, sad-song loving heart.</strong></p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p><u><strong>The Queer Experience</strong></u></p>
<p><strong>My songwriting began  around the same time I was coming into the fullness of my identity as a queer woman</strong>. As a feminine presenting queer person, I am frequently coded as ‘straight’ and struggled to find representation outside of rigid stereotypes. In fact, I wrote ‘Lipstick’ (a driving pop dance anthem) about the delights of femme for femme romance, <strong>something we hardly see represented in queer media</strong>. <i><strong>By funding this project you are helping to bring queer stories and queer artists to light </strong></i></p>
<p><strong><u>Personal stories, Universal themes</u></strong></p>
<p>These songs were  written over the last four years and encapsulate a precious and transformative time in my life. <strong>Ripped from my journal and my therapy sessions, these songs chronicle a first heartbreak, relationship foibles and the beautiful, painful journey of walking into my fullest self. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Although these songs have deeply personal elements, they speak to wider universal themes; the search for love and acceptance, gutting heartbreak, and the joy of owning one’s truth. Writing has helped to liberate me and by sharing these songs, I hope to inspire others to liberate themselves as well.</strong></p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Asking for money right now can feel audacious. <i>Who am I to ask for support?</i> <strong>Over my near decade as an actor in NYC, I have contributed my time and talents to fundraising for others through countless benefits, mutual aid, and charity events</strong>. My first bathroom concert in August raised over $2400 for Middle Collegiate Church’s social justice work and theatre scholarships for underrepresented artists at Jen Waldman Studio. This time around, I am taking the vulnerable step to take my turn and ask for your support for this dream project of mine.</p>
<p>By donating you are supporting art and artists, something vital in this time. <strong>Telling stories has been a fundamental part of the human experience, something that allows us to make meaning of and process the world around us</strong>. If you’ve watched a Netflix show, downloaded a new album, watched a streaming concert over the past year, then you’ve experienced this impact firsthand. </p>
<p><i>Finally, we’re still in a pandemic</i>. Once we’ve raised the funds, we plan to abide by the latest COVID-19 procedures once we enter the studio, including regular testing, temperature checks, masks and sanitizing.</p>

<p>The Rock n Roll Camp for Girls Orange County is a not-for-profit organization that provides a soap box for girls to rock. Through musical instrument instruction, workshops, and music, we aim to provide a space for girls to create, inspire, and thrive. We have grown so much since our first camp in 2013. In 2014 we served 75 girls, doubling in size from our inaugural year. We are entering our 3rd year of programming and expect 2015 to be the biggest yet! </p>
<p>We are 100% volunteer run and operated. We are dedicated to making our programs accessible to everyone. The Rock n Roll Camp for Girls OC has transformed from a dream to a community, and we are so grateful for all of the love and support we have received. </p> </div> <div> <h3><br/></h3>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p></p>
<p>Our camp is 100% sliding scale, meaning no one is turned away from attending camp or the showcase for lack of funds. We ask for families to pay whatever they can afford. </p>
<p></p>

</div></div>","Who are we? GIRLS ROCK OC! 
The Rock n Roll Camp for Girls Orange County is a not-for-profit organization that provides a soap box for girls to rock. Through musical instrument instruction, workshops, and music, we aim to provide a space for girls to create, inspire, and thrive. We have grown so much since our first camp in 2013. In 2014 we served 75 girls, doubling in size from our inaugural year. We are entering our 3rd year of programming and expect 2015 to be the biggest yet! 
We are 100% volunteer run and operated. We are dedicated to making our programs accessible to everyone. The Rock n Roll Camp for Girls OC has transformed from a dream to a community, and we are so grateful for all of the love and support we have received.    
    The Impact 
Our camp is 100% sliding scale, meaning no one is turned away from attending camp or the showcase for lack of funds. We ask for families to pay whatever they can afford. 


94.4% of our Campers take advantage of the sliding scale tuition. 
The average price paid per camper was $99.24
37% of campers from Year 1 returned for Year 2!
25 bands have been formed and written original songs!
100% of campers pushed themselves, made new friends, learned new instruments and rocked the showcase!!
100% of our teachers, mentors, assistants, and organizers are non-paid volunteers.
100% of our work is funded by our community

WHAT DO WE NEED?
Since our program has grown, our operating costs have risen and we could really use help making sure we have the necessary expenses covered. This year we are reaching out to our community to help with funds for:



Music gear
Supplies (paper, printing, walkie talkies, necessary office and art supplies, etc)
Facility rental (Includes lunch for campers who request one)
Insurance
Food for our volunteers 
Fingerprinting and background checking volunteers
Showcase venue expenses



    Other Ways You Can Help 
Sometimes, monetary donations are not something everyone can do. There are many ways to help out the Rock n Roll Camp for Girls OC that don't involve donating. If you can't donate, consider: 

Sharing this IndieGoGo page
Donating gear, food, or supplies
Loaning us gear the week of camp

Sign up to Volunteer Here to with us during the week of camp! 
Facilitating a fundraiser show/event in your area on our behalf!
Telling a friend about our organization
Asking your employer about donating gift cards or other resources

Thank you for taking the time to check out our indie-go-go page, and thank you again to all of our amazing community members who have helped us get off the ground and supported us since day one.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Within recent years, Peacemaker Nation's lead vocalist and songwriter, Average Joe continued polishing his musical sound by crafting a ten-track solo album <i>Who We Are</i>, which offers an autobiographical concept album geared towards the illustration and proper depiction of Average Joe's ethnic, cultural and social background, as a Samoan-American artist from Seattle.  Average Joe shares his love for Soul, R&amp;B, Hip Hop and Electronica music through each of his tracks.  <br/></p>
<p>It has been many years in the works and, finally, Island-Soul artist, Average Joe is releasing his solo debut album, <i>Who We Are</i>!  What makes this deal so much sweeter is that Average Joe gets to share his debut album on the road touring with his band, Peacemaker Nation!  </p>
<p>We'd like to invite you to participate with us in a DREAM COME TRUE for this band of brothers!<br/></p>
</div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>We are campaigning to $5,000 in the next 35 days.  <br/></p>
<p>Funds will assist us by taking care of some household business items such as copyrights, trademarks and publishing original musical material.  These funds will also help support the completion of the album which needs pressing and packaging, along with creating a website and flyers to help SPREAD THE MUSIC!  </p>
<p>Finally, funds will help with touring needs such as food and lodging, vehicle rental and gas, along with a few airplane tickets for our guys who have job and family responsibilities back home in Seattle.  <br/></p>
<p>Some great PERKS that comes along with your financial contribution include Average Joe &amp; Peacemaker Nation buttons, stickers, Shout-Outs on our social media outlets, t-shirts, music downloads, studio recording sessions, photo shoots, EXCLUSIVE Meet-&amp;-Greet with the band, guest list spots to an upcoming show of your choice on the tour, a private Peacemaker Nation performance at your next event, and MORE!  <br/></p>
<p>If we do not reach our entire goal for this campaign, the funds will still go towards the needs of this tour and the completion of the album.  But, we will continue raising support until we've accomplished what we set out to do, and that is to produce an album and to tour the world and share the love through our MUSIC!  <br/></p>
</div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The message that we share with people through our music came at a cost of living life as a Pacific-Islander growing up in the United States, more specifically living in Seattle, Washington.  Our experiences have given us life lessons that tell the story of love and hate, peace and war, rich and poor, all the while highlighting the ethnic, cultural and social conditions of our upbringing.  After years of cultivating our writings and our musical sound, Average Joe &amp; Peacemaker Nation is proud to share our creations with the WORLD by releasing an album along with touring and performing on stages for the masses!  <br/></p>
</div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Some of the risks &amp; challenges that we may face if we do not achieve our financial goal will be the delaying of the Who We Are album release date, along with missing out on this opportunity to tour.  Much of the album is already completed, but there are still some final steps that need to be taken.  We've also been invited by Keep It Litt Records to take part in The Climax Tour, which will go throughout California, Washington, Oregon, Utah, Nevada and Arizona.  <br/></p>
<p>We want to open up the opportunity to as many fans of good music to be a part in the creation of Average Joe's album.  So, whether your bank account allows you to invest a large amount or a small amount, we'd love to have as many PEOPLE to be a part of this movement as possible.<br/></p>
</div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p>Even if you cannot offer a monetary contribution to our campaign, there are still many other ways to help!  Here are a few: <br/></p>
<ul> <li>Spread the news and make some noise about the Average Joe &amp; Peacemaker Nation Tour Campaign!<br/>
</li> <li>Ask your rich relatives and friends if they could check out our Campaign! <br/>

My dad, Steve Williams, has done his time as an electric guitar and keyboard player in his own punk/new wave band years ago, and we joined forces in 2012 to start playing shows around town in San Antonio, TX. I kept writing songs and teaching them to my dad, and in the fall of 2013, we released our first EP. We took it to our home state of Michigan for an incredibly fun release show, and then brought it back to San Antonio, TX to our favorite venue Imagine Books &amp; Records for an equally amazing show. After a year of writing, recording, and playing shows, I put together a second EP off to the side by myself and the response was very positive and motivating. Now, we are finally ready to take a selection of these songs, plus even more unreleased material, and compile a record to share with you! </span></p>

<h3>The Perks</h3>
<div>Wondering what each perk is exactly? Below are some more detailed descriptions of each item!</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Digital Download - </b>On the day of release (to be announced), you will receive an email from me with a download code and a link. You will then be able to go to the link and enter the code for an immediate download of the album! Includes cover and insert artwork as photo files (.jpg). </li>
<li>
<b>Physical CD - </b>This is the actual copy of the album! While the record is still being recorded and we are not ready to begin production of the CDs, our idea for the physical copy is a matte finished wallet case with a spine, back, and two inside panels, one for liner notes/thank yous and the other with a pocket for the CD. Physical presentation is subject to change, but this is the basic premise! If you choose one of the packages that includes a signed CD, please note that the cellophane wrapping will be removed and the front of the CD will be signed. </li>
<li>
<b>Bonus CD - </b>This exclusive bonus CD is something that I'm personally working on myself. It will include alternate versions for three of the songs from the record and one previously unreleased song.</li>
</ul>
<div>        Alternate versions include:    - ""The Curse""                                                                                                                                            - ""Crystal Flame""                                                                                                                                    - ""I Saw You Standing There""</div>
</div>
<div>        Unreleased song:                      - ""Follow You"" </div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Poster - </b>This will be one groovy 11"" x 17"" poster printed with high quality ink and on durable poster stock paper. The design will be posted right here as soon as it is final. I will make an announcement on my Facebook page (<a href=""http://www.facebook.com/alixwilliams.tunes"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.facebook.com/alixwilliams.tunes</a>) when it is up for you to see! I promise it will be amazing and look great on your wall! </li>
<li>
<b>T-Shirt - </b>This will be a multi-colored design printed on quality material for long-lasting durability. Our idea right now includes a dark maroon t-shirt with a design including ""alix williams"" and possibly the title of the album once that is released. Design is subject to change from this original idea, but dark maroon is my favorite color so I most likely will not be budging on that ;)  Here is a rough draft of the design: <p></p>

</li>
<li>
<b>Instant Photo - </b>I have a Fuji Film Instax Mini camera and it works basically just like a Polaroid. The pictures come right out of the top, develop, and look really awesome. An incredibly amazing person gave me the idea of taking some instant pictures throughout the making of the album and including them as perks for the campaign! If you choose the ""Groupie + Instant Picture"" package you'll receive an instant picture from, for example, the photo shoot for the album cover, in the studio, or a band rehearsal. Each photo will be dated at the bottom and include a notecard from me with a description! They'll look like this: </li>
</ul>

<p></p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Handwritten Lyrics - </b>For this one, you'll have a chance to listen to the record and then I'll email you and we can work out which song you would like to be handwritten! I'll write it on sturdy card stock paper in the structure of the song (verse, chorus, bridge, solo, etc.) plus doodle and decorate around the paper. It will be mailed to you in something where the paper will not have to be folded to fit in, so you'll get a nice smooth copy of lyrics from your favorite song of mine! </li>
<li>
<b>Behind the Scenes DVD - </b>During this whole week (March 7 - March 14) while we are recording and throughout the making of the album, I will be taking videos and pictures of all the different steps in the process. At the end of it all, I'll compile everything onto a DVD where you'll get access to exclusive pictures and videos that haven't been posted anywhere or previously released. You'll get to be a fly on the wall in the studio and at rehearsals. It will be great! </li>
<li>
<b>""Thank You"" in Liner Notes -</b> A panel (or insert) on the inside of the wallet case will include song credits as well as thank yous. The ""thank you"" space is where we mention all of the incredible and fantastic people who have helped this record be possible and for your generous donation, you will be graciously thanked with your name forever in the liner notes. </li>
<li>
<b>Pages of Notes + Fun Facts About Making the Record -</b> This includes a couple pages of notes that I've been taking about song arrangements, tempos, drums, instruments, etc. They'll come straight out of my personal notebook and be yours to keep! With this will also be a letter from me with little tidbits of information about writing/recording each song, like what it's about, additional voices you may hear on them, cool instruments that show up, and more! </li>
<li>
<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""><b>All Three Previous Releases -</b> This includes a physical copy of all three CD releases we've had. The first one being the self-titled EP released in November of 2013. The second is the accompanying Bonus CD for the debut EP with two new songs and three alternate acoustic versions of songs from the EP. The last release is the ""I Like You"" EP released in August of 2014. There is a very limited supply of these three CDs and more will not be made, so we're offering the last of them to you! </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">  </span>
</li>
<li><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""><b>House Concert - </b>This is a big one! We will personally make our way to your house with our guitars and microphones and give you and your friends an evening of music! The way it'll work is we will communicate directly with you about when we can get to your location, we'll plan a date, you'll invite your friends, and we will come jam in your living room (or patio, or deck, or kitchen)! We will only be able to reach areas within the continental United States. If you choose the ""Show in Your Living Room"" package, we will all have an extremely fun time!                                                                                                                        </span></li>

<h3>The Obstacles</h3>
</div>
</div>
</div><div> <p>With a project this big that includes as many people as it does, there are always obstacles we may face along the way. Recording may take longer than we expected, designs may not be finalized as quickly as we would like, and production of physical items always has the possibility of taking longer than expected, but we are determined, and this record will get finished! Our projected release month is June, and so far we are well on track to accomplish that goal. We have many ideas for touring with this record during the summertime, and are excited to share these tunes with you! With your help, the little things that may get in our way don't stand a chance! </p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Other Ways to Help</h3> <p>While backing us financially in our campaign is incredibly helpful, there are other things equally as helpful you can do that we would be extremely grateful for. Sharing the link to this Indiegogo page on your social media sites and telling your friends is a huge help! Getting as many people to view this page will help us a great deal in reaching our goal.

<div>I have always been put off by the saying ""YOLO"" however we do in fact only live once and sometimes it is very brief. This is an opportunity to make a dream a reality.</div> <p>Hi, I am Jeremy T McConnaha. For those of you who know me, you've seen me tour and play in several bands prominently as a drummer. However, a few years ago I realized my true passion was writing and performing my own music. Music is something that has inspired me my whole life. At an early age I was influenced so much by what I heard on the radio, friends and relatives records and what I saw on television. Music gives me purpose and is and has been for as long as I can remember what I am most passionate about.</p>
<p>That brings us to present day... I have recently been given the opportunity to record my debut solo E.P. with Mike Marsh of The Avett Brothers. Mike is an incredible musician and producer and has been a major influence on me as a singer and a drummer ever since I first saw him playing drums for Dashboard Confessional. I feel like the fact that Mike will be producing this E.P. makes the process that much more special, as not all artist have the opportunity to work with the people who inspired them to become what they are aspiring to be. This is that opportunity for me and I could not be happier about it. This campaign will help this dream become a reality. Not only will this allow me to work with an amazing producer and an incredible artist but it is the opportunity to work side by side with one of my biggest musical influences and produce my music for the first time.</p>
<p>I have been chasing this dream for a while now and I feel this is finally a shot to do what I have always wanted to do, a chance to bring purpose, passion and meaning to the forefront and most importantly show my kids (I have two kids, haha!) that following your dreams no matter what is what makes this life worth living.</p> </div> <div> <h3>Needs and Wants...</h3> <p></p>
<p>In order to make this dream a reality, I will need to raise 7,000 dollars. This money will allow me to record the E.P. with Mike, have it mastered, pressed and distributed. It will also allow me to pay for any instrumentation I will not provide on the EP such as strings, horns ect.</p>
<p><b>$3,000-</b>initial production of the E.P.</p>
<p>I will be singing and playing guitar on this record. I will also be playing drums, minus one song because to not have mikes percussive skills on this record would be insanely stupid on my part... However things I do not play well or at all such as piano, strings and horns will be an additional <b>$75.00</b> per song.</p>
<p><b>$500.00- </b>additional musicians and instrumentation</p>
<p><b>$1,000</b>- Mastering the E.P.</p>
<p><b>$1,000</b>- Pressing and distribution</p>

</h3>We are a hip-hop/bass music duo based in California, comprised of producer Trevor Kelly and vocalist Ro Knew. We met in 2011 as residents at Ritual SF and we've enjoyed working together on several musical collaborations over the years. In 2013, we decided to link on a full-length project. Instead of rushing to keep up with the fickle trends of electronic music, we wanted to make a well-thought out, meaningful, conceptual piece of art that would still hold value to the listener after years or even decades of listening. Thus, we decided to title the album ""Timeless,"" and release it on a 12"" vinyl record to give the listener something tangible.<br/><br/>The album features guest appearances from Sacramento MC <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/TASK1ne"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Task1Ne</a> and Chicago turntablist <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/djlimbs"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">DJ Limbs</a>.

Funds in excess of $3000 will be used for the production of music videos, an official website, Pacific Standard merchandise, and the creation of new music.<br/><br/>Anyone contributing through this campaign will receive a download of the single ""<a href=""https://soundcloud.com/pacificstandardtimeless/pacific-standard-dark-sky"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Dark Sky</a>"" in the format of your choice.

We're releasing this completely independently with no outside investors and no major label - so we are extremely grateful for anything and everything that our supporters can contribute! Funds in excess of $3000 will be used for the production of music videos, an official website, Pacific Standard merchandise, and the creation of new music.Anyone contributing through this campaign will receive a download of the single ""Dark Sky"" in the format of your choice. Please allow 1-3 days for us to send you a download link.
  Other Ways You Can HelpIf you aren't able to contribute at the moment, that's okay! Here are some other ways you can help us out on our journey to share this music with the world:  Post this campaign to your social media outlets and share it with your friends!
Follow us on Soundcloud, Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram!
 Come to our show when we play in your city!
   Every last bit of support is helpful! If you have any questions regarding this campaign, or would like to book Pacific Standard for a performance, please hit us up at PacificStandardTimeless@gmail.com.Thanks for your time and consideration,Trevor and Ro",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<div>WHAT WE NEED -</div> <ul> <li>The tracking for the album has been finished.  This means that the studio time, musicians, and mixing have been paid for; but there are still some things that need to be paid for before the album can be released.  </li>
<li>Mastering - Mastering is putting the ""topcoat"" on the mixed album.  It is the last step in the production process, and costs an estimated $1,000.</li>
<li>Replication - This is the copying process for CD's.  To replicate 1,000 hard copies of the album, it is going to cost about $1,800.</li>
<li>Radio promotion - This is how we get the music heard!  Radio promotion sends a single from the album out to radio stations across the state, and into the ears of new listeners and fans!  I will also be going out on tour, so you will get to hear and see your donation as it plays out.  A song will go to radio promotion for roughly 12-16 weeks, and this costs about $4,000 per song.  We hope to send TWO songs to radio promotion.</li>
<li>Merchandise - I am also hoping to get some new ""threads"" out to everyone!  One run of shirts costs roughly $500, and I will need both men's and women's sizes.

throught Austria, Germany, Denmark, Belgium, Holland, France,
Luxembourg and Switzerland, in wich<b> i'm going to record a music album</b>
with the help of a digital recorder and other instruments so as to
product a sort of sound reportage of the places I  will see, <b>Mainly
based on the use of samples of ambiental “noises”.</b></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
The
means I choose will be my father's old bicycle that has already
supported and carried me.</p>
<p>

<p>Our Master tapes are so old that they need to go thru a restoration process before they can be digitized for todays delivery standards.

We will also print t-shirts, and other various swag, and finally be able to release our music to the world in proper fashion.

We are grateful for your help, and we thank you in advance for helping us finish what we started 30 years ago!
    The Impact With your help we will be able to restore our ancient master tapes, have them digitized, remixed & have them digitally remastered. We will record, mix, & master 5-6 new songs, create artwork for the CD & press a limited quantity. We will also print t-shirts, and other various swag, and finally be able to release our music to the world in proper fashion. If you were ever a fan of the band, or 80's metal in general, you will not be disappointed. And if you play your cards right, you can join us for the 30 year reunion in July and party with us like it's 1985...

Thank You For Your Help, You're totally awesome, and We Love You!!!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Hello, my name is Camilo Toledo. I was born and raised in Antigua Guatemala, Central America. Ever since I was a kid I liked playing musical instruments and when I turned 15, I was already playing in working professional bands. After High School I studied music at the National Conservatory of Music in Guatemala City and later when I moved to the US, I studied music composition at UCLA.  Recently, I completed a certification in music production at UMBC.</p>
<p>I have lived in the area of Washington DC for the last 25 years, and have played and met many talented hispanic musicians that unfortunately do not get the opportunity to record their music and they loose the chance to be heard and get better jobs.</p>
<p>With your generous donations, I will be able to make this possible and do what I do best, music production. My project is to record 12 all original songs for a compilation CD using 4 or 6 of the most talented hispanic bands in the area, and record 2 songs which would be a collaboration from everybody. </p>
<p>Your donation and contribution to this project will let us pay for arrangements, rentals, recording time, mixing and mastering studio time, and any other cost related to releasing the songs online and pressing 1000 CD's.   </p>
<p>Your donation and contribution will help these bands have a professional recording of their songs but also, you will be contributing to provide assistance to undeserved people in Central America.  We plan to donate 400 CD's (or the proceedings) to a non-profit organization based in Arlington VA, that helps very poor people in El Salvador. </p><p>Your donation and contribution will be very welcome by two causes, musicians in the area, and people in need in el Salvador.</p>
<p>Please let me make this possible, and thank you for all your support.</p><p></p></div>","Hello, my name is Camilo Toledo. I was born and raised in Antigua Guatemala, Central America.

<p>Champaign Native and passionate Emcee KLEVAH has been spreading her sound throughout the last year, drawing a diverse crowd of admirers. KLEVAH has released two full-length projects, <b>GOLDEN</b> &amp; The W8, accompanied by visual work and performance. She has opened up for artists such as XXYYXX, Lil Bibby, Big Sean, Tink and has performed at SXSW, Summer Camp and Pygmalion Music Festivals. Her work can be accessed via klevahninja.bandcamp.com and soundcloud.com/klevah. </p>
<div><br/></div>
<div>After turning 25 years of age only a few weeks ago, KLEVAH is determined to drive her success forward and has solidified plans to spread her influence beyond the region. This will be an individual journey, however she is supported by a network of musicians, family and friends in each city she is scheduled to travel to. So far she has performances booked in Champaign and Chicago and planned appearances in Denver and St. Louis. She will utilize the next few weeks of downtime to book more shows and polish her presentation. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>This time is critical for her, and must be used wisely. She is not looking to profit from this tour, but to expand herself and take authority over her artistry. Any contributions to these efforts will ensure her security on the road and will boost her likely hood of being recognized nationwide. She is a brave soul and intends to bring more back with her than she left with. Her first scheduled performance is on July 8th, 2015 at SubT Lounge in Chicago, Illinois.</div> </div> <div> <h2><br/></h2>
<h2>What I'm Asking For</h2> <p>I will need $2500 to cover my expenses through August. It will be broken down between travel, equipment and promotional materials.</p> <ul> <li>Travel ($1500) - This will get me back and forth between Chicago and Champaign during the month of July. From Chicago to Denver at the end of the month, and from Denver to St. Louis and LA in August. As well as back home to Champaign-Urbana for Pygmalion in September. I will be traveling in my Dad's Volvo, so aside from gas, this portion of the money will only be used for emergencies.</li>
<li>Equipment ($500) - This will allow me to provide my supporters with a constant flow of media &amp; music while on my journey. Although I have some equipment, I will need to purchase a new microphone &amp; mic stand. If I have enough, I will consider purchasing a GoPro camera as well. </li>
<li>Promotional Materials ($500) - This includes posters, stickers, t-shirts, pressed CD's and website expenses. Much of these I have already been designing and selling on my own, but additional funds will allow me to put more into my brand and have quality presentation.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<p>In addition to performance, new music and building a network - I will also use Hip-Hop along my travels to support community organizations fighting for causes I believe in and against oppression. Feel free to connect me to any groups or leaders that you know personally in the states I will be traveling to.</p>
<p>I greatly appreciate your consideration and will be happy to answer any questions or concerns that you may have. Peace</p>

<div>We are a multi-genre, multi-lingual, travelling almost-gypsy band with big dreams. Based partialy in France and partially in the Czech Republic, we often travel to play in both of those countries and elsewhere, across the whole Europe. Our music is acoustic, energic and often surprising, and varies form simple dancing tunes or slow contemplative ballads to frenetic almost-freejazz collective improvisations. Our main influences are french chanson, gypsy swing, and french folk, but also klezmer and other traditional musics of eastern Europe, and sometimes even modern jazz and funk. Double bass, guitar, accordion,  clarinet and soxopohone are our tools and our best friends on the big travel through life and music. With the help of these time-tested acoustic instruments, we try to make something new from the old and beloved. </div>

Who am I exactly and WHAT is my story?



My name is Kori Linae Carothers.  I am a wife, mom AND I am a concert pianist/composer and I live in Southern California.  Ever since I could remember I have always wanted to record, release and perform my music. I compose instrumental, electronic and contemporary solo piano. My music is similar to Bill Evans, Phil Aaberg, Mannheim Steamroller, Bernward Koch to name a few.

They knew I was very talented and encouraged my dream by giving me the gift of piano lessons!

What do I want to do?
Fast Forward to the present:  In 2009, I met and worked with one of my influences, Grammy Winning Guitarist and Founder of Windham Hill Records:  Will Ackerman.  A mutual friend, thinking I would benefit from meeting Will, introduced us. 
As Will recounts:

<p>1,500$ would be an amazing amount of money that would make a lot of really awesome things come to life! If the goal is reached shows could start as early as this fall!</p>buying CD's and other raw media like shippers, cases, etc gets really expensive really fast. But buying in bulk proves to pay off in the long run.<br/>A domain to host content, with some additional space due to the streaming aspect, at least one more decent microphone, a mixer, and talent. <br/>
<p>I was looking at some modestly priced ""Home Recording Studio Kits"" which run about 200$ or so. These bundles come with a lot of the things that will be necessary to record audio</p>
<p>Raw media, CD's, Tapes, Cases, and other such items.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The breakdown (below) details what it would cost to produce a run of 
pressings that is separate form all currently scheduled releases.</p>
<p></p>
<p>At the end of this year Batting A Thousand will be putting out NEW 
music, the money raised here would be for a banging first 
pressing! all copies would be numbered and denote that they were 
""Powered by IndieGoGo""</p>
<br/>
<p>Exact costs- <br/></p>
<p><b>Studio bundle kit (for recording artists/the podcast) 230$- this includes a mixer, 1 condenser microphone and pop filter.<br/></b></p>
<p>
</p>
<p><b>Secure server space 200$/yr - 300$/yr (high bandwith needed for streaming etc ) Utilizing a D.I.Y. internet co-op to host content on a website that isn't bandcamp would be ideal to sell directly to people without being tied to a 3rd party.<br/></b></p>
<p>

Guiding Principals:
More
 Trees Records is a no profit Distro/Label that combines ethics of Anti-capitalism,
biocentrism, 
collective liberation,direct action, and solidarity to foster positive music scene(s). 
Many of us live in a scene that we don't identify with- or are 
completely against, thats why it is necessary to create the spaces we 
want to be in. Or take spaces when needed.
For close to 3 years now I've been organizing various things under the name ""More Trees Records"" but with this IndieGoGo- your support I promise you we can break into the stratosphere. It has been my life long dream to create a self sufficient ""no profit*"" collectively run distro. 
""*No Profit"" - any money gained from albums, artwork, etc will be given to those artists/individuals. 
Usually ""management"" would ask for percentage for doing business at the expense of ""talent.""- More Trees Records is proud to provide services from pressing, publishing, promoting, booking, and more for all free! 
Capitalism motivates lawyers and business people(s)  to view art and artists as just another resource to make it big without even playing a note. 
More
 Trees always has always put art and the creative talent of individual(s) as 
the driving motivation to keep going-.
But now it's time to take to 
the airwaves. With the power of the interwebz, More Trees Records plans 
to produce content twice monthly between 45-90 minutes long.
Why a Radio Show though?


For as long as I can remember I've loved radio one of the main goals of this project is to have a mouth piece for many other kinds of creative people(s) that a distro alone cannot accomplish. It will be host to a array of folks from artists, community organizers, bands, etc.


This show would be in addition to/to complement the artists, and friends of More Trees Records.
The show will consist of Stories & Report backs from the front lines, music, guests, and reviews. 


But What about the Music?
Fret not! the music is certainly not taking a back seat- in fact we're now working on our 2nd pressing of the Hudson Valley Earth First Comp! 


but wait there's a BIG announcement- NEW MUSIC FROM BATTING A THOUSAND!!!!!! 

the hope is to have new music from Batting A Thousand by the end of 2015 and what could kick off 2016 in a big way better than a serious release? 

-----------------------------------

What is needed-Whats the money gonna get?

1,500$ would be an amazing amount of money that would make a lot of really awesome things come to life! If the goal is reached shows could start as early as this fall!buying CD's and other raw media like shippers, cases, etc gets really expensive really fast. But buying in bulk proves to pay off in the long run.A domain to host content, with some additional space due to the streaming aspect, at least one more decent microphone, a mixer, and talent. 
I was looking at some modestly priced ""Home Recording Studio Kits"" which run about 200$ or so. These bundles come with a lot of the things that will be necessary to record audio
Raw media, CD's, Tapes, Cases, and other such items.

The breakdown (below) details what it would cost to produce a run of 
pressings that is separate form all currently scheduled releases.

At the end of this year Batting A Thousand will be putting out NEW 
music, the money raised here would be for a banging first 
pressing! all copies would be numbered and denote that they were 
""Powered by IndieGoGo""

Exact costs- 
Studio bundle kit (for recording artists/the podcast) 230$- this includes a mixer, 1 condenser microphone and pop filter.


Secure server space 200$/yr - 300$/yr (high bandwith needed for streaming etc ) Utilizing a D.I.Y. internet co-op to host content on a website that isn't bandcamp would be ideal to sell directly to people without being tied to a 3rd party.


1 extra headset microphone for guests 100$


Extra software for editing- 60$


CD's+Cases- 120$
Initial stipend/Gas money fund for guests - 250$

Fulfillment-


Money for shipping- (fulfillment) 100-200$ (depending on how many people get physical merch) 


Fulfillment for Indiegogo supporters 250$

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 

So why should the proletariat fund this?  


That something thats up to you, if the goal is reached a great deal of content and creativity can erupt!

Regardless of how well this campaign does or doesn't do More Trees 
Records will continue to actively support talented individuals and 
attempt to make connections between radical politics within the music 
scene. 
None of the money- and I mean none of the money will 
go into someones pocket for personal use 100% of funds raised goes 
directly into operation (pressing CD's, printing zines, equipment for More Trees Records Radio, server space, etc)
What has More Trees been up to?

We've released content from folks like ""Little Moss"" who's hit songs ""Road Block"" & ""LOCK"" are still bumping in the shale fields- and beyond!


 

To Releasing the full Discography of Batting A Thousand



And more recently a 2 disc benefit CD for a local Earth First! collective! 

If any of this was enticing to you and you chose to donate I'm truly blown away, if you get it but don't/can't throw in thats cool too- but sharing this page goes a long way!

<p><b>The Passion for the

<p>Hello, my name is Andy
Taylor, a singer song writer, from Ontario, Canada.</p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;""><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> I am in need of your help to complete a new CD project we have been working on entitled <b>""Nothing Short of a Miracle""</b></span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">.</span></span></p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;""><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">I have been told that my songs have a passionate, soulful flavour to them.</span></span></p>
<p>In 1999 I found myself on Vancouver Island, addicted and hopeless. At times I was eating in soup kitchens and frequenting food banks.</p>
<p>I was not far off from being out on the streets, as I
couldn't function in society any longer in the condition I was in.</p>
<p>God in His miraculous way, pulled me out of that grey mess I was in and saved me! He has given me purpose, a new life and family. He has given me a voice and a platform through performing music and giving testimony to His faithfulness. I want to continue to give back in
service and song. Singing for the people who find themselves hopeless, addicted, in need of
healing. Singing to people who simply need to be inspired, ministered to and lifted up. I sing in parks, churches, halls, institutions and I continue to record songs for radio airplay. </p>
<p></p>

<p>The truth is, I will sing anywhere I am lead to.</p>
<p>I have always known that music has a powerful
influence on people.</p>
<p>Certainly it has had a profound effect on my life in so many
ways. Music can motivate and energize. It soothes
the soul and can play a prominent part in healing and connection to God, others and our inner self.</p>
<p>In 2008 I released an album entitled “In the Stillness”. </p>
<p>Songs from that album were nominated in the 2008 GMA-Covenant Awards.</p>
<p>Canadian radio stations currently play tracks from
that album.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I will need your help however to continue. We have recorded <b>3 </b>of the<b> 7</b> songs
for the new album and now will need more funds to complete the project.</p>
<p>“Nothing Short of a Miracle” is a special collection of songs
that reflect my heart for God and the title speaks to His greatness, in that, He would save even ""a wretch like me”.</p>

</div></div>","The Passion for the
Project
Hello, my name is Andy
Taylor, a singer song writer, from Ontario, Canada.
 I am in need of your help to complete a new CD project we have been working on entitled ""Nothing Short of a Miracle"".
I have been told that my songs have a passionate, soulful flavour to them.
In 1999 I found myself on Vancouver Island, addicted and hopeless. At times I was eating in soup kitchens and frequenting food banks.
I was not far off from being out on the streets, as I
couldn't function in society any longer in the condition I was in.
God in His miraculous way, pulled me out of that grey mess I was in and saved me! He has given me purpose, a new life and family. He has given me a voice and a platform through performing music and giving testimony to His faithfulness. I want to continue to give back in
service and song. Singing for the people who find themselves hopeless, addicted, in need of
healing. Singing to people who simply need to be inspired, ministered to and lifted up. I sing in parks, churches, halls, institutions and I continue to record songs for radio airplay. 


The truth is, I will sing anywhere I am lead to.
I have always known that music has a powerful
influence on people.
Certainly it has had a profound effect on my life in so many
ways. Music can motivate and energize. It soothes
the soul and can play a prominent part in healing and connection to God, others and our inner self.
In 2008 I released an album entitled “In the Stillness”. 
Songs from that album were nominated in the 2008 GMA-Covenant Awards.
Canadian radio stations currently play tracks from
that album.

I will need your help however to continue. We have recorded 3 of the 7 songs
for the new album and now will need more funds to complete the project.
“Nothing Short of a Miracle” is a special collection of songs
that reflect my heart for God and the title speaks to His greatness, in that, He would save even ""a wretch like me”.
What We Need & What You Get
 Well, putting an album together has various, significant costs.
We will need a bare minimum of $7,500 to complete this project. However,  I have more songs written to record if the provision are there.
More funds, more songs!
Break down
A majority of the funds are taken up with the costs for hired professional, passionate musicians, to play along side me and an award winning producer Andy   Horrocks, all taking place at ""AME Studios"" in Kitchener, ON.
Studio time, production and mastering costs are also significant.
We need to pay for physical copies of the CD and photography for the CD. Promotional costs; there will be a small CD release party tour consisting of 2 or 3 dates at strategically chosen venues and I will need funds to pay musicians for the main concerts.
I will also need to fulfill the perk commitments. The crowdfunding video needs to be paid for and my website desperately needs restructuring so people can easily communicate with me and access music and products.
So please, prayerfully consider getting involved in this project and help spread the love of God through music by ministering to others through songs.
I truly believe that God wants me to get these new songs out for people to hear, for the purpose of drawing people closer to Him with messages of hope, inspiration and truth.
Perks
Please check out all the perk packages. It's my way of giving back and saying thank you with what I have to give with out compromising the main goal. Also, I have been creative and personal so you may know that we are doing this journey together.
Thank you!!!!
    The Impact 

As time has passed, I have had people, through email, through my website and in
person, share with me that particular songs from the ""In the Stillness"" album have brought them
comfort through hard times and that the songs have been a blessing to them and have ministered to them.
That is the type of conformation that is precious and why I continue to do this!
You can help me connect and minister to others with your financial involvement.

Risks
There are no real risks for the project, except that if the goal is not met then there will simply be less songs on the EP. We are already three songs deep. I am trusting God with this project and humbly accepting help from you to go forward.
   Other Ways You Can Help If you find that you can not contribute financially, that doesn't mean you can't help and be involved if you want to. Together let's get the word out and make some noise about the ""Nothing Short of a Miracle"" CD campaign. Be sure to use the Indiegogo share tools!

</h3> <p>Air Mix Virginia has been given the opportunity through the Virginia Radio Co-op to start the first 24-hour, clean Hip-Hop and R&amp;B radio station in Central Virginia. In order to see this dream through to a reality, we need your help. <br/></p>
<p>Since the invention of Hip-Hop in the late 70's, we have seen the art form take on various sounds and personalities.  <b>It is our mission to provide a radio station that represents the entirety of Hip-Hop and R&amp;B music and various related sub-genres.</b>  In addition, we are looking forward to providing a large community involvement aspect  to help educate and inspire our communities. <br/></p>
<p><b>Unlike large corporate run stations, 101.3 JAMZ  is a non-profit station that will not operate as simply a computer playlist.</b>  JAMZ will employ the use of some the best live mix DJ's and on-air personalities.  We strongly believe that it's the people that make a successful radio station.  Our DJ's will be dedicated to bringing you the best mixes and the most current, cutting-edge music.  Our on-air personalities are respectful, articulate, and responsible members of our community, that together form a multi-cultural melting pot that can reach out to many different backgrounds. Additionally, we want the feedback of the community to help us be the best station possible.  <br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
</div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>Air Mix Virginia and The Virginia Radio Co-op have already done a great deal of the dirty work.  A location for the station has been chosen, and the facilities have been remodeled to accommodate our needs.  We are almost there, but in order to bring you the highest quality experience we need a few more things.  That is where you come in!  Your money will be used to purchase the equipment inside our studio to insure your listening experience is top notch!</p>
<p>Here is a short list of equipment needs:</p>
<p></p>
<p><span>1.<span> 
</span></span><b>main
studio computer + soundcard for automation </b>(our main computer that all the
music will be playing from)</p>

</div></div>","What We Are
 Air Mix Virginia has been given the opportunity through the Virginia Radio Co-op to start the first 24-hour, clean Hip-Hop and R&B radio station in Central Virginia. In order to see this dream through to a reality, we need your help. 
Since the invention of Hip-Hop in the late 70's, we have seen the art form take on various sounds and personalities.  It is our mission to provide a radio station that represents the entirety of Hip-Hop and R&B music and various related sub-genres.  In addition, we are looking forward to providing a large community involvement aspect  to help educate and inspire our communities. 
Unlike large corporate run stations, 101.3 JAMZ  is a non-profit station that will not operate as simply a computer playlist.  JAMZ will employ the use of some the best live mix DJ's and on-air personalities.  We strongly believe that it's the people that make a successful radio station.  Our DJ's will be dedicated to bringing you the best mixes and the most current, cutting-edge music.  Our on-air personalities are respectful, articulate, and responsible members of our community, that together form a multi-cultural melting pot that can reach out to many different backgrounds. Additionally, we want the feedback of the community to help us be the best station possible.  

  What We Need & What You Get Air Mix Virginia and The Virginia Radio Co-op have already done a great deal of the dirty work.  A location for the station has been chosen, and the facilities have been remodeled to accommodate our needs.  We are almost there, but in order to bring you the highest quality experience we need a few more things.  That is where you come in!  Your money will be used to purchase the equipment inside our studio to insure your listening experience is top notch!
Here is a short list of equipment needs:

1. 
main
studio computer + soundcard for automation (our main computer that all the
music will be playing from)
2. 
main
studio mixing console (the control board and faders that serves as the ""brain"" of all mics,
computers, and CD players)
3. 
secondary computer (all phone calls,
drops, liners ,and various edits are done on this computer)
4. 
main
audio processor (all audio is routed through this to meet broadcast
standards before being transmitted on the air)
5. 
transmitter
(transmits our signal on the air)
7. 
misc (tower rent, building rent, Co-op expenses to date)
In the event we do not reach our fundraising goal your money will still go towards the eventual launch of 101.3 JAMZ.  We will purchase whatever we can with the money raised from this campaign and look for other fundraising opportunities to reach our goal if it is not met here.

<h3>Who we are?<br/>
</h3>Holy Name of Jesus School (K-8) is located in inner city Los Angeles at the flash point of the 1992 riots. 85% of our school families live below the poverty line based upon the Federal School Lunch Program standards. <br/><p>For 90 years Holy Name of Jesus School has worked diligently to reduce the inequity in educational opportunities for economically disadvantaged children here in South Los Angeles. 98% of our students graduate from High School and 95% enroll in college.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>Why it's important.<br/>
</h3>Music is deeply woven into the culture of Holy Name of Jesus School and is a 
part of every school activity. Our innovative music education program immerses students in both theory and 
application and is taught by professional musicians. Each student learns to read 
music and to play a musical instrument. Students K-3 begin by learning to play piano. Students 
grades 4-8 select drums, woodwinds or brass. <br/><p></p>
<h3>Why we need your help.<br/>
</h3>We provide all the instruments for our students which are donated are donated to the school by various foundations and individuals. While we teach our students how to care for the instruments they do need to be refurbished periodically because of normal wear and tear. This year we find ourselves with an inordinate number of flutes (30)  and trumpets (21) which need to be serviced and/or repaired.  <br/><br/>The funds received during this campaign will be used to assure our instruments are operational for the coming school year (flutes $1900, trumpets $1600).<br/>
</div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3>Holy Name of Jesus School firmly believes that our music program contributes to 
the academic success and intellectual development of our students.<br/>According 
to “Effects of Music Training on Brain and Cognitive Development in 
Under-Privileged 3- to 5-Year-Olds” (Helen Neville, Ph.D., et al University of 
Oregon/Dana Arts and Cognition Consortium research) low income children exposed 
to music on a regular basis “display gains in a number of cognitive areas, 
including language, pre-literacy and visual-spatial skills, numeracy” and 
“produce significant improvements in cognition and school performance”<br/>
</div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>Without your help our music program could be seriously impaired. Most of our students would not be able to participate in this program if the school did not provide the instruments. We have enough instruments, they just need to be serviced.<br/>Charles Music in Glendale, CA has agreed to provide us with deeply discounted servicing rates for which we are very grateful.<br/>

That’s why I am here telling you this story today.</p><p><strong>About <i>Double Mirror</i></strong><br/>I believe everyone needs a mirror to look into, to recognize themselves, to see their flaws and good qualities as they really are. The double mirror is the search for balance. It is the acknowledgement that my heart is divided between my art and real life, between Europe and America. The double mirror reflects my dual nature, strong and weak, determined and lazy, passionate and afraid, and I hope you’ll take interest in it and decide to look into the mirror yourself, see what you'll find!</p><p><i>Double Mirror</i> is not just an album. Rather, it’s an experience, an invitation into the inner self, a journey that starts softly, like falling asleep, and then goes deeper into different, colorful scenarios, each with its own lights and shadows, like walking along an unexplored new path, a fun path that leads to a newly found self and sense of purpose.</p><p>You can take a peek at the 13 songs in the album by visiting the <a href=""https://www.lauracampisi.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Homepage of my brand new website</a>. A preview player is waiting there for you!</p><p><strong>The Making</strong><br/>They say Rome wasn’t built in a day but they never tell how long did it actually take! I guess you never know until you embark on your own creative adventure and face first hand all the bumps in the road…</p><p>Well, <i>Double Mirror</i> took a few years in the making and now I know it couldn’t have sounded as amazing if the process would have been any easier. Through hardship we discover our own value, we challenge our life and overcome our fears, freeing our spirit and accomplishing our human revolution. That is what art should always be about!</p><p>In the process of doing so, I have found I have supporters and friends all over the globe, I have flown to Buenos Aires, Argentina and recorded at a studio that has its own sweat lodge, sang inside a gong and almost broke in tears to bring out my deepest feelings. This is the process of creating and this is what I want you to be a part of.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1494976141/gee2xevhhfjtmgcc5l6g.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><br/>At the studio in Buenos Aires, with Feco Escofet and his gong!</p><p><strong>The Team</strong><br/>Once I decided to put <i>Double Mirror</i> out on my own, after years of feeling like that might actually never happen, I knew there was only one way that would have made it worthy and I told myself: SHOOT FOR THE MOON, GIRL! I determined to go all out and was able to put together a team of truly wonderful professionals to help me do it.</p><p>I got the top notch musicians and engineers, who have put their best art into this musical effort, I got my partner in crime Emilio D.

Rather, it’s an experience, an invitation into the inner self, a journey that starts softly, like falling asleep, and then goes deeper into different, colorful scenarios, each with its own lights and shadows, like walking along an unexplored new path, a fun path that leads to a newly found self and sense of purpose.You can take a peek at the 13 songs in the album by visiting the Homepage of my brand new website. A preview player is waiting there for you!The MakingThey say Rome wasn’t built in a day but they never tell how long did it actually take! I guess you never know until you embark on your own creative adventure and face first hand all the bumps in the road…Well, Double Mirror took a few years in the making and now I know it couldn’t have sounded as amazing if the process would have been any easier. Through hardship we discover our own value, we challenge our life and overcome our fears, freeing our spirit and accomplishing our human revolution. That is what art should always be about!In the process of doing so, I have found I have supporters and friends all over the globe, I have flown to Buenos Aires, Argentina and recorded at a studio that has its own sweat lodge, sang inside a gong and almost broke in tears to bring out my deepest feelings. This is the process of creating and this is what I want you to be a part of.At the studio in Buenos Aires, with Feco Escofet and his gong!The TeamOnce I decided to put Double Mirror out on my own, after years of feeling like that might actually never happen, I knew there was only one way that would have made it worthy and I told myself: SHOOT FOR THE MOON, GIRL! I determined to go all out and was able to put together a team of truly wonderful professionals to help me do it.I got the top notch musicians and engineers, who have put their best art into this musical effort, I got my partner in crime Emilio D. Miler who brought the album to its highest potential, and three promoters who took this CD at heart. I really am surrounded with love and passion!Meet Ameen, Flavio, Greg, Jonathan, Gianluca, 6V, Zach, Giovanni,Andrés, El pantera, Emilio, Ari,Pax and VincentThe PerksI hope you’ll find something that speaks to you out of the fun list of sexy perks I put together! There’s music and art plus the chance to have a chat, a class or a live show with yours truly ;)Look at the four beautiful, original paintings by Pax Paloscia you will get, in the form of cute postcards, when purchasing the Pax Box!The $$$So, what am I going to do with the money you could help me raise, you might ask? I will be perfectly candid with you and tell it as it is: I have two goals in mind. The first one is to pay back the loan I took to get the music and the team together. The second and most crucial one is to have a minimum base to start scheduling a tour to bring Double Mirror live around the States and, who knows, the world.Recorded music is great, but it needs to go live to fully accomplish its mission. The stage is where a song grows, touching different people every night and in so many different ways. I do hope you will help me reach these goals!Please remember that there is no such thing as too little a contribution. Every dollar counts! You can make the difference and I hope you will feel compelled to do so by donating just as much as you want or can, and perhaps inviting you friends to visit this page, learn about Double Mirror and become a part of the family.Every contribution will get a special, public thank you on my Facebook Artist Page, accompanied by a picture of me shining in pure happiness. Send me your FB name if you’d like to be tagged on it!GRAZIE MILLE!Laura PS: Special thanks to my big little brother Simone for creating the beautiful campaign video. Simone is currently working on the official video of Morningside, Double Mirror closing track... Stay tuned!  CD RELEASE PARTY!Great news! Double Mirror will be officially presented to the NYC crowd on July 2 at DROM. Show goes from 8 to 9pm, doors open at 7pm and you can get tickets here. Come join the celebration!",7.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Wet Nose Dogs - Debut Album</h3>
<h3> </h3>
<p>After a ten plus year music career in Nashville, TN, Philip Calder moved back home to South Carolina thinking he would never sing again. Philip longed to take the stage again but life’s circumstances seemed to prevent his return to stage at every turn. In 2016, Philip met a new friend that refused to let his gift lie dormant. His friend forced Philip to sing with him while he played the guitar and they began to cover songs. In 2017 they sparked attention by releasing videos online. Attention began to mount as these videos gained views and likes, and in August of 2017, Philip set out in a journey that would create the band Wet Nose Dogs. Philip contacted a childhood friend, Evan Lee, who had grown into a prominent electric/acoustic guitarist. They decided to begin rehearsing and playing shows. Wet Nose Dogs is now consistently booked at least two months in advance and their momentum continues to build. Their unique take on the genres of Country, Rock, R&amp;B, Southern Rock, Pop, and Hip Hop has broken outside of the traditional box and embodies perfectly the genre of Eclectic Soul…Southern style of course.</p>
<p>This campaign is simple. We are ready to create music Ready to make Wet Nose Dogs a household name. To bring the genre of Southern Soul to life with a mixture of new and old-some country flare meets soulful, bluesy vocals that will leave your soul longing for more! We need funding for the practical purpose of making the album. Typically independent music production can run roughly $2,000 per track on the low end. From studio time for instrumentation, vocals, and back ground vocals, to the mixing and mastering process, it takes time, and time is money. Then there is also pressing and producing physical CD's and securing online distribution. Please take a look at our links to our music, which right now are cover tune and help us leave our mark on the world. You will be able to get a grasp of our vibe and the potential that our original tracks will  bring to the industry. </p>
<p>We have producers and musicians in Nashville ready and eager to help us create this sound and record it, all we need is the green light. Your money turns the light green!!</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>As of now, we are seeking $20,000. What do you get if you contribute? For each investor that contributes, there are perks that you will receive. From a finished product copy of the album, all the way up to executive producer level. Check out the perks section for details!! </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div> </div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Of course, musicians and bands are a dime a dozen and so many make projects that flop, or bands fold for one reason or another. But we believe in our core there is something here. The soulful whaling of Philip Calder grips your spirit and Evan Lee shreds on acoustic and electric and the two of them together are unmatched in their live concert experience with top of the line equipment and live looping that takes their duo to an entirely fuller sound experience. The challenges we will face comes when we do not have label backing. As independent artists we will have to fight to get the music heard and pay radio promoters to get the tunes to radio and beyond.  But we are ready, and we believe the music will speak for itself. </p>

<h3>The Story Behind <i>I Miss You</i>
</h3>
<p>There is a vulnerability that comes with expressing yourself through any art form. Opening yourself up to the criticism of others is never easy, but there is also so much to gain. In opening yourself up you also give people the opportunity  to feel understood and to recognize that their experience and thoughts are not theirs alone. By donating money to this music video, my first music video, you would help me achieve my dream of being a window through which people can see themselves. </p>
<p><i>I Miss You</i></p>
<p><i>I Miss You is the first song that i have played a role in  writing, producing  and engineering. An R&amp;B song with jazz influence, I Miss You is a conversation with yourself, exploring whether the good in a relationship is worth dealing with the bad. Written with a friend, Antonella Ponce, through a process of meshing my own thoughts and feelings together. </i></p>
</div><div>
<h3>Fundraising </h3>
<p>We are looking to raise $3K to make to convey the story of the song with full brevity and beauty. This money will go to camera equipment, location fees, set design, wardrobe, and more. Any little bit counts. We want to give Dana the debut music video that speaks to her story and her style as an artist. Every donation of $10 or above will receive an exclusive link to stream Dana McCoy's debut single for <i>I Miss You</i> when it drops in Spring. Be the first the hear the song and await McCoy's first EP. </p>

<li>McCoy will be performing live at Brooklyn Bazaar on February 17th at the Tigris Records show. You don't want to miss it!</li>
<li>Donate! Be part of this incredible moment and share the video on social media and amongst your friends and family one it has been completed. We wouldn't be able to make this without you!</li>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Bernard Cissa is an amazingly talented <strong>gospel musician from Senegal</strong>. I've been working with him for the past 5 years supporting him in administration and organization.</p>
<p>His music is profound and catchy. It makes you smile and dance, and yet reflect on the deeper things of life. In a context with less than 5% Christians it is not easy to produce Gospel Music, but Cissa is dedicated to his cause and hopes to brighten up our days, and those of his countrymen with a new Gospel Album!</p>
<p>The new album will include a <strong>bonus tracks</strong>: new mixes of several of his best songs in French.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Most of the album will be recorded in our own studio, which will significantly lower the expenses. We plan to buy some new equipment to improve our recording capacities. Some aspects will be recorded in the famous Youssou N'Dour studios here in Dakar. Of course we do need to pay the studio musicians.</p>
<p>The cover will be designed in Senegal, but printed and pressed in Europe to guarantee international quality.</p>
<p>Our perks are of course <strong>MUSIC</strong>! </p>
<p>Be the first to enjoy these new songs, or be a Secret Santa and hep us distribute the album in Senegal!</p>
<p>About 50 % of the budget is designated for recording and the other 50% for post-production.           </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>As an already nationally know artist, this new album will inevitably have an enormous audience in Senegal. It will open doors for Gospel Music to be heard by people unfamiliar with the Gospel. It will generate hope and love in the hearts of many!</p>

<p>ADD ONE ist, mit Verlaub, das kleinste Vokalorchester der Welt. Sie vertonen die Welt direkt beim nächsten Spaziergang. Dabei singen sich die drei gerne durch die verschiedensten Genres, sind mal Rockband, mal Streichertrio, mal Opern – oder Jazzchor. Sie finden Töne für obskure Kriminalgeschichten sowie Reiseanekdoten und erschaffen im nächsten Augenblick Klangsphären so weit wie der Horizont.</p>
<p>ADD ONE nehmen ""Jazz"" wörtlich, verimprovisieren dabei Alicia Keys und Michael Jackson, TokTokTok oder Miles Davis genauso schwungvoll wie ihre eigenen Kompositionen. Wieviel Groove, Soul, Herzblut, Energie, Humor und tiefe Momente diese drei kreativen Stimmen auf die Bühne bringen können – das sollte man (nicht nur) einmal erlebt haben.</p>
<h3><strong>This is ADD ONE</strong></h3>
<p>100% voice * 100% ourselves * 100% groovy * 100% loveable<br/>ADD ONE – ""The Voice thing"", maybe the smallest vocal orchestra in the world (of more than one person) – able to walk on right away and improvise on the world on their journey. Style is no question: Rock band, string trio, opera choir or jazz choir. Music to strange mysteries, mini road movies or sonic spheres as wide as the horizon.</p>
<p>No a cappella comedy in German sense, but Jazz in pure improvisational form, occasionally ""tongue in cheek"".<br/>ADD ONE try on Michael Jackson, Alicia Keys, Tok Tok Tok and Miles Davis as well as on our own compositions.<br/>ADD ONE – 100% an authentic sonic event. Join and enjoy it!</p>

<p>So wie auf dem Bild zur Kampagne zu sehen  könnte sie aussehen und heißen. </p>
<p>""Twilight tones"" ist ein wunderbarer Ausschnitt einer der Stimmungen die wir besingen.</p>
<p>Aber eine CD ist nicht nur harte Arbeit,  sie will auch finanziert werden.</p>
<p>Und dafür brauchen wir EURE Unterstützung! Damit wir euch und alle treuen Fans nicht nur live, sondern auch mit einem hand-und ohrfesten Produkt belohnen können.</p>
<h3><strong>What are we up to?</strong></h3>
<p>Since 2012 we exist as a band,  since 2015 as a trio.   There´s been 3 years of hard work, and a lot of exciting gigs,   now we want to produce our first longplay CD.</p>
<p>It may look like the campaign picture  and may be called ""Twilight tones"",  since this a very good example of the moods we sign about. </p>
<p>But a CD is not only hard work,  it needs financing. This is where YOUR support would come in! So we can give back our fans and supporters  a ""handy"" product on top of your live concerts.</p>
<p>..........</p>
<h3><strong>Was muss finanziert werden?</strong></h3>
<p>Zu einer CD-Produktion gehören nicht nur die <strong>Aufnahmen im Tonstudio</strong>,</p>
<p>zusätzlich möchten wir auch ein <strong>Studiokonzert </strong>veranstalten, um vor Gästen Songs direkt durchzusingen und Live-Stimmung zu haben.</p>
<p>Dann müssen die Aufnahmen<strong> abgemischt, gemastered</strong> (sozusagen endveredelt) und<strong> auf CD gepresst </strong>werden, </p>
<p>aber natürlich gehören auch <strong>Hülle, Cover und das Booklet</strong> dazu, von Fachkräften gestaltet,</p>
<p>und ansprechende <strong>Fotos</strong> von uns.</p>
<p>Nicht zu vergessen, dass die CD dann auch <strong>beworben, vertrieben (Label) </strong>und<strong> bei der GEMA registriert </strong>werden muss.</p>
<p>Mit insgesamt<strong> 6000€  </strong>haben wir sicher noch nicht alles beisammen, kämen aber ein großes Stück weiter.</p>
<h3><strong>What needs financing?</strong></h3>
<p>A CD production not only comprises <strong>recording in the studio</strong>,</p>
<p>we would like to ADD ONE  with a <strong>studio concert</strong>  to perform before guests  and sing the songs in live atmosphere.</p>
<p>Next, the recordings need to be <strong>mixed, mastered and pressed on CD</strong>. </p>
<p>But of course there´s also <strong>package, cover and booklet</strong>, all designed by specialists,</p>
<p>as well as presentable <strong>photos</strong>.</p>
<p>Not to mentioned, the<strong> promotion, label and registration at the</strong> <strong>GEMA.</strong></p>
<p><strong>6000€  </strong>altogether will not cover everything,  yet we would be a big step forward.</p>
<p>..........</p>

<p>ADD ONE spielen gerne live, weil es Spaß macht. Wir singen unsere eigenen Arrangements nicht nur herunter, sondern fügen jedes Mal etwas Neues hinzu.  ADD ONE eben.</p>
<p>Wer uns nicht live gehört hat, dem fällt es jedoch unter Umständen schwer  sich vorzustellen wie das funktioniert.  Und das müssen wir vermitteln, denn neben allem Spaß  leben wir von der Musik.</p>
<p>Darum wollen wir den Schritt ins Studio gehen; um unsere Möglichkeiten bei optimalem Sound und optimaler Betreuung weiterzuentwickeln  und hörbar zu <i>machen</i>.</p>
<p>Ihr tut uns einen riesigen Gefallen wenn wir diese CD realisieren können; auf dass wir gehört werden, für unsere Entwicklung und unser Vorankommen - denn wir bleiben ja bei der CD nicht stehen.</p>
<p>Wir möchten Euch gerne als Dank ein auditives, erwerbbares und online und in den Medien auffindbares Stück (mit mehreren Stücken darauf) von uns mitgeben.</p>
</div><h3>What does your support do for us?</h3><div>
<p>ADD ONE love to play live, because we are musicians and it´s fun.  We add something new to our arrangements every time - which means ADD ONE.</p>
<p>Still;  we live by our music as professionals.  So, we need to explain what we do  also to those who never heard us sing live. </p>
<p>That is why we need the step into the studio;  to explore our possibilities with an optimum of sound and care,  to make it audible.</p>
<p>So;  you´re doing us the greatest of favors  to help us realise this CD;  so we get heard,  we develop and make further steps forward.</p>
<p>We would love to give you an audible, acquirable  and media-presentable piece (including several pieces) of our work.</p>

ADD ONE ist, mit Verlaub, das kleinste Vokalorchester der Welt. Sie vertonen die Welt direkt beim nächsten Spaziergang. Dabei singen sich die drei gerne durch die verschiedensten Genres, sind mal Rockband, mal Streichertrio, mal Opern – oder Jazzchor. Sie finden Töne für obskure Kriminalgeschichten sowie Reiseanekdoten und erschaffen im nächsten Augenblick Klangsphären so weit wie der Horizont.
ADD ONE nehmen ""Jazz"" wörtlich, verimprovisieren dabei Alicia Keys und Michael Jackson, TokTokTok oder Miles Davis genauso schwungvoll wie ihre eigenen Kompositionen. Wieviel Groove, Soul, Herzblut, Energie, Humor und tiefe Momente diese drei kreativen Stimmen auf die Bühne bringen können – das sollte man (nicht nur) einmal erlebt haben.
This is ADD ONE
100% voice * 100% ourselves * 100% groovy * 100% loveableADD ONE – ""The Voice thing"", maybe the smallest vocal orchestra in the world (of more than one person) – able to walk on right away and improvise on the world on their journey. Style is no question: Rock band, string trio, opera choir or jazz choir. Music to strange mysteries, mini road movies or sonic spheres as wide as the horizon.
No a cappella comedy in German sense, but Jazz in pure improvisational form, occasionally ""tongue in cheek"".ADD ONE try on Michael Jackson, Alicia Keys, Tok Tok Tok and Miles Davis as well as on our own compositions.ADD ONE – 100% an authentic sonic event. Join and enjoy it!

Help us complete a new CD to be released in 2018 </strong></p><p><strong>New Yor-Uba is a Musical Celebration of Cuba in America,</strong> led by pianist/composer Michele Rosewoman and featuring masters from the worlds of contemporary jazz and Cuban folkloric music. The name ""New Yor-Uba"" reflects the progression of the music of the ancient Yoruba people from Nigeria through Cuba to present day New York.</p><p>With this group of amazingly creative <i>and</i> tradition-drenched voices we are on a journey to discover all that is possible within the concept of this ensemble-- a concept that is constantly expanding. I am endlessly intrigued and excited by these two profound musical idioms- the worlds of Jazz and Afro Cuban folklore are bottomless wells of possibility.</p><p>Thanks to so many of you, four years ago we recorded and released our 30-year anniversary <strong>debut</strong> recording as a double disc CD. Many of you graciously shared with me that you were personally and deeply moved by the music. We received great press and numerous awards including NPR's #1 Latin jazz recording of the year.  </p><p>These days, we are deep in a new phase of our journey. Through this campaign I am seeking your support to help fund the completion of a new CD, half of which was was recorded in late August with support from a prestigious catalyst grant from Chamber Music America (CMA). The monies raised through this campaign will enable us to go back in the studio and complete the recording at the end of this month (October).</p><p>To conceive a thoroughly uncompromised synthesis of spiritually based Cuban Folkloric music and contemporary jazz concept, I have spent a lifetime immersed in the essence of these two profound musical traditions.  Recently, the deepening of my approach prepared me on multiple levels to manifest a new and challenging composition.  Commissioned by CMA, my latest work, ""Oru de Oro"" has been well-received by audiences at an array of venues including festivals, cultural centers and clubs such as the D.C. Jazz Festival and Dizzy’s at Jazz at Lincoln Center and was recorded in the studio in late August.</p><p>This extended new work honors the mastery of folkorist <strong>Roman Diaz,</strong> a featured member of the New Yor-Uba ensemble since 2008.  A body of music, built around a sacred sequence of rhythms known as the Oru Seco, ""Oru de Oro"", roughly translates as ""room of gold"" or ""sacred room."" Compositionally, the work is anchored in the rhythmic patterns associated with various  Orishas (deities), endowing them with unique musical content, while  integrating featured soloists and master drummers. As you will hear from my esteemed colleagues in the video, the work is  considered adventurous and pioneering. ""Oru de Oro"" will be presented on the CD as separate tracks, although artistically it can be heard as one uninterrupted rhythmic suite.</p><p>Other repertoire for the recording will include ""Alabanza"" (a recent composition for which I received a Latin Grammy as pianist and composer as represented on Arturo O'Farrill's ALJO recording). We will also be recording an arrangement of a sequence of traditional rezos (prayers) and cantos (songs) featuring Nina Rodriguez on lead vocals--a voice of true beauty.</p><p>For this upcoming second and final phase of the recording, we are scheduled to return to the studio in late October. But for this, we need your help!</p><p>In honor of my mentor and inspiration, New Yor-Uba works are dedicated to celebrating the legacy of master folklorist <strong>Orlando 'Puntilla' Rios</strong> who nurtured the birth of the ensemble and was an integral member for 25 years-- from our 1983 debut until his passing in 2008.</p><p>Our extensive history was amply documented in our previous Kickstarter campaign video which you can view if interested.

Join our 35th Anniversary Celebration. Help us complete a new CD to be released in 2018 New Yor-Uba is a Musical Celebration of Cuba in America, led by pianist/composer Michele Rosewoman and featuring masters from the worlds of contemporary jazz and Cuban folkloric music. The name ""New Yor-Uba"" reflects the progression of the music of the ancient Yoruba people from Nigeria through Cuba to present day New York.With this group of amazingly creative and tradition-drenched voices we are on a journey to discover all that is possible within the concept of this ensemble-- a concept that is constantly expanding. I am endlessly intrigued and excited by these two profound musical idioms- the worlds of Jazz and Afro Cuban folklore are bottomless wells of possibility.Thanks to so many of you, four years ago we recorded and released our 30-year anniversary debut recording as a double disc CD. Many of you graciously shared with me that you were personally and deeply moved by the music. We received great press and numerous awards including NPR's #1 Latin jazz recording of the year.  These days, we are deep in a new phase of our journey. Through this campaign I am seeking your support to help fund the completion of a new CD, half of which was was recorded in late August with support from a prestigious catalyst grant from Chamber Music America (CMA). The monies raised through this campaign will enable us to go back in the studio and complete the recording at the end of this month (October).To conceive a thoroughly uncompromised synthesis of spiritually based Cuban Folkloric music and contemporary jazz concept, I have spent a lifetime immersed in the essence of these two profound musical traditions.  Recently, the deepening of my approach prepared me on multiple levels to manifest a new and challenging composition.  Commissioned by CMA, my latest work, ""Oru de Oro"" has been well-received by audiences at an array of venues including festivals, cultural centers and clubs such as the D.C. Jazz Festival and Dizzy’s at Jazz at Lincoln Center and was recorded in the studio in late August.This extended new work honors the mastery of folkorist Roman Diaz, a featured member of the New Yor-Uba ensemble since 2008.  A body of music, built around a sacred sequence of rhythms known as the Oru Seco, ""Oru de Oro"", roughly translates as ""room of gold"" or ""sacred room."" Compositionally, the work is anchored in the rhythmic patterns associated with various  Orishas (deities), endowing them with unique musical content, while  integrating featured soloists and master drummers. As you will hear from my esteemed colleagues in the video, the work is  considered adventurous and pioneering. ""Oru de Oro"" will be presented on the CD as separate tracks, although artistically it can be heard as one uninterrupted rhythmic suite.Other repertoire for the recording will include ""Alabanza"" (a recent composition for which I received a Latin Grammy as pianist and composer as represented on Arturo O'Farrill's ALJO recording). We will also be recording an arrangement of a sequence of traditional rezos (prayers) and cantos (songs) featuring Nina Rodriguez on lead vocals--a voice of true beauty.For this upcoming second and final phase of the recording, we are scheduled to return to the studio in late October. But for this, we need your help!In honor of my mentor and inspiration, New Yor-Uba works are dedicated to celebrating the legacy of master folklorist Orlando 'Puntilla' Rios who nurtured the birth of the ensemble and was an integral member for 25 years-- from our 1983 debut until his passing in 2008.Our extensive history was amply documented in our previous Kickstarter campaign video which you can view if interested.

The illustrations come from 9 artists including Alan Coulson the portrait artist and a 14 year old, Taylor Campbell, whose illustrations we loved on Instagram.</p><p>In addition we asked 5 poets and 7 photographers to contribute a response to, or interpretation of the lyrics.

<h3>WHO IS <strong>GIO NATION</strong>?</h3>
<p>Gionatan Niro (a.k.a. <strong>Gio Nation</strong>) is an American singer-songwriter, dancer, and fire artist. <br/><br/>Though he has been performing since he was a child, it wasn't until 2014 that Gio packed up everything he owned and moved from Richmond, Virginia, to Los Angeles. Since then, he has developed a reputation as one of LA's (literally) hottest performers. With his new single ""Gymnast"" coming out this May, Gio is finally ready to unleash his personal creative vision and establish himself as a major recording artist. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>
<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1517447896/dahycoegpld9wusxr1ni.jpg"" src=""""/><br/><br/>WHAT WE NEED TO MAKE ""GYMNAST"" COME TO LIFE</h3>
<p>Our music video is a passionate chase across three different locations: An intimate cabaret, a Burning Man-style desert camp, and a rollicking house party overlooking Los Angeles. These diverse settings eventually collide, with Victorian chorus girls brushing up alongside fire-eating ravers and WeHo club kids. In order to realize this concept completely, we need your donations to help our budget cover the following: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Camera/Lighting Equipment Rental</strong> <b>($2,000)</b><br/>We would never create anything that is less than the best, which means shelling out for some expensive tech. Two thousand immediately goes to covering our lighting equipment, our Steadicam, and an array of speciality lenses for filming in slow-motion and low-light settings. </li>
<li>
<strong>Cast &amp; Crew ($2,000)</strong><br/>Though almost everybody involved in ""Gymnast"" is working for free due to their passion for this project, we still need to pay certain crew people: Our Steadicam operator, gaffer, grip, best boy, and more. Additionally, we need to both feed and transport dozens of extras during the shoot.</li>
<li>
<strong>Post-production ($1,000)</strong><br/>Once filming is complete, we've already lined up some incredible sound engineers and color correction specialists to make sure ""Gymnast"" looks/sounds as good as anything you might see on MTV...or in this day and age, Vevo.  </li>
<li>
<strong>Location Rentals ($4,000)</strong><br/>Our biggest outright cost is locations. We are filming ""Gymnast"" at some astonishing locales: An elite Hollywood nightclub, a beautiful desert vista, and a hilltop mansion. But rental and permit costs run high, even for our jam-packed shooting schedule. Every last penny of what we spend will be obvious on screen. </li>

<p><br/>Looks pretty amazing, right?! Who <i>wouldn't</i> toss a few bucks our way?!<br/><br/>So donate today for a chance to <strong>be in the music video </strong>or even receive a <strong>private concert from Gio Nation<i> </i></strong>and his band! We can't wait to share our art with you!</p>
</div><div><h3>THANK YOU FOR DONATING!</h3></div></div>","WHO IS GIO NATION?
Gionatan Niro (a.k.a. Gio Nation) is an American singer-songwriter, dancer, and fire artist. Though he has been performing since he was a child, it wasn't until 2014 that Gio packed up everything he owned and moved from Richmond, Virginia, to Los Angeles. Since then, he has developed a reputation as one of LA's (literally) hottest performers. With his new single ""Gymnast"" coming out this May, Gio is finally ready to unleash his personal creative vision and establish himself as a major recording artist. 


WHAT WE NEED TO MAKE ""GYMNAST"" COME TO LIFE
Our music video is a passionate chase across three different locations: An intimate cabaret, a Burning Man-style desert camp, and a rollicking house party overlooking Los Angeles. These diverse settings eventually collide, with Victorian chorus girls brushing up alongside fire-eating ravers and WeHo club kids. In order to realize this concept completely, we need your donations to help our budget cover the following: 


Camera/Lighting Equipment Rental ($2,000)We would never create anything that is less than the best, which means shelling out for some expensive tech. Two thousand immediately goes to covering our lighting equipment, our Steadicam, and an array of speciality lenses for filming in slow-motion and low-light settings. 

Cast & Crew ($2,000)Though almost everybody involved in ""Gymnast"" is working for free due to their passion for this project, we still need to pay certain crew people: Our Steadicam operator, gaffer, grip, best boy, and more. Additionally, we need to both feed and transport dozens of extras during the shoot.

Post-production ($1,000)Once filming is complete, we've already lined up some incredible sound engineers and color correction specialists to make sure ""Gymnast"" looks/sounds as good as anything you might see on MTV...or in this day and age, Vevo.  

Location Rentals ($4,000)Our biggest outright cost is locations. We are filming ""Gymnast"" at some astonishing locales: An elite Hollywood nightclub, a beautiful desert vista, and a hilltop mansion. But rental and permit costs run high, even for our jam-packed shooting schedule. Every last penny of what we spend will be obvious on screen. 


OUR TEAM
Leland Frankel (Director)Leland is an LA-based, award-winning playwright, screenwriter, and director. His projects have been produced across the country, from New York City to Kealakekua. He is also the Artistic Director and co-founder of Shinbone Theatre Company. Leland is currently in pre-production for his feature debut Frontera, to be filmed in 2019. LelandFrankel.com
Gemini Musiq (Producer)Gemini Musiq is an LA-based producer with 25 years of experience and multiple platinum-selling albums to his name. He has won a Grammy Award for his sound engineering collaboration with Justin Bieber, and is credited on projects by Lil John, Christina Milian, and many more. GeminiMusiq.comJohn Ros (Cinematographer)John is a co-founder of Subplot Entertainment. He has shot concert footage for Rihanna and Kendrick Lamar, music videos for artists like Will Haynes and D'Cipher, commercials for Time Warner Cable and 7-Eleven, and television shows like ""KMG! Show"" and ""Jet Set! Philippines!"" InPlotWeTrust.com


WHY SHOULD YOU DONATE?
Maybe you want to support the creation of dynamic multi-ethnic music. Maybe you love electric jazz positive pop jams that are equally awesome in the car, on the speakers at a party, or on your headphones at the gym. Maybe you're secretly in love with Gio and for some reason this is the only way you can think of to express your uncompromising desire. Or maybe you caught a glimpse of our locations/performers and needed to see this video come to life:
Location 1: The Crazy Sexy Cabaret

Location 2: The Fire Festival

Location 3: The Quintessential Hollywood Hills Party

Looks pretty amazing, right?! Who wouldn't toss a few bucks our way?!So donate today for a chance to be in the music video or even receive a private concert from Gio Nation and his band! We can't wait to share our art with you!

<h3>Who the heck is Karen Wheelock? </h3>
<p>Madison’s 2015 New Artist of the Year Karen Wheelock burst into the local folk and americana scene in 2013, armed with a guitar and a ukulele. A Wisconsin farm girl from the small town of Delavan, Wheelock’s gentle heart and forthright nature are surprisingly disarming to even the most jaded audience.<br/><br/>Romantic at its core, Wheelock’s music has a sound all its own, but one could draw connections to A Fine Frenzy, Lisa Loeb, Cat Power with just a hint of the Moldy Peaches' spirit. Hidden within her songwriting is a deep love for the Foo Fighters and other hard rock bands. Wheelock's repertoire ranges from light-hearted ditties to deeply profound ballads; these are clearly the result of personal reflection, the stuff of all good art.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Why does Karen need this campaign?</h3>
<p>Because making a record is not cheap! Besides paying for the EP to be recorded and produced, I need to pay for merch, marketing, copyrighting, etc. Also, I'd love to be able to compensate the talented musicians backing me up on this EP - they deserve it! </p>
<p>I feel like the experiential perks are the most exciting and memorable! A private concert, a spot on a radio show, your favorite cover song...these aren't things you see every day! :)</p>
<p>Obviously, I hope to reach the goal of $1500, but if I don't, I will put the money into the production of the album first and compensate my backup musicians before making the merch. </p>

<p>I know some of you might not be able to financially contribute to this campaign, but you can help get the word out! Please share this with others! Word of mouth can work wonders :) </p>
<p>Thank you <strong>SO MUCH</strong> for the support! &lt;3</p>
<p><strong><i>EP RELEASE SHOW WILL BE ON 12/27 AT BOS MEADERY. WE WILL HAVE THE ITEMS AVAILABLE FOR PICKUP THEN. PLEASE SPECIFY IF YOU CANNOT MAKE IT AND WE CAN MAKE ARRANGEMENTS OR MAIL YOUR ITEMS.</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>**Edit: I had put shipping charges on the perks with physical products, thinking it was an optional check box (if you wanted to pick it up from me, I obviously wouldn't charge shipping), but I've realized the charges became mandatory, and I can't undo it on some of them. If you see something you like and know that you will be able to pick it up from me, please make a general contribution, tell me which perk you want and I'll get it to you!! (That way, you'll avoid shipping fees). If you already paid shipping fees and come to pick up your merch, I can reimburse you! Thank you! </i></strong></p>

<p><u><strong>'Felabration 20 Years On: Promoting, Preserving &amp; Protecting the Legacy of Fela Anikulapo- Kuti'.</strong></u></p>
<p><strong>Welcome to Phase Two* of our Crowdfunding Campaign: Second Base Jare!</strong></p>
<p>This year marks 20 years since Fela passed and we want to make 2017 the very best Felabration yet to truly honour his legacy for this generation and the next. We plan to raise <i><strong>$128,000</strong> </i>by Fela’s birthday on 15th October 2017, so we need your help!</p>
<p>The last few years have been a challenge financially for the organisation, as festival related costs have increased due to a number of complex factors. As the year has gone on, we have continued to plan for the festival, however, it’s become apparent that we will be unable to fully achieve our goals without the help and support of Fela’s global community. </p>
<p>We do however feel optimistically confident that within this global community there are the resources to achieve our goal. No donation is too small or too large, all support is truly welcome.  </p>
<p>Your donation will help defray the costs associated with artists’ travel, lodging, sound, security, and all other festival associated expenses as well as seed the development of an archive for Fela in Lagos, Nigeria.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Phase Two- Second Base Jare</strong></p>
<p>We ran our very first Crowdfunding campaign on IndieGogo from 15th July-11th September 2017. Our phase one campaign can be viewed at: <a href=""https://igg.me/at/CrowdfundFela"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://igg.me/at/CrowdfundFela</a></p>
<p>We were fortunate to have gained support from a total of 22 individual backers, who together raised a total of $2122 for our campaign! To the inaugural backers of our campaign, we salute and thank you for your belief in our mission. In fact we'd like to thank you personally, each and everyone of you. Drum roll please!</p>
<p>Anonymous $5, Anonymous $20, Hamida Yusufzai $25, Erin Glasco $61, Adelaide Bannerman $32, Anonymous $35, Anonymous $108, Jaime Delmer $100, Brenda Langton $61, Shilps2 $10, MaryBeth Szeles $61, Aya Ifakemi Yem $20, Rob Eagle $15, Conyemelukwe $40, Sophie Akehurst $32, Hannah Ishmael $17, Anonymous $10, Dotun Adebayo $150, Stephen Hendel $1000, Page and Jay Cowles $300, Anonymous $10, Ayodeji Soboyede $10. </p>
<p>We raised a total of $2122 (before platform fees) from our first phase and it’s spurned us on even further to reach our ultimate goal. That means we would still like to raise $128,000. So we've launched phase two and are calling upon you to support our campaign. </p>
<p>Please visit our image gallery for images from our phase one campaign. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong><u>The Archive</u></strong></p>
<p>Your donation will ensure the preservation of the existing Fela Anikulapo-Kuti archive, which is currently held at The New Afrika Shrine and The Kalakuta Museum both based in Ikeja, Lagos, Nigeria. </p>
<p>Fela’s collection includes, photographs of family members pre-dating his musical career, charting his musical career at home and abroad, a variety of musical ephemera including recordings and album art, personal correspondence and hand written/typed lyrics, clothing and musical instruments.</p>
<p>Your support will enable the delivery of a much needed assessment, that identifies preservation priorities of the Fela Anikulapo-Kuti collection. We will be addressing the urgent issues the collection currently faces, as it deteriorates under a number of factors including weather, limited intervention and collection management.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><u><strong>Felabration</strong></u></p>
<p>Felabration was a tribute conceived by Yeni Anikulapo -Kuti, Fela’s eldest child, as a festival celebrating the life of her father. Established in 1998, the year after he had passed away; Felabration has grown from a day of celebration and remembrance into a week long Superfest, which was recognised and listed by Fest300 in 2016/17. In 2011 Felabration was endorsed by Lagos State Government and was included on their events calendar. </p>
<p>Each year we host an audience of over a million people globally, including 30,000 in Nigeria who get to see us live!</p>

all!</p>
<p><span>My
name's Matt, and my friend Nick recently had his guitar stolen. He absolutely loves
nothing more than to shred his guitar, and to play music in general. However,
he isn’t in a position where he can afford a new one. To see his instrument
taken from him is absolutely heartbreaking. Not only does it deprive my friend
of one of the things he loves most in the world, but it deprives the world of
awesome guitar playing. </span></p>
<p>So,
in order to provide the world with awesome guitar playing again, I thought I would
start this and raise money to get my friend, a truly gifted guitarist, a new
guitar.</p>
<p>What
we need is approximately $750. Above that would be awesome! All the money,
whether we reach the target or not, will go to Nick for his new guitar. Even if
we don’t manage to reach the goal, it’s still a start, and will provide so much
hope.</p>
<p>Nick loves nothing more than bringing joy to this world through this guitar playing.</p><p>So
please contribute to getting a young musician back on his feet.</p>
<p>Check
out the video to get a sample of Nick’s guitar playing. For more check out his YouTube

all!
My
name's Matt, and my friend Nick recently had his guitar stolen. He absolutely loves
nothing more than to shred his guitar, and to play music in general. However,
he isn’t in a position where he can afford a new one. To see his instrument
taken from him is absolutely heartbreaking. Not only does it deprive my friend
of one of the things he loves most in the world, but it deprives the world of
awesome guitar playing. 
So,
in order to provide the world with awesome guitar playing again, I thought I would
start this and raise money to get my friend, a truly gifted guitarist, a new
guitar.
What
we need is approximately $750. Above that would be awesome! All the money,
whether we reach the target or not, will go to Nick for his new guitar. Even if
we don’t manage to reach the goal, it’s still a start, and will provide so much
hope.
Nick loves nothing more than bringing joy to this world through this guitar playing.So
please contribute to getting a young musician back on his feet.
Check
out the video to get a sample of Nick’s guitar playing. For more check out his YouTube

<h2><b>WHO IS DESCHAMP?</b></h2>
<p><span>Hi everyone! I'm RICKY! Deschamp. Some of you know me as the lead singer of Head Casket or even (as seen on tv) American Idol Season 11, or you might not know me at all, but thats okay, here’s a bit about myself. I was born in the Philippines and grew up in Santa Cruz, CA. I was raised on Sinatra, and skateboarding, but my love for all things music pushed me to write songs, play guitar, and form bands. </span></p>
<p>Now i live in the amazingly talented and supportive Spokane/Coeur d'Alene area, and in the past two years i branched out on a solo career. Teaming up with the record label FM Inc. and the amazing music scene we have here, I am about to release my DEBUT (full length) ALBUM “Hilarious, Fun, and Sexy.” featuring SUPER CATCHY, hilarious, fun, and sexy songs that will keep you humming along during your week.</p>
<h2>WHY FUND ME?</h2>
<p>I love doing this! And I do it for YOU, MY FANS. I want to get my music to more fans, and to see them all in person, sooner than later, so that’s where you come in.</p>
<p>I need your support….. Being signed to an indie label is amazing but its also a lot of work on my end. FM Inc. is funding the FULL PRODUCTION of the album (studio time, producing, mastering, studio musicians, and copyrights) which is awesome! However, I am responsible for getting my record out to YOU and the nation.</p>
<p>To get a successful album going, it takes more than a tour and a catchy song alone, it takes:</p>
<p><b>- Advertising</b></p>
<p><b>- Full PR</b></p>
<p><b>- Physical Duplication of the CD</b></p>
<p><b>- Music Videos</b></p>
<p><b>- More Advertising</b></p>
<p><b>- Merchandise (shirts, hoodies, stickers, buttons)</b></p>
<p><b>- Digital Distrubution </b></p>
<p><b>- Magazine Interviews</b></p>
<p><b>- Album Reviews</b></p>
<p><b>- Touring Expenses (gas, cheap food, lodging, or I can crash on you couch;-) )</b></p>
<p><b>- And yes MORE ADVERTISING</b></p>
<p>If WE hit this goal of 27k, the faster I can be with YOU, in YOUR town, playing YOUR FAVORITE venue, eating at your favorite RESTURANT, and even SKATING your favorite park. Without your help, we are still doing all of this but that would  take much longer. </p>
<p>I love playing music for all of you. I love new audiences singing along without ever hearing my song before. I am determined to give the audience an experience they can take home with them. Hilarious, Fun, and Sexy, is who I am and I want the world to be Hilarious, Fun, and Sexy too.</p>

All perks are still valid!!!!Imagine this...An iconic studio...A world class orchestra...An award-winning team...


The piano in the picture above is where my musical journey started when I began playing the piano at the age of four. ""Twinkle Twinkle Little Star"" was my first song. That piano is still at my parents' home in London, England and very, very out of tune. 
Beneath that is a picture of one of the highlights along this journey: conducting the London Symphony Orchestra at Abbey Road Studios. 
My music has taken me literally around the world and I have now travelled to more than sixty-five countries. 


PLEASE HELP ME TO MAKE THIS DREAM A REALITY


About three years ago I began working on this project which is the fulfillment of the dream of a lifetime. The album, It Is Well with My Soul, will feature myself at the piano accompanied by eighty members of the incredible London Symphony Orchestra. There are also a number of award-winning special guests who are collaborating on this album which is a cinematic-style journey through songs of the Christian faith. Two years ago, we
recorded the orchestra’s performances at the most famous studio complex in the
world, Abbey Road Studios in London, England. 



We need your help to finish this project
This is by far the most ambitious endeavour that I have ever been a part of and we are now approaching the final stages. My team and I hope to finish production towards the end of this year. Through various sources of funding, we have managed to get this far in the project and now we are asking for your help. 
As you can imagine, recording a stellar 80-piece orchestra at such a famous venue is quite a tall order. The sum of $9,500 that we are aiming to raise through Indiegogo is a significant portion of the remaining budgetary needs of this production and will go a long way towards helping us complete the rest of the production. 
There is still much to be done. 


Recording the orchestra was just one part of this project.The most urgent need now is to
finish recording the guest artists in order to complete the album in time for this year's holiday season. Here are some of the areas where the money will be spent:


Guest artist performances
Instrument overdubs and programming
Mixing
Mastering
Graphic Design
CD manufacturing and duplication 

Your donation of any amount would help meet these needs and help with the outstanding production costs as we near completion.




Thank you for your support
When you give towards this project, we would like to offer you some exciting rewards ranging from autographed, limited edition CDs to private concerts to custom musical arrangements and many, many more.  Perks will also be
added throughout the campaign, so please come back for updates!  If you are unable to donate at this time, please share this project with others. With your help we can spread the word and reach our goal.

<p><b>Beautiful News...</b><br/></p>
<p>Dear friends, my name is Zéna and I play the Kora, a 21-string harp from West Africa. For the past eight years I have followed a journey that has led me around the U.S., Africa and Europe, to learn the classical string music of my ancestors. </p>

<p>From the beaches of the Gambia to the streets of Paris, I have studied with  Kora masters from around the world, most recently including Grammy Award winning Kora master Toumani Diabate of Mali. It is through these  teachers that I am continuing to learn the Jaliyaa tradition of storytelling through music.  </p>

<p>...and I rarely played music publicly. I judged myself harshly and didn't like my voice, so I decided not to share it.

<p>My first Kora album ""Beautiful News"" is an assemblage of lullabies: sounds and stories of finding my place in geography, memory and resilience, that I have written in my travels and kept in my heart for safe keeping all of these years.

My songs are about migration and movement...what we accumulate in our journey from one point to another, how we change and what we lose in the crossing. <b>This album is my chance to share them with the world...       </b><b style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">               </b></p>

 The Project
I  will be recording ""Beautiful News"" at Tiny Telephone Studios in San Francisco from October 12-15 with conductor Minna Choi, composer Schuyler Karr and members of the Magik Magik Orchestra that include an upright bassist, cellist, violinist and clarinetist Natalie Parker (Principal Clarinet of the San Francisco Ballet).

We will be recording exclusively to analog tape ( Tiny Telephone doesn't do computers except as a backup), that will catch the beauty and imperfection of each moment. And just as the tradition of Classical music goes, I will have a wonderful conductor in the studio leading the chamber orchestra through each song. I think when you treat music with this amount of attention and love, it shows and you will feel it when you listen!

My budget to cover the costs of the five-day recording session, string quartet arrangements of my songs and musicians fees is $6,000. I've saved $2,000, so I'll need to raise a minimum of $4,000 with this campaign to afford the first phase of the project.

<p>My name is Connor Roy. I am a 20 year old Contemporary Christian Singer/Songwriter born in Arizona, raised in Downriver Michigan, and currently majoring in Music Production at the University of Valley Forge in Phoenixville, PA! I have always had a passion for music and most importantly my relationship with my Lord &amp; Savior Jesus Christ! <br/><br/>God gave me inspiration as to what my next album would be and He told me to record a Hymns album! </p>
<p>I want YOU to be a part of what could be the next great set of worship songs for the church to sing! What YOU can do is help by supporting this project through any amount of money. The most important thing you can do is pray for this project to reach those who need to hear these songs. </p>
<p>I realize I have done this in the past and it has not worked out but I am approaching this differently. This money is ultimately helping me to advance the Kingdom of God. The glory goes to God! John 3:30 says, ""He must become greater; I must become less."" This project is not about me. It's about bring glory to the Creator of the universe. It's about a new approach to worship.</p>
<p>I have come to realize that many modern-day churches have, for the most part, forgotten about the worship songs of the past. These songs were called, ""hymns."" These have some of the greatest and deepest lyrics of any worship songs that have been written. This project is about taking those great lyrics and expanding on them with modern worship music and a modern feel and bringing some of our greatest worship songs back to life again. It's time for the church to wake up! To sing a new song! Some of the songs on this project will have some new lyrics added. Some will stay the same but with a new melody line. Nonetheless, it's time for these songs to be sung again. </p>
<p>""There's a new song arising in the hearts of God's children,"" as Darrel Evans said.</p>
<p>""He put a new song in my mouth, a HYMN of praise to our God. Many will see and fear the Lord and put their trust in Him.""       Psalm 40:3</p>
<p></p> </div> <div> <h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p></p>I realize $8,000 is a lot of money these days. This money is going to go to the expensive costs of recording an album. This money will also cover the expensive costs of production which will help the CD to look its very best and as professional as it can look. I will be offering some unique items which you can get in return for your support. If I don't reach the entire goal, I still plan to use as much as possible for recording this new project. But in any case, I need your help to spread the word to your friends and family. If lets say 600 of my Facebook fans were to donate $10 that would be $6,000. In other words, a little goes a long way. Don't feel bad if all you have is $1. Every little bit helps. If you cannot donate at all, that's ok with me. Ultimately, all glory goes to God! And if you read this then thank you for your time. What you can do is spread the word to others. </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p></p>Like I said, every bit helps. You could be helping to support the next great set of worship songs for the church to sing. But I cannot record the songs without the funds needed! </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p> </p>To make the most out of your dollar(s), I will be sure to spend as much time working on this project as possible to make it the best not only for God but for you as well as all who hear the songs I've been working on. I'm currently writing for this album what I think are some of my strongest songs yet. </div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p></p>
</div>Ultimately, prayer is the best thing. On top of that, help spread the word to your friends and family! You can also use Indiegogo's Sharing Tools and share this project on Facebook, Twitter, and/or any other social media sites which you use regularly.<p></p></div>","Short Summary

70% funding means we probably break even after buying the food and drink
90% funding means the bands get hotel rooms
100% funding means that the bands get paid, even if the amount is only a very modest fee. And we will do something special (like a raffle or a CD give away or t shirts give away or patches.)
But please remember:We want to pay the artists (or at least pay for their travel costs and accommodation)  and this is where you come into it.
Please help by choosing from the ""Perks"" or donate either additionally or as supporter to be a part of it all.Thank you to everyone who has already contributed and we (the bands, the DJs and snowwy) are looking forward to seeing you all and celebrate together!We have a 40th Birthday party going on too ... 
Please bring a tin or a box of cat food to donate to the cats charity of your choice!(we will put down a suggestion sheet as to where it should go to)

play the mini – then hook 'em together and blow everyone's mind!

</p>
<p>The Gorsuch Magnetic Double Neck isn't just some novelty (although it is fun to see a whole audience go ""WTF!"" at once!), it's a first class, hand-built, tour-ready machine!</p>

 be released, no matter what the outcome of this campaign might be. But 
the more
 you help us out with funds, the better the final product will be! Your 
help will, in fact, decide upon the quality of mix and mastering - two 
very important phases of music production. In return, you will receive 
exclusive merchandise and downloads. Take your
 time and look at all the amazing perks or read the story of the saga 
down below.<br/><p></p>

</div><div> <p></p>Just to make it clear: We are not asking you to completely fund our two new 
recordings. We invite you to help us out and ease the burden on our 
shoulders (or/and purses). Regardless of the outcome of this 
crowdfunding campaign, we are going to pay the recording from our
 own finances. In fact, we are already in the process of recording.<br/><br/>The big thing that is yet to come is the final <b>mix </b>and <b>mastering</b>.
 Mixing and mastering are two processes of music production that add 
even more power and personality to the overall sound by boosting certain
 frequencies and arranging the tracks
 in a way that they are enjoyable for the listener. Obviously, these 
services are quite costly.<br/>
<br/>This is where we really do need your help! We are being honest here, 
with our remaining budget we cannot afford the high quality sound that 
we aim for - and you <b>people deserve the perfect mix</b> too! With 
4,000€ from this campaign we would be able to pull
 this whole thing off in a very satisfying way. If we made less than 
that amount, we would have to go for a cheaper engineer than desired. On
 the other hand, if you help us to raise even more, the mix will be 
absolutely top notch and beyond our own imagination.<br/>
<br/>Of course, you will get <b>great items</b> in return. For hours (if not 
days) we gathered ideas and came up with this outstanding list of 
compensations. Take your time and <b>pick your favorite perk</b>!<p></p>

Magia: how we make magic





My name is Nikolett. I'm from Budapest, Hungary, based in New York for the past 5 years. Throughout this period I’ve been introduced to many different cultures from all over the world. Being away from my country has made me realize how important it is to connect with my roots which inspired the recording of my first studio album.

My producer/arranger, Juancho Herrera has interconnected Hungarian melodies with South American rhythms. I picked songs for the album that had a very important role in my life. We recorded folk songs collected by Bela Bartok, Zoltan Kodaly, melodies made famous by Hungarian actress/singer Katalin Karady and an original composition. All tracks were arranged by Juancho Herrera and myself.
The album's title Magia/Mágia, which means magic in both Hungarian and Spanish, connects the two cultures as we explore each other’s music. I'm going to sing in Hungarian, Spanish and English.

Musicians on my record:Nikolett Pankovits - vocalsJuancho Herrera - guitarJason Lindner - pianoJohn Benitez - upright bassZach Brock - violinAdriano Santos - drums, percussionYayo Serka - drums, percussionJosh Deutsch - trumpetGreg Tardy - tenor saxophoneEdward Perez - upright bass   Join me on my journey by:

We are greatly informed by the music traditions of the MIddle East, Turkey, North Africa, and Latin America. Celebrating 10 years as an active part of Austin’s world music and jazz communities, we were recently named Creative Ambassadors to the City of Austin for 2019. To date we've recorded 5 studio recordings, and has toured internationally in France, Spain, and Turkey. </p><p> </p><p>On May 3rd, 2019 Atlas Maior released the album RIPTIDE after 2 years of diligent work, amidst a series of challenges and financial obstacles . The initial mission was accomplished, but the need for support still exists as we hope to truly fulfill our obligations as Creative Ambassadors to the City of Austin.   </p><p> </p><p>Atlas Maior has toured several times in Europe, starting in Turkey, then later in Spain and France.

We are greatly informed by the music traditions of the MIddle East, Turkey, North Africa, and Latin America. Celebrating 10 years as an active part of Austin’s world music and jazz communities, we were recently named Creative Ambassadors to the City of Austin for 2019. To date we've recorded 5 studio recordings, and has toured internationally in France, Spain, and Turkey.  On May 3rd, 2019 Atlas Maior released the album RIPTIDE after 2 years of diligent work, amidst a series of challenges and financial obstacles . The initial mission was accomplished, but the need for support still exists as we hope to truly fulfill our obligations as Creative Ambassadors to the City of Austin.    Atlas Maior has toured several times in Europe, starting in Turkey, then later in Spain and France. With this year’s Creative Ambassadors award, and the release of album RIPTIDE, we realized that this year is a unique opportunity to have a larger impact overseas, and to truly bridge the gap between the music communities of Angers, France, and Barcelona, Spain; the two cities that Atlas Maior interacts with consistently, and have become the sites of numerous cross-cultural collaborations. These moments of sharing, and learning over the past 3 years have enriched our music, taught us many lessons, and have inspired us to persevere through the many obstacles that accompany a life of full-time professional musicianship.  We still believe that the shoots and ladders that come with this profession are not only worth it, but that our work is perhaps more relevant now than ever. During these trying times, we take great responsibility in being American musicians representing the United States while abroad. We want to continue to share our work with European communities, and develop infrastructure that may allow us the opportunity to bring European musicians from Spain and France to Austin, Texas.  Why We Need Your Help:  We need to fund the release of a vinyl pressing of our recent album RIPTIDE. This is an expense that we just can't do on our own. The vinyl pressing, vinyl mastering, packaging, and shipping of album RIPTIDE will cost $3000. We hope to collect vinyl pre-orders through this fundraiser which we'll ship to fans once they're available.  Atlas Maior needs to cover European transportation costs for the 14 days spanning this September’s tour.  We hope to hire a publicist to further expose fans of world music, and jazz to the sounds of Atlas Maior within the countries of the Unitied Kingdom, Netherlands, Spain, and France. This would allow us to further our reach, and put the group in a closer position to being admitted into upper tier European music festivals. The European album release of RIPTIDE is set for October 4th. The goal is to obtain editorial reviews of RIPTIDE in major credible European publications  such as BBC, The Guardian, El Pais, La Vaguardia, Le Monde, European World Music Charts, Song Lines, and more.  European Album Release Expenses: Publicist for two months of representation, and tour support: $4000CD Duplication, postage, and mailers to journalists throughout Europe: $540 European Tour Expenses: Two round trip tickets, train fairs, hopper flights, bus fees, and daily per diem for food costs for two weeks: $1950 Vinyl Album Pressing Expenses: Pressing of the album: $2500 Mastering and set up fees, with album artwork layouts: $600 Total Expenses: $9,590.00 Here Are The Perks! We want our supporters to be a part of this journey, and we've put a lot of effort and consideration into perks for funding our campaign.

<h3>Huh?</h3>
<p>Oh, hello again. So like I said, this campaign is to fund the recording and production of my new album, Flower/Weed. My previous albums were all recorded on a friend's laptop in their bedroom with broken equipment and quickly finished before they had to leave for their graveyard shift at Arby's. But this time it will be different!</p>
<p>We have already completely finished two songs from the album, and they are available for your listening pleasure for FREE right now:<br/> </p>

<p><i>Silver Lining</i> is an upbeat Lucinda-esque ode to codependency that's guaranteed to be the next ""summer anthem"" at the mental hospital.</p>
<p><i>Flower/Weed</i> is the mellow companion piece to the aforementioned track. With tragically melodic vibes that call to mind Elliot Smith, it's guaranteed to be the next ""laying on your bed alone at 4am unable to move"" anthem of the summer!</p>
<p>There are still eight more hits to be recorded: Butterfly, Downtown, Changes, New Feelin, Turn Around, Drank All Night, Want it Back, He Held On To Me... and we need your help to do it!</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Why?</h3>
<p><i>Silver Lining</i> was recorded with a full backing band at Excello Recording in Greenpoint, Brooklyn. For this track we wanted the sound of a bunch of people playing together in one room. It's fun, it's upbeat, and it turned out <i>exactly</i> the way we wanted it to! It was the most fulfilling recording experience I've ever had. I'm so grateful to all the musicians and my producer for helping me make my dreams a reality. Hiring great musicians, rehearsing, recording, and mixing/mastering all ended up costing about 1,500 buckaroos... that's for <i>one</i> song!</p>
<p>This is why we're asking for your help. We have prepared a budget of around $1,200 per song to complete the album. This money will go toward covering studio costs, paying my producer Keith Xenos, and hiring the right musicians for each track. As you can see, we've come up with some fun ""perks"" for all your generous contributions. I promise this is going to be an incredible album! The two songs we've completed so far are just the ""tip of the ol' iceberg!""</p>
<p> </p>

</div></div>","Huh?
Oh, hello again. So like I said, this campaign is to fund the recording and production of my new album, Flower/Weed. My previous albums were all recorded on a friend's laptop in their bedroom with broken equipment and quickly finished before they had to leave for their graveyard shift at Arby's. But this time it will be different!
We have already completely finished two songs from the album, and they are available for your listening pleasure for FREE right now: 

 

 
Silver Lining is an upbeat Lucinda-esque ode to codependency that's guaranteed to be the next ""summer anthem"" at the mental hospital.
Flower/Weed is the mellow companion piece to the aforementioned track. With tragically melodic vibes that call to mind Elliot Smith, it's guaranteed to be the next ""laying on your bed alone at 4am unable to move"" anthem of the summer!
There are still eight more hits to be recorded: Butterfly, Downtown, Changes, New Feelin, Turn Around, Drank All Night, Want it Back, He Held On To Me... and we need your help to do it!
 
Why?
Silver Lining was recorded with a full backing band at Excello Recording in Greenpoint, Brooklyn. For this track we wanted the sound of a bunch of people playing together in one room. It's fun, it's upbeat, and it turned out exactly the way we wanted it to! It was the most fulfilling recording experience I've ever had. I'm so grateful to all the musicians and my producer for helping me make my dreams a reality. Hiring great musicians, rehearsing, recording, and mixing/mastering all ended up costing about 1,500 buckaroos... that's for one song!
This is why we're asking for your help. We have prepared a budget of around $1,200 per song to complete the album. This money will go toward covering studio costs, paying my producer Keith Xenos, and hiring the right musicians for each track. As you can see, we've come up with some fun ""perks"" for all your generous contributions. I promise this is going to be an incredible album! The two songs we've completed so far are just the ""tip of the ol' iceberg!""

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Hi there! I'm <a href=""http://nickarseneau.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Nick</a>. I grew up in Grimsby, ON, and now make my home in Toronto. I am a jazz double-bassist and electric bassist, and I'm very fortunate to have a great band of musicians playing my original compositions - The <i>Nick Arseneau Sextet</i>.</p>
<p>We need your help to record and produce our first album! The songs selected for the recording represent the essence of my creative jazz work over the past eight years, from youth to adulthood. I am calling this album <i>To Niagara, With Love<i>. </i></i>For me, this record is a personal statement of coming-of-age, and I couldn't think of a better place to dedicate the album to than where I grew up.</p>
<p>The music I strive to write is melodic, engaging, interactive, and dynamic. The wonderful musicians I work with mirror this philosophy, and this is as much an expression of my own artistic spirit as it is for each musician involved. Please help us achieve our goal to share this music with the world!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>After applying to the Ontario Arts Council for funding to produce this album, we unfortunately didn't make the cut. Still, I decided that this music needed to be shared with the world, so I made up my mind to fund the record out of my own pocket. However, I quickly realized that this is no easy feat. Artists' fees, studio rental, engineering fees, mixing, mastering, promotion and pressing the recording to CD - it takes a lot of time, money, blood sweat and tears to produce an album. We are asking for your generous support of $3,500 to help offset these costs.</p>
<p>There are some unique perks to contributing; all campaign donors will be featured in the album liner notes in a special thank-you section. I will also personally sign each CD redeemed through donation. If you would like to get a behind-the-scenes look at my compositions or want to play along with my tunes, I am offering a PDF download pack or signed paper copies of all lead sheets and scores featured on the recording. Lastly, if you would like something extra special, you can redeem a private concert with some or all members of the group, or a custom-written jazz tune which you get to name, of which you will receive all original sheet music parts and a demo recording.</p>

<h3>DG Solaris is born</h3>
<p>Danny and Leana Green and friends have made an expansive, progressive pop album. </p>
<p>We need your help to get it to your ears.</p>
<p>Danny: I have been a songwriter since my early teens and have been making music with my band, <strong>Laish</strong> for over 10 years. I’ve travelled the world, sharing my songs to people across the UK, Europe and the States, making four albums which received widespread plays on BBC6Music and some pretty ecstatic reviews from the press, such as:</p>
<p>“Wondrous folk pop ballads” – <strong>Rolling Stone</strong></p>
<p>""Beguling songs of Love"" - <strong>MOJO</strong></p>
<p>""A great pop record"" <strong>Steve Lamacq, BBC 6Music</strong></p>
<p>""Beautiful and hypnotic"" <strong>Tom Robinson, BBC 6Music</strong></p>
<p>""One of the finest songwriters inside and outside of British borders - <strong>Ondarock</strong></p>
<p>Last year I met Leana and my life took a new turn. We got married in December and spent the first half of 2019, on a once in a lifetime trip across South America. While we travelled, we wrote and recorded many songs, making demos in nature with a laptop, a small keyboard and an acoustic guitar. When we returned to London, we went immediately to Bella Union Studio and finished the album with some amazing musicians and a fantastic producer.</p>
<p>The 12 songs of the album are mixed and mastered, and I feel that this is the best work that I have produced. This is also the first musical offering by Leana Green, who co-wrote all of these songs and sings, plays piano, synth and flute. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need </h3>
<p>We are asking for £10,000. </p>
<p>Here is our breakdown:</p>
<p>Musician fees - £685</p>
<p>Recording and mixing costs £3228</p>
<p>Mastering £720</p>
<p>Vinyl manufacture £1200</p>
<p>Cd manufacture £1000</p>
<p>Radio plugging agent £1500</p>
<p>Postal costs, crowd funding fees, extras £2167</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Reaching the initial target of our campaign will enable us to pay for the recording and manufacturing costs and to employ a radio plugger to build on my previous successes on BBC Radio with Laish. We are also planning live shows, both exciting full band shows and intimate solo/duo shows. <strong>If we raise over £10k</strong>, we would spend additional money on music videos, a press agent, photography, advertising and support for touring expenses.</p>
<h3><strong>What You Get</strong></h3>
<p>Every contribution above £10 will receive <strong>4 brand new songs from the album today</strong> and then the digital album prior to the release date. Signed cd and vinyl are available along with house concerts, cover songs, original songs, demos, songwriting and guitar lessons, original drawings and handwritten lyric sheets. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The album is already finished and produced to the highest quality with the best musicians and an excellent producer. I have previously delivered and marketed four albums with Laish so I am confident in being able to present this in the most professional way possible.</p>

<h3><u>Short Summary</u></h3>
<p><u><strong>About The Band:</strong></u></p>
<p><strong><i>Strange Breed are a 4 piece, all queer, all female garage rock band based out of Vancouver, BC.</i></strong> Sounding like every 90’s riot grrrl fans’ feminist wet dream with an unexpected modern rock twist – Strange Breed has been described as a “Grittier B52’s”, or what a collaboration between Veruca Salt, Paramore, Bikini Kill and Hole would sound like.</p>
<p><i><strong>They are currently in the studio with industry veteran <a href=""http://www.canadianrecordingservices.com/producers_engineers_mixers/12_darrengrahn.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Darren Grahn</a> working on their first studio album,</strong></i> and are slowly taking over their local music scene one show at a time. Strange Breed constantly has individuals of all different backgrounds reaching out and expressing how much they appreciate seeing queer representation in accessible music, and hearing “good, catchy tunes with an actual message”.</p>
<p><i><strong>Strange Breed is all about promoting positive change through the messages in their music and in their general interactions with the world and online –</strong></i> be it political, social, or based around physical/mental health. They have been a part of raising money for vital local organizations like <a href=""https://musicheals.ca/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Music Heals BC</a>, <a href=""https://girlsrockcampvancouver.ca/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Girls Rock Camp Vancouver,</a> <a href=""http://dewc.ca/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">The Downtown Eastside Women’s Centre</a> and <a href=""http://wish-vancouver.net/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">WISH!

<p><u><strong>About The Director:</strong></u></p>
<p><strong><i>Lindsay Hitchcock</i></strong> is a director and camera operator based out of Vancouver BC. Graduating with ​honours from Capilano University’s Bachelor of Motion Picture Art Degree Lindsay has a wide range of experience, from directing short independent films to working in the camera department on union features.

<p><strong><i>This campaign is important to us, because this video for ""Closer"" will be our first professional music video! </i></strong>That is a cause to celebrate! That said, we are also simultaneously working hard on finishing our first professional, studio album and frankly... that costs big $$$. We understand that our listeners want exciting content, and that involves more than just releasing new singles or playing another show.</p>
<p><strong>We are at a pivotal point in our career as a band </strong>where something like a polished music video that <i>truly encompasses our energy and values as a band will help us break the glass ceiling </i>to the next level - not only for ourselves, but so that we can<i> have more to offer our community and our listeners. We want this video to be filled with people we love and admire - local talent that we want to support as much as possible.</i> <i><strong>That is where the money factor comes in, and that is where we need your help!</strong></i></p>

<h3><u>The Impact</u></h3>
<p><strong>In supporting this project, you are supporting female, queer and LGBTQ+ artists all over the world with an easy click. </strong>How? </p>
<p><strong><i>As we mentioned before, what we do is not just for us.</i></strong> We LOVE what we do, and we do it BECAUSE we love it. <i>But, we also are we are as a band to demand more attention and space in the world for queer and female artists. </i>Especially when it comes to modern rock music, which is typically monopolized by white, straight, cis-gendered males making ""macho rock"" and typically contributing to a culture that's about women to the back of the room or in the bedroom - and queers? Get out. <i>We want visibility! When do we want it? NOW!</i></p>
<p><strong><i>We're unapologetically who we are, and we know that our music helps people of all identities find a sense of community and connection - and it will only do so more, the more that we gain traction. </i></strong><i>We plan to give back to as many queer, female, non-binary, POC artists in our community as possible through this project, and many more!</i></p>

<h3><u>What We Need &amp; What You Get</u></h3>
<p><i><strong>Based on quotes we've received from the artists we'll be working with and our calculations of all expenses, here is the breakdown of the $2500 we need to make this video a success:</strong></i></p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>$1000 </strong>- Section Four Productions -  This covers our director / team of camera operators, lighting, and post production of the video.</li>
<li>
<strong>$700</strong> - <a href=""https://www.cranestudios.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Crane Studios</a> Rental - This covers a 10 hour day at a professional photography/film studio. This 2500 sq ft space includes change rooms, makeup area, kitchen, washrooms, backdrops and some lighting as well. </li>
<li>
<strong>$300 </strong>- Choreography - This covers the fees of professional local Burlesque Artist, <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/lilaclust/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Lilac Luste </a>for her work choreographing the dance/acting segments of the video. </li>
<li>
<strong>$250</strong> - Makeup / Hair - This covers the fees of makeup and hair services on site during the shoot. </li>
<li>
<strong>$250 </strong>- Dancers / Community Extras - This covers half of the fees we will be using to compensate the dancers and community extras we will be having featured in the video - the rest we will match out of pocket &lt;3 </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>If our entire goal of $2500 is <u>not </u>reached, </strong>we will still be aiming to split the funds that we DO raise as equal as possible to reflect the percentages of what needs to be covered as relayed above. For example, if we raise $1000 by the campaign deadline, then we would still be putting 40% of the budget towards the film crew ($400), as we would be if we received the full amount, and so on and so forth. </p>
<p><strong>Our plan for covering the rest of the budget </strong>would simply be to come out of pocket and to continue to contribute from our shows, merch sales, music sales etc. This however, might push out the expected release of the video <strong><i>from this spring to later this year, or possibly next year! But it will certainly not stop the video from happening. </i></strong></p>

<h3><u>Risks &amp; Challenges</u></h3>

<p><strong>We are always being proactive </strong>and consistently applying for grants and contests, but frankly when you're a ""newer"" band like we are, it can be hard to make yourself stand out against the many hundreds / thousands of other applicants who may have more of a track record. <i>So you always have to have a plan B....and C, and D, and E and....</i></p>
<p><strong>We plan to make this video regardless of any financial or other miscellaneous challenges that may come our way. </strong>What it comes down to, is that it will ultimately be more difficult to execute the vision for the video (as described in our Campaign Video above) without the funds we are trying to raise. <i>It will also be harder for us to compensate our team and our fellow artists fairly who are involved in the creation of this project, <strong>and that is extremely important to us. </strong></i></p>
<p><i><strong>We want to convey who Strange Breed is and what we are about in the fullest form through this video, </strong>so we stand a better chance at having a stronger voice for our community, and being a part of the movement to create more queer visibility in modern rock music!</i></p>

</div></div>","Short Summary
About The Band:
Strange Breed are a 4 piece, all queer, all female garage rock band based out of Vancouver, BC. Sounding like every 90’s riot grrrl fans’ feminist wet dream with an unexpected modern rock twist – Strange Breed has been described as a “Grittier B52’s”, or what a collaboration between Veruca Salt, Paramore, Bikini Kill and Hole would sound like.
They are currently in the studio with industry veteran Darren Grahn working on their first studio album, and are slowly taking over their local music scene one show at a time. Strange Breed constantly has individuals of all different backgrounds reaching out and expressing how much they appreciate seeing queer representation in accessible music, and hearing “good, catchy tunes with an actual message”.
Strange Breed is all about promoting positive change through the messages in their music and in their general interactions with the world and online – be it political, social, or based around physical/mental health. They have been a part of raising money for vital local organizations like Music Heals BC, Girls Rock Camp Vancouver, The Downtown Eastside Women’s Centre and WISH! Drop In Centre Society.
 
About The Director:
Lindsay Hitchcock is a director and camera operator based out of Vancouver BC. Graduating with ​honours from Capilano University’s Bachelor of Motion Picture Art Degree Lindsay has a wide range of experience, from directing short independent films to working in the camera department on union features. With a love for experimentation and research of technique, Lindsay enjoys utilizing filmmaking as a storytelling medium to reveal and discover essences that simply cannot be replicated in non-visual platforms.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This campaign is important to us, because this video for ""Closer"" will be our first professional music video! That is a cause to celebrate! That said, we are also simultaneously working hard on finishing our first professional, studio album and frankly... that costs big $$$. We understand that our listeners want exciting content, and that involves more than just releasing new singles or playing another show.
We are at a pivotal point in our career as a band where something like a polished music video that truly encompasses our energy and values as a band will help us break the glass ceiling to the next level - not only for ourselves, but so that we can have more to offer our community and our listeners. We want this video to be filled with people we love and admire - local talent that we want to support as much as possible. That is where the money factor comes in, and that is where we need your help!


The Impact
In supporting this project, you are supporting female, queer and LGBTQ+ artists all over the world with an easy click. How? 
As we mentioned before, what we do is not just for us. We LOVE what we do, and we do it BECAUSE we love it. But, we also are we are as a band to demand more attention and space in the world for queer and female artists. Especially when it comes to modern rock music, which is typically monopolized by white, straight, cis-gendered males making ""macho rock"" and typically contributing to a culture that's about women to the back of the room or in the bedroom - and queers? Get out. We want visibility! When do we want it? NOW!
We're unapologetically who we are, and we know that our music helps people of all identities find a sense of community and connection - and it will only do so more, the more that we gain traction. We plan to give back to as many queer, female, non-binary, POC artists in our community as possible through this project, and many more!
 
“…The positive atmosphere they created did not, however, disguise the seriousness of the issues addressed in some of their songs — “The C Word,” an homage to consent, and “Gun Control,” a challenge to the hypocrisy of the NRA.

Risks & Challenges
Like any creative project, there are always some challenges involved. For us, the main hurdle to overcome has been funding this project - and that is why we've reached out to our amazing community (you!). 
We are always being proactive and consistently applying for grants and contests, but frankly when you're a ""newer"" band like we are, it can be hard to make yourself stand out against the many hundreds / thousands of other applicants who may have more of a track record. So you always have to have a plan B....and C, and D, and E and....
We plan to make this video regardless of any financial or other miscellaneous challenges that may come our way. What it comes down to, is that it will ultimately be more difficult to execute the vision for the video (as described in our Campaign Video above) without the funds we are trying to raise. It will also be harder for us to compensate our team and our fellow artists fairly who are involved in the creation of this project, and that is extremely important to us. 
We want to convey who Strange Breed is and what we are about in the fullest form through this video, so we stand a better chance at having a stronger voice for our community, and being a part of the movement to create more queer visibility in modern rock music!

El álbum se inspiró en las muchas historias de inmigrantes que un día decidieron dejar a sus familias, su gente y su tierra natal en busca de un futuro mejor y más próspero. Nuestra música traerá esperanza, encanto y mensajes optimistas sobre el amor, la vida y el mantenerse fiel a uno mismo mientras cumples tus sueños. ¡Su contribución nos ayudará a lograr tanto! Siempre estaremos agradecidos por su confianza en ayudarnos a tener éxito en la difusión de nuestra música, nuestro arte, y nuestro mensaje.""Highly recommend this band to anyone looking for an incredible Afro-Colombian performance. They played at my best friend’s wedding and tore the house down"" WHO WE ARE Ronald PoloA composer, Gaitero, and musician at heart, Polo has been composing since the early age of seven and currently has more than eighty songs inspired by family, love, life experiences, tradition, culture, and of course music itself. Polo has also collaborated in many different projects with other well-known composers and musicians throughout New York City.  His interest is to take both his culture and musical notes to every corner of the world[Español] Compositor, gaitero y músico de corazón. Polo ha estado componiendo desde la temprana edad de siete años y actualmente tiene más de ochenta canciones inspiradas en el amor, la familia, su experiencias de vida, la tradición, la cultura, y por supuesto la música en sí. Polo también ha colaborado en muchos proyectos diferentes con otros compositores y músicos conocidos en toda la ciudad de Nueva York. Su interés es llevar su cultura y sus notas musicales a todos los rincones del mundo.Moris Cañate A talented drummer coming from a modest family with a lineage of legendary Afro-traditional musicians and dancers. Cañate is the nephew of the late Paulino Salgado (Batata III), the single most accomplished Afro-Colombian folkloric percussionist of all time. Cañate is considered by many to be among the top five Tambor Alegre players in the world. He has performed around the globe proudly representing his Afro-descendent roots and Colombia's Caribbean coast.[Español] Un talentoso tamborero que viene de una familia modesta pero con un linaje de músicos y bailarines afro-tradicionales legendarios. Cañate es el sobrino del difunto Paulino Salgado (Batata III), el percusionista folklórico afrocolombiano más exitoso de todos los tiempos. Cañate es considerado por muchos como uno de los cinco mejores tocadores de Tambor Alegre en el mundo. Se ha presentado en todo el mundo representando con orgullo sus raíces afrodescendientes y la costa caribeña de Colombia.Johanna CastañedaCastañeda hails from the capital city of Bogota and also comes from a modest home full of artistic traditions. She developed her interest in dancing at an early age, and with the support of her family she started her artistic career. But shortly after, her family decided to migrate to the US looking for better times. It was in a foreign land where Castañeda found herself more drawn into her Colombian traditional roots, in terms of both culture and music. In 2009, Castañeda becomes a key member of Grupo Rebolu bringing not only her voice, but also her musical knowledge.[Español] Castañeda es de la ciudad capital de Bogotá y también proviene de una casa modesta llena de tradiciones artísticas. Desarrolló su interés por el baile a una edad temprana y con el apoyo de su familia comenzó su carrera artística. Pero poco después, su familia decidió emigrar a los Estados Unidos en busca de tiempos buenos. Fue en tierras lejanas donde Castañeda se encontró más atraída por sus raíces tradicionales colombianas, tanto en términos de cultura como de música. En 2009, Castañeda se convierte en un miembro clave de Grupo Rebolu, aportando no solo su voz, sino también sus conocimientos musicales. WHAT WE NEED & WHAT YOU GETSo here is the breakdown of how the funds will be distributed for the making of Tiempos Buenos:[Español] Aquí está el desglose de cómo se distribuirán los fondos para la realización de Tiempos Buenos:* Inidegogo Fee $500* Production $1,500* Musicians $ 1,000* Recording and Mixing $ 1,000* Printing and Merch $ 2,000* Marketing and PR $2,000* Showcases, trips and festivals $ 2,000* Mastering $ 1,000As a ""Thank You"" for your contribution, you will receive:

That is why we feel a strong need to share our journey with you.This band was founded in 2004 by Ronald Polo (composer, Gaitero) and Moris Canate (percussion); two best friends from Barranquilla who trained together in music and dance school since the age of five. Young Ronald and Moris toured internationally with some of Colombia’s best-known folkloric groups. But it was in New York City where they set their ground and founded Rebolu.Johanna Castaneda joined the band as female vocalist in 2009. At the same time, Johanna took the role of ""Manager"" of Rebolu which helped in giving structure and direction to the band. The three together lead Rebolu, and want to take their sound all over the world.New York City has been a great home base for Rebolu; this city offers many opportunities for musicians and bands, but it also offers many challenges. And add to that the life challenges that sometimes makes us disconnect from what we really want to do, which is Music. All the members of this band have their own stories to tell, but in the end of the day we are trying to succeed in this business. We all share the same passion and love for the art, and it is this love and dedication that makes us connect beautifully when playing together, and we feel this energy is well expressed on stage.No matter the circumstances in life, we in Rebolu know what we want, and that is to continue bringing a positive message to the world full of Afro-Colombian rhythms and our very own ""sabrosura"".[Español] Rebolu está donde está hoy gracias a nuestros seguidores que han estado con nosotros todos estos años. Es por eso sentimos una gran necesidad de compartir nuestro emprendimiento con ustedes.La banda fue fundada en 2004 por Ronald Polo (compositor, Gaitero) y Moris Cañate (percusionista); dos mejores amigos de Barranquilla que entrenaron juntos en la escuela de música y danza desde los cinco años. En su juventud, Ronald y Moris fueron parte de giras internacionales con algunos de los grupos folclóricos más conocidos de Colombia. Pero fue en la ciudad de Nueva York donde establecieron su terreno y fundaron Rebolu.Johanna Castañeda se unió a la banda como vocalista femenina en 2009. Al mismo tiempo, Johanna asumió el rol de ""Gerente"" de Rebolu, que ayudó a dar estructura y dirección a la banda. Ahora los tres lideran a Rebolu, y quieren llevar su sonido a todo el mundo.La ciudad de Nueva York ha sido una gran base para Rebolu; Esta ciudad ofrece muchas oportunidades para músicos y bandas, pero también ofrece muchos desafíos. Y agregue a eso los desafíos de la vida que a veces nos desconectan de lo que realmente queremos hacer, que es la música. Todos los miembros de esta banda tienen sus propias historias que contar, pero al final del día estamos tratando de tener éxito en este negocio. Todos compartimos la misma pasión y amor por el arte, y es este amor y dedicación lo que nos hace conectar maravillosamente cuando tocamos juntos, y sentimos que esta energía se expresa bien en el escenario.Sin importar las circunstancias de la vida, en Rebolu sabemos lo que queremos, y eso es continuar trayendo un mensaje positivo al mundo lleno de ritmos afro-colombianos y con nuestra propia sabrosura.OTHER WAYS YOU CAN HELPWe believe in the power of word-of-mouth!

<h3>Who are we?</h3>
<p>As one of the most successful and surprising stars of the East European female fronted heavy metal stage, <strong>Scarlet Aura</strong> goes wild on breaking barriers of the music industry. Proving first to themselves that anything is possible, Scarlet Aura is bringing hope into young bands’ hearts that there can be professionalism if you have enough passion and dedication in the metal music industry.</p>
<p>They won an international music contest as they astounded the public with their songs, bike on the stage, innovative props and, last but not least, with their winged vocalist. The band has toured with <i>Tarja Turunen</i>, <i>Rhapsody Reunion</i>, had been the first band to tour for 26 shows in China, released 4 albums, 2 singles, 1 live DVD and also the first fantasy book from an enchanting trilogy called “<strong>The book of Scarlet</strong>”.</p>

<p>This is only a short story of what these courageous Scarlets accomplished in less than 5 years and now they are ready for the next step in their adventure – creating their own record label!</p>
<p><i>“All we do is for the public! Our music, the stories, the books, the videos, our social media exposure. And because of that we also want to make sure that the public has the best musical experience and that’s why we decided to make our own record label. We will directly make sure that the albums are distributed in their countries, in their towns, or digitally in a correct and responsible way. For that we have decided to utilize an innovative technology – a blockchain platform – that will ensure secure, fast and transparent distribution of music, protect artists rights and also artists revenues. We love the music and we are 100% dedicated to our heavy metal life and we had to understand that if we love the music, we have to accept the industry and now by doing this step we’re not only accepting it, we’re being part of it, we’re making it. What we want to accomplish by that is the perfect understanding of the music business so we can do it properly and legit. And as we’ll gather this experience, we’ll support young bands in releasing albums, properly invest in a production, PR or marketing campaign and distribution and give the best services we all like to receive to touch our goals, having always the public in the first place. This step will also prepare us for signing with the top record labels and will put Scarlet Aura on the list of best heavy metal bands.” </i></p>

<h3>
<strong>Our goal...</strong> </h3>
<p>... is to create a new exclusively Rock/Metal Record label – Silver City Records, go wild with its first release  – our ""Hot'n'Heavy"" album and sign new bands. </p>
<p>To get the costs covered (album production, manufacturing, distribution, marketing, PR, setting up the record label and purchasing the sold perks),  we would need your help  to reach 15000€.</p>

<h3>What is Maker Park Radio?</h3>
<p>Free streaming Community Radio! We rent a space inside the Staten Island Makerspace in the Stapleton neighborhood of Staten Island, NYC!</p>
<p>Maker Park Radio began in July of 2017. In just one and a half years, we have broadcast to over 200,000 people around the world! It was started in order to bring people together through arts and music programming. Co-founders Tom &amp; Kristin are life-long music fans, Tom works as a harbor pilot and Co-founder Kristin is a music producer and DJ who spent many years in the music business. They were inspired to build a radio station when they felt that so much music is chosen by an algorithm and wanted to create a place where curated playlists were created by people in love with their music genre. They also wanted to create a place that built a community of music lovers and artists, and served to give a voice to music that does not get as much airplay, as well as to local artists and entrepreneurs to highlight all that we have to offer here.</p>
<p><b>Community Radio is a community builder! </b></p>
