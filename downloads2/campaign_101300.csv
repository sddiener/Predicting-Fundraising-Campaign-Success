“If this turns out to be half as awesome as the Kodiak, it'll be money well spent. I fly in the backseat of the FA-18F for the US Navy, and every time I do, I wear the Kodiak. I have full confidence that if something ever happened and I found myself in a survival scenario, I'd be well-prepared no matter the environment I might find myself in. Thanks guys. Looking forward to the firebiner!” EH

<p>Hello world! Our names are Donny and Taylor Adams! We have been married for a little over three years now and live in beautiful Portland, Oregon.</p>
<p><strong><em>A bit about Donny</em></strong>: I am aspiring to be a high school History teacher. I enjoy all types of music ranging from rock to classical, alternative and even jazz if the mood is right.  I read books and I play games with friends and family. </p>
<p><strong><em>A bit about Taylor</em></strong>: I'm actively pursuing my bachelor’s degree in early childhood education. I absolutely love children and am thankful for the opportunity to teach such amazing minds! </p>
<p><strong><em>Our Campaign: </em></strong>During the summer of 2013, we plan to participate in a short-term mission effort in Debrecen, Hungary, along with a team of adults and young people from the Metro Church of Christ congregation.  We will be teaching approximately 86 Hungarians about Christ, one-on-one, every day for two weeks. We will be teaching the students English by using the text from the Bible.</p>
<p>Although the church in Debrecen, Hungary only consists of 8 people, they are very passionate about spreading the word of God in their community! The area is very churched with the presence of Calvinism, Catholicism, Eastern Orthodox and a growing presence of Atheism. There is a need in this area and that’s where we feel God is calling us to go and help. </p>
<p> This is our first trip of this type, but our team will be led by seasoned teachers. In addition to teaching God’s word, we will be gaining valuable experience as we consider whether to become full time missionaries.</p>
<p><strong><em>Our Expenses:</em></strong></p>
<p>Expenses: We will need $6,000 to cover our expenses for our short-term mission trip to Debrecen, Hungary. The $6,000 will cover the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Round-trip airfare (about $1900x2=$3800)</li>
<li>Teaching materials ($50x2=$100)</li>
<li>Housing ($30 a night times 14 nights=$420)</li>
<li>In country travel and transportation i.e. hotels, buses, trains ($200x2=400)</li>
<li>All food and meals ($200x2=$400)</li>
<li>We have been asked to at least budget an additional $100 per weekend for other discretionary expenditures ($100x2=200)</li>
</ul><p>The total for the above is $5320. Since we haven't locked down a price for our airlines tickets yet, the above price could go up (hopefully it goes down!) We're shooting for $6,000 just in case tickets go up or if someone in our group isn't able to reach their fundraising goal. </p>
<p>If we don't reach our goal of $6,000, the funds that are raised will still go toward our mission trip to Debrecen, Hungary. If we exceed our goal (which would be awesome!) the left over funds will go to support our team members who have not reached their goals. If everyone has reached their goals, the remaining funds will go into the W.E.I (World English Institute) to continue to teach English and the Word of God to people around the world!</p>

<h3>Short Summary &amp; Impact Opportunity</h3>
<p>Hi! My name is Erin Hendry and I am a Pastoral Leadership Major at Vanguard University of Southern California. In chapel during my first semester of college, our Global and Local Outreach Programs launched our mission opportunities for Spring Break and Summer, and San Francisco caught my eye immediately. I have served in San Francisco before, and I would love to serve there many times again! There are so many broken and homeless men, women, and children on the streets in San Fran; however, with brokenness comes an opportunity for healing, hope, and redemption. Through serving on our SFO team, San Francisco Outreach, I would be blessed with multiple opportunities to serve these broken people and share that there is always hope and life after the hardships and struggles. All in all, I have a huge heart for not only the city, but the homeless, lost, and broken, and I want to reach out and share that there is so much more in this world! By supporting me on my trip to San Francisco, you will help me not only achieve shelter, food, and all those necessities, but you will be a part of serving these people who deserve to know the Good News and deserve to be served by people who genuinely care about them and their stories. Here at Vanguard one of our theme statements is ""your story matters,"" now it's my turn to share with those who need to hear it most, ""your story matters too.""</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The entire mission trip to San Francisco costs $500, which will go towards my own personal travel, shelter, food, as well as towards the resources needed to serve the homeless - food, materials, etc. You will see that I have some perks for specific donations! If you are able to donate $25, I promise to send you a letter about my experience in San Francisco! If you are able to donate $50, I promise to not only send you a letter, but I will also send you pictures of my trip sharing my own experience with you! And lastly, if you are able to donate $100, I promise to send you a letter, photos, a video documentary of special moments and peoples personal testimonies and experiences while in San Francisco! If I do not reach my entire goal, the funds will still go towards my trip to San Francisco; I trust God will provide all that I need!</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you are unable to donate, that is completely understandable! However, ways you could help are: First and always first, PRAYER! If you could please be praying for myself and the SFO team as we prepare and leave on our mission trip! We ask for God's guidance, and that His work is done wherever He desires! And we ask for prayer over the homeless we will come in contact with, that they will be blessed and open to allowing us to serve them. Also, if you could send this out to friends and family using the Share Tools that would be wonderful as well! Even if they too are unable to donate, prayer is always good and always needed!</p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>SUBTECH SPORTS has several years of experience within product development, marketing and sales of retail products in the sport industry. After successfully launching multiple products, our team is well prepared to foresee and mitigate risks at all stages of a product development and launching campaign.</p>
<p>With that said, we also know that theory and practice are two different things and as a startup, with limited resources, you should communicate frequently with your customer about the situation, available resources and the plan to deal with challenges now and ahead.</p>
<p>We are not new to crowdfunding and given our recent campaigns, PRO DRYBAG 45L and PRO DRYCASE, we learnt a great deal from it. Crowdfunding is a relatively new format between customers and creators and it raises the bar in product development since a significant part of the process happens ”LIVE”. But the challenges can at the same time be used as advantages and given that both parties collaborate with an open mind, great things can be achieved.</p>
<p>For this campaign we have already fully developed the PRO DRYBAG 2.0 Series so this time around we have already moved directly in to production so we can make sure we get these awesome bags out to all you valued backers as quickly as possible.</p>

Qube offers  a quick pitching time of less than 2 minutes ,out of the bag to fully pitched and ready to go meaning you’ll have that drink in your hand quicker than ever before.Unlike other quick pitching tents in fact like many other tents in the camping world you can stand up in all our variations from the 2 person right through to the 4 person so no more stooping over or doing the dying fish while you try and get your jeans on !The Qube is as easy to pack away as it is to set up so you won’t need to be an expert in origami to try and get it back into the bag when you’re ready to come home.One of the major issues with standard tents is being woken up by the sun blaring through the tent wall when it comes up at 5 am so with the with Qube tent we have added  a black lining to our material to block out the sunlight so you won’t be woken by that early morning sun anymore.Specifications Our  extensive ventilation system makes for a cool environment inside The material is PU coated and rated to a hydrostatic head rating of 4000 meaning you’ll keep nice and dry moderate rain conditions in addition is it treated in accordance with CPAI84 Flammability standards A heavy duty 300D Cotton Oxford material means this tent is strong and robust.A removable ground sheet means you can have extra comfort underfoot and makes the tent easier to clean when you pack it away.The key to the  Qube’s is that they are easy to erect and offer you a great space inside , in addition we have a few extras  that will make this tent in a class of its own..Connect with your Friends Unlike other tents you can connect together any Qube to another Qube in any size so the 4 person  will connect to a 2 person or 3 person using the universal tunnel meaning you can build your own bespoke set up of interconnected tents.  On every Qube you can connect on every corner meaning the possibilities to join are endless. Just image the fun your group of mate can have connecting together at a festival securing you very own Party area , You can use a Qube just to hang out it when the weather turns bad ,Sizes & Dimensions As part of this campaign we are offering a 2 Person , 3 Person  and 4 Person version of the tents and in Blue , Red , Orange , Green & Black colour options Add On's In addition as an add on  we are also offering you a solar panel that can be slipped inside the window of the Qube to store power  into a 13,000 mAh battery pack .   The solar panel  simply unfolds  and slips into the pocket behind your window and plugs directly into the battery pack to store this free energy. This battery pack has a huge capacity and will charge a mobile device to full power 5-6 times from one stored charge. This pack can then be used to charge your smart phone or smart device or in fact anything with a USB connection  or it can be used to power the ultra cool  LED lighting strip that will offer a soft lighting inside your tent.We are offering this LED light strip in white or if you want your tent to be the party tent then the colour changing version is the one for you. Each Strip comes with a Storage stuff bag and fixings to secure your strip inside the tent. Technical Specifications Manufacturing Experience We have been developing the Qubes for the last 6 months and have finally signed off a sample that we are happy meets all of our strict quality controls and so we now need your help to meet the  materials and production costs to bring this product to market..We have learnt a lot about manufacturing and quality control while manufacturing the Pods and so are confident we have all the processes and relationships in place to deliver great quality on this project and with our existing distribution network that already covers then UK , Europe and the USA we know we will get this product to you on time.Risks We’ve put together some amazing packages for you to pledge on all we need now is you to help us bring our vision to life with your pledge .Like any overseas manufacturing it comes with risks but we have minimized these risks by selecting professional factories with the ability to scale up volumes and still deliver on time.A second factory visit will be conducted by our team prior to order placement to ensure that our high quality and process standards are fully understood and adhered to .The team we also visit the factory a 3rd time and spend 7-10 days prior to the shipment leaving the factory inspecting and ensuring the product have been manufactured in accordance with the standards established in visit 2. We will not be outsourcing this inspection process it will be our team who do this as they know the product inside out as they have lived and breathed it for 12 months already.We have 6 years experience in dealing with overseas partners and how to deal with them so this isn't our first experience in doing so.We have an established supply chain thanks to our Pod Tent brand that means we have vast experience in shipping products directly to the USA from China and then on to U.S customers and the UK operation deals with all UK and European deliveries from our UK warehouse. These European shipments are shipped then directly from the UK via established distribution partners.All of this means we don't have to get these often complicated processes in place for this project as they will simply slot into our established process.FAQWhat are the sizes and dimensions ?​ 2 person Qube - Set up-  W 195cm ( 6.39ft) x  L 195cm ( 6.39ft) x H 215cm (7.05ft)                                 Packed -W 21cm (8.27"") x L 154cm (5.05ft) x H 21cm (8.27"")                                 Weight 14.8 Kgs ( 32.65 lbs)  - Updated  to - 17 Kgs 3 person Qube - Set up-  W 210cm ( 6.89ft) x  L 210cm ( 6.89ft) x H 225cm (7.38ft)                                 Packed -W 21cm (8.27"") x L 157cm (5.15ft) x H 21cm (8.27"")                                 Weight 15.1 Kgs ( 33.3 lbs) - Updated to 19 Kgs 4 person Qube - Set up-  W 240cm ( 7.87ft) x  L 240cm ( 7.87ft) x H 250cm (8.20ft)                                 Packed -W 21cm (8.27"") x L 178cm (5.83ft) x H 21cm (8.27"")                                 Weight 15.8 Kgs ( 34.8 lbs) - Updated to 20.7 KgsHow do the cope in the wind ?The tents have been tested to a Beaufort scale 3-4 which is winds up to 20 MPH , They are not a flat surface and are in fact 4 triangular shapes that come together at a point on the pull out area.

<p>We offer everyone,  regardless of where one travels and for what

They also often have great solutions, but most of the time depend totally on

<p class=""p3""><span class=""s1"">LassoTag is a Bluetooth 4.0 device combined with an iPhone application (Android in development) used to tag all those things you want to keep in range. </span>The LassoTag when attached to an item will call your iPhone app when it gets out of your range, so you can lasso it back in before it becomes lost!</p>
<p class=""p3""><span class=""s1"">LassoTag will allow you to keep up to seven of your valuables within a 50 foot range of you and your smartphone, making it nearly impossible for you to lose them, leave them behind, or make them susceptible to theft.</span></p>
<p class=""p3""><span class=""s1""><strong>How Does it Work?</strong></span></p>
<p class=""p3""><span class=""s1"">LassoTag is the first of its kind to utilize an Apple approved application with Bluetooth 4.0 technology. The smartphone application can keep tabs on 1 to 7 items that are tagged with the LassoTag hitch.  All of us are busy and have <strong>items we leave behind:</strong> backpacks, laptops, keys, diaper bags, and cameras filled with memories!  Wouldn’t it be nice to take the monitoring of these items off our minds and onto our phones? Not only is the technology smart, the app is smart too. It reminds you to turn on the wireless tags you want to track each day. It’s simple, cost effective, and the possibilities are endless. </span>   </p>

<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Sometimes in life we need simple reminders.

He recapped the story with his father and what resonates with his father to date is “wouldn’t it have been great if my bag had called my phone.""</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">It’s easy to imagine, his son, Cole, with wife and two children in tow on an amazing family vacation filled with memories.  One day they stop to visit the local zoo. His 4 and 6-year-old are thrilled with the gorilla show as dad and mom watch on with equal interest.  The gorilla’s calm down and resume resting patterns and the family gathers their stuff, off to see the next adventure.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Sadly the camera bag is left behind. Hundreds of photos from this trip and many more taken over the years that simply never made it to computer. Not to mention the Nikon Digital SLR series camera that needs replacing.</span></p>

<h2 class=""template asset""><strong>What makes the TRAKET APP different?</strong></h2>
<p>Does your GPS device have the option or function that allows you with or without a 3rd party to locate your device via a map application? If so, most of those GPS Tracking APPS will simply allow you to bring up a mapping system and then it will show the location of that particular device... That's it!</p>
<h1>***JUST IMAGINE***</h1>
<p>*You come home from work to an empty house. Without calling all of your kids to see where they are, you calmly walk over to an Android Tablet or an IPAD that you may have mounted on the wall or on the counter. Click on the <strong>TRAKET</strong> Icon, and within seconds, the individual locations, up to five devices at a time, identified with a picture of your family members, pops up on a Google map. <strong>(CAN YOUR APP DO THAT?)</strong></p>
<p>* <strong>JUST IMAGINE...</strong> You can tell if they are at a specific location,  on the move in a vehicle , the direction and the speed they are going, or jogging or walking. You can even text them from the <strong>TRAKET APP</strong>, to let them know that you are home, or what time dinner will be ready. <strong>(CAN YOUR APP DO THAT?)</strong></p>
<p><strong>* JUST IMAGINE...</strong> You know your daughter is about to get out of her gymnastic class, you're in the middle of preparing dinner, and you notice your son is in the area. You can notify him via text message from the TRAKET APP to swing by and pick your daughter up. <strong>(CAN YOUR APP DO THAT?)</strong></p>
<p><strong>* JUST IMAGINE...</strong> Your child is in distress, flat tire, car broken down, injured etc., so they activate an SOS alert from the device they are using... All of a sudden, an alarm goes off on your cell phone, the wall monitor, or any other device associated with your secured APP. Instantly, the <strong>TRAKET APP</strong> is activated and the location of your child, indicated by a flashing red beacon, appears on the map. <strong>(CAN YOUR APP DO THAT?)</strong></p>
<p><strong>* JUST IMAGINE...</strong> Someone mistakenly takes your cellphone or your vehicle...Reality check! Someone steals your cellphone or vehicle. You can contact the police, and in real time, give them the location of where it is located the direction of travel, speed or where it has stopped. <strong>(CAN YOUR APP DO THAT?)</strong></p>
<p><strong>* JUST IMAGINE... </strong>Your child is about to take their first class trip out of state. You now can rest easy knowing that at any time you can see their exact location via google maps. GPS devices can be used anywhere in the world, including cities, deserts, oceans, lakes, mountains, or anywhere else a disoriented individual or adventurous traveler may find himself.</p>
<p><strong>* JUST IMAGINE...</strong> Athletic Training Mapping- when you come back from your 3 mile run, you can print out the route you took, distance, time and speed. <strong>(CAN YOUR APP DO THAT?)</strong></p>
<p><strong>* JUST IMAGINE... </strong>Your child decides to hitchhike,  or ride his bike across the country. You would be able to follow them and see their location at any time through the <strong>TRAKET APP</strong>. You can program the <strong>TRAKET APP</strong> to notify you when they reach pre-determined checkpoints, or if they don't reach those locations by the expected time. <strong>(CAN YOUR APP DO THAT?)</strong></p>
<p><strong>* JUST IMAGINE...</strong> You may have someone with Alzheimers/Dementia or Autism who's at risk for wandering. You can set up virtual boundaries around your house or neighborhood, set to activate at predetermined times. If  your loved one goes outside the boundary when it's activated, the <strong>TRAKET APP </strong>alarm is activated, and the location of your loved one, indicated by a flashing red beacon, appears on the map. <strong>(CAN YOUR APP DO THAT?)</strong></p>
<h1>Our Motto is: ""IT CAN BE DONE""</h1>
<p>We refuse to accept notions of ""It can't be done"" or ""We can't do it"". With today's technology and talented people, we can accomplish anything... And that's where we need your help to finish the final software development and application.</p>
<h1><strong>NOW YOU NO LONGER HAVE TO IMAGINE IT!</strong></h1>
<p><strong>How does the TRAKET GPS MAPPING APP work?</strong></p>
<p>The <strong>TRAKET GPS Mapping APP</strong> will allow the caretaker or parent to:</p>
<p>• Find the location of the person with a GPS enabled device at anytime, without having to contact a call center or 3rd party. But if you need assistance, we are here 24/7 to assist you.</p>
<p>• Click on the<strong> TRAKET</strong> icon which will take you to a secured site. Enter your password and your registered GPS Device page will come up with a Google map showing the location of the GPS device. On the profile page, you will have the option of entering information to include; a picture of the user, physical description, medical information, address, emergency contact information, etc. This information can be useful in an emergency situation.</p>
<p>• Monitor multiple devices at the same time, on the same page.</p>
<p>• ""LOCATE NOW""- Click on their picture on the control panel and their present location will appear.</p>
<p>• ""Bread Crumbs""- Click Bread crumbs and the the route they took during a pre-determined time period to their present location will appear. This can be set up in 30sec, 1min, 5min, 10min, 30min or 1hour intervals.</p>
<p>• The <strong>TRAKET</strong> page is also where you can set virtual boundaries. You can put a box around your house, neighborhood or even school on the map, and when the wearer leaves that box, a text message is sent to you. </p>
<div class=""template asset""><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/000/055/952/9d9bf26c8828e248dd629195ea60d878_large.jpg?1341430884"" src="""" style=""""/></div>
<p><strong>Customer Service, Emergency Assistance and Warranty.</strong></p>
<p>• Customer satisfaction is very important to us. We will be providing a 24/7 year round Customer Service line to assist you with any questions or technical assistance regarding the <strong>TRAKET GPS Mapping APP</strong>.</p>
<p>• We also offer an Unprecedented Emergency Assistance service. Is your loved one missing but has a registered GPS Device with them and you are not sure what to do? If you are unable to or don't have access to Google Maps to locate him, we can do that for you. We will also assist you with contacting your local Law Enforcement Agency, Search &amp; Rescue agency and cooperate with those agencies until you and your loved one are reunited.</p>
<p>• 90 Day Warranty- Should any technical defect occur due to improper materials or workmanship, the same shall be made good at NO cost to Owner.</p>
<p><strong>Indiegogo Community</strong></p>
<p>We are so excited and we hope you are too. Our TEAM has worked long and hard to design from conception, research and conducted surveys on the most usable features to get to where we are today. We have included some very generous rewards, because we want you to be part of the success. We're not a big manufacturing corporation with deep pockets but rather, like you, a hard working team of people who want to make this world a safer place. We are at the stage of software development, applying the concepts, and writing the codes, to formulate everything into an APP which will be the link between the device and our servers. This is an expensive task that we have taken, but with you taking advantage of this pre-sale opportunity, we will be able to complete our project to make our <strong>TRAKET GPS Mapping APP</strong>available for everyone.</p>
<p> We look forward to tweeking it with your help and suggestions along the way in order for you to take advantage of those refinements on the first run.</p>

* JUST IMAGINE... Your child is in distress, flat tire, car broken down, injured etc., so they activate an SOS alert from the device they are using... All of a sudden, an alarm goes off on your cell phone, the wall monitor, or any other device associated with your secured APP. Instantly, the TRAKET APP is activated and the location of your child, indicated by a flashing red beacon, appears on the map. (CAN YOUR APP DO THAT?)
* JUST IMAGINE... Someone mistakenly takes your cellphone or your vehicle...Reality check! Someone steals your cellphone or vehicle. You can contact the police, and in real time, give them the location of where it is located the direction of travel, speed or where it has stopped. (CAN YOUR APP DO THAT?)
* JUST IMAGINE... Your child is about to take their first class trip out of state. You now can rest easy knowing that at any time you can see their exact location via google maps. GPS devices can be used anywhere in the world, including cities, deserts, oceans, lakes, mountains, or anywhere else a disoriented individual or adventurous traveler may find himself.
* JUST IMAGINE... Athletic Training Mapping- when you come back from your 3 mile run, you can print out the route you took, distance, time and speed. (CAN YOUR APP DO THAT?)
* JUST IMAGINE... Your child decides to hitchhike,  or ride his bike across the country. You would be able to follow them and see their location at any time through the TRAKET APP. You can program the TRAKET APP to notify you when they reach pre-determined checkpoints, or if they don't reach those locations by the expected time. (CAN YOUR APP DO THAT?)
* JUST IMAGINE... You may have someone with Alzheimers/Dementia or Autism who's at risk for wandering. You can set up virtual boundaries around your house or neighborhood, set to activate at predetermined times. If  your loved one goes outside the boundary when it's activated, the TRAKET APP alarm is activated, and the location of your loved one, indicated by a flashing red beacon, appears on the map. (CAN YOUR APP DO THAT?)
Our Motto is: ""IT CAN BE DONE""
We refuse to accept notions of ""It can't be done"" or ""We can't do it"". With today's technology and talented people, we can accomplish anything... And that's where we need your help to finish the final software development and application.
NOW YOU NO LONGER HAVE TO IMAGINE IT!
How does the TRAKET GPS MAPPING APP work?
The TRAKET GPS Mapping APP will allow the caretaker or parent to:
• Find the location of the person with a GPS enabled device at anytime, without having to contact a call center or 3rd party. But if you need assistance, we are here 24/7 to assist you.
• Click on the TRAKET icon which will take you to a secured site. Enter your password and your registered GPS Device page will come up with a Google map showing the location of the GPS device. On the profile page, you will have the option of entering information to include; a picture of the user, physical description, medical information, address, emergency contact information, etc. This information can be useful in an emergency situation.
• Monitor multiple devices at the same time, on the same page.
• ""LOCATE NOW""- Click on their picture on the control panel and their present location will appear.
• ""Bread Crumbs""- Click Bread crumbs and the the route they took during a pre-determined time period to their present location will appear. This can be set up in 30sec, 1min, 5min, 10min, 30min or 1hour intervals.
• The TRAKET page is also where you can set virtual boundaries. You can put a box around your house, neighborhood or even school on the map, and when the wearer leaves that box, a text message is sent to you. 

Customer Service, Emergency Assistance and Warranty.
• Customer satisfaction is very important to us. We will be providing a 24/7 year round Customer Service line to assist you with any questions or technical assistance regarding the TRAKET GPS Mapping APP.
• We also offer an Unprecedented Emergency Assistance service. Is your loved one missing but has a registered GPS Device with them and you are not sure what to do? If you are unable to or don't have access to Google Maps to locate him, we can do that for you. We will also assist you with contacting your local Law Enforcement Agency, Search & Rescue agency and cooperate with those agencies until you and your loved one are reunited.
• 90 Day Warranty- Should any technical defect occur due to improper materials or workmanship, the same shall be made good at NO cost to Owner.
Indiegogo Community
We are so excited and we hope you are too. Our TEAM has worked long and hard to design from conception, research and conducted surveys on the most usable features to get to where we are today. We have included some very generous rewards, because we want you to be part of the success. We're not a big manufacturing corporation with deep pockets but rather, like you, a hard working team of people who want to make this world a safer place. We are at the stage of software development, applying the concepts, and writing the codes, to formulate everything into an APP which will be the link between the device and our servers. This is an expensive task that we have taken, but with you taking advantage of this pre-sale opportunity, we will be able to complete our project to make our TRAKET GPS Mapping APPavailable for everyone.
 We look forward to tweeking it with your help and suggestions along the way in order for you to take advantage of those refinements on the first run.
Thank you so much Indiegogo Community
 
QUESTION: Why is the amount on the ""Early Birds"" the same as ""The Package but the Perk is different?
ANSWER: When the ""Early Bird"" was written, the amount was wrong. Since we put it up and someone pledged that amount, we can't change, delete or correct it. The faithful pledger will receive the same perk as ""The Package"".",2.0,0,"1 Campaign

about coalatree
Coalatree started on a rural farm in Western Colorado by a group of friends on a journey to create sustainably sourced apparel and multi-use products. We’ve since grown, moved to Utah, and left the farm behind, but our commitment to environmental responsibility and the values we cultivated and have stayed with us.Sustainability is behind everything we do. By working only with bluesign® approved facilities, we consider our environmental impact in every step of production, minimizing our impact in design, testing, manufacturing, distribution, and shipping.The Trailhead Adventure Shorts, like the pants, are constructed from a combination of ripstop nylon and polyester mechanical stretch, both made from recycled materials. Surplus yarns and plastic bottles are smashed, melted, and spun into new fibers that are woven together to create this innovative fabric.Our factory partners are working towards zero emissions through green initiatives such as gray water recycling, energy-saving ventilation, solar and energy-efficient lighting, on-site wetlands and green spaces, and much more.Conventional manufacturing methods use toxic chemicals, produce hazardous waste, and contribute significantly to carbon emissions. We work only with facilities that are bluesign® approved, ensuring the highest standards are met in efficiency, safety, and clean manufacturing.Our hangtags and packaging are printed on recycled paper with post-consumer waste content, keeping trash out of landfills and preserving our forests. 
 
  Who We AreCoalatree designs eco-minded gear and apparel for the adventurer in everyone, from athletes and photographers to your average city folks and weekend warriors. It’s our passion to bring elements of the outdoors and the city life together. Whether you’re summiting the tallest peaks or lounging around town with friends, our products are practical, stylish, and functional. Being ready for anything is what we’re all about.Greet the OutdoorsTo us, a MTN2CTY lifestyle is one of adventure, freedom, and ease. We wake up early to catch sunrise on a ridge before seamlessly transitioning into the office. We’re out on the town on a Friday night with friends then up for dawn patrol on powder days. To Greet the Outdoors is to be ready to pack our bags, hit the road, run the trails, and explore.Our GivebackEach year we use surplus fabric to create warm blankets for the homeless in our hometown of Salt Lake City, Utah. We also partner with local organizations to maintain the hiking and biking trails we frequent and to protect the integrity of our watersheds.",50.0,0,"11 Campaigns

<p align=""left"">Portability and ease of use are two of the key phrases we bore in mind throughout the whole process of developing DIVA, as we see how drones are getting more integrated into our daily life. Nevertheless, DIVA’s performance is not compromised by its compact body, as we gave it the vision of a 4K aerial camera and a battery life of 26m. Built upon our rich experience in industrial design, DIVA is streamlined to very minimeter. Meanwhile, the aerodynamic body was enhanced by strategically positioned lines and bones so each DIVA drone is built to endure and last.</p>

Portability and ease of use are two of the key phrases we bore in mind throughout the whole process of developing DIVA, as we see how drones are getting more integrated into our daily life. Nevertheless, DIVA’s performance is not compromised by its compact body, as we gave it the vision of a 4K aerial camera and a battery life of 26m. Built upon our rich experience in industrial design, DIVA is streamlined to very minimeter. Meanwhile, the aerodynamic body was enhanced by strategically positioned lines and bones so each DIVA drone is built to endure and last.

Calm is a patent pending, in-ear Noise Blocking & Hearing Protection for dogs!  Calm is made of a special formulated memory foam and veterinarian approved.It was created for dogs that have noise phobia, noise anxiety from thunderstorms, fireworks or other loud noises, and for dogs that are in situations where they will need noise blocking & hearing protection.It has a shape that is specifically created for a dog’s ear canal that fits dogs from chihuahuas to great danes! 
Noise Blocking
Hearing Protection
Dogs can relax and be calm
Easy to use and effective, 31 NRR
Comfortable & stays in place 
Veterinarian approved
We all know dogs can hear better than us.....5x better! They live in this same, loud, world with us. We protect our hearing when in places that could damage our hearing, and now we can do the same for our loyal companions...our dogs! Provides Protection Against:    
Fireworks
Thunderstorms 
Private Planes and Helicopters
Loud, public spaces, ie: Concerts, city noises, traffic
Every dog shape, size and breed!Including all: Therapy dogs, working dogs, Military dogs, Law Enforcement dogs, and Search & Rescue dogs! It’s so simple! The training to accept Calm is as easy as teaching them to sit, roll over, or stay! All you have to do is gently pull up on the dog's ear to elongate the ear canals. Insert Calm until it is flush into the ear canal opening and then release the ear.See how easy it is to do this!                                                    It’s as easy as training your dog to sit, shake or stay! Each dog is different. It can range from a day to a few days. Just keep working with them. Keep the training sessions short and sweet. 5 minutes to start.  (treats are always good incentives, too!) Soon they realize you are helping them and will accept them with no problems. 
 
CrittEar Pack:We all came together because of our love for dogs! We all wanted to solve a very common problem. We want to keep dogs safe. We all knew that current solutions, like medications and isolation weren’t really solving the problem. We knew that together, we could offer a safe alternative that would make dogs, and their families, happier and safer. Who Created Calm by CrittEar? Like you, I am a dog lover – I have four! Over that last few years, I’ve noticed my older golden retriever becoming more and more sensitive to sounds and loud noises. I tried everything; cotton, people foam ear protection, tight shirts, over the counter medication, seclusion, & more, but nothing worked. I felt helpless! I also noticed that it wasn’t just my dog. I need to help these dogs! The light bulb went off! I HAVE AN IDEA!  The rest is history and Calm by CrittEar was born!   100% Production, Manufacturing, Logistics!We want to be able to get all the sizes made during the campaign. We want to help all the different fur family members we can help!  With your help, we will do it!    
Don’t Have Dogs? Can’t Contribute Right Now? You Can Still Help In A Big Way!

Pack your Voyage Pillow before you head out the doorAt more than 50% smaller than the traditional U-Shape Pillow, save the space you need to bring more of the things that will help make your trip memorable.Size Comparison: Voyage Pillow vs. Traditional Travel PillowDitch the cumbersome size and shape of traditional travel pillows for the discreet form factor of the Voyage Pillow when running to catch that connecting flight. Carry-on Size Comparison: Voyage Pillow vs. Traditional Travel PillowThe compact size and pillow construction allows the Voyage Pillow to weigh only 2.5 oz. Simply grab and go with your luggage at the airport.Effortlessly attach the Voyage Pillow to your carry on luggage when racing to catch that connecting flight through the airport! Quickly Attach it to a Carry-On Bag Everyone has a different go to sleeping position when traveling. The Voyage Pillow is able to adapt to your preferred sleeping position while allowing for flexibility to shift around and change positions with ease without the pillow slipping or falling out of place.Place the Voyage Pillow over your eyes, on the side of your head, around your neck, under your chin, around your hand, behind your back, between your legs, or whatever else might work so you can get the best sleep possible!Never lose the Voyage Pillow on the go, easily drop is around your neck when you wake up from a nap and dash off to board the plane.
Take it on the go around your neckWhen you are stuck with that dreaded two hour delay on your connecting flight - take out the Voyage Pillow, sprawl out, and take a nap in the terminal. One of the main goals when I was developing the Voyage Pillow was to find fabrics and materials that felt amazing to the touch, complimented the functional design, and looked great as a final product. After testing and experimenting with different fabrics and combinations, the perfect balance of these attributes was found.  The Voyage Pillow features a polyester/spandex blended fabric exterior for flexibility and comfort in any sleeping situation. This allows for the pillow to comfortably fit almost every head shape - large or small. The heather fabric design adds a touch of style and depth to each colorway available.   
Poly/Spandex Stretch FabricThe interior is finished with the softest plush fabric for a gentle feel against your skin while your sleep. The solid colors create a visually appealing two tone design.Plush Polyester InteriorLastly thousands of microbeads fill the Voyage Pillow to perfect sculpt to your unique sleep position. This construction allows the pillow to adjust to the pressure of being used while snapping back to retain it's shape at the end of that perfect nap.

Start getting the rest you deserve with the Voyage Pillow A few key influencers have been taking the Voyage Pillow on their trips and can't get enough!       After years of traveling all around the world to New York, Paris, Stockholm, San Francisco, Montreal, Dominican Republic, Lake Tahoe, Chile, New Zealand, and more - I was absolutely hooked on traveling but hated actually getting to the location and losing a day from horrible sleep on the plane. I became determined to find a better solution for sleeping on the go. Traveling the WorldI found that traditional travel pillows on the market were bulky and designed for only sleeping in one particular position. So in May of 2016, I began sketching designs, cutting up pillows, and sewing my own creations. Once I had developed my initial prototype I began looking for a manufacturing partner to bring the Voyage Pillow to life. Manufacturing Partner Production FacilityDifferent sample designs allowed me to test various fabrics, pillow densities, pillow fill materials, size, shape, and more. I spent the next four months working closely with a leading travel pillow manufacturer tweaking the design until it was absolutely perfect.  
Progression of SamplesOnce the final design was chosen I hopped back on planes, trains, buses, and taxis to put in some miles on testing the final pre-production design. On these trips I began studying airport displays to develop eye-catch packaging and picturing the Voyage Pillow on their shelves!Retail Packaging ConceptLastly I wanted the final delivery of the Voyage Pillows to our backers to be just as beautiful with custom poly mailers!Sondre Travel Poly MailersHave a question, interested in featuring the Voyage Pillow, or simply want to just say hi?! Send an e-mail to info@sondretravel.com!     After months of planning, designing, and testing the Voyage Pillow, I am extremely excited to be finally launching the Kickstarter campaign for the backers. This timeline helps show the path that led to this launch as well as the next few months after the campaign when you can expect the rewards! Be the first to get your hands on the Voyage Pillow and back the project today!",45.0,0,"3 Campaigns

It requires lots of ice, doesn’t keep beverages cold for long, and turns into a messy box of sloshing water quickly. Those old coolers are also inconveniently bulky, garishly coloured, and stylishly outdated.That's why we made iFreezer Go20, a true dual-zone portable cooler and freezer with incredible performance and astonishing design. It is simple to use, energy efficient, and provides reliable refrigeration and freezing to keep your food and drinks cold & refreshing.      Fridge And Freezer It’s a fridge, a freezer or both at the same time! With the Independent Dual Zone design, iFreezer Go20 offers two independently controlled zones to ensure extended preservation of your fresh foods and beverages. Use the App to set your zones and get cool. Precise Temperature ControlPrecisely control and monitor temperature +/-1.8°F (-1°C) via digital display and touch operation. Ensure food and drinks stay within the appropriate temperature range. Advanced refrigeration technology from Germany to refrigerate or freeze up -0.4°F (-18°C).Dry & CleanNo more melted ice in bulky coolers. You can keep your fridge dry and clean! Featuring removable dividers for optimal organization and an independent dual zone design, you can store your ice creams and beers in the SAME fridge at the SAME time! It’s totally a space saver and a game changer!Ready To PartyiFreezer Go20 maintains accurate temperatures from 50℉ (10°C) to 0℉ (-18°C) with a 20L storage space. It’s able to hold 9 bottles of red wine (25 OZ / 750mL), or 29 cans of coke (12 FL OZ / 355mL). Or any delicious combination of food and fun! All truly great products consider form as well as function. iFreezer Go20 was designed differently to reflect the modern lifestyle – using a sleek minimalist design and a style that complements today’s automobiles combined with the latest technology for versatility, convenience, and performance.  
Great Design Meets Great Functionality
 
Portable & Compact
Unlike previous generations of car coolers that are bulky and heavy, iFreezer Go20 weighs just 10.8KG and with comfortable, built-in handles, it is easy to load and stores easily in any sized vehicle. 

SECOP (Danfoss) Compressor
The type of compressor we are using is SECOP (Danfoss) BD1.4F-VSD. The compressor we used is 60% smaller than its rivals and weighs in at only 2.3 kilos. With 42 Ip class and 5W (12V) fan, it is enabled to provide energy efficient, sustainable and smart performance. This specially designed compressor ensured maximum efficiency and reliability for iFreezer Go20. The optimized, low noise motor ensures outstanding performance for iFreezer Go20 when we need that extra degree of luxury on the move.

Smart Control
For ultimate convenience in the palm of your hand, iFreezer Go20 can be controlled and monitored by smartphone. The helpful iFreezer App also suggests the proper temperature settings for different foods and beverages so that all your refreshments remain at the perfect temp with just one-click!
 

 
Plug-and-go
iFreezer is easy to operate. Simply plug it into your car’s 12V cigarette lighter power point and hit the road. Forget going to the store over and over again for ice. Just begin driving and begin cooling. Concentrate on the fun not the cooler for your next adventure.

IT’S THE ONLY BACKPACK LARGE AND SECURE ENOUGH TO CARRY YOUR LARGE GEAR</strong> - It’s a backpack in its own class, the 95L rucksack. Large enough to hold any gear up to 23 inches (58cm) tall by 23 inches wide (58cm) by 11 inches deep (28cm) and support up to 70 pounds (31.75 kilos) of weight. Additionally, each backpack comes outfitted with our innovative cube system, or get upgrade to the hardshell for even more protection. The two-inch interior nylon strap securely locks the interior shell to ensure you’re gear is extremely secure during transportation.</p><p><strong>2. CARRIES ALL YOUR GEAR, ACCESSORIES AND THEN SOME </strong>- Yes, the primary compartment is gigantic, but we’ve also added four other compartments to carry your other gear from cords to peripherals to clothes and pretty much anything you may need to transport, there’s room for just about everything including the kitchen sink. This includes: two front pockets, a large middle pocket. Finally, behind the primary compartment is a small sleeve to hold thin lined items such as laptops, tables, or magazines.</p><p><strong>3. ERGONOMIC AND COMFORTABLE </strong>- We realized that carrying large gear could be awkward, to offset this we’ve positioned the straps and added plenty of cushioning to provide an ergonomic design that contours to your shoulders and back. Additionally, we've added a chest and waist strap for added support.</p><p><strong>4. BUILT TOUGH </strong>- We know your gear has to be protected, period. The entire backpack is constructed of military-strength 900D Nylon that is tear and water resistant, and able to hold up to 70 pounds (31.75 kilos). We’ve padded the primary compartment, lined the interior with fleece and added a specialized rubber base to provide waterproof protection. Finally, we know you’ll be zipping and unzipping a lot, which is why we’ve installed premium, seamless SBS zippers for a smooth open and close every time.</p><p><strong>5. CUSTOMIZE, MODIFY, MAKE IT YOURS</strong> - We wanted to offer a bag that has the ability to extend beyond just the backpack and be customized to fit your personality and needs. This is the primary reason we decided to create a backpack that leverages military-style Molle tactical loops and Velcro strips. The Molle system allow you to add extra components to extend the functionality and storage of your GTR-1. Additionally, customize your GTR-1 backpack to your liking by adding your favorite Velcro patches.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1540351335/b6omoql0jkjl7wm2gflq.jpg"" src=""""/>  </p><h3>DETAILED SPECIFICATIONS</h3><h3><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1540329977/cz5hpnsg7q3yagvzsnpn.jpg"" src=""""/></h3><p><strong>Size/Weight Specifications:</strong></p><ul>

<li>Large Carabiner that can attach to any fender</li>
<li>Quick-switch clip, allowing for multiple use cases for the cleat and instant adjustment</li>
</ul> <p>Our Freedom Cleat is no regular suction cup. <strong>Able to hold up to 250lbs</strong> and including an attached D-Ring, it is perfect for hanging fenders over the boat, holding wet boat ropes out to dry, as well as carrying any other boating products. </p>
<p>The Freedom Cleat Adjustable Fender System features an auto-adjust clip and cinch for easily adjusting the height of your fender.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></h3>
<p>We are currently seeking to raise $10,000 to help market and advertise the Freedom Cleat and put the finishing touches on our website and packaging. Our prototype is complete with the model done and product on the way. We are launching on Indiegogo to get the Freedom Cleat in the hands of all boaters by September 1, 2021.</p>

<h3><strong>Stick it. Lock it. Let it Hang</strong></h3>
<p>Our team loves boating. We created the Freedom Cleat out of a necessity for a better way to use fenders on a boat. It always seemed that wherever we needed a fender, there was never a cleat in the place we needed it. We developed the Freedom Cleat to be the easiest way to use a boat cleat. Just place the Freedom Cleat. Lock it into place, and let your fender hang over the gunnel, per usual. That is it.</p>
<p>We tested method after method and prototype on top of prototype of ways to secure and adjust a fender, and we believe we have developed the best way. The Freedom Cleat is the tried and true ultimate cleat and fender system.</p>

<p>Our company has the ambition to break down the barriers that exist between Russia and you. We start by designing new authentic, immersive, and eco-responsible tours in Russia.

<p>Our mission is to convince foreigners to come discover Russia, far from clichés, so they can enjoy Russia's incredible natural and cultural highlights. We have trips that go to the Far north, in search of Northern Lights, to Baikal Lake, Altai, Caucasus, and even to Vladivostok. With us, your guide will also be a  Russian teacher, it means that you will get an initiation to the Russian language during the journey.

A reminder, the deadline is in only a few days - get the perks while you still can!<br/><br/><h3>Short Summary of My Campaign
</h3>
<p>Hey, I'm Dominik, a 17 year old Canadian student from a less well-off family. I'm very passionate about writing, history, politics, music, different cultures, people, and art of all kinds! </p>
<p>This March Break I will hopefully be going on an extensive journalism trip that will be an amazing, unique opportunity for me, and you can be part of it. <br/><br/>Beginning in Madrid, Spain, I will be travelling through Barcelona, southern France (Provence and the French Riviera), as well as the cities of Pisa, Florence, Assisi, and Rome in Italy. A quick glance on the perks to the right will show you what I will be sharing to my contributors.<br/><br/></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1454184079/t2lnbg5vvgi3rgdmnl94.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h3>More details <br/>
</h3>
<p>(For those brave souls that dare read long paragraphs of text)</p>
<p></p>
<p>For a few years now it's been my goal to write and get to travel to Europe to study its culture and people - the land of Hannibal and Caesar, Michelangelo and Da Vinci, Machiavelli and Descartes, Beethoven, Debussy, Napoleon Bonaparte, and how that relates to modern times. Thousands of years of history which were instrumental in creating the great world we live in now. Additionally, now with the recent migrant crisis I'm interested in observing it firsthand.<br/>From March 9 to March 20, 2016  my school is organizing a trip to Spain, Southern France, and Italy. Beginning in Madrid, it will go through Barcelona, Provence, Nice (the French Riviera), Pisa, Florence, Assisi, and Rome. It is a chance to finally visit Southern Europe and learn about it firsthand, but it comes with a hefty price tag that is very hard to get in my situation: $3450.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>Reporting<br/>
</h3>
<p><br/>Europe is one of the most beautiful and fascinating places in the world. It is also undergoing a definite crisis or at least, a critical moment in 2016 - both within the European Union and with the onset of massive immigration.</p>I will be writing on numerous topics. My key focuses will be: <br/>1) History of the Region (this includes art and architecture) <br/>2) The Legacy and Remnants of the Roman Empire<br/> 3) The Migrant Crisis<br/> as well as major attractions, interesting things I see, custom reports of my donors, and any unplanned topics I might feel compelled to write about.

<div><span style=""background-color: initial;"">With the trip fully funded I will be able to fulfill my vision, practice my journalistic skills firsthand, where I will be exposed to a completely different reality, while you will get the opportunity to participate in my trip through the perks, getting great insights, professional reports, and fascinating photography from Southern Europe.</span></div>
<p></p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<div>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">To be confirmed on the trip, I need $3450 by early February 2016 paid to EF Tours. $2500 of that I hope to raise through crowdfunding. Any funds over the limit will be used for trip expenses not included in the trip price such as lunch, attending special interesting events, and paying for souvenirs and associated costs for my donors.</span>
</div>
<div>I will do my best to give the most value that I can for your funding. </div>
<div>Depending on the perk you choose, you have the options for some or all of the following:<br/><ul>
<li>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">un-copyrighted HD photos of the architecture, landscape or culture</span><br/>
</li>
<li>a Travel Journal - the concise, illustrated report on the places I visit</li>
<li>some or all of the following reports: Migrant Crisis, Roman Empire, History of the Region</li>
<li>Daily E-mail featuring Photo of the Day and Fun Fact of the Day during my trip</li>
<li>custom report on anything related to the parts of southwestern Europe I visit</li>
<li>a souvenir</li>
<li>Post Cards sent from Barcelona, Nice, and Rome</li>
<li>travel guide - what to visit and where to eat</li>
</ul>
<div>Examples of souvenirs: shot glasses, figurines of landmarks,etc.</div>
<div><br/></div>
Gaudi's at times comical and fantastical architecture is a key feature of Barcelona:<br/>

<h3>The Impact<span style=""font-size: 16px; line-height: 26px; background-color: initial;"">                                </span>
</h3>
<div>Funding my trip will allow me to go on an extraordinary journey and be able to practice my journalistic skills. Travelling will give me a better understanding of the world which I will then apply in all my future undertakings. I think travelling could benefit anyone anywhere.<br/><br/>Best of all, it will give you an awesome experience as well - photos, comments, and reports on the entire region.</div>
</div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p>If you can't pitch in even $3, I would really appreciate it if you could spread the word and share.</p>
<h3>Equipment</h3>
<div>For photographs and videos I will be using a Canon T3i. For daily e-mails and notes I will be bringing a laptop and associated materials. </div>

This March Break I will hopefully be going on an extensive journalism trip that will be an amazing, unique opportunity for me, and you can be part of it. Beginning in Madrid, Spain, I will be travelling through Barcelona, southern France (Provence and the French Riviera), as well as the cities of Pisa, Florence, Assisi, and Rome in Italy. A quick glance on the perks to the right will show you what I will be sharing to my contributors.

More details 

(For those brave souls that dare read long paragraphs of text)

For a few years now it's been my goal to write and get to travel to Europe to study its culture and people - the land of Hannibal and Caesar, Michelangelo and Da Vinci, Machiavelli and Descartes, Beethoven, Debussy, Napoleon Bonaparte, and how that relates to modern times. Thousands of years of history which were instrumental in creating the great world we live in now. Additionally, now with the recent migrant crisis I'm interested in observing it firsthand.From March 9 to March 20, 2016  my school is organizing a trip to Spain, Southern France, and Italy. Beginning in Madrid, it will go through Barcelona, Provence, Nice (the French Riviera), Pisa, Florence, Assisi, and Rome. It is a chance to finally visit Southern Europe and learn about it firsthand, but it comes with a hefty price tag that is very hard to get in my situation: $3450.

Reporting

Europe is one of the most beautiful and fascinating places in the world. It is also undergoing a definite crisis or at least, a critical moment in 2016 - both within the European Union and with the onset of massive immigration.I will be writing on numerous topics. My key focuses will be: 1) History of the Region (this includes art and architecture) 2) The Legacy and Remnants of the Roman Empire 3) The Migrant Crisis as well as major attractions, interesting things I see, custom reports of my donors, and any unplanned topics I might feel compelled to write about. 

The Pont du Gard, a 2000 year old Roman aqueduct and bridge:


With the trip fully funded I will be able to fulfill my vision, practice my journalistic skills firsthand, where I will be exposed to a completely different reality, while you will get the opportunity to participate in my trip through the perks, getting great insights, professional reports, and fascinating photography from Southern Europe.
   What We Need & What You Get

To be confirmed on the trip, I need $3450 by early February 2016 paid to EF Tours. $2500 of that I hope to raise through crowdfunding. Any funds over the limit will be used for trip expenses not included in the trip price such as lunch, attending special interesting events, and paying for souvenirs and associated costs for my donors.

I will do my best to give the most value that I can for your funding. 
Depending on the perk you choose, you have the options for some or all of the following:

un-copyrighted HD photos of the architecture, landscape or culture

a Travel Journal - the concise, illustrated report on the places I visit
some or all of the following reports: Migrant Crisis, Roman Empire, History of the Region
Daily E-mail featuring Photo of the Day and Fun Fact of the Day during my trip
custom report on anything related to the parts of southwestern Europe I visit
a souvenir
Post Cards sent from Barcelona, Nice, and Rome
travel guide - what to visit and where to eat

Examples of souvenirs: shot glasses, figurines of landmarks,etc.

Gaudi's at times comical and fantastical architecture is a key feature of Barcelona:

   
The Impact                                

Funding my trip will allow me to go on an extraordinary journey and be able to practice my journalistic skills. Travelling will give me a better understanding of the world which I will then apply in all my future undertakings. I think travelling could benefit anyone anywhere.Best of all, it will give you an awesome experience as well - photos, comments, and reports on the entire region.
  Other Ways You Can Help If you can't pitch in even $3, I would really appreciate it if you could spread the word and share.
Equipment
For photographs and videos I will be using a Canon T3i. For daily e-mails and notes I will be bringing a laptop and associated materials.",4.0,0,"1 Campaign

Designed with the outdoors in mind, we wanted to create a product that could be utilized by anyone, anywhere. 
From the avid adventure seeker to the family who spends summer nights at the park, the simplified design can be taken full advantage of with it's 3-in-1 capabilities. 
From hammock to beach blanket to rain fly within seconds, the TREEO is the Swiss Army Knife of hammocks.





The real magic behind the TREEO is the Quick Draw Cord System inspired by the simple draw-string backpack. By pulling the cords tight on each end, it creates the hammock function which then attaches to the tree strap and carabiner.





The guy lines hang the TREEO high above to escape sun or rain.





And finally, by pulling the cords apart and staking each corner down, the TREEO can be used as a beach blanket or ground cloth.

Just properly done. We're so smart about money at home, but on the road we set ourselves back decades with awkward wads of cash, or money belts that mark us as easy pickings. Slab will keep you safe by not showing people more than they need to see. 
And it’s MADE IN CANADA because we like to support local people and communities.







The Story



I love the minimalistic wallet designs that have been flourishing on Kickstarter over the last couple of years. They’re amazing for home and give you easy access to your cards and the occasional folded bill. However, when you’re overseas, cash rules.

I like wallets.


Over the last five years, I have lived in China, Indonesia, Vietnam, Hong Kong, the Philippines, and Thailand. Only cash can give you piece of mind in these countries. Unfortunately, the petty theft rate is really high.
In one unnamed Asian country, I heard stories about tourists paying for their purchases at convenience stores, not knowing that thieves were checking out their wallets. After they left the shop, their wallets would get stolen a block down the road.
I used a bi-fold wallet for a bit, but then I encountered a police officer in another unnamed Asian country and he levied a ""fine” on the spot. I pulled out my wallet, and when he saw some big bills, my ""fine” doubled.We’re often our own victims. I was hiding cash in my cargo shorts and created a complicated system of different bills in different pockets. In the end, I lost quite a bit of money in taxis, nightclubs, and restaurants because bills stuck to my phone or hands and fell out.And in countries where every traveler is a “millionaire” (example: one million Vietnamese dong comes out to fifty bucks), some of the small bills and the big bills look the same at a glance. If you’re new to a country, what’s to stop you from giving 100,000 when you actually owe 10,000?I asked myself a question: How can I organize my small bills for small purchases and have the big bills when I need them, all in the same wallet – but NOT have others see them?

Prototypes.
After nine months of different ideas, prototypes, and errors, I invented the SLAB: a three-plate magic wallet with RFID protection that can trick observers, keep your cash hidden and carry necessities for your cell phone (SIM cards and a SIM card removal tool for the iPhone).
I used almost a hundred year old design introduced by French and put a little twist on it...

American Edition (10.5cm x 7.5 cm) and Euro Edition (10.5 cm x 8.5 cm)



SIM card holder and SIM removal tool
Double gripping, strong elastic to keep your cards and cash in place.
Strong rare-earth magnets keep the plates aligned and will not affect your cards. 

IMPORTANT:
We use strong magnets in our wallet. The magnetic field is very narrow. Your credit card (with a magnetic stripe) is safe when you put it in, take it out and store it (i.e., regular use). HOWEVER, IT MIGHT DEMAGNETIZE if you SWIPE IT AGAINST MAGNET. Don't do that. We can't be responsible for loss of your card. Your chip, RFID and ID cards are totally safe, though.



Magic Wallet (2-Plate design):
When you go back home and don't need the ""hiding"" feature, you can just remove the central plate and convert SLAB into traditional Magic Wallet.
Remove the centre plate to create a traditional Magic Wallet.



Opened Magic Wallet.

Keep just a card and ID for a minimalistic profile.

Fixed Funding, Why?The funds we require will be to build high quality prototypes with engineering documents.  We believe that if fans want to help, they'll help raise the funds. If they don't then why make the tent to begin with.If not all funds are reached there is no campaign, and no prototypes will be built!  This campaign must succeed in order to create this.ADDITIONAL TENT ACCESSORIES
Solar power bundles will be created with ability to power small fans, phones, and lights.

over 8 pockets for storage
Solar powered FAN addons will keep airflow moving, keeping temperatures cool!

Water resistant material to block rain
Sweet Nacelles Carrying Case (The engine turns into the carrying case! I think this is one of the best things I've seen, and this is why I want to make it a reality for so many fans to enjoy!)
What's Next?If this campaign is successful then the next steps will be to create all 10 working prototype tents with accessories.   Once the prototypes are complete and ready, we will open another round of crowdfunding on IndieGoGo to produce the Shuttlecraft Tent for all the fans who put in an order! If you signed up for this campaign you'll receive your discount off the public released version.  If you donated to this campaign, you will receive the corresponding perk, or discount towards the public released product!   Thank you. If you can donate great, if you can share even better!  Either way may you...Live long and prosper.",9.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Let's face it, drones are cool, but drone landing pads...not so much. They're not something you think much about...until you really need one. As drone enthusiasts, we've hauled cardboard, tarps, and even the wife's yoga mat out to the field, only to find there were limitations. Cardboard is too light, tarps need rocks to hold them down, and the wife's yoga mat....it always tends to curl up...and, well, it's pink. Backpacks are great for storing your drone's gear, but just too expensive to sling in the mud and takeoff from. We've spent the last two years studying this gap in the market, and focusing on what would make the best drone landing pad for pilots now, and in the future. We're ready to share our vision with the world and finally make a drone landing pad that is just as cool as the drone sitting on it. Help us bring a SPOT to every pilot, to every camera operator, to every racer, and help us to keep our drone flying fun, safe, and clean. </p>
<p><span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'>Why do you need a drone landing pad, again?</span></p>
<p>The video pretty much sums it up, but overall a drone landing pad protects your drone from dirt and debris, protects it from sudden landing impacts (they happen), keeps it on the level (needed for sensor calibration during takeoff), keeps it out of the mud (which means you can fly in any terrain), and extends the overall life of your drone.  If that alone doesn't motivate you, then keep in mind that taking off from a SPOT will at least make it 'look' like you're a professional ...even if your flying says otherwise. </p>
<p>So why do we need your help?</p>
<p>We've successfully built proto runs and tested all of the SPOT models shown here, but need to meet minimum order quantities to bring the SPOT series of pads to the masses at a reasonable price. The money we raise here will go towards ordering mass quantities of all the models, as well as funding protos of our next product the SPOT X, which we are planning on introducing Q1 2017. If we don't meet our full goal, we will still fulfill all orders, and partial funding will go towards mass production of the most popular SPOT model. </p>
<p>What's the Spot X?</p>
<p>Remember when we said we were thinking about the future? Well, the Spot X is a connected, open landing pad platform, that will integrate an array of sensors for specific drone applications. Think drone deliveries and racing applications. We have a patent pending for the current SPOT designs, as well as the SPOT X sensor platform. There is also a shot or two in the video if you want a sneak peek. </p>

<p>OffVentures is for people who like to leave well-trodden paths and explore remote regions of the world. We know that transport is a big issue in these regions – if guided tours exist at all they are usually expensive and follow a fixed schedule, so you're riding through the country as a tourist instead of diving into the real nature and culture of the area.</p>
<p>That's why we created OffVentures. We offer a means of transport through regions that are otherwise hard or even impossible to reach – with full flexibility! YOU decide when to hop on and hop off and add YOUR own dream destinations to the route. This way, everyone takes part in the planning, gets to save money and to enjoy some company along the way.</p>

<p>At its end, the bottle has a nipple and a one way valve inside that opens and closes while the baby is eating. Since no air enters, it prevents digestive problems. It is the only bottle that allows babies to sit and eat without raising their heads. It has no Bisphinol A (a toxic, cancerous substance). It does not drip, increases food safety (vacuum package) and is the lightest bottle available. The BabyTech bottle is great for hospital use for midnight bottle search and for family camping.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Need for New Disposable Baby Bottles</span></strong></p>
<p>Baby bottles in use today have numerous problems. <em>""The teats and screw tops of bottles trap germs which get into the milk and make the baby ill""</em> (World Health Organization). In addition, sterilizing and filling a baby bottle can present difficulties to parents, especially during trips and at night. Furthermore, current disposable bottles are limited, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Partially disposable - Sometimes, only parts of the bottles are disposable, such as just the nipples or just the liners.</li>
<li>Disposable with 'old' problems - Several inexpensive disposable bottles have the same inherent problems of standard bottles, such as filling is still difficult.</li>
<li>Limited to certain foods - There are disposable bottles that can work mainly with their own brand of foods or are pre-filled.</li>
<li>Mostly for trips - A recent solution collapses as the baby feeds, but, as the baby drinks, the bottle can go floppy, which cannot happen to BabyTech.</li>
</ul><p> </p>
<p><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">The BabyTech Bottle <br/></span></strong></p>
<p>Totally made of recyclable rubber, the bottle is composed of a nipple, valve and an inflating tube. The bottle is inflated with the baby's food and the valve stops the liquids from bursting out. When the baby drinks the valve opens, and when the baby stops, the valve closes again, on its own.</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 60px;""><img alt=""Before BabyTech bottle is filled"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/770449/pictures/full/20130422113744-Before.jpg?1366655873"" src="""" style="""" title=""Before""/></p>

<p>The bottle’s benefits include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Disposable </strong>- It allows parents to quickly return to sleep without searching for and washing bottles, which is also an extremely useful feature for trips as well as hospitals.</li>
<li>
<strong>Portable </strong>- The volume of a few BabyTech bottles is half of a standard bottle, which is useful for trips.</li>
<li>
<strong>Sterile </strong>- In addition to being disinfected and sterilized, the bottles are kept in hygienic packaging.</li>
<li>
<strong>Natural nursing feeling</strong> - Its soft touch (elastic material) gives a baby a feeling of natural nursing, making the transition from breastfeeding to a bottle much easier and smoother.</li>
<li>
<strong>Better digestion</strong> - The bottle prevents extra gases in a baby’s digestive system since no air enters it. It also allows eating while sitting (see below), which further improves digestion. As research has proven, when eating occurs while sitting the air is concentrated on the upper part of the digestive system and is thus immediately released at the end of feeding. However, when eating while lying down the air mixes with the food and causes the accumulation of gases in the digestive system, thereby requiring actions to release the gases (e.g. taps on the back for extended minutes).</li>
<li>
<strong>Safe eating while sitting</strong> - It is the only bottle that allows sitting babies to eat without raising their heads. The food is given to the baby at a controlled rate, making it much safer.</li>
<li>
<strong>Feeding is easy and fast</strong> - The BabyTech bottle achieves this by means of its controlled pressure and by preventing the known vacuum problem.</li>
<li>
<strong>Has no Bisphinol A</strong> - Many have raised concerns about the impact of this material on their child.</li>
<li>
<strong>Higher food safety</strong> - Due to the bottle's vacuum package, the food stays edible for a longer time. Tests also show that reducing the number of germs prevents disease and dental caries in gums/teeth.</li>
<li>
<strong>No dripping</strong> - The bottle's unique valve enables to feed a controlled dosage to a baby's mouth.</li>
<li>
<strong>Lightest bottle available</strong> - Totally made of rubber, the BabyTech bottle is the lightest on the market.</li>
<li>
<strong>Environmental friendly</strong> - The BabyTech bottle is a disposable, sterile and compact rubber baby bottle made from recyclable materials that expand under pressure from the baby's food.</li>

In addition, sterilizing and filling a baby bottle can present difficulties to parents, especially during trips and at night. Furthermore, current disposable bottles are limited, including:

Partially disposable - Sometimes, only parts of the bottles are disposable, such as just the nipples or just the liners.
Disposable with 'old' problems - Several inexpensive disposable bottles have the same inherent problems of standard bottles, such as filling is still difficult.
Limited to certain foods - There are disposable bottles that can work mainly with their own brand of foods or are pre-filled.
Mostly for trips - A recent solution collapses as the baby feeds, but, as the baby drinks, the bottle can go floppy, which cannot happen to BabyTech.
 
The BabyTech Bottle 
Totally made of recyclable rubber, the bottle is composed of a nipple, valve and an inflating tube. The bottle is inflated with the baby's food and the valve stops the liquids from bursting out. When the baby drinks the valve opens, and when the baby stops, the valve closes again, on its own.


The bottle’s benefits include:


Disposable - It allows parents to quickly return to sleep without searching for and washing bottles, which is also an extremely useful feature for trips as well as hospitals.

Portable - The volume of a few BabyTech bottles is half of a standard bottle, which is useful for trips.

Sterile - In addition to being disinfected and sterilized, the bottles are kept in hygienic packaging.

Natural nursing feeling - Its soft touch (elastic material) gives a baby a feeling of natural nursing, making the transition from breastfeeding to a bottle much easier and smoother.

Better digestion - The bottle prevents extra gases in a baby’s digestive system since no air enters it. It also allows eating while sitting (see below), which further improves digestion. As research has proven, when eating occurs while sitting the air is concentrated on the upper part of the digestive system and is thus immediately released at the end of feeding. However, when eating while lying down the air mixes with the food and causes the accumulation of gases in the digestive system, thereby requiring actions to release the gases (e.g. taps on the back for extended minutes).

Safe eating while sitting - It is the only bottle that allows sitting babies to eat without raising their heads. The food is given to the baby at a controlled rate, making it much safer.

Feeding is easy and fast - The BabyTech bottle achieves this by means of its controlled pressure and by preventing the known vacuum problem.

Has no Bisphinol A - Many have raised concerns about the impact of this material on their child.

Higher food safety - Due to the bottle's vacuum package, the food stays edible for a longer time. Tests also show that reducing the number of germs prevents disease and dental caries in gums/teeth.

No dripping - The bottle's unique valve enables to feed a controlled dosage to a baby's mouth.

Lightest bottle available - Totally made of rubber, the BabyTech bottle is the lightest on the market.

Environmental friendly - The BabyTech bottle is a disposable, sterile and compact rubber baby bottle made from recyclable materials that expand under pressure from the baby's food.

Our Vision
We began this journey with a vision that the BabyTech bottle will help babies and parents all over the world. Today, we have a patented and fully developed beta product and we need your help to complete the first generation of the BabyTech bottle.
Thank you so much for helping us make this dream come true!",5.0,0,"1 Campaign

However, you don’t have to recharge energy when you use Good Ion. Just pour water! And there is no natural discharge in Good Ion. You can use this useful product in a foreign country or location with no electricity.
 

 
 
We recommend this product if you are someone who
uses smart phone very often,
enjoys travelling,
loves extreme camping,
possess boat,
likes to go fishing,
loves climbing often,
prepares disaster and blackout or works at mine.

 
 
When you should call for this product? 
In a country and area with insufficient electricity supply
In a building or exterior space where requires electricity for emergency
In area vulnerable to the nature disaster
In area in which produces loud sound and needs fuel in order to be supplied power supply
In case of power supply in the confined space
 
While solar power and gravity are more likely to be affected by weather, Good Ion only needs salt water and is not affected easily by external environment.
 
What We Need & What You Get
We’ve already produced mass products and you are available to purchase in Korea. The reason we started Indiegogo crowd funding is to improve design and function of the product. We will present upgraded Good Ion product for people who will participate in this crowd funding project.
 
We will offer product at lower price to 140% than selling price for people who participated in this crowd funding.
If we fail to collect U$450,000.00(four hundred fifty thousand dollars), we will refund your full payment. Since it is unavailable to mass produce including a new plastic injection molding if the fund is not successfully collected, we have no choice but to refund your full payment.
 
After completing funding, we will improve design and improvement within 1 month 
2 months will be taken for mass production after improvement
we will deliver immediately after mass production within 2 weeks
 
Risks & Challenges
We truly believe that this product could help people live freely and improve their quality of life even in area without electricity through adapting improved product for outdoor purpose.
Movement problem while using product and waterproof issue caused by wrong horizontality will be settled with advice from relevant experts.
In order to solve corrosion problem caused by salt water, we will block off the access of salt water by producing device design. 
New design will be handled with outstanding expertise since it is very important issue for this product.
 

 
 
Team
Our team has been looking for alternative energy that anyone can use safely and easily through conducting research for 8 years in order to suggest new plans to deal with the most important and urgent energy issues that we, mankind has faced. While studying technology of powder metallurgy, we came to develop Air Cathode which is the core technology, by applying nano method that we possess and this led us to produce Good Ion product.",4.0,0,"1 Campaign

The RMU MTB Cargo Collection is inspired by adventure, and built for the journey.We are an inclusive mountain company. We connect people to the mountains, people to people, and people to mountain lifestyle. Our products are solutions for mountain life. We are skiers, we are mountain bikers, we are a mountain company.We...are RMU outdoors.11 years ago we started building skis in a garage...because of our passion for skiing and the outdoors. That led to us becoming a legitimate business, earning international awards, and manufacturing skis in the best factories in the world. Those skis allowed us to open concept locations in Breckenridge Colorado, and recently Whistler Blackcomb, that have become a hub in our mountain communities.5 years ago we started designing our own equipment line for mountain biking, to address the problems we faced on a daily basis. Since we started, we have been testing, refining and developing what we consider to be the ultimate kit...the MTB Cargo Collection. We have designed, developed, and tested these prototypes. We are excited to launch our new collection here on Indiegogo and we have some great perks for you to choose from. Lifetime WarrantyAt RMU, we are dedicated to supplying the best quality products with timeless design and as sustainable as possible.  We have implemented a number of programs and committed to working in an ongoing manner with every partner, and ultimately deliver this commitment to every customer. Every RMU product makes carries a lifetime warranty on manufacturers defects for the original owners of the product.  We are committed to maximizing the build quality and long term durability.How you can get involved.We have made sure to procure fabric early, switched to a Nylon liner fabric instead of Polyester and locally source all buckles and trims. We’ve got some great perks that range from a virtual high five, graphic tees, stickers...and we even have packs available RIGHT now. The Core Pack 15L, and BRFCS35-50 are in stock and available now for purchase on www.RMUoutdoors.com and in our retail locations in Breckenridge Colorado and Whistler Blackcomb. The Tailgate Locker 2.0, Enduro Fanny 5L, and Utility Belt are all available for pre-order at a discounted rate and will ship to you in March if the campaign is successful.Tailgate Locker 2.0The Tailgate Locker has weatherproof 840D Nylon with Carbonate + PU coating to hold up to the elements and four Aluminum buckles keep things secure. It’s insulated beer pocket has a food-grade liner to keep the funk out and locking zippers to keep your precious cargo safe. Available in Standard (54” x 18”) to fit small and mid-sized pickups (ie Tacoma, Frontier) and XL (61” x 20”) for full coverage on the biggest trucks (ie Tundra, F250).""The Truck pad to end all Truck pads""""This is the coolest thing I've ever bought for my truck. Every detail was thought out for throwing bikes, beers, and accessories onto the back of my truck. It's super durable, holds a bunch of bikes, and you can even throw beers into it! Additionally, I love the integration of throwing a cable lock into it to lock my bikes!""-Mike (V1 owner from Seattle) ""Simply put, this pad is leaps and bounds ahead of the other tailgate pads out there. 100% a premium option.""-David  Enduro Fanny 5LWe made the Enduro Fanny because we wanted to get the pack off our backs for those hotter days, without giving up any of the functionality. The Enduro Fanny has enough space for the essentials: tools, a reservoir or bottle, snacks, a spare jacket, etc. It uses the same waterproof fabric as all our packs, has thoughtful organization for tools and it even fits a helmet for when hiking is the only way up. Aluminum hardware, a bright interior and a stowable bottle pocket round out a bag that punches above its volume.

 
MTB Utility BeltThe Utility Belt is the sleekest way to carry your tools under your jersey. Stretch pockets keep everything you need handy and a stowable bottle pocket lets you bring extra fluids. With enough space for basic tools, your phone, wallet and keys, it’s the go-to solution for every ride. By supporting our campaign, your are becoming apart of the RMU Community, which has helped build and shape RMU into what it is today!

<h3>Save money and enjoy your commute, with PingRide! </h3>
<p>If 680 is driving you mad, try PingRide's new commuter coach service. Direct service in both directions between Hacienda Business Park in Pleasanton and Moffett Park in Sunnyvale is just $10 per roundtrip. That's less than half the cost of driving alone* and you're free to text, surf the web, work, nap, read--whatever. </p>
<p>PingRide aims to transform Bay Area transportation systems as a model for the world. We are passionate about transportation and experienced in creating and managing great services like this for some of the most successful companies in the Bay Area. By focusing on this commute, we can offer great service with free wi-fi onboard a luxury coach at a great price, with free parking at the business park near your home, and a flexible schedule, so you're sure to make it back home, whenever your day is done. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need to raise $13,500 to pay for 4 luxury coaches for the week. That means we'll need 270 people to buy a $50 pass. That's a lot of early adopters, but it's the volume we'll need to provide the flexible schedule we think you'll need. (FYI, at this level, the buses will be just over 1/2-full--or just under 1/2-empty, depending upon how you choose to look at it ;-) </p>
<p>Here are the details: </p>
<p>For $50, you get a 1-week pass for our coaches, good for one round-trip for each weekday from March 4 thru 8. You can get on whichever bus fits your schedule that day, but seats are limited and available on a first come, first-served basis. </p>
<p>For service in either direction, departures are scheduled as follows: </p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">AM: 7:15, 7:45, 8:15, 8:45, 9:15, and 10:00</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">PM: 4:00, 5:00, 5:30, 6:00, 6:30, and 7:00</p>
<p>AM Pickup (PM Dropoff) locations at both Hacienda and Moffett are TBD. Both will be  adjacent to ample free parking. </p>
<p>AM Dropoff (PM Pickup) locations throughout each business park will be determined by demand, so encourage your co-workers and neighboring companies to sign up! We will include enough stops to get anywhere in each park by a 5-minute walk, and we'll include a stop covenient to connecting shuttle or light-rail services no matter what. </p>
<p>This is a ""fixed funding"" campaign, so there's no risk: if we don't reach our goal, you don't pay. </p>
<p>If we do reach our goal, you will get to enjoy the service for a week with no further obligation. We'll follow up with campaigns to fund service for the following weeks and months, and you'll be eligible for discounts and incentives for spreading the word that could have you riding for free! </p>
<p>Don't forget to check with your employer to use federal pre-tax transit benefits to pay for your pass, or to see if they'll help directly subsidize your sustainable, green commute! </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We already know that employees at some of the biggest tech firms in the Bay Area can't live without this kind of service. Together, we can make a real difference in your budget, your quality of life, and the environment, not only throughout the Bay Area, but around the world. </p>
<p>*AAA says the total cost of driving alone is typically $0.58/mile. This round-trip is about 60 miles, for a total of $34.80/day!</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Your co-workers and neighbors want this service too: Please spread the word! </p>

What is the Bike2Charge?




Bike2Charge is an open-source bike charger that converts any AC-DC signal between 8-12 V to a clean 5V DC on a USB A jack. Plug the Bike2Charge into your dynamo, plug your phone in. And you are ready to charge your phone whilst you are cycling.











The Goal:


To produce the Bike2Charge PCB's at a reasonable price, the PCB's must be manufactured in volume. To accomplish this, we need your help. We need to sell at least 20 PCB's to keep the cost down.
features:
-Built-in over-current protection
-Can charge ANY USB device
-Iphone/Ipod charging support
-Status LED
-MAX current = 1 A (@Vin = 8V)

Case:
I've designed a custom case for the Bike2Charge PCB. It's made out of a piece of plexiglas. I lasercut the pieces and send them with your order. The pieces fit nicely together, just snap them into place. Here you see some photo's of the case:

Testing and theory of operation:

We tested the Bike2Charge with several phones: Sony Xperia U, Ipod Touch, Samsung galaxy mini, ...
Bike2Charge charging an Ipod Touch:



Below, you see a screenshot of the oscilloscope with the signal coming from the generator:


The Bridge rectifier converts the alternating AC voltage into positive spikes,
The cap smooths out this spiky DC signal.
Then the voltage regulator turns it into a steady 5V DC, needed to charge your phone.
The PTC protects the circuit from overcurrent.
The resistor at the USB A socket creates a 2V DC on the datalines, this insures your Ipod/Iphone Will charge.
And finally we have a (yellow) status LED.

Current stage:
The PCB's are in.

<p>What is the Heart of Istria project all about?</p>
<ul>
<li>It will allow you to experience a dream holiday</li>
<li>It is the first ever crowdfunded holiday home</li>

<li>The opportunity to experience Istria, Croatia - Voted best tourist destination of 2016</li>

</ul>
<p> </p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">WHY</h3>
<p>The purpose of this campaign is to bring to life and create a completely unique holiday home. We love our free time and enjoy our vacations as much we are sure you do. Since we also love Croatia, especially Istria, and have the knowhow and experience, the decision to create the Heart of Istria villa was very easy.

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">THE VILLA</h3>
<p>The Heart of Istria villa is like no other villa available in Istria today. Designed with the upmost luxury and quality in mind, whilst maintaining absolute privacy. This unique holiday home is set apart by not being part of a complex, yet retaining the extremely high standard usually only available in five star hotels and resorts. Accommodating up to ten people, it is entirely yours for the duration of your dream holiday.</p>

<p>We decided the goal of this unique project is not just a high end luxury villa in one of the most beautiful areas in the world. It is a dream holiday. By pouring our hearts and minds into this project we created the ideal setting for your vacation:</p>
<ul>
<li>It is not too large (what's the point of spending your free time with friends and family if you don't see each other?) yet big enough to accommodate your every whim.</li>
<li>Completely private, while being extremely well connected, enabling you to easily visit every part of Istria.</li>
<li>On site staff which will care for you like you're in one of the finest hotels, yet will make themselves scarce when not needed, giving you full privacy.</li>
<li>Modern and eco-friendly, using solar power. Even the swimming pool is heated so it can be used the whole year round.</li>
</ul>

After a swim in the pool the comfortable lounge is perfect for resting in the sun and enjoying a relaxing drink.</p>
<p>The outside kitchen has been designed as a social , offering a traditional barbecue to prepare meals around.</p>

</div></div>","Villa in the Heart of Istria
 

What is the Heart of Istria project all about?

It will allow you to experience a dream holiday
It is the first ever crowdfunded holiday home
Built through crowdfunding the focus will be on you, not achieving profit
We love our holidays so the villa is planned for what we know you want
It offers a 5 star hotel service in a private villa
The opportunity to experience Istria, Croatia - Voted best tourist destination of 2016
Ultimate luxury and comfort during your incredible holiday

 
WHY
The purpose of this campaign is to bring to life and create a completely unique holiday home. We love our free time and enjoy our vacations as much we are sure you do. Since we also love Croatia, especially Istria, and have the knowhow and experience, the decision to create the Heart of Istria villa was very easy. We got to design something which would promote our country and bring pleasure and luxury to all our visitors!
The holiday home is designed to provide a dream vacation for every type of tourist, something different to anything on the market already, unique in its funding and approach, and all for a very affordable price, thanks to the perks!
 
FEATURED IN

 

THE VILLA
The Heart of Istria villa is like no other villa available in Istria today. Designed with the upmost luxury and quality in mind, whilst maintaining absolute privacy. This unique holiday home is set apart by not being part of a complex, yet retaining the extremely high standard usually only available in five star hotels and resorts. Accommodating up to ten people, it is entirely yours for the duration of your dream holiday.

We decided the goal of this unique project is not just a high end luxury villa in one of the most beautiful areas in the world. It is a dream holiday. By pouring our hearts and minds into this project we created the ideal setting for your vacation:

It is not too large (what's the point of spending your free time with friends and family if you don't see each other?) yet big enough to accommodate your every whim.
Completely private, while being extremely well connected, enabling you to easily visit every part of Istria.
On site staff which will care for you like you're in one of the finest hotels, yet will make themselves scarce when not needed, giving you full privacy.
Modern and eco-friendly, using solar power. Even the swimming pool is heated so it can be used the whole year round.

 
As you step into the villa grounds and get your first glimpse of the house you will immediately sense the incredible thought and care which went into its design. The villa itself is over 220 square meters with large surrounding grounds encircled by a high stone wall - providing privacy and peace of mind.
 
 
Taking a stroll around the house through the carefully planned garden will take you from the front patio and covered parking to the back terrace with an outdoor swimming pool and relaxation area. After a swim in the pool the comfortable lounge is perfect for resting in the sun and enjoying a relaxing drink.
The outside kitchen has been designed as a social , offering a traditional barbecue to prepare meals around.
 
 
To make sure you have the experience of a five star hotel the villa has some amazing amenities:



 5 stars

 Green power

 Free parking

 Pet friendly




 AC

 Cable TV

 Free Wi-Fi

 On site staff




 Fireplace

 Gameroom

 Fitness room

 Hot tub




 Room service

 Laundry service

 En suite bathrooms

 Swimming pool

  

Inside, the ground floor is open plan to provide maximum enjoyment and mingling. The hub of activity is the grand fireplace - perfect for setting the mood and warming up on winter nights!
 
The kitchen is fully integrated into the room so anyone using it isn't secluded. The dining table and game room seamlessly continue from it. The rear wall is entirely glass with integrated glass doors, offering superb lighting and connectivity with the backyard terrace.
 
 
The first floor features bedrooms with en-suite bathrooms. Each bedroom also has its own balcony for those moments you wish to savor alone or in the company of your significant other, without the rest of the pack.
 
 
 
 
 
 
LOCATED IN - ISTRIA
Istria is a gorgeous region in the beautiful tourist country of Croatia. The special thing about Istria is it has everything you could imagine in a small area. Whatever you want your vacation to be, you can experience it in Istria!
Do you enjoy sunny weather and relaxing on the beach?

 
Or perhaps you're more into active vacations?

 
Istria is also famous throughout the world for its superb gastronomy!

 
There are plenty of sights and cultural festivals to visit.

 
Or perhaps you'd prefer to just relax and enjoy your luxurious holiday?

 
So we've decided to build a luxury holiday villa like no other and place it in the very Heart of Istria!

 
Whether the above is news to you or you already know everything about how great Istria is, it should be clear that this is a must visit location for your holidays - at least once, although many visitors decide to spend every vacation here once they've experienced it for themselves.
With mild Mediterranean climate but exceptionally diverse terrain, Istria is also a great place to visit throughout the year. A summer visit will enable you to enjoy the sea and many activities while a winter visit with snowy hills provides a perfect romantic getaway.

We've come a long way and we are now ready to bring the project to life! Help us pass this milestone and reach our goal as planned on this timeline!

 
STRETCH GOALS
We want to make this the best holiday villa ever! And that's what our goal is. But there's always room for improvement so we already have some secret ideas lined up!

Back the project and let's reach more than the goal to discover the additional features which will improve your vacation even more!
 

FAQ
If you have any questions please feel free to e-mail us: info@croatianholidayvilla.com
 
Q: I'm having trouble contributing for a desired perk!
A: Contact us info@croatianholidayvilla.com and let us know the problem.  We'll figure it out with Indiegogo.
 
Q: If I get a stay at the villa perk, when can I come and use it?
A: Check our timeline. As soon as the villa construction is complete we will contact all backers and provide access to our online booking tool. Using this you will be able to book your stay for whenever you want.
 
Q: Do I share the villa with someone else?
A: No. Unless you picked the Unknown party or Unforgettable perk, the whole villa is yours for the duration of your stay.
 
Q: Can I bring my children?
A: Of course. If they still sleep in a cot you'll be able to request this using the booking tool at no extra cost. And if you want some time for yourself our fully qualified staff will gladly babysit.
 
Q: Can I get multiple perks?
A: Yes! Due to Indiegogo process you will need to purchase one at a time but nothing is preventing you from doing so or from combining them when you use them.
 
SUCCESS
We're committed to the success of this project. That's why we opted for fixed funding - since we know exactly what needs to be done and exactly what it will cost. This means we must reach the goal to succeed and offer you the best vacation of your life.

<h3>Who We Are</h3>
<p>SKYLAB® is part of an innovative Product Development and Design firm based in the Bay Area. Our staff has over 30+ combined years of experience creating and bringing unique, sought-after consumer products to market. We recently began designing, prototyping, and manufacturing our own products, with Axis™ as our first entry to market.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1526324693/wveqmg8wnqle2xtggm2n.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
</div><div><h3>Axis™ - Highly Functional &amp; Well-Designed</h3></div><div>
<p>Our goal was to create a new unique device that eliminated the need for rolling papers while offering consistent and smooth draws. We also wanted to help reduce the number of discarded filters (that take eons to degrade) off the streets, out of landfills, and out of waterways.</p>
<p>AXIS™ is designed as a stylish and extremely functional tool, leaving no stone unturned to ensure peak performance. The movable plate gives excellent compression while preventing fallback into the cylinder, which was something we found challenging when using auger-style offerings.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1526324611/uvm8srieevvbzwgu1ca2.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Next, we looked at how to create a cover that would perform several functions:</p>
<p>- Loss-limit design</p>
<p>- Prevents rolling</p>
<p>- Impact resistance</p>
<p>- Storage &amp; dor control</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1526324737/ozzylbzyz1uslmkyakkl.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Finally, in the end, we needed to ensure that the Axis™ could be easily cleaned. Using a liquid solution-based cleaner, and a few minutes of time, and you'll have it prepped and ready to go for the next session.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Hurdles &amp; Successes </h3>
<p>There were certainly hiccups along the development path to get things just right. We value our internal folks' ability to quickly make changes and necessary updates so we were able to finalize a product that we were more than happy with. After countless prototypes and active sessions, we did it. Axis™ has come to life.</p>

</div></div>","Who We Are
SKYLAB® is part of an innovative Product Development and Design firm based in the Bay Area. Our staff has over 30+ combined years of experience creating and bringing unique, sought-after consumer products to market. We recently began designing, prototyping, and manufacturing our own products, with Axis™ as our first entry to market.

Axis™ - Highly Functional & Well-Designed
Our goal was to create a new unique device that eliminated the need for rolling papers while offering consistent and smooth draws. We also wanted to help reduce the number of discarded filters (that take eons to degrade) off the streets, out of landfills, and out of waterways.
AXIS™ is designed as a stylish and extremely functional tool, leaving no stone unturned to ensure peak performance. The movable plate gives excellent compression while preventing fallback into the cylinder, which was something we found challenging when using auger-style offerings.

Next, we looked at how to create a cover that would perform several functions:
- Loss-limit design
- Prevents rolling
- Impact resistance
- Storage & dor control

Finally, in the end, we needed to ensure that the Axis™ could be easily cleaned. Using a liquid solution-based cleaner, and a few minutes of time, and you'll have it prepped and ready to go for the next session.

Hurdles & Successes 
There were certainly hiccups along the development path to get things just right. We value our internal folks' ability to quickly make changes and necessary updates so we were able to finalize a product that we were more than happy with. After countless prototypes and active sessions, we did it. Axis™ has come to life.

I also learned a lot about street photography from Eric Kim blog and Street hunters. 

Visit my Flickr page https://www.flickr.com/photos/dusanzidar , or my web page.What Is It About
This project goal is making a beautiful b&w art photo book about life and emotion of the Greek people in this uncertain time. I will put my heart and soul plus 100% of work into this and then choose only 30 outstanding photographs out of five to ten thousand. It will take about a month to select, edit, post process, develop/scan films and design a book, after we return from the trip. So the perks will be going out shipping at the end of November. Title of the book remains unknown until the selection of the photographs.



There is a lot going on in Greece this year (financial crisis, war refugees...) which will make this project even more important and challenging for me to accomplish.








Estimated departure date is scheduled on 20.09.2015. The plan is to travel around Greek mainland and coastline for one month with our small camper (converted from a van) and subjectively capture amazing photographs. My better half and my partner Tanja and our dog Jazz are joining me on this adventurous journey to keep me company and help my creativity going.
How You Can Help
This is an unprofitable art project. The funding for the trip is coming from our pockets, so basically the money that you will be contributing will mostly go for perks (printing books, shipping costs, fees...). I hope some extra will stay for the food & drink on the road☺ 


There are five ways in which you can contribute/participate





€4 - Big THANK YOU and a pack of two postcard size photographs from the journey.


€10 - A pack of four postcard size photographs signed by the author plus E- photo book from the journey.


€20 - A pack of 8 postcard size photographs signed by the author plus E- photo book from the journey.


€35 - Signed small PHOTO BOOK 34 pages/30photographs - (limited edition) plus 2x signed postcard size prints  plus E-book.There will also be thank-you note with 20 names of contributors stated in each photo book.


€45 - Signed large PHOTO BOOK 34 pages/30photographs - (limited edition) plus 4x signed postcard size prints  plus E-book. There will also be thank-you note with 20 names of contributors stated in each photo book.


Free shipping for all perks!! (shipping costs already included in price)






What You're Getting Into
By contributing, you’re becoming a part of beautiful art project but also enabling me to accomplish a dream.
Other Ways You Can Help

I don't think everybody wants prints, e-books or a Photo book, but I would appreciate if you could share this in case some of your friends would enjoy a Art Photo book from Greece.
Please share it and tell me what you think about this project. 
Whenever we can (if I can find a wifi spot) we will be posting news about the trip and the project on GREECE Monochrome facebook page.
I belive this is going to be quite an adventure!


Thank you for taking the time to read and watch my video, and to share this campaign with your friends!!

We are confident that we will be able to ship on time if you back us with the target amount.As for international shipping, it is not possible for us to be able to ascertain the duties and tariff policy of every nation in the world. Therefore, our price does not include the VAT or duties that may be charged by each country when crossing the border. We encourage you to research your country's tax and import regulations before pledging.",33.0,1,"2 Campaigns

<p>Over half of the world’s population live in cities and at Néit we are counted amongst them. We have spent a good proportion of our lives living in small city apartments that we try to keep as uncluttered as possible. However, as you know, that’s easier said than done. </p>
<p>We consider ourselves to be global citizens who travel regularly. Upon arriving home from one particular adventure in South-East Asia, we realised how frustrating it was that our luggage took up so much of our precious and otherwise useable space in our apartments. The more we thought about it, the more we started to recognise that it wasn’t just luggage that hasn’t
been adapted to modern day city-living.The Neit concept was born! </p>

<p>We quickly migrated this experience to focus on the luggage problem. Luggage
 has seen little radical development in many years. We travel more regularly than ever before, yet our luggage and travel experience has remained largely unchanged. So, we set out to design a
hard-shelled case that would complement our modern urban lifestyles from the moment we pull the case out of our closet all the way to putting it back in at the end of the trip; a head-turning companion while on the road and at our destination. Néit Luggage will add value to all aspects of your travel experience, before, during and after; your modern-day travel companion!<img class=""lazy"" data-pin-nopin=""true"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/v1458066765/choc0n4objno3pjmlcsk.png"" src="""" style=""background-color: initial;""/><span style=""background-color: initial;""> </span></p>

<p>We’ve finalised our prototype and are ready to take our luggage to the next level. We’re working with D2M, a Uk based design and manufacturing consultancy with previous experience in collapsible products, to make sure the process runs as smoothly as possible. We have a manufacturer lined up with 5 alternatives, should we encounter any problems. We have source manufacturers for all additional products and have a global distribution company lined up to assist with the logistics, as well as contingencies should we encounter any issues. 

With your help we can bring this project to life and give you the world's first smart, collapsible and hangable hardcase luggage. </p>

</div>","Néit is a revolutionary premium quality suitcase available in carry-on and check-in sizes. Néit's most amazing feature is its collapsibility, which reduces the case to just 3 inches, making it easy to store when not in use.  





















Collapses down in under 10 seconds


Storing luggage takes up loads of space when you're not using it, especially when space is already tight. Néit’s unique (Patent Pending) collapsing mechanism saves you space and allows the case to reduce to ~30% of its original volume. Collapsing the case is simple, takes less than 10 seconds and can only be achieved when the case is unlocked and opened. Welcome to more efficient storage. Your space back for something more important. 













Just 3 inches needed for storage


Néit luggage collapses down to just 3 inches when not in use, which means it can be stored pretty much anywhere.
Don't have free space under your bed or couch? Why not hang it...
Our carabiner-style handle enables you to hang-store your luggage when not in use. No more rummaging around for your case when you can pull it straight of out of your closet. The carabiner-style handle also makes it easy to clip additional luggage/bags onto the case while you’re on the move.



Easily hangable












What more can we say? Hard Case luggage offers by far superior protection. The case is made from lightweight, yet durable Polycarbonate and features aircraft grade aluminium frame for additional structural protection and our collapsing mechanism. The perfect combination to protect your belongings while on the road...no more broken fragrance bottles in your luggage. 





Néit's distinctive design was inspired through nature. We loosely based our design pattern on an armadillo's shell; one of nature's strongest natural armours. This has created an alluring design, unparalleled in the luggage industry today. 








We use waterproof YKK Aquaseal zips


YKK zippers are known around the world for their superior quality. All zippers (both internal & external) on Néit luggage are YKK's waterproof Aquaseal which are consistently used in top quality mountaineering equipment.









Let’s face it, 4 wheels beats 2. Take the strain out of walking with your luggage with our 4 revolving spinner wheels. When storing your case your wheels can be removed and/or placed into the base. This allows for a more efficient use of space - Packing multiple cases in your car becomes easier, as does storing your carry-on in an overhead locker. 










Why put GPS in your luggage? More than 1.5 Million bags were lost or stolen in the US alone in the past year. And let's face it, no-one likes to lose their luggage. Our GPS enabled product allows you to quickly locate your luggage anywhere in the world through our integrated travel app








Home screen and Find my bag feature





My trips and flight booking feature


Our unique IOS/Andriod app makes your travelling life easier. We provide you with all your essential travel information in one place. Through the Néit travel app you can locate your case with our GPS tracker, store your boarding pass, book additional flights and hotels, check the status of your flight, map your route from airport to hotel and find out location specific tips on things-to-do at your destination.















Over half of the world’s population live in cities and at Néit we are counted amongst them. We have spent a good proportion of our lives living in small city apartments that we try to keep as uncluttered as possible. However, as you know, that’s easier said than done. 
We consider ourselves to be global citizens who travel regularly. Upon arriving home from one particular adventure in South-East Asia, we realised how frustrating it was that our luggage took up so much of our precious and otherwise useable space in our apartments. The more we thought about it, the more we started to recognise that it wasn’t just luggage that hasn’t
been adapted to modern day city-living.The Neit concept was born! 



Initial design sketch


Initially, we started small, with our slim and stylish iPhone CardCase. The Neit phone case reduces pocket bulk, protects your phone and enables you carry up to 2 important cards (e.g. contactless payment). The Neit phone case provided us with our early experience of sourcing, manufacturing, and logistics.

We are thrilled to reveal Erle-Spider as the first legged drone powered by Snappy Ubuntu Core. A smart robot running  Linux and based totally on the Robot Operating System (ROS). This computer with legs is the result of our work over the last years and we are really excited to see what you can do with it.
Yes! A cloud-based marketplace for robots and drones available for you to start creating the next game changer app for robots. Developing apps is free, no silly developer licenses, just a simple account. Do you feel like you want to learn more? Check out our store intro here.
































Erle-Spider includes the latest version of our artificial brains (not released yet) for robots and drones: Erle-Brain 2.



900MHz quad-core ARM Cortex-A7, 1 GB RAM

USB, Ethernet, I2C, UART, HDMI and more.
Gravity sensor, gyroscope, digital compass, pressure sensor and temperature sensor.

Snappy Ubuntu Core
ROS Indigo

Erle-Brain 2 will have support for ROS, APM and several other frameworks for robot and drone applications development.




Our kits come with comprehensive instructions and a step-by-step walkthrough on how to create your first drone app for Erle-Spider. You don't need to have a PhD in robotics or a masters in mechanical engineering to build this robot. We've made it really simple so that the only requirements are some patience and some love for robotics.


















What are the mechanical dimensions of Erle-Spider? And the weight? 
Dimensions: 34x24x15 cm. Weight: 2.1 kg.
Can I use the assembled Spider straight out of the box? 
Yes, the assembled version is thought to be used out of the box.

Can you guarantee Xmas delivery for the December orders?
Yes we can! Our team has been working really hard to get everything ready in time for this December.

Which ROS distro will Erle-Spider include?
Indigo.
What is the controller? Can I use my phone?
We've put together a simple wireless controller gamepad for you to interact easily with Erle-Spider. If the Android app stretch goal is reached we'll release an Android smartphone app to do the same.
What skills do I need to complete a DIY kit?
Some interest in robotics and a bit of patience. 


I don't know how to program, how can I create behaviors with Erle-Spider?

We've done a lot of thinking about this matter and decided to provide support for Scratch if the corresponding stretch goal is met. With it, everyone will be able to create programs for our robot with simple blocks without laying a single line of code. Furthermore this will help shaping your mind to later learn about other ways of programming robots.


Why are you crowdfunding?
In order to make Erle-Spider affordable we need to produce big quantities.
Are you going to open Erle-Spider designs?
Yes we are, sources, components and designs will be opened under a GPLv3 license (unless specified or enforced by others).
Are you planning to move to ROS 2?
Yes we are. There'll be ROS 2 packages for those that dare to try it out. Once ROS 2 becomes stable, our official releases will be based on ROS 2.
I want to create a robot app, will you help me with that?
Unfortunately we won't be able to help every single individual with their applications however our forum (http://forum.erlerobotics.com) will be open to questions and our engineers generally answer as many as they can.
I want to make money with my robot application, can I charge for it?
Definitely! Robot apps start at 3$ but compared to smartphone apps, we wouldn't be surprised is behaviors above 50-100 $ appear soon.
Can Erle-Spider run computer vision algorithms onboard?
Absolutely! 4 ARM cores running at 900 MHz have room for a lot. Help us spread the word about Erle-Spider and you might get your Spider with a camera included ($150K stretch goal).
Can i put a custom Linux kernel or another file system?
Yes you can but note that we will only offer support for our Snappy images.
Spiders have 8 legs, why yours has 6?
Because ours can do more with less :)

In the video you showed Erle-Brain but the campaign offers Erle-Brain 2. Why is this?
We have decided to offer our latest brain to deliver an even greater experience. The new brain includes an upgrade on processing power, size (it's smaller) and sensing. What's better, since we'll be delivering big quantities, we've made it super affordable.
What is your refund policy?
During the campaign, you may get a refund for your perk via Indiegogo. Please contact support@indiegogo.com directly.
What has your team done in the field of robotics or drones?
We are part of Erle Robotics, a startup based in Spain creating artificial brains for robots and drones with ROS at its core. Over the last year or so, our team has a been selected twice as one of the most promising robotics startups worldwide, ranked in the top 8 of European tech startups and created the first flying robot powered by Snappy Ubuntu Core.

<div style=""font-family: 'Roboto', sans-serif;margin:30px;color: #4a4a49;padding-top:15px;padding-bottom:15px;""><p>When developing the Monowalker Fatmate hiking trailer, we had one goal in mind - to be self-sufficient, far away from civilization, with equipment and food for days on foot, and to get along comfortably despite the heavy weight of the equipment and difficult terrain. The Monowalker Fatmate is not only made to hike in alpine terrain, but as well suitable for expeditions in the tundra, desert, or the Scandinavian Fjell without paths. But here it shows its real strengths. With the Fatmate, it does not matter if there is a path, if snowfields obstruct the way or the ground is muddy. With the 4 ""(10 cm) wide Fattire tires (20”) you can move reliably over any terrain. The width of the tire prevents the trailer from sinking, even with heavy luggage and loose ground.</p></div></section><section style=""margin-top:15px;margin-bottom:15px;background:#fff;padding-top:25px;padding-bottom:25px;""><div style=""font-family: 'Roboto', sans-serif;margin:25px;color: #4a4a49;""><h2>Technology that reduces your gear weight</h2></div>
<div style=""font-family: 'Roboto', sans-serif;margin:30px;color: #4a4a49;padding-top:15px;padding-bottom:15px;""><p>Thanks to the special geometry of the Monowalker Fatmate, you will carry only half of your gear weight on your hips without sacrificing comfort or supply. The other half of the gear weight is on the rear wheel. With this advantage, any hike becomes a pleasure. By using the Fatmate rack, you can reduce the gear weight on your body by 70%.</p></div>

One-sided loads on the shoulder, neck or back muscles, such as those that can occur while wearing a very heavy backpack, are eliminated, even when carrying 40kg (88lbs) of gear or more with the Monowalker Fatmate. Thanks to the free-swinging suspension of the trailer on the Monowalker hip belt, the fully loaded MONOWALKER Fatmate will not affect your movement.</p></div>

A fourth loop is made for pulling a two-wheel cart or a pulk. The new Monowalker harness has a fail proof magnetic fit to secure and release hikers from the trailer intuitively. It can only be opened in one direction by pulling on the flaps in an upward opposing direction, and in case of emergency the Fidlock buckle can be opened by pulling the emergency latch and will release the trailer within one second, even under a heavy load. A third buckle at the hipbelt frontside has as well panic release features. All can be opened within a second as well with tensile load in case of an emergency. Adjustable in the length, the shoulderbelts will fit any person. Those are attached with a magnetic-mechanical closure at the hipbelt and can be attached and detached within a second from the hipbelt.

The special features of these new ball-bearings: A polymer material is molded into the free space of the bearing, forming a narrow gap around the rolling elements and raceways, enabling the bearing to rotate freely. The polymer matrix has a porous structure, with millions of micro-pores, that hold the lubricating oil retained by surface tension. In operation, oil is released from the material into the narrow gaps between it and the bearing components, thus providing effective minimum quantity lubrication. Bearings filled with Oil are lubricated for the life of the bearing and contain two to four times more oil than bearings using a conventional grease fill. Solid Oil cannot be washed out and virtually fills all the free space, thus limiting the amount of dirt and contamination that can enter the bearing. The polymer filling physically supports integral seals, reinforcing their effectiveness under wash-down conditions</p></div>

My company is run out of a small town located in the south of Germany, near Freiburg, right at the bottom of the mountains of the Black Forest. I feel fortunate to be able to call this place my home because the outdoors are my backyard, and I love to take advantage of it whenever I can. As mechanic and former product manager in the bike industry I` m passionate about anything that has two wheels that can carry me and my stuff. Working several years as Product Manager in the bicycle industry, I have the skills to realize larger productions. In the past years, I assembled the Monowalker Fatmate from my workshop in the old trainstation, named “Kingdom of Heaven”.</p></div>

To take just one comparison, if your mode of escape is a mountain bike, you might pay 1000 – 2000 – 5000 USD. A quality rucksack might set you back 150-450 USD. A Kayak will give you freedom and relief on water, but for 1500 USD or more. Here’s the medicine: by the laws of physics all the dynamic stresses of a rucksack load, in addition to your own body mass, go through your shoulders, neck, back, hips, knees, etc.For me as creator of the Monowalker Fatmate, those stresses result in intolerable, preclusive pain in my shoulders and neck. In this context, and taking into account the sheer quality of this all-terrain-marvel, the 1199,00 Euro price tag (incl. German sales tax for customers from the EU) respective 1007,00 €(price ex EU, e.g. USA, Canada or Switzerland) price tag of the Monowalker might seem really very reasonable. What are your knees and shoulders worth and experiences in the great outdoors ? Consider it is an investment in your future freedom … or, as the price to pay for a new lease of LIFE!”<br/> </p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></section><section style=""margin-top:15px;margin-bottom:15px;background:#fff;padding-top:25px;padding-bottom:25px;""><div style=""font-family: 'Roboto', sans-serif;margin:25px;color: #4a4a49;""><h2>Join our community</h2></div>

</div></div>","Monowalker Fatmate – the hiking cart that carries your outdoor gear!
Performance that rocks
When developing the Monowalker Fatmate hiking trailer, we had one goal in mind - to be self-sufficient, far away from civilization, with equipment and food for days on foot, and to get along comfortably despite the heavy weight of the equipment and difficult terrain. The Monowalker Fatmate is not only made to hike in alpine terrain, but as well suitable for expeditions in the tundra, desert, or the Scandinavian Fjell without paths. But here it shows its real strengths. With the Fatmate, it does not matter if there is a path, if snowfields obstruct the way or the ground is muddy. With the 4 ""(10 cm) wide Fattire tires (20”) you can move reliably over any terrain. The width of the tire prevents the trailer from sinking, even with heavy luggage and loose ground.Technology that reduces your gear weight
Thanks to the special geometry of the Monowalker Fatmate, you will carry only half of your gear weight on your hips without sacrificing comfort or supply. The other half of the gear weight is on the rear wheel. With this advantage, any hike becomes a pleasure. By using the Fatmate rack, you can reduce the gear weight on your body by 70%.

Monowalker Fatmate without rack.

Downhill and uphill hikes with the Monowalker cause less stress on your knees because you only carry half of your gear's weight; 45 kg (100lbs) equipment load is the comfort area for trained hikers. One-sided loads on the shoulder, neck or back muscles, such as those that can occur while wearing a very heavy backpack, are eliminated, even when carrying 40kg (88lbs) of gear or more with the Monowalker Fatmate. Thanks to the free-swinging suspension of the trailer on the Monowalker hip belt, the fully loaded MONOWALKER Fatmate will not affect your movement.
The Monowalker Fatmate is made for your hiking adventure!
For years now, the Monowalker has been used by our customers around the world - all of them on very different and often long outdoor adventures like Sandor Lau , https://www.sandorsoregontrail.com/ walking the Oregon Trail in the footsteps of the pioneers and the native people who came long before. In the documentation of “Sándor’s Oregon Trail” writer and filmmaker Sándor Lau walks from Missouri to Oregon in the footsteps of the pioneers and the moccasins of native people.

Prepper, product tester and trailblazer Canadian Prepper is one of the persons, I have to say thank you for awesome reviews on youtube. He was pushing the Monowalker Fatmate from the beginning. https://www.canadianpreparedness.com/

An early tester in the field was Mark Wood . Mark is an established polar explorer and adventurer who operates within the extremes of our planet. Accompanied by our Monowalker Fatmate, he has crossed Iceland from north to south in 20 days, carrying all his food and gear, a total of 110 pounds. http://markwoodexplorer.com/

Lucy Barnard, Australian in pursuit of becoming the first woman to walk the length of the Earth (the two american continents). https://tanglesandtail.com/ It bugged her that in the 35 years since it was first completed, no women had achieved the same feat… so she began to plan. Officially, three men have walked from Argentina to Alaska, and approximately 10 have walked variations but…only one (the first) has walked from the polar most extreme cities Three years on, she has walked the length of Argentina, Chile, Peru and Ecuador. Some say it’s an impossible dream – but she did it up to Ecuador, when the Corona crisis stopped her. The way she see it is that if he can, she can too. By using the Monowalker Fatmate, she was able to cross Chile and the Atacama Desert unsupported.

I am happy to see that long distance hiker Angela Maxwell, who crossed Australia,Vietnam,Mongolia, Georgia and Turkey with a two wheel bicycle trailer, converted to a hiking trailer switched to a Monowalker. Her travelblog is: http://www.shewalkstheearth.com/ Find out about her passion to walk and her motivation to carry all of her gear in a cart.

50,000 kilometers hitchhiking, across the oceans by ship and later on with a fresh born child in Mexico. ""Weit. The story of a way around the world"" is a colorful and particularly authentic movie about the extraordinary journey of a young couple who set off for the East, only to return home from the West three and a half years later in a threesome. Without flying and with a small budget in their pockets, they explore the world, always accompanied by curiosity and spontaneity. Coming back to Europe (Spain) they hiked back with the help of a Monowalker Fatmate, back to Germany.
The Monowalker is made for...



Hikers -who appreciate adventures in nature and don’t want to hike with heavy weight on their shoulders

Photographers & Documentary Filmmakers -who want to carry heavy gear and outdoor equipment



Hunters -who need to pull animals out of the woods

Bushwalkers -who want to do long distance walks, carrying water and food for many days without access to civilization for periods of time



Parents -who want to camp with their children but have too much to carry for 2-4 people.

Youth group leaders -who need to carry personal items plus group equipment



Disaster Control personnel -who need to carry heavy equipment on trails where vehicles are of no practical use

Worldtravelers -who like to carry gear for a year with more comfort

What is new
The new Monowalker is made of high strength aluminum tubes, drawn by a German tube maker. The newly designed handlebar unit is seamlessly adjustable in its height and width to fit various hip sizes and body heights. In just a few simple steps, you can transform the Monowalker to fit your body height and type.
Monowalker Harness
The Monowalker harness is made for pulling the Monowalker Fatmate hiking trailer and is available in two sizes.( Size S up to 88 cm (35”) / Size M up to 105 cm (41”) – size L starting at 105 cm (41”) ) You will find at the hipbelt three loops to fix the carabiner at a position that fits with your hip size. A fourth loop is made for pulling a two-wheel cart or a pulk. The new Monowalker harness has a fail proof magnetic fit to secure and release hikers from the trailer intuitively. It can only be opened in one direction by pulling on the flaps in an upward opposing direction, and in case of emergency the Fidlock buckle can be opened by pulling the emergency latch and will release the trailer within one second, even under a heavy load. A third buckle at the hipbelt frontside has as well panic release features. All can be opened within a second as well with tensile load in case of an emergency. Adjustable in the length, the shoulderbelts will fit any person. Those are attached with a magnetic-mechanical closure at the hipbelt and can be attached and detached within a second from the hipbelt. With help of the harness you may convert the hiking trailer as well to a packframe.
Packframe
Whether you have to fly to your destination or go to places not easily accessible by foot, the light-weight aluminum frame transforms in combination with the harness into a backpack frame and the wheel and handlebar unit will fit inside the duffle bag that can be ordered along with the Fatmate.
The rack
Are you planning on carrying extra heavy or bulky gear like water, food, camera equipment, bulky tents or even dog food for your furry friends? We have designed a Monowalker rack for this exact scenario. The Monowalker Fattire rack is an add-on rack with a payload of 30 kg or 66lb, designed for larger duffles with more volume than a bicycle sadlebag. Though it will fit regular bicycle saddlebags as well. The gear that is positioned on the rack, will be carried by 100% on top of the wheel axle and as a result it will reduce the weight on your hip belt by 70%.
The wheel
The 20” wheel will be build-up with the very light Alex Blizzerk 90 fattire rim and a hub with sealed SKF MTRX bearings. The MTRX bearings: the new standard in bearing technology

The Monowalker will run on the best available ball-bearing technology. The special features of these new ball-bearings: A polymer material is molded into the free space of the bearing, forming a narrow gap around the rolling elements and raceways, enabling the bearing to rotate freely. The polymer matrix has a porous structure, with millions of micro-pores, that hold the lubricating oil retained by surface tension. In operation, oil is released from the material into the narrow gaps between it and the bearing components, thus providing effective minimum quantity lubrication. Bearings filled with Oil are lubricated for the life of the bearing and contain two to four times more oil than bearings using a conventional grease fill. Solid Oil cannot be washed out and virtually fills all the free space, thus limiting the amount of dirt and contamination that can enter the bearing. The polymer filling physically supports integral seals, reinforcing their effectiveness under wash-down conditions

No lubricant washout
Solid Oil remains in the bearing


Lower risk of corrosion
Solid Oil protects the bearing components


Increased lubricant reservoir
The polymer matrix contains two to four times more oil than conventional grease fill


Longer lubricant life
MTRX bearings are lubricated for life


Protection against ingress of contaminants
Efficient seals prevent dirt from entering the bearing


Low environmental impact
With MTRX there is no lubricant leakage

Proudly engineered and manufactured in Germany
As hiker and adventurer with a love for the outdoors, I spend countless days, weeks and even months traversing different landscapes and countries. My company is run out of a small town located in the south of Germany, near Freiburg, right at the bottom of the mountains of the Black Forest. I feel fortunate to be able to call this place my home because the outdoors are my backyard, and I love to take advantage of it whenever I can. As mechanic and former product manager in the bike industry I` m passionate about anything that has two wheels that can carry me and my stuff. Working several years as Product Manager in the bicycle industry, I have the skills to realize larger productions. In the past years, I assembled the Monowalker Fatmate from my workshop in the old trainstation, named “Kingdom of Heaven”.

The price…
… hmm … a spoonful of sugar first: people have many modes of escape to their personal freedom, and all sorts of kit to facilitate adventure and exploration- none of it is cheap. To take just one comparison, if your mode of escape is a mountain bike, you might pay 1000 – 2000 – 5000 USD. A quality rucksack might set you back 150-450 USD. A Kayak will give you freedom and relief on water, but for 1500 USD or more. Here’s the medicine: by the laws of physics all the dynamic stresses of a rucksack load, in addition to your own body mass, go through your shoulders, neck, back, hips, knees, etc.For me as creator of the Monowalker Fatmate, those stresses result in intolerable, preclusive pain in my shoulders and neck. In this context, and taking into account the sheer quality of this all-terrain-marvel, the 1199,00 Euro price tag (incl. German sales tax for customers from the EU) respective 1007,00 €(price ex EU, e.g. USA, Canada or Switzerland) price tag of the Monowalker might seem really very reasonable. What are your knees and shoulders worth and experiences in the great outdoors ? Consider it is an investment in your future freedom … or, as the price to pay for a new lease of LIFE!” Join our community

They are tough to prevent and happen before, during or after a ride. For years traditional tire levers, with just a simple tire scoop, have been used to remove tires and help fix flats. They have remained nearly unchanged for decades. However tire and wheel technology has been changing and evolving. With the invention of tubeless  wheels, and the added benefit and ease of tire sealant to fix and prevent flats, traditional tire levers cannot fully service modern tubeless setups. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1532494032/x1spbyciitwx8cr3fbsg.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>With tubeless systems, the quickest way to fix and prevent a flat is to install tire sealant. The easiest way to do that is through the valve stem, but valve cores need to be removed in order to do so.</p>
<p>Using a traditional tire lever, there is no way to remove a valve core. Trust me, I know, I've spent plenty of time trying unsuccessfully. I find myself searching for my small missing valve core removal tool, needle nose pliers, or anything that would allow me to remove the valve core. That's when it dawned on me. Why not just have this remover as part of the tire lever? That way the tool is always there when a tire needs to be serviced. Whether installing new tires, removing old ones, or fixing a flat with either sealant or a tube, the tools are there.<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1532494128/ka1zotctnktsix0rtkeh.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>You will also notice other differences in my lever both aesthetically and structurally. I wanted a lever that looked good, and was tough enough to handle the repeated abuse of tire maintenance and was built to last rather than something that was disposable.</p>
<p>I wanted to it to be slick and neat... something Snēk. (fyi, it's pronounced sneak)<br/> </p>

</div></div>","One of the most common and reoccurring maintenance issues cyclists face with bicycles is a flat tire. They are tough to prevent and happen before, during or after a ride. For years traditional tire levers, with just a simple tire scoop, have been used to remove tires and help fix flats. They have remained nearly unchanged for decades. However tire and wheel technology has been changing and evolving. With the invention of tubeless  wheels, and the added benefit and ease of tire sealant to fix and prevent flats, traditional tire levers cannot fully service modern tubeless setups. 

With tubeless systems, the quickest way to fix and prevent a flat is to install tire sealant. The easiest way to do that is through the valve stem, but valve cores need to be removed in order to do so.
Using a traditional tire lever, there is no way to remove a valve core. Trust me, I know, I've spent plenty of time trying unsuccessfully. I find myself searching for my small missing valve core removal tool, needle nose pliers, or anything that would allow me to remove the valve core. That's when it dawned on me. Why not just have this remover as part of the tire lever? That way the tool is always there when a tire needs to be serviced. Whether installing new tires, removing old ones, or fixing a flat with either sealant or a tube, the tools are there.
You will also notice other differences in my lever both aesthetically and structurally. I wanted a lever that looked good, and was tough enough to handle the repeated abuse of tire maintenance and was built to last rather than something that was disposable.
I wanted to it to be slick and neat... something Snēk. (fyi, it's pronounced sneak) 



MADE IN USA. PATENT PENDING.

The Lifeboat tire lever is an all in one, tire lever, valve core remover and bottle opener. Now you fix a flat, change a tire or install sealant to tubeless wheel systems all while enjoying your beverage of choice.

COMPOSED OF A PLASTIC OUTER AND REINFORCED WITH A METAL INTERIOR, ENSURES FOR A LONG LASTING LEVER THAT WON'T DAMAGE YOUR RIM

Tubeless tires and rims are now common place in cycling and a valve core remover is needed when installing or fixing a tire.


VALVE CORES CAN EASILY BE REMOVED TO ADD SEALANT TO TUBELESS SYSTEMS

INCLUDES A BOTTLE OPENER FOR THE POST RIDE BEVERAGE

The Lifeboat Tire Lever consists of a stainless steel metal core and injection molded plastic outer. The metal strengthens the lever while the plastic keeps your rim safe from damage.

Metal runs the length of the lever, most importantly, to the tip of the scoop, adding strength where many levers fail and break.
Guaranteed for life, the lever is designed to be unbreakable. If you ever do experience a problem, we will make it right and happily replace it. 
LOW PROFILE DESIGN
The lever has a sleek, no bulk, flat profile that allows it to be easily stored in our Snēk Wallets, or tucked inside a saddle bag without taking up much room or snagging on anything.

VALVE CORE REMOVER LOCATIONS
Including two valve hole locations at opposite ends, the lever has them oriented at 90 degrees of each other, for when wheel spokes hinder full rotation.



EASY TIRE REMOVAL
Radiused edges on lever scoop allow for easier entry and tire removal on tubeless tires.


STACKABLE
Designed to stack and lock into place, this system makes it easy to keep your levers together. Whether on the go or in the shop, your levers will stay securely nested. 

SAFEGUARD BOTTLE OPENER
The bottle opener is designed with one purpose in mind; open a lifetime of cold beverages without fail. Slightly exposed metal withstands bottle caps sharp edges while the plastic outer keeps your hands and other elements comfortable.

You can stay calm when disaster strikes and explore with the confidence that you're prepared for anything.         Included in the KEA KIT is over 30 items of  just the most essential, quality survival gear curated by outdoor adventure experts. The gear you carry with you on your adventures can make all the difference in dire situations. You need gear that you can trust to get the job done and not fail on you at the first use.   The KEA KIT can be customised and adapted to any type of adventure. The modular design allows you to simply put the whole kit into your pack, or just remove the internal cases to use on their own for those shorter trips. Each case fitted with an external loop so it can easily be clipped onto any pack and internal organisation compartments help to easily pack your gear to suit any adventure.  The KEA KIT was designed for both safety and convenience so we made it compact & lightweight. It fits easily into any outdoor backpack or hiking pack, helping you to easily prepare with all your essential survival gear in one easy access case. The compact design size also means it's also great for storing as a backup survival kit in your Car, RV, Home, Boat.    The KEA KIT is built tough to suit the rugged demands of the wild. Each case is built from high quality, durable and water-resistant materials. With each featuring strong, long-lasting water-resistant zippers.   Being prepared for the outdoors is an essential part of planning any adventure. From packing the right gear, to knowing how to use it. Taking your safety seriously can literally mean the difference between life and death.      We hear you.... Survival kits out there today are poorly designed and mostly full of cheap, flimsy gear that you'll never use, not to mention trust with your life. Leaving you vulnerable and with a false sense of security. That's why we created the KEA KIT, because at beREDI Outdoors we believe that preparation is the absolute key to survival and you should never compromise on safety or quality, when your life is at stake.                    For this campaign we will only be shipping to USA, Canada, New Zealand & Australia. This is to make sure we can easily deliver to our backers. But we plan to offer the KEA KIT worldwide later in the year!To ensure we get you the best rate possible, we have decided to charge shipping after the campaign has ended and closer to the time of delivery.

<p>We are in business since 1959, we are the third generation. Everything started with our grandfather Francesco, woodworker, who decided 65 years ago to open a tool shop in our city. Then since the '70 our father started to sell industrial equipments and air systems.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1626960601/fxwbi7pn04omo835zhne.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>We decided, after college, to remain in our family business. So we started several projects, mainly in IOT and linked machinery.</p>
<p>Then, thanks to our market experience and due to our great passion for <strong>Bikes, Motorbikes and Boats</strong> we had the idea to start this new business. All the products we used for maintenance and cleaning was lacking of something: so we decided to make them our own!</p>
<p>This project started in January, and now we finally have the first test products and we started the first production in our facility in Italy!</p>

WHO WE ARE
We are in business since 1959, we are the third generation. Everything started with our grandfather Francesco, woodworker, who decided 65 years ago to open a tool shop in our city. Then since the '70 our father started to sell industrial equipments and air systems.

We decided, after college, to remain in our family business. So we started several projects, mainly in IOT and linked machinery.
Then, thanks to our market experience and due to our great passion for Bikes, Motorbikes and Boats we had the idea to start this new business. All the products we used for maintenance and cleaning was lacking of something: so we decided to make them our own!
This project started in January, and now we finally have the first test products and we started the first production in our facility in Italy!

<li>Keep the solar panel near the top of your backpack facing up toward the sun.</li>
<li>Keep your phone and battery out of direct sun and in the shade or in a bag. Excessive heat can damage batteries.</li>
<li>Best times to solar charge is from 8am to 4pm in the summer and 10am to 2pm in the winter. Even when it seems bright, atmosphere absorbs considerable sunlight when the sun is at low angles in the sky.</li>
<li>Under low power conditions like thick clouds, sunrise, or sunset, try turning on airplane mode to avoid a flashing charge screen and draining your phone battery. </li>
<li>If using Solarpad Pro with a battery bank, allow it to charge about 10 to 15 minutes before charging your phone. </li>
<li>Avoid charging behind a window because glass absorbs some light radiation and lowers solar power output.</li>
<li> Phones don't like power fluctuations in non-ideal conditions, so when in doubt, use Solarpad Pro with a battery bank for best results. </li>
<li>Try using apps like this that can show where to place Solarpad Pro in order to avoid obstructions throughout the day like trees, hills, buildings, or anything that can cast long shadows: <a href=""http://www.sunsurveyor.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.sunsurveyor.com</a>

<li>Make sure your battery bank and/or phone are fully charged before any long trip.</li>
<li>Take advantage of times when you can rest and solar charge at maximum power like lunch in a clearing or at a picnic table. Solar charging is more difficult while on the move because of shadows and non-optimal angles of the solar panel.</li>

Other equipment costs include molds for the plastic parts and creating custom assembly fixtures. Solarpad Pro is designed to be as simple to manufacture as possible and it is always being refined for the most efficient assembly. Our suppliers have given us great quality prototype parts and they are ready to manufacture the components in larger quantities.

No short-cuts that compromise power or efficiency are taken, which ultra-light backers and thru-hikers demand.Compatible with Most USB Devices - Charge your phones, cameras, music players, Bluetooth speakers, GPS devices, and more! If it's about the size of a Smart Phone, Solarpad Pro can charge it. Connect the charge cable that came with your smart phone, or other USB device, and plug it in to Solarpad Pro.Unparalleled performance - In full sun, Solarpad Pro will recharge a dead phone from 0% to 100% in 3 to 4 hours! Other similar sized solar chargers can only charge a Smart Phone from 0% to 70% and take over 4 hours to recharge.Emergency back up power - Your Solarpad Pro system will provide you with USB power when the power grid goes down after an earthquake, storm, or other natural disaster. When the grid goes down, don’t be left without power!
Keeps your phone charged to stay in touch with loved ones, get the latest news, and receive alerts and essential information. 
 Keeps the lights on by charging your USB lighting devices such as LED flashlights, headlamps, and lanterns.
If the grid is down for days or weeks, the sun will keep charging your devices. 
For your everyday use – Charging your smart phone daily with the power of the sun is not a problem with Solarpad Pro. Experience renewable off-grid power everyday with this fully DC solar power system. Charge a battery during the day and charge your phone overnight so you are ready for the next day!Entry-level solar solution – Solarpad Pro is a low cost, entry-level solar system for those wanting the independence of solar, without the high costs and space requirements of larger panels, inverters and battery banks.Tips and Tricks:
Keep the solar panel near the top of your backpack facing up toward the sun.
Keep your phone and battery out of direct sun and in the shade or in a bag. Excessive heat can damage batteries.
Best times to solar charge is from 8am to 4pm in the summer and 10am to 2pm in the winter. Even when it seems bright, atmosphere absorbs considerable sunlight when the sun is at low angles in the sky.
Under low power conditions like thick clouds, sunrise, or sunset, try turning on airplane mode to avoid a flashing charge screen and draining your phone battery. 
If using Solarpad Pro with a battery bank, allow it to charge about 10 to 15 minutes before charging your phone. 
Avoid charging behind a window because glass absorbs some light radiation and lowers solar power output.
 Phones don't like power fluctuations in non-ideal conditions, so when in doubt, use Solarpad Pro with a battery bank for best results. 
Try using apps like this that can show where to place Solarpad Pro in order to avoid obstructions throughout the day like trees, hills, buildings, or anything that can cast long shadows: http://www.sunsurveyor.com

Make sure your battery bank and/or phone are fully charged before any long trip.
Take advantage of times when you can rest and solar charge at maximum power like lunch in a clearing or at a picnic table. Solar charging is more difficult while on the move because of shadows and non-optimal angles of the solar panel.

Solarpad Pro Prototype Charging Phones Where Do the Funds Go and How Long Will it Take to Finish?We've solved the fundamental problems with solar USB charging, but right now only a few Solarpad Pro prototypes exist. In order to build the final production version at a reasonable cost, funds must be raised to purchase a minimum order of hundreds of solar cells, circuits, and plastic components. Other equipment costs include molds for the plastic parts and creating custom assembly fixtures. Solarpad Pro is designed to be as simple to manufacture as possible and it is always being refined for the most efficient assembly. Our suppliers have given us great quality prototype parts and they are ready to manufacture the components in larger quantities. Typical manufacturing lead-times are about 30 days so realistically it should take at least a few months to manufacture, assemble, final test, package, and then ship them.Other UsesThe original Solarpad was a bit more bulky and fragile, but had a lot of creative uses. Kitty who I met from the Intel booth at Mini Maker Faire in 2017 was interested in using Solarpad for a fashion project and came up with this prototype. Tent lighting using Ellumiglow Laserwire was another use. Risks & ChallengesI have a M.S. in Mechanical Engineering with over 15 years of experience and many successful projects under my belt. I also gained a lot manufacturing experience working at my Dad's sheet metal shop since I was a kid. Unforeseen issues that can delay the shipment of rewards to backers include, but are not limited to:* Delays in receiving components on time from vendors. * Delays from rejected parts during inspection. * Delays from the carrier in shipping the product to backers.As a backer of other projects, I understand the importance of honest communication, even if the news is not so good, so I will make it a priority to answer all backer questions as fast as I can and give updates as soon as possible.

<p>
</p><p>I have been going to the beach since I was a little kid in Florida, weekends with family and friends, surfing, picnics and relaxing in the sun next to the surf is what summer is all about. I want to share that experience with NYC and create a public park for everyone to enjoy and take a break from the concrete jungle we exist in everyday.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I’m a creative entrepreneur, experience designer and producer whose mission is to create experiences, environments and content that sparks meaningful connections. The moment this idea popped into mind, I knew I had to do it, it’s a perfect fit for what I’m all about.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My career has been a blend of all these elements.  I’ve been in the design and construction world since 2006 having supervised and renovated over 50,000 square feet of luxury residential and commercial space in NYC, and now I’m developing turnkey luxury properties around the country. Creating fun, dynamic and unique physical environments that have an impact is what I do.  </p>

<p>The best ideas are derived from necessity.</p>
<p>
</p><p>New York City is an island surrounded by water with no sand, it’s going to take a little vision to make it happen and I’ve got a plan. I want to make your summer time experience awesome and and here’s how I’m going to do it.  </p>
<p>
</p><p>My concept was created with my friends at <a href=""www.workshopapd.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><a href=""www.workshopapd.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">workshop/apd</a> and<a href=""www.craftengin.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Craft Engineering Studio</a> to emulate a relaxed seaside atmosphere and maximize the footprint of the barge we are building on top of. Challenged with the need for restaurants and entertainment space, without sacrificing the relaxed beauty of the dunes, Workshop/APD created what we like to call the “potato chip.” With an elevation of almost 16 feet at the ends of the structure, a natural amphitheater occurs and allows us to provide services underneath the beach without obstructing the amazing views, creating a 360 degree experience of the city and waterway surrounding us. </p>
<p>
</p><p>City Beach NYC is a community project, a social space, a creative achievement in design, and a platform to create possibility.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/765188/files/20140804080917-CBH_-_Front_03.jpg?1407164957"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><b>CROWDFUNDING AND YOU</b></p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;"">
</p><p>The purpose of this campaign is to raise awareness in our community, showing public support of the project to our city officials, investors and brand partners that we have your support. </p>
<p>
</p><p>The first milestone of the project develops the operational plan and begins the process with the local municipalities. The $35,000 raised during this phase allows us to hire the team we need to move the project to the next level. We’ve started off with donations as low as $10, but you can enter any amount you’d like, even $1. The goal here is showing your support.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The second milestone builds a scaled 3D model that allows the architects to explore the design in three dimensions. It will also be used to help illustrate to the community and city boards the functionality with the site and interaction the public will have once the barge is in place and costs $35,000.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The third milestone of the project invests in design development for architecture and structural engineering. Focusing more on the technical aspects and building materials, this phase allows us to understand the functions and systems further and is estimated at $150,000.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The next milestone moves into construction drawings, documentation, permitting applications, renderings and community outreach $185,000</p>
<p>

<p></p></div>","Let’s cut to the chase, MANHATTAN NEEDS A BEACH. We’ve got everything else, its clearly time and I need YOU to help get there. 

WHY AM I DOING THIS?

I have been going to the beach since I was a little kid in Florida, weekends with family and friends, surfing, picnics and relaxing in the sun next to the surf is what summer is all about. I want to share that experience with NYC and create a public park for everyone to enjoy and take a break from the concrete jungle we exist in everyday.

I’m a creative entrepreneur, experience designer and producer whose mission is to create experiences, environments and content that sparks meaningful connections. The moment this idea popped into mind, I knew I had to do it, it’s a perfect fit for what I’m all about.

My career has been a blend of all these elements.  I’ve been in the design and construction world since 2006 having supervised and renovated over 50,000 square feet of luxury residential and commercial space in NYC, and now I’m developing turnkey luxury properties around the country. Creating fun, dynamic and unique physical environments that have an impact is what I do.  
THE BIG IDEA
The best ideas are derived from necessity.

New York City is an island surrounded by water with no sand, it’s going to take a little vision to make it happen and I’ve got a plan. I want to make your summer time experience awesome and and here’s how I’m going to do it.  

My concept was created with my friends at workshop/apd andCraft Engineering Studio to emulate a relaxed seaside atmosphere and maximize the footprint of the barge we are building on top of. Challenged with the need for restaurants and entertainment space, without sacrificing the relaxed beauty of the dunes, Workshop/APD created what we like to call the “potato chip.” With an elevation of almost 16 feet at the ends of the structure, a natural amphitheater occurs and allows us to provide services underneath the beach without obstructing the amazing views, creating a 360 degree experience of the city and waterway surrounding us. 

City Beach NYC is a community project, a social space, a creative achievement in design, and a platform to create possibility.CROWDFUNDING AND YOU

The purpose of this campaign is to raise awareness in our community, showing public support of the project to our city officials, investors and brand partners that we have your support. 

The first milestone of the project develops the operational plan and begins the process with the local municipalities. The $35,000 raised during this phase allows us to hire the team we need to move the project to the next level. We’ve started off with donations as low as $10, but you can enter any amount you’d like, even $1. The goal here is showing your support.

The second milestone builds a scaled 3D model that allows the architects to explore the design in three dimensions. It will also be used to help illustrate to the community and city boards the functionality with the site and interaction the public will have once the barge is in place and costs $35,000.

The third milestone of the project invests in design development for architecture and structural engineering. Focusing more on the technical aspects and building materials, this phase allows us to understand the functions and systems further and is estimated at $150,000.

The next milestone moves into construction drawings, documentation, permitting applications, renderings and community outreach $185,000

It’s important for to us to work through each of these stages to get our build costs accurate so we know where we are headed and we reduce the surprises along the way. We’ve broken this down to help you understand that you are driving how fast the project can move, if you get behind us this project can be a reality by the summer of 2016. Now the question is how badly do you want it?WANT TO GO REALLY BIG?We’ve been looking high and low, new and old, but we anticipate the purchase to be roughly $1.4M, which includes tugging it from wherever its current home may be back to NY.  If you guys get us this far, I will be blown away.  New Yorkers like a challenge, so I'm putting it out there, ANYTHING is possible. 

Now on to the fun stuff...On the main deck, at the east end of the beach, a food court with two different, local restaurants greets beach goers before they head below to the changing rooms and the guest services desk. Complete with sunscreen, luxury lounge chair and towel rentals, we make it easy to travel light and spend the afternoon. Forget your suit? Not a problem, stop by our surf shop and head upstairs without missing a beat. 

The lower deck is also home to our kids history & marine science lab that are great for the whole family. Complete with marine touch tank and interactive kiosks, kids can learn about the history of the Hudson River, water quality and resident marine life in the park. Just around the corner our anchor restaurant, a double height dining room with light flooding in from the west, is the perfect place to enjoy a leisurely lunch or dinner.

Bikes die in the city: flat tires, rusty chains, stolen wheels, stolen lights, stolen seats…stolen bikes!
Invincible thrives in the city. It’s designed from the ground up to stop flats, rust and soggy butts and because everything is locked down with custom security hardware, it’s all 100% guaranteed against theft.
And best of all, we jammed it all into a convenient package that costs less than your phone.  
Invincible 1Speed for flat cities...


...and Invincible 8Speed for hilly cities.


 Ride with courage,


 enjoy the night, and


Lock up with confidence with a Best-In-Class Fortified U-Lock 




 We built a team for that...


 And how does FortifiedProtect actually keep your bike from being stolen?
When you buy Invincible, you're registered as the sole owner of your bike. The FortifiedProtect team manages ownership and makes sure that no Invincible bikes are resold without our permission. If an unauthorized bike does pop up for sale online, we make sure it's the last time that thief tries us.








When your FortifiedProtect expires, you can renew with an early backer discount.  
Next, add your accessories (at a discounted price).


 Just add the amount of each add-on to your final pledge.


Big bike companies haven’t figured out how to design bikes for the city. That’s where we come in. . .





ANTI-THEFT LIGHTS - The Aviator headlight and Afterburner taillight are constructed of lightweight aluminum and feature proprietary security bolts. If they’re ever broken or stolen, we’ll replace them.

My bag adventure has already proven to be such a rewarding experience and I can not wait for you to make your own Capsule memories.
 - Joey, Founder






With any new company there are certain risks associated. However, I have successfully launched other design projects so you can be confident that Capsule will be a high quality bag.
I am currently working with a professional liaison to mitigate any delays with the factory. They have successfully helped other companies navigate the sometimes difficult world of manufacturing. We have prepared for any challenges during the production process and will keep our backers updated through this entire process to remove any fear or hesitation associated with pledging funds.",44.0,0,"1 Campaign

We are proud to see where it has been since then. From Amsterdam to Cape Town, Moscow, Tokyo, New York to Ibiza, Bali and back to Amsterdam. AMS is the international code for Amsterdam Airport, 1275 stands for the official founding year of the city of Amsterdam.Explore #AMS1275 on instagram to see where Abel Tasman has been around the World.________________________________________________________________________________________CreditsCarolus floral design: Marian IJzendoorn @marianvij | Videos: Tim Kasper @tmkspr Eric @superdiksuperdik | Product photos: campaign-store.com Abel Tasman Carryall weekender bag by Amsterdenim www.amsterdenim.com | follow the blue journey @amsterdenim ________________________________________________________________________________________Other Ways You Can Help | We are grateful for any type of support and greatly appreciate your help in making some noise about this campaign.
