<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">I am Alysha Farling, a visual artist from Montreal, Quebec. I am originally from Victoria BC, which is where I grew up and also received an Art Diploma from Camosun College. After graduating, my partner and I decided to move to Montreal where I just recently graduated (this past April) from Concordia University, majoring in Drawing and Painting.</span></p><p><span style=""font-weight: normal;""></span></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/343759/files/20140201181005-Photo_on_2014-02-01_at_11.17.jpg?1391307005"" src="""" style=""""/></p><h3>what am I fundraising for?</h3>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">My Indigogo campaign is to fund myself to be able to participate in my first artist residency in La Plata, Argentina. The residency is one month long (all of May). And I will be working on a sculptural project and at the end of my stay I will be exhibiting what I've created. </span></p><p><span style=""font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: 0.06em; line-height: 1.45em; font-size: 15px;"">In order to explain a little about the project I plan to do while at this residency, I want to share the main inspiration behind my sculptural work. </span><br/></p><p><span style=""font-weight: normal; line-height: 1.45em; letter-spacing: 0.06em;""></span></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/343763/files/20140201181211-14_found_object.jpg?1391307131"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">When I was young I always wanted the ability to shrink down to the size of a mouse, bug, or something even smaller. I am an only child and grew up with a big garden and this is where I spent most of my time. I fantasized about living in between the little rocks, climbing up stalks of grass, and living in a damp world of moss. There was one shaded spot in particular, directly behind my house, where I would spend most of my time. When I sat myself down in front of these mossy rocks the whole world would grow around me and I would feel as though my hopes to shrink had come true. This garden was full of magic, the mossy rocks especially. </span></p><p><span style=""font-weight: normal;""></span></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/345198/files/20140202163351-407356_317699948275551_226379570740923_858619_1940539276_n.jpg?1391387631"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">As a kid, magic was easy to locate, but now I am finding it difficult. I am constantly trying to recreate the enchantment of that garden.

<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">I am also inspired by the fantastical animated worlds from cartoons, nature, the abject, and miniature things.

<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">For my project, I will be creating a giant character that will be wandering through the gallery.

As I walk, I will be collecting objects - anything that calls out to me. This may be garbage, elements from nature, strange trinkets, things large or small. I will then take these objects and manipulate them, cut them up, rearrange them and paint over them to create elements of a small world on the character's back that will be floating behind it - traveling with it.</span></p><p><span style=""font-weight: normal;""></span></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/345581/files/20140202211540-IMG_20140125_004005.jpg?1391404540"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p></p>

<h3 style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Our Story</h3>
<p>Hello from Rico and Takara, owners, artists and curators of the Rico Adair Gallery and Studios.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>We opened our current gallery and studio space in March 2011 to benefit the neighborhoods of North Hollywood and Valley Village because we saw a need to add to the adjacent NoHo arts districts visual arts scene. We have provided many established and underrepresented artists the opportunity to show their works in our gallery. <br/></p>
<p><br/></p>This space is very welcomed by everyone in the neighborhood with great enthusiasm! We started building a great community art space and people are coming out to support us. We've hosted numerous gallery exhibits, art workshops and we sell unique gift items made by local artisans. We've also added an organic coffee bar to create community, inspiration, conversation and expression of thoughts. <br/><br/>We see a great need for this space as a place for artists, entrepreneurs and families to gather, share their work, pool their resources and to learn from one another. This space has a positive energy all it's own and everyone feels it from the moment they walk in. It is unique, non-traditional and open to all forms of expression. We see the gallery as a  place where multidisciplinary arts can com together and flourish. Often, our art shows are interactive and show the artist's process.  Many of our exhibits have brought in 150 plus guest with visitors from the greater Los Angeles and San Fernando regions. <br/><br/><span style=""font-style: italic;""></span><span style=""font-style: italic;""><br/></span><p><font size=""3""><span style=""font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;"">The Breakdown of funds</span></font></p>

We work closely with them to promote awareness of our growing community.
 Along with the materials they provide to artists, they also provide

 the corner of our block is Square One framer. Where the artist or 
collector can get high crafted custom frames for their works of art.

My name is Tresa Bennett and I am the creator of Jiji's App and this is my very first time inventing a mobile app.  The app will feature art, music, kids games and you can scribble. What is Scribble? Scribble allows you to write messages with your finger or stylus when sending an instant message instead of texting. Just think when your child first learns to write their own name you can send it to the whole family. Also any art you or your child creates on the app can be posted to Facebook.</p>
<p>What excites me most about my app is that it will be a helpful tool for kids to communicate and express themselves especially kids who are not writing words yet. For kids who are writing or are just beginning to write it is a tool to practice and foster their writing skills while having fun. </p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 30px;""><b>The Goal:</b></span></p>
</div><div> <p></p>
<p>My mission with my
first app project is aimed at keeping kids creative while saving moms and dads
time and money .</p>
<p>The funds from my
Indiegogo campaign will give me the money I need to have a developer build my
app and put it in the App Store for iPhone users and make it available to android users.  These funds will get the app up and running with all the basic features loaded. </p>
<p>The funds will help keep the costs low and that will help me to keep
many free features on the app. I want everyone to have access to the app and
bring as much joy as possible to kids and their families and friends.<br/></p>

<h3>Help spread the word against Ivory poaching through Photography art.</h3>
<p>The only one of it's kind - so far</p>
<p>My name is Karue Wachira, a nature and wildlife photographer living in Kenya. I have dived in and out of photography and gone and epressed myself through other forms of art before I found myself back home - Photography.</p>
<p>I was Lucky enough to travel the country, Kenya, a lot last year (2012) and got very close to wildlife which I have been passionate about since I was a child. The travelling had its good times and not so good ones. The good times for me were when I get so close to wildlife and there was almost a communication between us - like they were reminding me who I really was and who I really am. It's an amazing feeling of serenity. The not so good times were every time I heard an animal has been killed by poachers. To think the future generations will miss this.</p>
<p>I have wanted to do this project for sometime, to be a part of the creating awareness about the poaching through my art but for lack of funds I opted to wait till I could fund it. So in my small way I have been raising awareness throug twitter :). A friend introduced me to Indiegogo.com and I was excited with the thought that the wait might be over.</p>
<p>This campaign through Photography art will help spread the awareness and touch a few more people to play a part against this evil. I would like this Stop Ivory Trade Photography Exhibtion in Nairobi to be the first part of the project. After this project is successful here in Nairobi, I would like to take part two of this project to 5 other major cities in the world. London, New York, Ottawa and especially Beijing and Hong Kong being in the East and the biggest market for illegal IVORY.</p>
<p>The exhibition will show from 12th August 2013 WORLD ELEPHANT DAY - 20th August 2013 at the KICC, Nairobi, Kenya.</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<h3>How we will do this together.</h3>
<p>With your genorous help you will help me spread the word in a different way. Beautifully I hope. The funds raised here will be used in:</p>
<p>Production which will include</p>
<p>1. An upgrade for some of my equipment - for that I will be forever gratefull :).  The equipment will help improve the quality of the art and help send the message out better</p>
<p>2. Transport around the wild while shooting</p>
<p>3. Accommodation and meals</p>
<p>The exhibition and the awareness</p>
<p>1. Printing the 24pcs on Canvas 24x36inches</p>
<p>2. Framing</p>
<p>3. Promotional material (Posters and fliers)</p>
<p>I would have loved to send some of the pieces to backers of the project but sending anything from here will need another fund raiser. For that reason I would like to sell these pieces and DONATE all the funds raised to A Rhino sanctuary in Kenya that is doing a very good job of saving RHINOS. With each framed 24x36inches canvas print being sold at USD 1000. I feel this way we will have achieved:</p>
<p>1. Help raise awareness against POACHING and IVORY trade</p>
<p>2. Help me gain more experience, exposure as a photographer and from here I'll walk away with upgraded equipment which I will be forever grateful.</p>
<p>3. With sale of the art, help the day to day conservation of Elephants, Rhinos and other animals in the wild with proceeds raised.</p>
<p>Note :: I have partnered with George's Legacy Fund run by a very passionate conservationist - Raabia Hawa where the proceeds from the sale of the art will go to, to help continue with the awesome job she is doing in conservation.</p>
<p>In the case that the funds raised are not fully sufficient I want to believe the project will still start and keep looking for funds to finish it. This should be a campaign that should not stop till the poaching stops or at least reduces significantly.</p>
<p>I have had an exhibition before to highlight the beauty of a forest within Nairobi through the life in the forest. 25% of the funds raised from the Exhibition was donated back to the forest for it's maintenance. This was through butterflies and was featured in a national newspaper - The Standard- both in print and their digital version</p>

<p>            We were formed 5 years ago with a group of passionate community members who believe in promoting environmental awareness and community engagement through the arts.  Our mission statement is “inspiring vibrant and connected communities by creating artistic experiences and nurturing a passion for nature.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p><em>            What is the Moon Festival? What’s its importance? </em></p>
<p>Still Moon founded the Moon Festival to celebrate the full moon and harvest abundance, and  honour diverse cultural traditions. The festival is instrumental as it not only brings awareness to the environment through the arts, but it does this while fostering intercultural relations and a sense of community. Today (September 29<sup>th</sup>, 2012) marks the 10<sup>th</sup> year of the festival, which on average brings together 3,000-5,000 community members each year.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>This festival is so important to our community as it brings attention to our local Renfrew Ravine. This ravine was used as a garbage dump and wasn’t appreciated by our community, but since the Moon Festival has begun we have witnessed a decrease in garbage and an increase in community interest in protecting the ravine.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Personally, I am a current university student and have been a part of the festival since grade 8. I have been able to grow with the festival and I find myself falling in love with its beauty year after year. Carmen Rosen, the artistic director, puts her heart and soul into running this festival every year and inspires thousands of people to appreciate their environments at the same time. It’s truly an incredible event and I hope to see it continue to flourish in the coming years.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>            <em>What is our goal?</em></p>
<p><em>            </em>We have had trouble with grants recently because of the large amounts of applications that they receive. A large part of our costs involve providing honourariums to our many staff and artists who work tirelessly to create a beautiful festival. We believe in paying artists the amount they deserve. In other organizations, artists’ wages are often the first to be cut under budget constraints. So to make sure the Moon Festival continues to run, we turn to our community members and Internet users from around the world to support our cause. We understand that there are many campaigns on this site, but we hope you can see what makes our festival unique and important. Our goal is currently $3,000, which will cover a portion of the costs and will help us greatly in our festival’s sustainability.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><em>            Perks?</em></p>
<p>            You don’t think that we would just gleefully accept your donations without providing a perk, did you? We have some very unique perks to provide, including 2012 Moon Festival T-shirts, all-expenses paid lantern workshops, tours of our unique Renfrew Ravine, and more! Of course, you will also receive eternal appreciation from all of the organizers behind the Moon Festival.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><em>            Will you help us?</em></p>
<p>            We can’t say enough how much we have appreciated the support we’ve received for the Moon Festival thus far. We hope to see future growth, and hope that you’ll stick around for the ride. In the meantime, we would appreciate your donations to make the festival possible. Share this page, invite your friends to the festival, and walk the Renfrew Ravine! Take care and thanks for your consideration. </p></div>","Who is the Still Moon Arts Society?

<p>Fine artist <strong>Larry Poncho Brown</strong> was invited to share his talents abroad with <strong>Artists 2 Africa</strong>, participating as a teacher on this tour representing his discipline of painting. He is one of several artists throughout the U.S. invited to teach other creative mediums including: <strong>Carren Clarke-Mcadoo (VA), Shurvon Haynes (WA), Jolyn E. Gardner (WA), Karen Y. Buster (MD), Tommy Roberts (MD), and Ethan Holland (PA),</strong> to name a few. A noteworthy group of American artists exchanging creative education with African artists!</p>
<p><strong>ABOUT A2A:</strong></p>
<p><strong>ARTISTS 2 AFRICA</strong> was birthed from decades of artists discussing the prospect of organizing a group journey to Africa tailored specifically for artists and focused on art education. <strong>On October 19-30, 2013 we will embark on our second official journey to Ghana West Africa!</strong></p>
<p>The artists will journey into the art villages on the outskirts of Ghana. Various artisans including painters, sculptors, and weavers will be gathered in their workshops to create and collaborate. We will fellowship with the artists and students, visit their workshops to share technique, and explore the creative process, while exchanging our creative ideas with the artisans in the region. An exhibition will be organized featuring the works of each artist. <strong>Our focus is to educate and connect through ART.</strong></p>

<p> </p></div>","ABOUT THE ARTIST:
Fine artist Larry Poncho Brown was invited to share his talents abroad with Artists 2 Africa, participating as a teacher on this tour representing his discipline of painting. He is one of several artists throughout the U.S. invited to teach other creative mediums including: Carren Clarke-Mcadoo (VA), Shurvon Haynes (WA), Jolyn E. Gardner (WA), Karen Y. Buster (MD), Tommy Roberts (MD), and Ethan Holland (PA), to name a few. A noteworthy group of American artists exchanging creative education with African artists!
ABOUT A2A:
ARTISTS 2 AFRICA was birthed from decades of artists discussing the prospect of organizing a group journey to Africa tailored specifically for artists and focused on art education. On October 19-30, 2013 we will embark on our second official journey to Ghana West Africa!
The artists will journey into the art villages on the outskirts of Ghana. Various artisans including painters, sculptors, and weavers will be gathered in their workshops to create and collaborate. We will fellowship with the artists and students, visit their workshops to share technique, and explore the creative process, while exchanging our creative ideas with the artisans in the region. An exhibition will be organized featuring the works of each artist. Our focus is to educate and connect through ART.

The infinite healing and love that I will experience at this retreat, held by my beloved Guru, will be infused into this next body of work. This is beginning of what my life and mission as an artist is: to share my spiritual journey into the heart of God with humanity; the journey into my own heart and my walk with an enlightened master. My vision is to share this love of God and self to the world through my work.</span></p>

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p><strong>We wish to emulate the famous Bauhaus which schooled and harbored some of the greatest of the 20th century artists.  studio spaces for freelance artists of any medium. a gymnasium and forum for exchanging ideas germane to truth, love and beauty. a cafeteria and a theater.</strong></p>
<p><strong>It will be called the NOHO Bauhaus</strong></p>
<p><strong><br/></strong></p>
<p><strong><br/></strong></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p><strong>NOHO (North Hollywood) is already a hotbed of writers, actors, painters, sculptors etc..  What we need is unity.  but not a formal union with all the bureaucratic encumbrances;  just a place to work with others; a place for accomplished artists to transmit their knowledge in their field.</strong></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p><strong>Like the model, the Bauhaus can become self sufficient.  All we need is <u>creative people</u> working together to create what will in time be as legendary as the Bauhaus.  a lump sum to lease the buildings for five years is the aim.  we can accrue equipment as we go along.  these buildings in North Hollywood have been vacant for as long as i have been here, which is four years.  every single dollar will help, but a generous donation will yield for the giver all kinds of lovely benefits and appreciations.</strong></p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p><strong>If you are an artist living in the area you can not only contribute what you can in dollars but get together with us to launch fund raising campaigns on the ground.  a collaborative auction/masquerade party to meet and greet and spread some excitement. we need all the help we can get.</strong></p>

There's two of us in this; Lissy Marlin, artist and traveler, and me, Barbara Perez, editor and consultant. 
Last year, Lissy went to 4 different countries between May and June. Now, we've put together an AMAZING collection of art inspired by these places. Along with this, there's also stories and commentary about her trip. Here's where YOU come in! You could get yourself a copy of this awesome book through this campaign.The book is going to be approximately 150 pages of delightful, original art! It's split in sections covering the countries Lissy visited. From the canals of The Netherlands, the traditions in Germany, seeing art in France, and walking through Spain.We will be printing 500 copies of the book and creating a pack of 5 postcards (80 packs available) from some of the art from the book. UPDATE (7/10/2014): ALL PERKS $25+ WILL NOW INCLUDE AN 8 PIECE STICKER SET! BECAUSE EVERYONE LOVES STICKERS AND WE LOVE YOU FOR HELPING US!UPDATE (8/1/2014): We will be printing another batch of postcards and after allocating some of the books have added 25 more slots to each of the 'Explorer' and 'Frequent Flyer' Perks.Keep on reading, let's talk about the details!               As mentioned, the book will be approximately 150 pages long and here's the specs for it:8x8 inches, perfect binding, and glossy cardstock cover.Sections include:
Intro 
Germany
Netherlands 
France 
Spain 
The postcards will be printed on cardstock and have a glossy finish. They will feature art from the book and will be 5x7 inches. We will be printing 400 of these, which will make for a total of 80 5-packs.Our priority is to bring YOU a quality product, in order to do that, we're going to have to meet our goal which will help us cover the following costs:Printing Costs - We'll be working closely with the press to guarantee that the final product will not disappoint. Shipping - Once the book is done, we want to make sure it makes it to you in a timely and successful matter. Materials - Once the book is done, we want to make sure it makes it to you in a timely and successful matter. We're going to need envelopes and additional elements to ensure a safe delivery. A lot of the art in the book will be digital, HOWEVER, Lissy is making 10 traditional-styled pieces that will be featured in the book and making these will also require some additional resources. More details on these later on! Other Expenses - Even though we are totally awesome, Lissy and I learned the hard way that money doesn't grow on trees. We tried. This project will take time and effort that we are more than glad to invest. Unfortunately, we are working long distance and these funds will help us greatly to cover costs of travel to each other once the more demanding parts of the project come around. Any leftover funds after that will help us bring other projects to light in the future!We are not letting you go empty handed though! As we build up to meet our goal, these perks will make sure that you are satisfied with your investment:Don't forget: ALL PERKS INCLUDE DOMESTIC SHIPPING WITHIN THE USA!   Lissy and I have known each other for a while, but this is our first adventure publishing something together. This would be the first of several projects we've got in mind. Seeing this campaign reach its goal would only add to our motivation to continue bringing our work to the world!Here's some of our background:                                                 Lissy attended The University of The Arts in Philadelphia, PA. She's a freelance illustrator and has interned at Applehead Factory. If you are not familiar with her work, you can check her website at www.lissymarlin.com                                                    Barbara is an MFA candidate at Manhattanville College in Purchase, NY. She's a fiction writer and she's edited for Inkwell Magazine and The Manhattanville Review. You can check her stuff here: www.mustachebabs.comWe don't want this just to be special for us though, we want to include you! That's why we want this project to bring you little nuggets of our hard work through the perks we already mentioned! We seriously thank you for just reading this, Like everything in life, there's always the possibility of risks. If any were to arise, we'll make sure to notify you immediately! As far as we can envision, these are the immediate things that could detour from a timely fulfillment of the project: 

Delays, whether during printing or shipping.

Life, we'll do our best to keep it from interfering but some things are out of our control.

I started painting in 2015 after becoming chronically and dangerously ill. I had studied fine arts and photography in college and planned on pursuing photography as a career.

Yours will be freshly sewn :) Making a cameo in this is a prototype of an LED cork-light. <br/><br/><b>Health Stuff:<br/><br/></b></p><p><b>Sadly, it looks like I'm not going to 
raise even $100, which still isn't enough pay for my upcoming medical 
bill. Trying to raise this money was pretty much the only reason I've 
fought myself to simply stay alive and continue trying. At this point, 
I've been trying to raise money to transition for nearly a year with 
little success. Due to circumstances beyond my control, I haven't been 
able to get a job and the money I had raised earlier in the year went to
 a therapist in hopes they could write a recommendation for medical 
treatment (they could not).<br/><br/>While it might seem like I'm a 
chronically depressed individual who needs a psychologist and 
antidepressants, I've tried both for years. Psychotherapy hasn't helped 
me at all, despite my sincere efforts to jump through their hoops. 
Antidepressants have been worse - when they work, they induce a 
pseudomania that I'm not equipped to function under and my ability to 
make rational decisions is severely compromised. In short, what will 
make me a functional individual is HRT. While I realize antidepressants 
may be a more common treatment for depression, remember that I'm 
treating a chemical imbalance in my body, which is the underlying 
problem in my existence, instead of a non-existent chemical imbalance in
 my brain.</b></p><p><b><b>I realize a year may not seem like a long 
time and in some senses it isn't. However, add to that the past 
decade-and-a-half of struggling with my gender identity to begin to 
understand how frustrated I am living like this. To finally have come to
 understand myself and take action is the culmination of a lifetime of 
pain. Pain I want to end, preferably by becoming the person I truly am.</b></b></p><p><b><b><b>This
 fairly-unsuccessful campaign was my last hope, a desperate attempt to 
finally ask other people for help. Despite my best efforts, I've found 
myself more desperate and disheartened, due to the continued lack of 
success and increasing nearness of the endocrinologist appointment 
that's scheduled four days after this campaign ends.<br/><br/>And while 
this campaign page isn't fancy, I had hoped people would take action to 
help me. After continuing to trt my best to make this the best page that
 I can, I've had two donors (Babs &amp; Sarah, thank you again) in about
 two weeks of running this campaign. Apparently I was generally wrong 
that people would be willing to take action. For the next two weeks, 
I'll keep trying  even though I'm losing hope. There are two weeks left 
to help me. After that point, I don't know if I'll have any hope left.</b></b></b></p><br/></div>","(I took the video down, since there are only several days left - check out my art and donate to help me make more art and stuff)Visit my Deviantart to see the most recent Pocket Art!!!Howdy, I'm Josie Nemo and I'm a transsexual.

And so for me to succeed in life, it's a necessity.But I don't just want to rely on the kindness of friends and strangers - I'm hoping to get enough donations so that I can also make my business self-sustaining. For it to flourish, I need to be able to buy more supplies.Some of those supplies will be a sewing machine and other sewing supplies, tubing and electronics for LED hulahoops and wands, ink pens, and gardening supplies. I intend to sell LED wands and hoop, upcycled garments and accessories, art, and eventually plant starts for local gardeners.Regardless of whether I reach my goal, you will receive the listed perks. Your generosity will help me fulfill myself as a woman as well as become financially self-sustaining. Thank you for taking the time to consider this.Please check out the perks pictured and listed below, as well as my Facebook, it has more examples of more, as does my DeviantArt account:LED Wands unlit and lit. Stayed tuned for YouTube videos of me dancing with them. Newer wands will be slightly more impressive!My original upcycled bag, still serving me well after years of use. Yours will be freshly sewn :) Making a cameo in this is a prototype of an LED cork-light. Health Stuff:Sadly, it looks like I'm not going to 
raise even $100, which still isn't enough pay for my upcoming medical 
bill. Trying to raise this money was pretty much the only reason I've 
fought myself to simply stay alive and continue trying. At this point, 
I've been trying to raise money to transition for nearly a year with 
little success. Due to circumstances beyond my control, I haven't been 
able to get a job and the money I had raised earlier in the year went to
 a therapist in hopes they could write a recommendation for medical 
treatment (they could not).While it might seem like I'm a 
chronically depressed individual who needs a psychologist and 
antidepressants, I've tried both for years. Psychotherapy hasn't helped 
me at all, despite my sincere efforts to jump through their hoops. 
Antidepressants have been worse - when they work, they induce a 
pseudomania that I'm not equipped to function under and my ability to 
make rational decisions is severely compromised. In short, what will 
make me a functional individual is HRT. While I realize antidepressants 
may be a more common treatment for depression, remember that I'm 
treating a chemical imbalance in my body, which is the underlying 
problem in my existence, instead of a non-existent chemical imbalance in
 my brain.I realize a year may not seem like a long 
time and in some senses it isn't. However, add to that the past 
decade-and-a-half of struggling with my gender identity to begin to 
understand how frustrated I am living like this. To finally have come to
 understand myself and take action is the culmination of a lifetime of 
pain. Pain I want to end, preferably by becoming the person I truly am.This
 fairly-unsuccessful campaign was my last hope, a desperate attempt to 
finally ask other people for help. Despite my best efforts, I've found 
myself more desperate and disheartened, due to the continued lack of 
success and increasing nearness of the endocrinologist appointment 
that's scheduled four days after this campaign ends.And while 
this campaign page isn't fancy, I had hoped people would take action to 
help me. After continuing to trt my best to make this the best page that
 I can, I've had two donors (Babs & Sarah, thank you again) in about
 two weeks of running this campaign. Apparently I was generally wrong 
that people would be willing to take action. For the next two weeks, 
I'll keep trying  even though I'm losing hope. There are two weeks left 
to help me. After that point, I don't know if I'll have any hope left.",3.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<p>That’s the bottom line for our project – an unlikely trans-Atlantic collaboration between Jamie Murphy, a Dublin-based designer and letterpress printer, and Steve Cole, a James Joyce fanatic from Baltimore. We are out to bring the unique wit, warmth, and quirkiness of the everyman hero from James Joyce’s <em>Ulysses</em> to light for the first time in a glorious letterpress printed limited edition artist’s book.</p>
<p>We want to have this new book completed in time for this year’s celebration of <em>Ulysses</em> on the 16th of June – a day known around the world as <strong>BLOOMSDAY</strong>.</p>
<p>What? You haven’t read <em>Ulysses</em>? Well, who can blame you. It is a monster of a book. At over 700 pages and written in a dozen different styles (some utterly bizarre) it is not an easy read. But there’s a reason why it is widely considered the greatest novel in the English language. <em>Ulysses</em> gets inside and behind and underneath a human life like no other book. And that whirlwind of styles opens your eyes to a whole new way of seeing and reading.</p>
<p>With this project we boil down the essence of Leopold Bloom into a collection of his thoughts and sayings. We want this book to help the uninitiated experience Bloom’s all-too-human world view. For Joyce junkies the book will be a fresh look at Bloom through his quips &amp; quirks. And to make this experience really special, we’re bringing out our “Quotations from Chairman Bloom” in a large-format hand-printed volume that will be a wonder to behold (and hold).</p>
<p><strong>WE JUST WANT TO PLEASE MOLLY BLOOM</strong></p>
<p>Truth be told, the idea for this Joycean undertaking is not ours. We stole it. Not from a living being, mind you. We lifted it from no greater an authority on Leopold Bloom than his own wife, the erotic and unfaithful Molly Bloom. Mrs. Bloom, in her bed at the end of that eventful day in 1904, muses admiringly about her spouse: <em>“I declare somebody ought to put him in the budget if I only could remember the one half of the things and write a book out of it <strong>the works of Master Poldy</strong> yes.”</em></p>
<p>“The Works of Master Poldy” is our second collaboration together involving <em>Ulysses</em>, letterpress printing and Dublin. We were strangers just a year ago. In early 2012 Steve was revving up for a second year of feeding his <em>Ulysses</em> addiction, which in 2011 burst onto the global scene with a 24-hour Twitter rendition of the whole novel. Jamie was wrapping up his M.A. degree at Dublin’s National College of Art &amp; Design and bringing out his letterpress book “Albert, Ernest &amp; the Titanic.”</p>
<p>To mark the end of copyright on Joyce’s published works in Europe last year, Steve launched the LiberateUlysses project to encourage multimedia expressions based on the novel for Bloomsday 2012. He was eager to indulge another passion – letterpress printing – and thought it would be cool to work with a Dublin printer on a Bloomsday project. Of course, he didn’t know any.</p>
<p>But through the miracle of Twitter, Steve found Jamie @fjorddesign and together with @maryjplunkett they brought out a series of large colorful broadsides of <em>Ulysses</em> quotes, printed at the fantastic @DistillersPress in Dublin. Our “Ulysses Strands” posters were a great success and are now sold out.</p>
<p><strong>A BOOK PRINTED BY HAND IN DUBLIN</strong></p>
<p>Our project will be the first publication from Jamie’s new book arts &amp; letterpress printing venture in Dublin – <em>The Salvage Press</em> – which he established just this year. The Salvage Press is devoted to preserving, promoting and pursuing excellence in design, typography and letterpress printing. Jamie has a huge interest in finely printed artists’ books, having recently completed an award-winning tome based on the printers who travelled aboard the Titanic in 1912.</p>
<p>Handprinting a beautiful book like this takes a LOT of time, and we will be going all-out to get it done ahead of Bloomsday. That’s less than three months away, so it’s going to be a MAD dash! Don’t hate us if we miss that date by a few days, but be assured we are doing everything possible to make sure “Master Poldy” arrives in time for his big day.</p>
<p>So pitch in and help us realize Molly Bloom’s century-old publishing vision! We believe that the world will be a little better off with this letterpress book in it. We hope you do too.</p>
<p><strong>WHAT WE NEED TO CREATE “MASTER POLDY”</strong></p>
<p>This new book will be printed at the amazing Distillers Press, National College of Art and Design, in Dublin, where Jamie is about to undertake a design residency for the coming year. Our Indiegogo campaign funds the design, typesetting (both monotype casting and hand-set metal and wooden type), letterpress printing and hand binding of “Master Poldy” using traditional letterpress methods. Jamie is handling all of this and is already at work on the design of what we know will be a beautiful book. Steve has already finished harvesting a rich crop of Bloomisms from <em>Ulysses</em>.</p>
<p>The funds we raise go toward the labor and materials needed to produce an edition of 120 copies by early June 2013. If we raise more than our goal, we plan to start work on bringing “Master Poldy” out in other formats that will let us put the book into the hands of more people.</p>
<p>“Master Poldy” will be a 40-page book, case bound within a protective slipcase, measuring about 10 x 15 inches. (We’ll also have a deluxe edition with a more elaborate binding and some hidden extras.) It will be letterpress printed onto Zerkell mould made paper, keeping the beautiful deckled edge where possible. We’ll be using a mix of traditional monotype methods and handset antique wooden type in an experimental typographic design. By creating the book at Distillers Press, we have over 500 cases of type to choose from.</p>
<p><strong>WHAT YOU GET FOR CONTRIBUTING</strong></p>
<p>We’ve come up with lots of fun perks that will please Joyce addicts and letterpress enthusiasts alike.</p>
<p>We are designing original stickers using lots of letterpress-printed type in three new designs and a set of Bloom-inspired postcards letterpress printed from wooden and metal type – all great ways to share your love for the craft of letterpress printing and the writings of James Joyce. You can also receive a large typographic poster (letterpress printed, of course) inspired straight from the mind of Leopold Bloom. These will be fantastic colorful pieces printed by hand on mould-made paper in a small edition.</p>
<p>You can also receive the standard and deluxe editions of “The Works of Master Poldy.” The standard edition will be a beautiful book – a very special keepsake for Joyce enthusiasts and the avid bibliophiles. The deluxe edition will have a more elaborate binding/housing with some special extras included.</p>
<p>Our top-level contributors will receive a personal tour of Distillers Press and a celebratory meal with us in Dublin on Bloomsday weekend 2013.</p>
<p>If you can’t contribute financially but want to help us bring “Master Poldy” to life, we’d really appreciate your help in spreading the word about our project.

Free admission is a long-standing tradition in the not-for-profit artist-run network in Québec and Canada. This campaign is intended for lovers of art who are looking for altruistic opportunities to support living artists and their organisation.
<br/><br/>
VIVA! is a Montréal-based international event that draws artists from every continent. With significantly less funding than past years, VIVA! still manages to offer decent work conditions and generous hospitality to our guest artists. Instead of charging everyone at the door, VIVA! is asking those who can to make donations using either the Indiegogo platform or by dropping some coin into the VIVA! penguin bank, located at the entrance of the Bain St-Michel. Funds collected with this campaign will mostly go toward keeping the event alive in the off-year, between festivals.  
<br/><br/>
Of course, VIVA! is grateful to the Montréal and Québec arts councils for their operating and project funding, which allows artist-run centres <a href=""http://www.articule.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">articule</a>, <a href=""http://www.dare-dare.org/en"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">DARE-DARE</a>, Centre <a href=""http://www.clarkplaza.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">CLARK</a>, <a href=""http://www.lacentrale.org/en"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">La Centrale</a> Galerie Powerhouse, <a href=""http://www.oboro.net/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">OBORO</a>, <a href=""http://www.praxisartactuel.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Praxis</a> Art Actuel, le Centre des arts actuels <a href=""http://skol.ca/en"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Skol </a>and <a href=""http://galerieverticale.com/web/wb/pages/fr/actualites.php?lang=EN"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Verticale </a>– centre d’artistes to collaborate on the 4th edition of this biennial event. 
<br/><br/>
With a fully operational kitchen set up in the Bain Saint Michel, VIVA! offers daily meals at a low cost to members of the public who wish to mingle with this special crop of artists. Everyone that has attended past editions of VIVA! will remember the tasty meals provided by Berlin-based artist-cook SP 38, who, for this edition, was invited to design the 2013 logo using his signature font. This year’s suppers will be prepared by Toronto artist Basil AlZeri and will culminate with a closing performance.
<br/><br/>
We encourage you to attend at least one evening of performances during the event and, if you absolutely can’t, why not follow the daily actions on our blog featuring authors Jacob Wren and Marc-Antoine K.

S'inscrivant dans une longue tradition des centres d'artistes autogérés au Québec et au Canada, VIVA! souhaite poursuivre sa mission en permettant au public de participer gratuitement à toutes les activités du festival Cette campagne s'adresse à ceux et celles qui aiment l'art actuel et qui souhaitent faire un don en soutien aux artistes de la performance et de l'art action et aux organismes qui les soutiennent.

GARDONS VIVA! LIBRE

VIVA! est une manifestation internationale d'art performance située à Montréal qui présente des artistes de partout au monde. Ayant obtenu moins de financement que dans le passé, VIVA! fait l'impossible pour offrir des conditions de travail décentes et un accueil généreux aux artistes invités. 







Plutôt que de recourir à une billetterie – un développement qui irait à l’encontre du désir de garder VIVA! accessible à tous – VIVA! demande à ceux et celles qui le peuvent, de faire un don soit au moyen de cette plateforme Indiegogo, ou encore, en déposant des sous directement dans la tirelire pingouin installée bien en vue, à l’entrée du Bain St-Michel. Les fonds recueillis durant cette campagne serviront à maintenir minimalement les activités de l'organisme durant l'année off, entre deux festivals.



Certes, VIVA! est reconnaissant à l’endroit du Conseil des arts de Montréal et du Conseil des arts et des lettres du Québec pour leur soutien au fonctionnement et au projet, fonds qui permettent aux centres d’artistes articule, DARE-DARE, Centre CLARK, La Centrale Galerie Powerhouse, OBORO, Praxis Art Actuel, le Centre des arts actuels Skol et Verticale de collaborer à la 4e édition de cet événement biennal. 




Avec sa cuisine fonctionnelle aménagée dans l’ancien vestiaire du Bain St-Michel, VIVA! offre des repas équilibrés à prix modique aux membres du public qui veulent côtoyer cette unique communauté d’artistes. Ceux et celles qui ont assisté aux éditions antérieures de VIVA! se rappelleront les délicieux repas préparés par l’artiste SP38, qui pour cette édition 2013, a produit le logo avec sa police bien singulière. Pour cette édition, les repas seront préparés par l’artiste Torontois Basil ALZeri dont le service culminera avec une performance le dernier soir du festival. 




Nous vous invitons à venir assister à une ou à toutes les soirées; et, pour ceux et celles qui ne pourront être présents, vous pourrez suivre toutes les actions en lisant les chroniques de nos blogueurs Jacob Wren et Marc-Antoine K. Phaneuf. La programmation détaillée est disponible sur le site de VIVA!




HELP KEEP VIVA! FREE



Free admission is a long-standing tradition in the not-for-profit artist-run network in Québec and Canada. This campaign is intended for lovers of art who are looking for altruistic opportunities to support living artists and their organisation.

VIVA! is a Montréal-based international event that draws artists from every continent. With significantly less funding than past years, VIVA! still manages to offer decent work conditions and generous hospitality to our guest artists. Instead of charging everyone at the door, VIVA! is asking those who can to make donations using either the Indiegogo platform or by dropping some coin into the VIVA! penguin bank, located at the entrance of the Bain St-Michel. Funds collected with this campaign will mostly go toward keeping the event alive in the off-year, between festivals.  

Of course, VIVA! is grateful to the Montréal and Québec arts councils for their operating and project funding, which allows artist-run centres articule, DARE-DARE, Centre CLARK, La Centrale Galerie Powerhouse, OBORO, Praxis Art Actuel, le Centre des arts actuels Skol and Verticale – centre d’artistes to collaborate on the 4th edition of this biennial event. 

With a fully operational kitchen set up in the Bain Saint Michel, VIVA! offers daily meals at a low cost to members of the public who wish to mingle with this special crop of artists. Everyone that has attended past editions of VIVA! will remember the tasty meals provided by Berlin-based artist-cook SP 38, who, for this edition, was invited to design the 2013 logo using his signature font. This year’s suppers will be prepared by Toronto artist Basil AlZeri and will culminate with a closing performance.

We encourage you to attend at least one evening of performances during the event and, if you absolutely can’t, why not follow the daily actions on our blog featuring authors Jacob Wren and Marc-Antoine K. Phaneuf?For more info and programming, visit the VIVA! website.

Around that same time Ifounded Tight Joint Productions with a few friends who were involved in the burgeoning electronic dance music scene. During that time I experimented with psychedelics which led to a heightened awareness of consiousness and changed his outlook on the possibilities of art.</span></p>

</div>
<div>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>here's the breakdown:</p>
<p>I have been invited to show art at<em> <strong>numerous</strong> </em>events around the country and the world but due to the cost of printing, shipping and travel expenses I've had to decline most offers.</p>
<ul>
<li>a canvas costs me about $200 to print and ship and I need at least 10 canvases for a total of roughly $2000</li>
<li>Plane tickets and food money come out to another $1500</li>
<li>the latest event I've been invited to is Channel Zero in Slovenia and BaliFest in Indonesia.</li>
</ul>
<p>If I receive funding I will be able to pay for printing and shipping the canvases to the next event and I will cover my plane tickets. </p>
</div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>My art is intended to raise the collective consciousness to a higher vibrational frequency through the use of sacred geometry and universal visions. I believe that imagery is very porweful and has the ability to effect positive change in peoples lives, I will also be donating a percentage of my final art sales to ""The Salvation Army"" since they helped out my mother when I was a child.</p>

<h3>The Boat:</h3>
<p>A 1969 Vivacity Twin Keel M.O.R.C. (Midget Ocean Racing Class) with a Ford Drive Axel to propel it on land. With a vintage Wisconsin Engine at its heart, this is both an artistic and engineering masterpiece. At Burning Man, it will act as both art and public transportation for its well deserving citizens. </p>
<h3>The Plan:</h3>
<p>The Boat is 85% built, and has proven to be a solid design. During the past year, Andrew has planned and executed an incredibly aggressive build. All of the major purchasing of parts and construction has been completed, and she is currently being beta-tested and refined daily. In light of the tremendous financial burden and the time of traveling across the country with such a heavy piece, we have made the decision to permanently store the Boat and transport truck in Nevada, thus allowing the Boat to be used for future Burns and possibly Wasteland Weekend.</p>
<p>Any and all replacement parts need to be on hand due to the remoteness and time constraints of the event; otherwise the smallest problem will result in complete failure. To this end, we intend to purchase backups of every major component being used on the Boat.</p>
<p>After the event, the boat will be washed, shrink wrapped, and prepped for storage. It will be left in Nevada for the following year, thus creating a sustainable project plan. We will need to pay for a storage facility for the year.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Andrew has already surpassed his financial, mental, and physical limits getting to this point, so we need donations to purchase extra components for the Boat, storage space, insurance, and transportation costs. </p>
<p>One of the core principles of Burning Man is gifting. In order to defray the costs, perks and rewards will be at a minimum. T-shirts and stickers will be given to charitable donors. Large donations will be given private art tours and works of art by Andrew.</p>

<h3>What is The Good of The Hive?</h3>
<p>The Good of the Hive is an artistic initiative founded by mural artist Matthew Willey to raise awareness about the importance of honeybees and celebrate their incredible behaviors. Matthew has committed to personally <strong>hand-paint 50,000 honeybees</strong> - the number in a healthy, thriving, hive - in murals around the world.</p> <p>These mural sites become local points of focus for people to come together around this global issue. Through mural painting, The Good of the Hive encourages us all to cultivate our connection with honeybees.</p>

<h3>What are the funds being raised for?</h3>
<ol>
<li>Alleviating financial pressure for communities that want to bring the initiative but don't have the resources. </li>
<li>Filming and editing so we can share the story of this local project with a global audience.</li>
</ol>
<p>We are working with seasoned professionals like Yeti Nest Films to tell this story in a way that uplifts and excites the viewer. We believe that real connections, face-to-face are the most powerful healing element humans possess, but the second, and a much more expensive one, is video and film.</p> <h3>What has been done so far?</h3>
<p>Last year was a flying success!  We painted 8 murals with <strong>over 1250 honeybees</strong> in them! We brought the initiative and the bees to an elementary school, a museum, a global corporation, a fire station, a dressing room at Fiddler on the Roof on Broadway, a skate park and beyond.</p> <p>The Good of the Hive put out short form videos about the work and started gathering footage for our first documentary film. We conducted interviews with kids, beekeepers and bee-advocates. We engaged people with the bees through social media, inspired classrooms of kids and teachers to get excited about bees and Matthew literally had thousands of one-on-one conversations with people about bees.</p> <h3>What will The Good of the Hive be doing in the future?</h3>
<p>It was an incredible year… but it was just the beginning.</p>
<p><strong>With your help</strong>, The Good of the Hive is going to continue to create more murals that engage and inspire people. The Good of the Hive offers a place to hover in art, nature and connection with other people. We want to bring that energy to as many places as possible going forward, so we’re also creating large-scale installation art pieces that can travel in order to expand the reach and the experience of the initiative. We are also setting a goal of creating our first longer documentary film about the work. We will be adding new elements and experiences such as mini film festivals and art shows at mural sites to build momentum around the bees that literally changes the way people see and interact with these amazing creatures.</p> <p>This mission is 15 years long for a reason. The artist, Matthew Willey, believes that the problems we are facing need long term commitment from individuals to spark the fire of change and then follow through with the time and effort for the change to take hold. He is living and breathing this with his work. In it’s fully realized form, The Good of the Hive is a <strong>thriving movement of people inspired to rediscover and cultivate our connection with the natural world</strong>. The bees are a muse and the conduit for connection between these two things for the artist.</p> <p>Matthew believes that if we can align with what needs to be done to get the bees thriving again, we will be in an incredible position of having done something giant together. The bees are not interested in borders or what color or religion a person was born into. They care about their hives and the landscape. They simply and naturally perpetuate the health of the landscape they are in…  and so does The Good of the Hive. We are a global art project that works locally. Artist Matthew Willey <strong>is on a mission to get the world to remember that if nothing else, there is one tiny thing we can all agree on… the bee. And if we can agree on one thing, we may just remember how to agree on other things as well.</strong></p>

<h3><strong>Why is it important to do this work in THIS way?</strong></h3>
<p>Art and nature touch everyone. They are a vital part of every fully realized human life. The Good of the Hive is working to be a vehicle for people to access art, beauty, and nature in profound and lasting ways. And because we are a ‘for benefit’ company (meaning our bottom line is always the bees and not the dollars) we have the possibility to expand to whatever scale is necessary to create whatever kind of change is necessary for the good of beehives and the good of human hives. And because an artist is at the helm of this growing company, beauty, compassion, healing and sensitivity are all active parts of the ‘business’ model. We believe that people and animals like bees create the reality of the world. <strong>We believe that inherently people, like bees, are good. And we are creating an initiative that harnesses that energy and invites people to join us in a wave of change that is not against something, but rather ‘for’ the good of it.</strong></p>

<h1>Who are we?</h1>
<p>Patrick and I (Vicky Chen) met 3 years ago at New York University Tisch asia, school of the arts in Singapore. He is a teacher while I worked closely with NYU as an actor on multiple short films.</p>
<p>Coming from Manhattan New York, Patrick was used to film screenings at bars and wanted to bring this casual, fun and creative spirit to Singapore. So, while having a beer and chips at Emerald Hill, we came up with Cartoons Underground.</p>
<p>Being a local, I had the contacts who helped to make this event happen while Patrick knew animators who wanted to showcase their work. </p>
<p>Patrick Smith is an international award-winning animator from New York. Currently, he teaches animation at  New York University Tisch Asia of the Arts in Singapore.</p>
<p>His directorial debut was for the Emmy-nominated series <em><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downtown_(TV_series)"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Downtown (TV series)"">Down-Town</a></em>, continuing on to direct the popular animated series <em><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daria"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Daria"">Daria</a></em>. Since then he has directed a handful of short films which earned him much reputation at film festivals worldwide as well as numerous awards. Besides those short films Smith creates commercials as well as pieces of installation art, sometimes published as street art (and eventually stolen).</p>
<p>The co-founder of <a href=""http://www.Scribbledjunkes.blogspot.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.Scribbledjunkes.blogspot.com</a> with Bill Plympton, you may read more about his art, inspirations, travel and writing. </p>
<p>Vicky Chen is an undergraduate studying business at SMU. She spends her time reading comics, traveling and painting. The owner of Chromaki, an online boutique that sells mainly, vintage clothing. </p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We need PHOTOGRAPHERS, animators, artists and VOLUNTEERS!</p>
<p>Please contact us at <a href=""mailto:cartoonsunderground@gmail.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">cartoonsunderground@gmail.com</a> if you're interested.</p>
<h3><strong>Risk and Challenges</strong></h3>
<p>Being the first underground animation festival in a totally informal setting, the most essential part is getting the right crowd and media to cover the event.<br/><br/>How to ensure the right crowd and media coverage, you ask?</p>
<p>Luckily, we have Patrick Smith onboard, who has gotten the permission from different animators to showcase the shorts for free. Also, he has the experience of organising and being part of multiple famous international film festivals. For the past 3 years, he has organised the annual Scribble Junkies animation event in America that showcased 2D animation shorts. Every year, Scribble Junkies animation event drew in a large crowd with hundreds of animators sending in their 2d works to be screened during the event.</p>
<p>However, this is located in Singapore and the art community here is small. Although this may facilitate the dispersion of information, it might mean that we have a smaller turnout. In regard to overcoming the challenge, we have to expand the invitation to anyone who may be interested.</p>
<p>Being a local, I was the executive head of marketing at Singapore Management University's largest community service event, StarringSMU in 2011. StarringSMU involved 10 000 members of the public and 3000 students. Between 2005 - 2008, I worked as a runner for events at clubs such as Zouk, selling tickets. This gave me the opportunity to connect with club owners, event organisations and influencers. I was able to use my experience and network to not only gather the help and promote the event to the general public but also in securing the venue for the event.</p>

</div></div>","Ever felt bored and frustrated in Singapore? Sick of not having cool stuff to do? 
Want to contribute to some thing bigger than you?
We welcome People, Artists, Animators, Babies and Pandas to inject color into Singapore's art scene. 
Outta boredom, Pat and I decided to have Singapore's first Underground Animation Festival; Cartoons Underground @ Home Club. 29th Nov 2012, 7pm.
A showcase and collaboration of award-winning international and local animation shorts, most of which have been practically restricted in Asia ! 
CARTOONS UNDERGROUND
Singapore’s first underground animation festival at a club, brought to you by Vicky Chen and MTV legend Patrick Smith (Beavis & Butthead, Daria).
Grab a beer and a fistful of popcorn with fans and creators of awardwinning animated films from Sundance, Tribeca and Hong Kong that are making their debut in Asia.
You’ll be greeted with the right mix of mind altering and raunchy films that have practically been restricted in Singapore before. Get ready for heart palpitating scenes and plots that will drive you the edge of reality while socialising with the creators themselves!
Mind-blowing with a tinge of naughtiness, you'll witness animated short films and animated music videos by Patrick Smith, Bill Plymton, Andreas Hykaden and Bill Plympton as well as local talent Yanyun Chen, Sara Chong and more.
Admission is FREE, but we rely on your support so please keep your bar tab healthy!

Funding
This is a non-profit event, artists, animators and even Home Club are not being paid.

Extra $$ garnered from this kickstarter will go to the artists and animators that contributed. 
Rewards & Artists
We have a whole list of amazing rewards for you ranging from POPCORN to POSTCARDS to HANDCRAFTED drawings by super talented local and international artists and Patrick Smith.

Who are we?
Patrick and I (Vicky Chen) met 3 years ago at New York University Tisch asia, school of the arts in Singapore. He is a teacher while I worked closely with NYU as an actor on multiple short films.
Coming from Manhattan New York, Patrick was used to film screenings at bars and wanted to bring this casual, fun and creative spirit to Singapore. So, while having a beer and chips at Emerald Hill, we came up with Cartoons Underground.
Being a local, I had the contacts who helped to make this event happen while Patrick knew animators who wanted to showcase their work. 
Patrick Smith is an international award-winning animator from New York. Currently, he teaches animation at  New York University Tisch Asia of the Arts in Singapore.
His directorial debut was for the Emmy-nominated series Down-Town, continuing on to direct the popular animated series Daria. Since then he has directed a handful of short films which earned him much reputation at film festivals worldwide as well as numerous awards. Besides those short films Smith creates commercials as well as pieces of installation art, sometimes published as street art (and eventually stolen).
The co-founder of www.Scribbledjunkes.blogspot.com with Bill Plympton, you may read more about his art, inspirations, travel and writing. 
Vicky Chen is an undergraduate studying business at SMU. She spends her time reading comics, traveling and painting. The owner of Chromaki, an online boutique that sells mainly, vintage clothing.

Other Ways You Can Help
We need PHOTOGRAPHERS, animators, artists and VOLUNTEERS!
Please contact us at cartoonsunderground@gmail.com if you're interested.
Risk and Challenges
Being the first underground animation festival in a totally informal setting, the most essential part is getting the right crowd and media to cover the event.How to ensure the right crowd and media coverage, you ask?
Luckily, we have Patrick Smith onboard, who has gotten the permission from different animators to showcase the shorts for free. Also, he has the experience of organising and being part of multiple famous international film festivals. For the past 3 years, he has organised the annual Scribble Junkies animation event in America that showcased 2D animation shorts. Every year, Scribble Junkies animation event drew in a large crowd with hundreds of animators sending in their 2d works to be screened during the event.
However, this is located in Singapore and the art community here is small. Although this may facilitate the dispersion of information, it might mean that we have a smaller turnout. In regard to overcoming the challenge, we have to expand the invitation to anyone who may be interested.
Being a local, I was the executive head of marketing at Singapore Management University's largest community service event, StarringSMU in 2011. StarringSMU involved 10 000 members of the public and 3000 students. Between 2005 - 2008, I worked as a runner for events at clubs such as Zouk, selling tickets. This gave me the opportunity to connect with club owners, event organisations and influencers. I was able to use my experience and network to not only gather the help and promote the event to the general public but also in securing the venue for the event.
Also, C.U is passed around by word of mouth, social media (Facebook,Blog & Youtube for trailers, updates and artists backgrounds etc) and posters and postcards that are placed in schools, creative organisations and shops.
The timeline is very compressed for this project, there are potentials for delays at every stage from logo designing to the equipment procurement. Also malfunction of the core equipment such as the projection screen need to be taken into consideration.
This is being mitigated by having substitutes for core equipments and additional staff available to help with the creative design and distribution of posters. This will ensure that the public receives the information concerning C.U. in a timely manner but also that the actual event takes place without a hitch.
We have Home Club that has invited different bloggers/magazines/publishers to cover the event.
Our long term goal is to make this an annual event. The success and popularity of this event on the 29th of November 2012 will determine future sponsors and potential funding to make it even BIGGER and BETTER in 2013.
We hope to fly animators from all over the world to attend this event in 2013 and to have a bigger social media campaign next year to involve more artists. In 2013, the festival could become, well, a proper festival and span over a few days with life drawing sessions etc.
Delivery of rewards
We have printed all posters and postcards.Also, we have obtained a popcorn stand, so don't worry! You'll definitely get your popcorn.
Sketches and Portraits delivered on the 25th of December 2012:
We have a strong team of 6 artists who will deliver your rewards directly to me on the 10th of December 2012, this would give us 15 days for delivery. Also, there are 4 other artists on standby who take over if necessary.
Most of the artists will be having their holiday in December thus freeing up time to spend on executing beautiful sketches and/or portraits of you or your loved one.

Our Story / Notre histoire

 
The Centre for Services in Restorative Justice (CSJR) is a non-profit organization, created in 2001. We deal with the impact of criminal acts in the lives of those who have either committed or suffered from a crime. April 25 to 30, 2012, will be the third edition of our Montreal-based exhibition by, for and with victims of criminal acts:  Art for freedom : a life after crime.  The project was initiated by victims who had experienced how creativity had helped them deal with their trauma. 
 
Le Centre de services de justice réparatrice (CSJR) est un organisme a but non lucratif, créé en 2001. Sa mission est de s'intéresser aux conséquences d'un acte criminel dans la vie des personnes qui l'ont commis ou subi. Du 25 au 30 avril 2012, nous allons organiser  àMontréal, la troisiéme édition de notre exposition par, pour et avec les victimes d'actes criminels : L'Art Libérateur, Vivre après le Crime. Ce projet est venu de personnes victimes qui ont découvert à quel point la créativité les a aidées à se libérer de leurs traumatismes. 
 
 


The Impact / L'impact

The exhibition is designed as a space of free expression. Exhibitors are allowed to show where they are at, in their lives, and in the process of recovering their own voice. It is also a way of not only doing away with the guilt that afflicts many victims of crime but also of removing the social stigma and giving them a way to regain their place within their community. Finally, the exhibition helps the general public know more about what being a victim of crime can imply, away from all the stereotypes. 
L'exposition est conçue comme un espace d'expression. Les exposants ont la liberté de montrer ou ils sont rendus dans leur vie et dans le processus leur permettant de retrouver leur voix. C'est aussi une manière de se débarasser de la culpabilité qui afflige beaucoup de victimes d'actes criminels et aussi du stigmatisme social, en leur offrant un moyen de se réintégrer au sein de leur communauté. Finalement, l'exposition permet au grand public d'en apprendre plus sur la réalité des victimes d'actes criminels, en se défaisant de tous les stéréotypes. 
 


We Need... & You Get../ Nous avons besoin de...& vous obtenez...

In order to give more of a voice to the wonderful artworks that are being shown each year, we have decided to publish a magazine for the exhibition that will feature all the artwork being displayed, along with the personal stories or creative writing pieces of the exhibitors. There will also be articles written by members of the organization and interviews with key players in the restorative justice world. We need to pay for the design and the printing of this magazine.Depending on your contribution, you will get our most sincere thanks, smaller of bigger prints of your favourite artwork, a magazine and even a limited print edition of ""Colline vue d'une colline"" by Guy Laramée.

<h3>A Remedy for a Constitutional Crisis</h3>
<p>After the 2016 election, I like many Americans, felt the urge to protest. Yet protest in and of itself felt futile. I wanted action. When discussing the election with some of my students at The New School, one of them revealed she had never read the U.S. Constitution and I realized, I had not either, at least never fully. Coincidentally I heard an interview with Burt Neuborne, Professor of Civil Liberties at NYU Law School about his book <i>Madison’s Music</i>. In the book Neuborne states that the first amendment can be read as poetry, and he challenges the literal or originalist interpretation of the document.</p>
<p>After listening to the interview, I thought what a better way to embodying the laws, freedoms (and mistakes) outlined in our nation’s founding document then by reading it out loud as a community. Thus, <i>A Remedy for a Constitutional Crisis</i> was born.</p>
</div><div>
<h3><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">The Event</span></h3>
<p><i>A Remedy for a Constitutional Crisis </i>is an eight-hour celebratory reading of the United States Constitution. This event is free to the public and will occur in the outdoor amphitheater at Abrons Art Center on September 17, 2017 (Constitution Day) from 12pm-8pm.</p>
<p>During this event, the U.S. Constitution will be read in multiple languages by multiple performers. In addition to the reading, there will be breakout groups for concepts discussions on topics such as, the separation of powers, Federalism and individual rights and as well as an area for participatory writing where attendees may copy portions of the U.S. Constitution or interpret it in their own words.</p>
<p>Artist<strong> Rosemary Taylor</strong> is creating banners which visually interpret specific amendments. These will hang from the balconies that surround the amphitheater. Food and drink will be available throughout the day for attendees and participants alike. </p>

<p>This is project is created in collaboration with <strong>Clarinda Mac Low, George Emilio Sanchez</strong> and <strong>Rosemary Taylor</strong>. Check out their bios below!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The funds received from your generous contributions will assist in the purchase of materials for the participatory writing element as well as for artist supplies to create the banners. Additionally your support will allow the event to be professionally documented. This documentation is essential for future grant applications and reproductions of this project.</p>
<p>During a time when so many people are disaffected by our political system,<i> A Remedy for a Constitutional Crisis</i> offers a way to form an intimate connection with our founding document and a platform to celebrate and reconnect with our rights as citizens. This is not a project that views its subject with a singular political lens. I envision replicating it all over the country especially in communities with diverse political points of view. Perhaps this is one way forward to healing the toxic divisions that plague our nation. Your support will allow me to take the initial step to achieve this goal by presenting and documenting a fully realized production. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p><i>A Remedy for a Constitutional Crisis</i> will be created and performed regardless if it is successfully funded. However, if it is not funded I will not be able to professionally document the work which in turn may prevent this project from reaching a wider audience.</p>
<p>If this campaign is fully funded I will be able to afford a two-camera documentation set up and live stream of the event.</p>
<p>If I raise $1500 I will be able to pay my collaborators and performers a modest honorarium.</p>
<p>If I raise $2000 I will be able to pay a professional photographer to document the event.</p>
<p>All of your contributions allow for this work to be more fully realized.</p>
<p>Thank you for your support!</p>

This is project is created in collaboration with Clarinda Mac Low, George Emilio Sanchez and Rosemary Taylor. Check out their bios below!

The Impact
The funds received from your generous contributions will assist in the purchase of materials for the participatory writing element as well as for artist supplies to create the banners. Additionally your support will allow the event to be professionally documented. This documentation is essential for future grant applications and reproductions of this project.
During a time when so many people are disaffected by our political system, A Remedy for a Constitutional Crisis offers a way to form an intimate connection with our founding document and a platform to celebrate and reconnect with our rights as citizens. This is not a project that views its subject with a singular political lens. I envision replicating it all over the country especially in communities with diverse political points of view. Perhaps this is one way forward to healing the toxic divisions that plague our nation. Your support will allow me to take the initial step to achieve this goal by presenting and documenting a fully realized production. 

Risks & Challenges
A Remedy for a Constitutional Crisis will be created and performed regardless if it is successfully funded. However, if it is not funded I will not be able to professionally document the work which in turn may prevent this project from reaching a wider audience.
If this campaign is fully funded I will be able to afford a two-camera documentation set up and live stream of the event.
If I raise $1500 I will be able to pay my collaborators and performers a modest honorarium.
If I raise $2000 I will be able to pay a professional photographer to document the event.
All of your contributions allow for this work to be more fully realized.
Thank you for your support!

Who’s Involved
Maya Ciarrocchi is a New York City based interdisciplinary artist whose work addresses identity, outsiderness and the body as a site of history. Her focus is on unseen and underrepresented populations including communities living in the coal fields of Appalachia, formerly ultra-Orthodox Jews, and Trans* and gender non-conforming people.

<p>Здравейте. Аз съм Петя Стойкова - хореограф и влюбен в танца човек, търсещ възможности да реализира творчеството си. Основател съм на Танцова компания ""Дюн"", която се стреми да съществува в Бургас, въпреки недостатъчното финансиране и липса на ресурси извън столицата. Занимавам се с танц от дете, защото това е детската ми мечта. Сега съм професионален хореограф и преподавател - съвременен танц. Можете да видите части от моите представления тук: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skgUIBgmBpk"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skgUIBgmBpk</a>      и тук: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AagbNpf9CL8"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AagbNpf9CL8</a><br/></p>
<p>Да бъдеш независим артист в България е изключително трудно. Това означава да осигуряваш сам средствата за своята артистична работа. Не мога да си представя какво бих правила без танцуването. Това е моята светлина и енергия. <br/></p>
<p>Съществуването на танц извън центъра е каузата за която имам нужда от 
вашата подкрепа. Компания ""Дюн"", която аз се опитвам да развивам тук е 
единствената независима трупа за съвременен танц и танцов театър извън 
столицата. Ако танцът е на изчезване в изкуството, то това е още 
по-силно изразено в градовете, които не са София, Лондон, Париж и Берлин. <br/></p>
<p>Танцът е на изчезване. Също като пчеличките.... <br/></p>
<p>В момента реализирам проект, наречен ""Танцов театър в Бургас"", защото много бих искала това да съществува именно тук - в Бургас. Моят град. В проектът ми е включен спектакъл с участието на 12 прекрасни, талантливи танцьори. <br/></p>

<p>Hello. My name is Petya Stoykova -
choreographer and a person deeply in love with Dance, founder of “Dune
Dance Company” in Bulgaria.</p>
<p>In Bulgaria almost everything is
happening at the capital city, especially in the field of contemporary dance.
Dune company is the only dance troupe and production company for contemporary
dance and dance theater that exists and survives out of the capital, raising
its own finances from teaching and partially from art projects.  </p>
<p>In my work I am fulfilling my
childhood dream. Dance is light and energy for me.</p>
<p>You can see parts of my performances
here : <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skgUIBgmBpk"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skgUIBgmBpk</span></a>  and here: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AagbNpf9CL8"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AagbNpf9CL8</span></a></p>
<p>Being independent artist in Bulgaria
is extremely hard. It means that you have to find money on your own for your
artistic work. Sometimes you are taking a loan to create a piece, another time
you work commercial stuffs to support your dreams.  </p>
<p>The cause I am asking you to support
is <b>the existing of the dance out of the central cities. </b> Dance is now
vanishing from the art in general. And this is even more visible in cities that
are not capitals like Sofia, Paris or Berlin...<span> 
Dance is vanishing. Like the bees. </span></p>
<p>Now I work on a larger project
""Dance theater in Burgas"" where 12 talented dancers will create and
perform a piece called ""I WISH"".</p>
<p>""I WISH"" it's a one hour
performance about the Soul traveling to the material world. </p>
<p>Here is the text in our program:</p>
<p><i>They say the Soul we belong to
is divided in 12 pieces.The man is individual spark. 1/12 part of the Soul
energy.</i></p>
<p><i>They also say that the thought,
the wish, is an energy that creates matter. The world we living to is an
incarnation of each 1/12. The wishes creates the reality.</i></p>
<p><i>Look inward.</i></p>
<p>The performance is partially
supported by the Burgas municipality. But we still need funding for creating
the theatrical lights for the performance /around 600 euro for 2 performances/,
costumes /350 euro/ and decoration of the stage /300 euro/</p>
<p>The performance will be presented in
audience with tickets from 5 and 7 leva / aprox. 3-4 euro/. Contemporary dance
is not commercial in Bulgaria and this is the acceptable price for Burgas that
could bring audience in the theater for a performance with no well-known names
in it. The income from the performances will be used for covering the payments
for the dancers, also traveling and accommodation. If anything remains, it will
be used for presentations of the performance in other cities. <i>The first performance in Burgas will be at 13 November, 2014=<br/></i></p><p><i>If you decide
to support""I WISH"" you can have an official invitation for the Burgas
performances.  If you want to support this cause, but you don't have the

<p>Because our
company primaraly revolves around producing wall decorations and decorating the
interior, we always strived to create special and unique products. That's why
we fabricated something completely new based on decoring the interior. <b>The
Michelangelo 3D Wall Art Panels are an alternative to the industrialy produced
3D panels</b> which are produced using a single blueprint and in reality don't
have any artistic value. We produce panels by request exactly by measure. An
example would be if a wall we wanted to place the panel on were to be 4m in width and in height 2,5m. </p>We would
produce 4 panels with the height of 2,5m and the width of 1 m which can be
placed on the wall and without any cutouts and waste. 

<p>When they

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/><br/><h1>     The goal of our campaign:</h1>
<br/>The goal of our campaign is to raise $20,000 dollars to achieve 
serial production of 3D Wall Art Panels. We need AutoCAD software to 
make designing our new products and shapes easier. Aswell as that, we 
require a special CNC foam cutting machine. As of now, we pushed two 
basic lines of panels; COLORADO - inspired by the Grand Canyon, and 
ADRIA - inspired by the Adriatic sea.<br/><b>We have an abundance of new 
ideas for textures, for example the texture of ice, inspired by the blue
 polar ice, aswell as the texture of tree bark and many others! </b><br/><br/>By 
purchasing the software and the machine, we would upgrade and increase 
the capacity of our production and push new lines of 3D panels on the 
market.<br/> Along with using the CNC machines, in every product we add 
lots of love and the finishing touch of a hand that makes each product 
unique and gives it an artistic value, in the spirit of our company name
 Michelangelo. <br/>
<p>Until now, people show enthusiasm towards our project, and we recieved excellent recommendations.</p>
<p><b>We
 have $20,000 of our own money and we need to raise another $20,000 to 
acomplish the goal of our project !  </b><br/></p>

<h3><i>We unusually love what we do !  
</i></h3>
<p><b>Therefore, we ask you to help  us to start production of 
Michelangelo 3D Wall Art panels, and to be able to compete with large 
companies !  No one puts in as much soul in their work as we do!</b></p>
<p>We can ship the products anywhere around the globe. Just sends us a picture of the wall it would be placed on and the size/dimensions. We design it by measure and we ship it, and you yourself or a local worker can easily set it up. Every shipment comes with a signature of the artist.<b><br/></b></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Even if you cannot help us financially, we would be thankful of any 
spread word, to family, friends, colleagues, designers and would ask to 
introduce them to our campaign. We prepared nifty perks, so take a look 
at the pictures below.</p>

Our project - 3D Wall Art 



Because our
company primaraly revolves around producing wall decorations and decorating the
interior, we always strived to create special and unique products. That's why
we fabricated something completely new based on decoring the interior. The
Michelangelo 3D Wall Art Panels are an alternative to the industrialy produced
3D panels which are produced using a single blueprint and in reality don't
have any artistic value. We produce panels by request exactly by measure. An
example would be if a wall we wanted to place the panel on were to be 4m in width and in height 2,5m. We would
produce 4 panels with the height of 2,5m and the width of 1 m which can be
placed on the wall and without any cutouts and waste. 

When they
are placed, they form a unit.

                              1.                                                          2.

   
                                                                             3.      
               .                                                                                                                                             


                              4. Panels
are placed and painted !    


                                              It is unique and looks fabulous  
                                COLORADO 3D  Wall  Art -  on living romm wall
      
                               For each project , we issue the signature of the artist.     
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------     The goal of our campaign:
The goal of our campaign is to raise $20,000 dollars to achieve 
serial production of 3D Wall Art Panels. We need AutoCAD software to 
make designing our new products and shapes easier. Aswell as that, we 
require a special CNC foam cutting machine. As of now, we pushed two 
basic lines of panels; COLORADO - inspired by the Grand Canyon, and 
ADRIA - inspired by the Adriatic sea.We have an abundance of new 
ideas for textures, for example the texture of ice, inspired by the blue
 polar ice, aswell as the texture of tree bark and many others! By 
purchasing the software and the machine, we would upgrade and increase 
the capacity of our production and push new lines of 3D panels on the 
market. Along with using the CNC machines, in every product we add 
lots of love and the finishing touch of a hand that makes each product 
unique and gives it an artistic value, in the spirit of our company name
 Michelangelo. 
Until now, people show enthusiasm towards our project, and we recieved excellent recommendations.
We
 have $20,000 of our own money and we need to raise another $20,000 to 
acomplish the goal of our project !  
AutoCADSoftware....................$10 000CNC foamcutter machine.......$30 000                                   




We unusually love what we do !  

Therefore, we ask you to help  us to start production of 
Michelangelo 3D Wall Art panels, and to be able to compete with large 
companies !  No one puts in as much soul in their work as we do!
We can ship the products anywhere around the globe. Just sends us a picture of the wall it would be placed on and the size/dimensions. We design it by measure and we ship it, and you yourself or a local worker can easily set it up. Every shipment comes with a signature of the artist.

Even if you cannot help us financially, we would be thankful of any 
spread word, to family, friends, colleagues, designers and would ask to 
introduce them to our campaign. We prepared nifty perks, so take a look 
at the pictures below.

                        Panel thickness is from 3cm to 10 cm or moree ! 
                                 The waves are always different shape.                                                            



We would like to invite architects and interior designers for co-operative bussines.  We (together) can produce unique projects and decorative elements for the interior.  www.michelangelo-art.net

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------    Michelangelo 3D Panels can be used as a standalone decorative element on the  wall, like a frame of a bigger landscape-art.           


                  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We specialize in producing such decorative panels/tablets which appear in a similar fashion not unlike real carved stone, We produce by request, and add names of family members, personal names, last-names, company, shop and office titles/names and more depending on the request. The final product is always unique and fits the living room, above the fireplace, aswell in workplaces. Below is a panel (faux stone) with old-Croatian writing - Glagoljica written onto it, which was used 600 years before the discovery of America. These stone panels/tablets can be decorated with any font, wether it be Latin, Gothic writing, and so on...
Old Croatian writing GLAGOLJICA - Artificial stone, nifty house decoration.

Michelangelo 3D Walls look fantastic in comination with RGB LED lighting. As the colors of the light change, the look of the interior is drasticly changed. A special look is achieved when the light hits the tips of the prolonged wawy textures.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>We are Erin Canady (instagram: @erin.canady) and Michael Riesch (instagram: @cardboardcouch). We are artists, husband and wife, and the creators of SLOUCH tattoo &amp; art gallery. Erin is a fine artist and teaches at local colleges. Michael is a tattoo artist and illustrator. We have been making art our whole lives, and want to create a space that breaks down the barriers within our art worlds.</p>
<p>SLOUCH will be a place for all art to coexist. It will uplift and pay artists within the community. It will house an art retail space, a gallery with rotating exhibitions, and three private tattoo studios. The retail space will consist of locally sourced creative goods such as prints and functional ceramics. The gallery space will feature original works of art from artists near and far, giving priority to marginalized and under-represented artists. The private tattoo studios will be safe, welcoming, and unintimidating. Combining tattooing within the same space as contemporary exhibitions will help break down stereotypes the general public has when entering both a traditional gallery space and a traditional tattoo shop.</p>
<p>Contributing to our campaign will allow this unique creative space to come to life. Not only will it propel our business, but it will propel the representation of artists within our community and Western North Carolina at large. It will also help carve a niche for an important conversation about art that doesn't fully exist yet in the area.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We already have some funding. However, we need more! We need your help raising $10,000, which will go toward the cost of getting our space up and running. This includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>New walls, drywall, lighting, paint.</li>
<li>Initial stock on tattoo supplies (gloves, medical coverings, ink caps, plastic wrap, etc.)</li>
<li>Getting the retail space ready, which includes purchasing local art and buying furniture, display shelves, etc.</li>
<li>Initial payroll for our first employee.</li>
<li>Initial bills for the first month in the space, including rent, utilities, insurance, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Our main goals are to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make contemporary art accessible to the general public in both affordability and understanding.</li>
<li>Bridge the gap between appreciation of high-brow and low-brow art by housing them in the same space.</li>
<li>Uplift and pay artists in our community with priority to marginalized and under-represented artists.</li>
<li>Create a tattoo environment that feels safe, calming, and inclusive.</li>
<li>Build a space that champions all avenues of creativity while dissolving barriers surrounding traditional galleries and tattoo studios.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>SLOUCH will be located in a 1200 sq foot stand alone building in Weaverville, North Carolina. Most of our community and existing clientele is in Asheville, which is about 15 minutes south of Weaverville. This distance is both a challenge to our business and a potential benefit. We chose this location intentionally for the following reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>We hope it will help us span our reach to not only Asheville, but the surrounding cities that are less saturated with art but equally as deserving of it.</li>
<li>A lot of Ashevillians enjoy traveling to Weaverville because it is an escape from the bustle of tourism. Our space feels like a getaway. There is a beautiful view of the mountains from the front, and an outdoor gathering/event space. It is 3 minutes off of the on-ramp to I-26, yet in a setting that feels secluded and special.</li>
<li>Since we have an established tattoo clientele already, foot traffic is not important to us. Instead, we want to hold bi-monthly events to encourage new people to come out and bolster community involvement.</li>
</ol>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you can't contribute money, you can still help by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Spreading the word! Share our goal and campaign on social media, with your family &amp; friends.</li>
<li>Donating labor! Do you want to help us paint walls? Move furniture? Hang art? Let us know!</li>
<li>Donating supplies! Let us know if you have something you think a gallery or retail space could use.</li>
<li>Donate items that we can use as perks for our campaign backers (we're thinking art, prints, ceramics, experiences, etc).</li>

It is with tremendous gratitude and excitement that I share SOMArts’s inaugural performing arts festival and my curatorial debut with you!</p><p>The festival grounds itself in the theoretical framework articulated by Black lesbian feminist poet and activist Audre Lorde in her essay, “Uses of the Erotic: The Erotic As Power”, where she describes the erotic as a rigorous, liberatory practice where it is, “not a question of what we do alone, [but] a question of how acutely, how fully we can feel in the doing.” While the erotic can and does allude to sexualities, sensuality and touch, it is, within this context, a point of reference through which artists and audiences alike are invited to locate a well of deep-seated bodily wisdom through the sharing of performances, visual art, and workshops. While this festival certainly is about boldly envisioning the future we want for ourselves and our communities, it is also about dropping into the urgency of this very moment. What does liberation feel like in our bodies? How do we generate that feeling <strong>right now</strong>?</p><p>In my own experience as a social justice-oriented classical musician and through witnessing the physical, mental, and emotional toll that this work has on my colleagues, I have noticed the individual and collective pain that musicians and other artists in various fields carry in their day-to-day attempts at creating meaningful, satisfying, and liberatory art.  Through this festival, I aim to provide a creative space for participating artists and audiences to find liberation in their work by exploring the erotic in its many forms.</p><p><a href=""http://www.somarts.org/tellmewhatitfeelslike/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Check out the festival details here.</a></p><p> </p><p><strong><u>About SOMArts Cultural Center</u></strong></p><p>SOMArts leverages the power of art as a tool for social change through multi-disciplinary events and exhibitions. Equipping artists with the space, mentorship and support they need to shift perspectives and innovate solutions, SOMArts fosters access to arts and culture for collective liberation and self-determination.</p><p> </p><p><u><strong>What We Need &amp; The Impact of Your Support</strong></u></p><p>In combination with the amount awarded to this project from SOMArts Cultural Center, I am looking to raise an additional $1,500 to cover the cost of paying our artists for creating new works and generously sharing their resources directly with the community.</p><p>All monies raised will go directly to the 15 participating artists, most of whom are folks of color and identify along the spectrum of queer, trans and femme-of-center identities. In addition to recognizing artists for their labor and creative generosity, it is my goal to support artists who embody socio-economically marginalized identities.

It is with tremendous gratitude and excitement that I share SOMArts’s inaugural performing arts festival and my curatorial debut with you!The festival grounds itself in the theoretical framework articulated by Black lesbian feminist poet and activist Audre Lorde in her essay, “Uses of the Erotic: The Erotic As Power”, where she describes the erotic as a rigorous, liberatory practice where it is, “not a question of what we do alone, [but] a question of how acutely, how fully we can feel in the doing.” While the erotic can and does allude to sexualities, sensuality and touch, it is, within this context, a point of reference through which artists and audiences alike are invited to locate a well of deep-seated bodily wisdom through the sharing of performances, visual art, and workshops. While this festival certainly is about boldly envisioning the future we want for ourselves and our communities, it is also about dropping into the urgency of this very moment. What does liberation feel like in our bodies? How do we generate that feeling right now?In my own experience as a social justice-oriented classical musician and through witnessing the physical, mental, and emotional toll that this work has on my colleagues, I have noticed the individual and collective pain that musicians and other artists in various fields carry in their day-to-day attempts at creating meaningful, satisfying, and liberatory art.  Through this festival, I aim to provide a creative space for participating artists and audiences to find liberation in their work by exploring the erotic in its many forms.Check out the festival details here. About SOMArts Cultural CenterSOMArts leverages the power of art as a tool for social change through multi-disciplinary events and exhibitions. Equipping artists with the space, mentorship and support they need to shift perspectives and innovate solutions, SOMArts fosters access to arts and culture for collective liberation and self-determination. What We Need & The Impact of Your SupportIn combination with the amount awarded to this project from SOMArts Cultural Center, I am looking to raise an additional $1,500 to cover the cost of paying our artists for creating new works and generously sharing their resources directly with the community.All monies raised will go directly to the 15 participating artists, most of whom are folks of color and identify along the spectrum of queer, trans and femme-of-center identities. In addition to recognizing artists for their labor and creative generosity, it is my goal to support artists who embody socio-economically marginalized identities. As an artist and curator, I believe that we must call on the creativity, vision and skill of artists to build futures that we wish to be a part of, and I am devoted to amplifying the voices of those whose work and lives are deemed most precarious yet urgently necessary within our current social and political climate. Their voices have been and continue to be a crucial part of our community and movement-building, and your donation would go towards supporting and sustaining their work. Other Ways You Can HelpEven if you are not in a financial position to donate, there are other ways that you can support this fundraising effort and this festival. You can share this campaign on social media and your other networks and, of course, join us on May 4-6th at SOMArts Cultural Center. We hope to see you there! Text for VideoHi everyone!

<p>PEACE WE CAN will be a youth camp in the summer 2016.
It will consist of a range of activities, both artistic and thematic. The
setting for this first edition of PEACE WE CAN will be the Bosnian capital
Sarajevo. Youngsters from 5 different countries all around the Balkans will
gather for 10 days around their common passion, art in general and spray can
art in particular. There will be guest artists involved in delivering workshops
to the participants, in order to help them improve their artistic skills
ranging from sketching to actually spraying. Both individual and collective
murals will be created. Alongside of that, a number of contextual activities
around tolerance, peace and multiculturalism will be carried out by our

is to happen throughout this experience.</p>
<p>In terms of accommodation, we will be hosted by the
foundation “Land of friendship and peace” in Rakovica, Sarajevo. It was founded
shortly after the 1992-1995 war to organise activities for orphans of the

<p><b>Why is PEACE WE CAN important? </b></p>
<p>Spray Peace
believes it is about time to forget about our differences and underline what we
have in common and what brings us together. Even if 2015 marks 20 years of
peace in Bosnia, the aftermath of the rivalries in this region is still
noticeable. It is therefore crucial that now people get aware of the
inestimable value of peace and how vital it is to preserve it.  </p>
<p>To this day, there
are hate crimes being perpetrated throughout Bosnia. Those crimes are often
committed by young people and are discriminating against ethnicities and
religion. This creates a tense atmosphere amongst the communities which could
be avoided. It is exactly why we want to target those young people with this project.
PEACE WE CAN will give them an invaluable opportunity to meet people from other
cultures in a different and positive context.</p>
<p>This camp will have
several scopes of impact. First of all, it will act as non-formal education for
the participants, who will improve their social and team-work skills. They will
learn the benefits of diversity and spread the word of the importance of peace.
Moreover, it will have a positive impact on the local community; materially by
embellishing places and buildings that to this day bear traces of the fights
and psychologically by conveying a strong message of tolerance and respect.</p>

<p><b>Why is it worth your support and what will you

participation and play.  To gain access, you must solve the exterior puzzles and discover the password that allows entry.  Not in the mood for mysteries?  No worries, friend—the Black Rock Blind Tiger offers something for everyone, whether it’s a moment’s respite on the widow’s walk, or a secret gift found while exploring. Our team of artists and builders are fixing up and rebuilding parts of the structures.  We are making sure every little detail is taken care of in the interactive 1920s speakeasy for all Burning Man participants to experience and enjoy.  We’ll have interactive gifts, scintillating conversation, and excellent jazz music to keep you dancing the night away.  But the Black Rock Blind Tiger is more than just a speakeasy.  Join us and delight in the curious art, the unusual objects, and the many surprises that await you inside of the Black Rock Blind Tiger.  The InspirationThe Black Rock Blind Tiger is inspired by prohibition-era speakeasies, or secret drinking establishments that often required a password to gain entry.  Occasionally thirsty people skirted prohibition laws by acquiring “prescriptions” for “medicinal” drinks that were otherwise unlawful.  Sometimes these drinks were served through a secret drawer so that the identity of the server was never revealed. The name “Blind Tiger” itself is code for an illegal drinking establishment where the seller's identity was concealed. The TeamThe Black Rock Blind Tiger is based out of Austin, Texas and led by veteran Burning Man and Burning Flipside attendee Tiffaney Benson.  The team includes a 20+ person crew of artists, mixologists, builders, designers, and do’ers.  For more about our team, see our Team Bios page:  http://www.blackrockblindtiger.com/artist-and-t... FundingWe’re raising funds to bring The Black Rock Blind Tiger back to the playa for Burning Man 2017.  To date we have raised $3,000 through local fundraisers, but we have $4,000 remaining to meet our goal.  Our major expenses include building supplies, transportation, supplies for the speakeasy, gadgets and insurance.  The Black Rock Blind Tiger is a volunteer-led project supported entirely by our team members, fundraiser attendees, and Indiegogo campaign backers.  Your support of our campaign allows us to bring back our dream of a community speakeasy to the playa in 2017.   PerksStickers:For a $15 donation, get a cool Blind Tiger sticker to stick on all your things and a big thanks from us. Bandanas:For a $25 donation, get a handy cotton tiger stripe bandana with our logo to wipe away all that playa dust.   Blind Tiger Brothel Poster:For a $30 donation, get a super fun pin-up style poster from the Blind Tiger Brothel sign. Aluminum Logo Water Bottle or Stainless Steel Logo Flask:For a $40 donation, get your choice of an aluminum logo water bottle with a screw top and a carabiner, OR a 6 oz. stainless steel flask with a leather wrap and our logo on it!  T-shirts:For a $50 donation, get a t-shirt with our crew logo screen-printed on the front and the Burning Man closed prohibition sign on the back.  T-shirts are dark grey, crew neck, 50/50 ring spun combed cotton and polyester for softness and durability.  Available in either men's or women's sizes XS-3X. Women's t-shirt style:Men's t-shirt style: Hoodies:For a $75 donation, Get your own personalized clue with your name on The Speakeasy on the play and stay warm and get a hoodie with our crew logo screen-printed on the front and the Burning Man prohibition closed sign on the back.  Hoodies are dark grey and pull-over style in 50/50 cotton and poly fleece.  Sizes XS-3X.   Glasses:For a $100 donation, get 4 swanky glasses with our logo etched on them.  Glasses will have a copper, silver or gold dipped honeycomb design (handwash only).  Decanter + bar glasses:For a $200 donation, get both a decanter and a set of glasses with our logo etched onto them.  Decanter and glasses will have a copper, silver or gold dipped honeycomb design (handwash only).  Speakeasy Sunset Sail on Lake Travis:For $600 donation, enjoy a beautiful sunset sail on lake travis with 3 of your friends.  You will be sipping on cocktails with the wind blowing in your hair watching the sun melt into the horizon.  Delicious Hors d'oeuvres will be served with the fine cocktails. Other Ways to HelpIf you want to make a non-monetary donation, contact the Blind Tiger team at blackrockblindtiger@gmail.com.  We are in need of vintage furniture and knick-knacks, building supplies, gas and grocery gift cards, alcohol, and many other things! Learn Morehttp://www.blackrockblindtiger.com/https://www.facebook.com/blackrockblindtiger/ Thanks:Thank you Dust To Ashes for the Amazing Bathtub Brothel photo.  See more amazing photos at www.dusttoashes.com.",11.0,0,"3 Campaigns

<p>It's Fall, 2014, and we're still kicking and screaming and shifting and moving here in the Bay Area. There's so much good and there's so much bad and WE NEED YOUR HELP.</p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> Here's the work:</span></p>
<p>In our ongoing quest to haul the arts out from its often-strangled position in our economy, we're honing in on the task of changing the actual dominant systems of value around art. These dominant<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> systems ensure that artists remain in constant servitude to wealth and for-profit projects, that we are casually reaped for our creations and cultural contributions, and that we are made to constantly assess our worth in terms of competitive and anti-art deliverables that place us in a fictitious, endless funding-seeking infrastructure that only wants to keep us utterly marginalized. We're pissed, we're buzzing, we're tired, but we're not dead yet, so...</span></p>
<p>One strategy that we're leaning into heavily right now is the act of elevating PRACTICE:</p>
<p>So…how do we insist on the value of our practices, which are arguably the bones, muscles and blood of our lives as artists; the actions that last long before and after our ""pieces"" are done, our funding is dry, and our careers have been made socio-economically impossible? Can we redefine what art operates as, by veering our critical attention away from the art object or ""piece"", and instead inviting audiences into our work and creating experiences and sensations that are INCLUSIVE of our actual practices of being artists? Shouldn't we be dismantling the notion that artists are people who produce things, inside of capitalism, for other people to experience or have, and instead be expanding the reality that artists are actually people whose personal and creative practices are rigorous locations for imagining change? Shouldn't  creative practice be an expanded concept that more people can identify themselves in? Let's rally around practice, look at it closely, let it compose our reality, honor it obsessively, and allow it to give us connectivity, catharsis, and criticality.</p>
<p>For the week of November 10th-16th, we are programming ALL THE PRACTICE, an entire week of action at Z Space in San Francisco, all dedicated to making art, conversations, and happenings that will elevate PRACTICE. We are inviting YOU and an army of rigorous artists practicing in and around forms of dance and performance to gather, practice, watch each other practice, learn each other's practices, practice seeing the practice in places where we might not usually look for it, talk about new ideas for funding/resources/support, listen to our elders, and take stock of what it is to lead of life of practice. Also, this is a week to think and feel critically about what a ""practice"" really is, and how when we have one, we really do have SO MUCH. We are the art, people..and lord knows, we must not allow ourselves to be bought and sold so easily. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Here's the schedule!</p>
<p>-Tuesday Nov. 11th, 7:30pm: Dance Discourse Project #20: ALL THE PRACTICE with guest panelists: Margy Jenkins, Brontez Purnell, Nina Haft, Dia Dear, and Sara Shelton Mann</p>
<p>-Wednesday Nov. 12th, 8pm: 100 REASONS TO LIVE:  a night of many many many experiential offerings from each of us to each of you. </p>
<p>-Thursday Nov. 13th, times TBA: OPEN SPACE for practice sharing and conversation</p>
<p>-Friday Nov. 14th, 8pm:  THE PRACTICE SHOW: parallel experiments and studies, with Amara Tabor-Smith, Maria Francesca Scaroni, Jassem Hindi, Tove Sahlin, Monique Jenkinson, Annie Danger, Tossie Long, Marina Fukishima, Daiane Lopes Da Silva, Larry Arrington, Allie Hankins, Keyon Gaskin, Brontez Purnell, and Abby Crain</p>
<p>-Saturday Nov. 15th, 8pm: 2 new works/practices, ""WE"" by Larry Arrington, and ""just in the yard""  by Jesse Hewit<br/></p>
<p>-Sunday Nov. 16th, 8pm: 2 new works/practices, ""WE"" by Larry Arrington, and ""just in the yard"" by Jesse Hewit</p> </div> <div> <h3>We need $4,000 to pay the league of incredible artists of this week!</h3> <p>The break down is this:</p> <ul>
<li>We have roughly 25 guest artists working in various capacities throughout the week, and we need to be able to give them each honorariums for their contributions.</li> <li>We are enthusiastically working in tandem with Z Space to present this week of programming, and we are working from a small amount of grant money to cover basic costs, but we still need to PAY OURSELVES for the many months of practice, organizing, administering, and art-making that is going into this week.</li> <li>AND…we MUST meet our entire goal of $4,000 or we get NONE! whoa! Jesse has NEVER done a crowd-funding campaign before and Larry's only done one, so we're banking on our novice status and ""alternative"" charms.</li>

</div></div>","GOOD FOLKS. Jesse and Larry here. 
It's Fall, 2014, and we're still kicking and screaming and shifting and moving here in the Bay Area. There's so much good and there's so much bad and WE NEED YOUR HELP.
 Here's the work:
In our ongoing quest to haul the arts out from its often-strangled position in our economy, we're honing in on the task of changing the actual dominant systems of value around art. These dominant systems ensure that artists remain in constant servitude to wealth and for-profit projects, that we are casually reaped for our creations and cultural contributions, and that we are made to constantly assess our worth in terms of competitive and anti-art deliverables that place us in a fictitious, endless funding-seeking infrastructure that only wants to keep us utterly marginalized. We're pissed, we're buzzing, we're tired, but we're not dead yet, so...
One strategy that we're leaning into heavily right now is the act of elevating PRACTICE:
So…how do we insist on the value of our practices, which are arguably the bones, muscles and blood of our lives as artists; the actions that last long before and after our ""pieces"" are done, our funding is dry, and our careers have been made socio-economically impossible? Can we redefine what art operates as, by veering our critical attention away from the art object or ""piece"", and instead inviting audiences into our work and creating experiences and sensations that are INCLUSIVE of our actual practices of being artists? Shouldn't we be dismantling the notion that artists are people who produce things, inside of capitalism, for other people to experience or have, and instead be expanding the reality that artists are actually people whose personal and creative practices are rigorous locations for imagining change? Shouldn't  creative practice be an expanded concept that more people can identify themselves in? Let's rally around practice, look at it closely, let it compose our reality, honor it obsessively, and allow it to give us connectivity, catharsis, and criticality.
For the week of November 10th-16th, we are programming ALL THE PRACTICE, an entire week of action at Z Space in San Francisco, all dedicated to making art, conversations, and happenings that will elevate PRACTICE. We are inviting YOU and an army of rigorous artists practicing in and around forms of dance and performance to gather, practice, watch each other practice, learn each other's practices, practice seeing the practice in places where we might not usually look for it, talk about new ideas for funding/resources/support, listen to our elders, and take stock of what it is to lead of life of practice. Also, this is a week to think and feel critically about what a ""practice"" really is, and how when we have one, we really do have SO MUCH. We are the art, people..and lord knows, we must not allow ourselves to be bought and sold so easily. 

Here's the schedule!
-Tuesday Nov. 11th, 7:30pm: Dance Discourse Project #20: ALL THE PRACTICE with guest panelists: Margy Jenkins, Brontez Purnell, Nina Haft, Dia Dear, and Sara Shelton Mann
-Wednesday Nov. 12th, 8pm: 100 REASONS TO LIVE:  a night of many many many experiential offerings from each of us to each of you. 
-Thursday Nov. 13th, times TBA: OPEN SPACE for practice sharing and conversation
-Friday Nov. 14th, 8pm:  THE PRACTICE SHOW: parallel experiments and studies, with Amara Tabor-Smith, Maria Francesca Scaroni, Jassem Hindi, Tove Sahlin, Monique Jenkinson, Annie Danger, Tossie Long, Marina Fukishima, Daiane Lopes Da Silva, Larry Arrington, Allie Hankins, Keyon Gaskin, Brontez Purnell, and Abby Crain
-Saturday Nov. 15th, 8pm: 2 new works/practices, ""WE"" by Larry Arrington, and ""just in the yard""  by Jesse Hewit
-Sunday Nov. 16th, 8pm: 2 new works/practices, ""WE"" by Larry Arrington, and ""just in the yard"" by Jesse Hewit   We need $4,000 to pay the league of incredible artists of this week! The break down is this: 
We have roughly 25 guest artists working in various capacities throughout the week, and we need to be able to give them each honorariums for their contributions. We are enthusiastically working in tandem with Z Space to present this week of programming, and we are working from a small amount of grant money to cover basic costs, but we still need to PAY OURSELVES for the many months of practice, organizing, administering, and art-making that is going into this week. AND…we MUST meet our entire goal of $4,000 or we get NONE! whoa! Jesse has NEVER done a crowd-funding campaign before and Larry's only done one, so we're banking on our novice status and ""alternative"" charms.

  ALSO: we know that money is SUPER WEIRD... …and some people just can't contribute. This economy is a truly overwhelming maze of a thing, and we know how lost people can feel inside of it. If you can't help out with a little money, please know that we really feel you and like you, and we'll still throw you twenty bucks when you need it. WE FIGHT THE SCARCITY BY PRACTICING ABUNDANCE.

<h3>Introduction<br/>
</h3>
<div>
<span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">I am a performance artist and musician based in London. <br/>My current work draws inspiration from rituals, especially those from ancient cultures, as a way to bring the public back into connection with themselves and their roots. In our modern city life we often move at such a fast pace we lose touch with ourselves and with each other. My art works attempt to slow the public down and bring about a deeply meditative experience in which they can connect more deeply to themselves and others. Through my collaboration with Marina Abramovic in 2014 I also saw how important this direction is in art and how strongly it affects the public.</span><br/>
</div>
<p> In July 2015 I was invited for a month-long residency at London's prestigious Barbican Centre. There I presented two new works, 'Ancestors' based on the ancient rituals and meditative music of my Lithuanian roots with Lithuanian folk singers 'Trys Keturiose'.<br/></p>
<p>Now I am seeking to go even deeper into this type of research, this time working with Buryat shamans in Lake Baikal, Russia. <br/></p>
<h3>
<b>Short summary</b><br/>
</h3>
<p>Siberian shamanism is one of the oldest traditions in the world, deeply connected to nature and to its roots and ancestors. From my research on these rich traditions and the incredible natural beauty of Lake Baikal and sacred places in Buryatia (mountains, volcanoes, rivers), I will create a new series of performances as well as a video installation together with artist <a href=""http://konstantinguz.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Konstantin Guz</a> which will show in a two-week solo exhibition at Fabrika Centre for Creative Industries in Moscow, October 2016.                
</p>
<p>Konstantin Guz is a
visual artist and photographer based in Amsterdam. His work crosses interdisciplinary boundaries and explores the medium of
photography and moving image in all its depths and facets.<br/></p>
<p>We also have plans to bring this exhibition on tour to the UK, USA, Netherlands, and other European countries. <br/></p>
<h3>Motivation <br/>
</h3>
<p>I want to learn from Shamans about the traditions of the Buryat people and their connection with ancestors and traditions which go back thousands of years. <br/></p>
<p>This project is extremely valuable to my artistic development, and I 
believe that through my experiences in Buryatia and work with shamans I 
will be even better able to approach my audiences and transform both 
myself and the public's emotional state through performance.  <br/></p>
<h3>Inspiration<br/>
</h3>
<p>Shamanism is an ancient tradition, Siberian shamanism being one of the oldest religions, which involves a person (shaman) entering into a trance-like state through music, dance, and song, during which he or she can communicate with the spirits of dead ancestors and nature, in order to bring harmony and balance to our lives on earth.  What interests me so much is their connection and respect for their ancestral traditions, as well as nature. In Buryatia, there are many fascinating natural sites sacred to shamanism, which we will visit and will be an integral part of our video work. One, for example is the island of Olkhon, in Lake Baikal, which has many special places, for example the Shaman's Rock: </p>
<p></p>
<p>'One of the most mysterious of the Baikal sites. It is on Cape Burkhan, earlier called the ""Stone Temple."" It is comprised of white marble, granite and quartz. The first explorers to reach Lake Baikal – including the Russian scientist Vladimir Obruchev – noted that Baikal Buryats traditionally feared this site. Only shamans had the right to approach this forbidden place. If it couldn't be avoided, horses' hoofs were wrapped in felt and leather so they did not disturb the lord of Baikal.</p>
<p>Buryats believed that Azhin (Buryat for deity), the lord of Lake Baikal, lived in the cave at Shaman Rock. According to the testimony of villagers who lived at Khunzhir, located near Cape Burkhan, the cave was visited by shamans that settled in ancient Siberia. Pagan priests still perform rituals in the cave associated with cleansing ancestral karma and removing curses.'-A Traveller's guide to Siberia<span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;""> </span></p>

<h3>What We Need<br/>
</h3> <p>I have generously received some funding from the EU Cultural Foundation to cover my own flight costs to Siberia, but in order to realize this project I need your support.</p> <ul> <li>In addition to myself, I have invited visual artist, Konstantin Guz, to film and photograph during our travels in Buryatia. I will need funds to pay :</li>
</ul>- artist fee to Konstantin;<br/>- his travel expenses and flights (from his city of origin to Buryatia) <br/>- hotels and accommodation for both of us while traveling and food. <br/>You find more about him and his work here:<ul>
<a href=""http://konstantinguz.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://konstantinguz.com</a><br/><br/>
<li>During our travels in Buryatia and Baikal we will need to hire an experienced guide in order to travel safely and explore the remote mountains and islands of Lake Baikal. </li>
<li>I will also need support to cover my internal travel costs (accommodation and land-transport) in Buryatia.</li>
<li>Cost of renting the equipment for filming and editing films.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
</ul>
<h3><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Perks: Depending on donation </span></h3>
<ul>
<li><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Donators will be listed as exhibition sponsors at Fabrika CCI, as well as all future exhibitions related with this funding project. </span></li>
<li>You will also be gifted with high-quality photographs, field recordings, posters, and film of our travels in spectacularly beautiful mountains and forests of Buryatia, Lake Baikal and its islands, as well as other places considered sacred to Buryat shamanism. </li>
<li>Highest giving donors will be gifted with photographs as well as limited-edition footage from the video made in Buryatia, and video artworks for private home screening.</li> </ul>

<br/>
</div> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>I strongly believe that in the 21st Century we are losing our roots - we are losing the rituals of our ancestors which keep us grounded and able to connect with the rhythms of life. We begin to forget that we ourselves, as pure human beings, have a deep strength and power that no technology can ever give. Through returning to older cultures and traditions, I create contemporary art works that seek to bring the public back into balance and harmony with themselves, contemplating their origins as well as bringing them to feel fully in the present moment. </p>
<ul> </ul>During this project ""Lake of Sacred Souls: Journey to Baikal"" I will keep an online journal via Facebook page and Instagram updating with news, photos of the journey and sharing fascinating facts about that region. <br/><br/>

<h3>Where the project will be shown?</h3>
<p>The premier of the project, performance and video installation, will be held at two-week solo exhibition at Fabrika CCI Gallery in Moscow, October 2016.

</p><p>­­­</p><p>Меня зовут Абраам Броди.</p><p>Я-перформер и
музыкант, живущий и работающий в Лондоне. Работая над текущим проектом, я
черпаю вдохновение из ритуалов, тех что берут свое начало в древних
культурах.<span>  Наша современная городская
жизнь бежит так быстро, что мы теряем связь и с самим собой, и с друг другом.  В основе моих арт работ лежит попытка
«замедления» публики, давая им возможность испытать глубокий медитативный опыт,
который даст им возможность соединиться с собой и другими. Благодаря моему
сотрудничеству с Мариной Абрамович в 2014 году я увидел как важно это
направление в искусстве и насколько сильно это влияет на публику.  <br/></span></p><p><span>
В июле 2015 года я был приглашен на месячную
резиденцию в престижном Barbican
Centre в Лондоне. Там я представил две новые работы «Предки»,
основанную на древних ритуалах и медитативной музыки моих литовских
корней.<span>  Сейчас я стремлюсь глубже исследовать
эту тему, на этот раз взаимодействуя с шаманами Бурятии на берегах озера
Байкал. </span></span></p><h3><span>Краткое содержание</span></h3>
Сибирский
шаманизм-одна из старейших в мире традиций, тесно связанная с природой и
почитающая свои корни и предков.<span> 
Основываясь на своем исследовании богатых традиций, невероятной
природной красоте озера Байкал и священных мест Бурятии, я создам новую серию
перформансов, а также видео инсталляцию совместно с современным визуальным художником <a href=""http://konstantinguz.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Константином Гузь</a>, которые
будут представлены на 2-х недельной соло выставке в </span>Центре
Творческих Индустрий ФАБРИКА,
Москва, осенью 2016 года. <br/>У нас также есть планы показа этой выставки в
Великобритании, США, Голландии и других европейских странах.
<br/><br/><h3>Мотивация</h3><p>
Я хочу получить знания шаманов о многовековых
традициях народа Бурятии и связях с их предками. 

Этот
проект является чрезвычайно ценным для моего творческого развития, и я считаю,
что через мой опыт в Бурятии и работе с шаманами я буду еще лучше
взаимодействовать с моей аудиторией и трансформировать себя и эмоциональное
состояние публики через перформанс. <br/></p><h3>Вдохновление</h3><p>
</p><p>Шаманизм-это
древняя традиция, а Сибирский шаманизм является одной из самых старых религий. Шаман-
человек, входящий в состояние транса через музыку и танец, в течение которого
он способен общаться с духами предков и природой. Что меня действительно
интересует, так это то уважение, которое они уделяют этим традициям. В Бурятии
большое количество интересных природных образований, являющихся священными
местами шаманов, которые я планирую посетить. Одно из них, гора Шаманка,
находится на острове Ольхон:</p>
<p>""Одно из
самых загадочных мест на Байкале. Оно находится на мысе Бурхан, ранее
называемый ""Каменный храм."" Состоит из белого мрамора, гранита и
кварца. Первые исследователи, добравшиеся до озера Байкал - в том числе
российский ученый Владимир Обручев - отметили, что буряты согласно традиции
боялись этого места. Только шаманы имели право подойти к этому запрещенному
месту. Если этой дороги не удавалось избежать, копыта лошадей заворачивали в
войлок и кожу, дабы не потревожить владыку Байкала.</p>
<p>Буряты считали,
что дух, владыка озера Байкал, жил в пещере горы Шаманка. По свидетельству
жителей села, которые жили в поселке Хунжир, расположенного недалеко от мыса
Бурхан, эту пещеру посещали шаманы, которые обосновались в древней Сибири.
Языческие жрецы по-прежнему выполняют в пещере ритуалы, связанные с очищением
родовой кармы и удаления проклятий.</p><h3>
<b>Что нам нужно и что получаете вы</b>
</h3><p>
</p><p>Я уже получил
грант от Фонда культуры ЕС для покрытия моих транспортных расходов и перелета
до Иркутска, но для того, чтобы полностью реализовать этот проект, я нуждаюсь в
вашей поддержке.</p>
<p><span>•<span> </span></span>Дополнительно в проект я пригласил визуального художника Константина Гузь для документации нашей поездки по Бурятии и в последствии создания видео инсталяции.</p><p> Денежные
средства пойдут на:</p><p>- артистический гонорар Константину Гузь;<br/></p><p>- оплату путешествия, авиа перелета художника до Бурятии;</p><p>- оплатау проживание и питания художника.</p><p>Информация о творчестве - <a href=""http://konstantinguz.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://konstantinguz.com</a><br/></p>
<p><span>•<span> </span></span>Для
нашего перемещения по Бурятии и побережью озера Байкал нам необходим опытный
гид-проводник для безопасного путешествия в отдаленные горные участки и на
острова Байкала.</p>
<p><span>•<span> </span></span>Мне
также необходимо оплатить мои внутренние транспортные расходы (проживание и
наземный транспорт) в Бурятии. </p>
<p><span>•<span> </span></span>Для
определенных целей нам будет необходима аренда фото/видео оборудования</p><p>

</p><h3>Влияние проекта</h3>
<p>Я твердо убежден,
что в 21 веке мы теряем наши корни, мы теряем обряды наших предков, которые
приземляют нас и дают возможность соединиться с ритмом жизни. Мы начинаем
забывать, что мы сами, как чистые человеческие существа, имеем ту глубокую силу

Introduction


I am a performance artist and musician based in London. My current work draws inspiration from rituals, especially those from ancient cultures, as a way to bring the public back into connection with themselves and their roots. In our modern city life we often move at such a fast pace we lose touch with ourselves and with each other. My art works attempt to slow the public down and bring about a deeply meditative experience in which they can connect more deeply to themselves and others. Through my collaboration with Marina Abramovic in 2014 I also saw how important this direction is in art and how strongly it affects the public.

 In July 2015 I was invited for a month-long residency at London's prestigious Barbican Centre. There I presented two new works, 'Ancestors' based on the ancient rituals and meditative music of my Lithuanian roots with Lithuanian folk singers 'Trys Keturiose'.
Now I am seeking to go even deeper into this type of research, this time working with Buryat shamans in Lake Baikal, Russia. 

Short summary

Siberian shamanism is one of the oldest traditions in the world, deeply connected to nature and to its roots and ancestors. From my research on these rich traditions and the incredible natural beauty of Lake Baikal and sacred places in Buryatia (mountains, volcanoes, rivers), I will create a new series of performances as well as a video installation together with artist Konstantin Guz which will show in a two-week solo exhibition at Fabrika Centre for Creative Industries in Moscow, October 2016.                

Konstantin Guz is a
visual artist and photographer based in Amsterdam. His work crosses interdisciplinary boundaries and explores the medium of
photography and moving image in all its depths and facets.
We also have plans to bring this exhibition on tour to the UK, USA, Netherlands, and other European countries. 
Motivation 

I want to learn from Shamans about the traditions of the Buryat people and their connection with ancestors and traditions which go back thousands of years. 
This project is extremely valuable to my artistic development, and I 
believe that through my experiences in Buryatia and work with shamans I 
will be even better able to approach my audiences and transform both 
myself and the public's emotional state through performance.  
Inspiration

Shamanism is an ancient tradition, Siberian shamanism being one of the oldest religions, which involves a person (shaman) entering into a trance-like state through music, dance, and song, during which he or she can communicate with the spirits of dead ancestors and nature, in order to bring harmony and balance to our lives on earth.  What interests me so much is their connection and respect for their ancestral traditions, as well as nature. In Buryatia, there are many fascinating natural sites sacred to shamanism, which we will visit and will be an integral part of our video work. One, for example is the island of Olkhon, in Lake Baikal, which has many special places, for example the Shaman's Rock: 

'One of the most mysterious of the Baikal sites. It is on Cape Burkhan, earlier called the ""Stone Temple."" It is comprised of white marble, granite and quartz. The first explorers to reach Lake Baikal – including the Russian scientist Vladimir Obruchev – noted that Baikal Buryats traditionally feared this site. Only shamans had the right to approach this forbidden place. If it couldn't be avoided, horses' hoofs were wrapped in felt and leather so they did not disturb the lord of Baikal.
Buryats believed that Azhin (Buryat for deity), the lord of Lake Baikal, lived in the cave at Shaman Rock. According to the testimony of villagers who lived at Khunzhir, located near Cape Burkhan, the cave was visited by shamans that settled in ancient Siberia. Pagan priests still perform rituals in the cave associated with cleansing ancestral karma and removing curses.'-A Traveller's guide to Siberia 



  
What We Need
 I have generously received some funding from the EU Cultural Foundation to cover my own flight costs to Siberia, but in order to realize this project I need your support.  In addition to myself, I have invited visual artist, Konstantin Guz, to film and photograph during our travels in Buryatia. I will need funds to pay :
- artist fee to Konstantin;- his travel expenses and flights (from his city of origin to Buryatia) - hotels and accommodation for both of us while traveling and food. You find more about him and his work here:
http://konstantinguz.com
During our travels in Buryatia and Baikal we will need to hire an experienced guide in order to travel safely and explore the remote mountains and islands of Lake Baikal. 
I will also need support to cover my internal travel costs (accommodation and land-transport) in Buryatia.
Cost of renting the equipment for filming and editing films.



Perks: Depending on donation 

Donators will be listed as exhibition sponsors at Fabrika CCI, as well as all future exhibitions related with this funding project. 
You will also be gifted with high-quality photographs, field recordings, posters, and film of our travels in spectacularly beautiful mountains and forests of Buryatia, Lake Baikal and its islands, as well as other places considered sacred to Buryat shamanism. 
Highest giving donors will be gifted with photographs as well as limited-edition footage from the video made in Buryatia, and video artworks for private home screening. 




   The Impact I strongly believe that in the 21st Century we are losing our roots - we are losing the rituals of our ancestors which keep us grounded and able to connect with the rhythms of life. We begin to forget that we ourselves, as pure human beings, have a deep strength and power that no technology can ever give. Through returning to older cultures and traditions, I create contemporary art works that seek to bring the public back into balance and harmony with themselves, contemplating their origins as well as bringing them to feel fully in the present moment. 
 During this project ""Lake of Sacred Souls: Journey to Baikal"" I will keep an online journal via Facebook page and Instagram updating with news, photos of the journey and sharing fascinating facts about that region. 


Where the project will be shown?
The premier of the project, performance and video installation, will be held at two-week solo exhibition at Fabrika CCI Gallery in Moscow, October 2016.  


After that event we also have plans to bring this exhibition on tour to the UK, USA, Netherlands, and other European countries.

­­­Меня зовут Абраам Броди.Я-перформер и
музыкант, живущий и работающий в Лондоне. Работая над текущим проектом, я
черпаю вдохновение из ритуалов, тех что берут свое начало в древних
культурах.  Наша современная городская
жизнь бежит так быстро, что мы теряем связь и с самим собой, и с друг другом.  В основе моих арт работ лежит попытка
«замедления» публики, давая им возможность испытать глубокий медитативный опыт,
который даст им возможность соединиться с собой и другими. Благодаря моему
сотрудничеству с Мариной Абрамович в 2014 году я увидел как важно это
направление в искусстве и насколько сильно это влияет на публику.  
В июле 2015 года я был приглашен на месячную
резиденцию в престижном Barbican
Centre в Лондоне. Там я представил две новые работы «Предки»,
основанную на древних ритуалах и медитативной музыки моих литовских
корней.  Сейчас я стремлюсь глубже исследовать
эту тему, на этот раз взаимодействуя с шаманами Бурятии на берегах озера
Байкал. Краткое содержание
Сибирский
шаманизм-одна из старейших в мире традиций, тесно связанная с природой и
почитающая свои корни и предков. 
Основываясь на своем исследовании богатых традиций, невероятной
природной красоте озера Байкал и священных мест Бурятии, я создам новую серию
перформансов, а также видео инсталляцию совместно с современным визуальным художником Константином Гузь, которые
будут представлены на 2-х недельной соло выставке в Центре
Творческих Индустрий ФАБРИКА,
Москва, осенью 2016 года. У нас также есть планы показа этой выставки в
Великобритании, США, Голландии и других европейских странах.
Мотивация
Я хочу получить знания шаманов о многовековых
традициях народа Бурятии и связях с их предками. 

Этот
проект является чрезвычайно ценным для моего творческого развития, и я считаю,
что через мой опыт в Бурятии и работе с шаманами я буду еще лучше
взаимодействовать с моей аудиторией и трансформировать себя и эмоциональное
состояние публики через перформанс. Вдохновление
Шаманизм-это
древняя традиция, а Сибирский шаманизм является одной из самых старых религий. Шаман-
человек, входящий в состояние транса через музыку и танец, в течение которого
он способен общаться с духами предков и природой. Что меня действительно
интересует, так это то уважение, которое они уделяют этим традициям. В Бурятии
большое количество интересных природных образований, являющихся священными
местами шаманов, которые я планирую посетить. Одно из них, гора Шаманка,
находится на острове Ольхон:
""Одно из
самых загадочных мест на Байкале. Оно находится на мысе Бурхан, ранее
называемый ""Каменный храм."" Состоит из белого мрамора, гранита и
кварца. Первые исследователи, добравшиеся до озера Байкал - в том числе
российский ученый Владимир Обручев - отметили, что буряты согласно традиции
боялись этого места. Только шаманы имели право подойти к этому запрещенному
месту. Если этой дороги не удавалось избежать, копыта лошадей заворачивали в
войлок и кожу, дабы не потревожить владыку Байкала.
Буряты считали,
что дух, владыка озера Байкал, жил в пещере горы Шаманка. По свидетельству
жителей села, которые жили в поселке Хунжир, расположенного недалеко от мыса
Бурхан, эту пещеру посещали шаманы, которые обосновались в древней Сибири.
Языческие жрецы по-прежнему выполняют в пещере ритуалы, связанные с очищением
родовой кармы и удаления проклятий.
Что нам нужно и что получаете вы

Я уже получил
грант от Фонда культуры ЕС для покрытия моих транспортных расходов и перелета
до Иркутска, но для того, чтобы полностью реализовать этот проект, я нуждаюсь в
вашей поддержке.
• Дополнительно в проект я пригласил визуального художника Константина Гузь для документации нашей поездки по Бурятии и в последствии создания видео инсталяции. Денежные
средства пойдут на:- артистический гонорар Константину Гузь;- оплату путешествия, авиа перелета художника до Бурятии;- оплатау проживание и питания художника.Информация о творчестве - http://konstantinguz.com
• Для
нашего перемещения по Бурятии и побережью озера Байкал нам необходим опытный
гид-проводник для безопасного путешествия в отдаленные горные участки и на
острова Байкала.
• Мне
также необходимо оплатить мои внутренние транспортные расходы (проживание и
наземный транспорт) в Бурятии. 
• Для
определенных целей нам будет необходима аренда фото/видео оборудования
Поощрительные
подарки (в зависимости от суммы пожертвования)

Для
тех, кто пожертвует большую сумму, получит в подарок хорошего разрешения и
высокого качества фотографии плюс отдельные видео зарисовки и готовую арт работу для домашней видео
коллекции. 
Влияние проекта
Я твердо убежден,
что в 21 веке мы теряем наши корни, мы теряем обряды наших предков, которые
приземляют нас и дают возможность соединиться с ритмом жизни. Мы начинаем
забывать, что мы сами, как чистые человеческие существа, имеем ту глубокую силу
и мощь, что ни одна технология никогда не сможет дать. Через возвращение к
старым культурам и традициям, я создаю современные произведения искусства,
которые стремятся привести публику в равновесие и к гармонии с самими собой,
созерцая свое происхождение и ощущая полноту чувств в настоящий момент.
Во время моего
путешествия я буду держать вас в курсе происходящего, делясь новостями,
впечатлениями и фотографиями через FB страницу проекта, Instagram и свой сайт.Где будет показан проект

Премьера проекта, перформанс и видео инсталяция, состоится в рамках 2х-недельной соло выставки в Центре
Творческих Индустрий ФАБРИКА,
Москва, осенью 2016 года. У нас также есть планы показа этой выставки в
Великобритании, США, Голландии и других европейских странах.

This is the template for the painting I will create for this exhibition. It depicts a central part of Péladan's cosmology, according to which, art was the gift of the angels to mankind, as the key to the reintegration with the divine. According to Péladan, mankind is the creation of the angels. He rewrote Genesis and the story of the Fall (based on his understanding of Plato and Enoch), claiming that the angels were cast to earth as eternal guides of mankind - but only if mankind evolved through becoming creators themselves, could they redeem the Fallen. Hence art and the creative impulse lies at the heart of his teachings.

Péladan's writings are unique as a work of esoteric literature that views books and paintings as talismans that can unlock worlds of esoteric knowledge, and his teachings for artists are summarised in the following illustration and quote:</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/704744/files/20140709052711-4.Exhortation.jpg?1404908831"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><span style=""background-color: initial;""><i>""Exhortation,""  by Sasha Chaitow, 2013.

Artist, you are a king: Art is the true empire, if your hand draws a perfect line, the cherubim themselves will descend to revel in their reflection.

Hi everyone, my name's Sasha Chaitow, and I'm an artist, writer, and scholar of the crossover of esoteric thought and cultural history. I've been painting since 1996, and I hold two MAs in Literature and in Western Esotericism. I have just completed my PhD in Myth and Literature, examining the life and work of the mysterious Joséphin Péladan, a French visionary author who wrote over a hundred books devoted to his cause of inspiring a cultural renaissance through esoterically inspired art. You can read more about Péladan at my dedicated website, www.peladan.org, and more about me and my various creative and scholarly projects at www.sashachaitow.co.uk.

This project
I've been invited to the OCCULT Art Salon  in Salem, MA this September to participate in the art exhibition and present a workshop on Péladan's work. I am preparing a painting for the exhibition, but I need your help to get there, as the travel expenses are well beyond what I can afford as a (barely graduated) ex-grad student.

I've also presented on a variety of esoteric and cultural topics at academic conferences and in various public venues in the US, the UK, Greece, France, Hungary, and Sweden. I've mounted 6 solo art exhibitions and participated in several group shows in Greece and Spain since 2000. Last year I organised a three-day ""festival of arts and letters"" reflecting the spirit of Péladan's Salons, and I have a proven track record of successful event and project management (see my CV for details).On a more personal note, this is the first time that I've been offered a chance to fulfil my lifelong dream of combining my  art and my scholarship in the same place and based on the same topic, The art""Bené-Satan"" or, Fate of the Oelohites, by Sasha Chaitow, 2013. This is the template for the painting I will create for this exhibition. It depicts a central part of Péladan's cosmology, according to which, art was the gift of the angels to mankind, as the key to the reintegration with the divine. According to Péladan, mankind is the creation of the angels. He rewrote Genesis and the story of the Fall (based on his understanding of Plato and Enoch), claiming that the angels were cast to earth as eternal guides of mankind - but only if mankind evolved through becoming creators themselves, could they redeem the Fallen. Hence art and the creative impulse lies at the heart of his teachings. This illustration is featured in the current issue of Abraxas Journal, and was exhibited in Madrid at the 1st Neo-Symbolist Salon in October 2013.    What I Need & What You GetThe funds I'm requesting through this campaign break down as follows:1. $2000 is to cover my travel expenses to Salem. It may seem a lot, but this covers 3 flights (Corfu-Athens-London-Boston), and a boat ride from Boston to Salem and back. This amount does not cover my accommodation and living expenses, which are kindly being provided by the event organisers.2. $500 is to buy art materials and packaging for the painting I want to create. This includes a large (2m x 70cm) canvas with a custom made wooden support, oil paints, paintbrushes, varnishes, and packing materials. 3. The remaining $1000 is to help pay my bills over the next three months, so that I can lighten my freelance load and focus on painting and preparing the workshop. In return for your help, I am offering posters, signed copies, and original illustrations from my ""Péladan project"" art series, some of which have been exhibited in Spain and Greece. See the column on the right hand side for details of ""perks"" for all contributors.The ChallengeThe main challenge is for me to be able to work on this project undistracted, and to raise the funds to get me to Salem.Even if this campaign does not reach the amount requested, every penny will go towards completing this project. Whatever happens, I will prioritise the painting and if I cannot afford to travel, then I will still create and send it to the exhibition. If less than the total amount is raised, then I will carry on doing freelance work and juggle my time as best I can, so as to bring this project to completion. In the event that the travel fund falls short, then the funds will go towards completing my Péladan project: a series of art that illustrates Péladan's work according to the principles he laid out in his manifesto, that I plan to exhibit when it is complete. So even if this campaign falls short of the goal, every penny will go towards helping me to reintroduce Péladan - through art and scholarship - to the 21st century.In every case, I will post frequent updates on my facebook page: https://www.facebook.com/SashaChaitow to let you know how the painting and travel plans are going!  The ImpactPéladan and his work are important for two main reasons: as a neglected aspect of esoteric and cultural history, and as a source of inspiration and philosophical exploration for artists. Though I have begun to make my findings public through academic venues, the artist in me strongly believes that these ideas need to be shared with the people they were written for: artists and the general public. and this is why I am so keen to participate in this project, so that can bring Péladan to an international audience. Péladan's writings are unique as a work of esoteric literature that views books and paintings as talismans that can unlock worlds of esoteric knowledge, and his teachings for artists are summarised in the following illustration and quote:""Exhortation,""  by Sasha Chaitow, 2013. Inspired by the quote by Péladan: ""Artist, you are a priest: Art is the great mystery and, if your effort results in a masterpiece, a ray of divinity will descend as on an altar. Artist, you are a king: Art is the true empire, if your hand draws a perfect line, the cherubim themselves will descend to revel in their reflection. Spiritual design, a line of the soul, form of understanding, you make our dreams flesh. Artist, you are a mage: Art is the great mystery, it only proves our immortality.""   Other Ways You Can Help I know that not everyone can contribute to the funding, but if you believe in this project, you can still help! Please help to get the word out by sharing this campaign with like-minded friends so it can get maximum exposure. I want you to know that moral support is the greatest help of all.... the work I've done so far couldn't have been completed without the encouragement and kindness of my close family and friends, but also that of total strangers who found an affinity with what I'm trying to do. If Péladan and this project inspires you, then I want to hear from you!UpdatesI will post regular updates on my public Facebook page: https://www.facebook.com/SashaChaitow , so please follow my progress there. I will also post periodical updates on my websites, www.sashachaitow.co.uk and www.peladan.org. If I can figure out how to, I will also try to update this entry! Thank you very much for reading.Sasha",3.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p></p>
<b>Dear Crowd,</b>
<p>We appreciate and are committed to
preserving the Street/Urban Art present on the walls of the world's public
spaces, and we also acknowledge that it could be gone tomorrow. We believe that
Street/Urban Art deserves to be officially taken into the canon of art history
as a qualified art form, and that is our underlying and long-term goal. The
main objective of our Indiegogo campaign, right here and now, is to finance the
location and equipment, shipping and travel expenses, and post production costs
of our first of hopefully many more COLOURS StART FESTIVAL shows, while
offering you really fantastic Limited Edition artworks at substantially reduced
prices as Perks.</p>
<p><b>OUR GOAL</b><br/></p>
<p>Ideally, during the next
renowned Berlin Gallery Weekend on May 1-3, 2015, to bring together
international artists, art lovers, agents, collectors, galleries and museums,
in order to enhance, support and drive a valuable exchange and discussion,
leading to further acknowledgement and validation of Street/Urban artworks as a
legitimate art form.</p>
<p>We, the COLOURS StART FESTIVAL Team,
need your support to bring the works of some major Street and Urban artists
from the online sphere closer to you – offline, in the real world – in the form
of local Street Art festivals, each lasting several days. We envision COLOURS
StART FESTIVALS regularly showcasing both online and offline in over 40
participating cities around the globe. See <a href=""http://coloursfestival.webs.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span>future cities here</span></a>.</p>
<p><b>WHAT DO WE NEED, AND WHAT FOR?</b><br/></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>We need to dedicate this initial
funding to secure each of the first show locations (approx. 5k), equipment
(5k), as well as third party travel expenses (5k), artwork shipping (approx.
5k), and printing and publishing (5k) costs. There's still a lot more to do, so
let's get things moving (if you are interested, please take a look at our <a href=""http://coloursfestival.webs.com/campaign"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span>stretch goals</span></a>)! The more
resources we have, the bigger and the better we can be!!! With more funds, we
can secure a larger and more central location where we can hang more (and
larger, more spectacular!) artworks appropriately, and accommodate more
visitors, as well as host a more memorable opening event, including being able
to invite the artists. Should we fail to reach our initial goals, we will still
try to work on a respectively smaller scale to put on at least one single
physical exhibition event as a solid base for future Street/Urban Art
promotional activities. </p>
<p><b>WHAT YOU GET</b></p>
<p>In addition to the warm fuzzy feeling that it can give to contribute to a project that you believe in and support, all of
your pledges will be highly rewarded with quality treats and perks. We work
together with various galleries and publishing houses, and are able to offer a
wide range of highly discounted artworks. This includes striking fine-art
prints and unmistakably stylish streetshots on Alu-Dibond, professional
hardcover exhibition books, as well as a rare selection of limited editions and
originals from upcoming young artists, along with other incredible rewards. See
images of the artworks offered as perks below, or check the official <a href=""http://coloursfestival.webs.com/perks"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span>COLOURS StART FESTIVAL</span></a>
website for larger images.  <br/></p>
<p>Bear in mind that if we are successful with this campaign and get the first COLOURS StART FESTIVAL up and running in Berlin, there are over 40 cities we aim to visit with their very own locally unique COLOURS StART FESTIVAL...and the next one might just be yours. So by contributing now, you are bringing us one step closer to you!</p>

<p><b>Your COLOURS FESTIVAL Team</b></p>
<p><br/></p> </div></div>","Dear Crowd,
We appreciate and are committed to
preserving the Street/Urban Art present on the walls of the world's public
spaces, and we also acknowledge that it could be gone tomorrow. We believe that
Street/Urban Art deserves to be officially taken into the canon of art history
as a qualified art form, and that is our underlying and long-term goal. The
main objective of our Indiegogo campaign, right here and now, is to finance the
location and equipment, shipping and travel expenses, and post production costs
of our first of hopefully many more COLOURS StART FESTIVAL shows, while
offering you really fantastic Limited Edition artworks at substantially reduced
prices as Perks.
OUR GOAL
Ideally, during the next
renowned Berlin Gallery Weekend on May 1-3, 2015, to bring together
international artists, art lovers, agents, collectors, galleries and museums,
in order to enhance, support and drive a valuable exchange and discussion,
leading to further acknowledgement and validation of Street/Urban artworks as a
legitimate art form.
We, the COLOURS StART FESTIVAL Team,
need your support to bring the works of some major Street and Urban artists
from the online sphere closer to you – offline, in the real world – in the form
of local Street Art festivals, each lasting several days. We envision COLOURS
StART FESTIVALS regularly showcasing both online and offline in over 40
participating cities around the globe. See future cities here.
WHAT DO WE NEED, AND WHAT FOR?


We need to dedicate this initial
funding to secure each of the first show locations (approx. 5k), equipment
(5k), as well as third party travel expenses (5k), artwork shipping (approx.
5k), and printing and publishing (5k) costs. There's still a lot more to do, so
let's get things moving (if you are interested, please take a look at our stretch goals)! The more
resources we have, the bigger and the better we can be!!! With more funds, we
can secure a larger and more central location where we can hang more (and
larger, more spectacular!) artworks appropriately, and accommodate more
visitors, as well as host a more memorable opening event, including being able
to invite the artists. Should we fail to reach our initial goals, we will still
try to work on a respectively smaller scale to put on at least one single
physical exhibition event as a solid base for future Street/Urban Art
promotional activities. 
WHAT YOU GET
In addition to the warm fuzzy feeling that it can give to contribute to a project that you believe in and support, all of
your pledges will be highly rewarded with quality treats and perks. We work
together with various galleries and publishing houses, and are able to offer a
wide range of highly discounted artworks. This includes striking fine-art
prints and unmistakably stylish streetshots on Alu-Dibond, professional
hardcover exhibition books, as well as a rare selection of limited editions and
originals from upcoming young artists, along with other incredible rewards. See
images of the artworks offered as perks below, or check the official COLOURS StART FESTIVAL
website for larger images.  
Bear in mind that if we are successful with this campaign and get the first COLOURS StART FESTIVAL up and running in Berlin, there are over 40 cities we aim to visit with their very own locally unique COLOURS StART FESTIVAL...and the next one might just be yours. So by contributing now, you are bringing us one step closer to you!

Since then I have been writing trying to grow and strengthen with my poetry, as well as my performance. In 2004 is when I first attended my first poetry slam in Flagstaff, AZ. I had no idea that poetry was turned into a sport where scores were given, performance and writing was judged, and most importantly the audience was involved. Later that year is when I first stepped on a stage and performed my first poem at a Poetry Slam. I remember being so scared that you could hear the paper as I shook on stage. After overcoming the fear of public speaking I have enjoyed my time performing my poetry on stage. Since then I have been on the 2011, and 2012 National Team, and this is my second year representing a venue at Women of the World Poetry Slam.</p><p></p><p>From the time in Flagstaff, AZ, I have moved to Phoenix Arizona, and have been a host, organizer, advocate, and poet to the Poetry scene here in my city. Poetry is part of my identity. After my years in Phoenix, I have moved back to Flagstaff, AZ. Trying to find my footing back into a new/old city and getting back on my feet. Competing with the Sedona Poetry Slam has been a blessing and a great experience and am Very honored to represent them with my words.</p><p></p><p>How Else Can You Help</p><p></p><p>If you are unable to donate, I understand.

Given the gift of storytelling from her father she combines story, poetry, and performance. Shebala constantly brings the voice of her heritage into her performance, and written work often treading into spaces where hearing native voices is unlikely. Shebala has competed on four National Poetry Slam Teams, Two time Women of the World Poetry Slam’s, she was also a competitor at the 2013 Individual of the World Poetry Slam. Shebala is this year's 2015’s Sedona Women of the World Poetry Slam Qualifier. Women Of the World Poetry Slam (WOWPS) is a four day poetry festival, in which 72 of the best female poets in the world compete against each other over two nights of preliminary competitions (referred to as “bouts”) . The poets with the top twelve scores from those days move on to Finals, where one poet is crowned the champion!The 2015 WOWPS will take place in downtown Albuquerque, NM, March 18-21.-Asking for Your HelpPlease help me by donating to my fundraising campaign.

Since then I have been writing trying to grow and strengthen with my poetry, as well as my performance. In 2004 is when I first attended my first poetry slam in Flagstaff, AZ. I had no idea that poetry was turned into a sport where scores were given, performance and writing was judged, and most importantly the audience was involved. Later that year is when I first stepped on a stage and performed my first poem at a Poetry Slam. I remember being so scared that you could hear the paper as I shook on stage. After overcoming the fear of public speaking I have enjoyed my time performing my poetry on stage. Since then I have been on the 2011, and 2012 National Team, and this is my second year representing a venue at Women of the World Poetry Slam.From the time in Flagstaff, AZ, I have moved to Phoenix Arizona, and have been a host, organizer, advocate, and poet to the Poetry scene here in my city. Poetry is part of my identity. After my years in Phoenix, I have moved back to Flagstaff, AZ. Trying to find my footing back into a new/old city and getting back on my feet. Competing with the Sedona Poetry Slam has been a blessing and a great experience and am Very honored to represent them with my words.How Else Can You HelpIf you are unable to donate, I understand. I would also very much appreciate if you could share this campaign to your friends, family and social media. Thank you.",0.0,0,"4 Campaigns

</div></div>","The Atlanta-Based Adult Coloring Book
The ColorATL Coloring Book, Volume 1 consists of 45 works of art from some of Atlanta's best local artists (full list of artists below). Each have created a unique page for you to intimately experience and meditatively color. While ColorATL Vol. 1 allows our patrons to relax, create, and connect more deeply to the diverse art culture of Atlanta, the backbone of this project is the 1-to-1 model.
1 : 1
We believe all should have access to the stress-relieving, therapeutic benefits of creativity. For every coloring book purchased, ColorATL will personally deliver a coloring book to someone facing hardship at one of our local, partnering health facilities and social impact organizations - Cancer centers, health and hospice homes, transitional facilities, homeless shelters, recuperative-care centers, and more. Our MissionColorATL combines the power of creative activity with the vast art culture of Atlanta to benefit those in difficult circumstances. For years, members of the ColorATL team have utilized creative activity in order to decrease stress, anxiety, and despair - and cultivate peace, joy, and hope. Something indescribably positive happens when someone grabs a pencil or paintbrush and gets out what has been pent-up inside of them.Why adult coloring books?With all the breakthrough we constantly see with therapeutic arts, the biggest hurdle remains: many self-proclaimed ""non-artists"" stare at a blank canvas and feel intimidated to begin.This is why adult coloring books are so awesome: they provide an overall structure, yet allow for personal freedom within. Which is proven to be healthy for the mind and spirit.2016 ArtistsAdam Podber - Amber Guinn - Angela Davis Johnson - Avery Robinson - Barry Lee - Brandon Sadler - Chris Veal - Connor Dwyer - Danielle Ramos - David 'Doodleslice' Cohen - Edward Rowan - Estela Semeco - Federico Tobon - Geinene Carson - Jeremy Ray - John Tindel - Julio Ceballos - Kyle 'BlackCatTips' Brooks - Lacey Longino - Lauren Pallotta - Lela Brunet - Llucy Llong - Lucas Rocheleau - Mac Stewart - Matt Evans - Maxim Beeching - Michael Jones - Molly Rose Feeman - Nate Frost - Olive47 - Dozfy - Peter Ferrari - Phil Harris - R.

<p>The
Lenormand Oracle is named for the legendary Parisian Cartomancer,
Mademoiselle Marie Anne Adelaide Lenormand (1772-1843), who divined
for some of the most influential people of her time. The Deck has its
own system which is to-the-point, clear to read, and can be used on
its own or alongside other divination systems, like the Tarot.</p>
<p>I
have been teaching and reading with Tarot and Oracle cards for over
15 years and it has been a dream of mine to create beautiful decks my
own special brand of magic to them. While teaching the Lenormand
Oracle last year I had a sudden inspiration to create my own deck.
Within 24 hours I had completed all of the rough sketches for the
cards – it was just flowing! Then, over a 6 month period, I painted
each of the cards for the deck – sometimes more than once – and
began to share them with the world.</p>
<p>Now,
I want to get the deck printed beautifully and professionally. The
last piece of the puzzle is your support, hence this campaign.</p>

<h3>The Deck Specifics</h3>
<p></p>
<p>The
completed Prince Lenormand Oracle will be smaller than regular Tarot Cards, with golden
edges, an instruction booklet, and a tuck box. The Deck consists of
39 Cards. There are the traditional 36 Cards of the Lenormand system,
with a second Man and Woman Card option (which is a “stretch goal”
– please see below) and a Wild Card.</p>
<p>The
booklet will be similar to the little white books that come with most
Oracle and Tarot decks, with simple key-words that familiarise you
with the cards and their meanings. There will also be a section on
how to read the cards. The information within this booklet will be
limited by space, so for further instruction there is the Tarot
Readers Academy, “Learn the Lenormand” Course, and a “Stretch
Goal” for a full book for those who really want to connect with and
understand this method of cartomancy.</p>
<p>The
cards will have no borders. I feel that the Lenormand Oracle system
works better this way, as most of the readings with these decks align
the cards to be read in a group or in a row, and borders will get in
the way of the reading’s flow.</p>

cards – it was just flowing! Then, over a 6 month period, I painted
each of the cards for the deck – sometimes more than once – and
began to share them with the world.
Now,
I want to get the deck printed beautifully and professionally. The
last piece of the puzzle is your support, hence this campaign.

The Deck Cards and the Back (Not in Order)


The Deck Specifics

The
completed Prince Lenormand Oracle will be smaller than regular Tarot Cards, with golden
edges, an instruction booklet, and a tuck box. The Deck consists of
39 Cards. There are the traditional 36 Cards of the Lenormand system,
with a second Man and Woman Card option (which is a “stretch goal”
– please see below) and a Wild Card.
The
booklet will be similar to the little white books that come with most
Oracle and Tarot decks, with simple key-words that familiarise you
with the cards and their meanings. There will also be a section on
how to read the cards. The information within this booklet will be
limited by space, so for further instruction there is the Tarot
Readers Academy, “Learn the Lenormand” Course, and a “Stretch
Goal” for a full book for those who really want to connect with and
understand this method of cartomancy.
The
cards will have no borders. I feel that the Lenormand Oracle system
works better this way, as most of the readings with these decks align
the cards to be read in a group or in a row, and borders will get in
the way of the reading’s flow.


I am new to the Lenormand Oracle System....

Awesome!
This is why I have added a booklet to get you started with the deck
and also have an online Course for people who want to learn to work
with the Lenormand Oracle. Additionally, there is a “stretch goal”
for a full companion book!   What We Need & What You Get What will I get?

Hopefully
you have stopped by because you are interested in owning your very
own copy of the Prince Lenormand Oracle! There are a heap of
different perks which you will find on the right side of this page.
Please select one that fits you.
Please
note that the postage is INCLUDED in the perk. There are options for
Canadian peeps and one for International peeps!

Where is the money going?


Here
is a breakdown of how the money that we raise through this campaign
will be spent. This is the closest approximation we have for the
campaign. Once we reach the stretch goals everything gets done faster
and more goodies can come your way!




82% of the Funds will go to the Printing, Delivery and Import of the Decks


10% of the Funds will go to the Designer for the Box and the Booklet


12.5% of the Funds will go to Indiegogo to process the campaign.



Stretch Goals



$3,
	500 - A second Man and Woman Card option – this also helps me to
	pay a Broker for the project.
$4,
	000 – Pouches for each backer of the Early Bird Deck, and up –
	you pre-order a Prince Lenormand Oracle Deck and you will get a
	beautiful pouch for your deck to travel with.

$6,
	000 – Full Companion Book: This will be a robust and lovely
	illustrated book with so many goodies in it! Along with the Card
	meanings and how to read them, it will also have original spreads.
	This is something that excites and frightens me, so I am putting it
	out there… let’s see if we can make it! All backers who have
	pledged $65 and above will receive the book once we hit this target.
	The funding will be used to get the book edited professionally,
	contribute to the cover design, printing, shipping, taxes, etc. The
	book will be completed by September 2015.

Risks & Challenges

 

The
biggest risk with flexible funding is that we will fall short of our
goal. That does not mean that you will not get your deck and all of
the perks that you have pledged to get: 

IF
YOU BACK THIS PROJECT YOU WILL GET YOUR DECK. STRETCH GOALS HAVE TO
BE MET TO BE FULFILLED.

<h3>About Me</h3>
<p>Hi! My name is Ninah
Mars. I’m a painter and musician born in Caracas, Venezuela and currently
living in Rome. I’ve participated in different art exhibitions with other
artists in Venezuela, Italy, Switzerland, Spain and France. I’ve decided that I
am now ready to take my career to the next level. I am organizing my very first
solo exhibition. I have worked long hours painting and preparing for this
moment. With your help I will be able to cover the expenses for the location
fee, promotion, framing of the paintings, among other costs regarding the
organization of the event. For the opening of the exhibition I would like to
incorporate my music by doing a live acoustic show where I will be playing a
series of my song from both of my albums “This is How we Pray” and “ALBOOM!”
both available on iTunes for download. I need your help to bring this dream to
life. You can help by backing this campaign or simply by sharing it with your
friends and family. I hope you can be a part of this journey with me!</p>

<p>If I had to give my art a definition I would
say that it is mainly abstract, it leaves the viewer freedom of interpretation.
They are made to intrigue, attract and immerse the viewer in my distinct view
of reality. The subjects depicted are often abstract faces, sometimes cubic and
distorted. However, there are also pure abstract shapes, lines, colors, and

Hi! My name is Ninah
Mars. I’m a painter and musician born in Caracas, Venezuela and currently
living in Rome. I’ve participated in different art exhibitions with other
artists in Venezuela, Italy, Switzerland, Spain and France. I’ve decided that I
am now ready to take my career to the next level. I am organizing my very first
solo exhibition. I have worked long hours painting and preparing for this
moment. With your help I will be able to cover the expenses for the location
fee, promotion, framing of the paintings, among other costs regarding the
organization of the event. For the opening of the exhibition I would like to
incorporate my music by doing a live acoustic show where I will be playing a
series of my song from both of my albums “This is How we Pray” and “ALBOOM!”
both available on iTunes for download. I need your help to bring this dream to
life. You can help by backing this campaign or simply by sharing it with your
friends and family. I hope you can be a part of this journey with me!

                     









SPANISH: Hola! Me llamo Ninah Mars. Soy una
pintora y músico nacida en Caracas, Venezuela y actualmente estoy viviendo en
Roma. He participado en diferentes exhibiciones colectivas en Venezuela,
Italia, Suiza, España y Francia. He decidido que estoy lista para llevar mi
carrera al siguiente nivel. Estoy organizando mi primera exhibición individual.
He trabajado por largas horas pintando y preparándome para este momento. Con tu
ayuda podré cubrir los gastos de la locación, promoción, enmarcado de las obras,
entre otros gastos relacionados a la organización del evento. Para la apertura
de la exhibición me gustaría incorporar mi música realizando un show acústico
en vivo donde cantaré una seria de canciones sacadas de mis discos This is how we pray y ALBOOM! ambos disponibles para descarga
en iTunes. Necesito de tu ayuda para hacer este sueño realidad. Me puedes
ayudar patrocinando esta campaña o simplemente compartiéndola con tus amigos y
familiares. Espero puedas ser parte de este viaje conmigo!

ITALIAN: Ciao! Mi chiamo Ninah Mars. Sono una
pittrice e musicista nata a Caracas, Venezuela, attualmente risiedo a Roma. Negli
ultimi anni ho partecipato a diverse mostre collettive in Venezuela, Italia,
Svizzera, Spagna e Francia. Adesso è giunto il momento di portare la mia
carriera al livello successivo. Sto organizzando la mia prima mostra personale.
Ho lavorato duramente preparandomi per questo momento, dedicando lunghe ore ai
miei quadri. Con il vostro aiuto potrò far fronte ai costi e alle spese legate
all’organizzazione dell’evento tra cui: l’affitto dello spazio espositivo, la
promozione e il marketing, la preparazione e l’allestimento delle opere.
Durante l’inaugurazione della mostra porterò in scena anche la mia musica, realizzando
una performance live acustica in cui canterò alcuni dei miei pezzi più famosi
tratti dagli album This is how we pray
e ALBOOM!, entrambi disponibili su
iTunes. Aiutatemi affinché il mio sogno si trasformi in realtà! Ecco cosa
potete fare: supportare economicamente con un contributo a vostra scelta questa
campagna o, semplicemente, condividendola con i vostri amici e familiari. Fate
la scelta giusta, intraprendete quest’avventura con me! 

My Art:




If I had to give my art a definition I would
say that it is mainly abstract, it leaves the viewer freedom of interpretation.
They are made to intrigue, attract and immerse the viewer in my distinct view
of reality. The subjects depicted are often abstract faces, sometimes cubic and
distorted. However, there are also pure abstract shapes, lines, colors, and
brush strokes for pure aesthetic purposes

Of the 72 teams that competed, San Diego made it into the semi finals and finished in the top 20. 7 years later, San Diego has blossomed into a perennial contender; cultivating 2 Women of the World Poetry Slam Finalists, 2 Individual World Poetry Slam Finalists, 1Individual World Poetry Slam Champion, a National Underground Poetry Individual Championship Winner and has made an appearance in the National Poetry Slam Finals. </p><p>This year, our team consists of 5 dynamic poets (Imani Cezanne, Rudy Francisco, The Saint, Jerrica Escoto &amp; Joe Limer) who are working diligently and preparing to represent San Diego in this year's National Poetry Slam. </p><p>Many have asked how they can assist in this journey and there are a few ways in which this can happen. </p><p>1. You can attend exhibition matches and cheer for us. </p><p>2. You can offer words of encouragement </p><p>3. You can donate. </p><p>We are raising funds to cover a portion of our travel and lodging costs. Every dollar brings us closer to our goal and every contribution matters.

Of the 72 teams that competed, San Diego made it into the semi finals and finished in the top 20. 7 years later, San Diego has blossomed into a perennial contender; cultivating 2 Women of the World Poetry Slam Finalists, 2 Individual World Poetry Slam Finalists, 1Individual World Poetry Slam Champion, a National Underground Poetry Individual Championship Winner and has made an appearance in the National Poetry Slam Finals. This year, our team consists of 5 dynamic poets (Imani Cezanne, Rudy Francisco, The Saint, Jerrica Escoto & Joe Limer) who are working diligently and preparing to represent San Diego in this year's National Poetry Slam. Many have asked how they can assist in this journey and there are a few ways in which this can happen. 1. You can attend exhibition matches and cheer for us. 2. You can offer words of encouragement 3. You can donate. We are raising funds to cover a portion of our travel and lodging costs. Every dollar brings us closer to our goal and every contribution matters.

<p>In addition to
supporting the Nassar family, the owners of the Tent of Nations, we will work

just and lasting peace.  We will partner
with those who reject the use of violence, Palestinians and Israelis alike, and
instead turn to creative, proactive strategies that advance equal rights and
foster dignity.  </p>
<p>The Center is developing
a new culture and practice of Jewish Nonviolence in North American and the EU,
Israel and Palestine.  The Center will
train and mobilize members of the international Jewish community to join
Israeli and Palestinian nonviolent activists seeking to secure human and civil
rights.  </p>
<p>There are Palestinians
and Israelis engaged in nonviolent activism, working courageously for equality,
dignity.  Jews throughout the world find
themselves in alignment with the values and vision of the growing Palestinian –
Israeli nonviolent movement.  </p>
<p>However, there is no
organizational vehicle in the international Jewish community to directly
support Palestinians and Israelis engaged in grassroots nonviolent
activism.  We aim to fill that gap.  </p>
<p>The horrific tragedy of
the violence – again – in the summer of 2014 in Gaza and Israel highlights the
urgency of cultivating a culture and practice of nonviolent activism.  </p><p></p><p><b>How you can help:</b></p><p>1. Contribute financially today, to support new trees and this delegation.</p><p>2. Come on the tree replanting delegation in February 2015. <a href=""https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1DV03_aev7ML2jgqNr7zOBuU9irJ0S9mEYe_arcTIEoY/viewform"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Apply here.</a></p><p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">3. Join our public awareness campaign in your home community. </span><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Send an email to <u>CenterForJewishNonviolence@gmail.com</u> to get involved. </span></p><p><b>Delegation

<p>This is the name of the farm owned by the Nassar
family, where the Tent of Nations is based. The farm grows olives, grape vines,
almonds, vegetables &amp; fruit on about 100 acres of land. The family has fought a legal battle to keep the land since it was threatened with
confiscation in 1991. The issue is ongoing but so much has been achieved, and
we continue to work to protect and develop the farm as a place where people can
meet, work together and learn.</p>
<p>Many areas of Palestinian land are threatened with
confiscation if they are not maintained and cultivated. We hope to inspire
others to work to bring life to these areas and protect their endurance.</p>

</div></div>","This year, help
us replant trees on the Palestinian farm Tent of Nations, to replace those
uprooted by the Israeli government.
Strategic nonviolence can
lift oppression from an oppressive situation rather than lay blame or dictate
the choosing of sides.  
We are mobilizing the
international Jewish community to partner with Palestinians and Israelis who
have rejected violence and instead are relying on peaceful measures to secure
dignity and human rights.
Our first delegation will replant trees
on the Palestinian farm Tent of Nations to replant the 1,500 trees uprooted by
the Israeli government. 
** All contributions to the Center for Jewish Nonviolence/T'ruah (our fiscal sponsor and partner) are tax-deductible. **We need your support to:
Purchase new trees for the farm and invest in new farm
equipment *** Goal: 250 trees and 25 new shovels, spades and hoesProvide scholarships to volunteer tree planters *** Goal: 10 scholarshipsSecure the long-term sustainability of this peace work *** Goal: part-time organizer; websiteImplement workshops & trainings in nonviolence *** Goal: 5 workshops
“As a young Jewish girl growing up in America, I saved
my quarters to plant trees in Israel.  This year, I’m planting trees for the Palestinians.”
Ilana Sumka, founder, Center for Jewish NonviolenceOped: The Fate of Fruit Trees, Moment Magazine

Replanting Delegation, February 15-20, 2015
This delegation is
convened under the auspices of the Center for Jewish Nonviolence, a new project
under the fiscal sponsorship of and in partnership with T’ruah.
In addition to
supporting the Nassar family, the owners of the Tent of Nations, we will work
to advance the efforts of Palestinians and Israelis who are utilizing
nonviolent activism as a means to end the Israeli occupation and to advance a
just and lasting peace.  We will partner
with those who reject the use of violence, Palestinians and Israelis alike, and
instead turn to creative, proactive strategies that advance equal rights and
foster dignity.  
The Center is developing
a new culture and practice of Jewish Nonviolence in North American and the EU,
Israel and Palestine.  The Center will
train and mobilize members of the international Jewish community to join
Israeli and Palestinian nonviolent activists seeking to secure human and civil
rights.  
There are Palestinians
and Israelis engaged in nonviolent activism, working courageously for equality,
dignity.  Jews throughout the world find
themselves in alignment with the values and vision of the growing Palestinian –
Israeli nonviolent movement.  
However, there is no
organizational vehicle in the international Jewish community to directly
support Palestinians and Israelis engaged in grassroots nonviolent
activism.  We aim to fill that gap.  
The horrific tragedy of
the violence – again – in the summer of 2014 in Gaza and Israel highlights the
urgency of cultivating a culture and practice of nonviolent activism.  How you can help:1. Contribute financially today, to support new trees and this delegation.2. Come on the tree replanting delegation in February 2015. Apply here.3. Join our public awareness campaign in your home community. Send an email to CenterForJewishNonviolence@gmail.com to get involved. Delegation

for this delegation are:
Daoud Nassar,  Tent of Nations

The Tent
Of Nations Project  (from Tent of Nation's website)
This project seeks to bring people of various
cultures together to build bridges of understanding, reconciliation and peace.
We invite young people from around the world, especially from areas of
conflict, together for face-to-face interaction.
Daher’s Vineyard
This is the name of the farm owned by the Nassar
family, where the Tent of Nations is based. The farm grows olives, grape vines,
almonds, vegetables & fruit on about 100 acres of land. The family has fought a legal battle to keep the land since it was threatened with
confiscation in 1991. The issue is ongoing but so much has been achieved, and
we continue to work to protect and develop the farm as a place where people can
meet, work together and learn.
Many areas of Palestinian land are threatened with
confiscation if they are not maintained and cultivated. We hope to inspire
others to work to bring life to these areas and protect their endurance.

<h3>Hi Everybody!</h3>
<p>Thank you for visiting our Indiegogo campaign page for our short film ""Walls.""</p>
<p>""Walls"" is a story that we can only tell with the help of you (Who? Me?  Yes! You.). Thematically, it is about a universal part of the human condition: feeling lost and emotionally stuck after the loss of a relationship. We hope that its sentiments will resonate with anyone who has experienced this.</p>
<p>Every time a movie is shot and produced to fruition, it is a miracle. There are countless moving parts, complications, details to be ironed out and fires to be put out, in the process of creating films.</p>
<p>In order to be successful in shooting our 14 page script over the course of 2 days, as producers we need to be as prepared as possible. While we feel very much up for the test, our biggest barrier to success is that filmmaking is also, unfortunately, a very expensive art form.</p>
<p>We have devised as bare boned and concise of a budget as possible to pull off our film.  If you choose to donate, your money will be going towards:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Talent</p></li>
<li><p>Crew</p></li>
<li><p>Equipment Rental (Camera, Audio, Lighting)</p></li>

<p>As a contributor, you will become a part of the ""Walls"" production family, receiving special perks and insights to the project's progress throughout the production and after.</p>

</div></div>","Koop nu u tickets via IN&UIT: http://www.ticketsbrugge.be/nl/monu-4Vijf jonge kunstenaars creëren naar aanleiding van ‘100 jaar WO I’ het multimediale oorlogsrequiem MONU. Hedendaagse klassieke muziek (voor koor, orkest, orgel en solisten) en een origineel libretto vormen de basis van een 80 minuten durend oorlogsrequiem. Abstract-poëtische filmfragmenten, een enscenering en een eigentijdse choreografie zijn de multimedia-elementen die dit oorlogsrequiem ook visueel interessant maken. De creatie van MONU vindt plaats op 22 april 2015 in het Concertgebouw te Brugge. Een uiterst symbolische datum, want op die dag zal het exact 100 jaar geleden zijn dat in Ieper de eerste gasaanval plaatsvond. Dit trieste gebeuren staat geboekstaafd als het beginpunt van de chemische oorlogsvoering. Het is onze expliciet bedoeling dit momentum een eeuw later met een positieve en humane boodschap van antwoord te dienen. Maar creëren kost geld en daarom willen we deze voorstelling mee helpen financieren aan de hand van een crowdfund.Website MONUIn ruil voor uw bijdrage schenken wij u graag iets wat blijvend aan MONU herinnert: een postkaart, een muziekopname of een gesigneerde partituur. Ook kan u partner worden van dit project; door het gehele requiem, of een klein deel ervan, op te dragen aan een persoon, een groep of een zaak naar keuze. Bijvoorbeeld aan een familielid die als soldaat is omgekomen in WO I of WO II, aan een vriend die in ander oorlogsgeweld gestorven is, of aan een geliefde die haar of zijn eigen strijd verloren heeft. De mogelijkheden zijn eindeloos. Deze dedicatie staat in de partituur gedrukt en in het programmaboekje krijgt u, zo u wil, de ruimte om het verhaal achter de dedicatie te vertellen. Zo worden ook uw intenties meegenomen in het geheel van deze herdenking. Door ons te steunen maak je ook kans op een duoticket voor de voorstelling waarvan we er, tijdens de crowdfund, elke week één weggeven.Vijf jonge mensen met een hart voor hedendaagse klassieke muziek, elk vanuit verschillende perspectieven en achtergronden.

Een aantal van de leden van synART realiseerden in 2013 de opera ACUBENS. Dit werk werd in 2013 gecomponeerd door Benjamien Lycke, die hiermee zijn master Compositie aan het Conservatorium Gent succesvol afsloot. Het is hoogst ongebruikelijk dat een masterstudent het voor elkaar krijgt een volledige opera te schrijven en deze daarna ook nog eens professioneel op te voeren (niet concertant, maar met een regie, kostuums en een interessant toneelbeeld). Jason Slabbynck ontwierp het decor van ACUBENS en was verantwoordelijk voor de algemene grafische vormgeving. Simon Decraene hielp mee op organisatorisch vlak en Mithra Van Eenooghe was één van de uitvoerende muzikanten.Gerichte promotie zorgde ervoor dat de Miryzaal van het Conservatorium Gent - voor het eerst sinds jaren - nokvol zat. ACUBENS werd tijdens de creatie opgenomen en later integraal uitgezonden op OP12 (het derde kanaal van de VRT).

The space required new plumbing, electric, and heating systems, in addition to a number of structural and cosmetic repairs.As young working artists we were not able to pay for the total cost of renovations ourselves. With volunteer labor and the financial support of grants and fundraisers we have brought the space to a point where we are almost ready to host our 2014 residents, but we still need your help!Where will the money go?Plumbing Installation: $4,500Floor and Ceiling Repair: $2,400Electrical Repair: $4,800Insulation: $1,700Drywall: $4,000Tools: $400Total: $17,800Why $10,000?Yes, we would love to fund-raise the total amount of our renovations but luckily we have gotten this far with help from various sources including Soup N’at, an outreach grant from Penn State University, support from our fiscal sponsor the Bloomfield Garfield Corporation, and a recent loan from friends & family.$10,000 will help us get the finishing renovation touches we desperately need in order to start our new year of residents. Every dollar funded above the $10,000 will fund our monthly operating costs and programmed events.We have put in plenty of our own money and time to make this project happen, but if we raise $10,000 we will be able to finish installing our resident kitchen & bathroom, which is currently a set of hand-me-down fixtures sitting in the frame of the bathroom. How can you help?Help us meet our goal by donating to the campaign! Share the link with friends and family!

What's this? I'm Chris, an artist an musician who lives in Norwich, UK. I've been drawing and creating nearly all my life and for almost as long as I can remember I've been fascinated by the Tarot. 
For many years I've wanted to create my own unique deck and now that I've completed the minor arcana I've started this campaign in order to produce printed copies of the deck for tarot enthusiasts everywhere to enjoy!
I wanted the images to be more than just a re-imagining or style change of the popular tarot standards. I wanted to introduce new perspectives to the classic interpretations and to reflect the synergy of a diverse modern perspective with the ancient wisdom the tarot embodies. 



The cards are small to allow this tarot to be used easily whenever and wherever! I love this small format as its so much easier to shuffle and handle and you don't kneed so much room to lay out a full spread, perfect for train journeys or at the pub! The original deck I'm creating consists of hand drawn images on small cards cut to the golden ratio (5 by 8.1 cm). This will be reproduced at exactly the same scale so you get a really personal feel from the deck.
The Mercurial tarot is quite different from the norm but I hope it will be something that both experienced readers and newcomers to tarot can enjoy.





How it all came to be..

I remember finding a deck my dad kept in in a wooden box in the living room. The images on the cards  seemed so strange, each tiny scene clearly meant something, like part of a dream, the odd characters seemed to know something more than I did about the world. It was odd to me that my Dad, an atheist schooled in science should own something so clearly superstitious, filled with fairy tale characters and strange symbols. 

For a long time they remained a puzzling thing in a box on a high shelf but eventually I learned how to use them and they began to give up their secrets. When I began to understand what the tarot really was it opened up an ever expanding well of inspiration for me and I knew that one day I would have to create my own deck.
Some 11 years later and here it is! Hopefully the first of many...
I realized after a few false starts that the imagery needed to come quickly and instinctively. I wanted the images to  be clean and clear and I liked the idea of a small deck that could fit in your pocket or in a pack for a long journey. 

Creating this deck meant a great deal to me and to begin with it really was just for me. While I was making it though people started to take an interest and I realized it could become something a lot of people could enjoy using. This deck incorporates both my life experiences and the philosophy these have left me with. It draws from various magical, spiritual and occult beliefs but it also reflects the modern world just as the original tarot reflected the culture of its time. I hope it will add another facet to the steadily growing pantheon of modern tarot decks.









What I Need & What You Get
 I really hope my deck can become something which many people can enjoy but I don’t have the funds to simply produce the decks on my own. I hope this campaign will provide a platform to reach people and the pledging system means I can get just the finds I need to produce the deck for everyone that wants to own one and everyone’s happy! 

So where will your money go?
1. Printing the cards

2. Printing a codex to accompany the deck
3. Creating the bags and custom hard cases for the deluxe version (for some reason a golden rectangle is not a standard size for packaging!)
4. Shipping the deck to you.
5. …and my dinner!


I decided to to several tiers of production to keep it accessible.

The basic package will just include all the cards in a lovely cotton drawstring bag.

Those who want to know more about the unique images I've created can get the package which includes the codex I've produced specifically for use with this deck. 

And for those who want the full works in the deluxe package the cards will come wrapped in red or black silk with a signed codex and in a custom hard travel case.

I've chosen flexible funding so that even if I don't reach my goal everyone who has contributed to the project will receive the package they paid for. I want people to use and enjoy this unique tarot and this was the best way to achieve that!




What you're doing for me..  I have been producing and selling my own artwork for years but successful trade relies on me keeping my overheads low. This will be the first time I've used indiegogo to help a project go far beyond what I could achieve on my own. If this is a success believe me I'll be back with more projects.



Where we stand
The printing process is planned out as well as the materials for the custom cases and packaging. All I need is your money to make this happen and you will receive exactly what you pay for, what could be fairer!

He turned around to face them, said, “Thank you.” and continued on his way.</p><p>“It was embarrassing.” Chevi says about being verbally assaulted. “There were so many people around. There are so many students in the area and everyone could hear what they were saying to me!”He texted a friend about what had happened, not realizing that the van had begun backing up towards him. It stopped and the three men jumped out of the car and assaulted him.

Description MISSION:We hope to inspire Canadians to take action and support us on July 19, 2014 for our annual march and rally and to grow a community committed to ending bullying, hate crimes and homophobia.BACKGROUND:“”Chevi tells me that as he was walking to Safeway, a vehicle pulled up beside him. Inside there were three men. “They stopped at the intersection beside me,” he says. “They started shouting anti-gay comments such as, ‘Hey faggot, you’re a fucking faggot, you faggot!’” Chevi handled this verbal attack with remarkable poise and well, fabulousness. He turned around to face them, said, “Thank you.” and continued on his way.“It was embarrassing.” Chevi says about being verbally assaulted. “There were so many people around. There are so many students in the area and everyone could hear what they were saying to me!”He texted a friend about what had happened, not realizing that the van had begun backing up towards him. It stopped and the three men jumped out of the car and assaulted him. Area residents saw everything that happened and ran to his rescue.”"" (2012, Autostraddle interview by Malaika)Within weeks Chevi inspires the public to stand up for Social Equality and Anti- Bullying after homophobes attacked him in public on July 19, 2012. He is turning a negative and traumatic experience in his life into an opportunity to bring attention and exposure to one of the problems that is plaguing our society. On Aug 2nd 2012 Chevi led a successful March and Rally with speeches given from a number of Alberta’s Prominent Politicians such as Alberta Deputy Premier, Thomas Lukaszuk. His story gained much media attention and his message was heard loud and clear:“I hope that my story helps someone know that it’s okay to be yourself, that it is okay to be openly gay, lesbian, bisexual, or transgender. You are valued in our society. And life is worth living. ” Chevi RabbitOn April 9, 2014 Chevi Rabbit receives the Alberta Hate Crime Committee, “2014 Hate Crime Awareness Youth Award” by MLA Minister of Justice and Solicitor General the Honorable Jonathan DenisWhat We Need & What You GetFunding will be used in the following areas:

<p>The thinking behind a way a lone a last a loved a long the begins with a commonplace observation: the ever-accelerating rate of change in our lives leads us to look for order amidst disorder.

Our Story                                   Note: [Make a point to view above 'GALLERY'] 

'GLOBAL ArtXchanges was formed officially over 4 years ago, here in Canada. 

I am Art
director/co-ordinator, Vesa Peltonen, founder of this compassionate organization,
dedicated to better ART for NEEDY World youth. I've helped aboriginal students
gain confidence through art. I worked as an advisor for the Ontario Art Council
and have . I've had a rewarding 30 yr. career in the arts, time to give back with purpose.

This campaign is much about caring, compassion &
determination. 'GLOBAL ArtXchanges is
meant to 'enliven the lives' of the youth who are in small art groups/art schools world-wide that do not have the resources to get proper art
supplies. Note: we don't send money. We only send the art materials/tools to the
contact person, director/instructor requests. ~We make sure they receive it.  IT WORKS! 


Note of Importance: 'GLOBAL ArtXchanges' already helped in Africa, Mexico, Canada, and
Nepal & sent them for art supplies successfully. The young students send
us artwork, which will be used in a 'World Youth Art Peace Exhibition' within 2 yrs.
t.b.a.. It was an incredible feeling to have students receive proper art
materials in March in Kathmandu, Nepal. They are now sustaining this art
program, & we do the follow up. The artwork that we get from each place we
help, will be apart of an exhibition showing 'The Youth Art,' we have collected,
being one later culminating Event. We've already put in money & will receive funds
from other sources, such as grants and special art council funding, as for our video. 

The Funds go to 3
areas. 
(1) Sending Art Supplies to Needy Youth Art Groups
World-wide~ ongoing.

(2) To create a 'World Youth Art Peace' Exhibition-from
art given by the places we have helped later. 

(3) We would like to do short film documentary, which
will likely have money from other sources.

The Impact   

The impact enlivens
world youth, gives them hope, a sence of accomplishment, but affects in a
positive way also their family, friends, & neighbourhood. Their Community
will get involved, creating volunteering and jobs. We have already seen that
happen, in Ghana for example. The community begins to share in the
responsibility to sustain this effort. Since the young artists have proper art
supplies to work with, this puts smiles on the faces of everyone. Having family
and teachers begin to share in the responsibility of motivating their youth
thus enriches the spirit in people and involving many in this focus of the
future of their children's education. 


""No one
can take a young person’s imagination away."" as is said. 
What We Need & What
You Get 


We need to reach a minimum
fundraising goal of $9,000. (U.S.D) 

Look NOW in the INCENTIVES for the various
contribution levels & each one will give back something for your
generosity.

And as a result, <span>a vast majority of the wealth from their sales (upwards of 60%) end up outside of their communities.

Update
Hi all!
We have only days left in our campaign, and we’d like to thank everyone who has given support and helped to spread the word. Although the overall response has been poor, we will continue to develop and grow the AfriMod concept of providing a platform for artisans to reach the common global market.
You can, of course, always find us at afrimod.com where we continue to offer products made by various artisans. AfriMod continues to grow– adding new artisans and new products. We hope you will continue to spread the word and shop afrimod.com for your eclectic modern global interior décor and boho chic fashion & accessories.
Once again, thanks to everybody!
We're creating a space in West Africa for artists, designers and artisans to establish direct access to the global market and connect with creative communities worldwide.Help us build this highly needed infrastructure to expand artisan access, improve income opportunities and encourage collaboration between artisans globally.        This project, the AfriMod Xchange, is designed as an on-the-ground, walk-in counterpart to the online marketplace, afrimod.com.  It is a community space that seeks to bridge the knowledge divide and help local artists, designers and artisans gain access to the global online market.  What We've Done So FarThere are high costs associated with this project. We have provided the initial funding for all aspects of the design, construction and implementation of the eCommerce platform afrimod.com (launched March 1, 2015). In addition, we have funded several trips for two team members to Africa in 2012, 2013 and 2014.These trips gave us ample opportunities to connect with artists, designers, artisans and individuals. They also enabled us to identify Jos, Nigeria as the most appropriate location for AfriMod to take root in Africa. However, the actual completion of the AfriMod Xchange cannot proceed without this current stage of preparation. The more money we raise, the better the facilities we build and the greater the impact we can have. This CampaignThe current campaign target of $50,000 will help AfriMod formalize and expand operations on-the-ground in Africa— aggregating artisans and assisting them to participate in online sales. And we’re featuring some really cool perks for all... in time for the holidays!From Millennials to Baby-boomers, utility to collector’s items, traditional or contemporary – we have something for everyone. Your purchases and contributions will go towards completing this ambitious project. Every dollar we receive will enable you to become a part of the building of a future where people connect with one another, build better human understanding, and creativity has no boundary.We need your help to complete the AfriMod Xchange as a gathering place that serves as a confluence for creativity, innovation and design. A place for social interactions, welcoming artists, designers and artisans to congregate, to innovate new products, new ideas and concepts, attend workshops or special events - an informal club for its regular members. We want to raise as much money as possible to change lives.     That Africa is a continent of deep, diverse cultural and artistic heritage is so often repeated in social discourse that one wonders why it is so difficult to shop a wide variety of African products globally. Meanwhile, in cities, towns and villages across Africa, artists, designers and artisans are creating exceptional contemporary and traditional works in home furnishings, decorative crafts, fine art, fashion & accessories, beauty products, etc.Sadly though, most of these artisans are cut off from the global market simply because they are not computer and Internet savvy. Most have to rely on middlemen to get their products sold outside their communities. And as a result, a vast majority of the wealth from their sales (upwards of 60%) end up outside of their communities. Furthermore, weak infrastructure support, logistics and difficulty accessing the Internet create additional obstacles that make it virtually impossible for these artists, designers and artisans to improve their income.    Over the past three years, our team members have made several trips to West Africa and worked directly with local artists, designers and artisans. In the process, we have developed a system that, 
Allows these makers to set their own prices and deal directly with global shoppers online,
Ensures fair-trade between makers and buyers; and creates opportunities for makers to improve their incomes,
Enables direct maker involvement in the work of selling their items to global shoppers through a single dedicated eCommerce platform (afrimod.com),
Provides hands-on management, training and logistics support to makers at the local level,
Encourages collaboration among makers in Africa and with their global counterparts.
 Due to the high costs, size and complexity of this project, we have designed it to roll out in three distinct, manageable components...    In the first phase, we designed, built and launched (March 01, 2015), the online marketplace AfriMod.com.AfriMod.com is a free listing service dedicated exclusively to African and Africa-inspired art, design and decor.  Makers sell their works directly without middlemen and have the option of four separate account types:
Standard account, for sellers of physical products,
Visual Artists’ account, for visual artists and graphic designers,
Associate account, for individuals in Africa capable of training, organizing and assisting others in their communities,
Incubator account, specifically designed to help first-time technology users participate in eCommerce.
 We recognize that computer and Internet literacy is marginal, but fast-growing across most of Africa, and that many talented makers are offline and unable to access the global market. Therefore to succeed, the AfriMod model calls for an initial, physical, on-the-ground presence to enable us to train and assist makers to do the work of selling directly by themselves.          During the second phase, starting early 2016, we return to W. Africa (Jos, Nigeria) to start work on developing a community space that will serve as the nucleus for the AfriMod Xchange. Our presence on-the-ground will enable us to formalize and expand the process of aggregating artists, designers and artisans and helping them to sell independently to global shoppers. In the process, we contribute to building lasting human connections, thriving communities and better incomes.Team members at the AfriMod Xchange will work closely with local and regional makers to identify areas of need such as,
understanding international standards (materials, sizing, potential applications, color trends, packaging, etc)
determining which of their products have the best sales potential
creating their online shops and personal profiles
designing their identities and branding assets
training and assistance with product photography
writing product descriptions, etc.
in certain cases 
providing small capacity-building grants
warehousing and shipping services
With logistics support, we help artists, designers and artisans navigate the “last mile” to successfully bring their products online. As a result of our assistance and support, makers we work with are able to increase their incomes quite substantially.           Phase three (pending)We’ve already started to work with makers in several countries in Africa. Now, we’re in the process of raising funds that would enable us to build a permanent location that will include an office, space for training and workshops plus several maker-spaces that can house residents and visiting international artists, designers, makers and guests. It is estimated that on completion, the Phase Three aspect of this project would require an additional $150,000.Our primary objective is to have a continuous cycle of creative collaboration among makers - local, regional and international. In addition, the presence of vibrant traditional artisanal communities within the geographic surroundings present multiple opportunities for discovery, inspiration and testaments to the linkages between art and cultural heritage.We are humbled by the size of Africa, an extremely large continent with complex cultural and geopolitical diversity.To expand our reach across the continent, our long-term plans call for the creating of partner maker ecosystems in several geographic regions such as: the Maghreb, Sahel, West Coast, East Coast, Southern and Central Africa.         Jos was chosen primarily for its location within a region that is rich in history with access to multiple maker communities. It is an old city in the middle-belt region of Nigeria defined by rocky landscapes, rolling hills and mild temperate climate.Due to its location on a plateau, 1,238m above sea level, its seasonal temperatures range between 18-22°C (64-72°F) with the coldest period between December and February.Jos is situated within a geographic area of ancient civilizations and cultures such as, Nok, Tiv, Jukun, Hausa/Fulani, Birom, Angas, Nupe, Idoma, etc, as well as crafting communities, museums and game reserves.    Regrettably, Jos and its geographic surroundings have been subjected to multiple terrorist bombings (Boko Haram) and violent sectarian clashes since 2001. Hundreds have lost their lives and the local economy has suffered substantially as a result. Jos is not completely safe and presents major challenges but the city center, close to the Museum of Traditional Nigerian Architecture, is relatively secure and a good location for the AfriMod Xchange to take root.   Our story is all about people, dreamers who believe that anything is possible; human stories of passion and hope. A story about people connecting with one another in ways that help build better human understanding. It is also a story about providing opportunities to artists, designers, artisans and micro-businesses to reach a global market that would otherwise be inaccessible.There’s really nothing else like AfriMod … association with Africa’s rural beginnings, a very authentic story telling method that focuses on individuals, and a brand persona that reflects the iconic grit and sheer tenacity of brand Africa itself. On its own however, AfriMod is just a platform to get products in front of global shoppers wherever they may be; but with its community of artists, designers, artisans, associates, micro-businesses and shoppers, AfriMod is a living breathing entity. This vibrant community gives AfriMod credibility and makes it real; and this in itself is something authentic – something that gives AfriMod a soul.     Thank you for helping us build the AfriMod Xchange.

Vive en Montréal, Canadá desde el año 2007 y su trabajo se basa tanto en fotografía como en instalación y video.

Su interés por establecer una conexión con el espectador a través del arte, crear una mayor consciencia social y hacer el arte más accesible al público en general la ha llevado a utilizar métodos alternos de representación como lo son sus intervenciones de arte públicas.</span></span></p>

Questa mostra fa vedere come le piccole parole di ogni giorno ormai a noi banali hanno un effetto negativo nella psiche della gente sia donne che uomini e specialmente nei bambini che cresceranno con l'idea che gli uomini sono meglio delle donne. Le frase tipo: ""questo non e' un gioco per bambine"" ""mio marito mi lasca lavorare"" le donne al volante sono un pericolo constante"" o addirittura ""sei peggio di una donna"" hanno un forte influsso negativo nel immagine di essere donna e aumentano di piu' l'idea della donna badante e uomo provveditore. Tutto ciò influisce negativamente la crescita dei bambini. Questa mostra e per combattere il machismo facendo vedere a tutti che le piccole frasi del genere anche se non gli si da' tanta importanza fanno un male constante. Prima ci si abitua alla parola in se, che poi diventa un pensiero indelebile, proprio come dei tatuaggi. Tatuaggi che portiamo addosso e avvolte neanche ci ricordiamo di averli, Infatti l'artista CERRUCHA (Claudia Espinosa), trasmette questo messaggio tramite l'arte della fotografia tatuando nel corpo dei modelli queste frasi, che proprio come dei tatuaggi ci si cresce insieme e ci si vive la quotidianità come se nulla fosse, come se questi pensieri non esistessero, ma che sono costantemente impresse nella pelle come nella mente, indelebili; proprio come i tatuaggi. Questa mostra e' la seconda fase di questo intero progetto, la prima e' già stata realizzata nel città del Messico, e ora qui a Montreal Canada; Ma abbiamo bisogno di raccogliere dei fondi per realizzare questa mostra, e i soldi raccolti serviranno per fare imprimere le immagini, ed e' proprio li che abbiamo bisogno del vostro aiuto. date ciò che potete, grazie. </span></span></span><span style=""font-family: 'Abadi MT Condensed Light';""><span style=""font-size: large;""><br/></span></span><span style=""color: #333333;""><span style=""font-family: 'Abadi MT Condensed Light';""><span style=""font-size: large;"">Potete vedere il link del progetto qui sotto. </span></span></span><a href=""http://www.indiegogo.com/cerruchainvisible2"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span style=""color: #3b5998;""><span style=""font-family: 'Abadi MT Condensed Light';""><span style=""font-size: large;""><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">http://www.indiegogo.com/cerruchainvisible2</span></span></span></span></a></p>

ENGLISH:
Who is CERRUCHA?
My name is Claudia Espinosa a.k.a. CERRUCHA. I am a Mexican visual artist based in Montréal. My work is about communicating socially relevant themes such as gender issues, multiculturalism, and the construction of identity. I aim to be provocative with my work, engaging the viewer in a way that leads her/him into a reflection about their self-perception as well as that of their surroundings. I strive to use art as a means for change within my society.
I´m on the second phase of my photographic project titled In-Visible. Where I expose how misogyny is perpetuated through language in different cultures. I have previously completed phase one of the project, which was exhibited as a street art intervention in Mexico City in 2010. The project was done on newspaper, printing 8,000 images that were wheat pasted over 8.6km in one of Mexico City´s main avenues. I believe that art has the power to rise awareness, and In-Visible is my tool to achieve this.
Your donations will make possible the second phase of In-Visible. I am on the final stage of the project, and now I only need the post-production process to be completed.
What is the purpose of CERRUCHA's project IN-VISIBLE?
In-Visible examines machismo behaviour within different cultures. I aim to raise awareness about the way language is used as a way of perpetuating misogyny, being rooted in the core of our most common thoughts and sayings.I n order to reshape our society, we need to question what we´ve been taught and how it affects us both men and women. In-Visible does this by playing with the concept of tattooing, creating a visual metaphor in which the individuals portrayed are psychologically tattooed by the colloquialisms they have written on their skin. In a series of 10 large format portraits, I isolate such phrases giving the viewer time to reflect on the true impact they have through their repetition on a daily basis.
I have been accepted by a jury to exhibit at Espacio Mexico Gallery. The vernissage´s tentative dates are: 6th and 7th of December, 2012. I´m at the end of In-Visible´s post-production stage. Currently working on the portraits of men and women from Québec, Ethiopia, Estonia and Brazil among others. In order to reach a broader audience and keep In-Visible´s essence, I´m contacting newspapers in the attempt to include one of my images in their journal as an artwork meant for mass distribution.
The project will be exhibited at Espacio Mexico Gallery in Montréal for two months. The opening will be the 6th of December, 2012. The opening day I will also give place for women organizations to present themselves, creating stronger ties between community groups and the arts.

¿QUIÉN ES CERRUCHA?
CERRUCHA es una artista multidisciplinaria originaria de México D.F. Vive en Montréal, Canadá desde el año 2007 y su trabajo se basa tanto en fotografía como en instalación y video. Su ínterés se centra en la exploración del comportamiento humano, la construcción de la identidad y los preconceptos que existen dentro de los diversos grupos sociales. Su interés por establecer una conexión con el espectador a través del arte, crear una mayor consciencia social y hacer el arte más accesible al público en general la ha llevado a utilizar métodos alternos de representación como lo son sus intervenciones de arte públicas.

¿Y DE QUÉ TRATA EL PROYECTO “IN-VISIBLE”?
In-visible es una serie de fotografías que hace una crítica al machismo en México y cómo usamos el lenguaje para enseñárselo a las nuevas generaciones, creando una sociedad desigual. Los tatuajes que tienen las personas retratadas aquí, representan al machismo que se encuentra sutilmente escondido bajo las frases de uso cotidiano como lo son “Eres un mandilón”, “Todos los hombres son iguales”, “Ese juego no es para niñas”, etc., frases que van moldeando nuestra manera de pensar y que la repetición de ellas dan como resultado el que moldean el inconsciente colectivo a manera de perpetuar el machismo, que afecta tanto a hombres como mujeres y es el causante de la violencia de género en nuestro país.
El objetivo de ésta exposición es invitar a la gente a hacer una reflexión y auto-cuestionarse sobre el tema y cómo están participando en enseñarle a sus hijos e hijas a ser machistas a través del lenguaje.
¿UNA SEGUNDA FASE DE IN-VISIBLE?El 6 de Diciembre del 2012 tendé una exposición en el Espacio México, donde se exhibirán las nuevas imágenes de In-Visible, segunda Parte. Con el mismo concepto de explorar la perpetuación del machismo a través del lenguaje, retraté a 10 personas de diferentes partes del mundo, tatuándolo/as con frases en los idiomas de su país natal. Aprovechando la multiculturalidad de Montréal, en donde se tiene contacto con personas de todos los países del mundo de una manera cotidiana. 

¿PARA QUÉ SE USARAN LOS FONDOS RECAUDADOS?
Para hacer posible esta exposición, necesito de su ayuda para poder imprimir las fotografías, montarlas y terminar ésta última etapa del proyecto. 
A su derecha pueden ver los regalos que tengo para ustedes. Al apoyar mi proyecto, dependiendo de la cantidad de la aportación tengo dispuestos diferentes regalos. Los regalos son obra mia, fotografías originales y otras obras de arte. 
Les agradezco mucho su contribución para poder hacer del arte un instrumento para crear conciencia en nuestra sociedad. Pasen la voz con sus amigo/as por favor.
¡GRACIAS!

C´EST QUI CERRUCHA?
CERRUCHA est une artiste multidisciplinaire mexicaine, qui habite à Montréal, Canada depuis 2007. Son travail se base à la fois sur l'installation, la photographie et la vidéo. Son travail se concentre principalement sur l'exploration du comportement humain, la construction de l'identité et les préjugés qui existent au sein des divers groupes sociaux. Son souci d'établir une connexion avec le spectateur à travers l'art, en créant une plus grande conscience sociale et en rendant l'art plus accessible au grand public, l'a amenée à utiliser des moyens alternatifs de représentation comme des interventions d'art public.

C´EST QUOI LE PROJET IN-VISIBLE?
Dans In/Visible le machisme est inscrit dans le corps. Cerrucha utilise la pratique traditionnelle des tatouages pour lire l’histoire du machisme dans sa propre culture. D’étranges images mettant en scène la vulnérabilité des hommes, des femmes et des enfants avec des tatouages d’expressions communes stéréotypées qui dénigrent fortement les femmes, ou qui décrivent des pratiques qui sont socialement catégorisées comme féminines. Invisible donne à voir les paradoxes du langage dans la complexité de la chair. -Jake Moore
 
Je fais cette levée de fonds pour finir la 2eme phase de mon projet In-Visible, qui sera exposé à la Galerie Espace Mexique en décembre 2012. Il prend le même concept que la première phase, mais il devient multiculturel. J'ai profité du multi-culturalisme de Montréal pour inscrire des phrases sur des gens de plusieurs parties du monde (Turquie, Lebanon, Étiopie, etc) pour ainsi démontrer que cette situation est une problématique globale.Pour finir cette projet et l'exposer au l'Espacio Mexico ici à Montréal, j'ai besoin d'une somme de 1500$. Cette somme servira à imprimer les images et les préparer à l'exposition.SVP faites une contribution et aidez-moi à créer une conscience plus grande à travers l´art. À votre droit vous pouvez voir les avantages que j'ai pour vous à en échange de votre contribution. Choisissez une et en dépendent de votre contribution, je vous ferrez parvenir une des mes oeuvres d'art. Veuillez passer le mot à vos amis.
 
UN GROS MERCI! 
-------------------------------------------
ITALIANOPER TUTTI GLI AMICICI ITALIANIQuesto e' un progetto fotografico per mostrare l'esistenza del machismo nella nostra societa' e nel mondo attraverso il linguaggio di ogni giorno. Questa mostra fa vedere come le piccole parole di ogni giorno ormai a noi banali hanno un effetto negativo nella psiche della gente sia donne che uomini e specialmente nei bambini che cresceranno con l'idea che gli uomini sono meglio delle donne. Le frase tipo: ""questo non e' un gioco per bambine"" ""mio marito mi lasca lavorare"" le donne al volante sono un pericolo constante"" o addirittura ""sei peggio di una donna"" hanno un forte influsso negativo nel immagine di essere donna e aumentano di piu' l'idea della donna badante e uomo provveditore. Tutto ciò influisce negativamente la crescita dei bambini. Questa mostra e per combattere il machismo facendo vedere a tutti che le piccole frasi del genere anche se non gli si da' tanta importanza fanno un male constante. Prima ci si abitua alla parola in se, che poi diventa un pensiero indelebile, proprio come dei tatuaggi. Tatuaggi che portiamo addosso e avvolte neanche ci ricordiamo di averli, Infatti l'artista CERRUCHA (Claudia Espinosa), trasmette questo messaggio tramite l'arte della fotografia tatuando nel corpo dei modelli queste frasi, che proprio come dei tatuaggi ci si cresce insieme e ci si vive la quotidianità come se nulla fosse, come se questi pensieri non esistessero, ma che sono costantemente impresse nella pelle come nella mente, indelebili; proprio come i tatuaggi. Questa mostra e' la seconda fase di questo intero progetto, la prima e' già stata realizzata nel città del Messico, e ora qui a Montreal Canada; Ma abbiamo bisogno di raccogliere dei fondi per realizzare questa mostra, e i soldi raccolti serviranno per fare imprimere le immagini, ed e' proprio li che abbiamo bisogno del vostro aiuto. date ciò che potete, grazie. Potete vedere il link del progetto qui sotto. http://www.indiegogo.com/cerruchainvisible2",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<h3>Who we are and what we do</h3>
<p>We are MaDe Collective, an artist duo formed by Marie-Eve G. Castonguay and Devon Thom. We met through the artist residency program at Harbourfront Centre, in Toronto, where became not only studio mates, but also great friends with grand ideas!</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1505602710/qkqm8t8okddc9fpixrio.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>More than a year ago, we decided to invite Melanie Egan (Director or Craft and Design, Harbourfront Centre) and Paul McClure (internationally acclaimed artist and Jewellery Arts professor at George Brown College) to curate an exhibition that we would then propose for the official programming of Parcours Bijoux. Happening soon in Paris, France, Parcous Bijoux is a two-months long event entirely dedicated to contemporary jewellery from all over the world.</p>
<p>As our exhibition project was selected to be included in the official programming of Parcours Bijoux, we embarked on this glorious mission to promote Canadian contemporary jewellery internationally!</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Parcours Bijoux?</h3>
<p>A major international event, <a href=""https://parcoursbijoux.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Parcours Bijoux</a> 2017 will present over sixty projects, exhibitions and talks, bringing together artists, historians, collectors and jewellery lovers from numerous countries. Galleries, museums, cultural institutions and public spaces will be invested to display the multifaceted creativity that places jewellery simultaneously in a social, anthropological and aesthetic context.<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1505597995/fmjib2jhqy1p6ideecgg.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Our exhibition will take place at <a href=""http://galerieresidences.tumblr.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Galerie Résidences</a>, whose mission is specifically to promote contemporary jewellery. We were lucky to partner with this wonderful gallery, because the space itself will definitely be one the go-to places during the festival!</p>
<p> </p>
<div><h3>Impact</h3></div>
<div>
<p>The main goal of this exhibition is to promote Canadian art jewellery on an international level. We want the global art jewellery community to recognize Canada as an up and coming hub for contemporary jewellery design. The artists included in the exhibition - Micah Adams, Alex Kinsley, Amir Sheikhvand, Jan Smith, Kye-Yeon Son, Lawrence Woodford, Alice Yujing Yan, Patrycja Zwierzynska and ourselves - will all greatly benefit from the visibility of this exhibition and event, and we hope that it will be a chance for them to create new contacts and perhaps get new opportunities.</p>
<p>And in the grand scheme of things, we want people visiting the festival to realize how much great work is being made in Canada and to pay more attention to what is being created here!</p>
</div>
<p> </p>
<h3>What we need, how you can help, and how we thank you!</h3>

</div></div>","Who we are and what we do
We are MaDe Collective, an artist duo formed by Marie-Eve G. Castonguay and Devon Thom. We met through the artist residency program at Harbourfront Centre, in Toronto, where became not only studio mates, but also great friends with grand ideas!

More than a year ago, we decided to invite Melanie Egan (Director or Craft and Design, Harbourfront Centre) and Paul McClure (internationally acclaimed artist and Jewellery Arts professor at George Brown College) to curate an exhibition that we would then propose for the official programming of Parcours Bijoux. Happening soon in Paris, France, Parcous Bijoux is a two-months long event entirely dedicated to contemporary jewellery from all over the world.
As our exhibition project was selected to be included in the official programming of Parcours Bijoux, we embarked on this glorious mission to promote Canadian contemporary jewellery internationally!
 
Parcours Bijoux?
A major international event, Parcours Bijoux 2017 will present over sixty projects, exhibitions and talks, bringing together artists, historians, collectors and jewellery lovers from numerous countries. Galleries, museums, cultural institutions and public spaces will be invested to display the multifaceted creativity that places jewellery simultaneously in a social, anthropological and aesthetic context.
Our exhibition will take place at Galerie Résidences, whose mission is specifically to promote contemporary jewellery. We were lucky to partner with this wonderful gallery, because the space itself will definitely be one the go-to places during the festival!
 
Impact

The main goal of this exhibition is to promote Canadian art jewellery on an international level. We want the global art jewellery community to recognize Canada as an up and coming hub for contemporary jewellery design. The artists included in the exhibition - Micah Adams, Alex Kinsley, Amir Sheikhvand, Jan Smith, Kye-Yeon Son, Lawrence Woodford, Alice Yujing Yan, Patrycja Zwierzynska and ourselves - will all greatly benefit from the visibility of this exhibition and event, and we hope that it will be a chance for them to create new contacts and perhaps get new opportunities.
And in the grand scheme of things, we want people visiting the festival to realize how much great work is being made in Canada and to pay more attention to what is being created here!

 
What we need, how you can help, and how we thank you!
The money raised through this capaign will help us with covering the fees that are engendered by such a project: festival participation fee, gallery rental fee, insurance, transportation, marketing, installation, etc. And we of course need to go to Paris, to work full-time at a gallery for ten days..!
To thank you for your kind help, we have tons of great things to offer! Tote bags, jewellery, jewellery courses and workshops, and our love and gratitude!

Each design and art piece will be unique in that they will be of limited run. Once they're sold, that's it!</p><p>As a music advocate for the past 13 years my passion is music and art.

I want the future generations to have something positive to look forward to. </p><p>HOW WILL WE USE THE FUNDS: As a soon to be non-profit the money we make will be funneled back into the music and art programs in our local schools. We will do this by connecting with our local schools and teachers to find out the needs they need met and purchasing the necessary items they need to further the education of the students.

My name is Andrew. I have been a concert promoter in Salem for the past 13 years under the name 70x7 Productions. - For The Youth is a soon to be non-profit company striving to keep music and art in our local schools through the selling of merchandise (t-shirts, sweatshirts, stickers, CD's etc.) and the hosting of events and fundraisers. Each design and art piece will be unique in that they will be of limited run. Once they're sold, that's it!As a music advocate for the past 13 years my passion is music and art. I have seen the ups and downs throughout our community and the struggles and triumphs of what it takes to have a solid music and art scene. I want to be able to give back and build up that community. I want the future generations to have something positive to look forward to. HOW WILL WE USE THE FUNDS: As a soon to be non-profit the money we make will be funneled back into the music and art programs in our local schools. We will do this by connecting with our local schools and teachers to find out the needs they need met and purchasing the necessary items they need to further the education of the students. Once purchased, we as a company will take these items to the schools personally. - As a backer, your contributions will help stimulate and fund a need that is slowly being depleted in our community. Future generations will reap the benefits in (a)  huge way knowing that they have the options (and funding) to fulfill their dreams.What We Need & What You Get- We are looking to raise $10,000 within a 45 day time frame. The breakdown of funds goes as follows:1) $6,000 will go towards the first batch of t-shirts to be made. This includes the purchase of the t-shirts, paying the printers, getting the screens. Also included in this will be shipping costs. We will also be printing quality poster prints of each design for use to sell. 2) $2,000 wil go towards our advertising, ad time, promo needs such as fliers, website design. 3)  $1,000 will go towards legalities such as: Start up cost for non-profit licensing, copyright for designs and names.4) Remaining $1,000 will go towards our first contribution to a school in need. We would use this funding to launch awareness and provide a school with the supplies they desperately need. Lastly, if we do not fully reach our goal we will use the funds we have to make our first batch of shirts and the rest will be donated to a local school in need. The Impact- The impact and value that comes with helping us reach our goal is ten fold. Knowing that you will help change and enhance a youths life through art and music; to which they can take that into the rest of their lives. Second, having a unique piece of art either on a piece of clothing, on your car (bumper sticker), or hanging on your wall. Third, knowing that what you are doing will help others strive to reach their dreams and goals. This project will help impact so many lives in so many ways and will continue to do so with your support. Lastly, by contributing it will help launch FTY (For The Youth) and their passion into making even bigger dreams come true. Including: A fully funded art and music center, band and art camps, fully funded music scholarships and much much more. Other Ways You Can HelpNow, we know not everyone can contribute but contributing isn't all about money. You can help in other, very important ways too! - Liking and sharing us on Facebook (www.facebook.com/ftyclothing)- Sharing our indiegogo page with others. - Going to our events- Volunteering to hand out fliers, package shirts and other merchandise. - Talk about us in your community, schools, churches, coffee shops. So, Thank you all in advance! Let's make the future brighter one t-shirt at a time. *STRETCH FUNDING #1*- If we reach $12,000 we will release 3 new colors for you to choose from (green, pink, purple etc.)*STRETCH FUNDING #2*- If we reach $15,000 we will release 5 new colors. *STRETCH FUNDING #3*- If we reach $20,000 we will host a free block party event!",1.0,0,"1 Campaign
