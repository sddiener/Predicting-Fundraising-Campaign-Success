<h2>About the Project</h2>
<h3>The Plot</h3>
<p>Rose, 16, was up all night dealing with two equally annoying pests-- a horny boyfriend and a squeaking mouse that has somehow managed to climb into her bedroom ceiling. With her mother across the country attending a distant relative's funeral, Rose is home alone, and her boyfriend George is eager to capitalize on the opportunity. However, when Rose finds out that the mouse giving her a migraine scampered under her bed and ate a bag of her marijuana edibles, she and George must decide its fate.</p>
<h3>So... a mouse? (Director's Statement)</h3>
<p>In the first few months of quarantine, back when it felt more like a vacation from real life responsibilities (i.e. working late night shifts as a hostess) than a sentence to purgatory, I started reading a book I had bought at the Getty Museum in California a year prior. It was a modern translation of a medieval “bestiary”, a collection of encyclopedia-style entries about various real and fictional animals. The text itself was funny, bizarre, and at some points, very dark, and by the end of reading <i>The Bestiary</i> I felt compelled to write something about animals that dealt with death. You see, in these medieval entries, every animal had a Christ-like significance. They would die and resurrect, kill their pups—all of the sort of darkness you could expect from a text from such a bleak period in history. I started to write a radio play about rats. I figured if I finished the script by June 2020, I’d be able to record all the parts before the academic year began.</p>
<p>Quarantine, however, ended up far more eventful than I could have ever anticipated, and the idea was scrapped during the June protests that swept the nation. I was very disappointed to begin the semester without a quarantine project under my belt. And I was even more disappointed to have never written something quirky about rats. </p>
<p>Ultimately, this became the generative idea for <i>Mercy for the Meek</i>—I traded gritty sewer rats for docile mice, and decided to craft a story that dealt with very serious issues around a drama that I could more easily wrap my 20-year-old head around: teenage hormones.  The conceit of <i>Mercy for the Meek</i> is that it’s a comedy surrounded by bleakness and awfulness (which I think is timely). Much like the medieval texts I read, the subject matter is at times dark, but (also like the medieval texts I read) the presentation of all this absurdity and terror is funny. </p>
<p>Right before I began to write the second draft of this script, I was forced to put down my family dog of fifteen years. It was an intense experience to watch the eyes of an animal as it dies—especially one that I loved dearly. But it is an experience that, as a human on the precipice of true adulthood, I am happy to have had. Because I think it taught me, on a base level, the preciousness and fragility of life, and how much power I have as a person with opposable thumbs. In <i>Mercy for the Meek</i>, Rose comes to a similar realization. I hope that when you watch this short film this human tenderness—above all the bleakness and dark comedy— moves you as much as it moves me.</p>

 RISKS & CHALLENGES
Regardless of experience and resources, unforeseen obstacles do emerge and can potentially hamper momentum and activities.

<li>Six-episode documentary series about Classic Tetris champions competing at the Classic Tetris World Championship.</li>
<li>Includes extensive interviews + HD remastered gameplay footage with brand-new commentary by Chris Tang and James Chen.</li>
<li>Brought to you by the team behind CTWC, <i>Ecstasy of Order: The Tetris Masters</i>, and other Classic Tetris stuff!</li>
</ul><h3> </h3><h3>Here's My Story</h3><p>In the months before the 2014 Classic Tetris World Championship, I (Chris Higgins) began filming a sequel to the documentary <a href=""http://watch.ecstasyoforder.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><i>Ecstasy of Order: The Tetris Masters</i></a>. (I worked on <i>EOO</i> as a writer.) 2014 was the fifth annual CTWC, and I interviewed key players before, during, and after the competition to learn what Classic Tetris meant to them. I made a film about how the Classic Tetris scene had changed in the years since EOO.</p><p>Filming continued through late 2015 in Oregon, California, and Europe. There was even some footage captured in 2016 as I continued to fill in gaps. I ended up with a massive project that couldn't really fit in the 90-minute format I originally planned on. I had hours of championship gameplay footage alone—not to mention dozens of interviews with players and experts. I continued to work on it around the edges for several years, but focused on other projects as I tried to figure out how to complete this movie.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1607564679/uk08are0sovaku8mqnd9.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><i>Terry Purcell plays his then-beloved controller ""Turd"" during the championship.</i></p><p>When the pandemic struck in March 2020, I found myself suddenly unemployed. I was working as a portrait photographer, which wasn't a high-demand job during lockdown.</p><p>So I spoke with my friend Gilbert Tang, and he proposed a clear solution: <strong>This should be a <i>documentary series</i>. If we released it online to backers, there would be no need to cut it down to 90 minutes for a theatrical release.</strong> We would just make the episodes and release them as they were done.</p><p>I also believe it's vital to add new game commentary from both Chris Tang and James Chen.

When new episodes come out, you get an email and can log in to watch them. I anticipate six episodes, with the first one coming out by April 2021.</p><p><strong>DIGITAL ADD-ON: Director's Commentary Streams</strong> — Taking a page from <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLqs5ohhass_Ti_MyDhtRvw59GgGKcdstB"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">CGP Grey</a>, I'll do live streams after each episode comes out. Tuning in to the live (or recorded) stream will require a secret link that you can only get if you've backed the appropriate level. Anyway, the stream involves me playing the episode, showing you the editing process, and bringing in special guests to talk about key moments and answering questions from y'all. If you're interested in behind-the-scenes stuff, or you just want to ask questions about the episode, this is for you. (Note: This add-on is available for every tier once you select your main reward. All the higher-priced reward tiers have it included, along with the series.)</p><p><strong>DIGITAL ADD-ON: Original Soundtrack</strong> — Download the original soundtrack by Carl King! If you like Tetris music, this is for you. Carl wrote and performed all the music you hear in the video for this project, and that's just the beginning.</p><p><strong>PHYSICAL ADD-ON: Stickers</strong> — This is a <strong>six-pack</strong> of vinyl stickers. They will come in various sizes, all with original designs related to the movie. I'm trying to keep them small enough to ship in a regular envelope, so expect most of these to be in the 3x3 inch size or thereabouts. I'll share designs as they're made.</p><p><strong>PHYSICAL ADD-ON: Original Polaroid from the Editing Suite</strong> — An original Polaroid photo taken by Director Chris Higgins. Each is unique, and will document some aspect of editing the film. All are taken on original Polaroid SX-70 cameras, and will have flaws common to Polaroids—the film might be a little messed up, focus might be slightly off, and so on. Have a piece of original art for not much money! Below are a few examples taken over the past few months. These are images taken at Chris's desk. (Chris also runs the <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/jamielivingstonpod/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Instagram account for Jamie Livingston</a>, who was one of the most noteworthy Polaroid photographers of the 20th century!)</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1607564239/adpegsxzlyfqjyw7xcyd.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><i>Polaroid examples - a sealed ecosystem on Chris's desk (w/headphones), an early Instagram design, and a color-checker exposure test</i></p><p><strong>REWARD: Movie Poster</strong> — An 18x24 inch movie poster, signed by the Director, suitable for framing or hanging up in your dorm room. Keep in mind that this is <i>smaller</i> than the giant movie posters you see at movie theaters, but it's still a nice medium-sized poster printed on high-quality paper in full color. I'm still working with our designer on the imagery, but, you know, it'll look like a movie poster for a Classic Tetris documentary.</p><p><strong>REWARD: Blu-ray</strong> — A 1080p (HD) Blu-ray Disc with the full series, with the box signed by the Director. This includes subtitles (in whatever languages I have by the time the disc is made) as well as Audio Description in English. If you like collectibles and/or Blu-ray Discs, well, this is your thing. Note that this one arrives very late because it is the last thing I'll make for this series. Also note that this might have to turn into two discs, depending on the length of the episodes. I think I can cram it onto one disc, but I have budgeted for the possibility of it being a two-disc set. If that happens, y'all get that upgrade for free.</p><p><strong>REWARD: Classic Gaming Photo Book</strong> — As I mentioned above, I've worked as a photographer for years. There were actually several years I covered the Portland Retro Gaming Expo (home to the Classic Tetris World Championship) doing photo essays for <i>Mental Floss</i> magazine. I have a ton of photos from over the years at retro gaming expos, CTWCs, and during the filming of this series. I'll pick out the best ones and make a nice, hardbound book of them (rough page count—probably 30-ish, double sided printing). Because these books are costly to make and ship, this will be a very limited edition reward. And yes, I will sign and number them.</p><p><strong>REWARD: Chris Higgins Helps You</strong> — I do a lot of stuff, much of which you can find <a href=""https://chrishiggins.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">on my website</a>. You get four hours of my time online for whatever (legal and morally acceptable) purpose we agree on. I'll give a talk for your company or group, I'll do consulting work, I'll fix your podcast's weird audio problem, or I'll just talk and hang out. Note that if you are in Portland, Oregon we may be able to do this in person, with safety protocols.</p><p><strong>REWARD: Associate &amp; Executive Producer Credits</strong> — You will actually join the team at these levels. Your name will be in the credits as an AP or EP, including the movie's IMDB page. (By the way, <a href=""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm5396536/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here's my IMDB page</a>.) I will include you on internal team updates and show you rough cuts, ask for your input, and consider what you think as we shape each episode, and the series as a whole. If you've ever wanted to be a movie producer, well, here's your chance!</p><p> </p><h3>About Time, HD, and Treyvision</h3><p>A big aspect of this documentary series is watching Classic Tetris gameplay in the tournament. If you've ever watched the tournament on the <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-8BAEcWSEs4-KQp1ULVnaQ"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Classic Tetris YouTube channel</a>, you know what that looks like: two Tetris games, side-by-side, in HD. That way of viewing the game includes live statistics (including a ""drought counter"" that tells you how long it has been since the last long bar) and a score differential. The system is sometimes called ""Treyvision"" after its inventor, Producer Trey Harrison.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1607564084/fuypvpcgqgtkzyoagdoo.png"" src=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><i>A match rendered in HD Trevision for this series.</i></p><p>So why am I talking about this? Well, I filmed the tournament in 2014. Treyvision was invented after this movie was filmed. We did not have that technology in the old days. Back then, you just saw two TV screens projected on a big screen. No clean HD graphics, no statistics, no drought counter, no nothing. If the commentator wanted to know the score difference, they had to do math. What I had after wrapping production was very small, fuzzy recordings of each TV. (The interviews and stuff are all filmed in beautiful fancy HD, but the Nintendo outputs were not.)</p><p>At the very beginning of the pandemic lockdown, I reached out to Trey about his Treyvision system, hoping he could use it to render key games and matches in that HD format using the poor-quality recordings I had. He could, but it was extremely difficult. This was a heroic effort by Producer Trey, because he was working with source material that was deeply low-quality (classic ""postage stamp video"" complete with analog glitches and digital glitches in the source files). After Trey created the HD versions, there were still a variety of digital errors due to glitches in the source recordings. <strong>As Director, I went through each game frame by frame, spotting and painting out the glitches by hand. </strong>This is a big part of why preparing the footage has taken so long.</p><p> </p><h3>Accessibility and Closed Captions</h3><p>I have a firm commitment to <a href=""https://accessmovie.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">making all films accessible</a> to people with disabilities. Every episode of this series will arrive with Closed Captions and Audio Description in English—at a minimum.</p><p>I'm looking for translators to help with Closed Captions in languages other than English. If you have experience with this process, please <a href=""https://chrishiggins.com/w/contact-chris-higgins/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">get in touch</a> (especially if you know Tetris well—that should help with the translation process). Translation of captions is paid work. Note that I will not use or accept machine translation—I need humans to do this.

Six-episode documentary series about Classic Tetris champions competing at the Classic Tetris World Championship.
Includes extensive interviews + HD remastered gameplay footage with brand-new commentary by Chris Tang and James Chen.
Brought to you by the team behind CTWC, Ecstasy of Order: The Tetris Masters, and other Classic Tetris stuff!
 Here's My StoryIn the months before the 2014 Classic Tetris World Championship, I (Chris Higgins) began filming a sequel to the documentary Ecstasy of Order: The Tetris Masters. (I worked on EOO as a writer.) 2014 was the fifth annual CTWC, and I interviewed key players before, during, and after the competition to learn what Classic Tetris meant to them. I made a film about how the Classic Tetris scene had changed in the years since EOO.Filming continued through late 2015 in Oregon, California, and Europe. There was even some footage captured in 2016 as I continued to fill in gaps. I ended up with a massive project that couldn't really fit in the 90-minute format I originally planned on. I had hours of championship gameplay footage alone—not to mention dozens of interviews with players and experts. I continued to work on it around the edges for several years, but focused on other projects as I tried to figure out how to complete this movie.Terry Purcell plays his then-beloved controller ""Turd"" during the championship.When the pandemic struck in March 2020, I found myself suddenly unemployed. I was working as a portrait photographer, which wasn't a high-demand job during lockdown.So I spoke with my friend Gilbert Tang, and he proposed a clear solution: This should be a documentary series. If we released it online to backers, there would be no need to cut it down to 90 minutes for a theatrical release. We would just make the episodes and release them as they were done.I also believe it's vital to add new game commentary from both Chris Tang and James Chen. (Tang was the lone commentator back in 2014.) They are onboard to record brand-new commentary for this series! The TeamChris Higgins (Director) - I'm a writer, podcaster, and filmmaker. I make my living telling true stories. You might know me from my reporting on This American Life (that was later adapted into a movie), my writing for Mental Floss magazine, my work writing and hosting the Election Ride Home podcast, my books, or whatever. I directed this movie, plus served in the camera and sound departments.Carl King (Editor & Original Score) - In the progressive rock world, Carl King has released albums under the names Sir Millard Mulch and Dr. Zoltan. He’s made music with Dweezil Zappa, Virgil Donati, Mike Keneally, Marco Minnemann, Travis Orbin, and others. His triple-CD concept album, HOW TO SELL THE WHOLE F#@!ING UNIVERSE TO EVERYBODY, ONCE AND FOR ALL! was co-released on Mimicry Records owned by Trey Spruance of Mr. Bungle. His favorite composers are Prokofiev, Stravinsky, and John Williams. Adam Cornelius, Vince Clemente, Trey Harrison (Producers) - The core team behind both the Classic Tetris World Championship (CTWC) itself and the previous Classic Tetris documentary, Ecstasy of Order, all worked on this project. Vince helped set up access to the event. Adam helped edit and organize footage. Trey digitized gameplay footage using his ""Treyvision"" system, turning fuzzy TV recordings into HD gameplay (more on that below).Josh Boykin (Narrator) - Josh Boykin is a game critic, streamer, narrator, and speaker who focuses on storytelling and narrative in games. As the Founder of Intelligame, he builds community around discussing all kinds of games and the connections players can make with the real world. He also carries a very pure, very strong love for Tetris Effect. You can find him on Twitter and you can find Intelligame on Twitter, Twitch, and Patreon.Chris Tang, James Chen (Commentators) - Chris Tang and James Chen have been part of the CTWC commentary team in recent years. Chen is a historian, advocate, and commentator for the Fighting Game Community. Tang is a game designer, eSports commentator, and recently appleared in the Netflix documentary High Score. He also coined the phrase ""Boom! Tetris!""Lucy Bellwood (Audio Description Narrator) - Lucy Bellwood is a professional Adventure Cartoonist, author, and educator based in Portland, Oregon. Her work brings enthusiastic tales of exploration to thousands of readers online, in print, and in person. About the RewardsWhat if you don't ship to my country? I have set up shipping to 22 countries based on our understanding of the demographics of the CTWC player base and viewership—but I'm sure I have missed some! If your country isn't listed, please leave a comment and I will add it (unless there is some legal or other reason I simply cannot get there from here). You can also email Chris directly if you have questions or concerns.A classic CTWC shirt appears!REWARD: The Series — You'll be able to access a stream of the series, episode by episode, as it is released. How it works: You get a special code via email that lets you make a (free) account on the streaming service and grab new episodes (or old ones you may have missed). When new episodes come out, you get an email and can log in to watch them. I anticipate six episodes, with the first one coming out by April 2021.DIGITAL ADD-ON: Director's Commentary Streams — Taking a page from CGP Grey, I'll do live streams after each episode comes out. Tuning in to the live (or recorded) stream will require a secret link that you can only get if you've backed the appropriate level. Anyway, the stream involves me playing the episode, showing you the editing process, and bringing in special guests to talk about key moments and answering questions from y'all. If you're interested in behind-the-scenes stuff, or you just want to ask questions about the episode, this is for you. (Note: This add-on is available for every tier once you select your main reward. All the higher-priced reward tiers have it included, along with the series.)DIGITAL ADD-ON: Original Soundtrack — Download the original soundtrack by Carl King! If you like Tetris music, this is for you. Carl wrote and performed all the music you hear in the video for this project, and that's just the beginning.PHYSICAL ADD-ON: Stickers — This is a six-pack of vinyl stickers. They will come in various sizes, all with original designs related to the movie. I'm trying to keep them small enough to ship in a regular envelope, so expect most of these to be in the 3x3 inch size or thereabouts. I'll share designs as they're made.PHYSICAL ADD-ON: Original Polaroid from the Editing Suite — An original Polaroid photo taken by Director Chris Higgins. Each is unique, and will document some aspect of editing the film. All are taken on original Polaroid SX-70 cameras, and will have flaws common to Polaroids—the film might be a little messed up, focus might be slightly off, and so on. Have a piece of original art for not much money! Below are a few examples taken over the past few months. These are images taken at Chris's desk. (Chris also runs the Instagram account for Jamie Livingston, who was one of the most noteworthy Polaroid photographers of the 20th century!)Polaroid examples - a sealed ecosystem on Chris's desk (w/headphones), an early Instagram design, and a color-checker exposure testREWARD: Movie Poster — An 18x24 inch movie poster, signed by the Director, suitable for framing or hanging up in your dorm room. Keep in mind that this is smaller than the giant movie posters you see at movie theaters, but it's still a nice medium-sized poster printed on high-quality paper in full color. I'm still working with our designer on the imagery, but, you know, it'll look like a movie poster for a Classic Tetris documentary.REWARD: Blu-ray — A 1080p (HD) Blu-ray Disc with the full series, with the box signed by the Director. This includes subtitles (in whatever languages I have by the time the disc is made) as well as Audio Description in English. If you like collectibles and/or Blu-ray Discs, well, this is your thing. Note that this one arrives very late because it is the last thing I'll make for this series. Also note that this might have to turn into two discs, depending on the length of the episodes. I think I can cram it onto one disc, but I have budgeted for the possibility of it being a two-disc set. If that happens, y'all get that upgrade for free.REWARD: Classic Gaming Photo Book — As I mentioned above, I've worked as a photographer for years. There were actually several years I covered the Portland Retro Gaming Expo (home to the Classic Tetris World Championship) doing photo essays for Mental Floss magazine. I have a ton of photos from over the years at retro gaming expos, CTWCs, and during the filming of this series. I'll pick out the best ones and make a nice, hardbound book of them (rough page count—probably 30-ish, double sided printing). Because these books are costly to make and ship, this will be a very limited edition reward. And yes, I will sign and number them.REWARD: Chris Higgins Helps You — I do a lot of stuff, much of which you can find on my website. You get four hours of my time online for whatever (legal and morally acceptable) purpose we agree on. I'll give a talk for your company or group, I'll do consulting work, I'll fix your podcast's weird audio problem, or I'll just talk and hang out. Note that if you are in Portland, Oregon we may be able to do this in person, with safety protocols.REWARD: Associate & Executive Producer Credits — You will actually join the team at these levels. Your name will be in the credits as an AP or EP, including the movie's IMDB page. (By the way, here's my IMDB page.) I will include you on internal team updates and show you rough cuts, ask for your input, and consider what you think as we shape each episode, and the series as a whole. If you've ever wanted to be a movie producer, well, here's your chance! About Time, HD, and TreyvisionA big aspect of this documentary series is watching Classic Tetris gameplay in the tournament. If you've ever watched the tournament on the Classic Tetris YouTube channel, you know what that looks like: two Tetris games, side-by-side, in HD. That way of viewing the game includes live statistics (including a ""drought counter"" that tells you how long it has been since the last long bar) and a score differential. The system is sometimes called ""Treyvision"" after its inventor, Producer Trey Harrison.A match rendered in HD Trevision for this series.So why am I talking about this? Well, I filmed the tournament in 2014. Treyvision was invented after this movie was filmed. We did not have that technology in the old days. Back then, you just saw two TV screens projected on a big screen. No clean HD graphics, no statistics, no drought counter, no nothing. If the commentator wanted to know the score difference, they had to do math. What I had after wrapping production was very small, fuzzy recordings of each TV. (The interviews and stuff are all filmed in beautiful fancy HD, but the Nintendo outputs were not.)At the very beginning of the pandemic lockdown, I reached out to Trey about his Treyvision system, hoping he could use it to render key games and matches in that HD format using the poor-quality recordings I had. He could, but it was extremely difficult. This was a heroic effort by Producer Trey, because he was working with source material that was deeply low-quality (classic ""postage stamp video"" complete with analog glitches and digital glitches in the source files). After Trey created the HD versions, there were still a variety of digital errors due to glitches in the source recordings. As Director, I went through each game frame by frame, spotting and painting out the glitches by hand. This is a big part of why preparing the footage has taken so long. Accessibility and Closed CaptionsI have a firm commitment to making all films accessible to people with disabilities. Every episode of this series will arrive with Closed Captions and Audio Description in English—at a minimum.I'm looking for translators to help with Closed Captions in languages other than English. If you have experience with this process, please get in touch (especially if you know Tetris well—that should help with the translation process). Translation of captions is paid work. Note that I will not use or accept machine translation—I need humans to do this. I'd love to deliver each episode with a variety of Closed Caption tracks to reflect the worldwide community of Classic Tetris fans—but I need your help to make that happen. How the Budget WorksA player reaches Level 29 during qualifying.Anyway, without getting into the specific dollar amounts, the big cost categories for this project are (in this order):Editing — the process of reviewing hundreds of hours of footage and cutting together sequences.

<h3>Story Summary</h3>
<p>In this gritty thriller, we spend the night with <strong>AMARIS</strong> -- young, softspoken, and 5 months pregnant -- and her manipulative boyfriend, <strong>RAFA</strong>, who tests her loyalty after forcing her to go on the run.</p>
<p><strong><i>Impulso</i></strong> dives into the complexities of loving someone deeply while also being afraid to be around them. Amidst this conflict, Amaris must also think about a new life: her baby, and the family they can all become together. Set against the backdrop of an abusive relationship and gang violence, this film will highlight the pressures that face impoverished BIPOC individuals, as well as <u>the curse of generational trauma</u>, by following this family's horrific night.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Our goal is to raise <strong>$1,600 </strong>in order to meet the basic demands of our production. This includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>PRODUCTION DESIGN - Part of bringing our story to life in the most authentic way possible is creating the look of everything you see on screen. Our story takes place in the 2000s, so everything from our costumes to the type of car our characters drive is important in bringing the world to life on screen.</li>
<li>EQUIPMENT - We have an incredible team of filmmakers and we want to give them the best tools possible to create the most visually captivating film. This includes lenses, lighting, and other camera equipment to make our film as visually pleasing for our audience as possible.</li>
<li>CRAFT SERVICES - Our crew is a dedicated team of student filmmakers volunteering their time because they believe in this story. It is standard practice to provide one meal each shooting day to our amazing crew to make sure everyone is healthy and has the energy to create an incredible film.</li>
<li>ACTOR FEES - We strive to find the best talent possible to bring our characters alive. We plan on paying our actors and feel it is incredibly important to do so -- especially now, considering how the arts community has been impacted by the COVID pandemic.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you're considering donating: thank you!!! </p>
<ul><li>We have some exciting perks to thank our donors! Just a few of the options you can choose from are: digital poster downloads, advanced screenings, and even Executive Producer credit. Check out the ""Perks"" section for a full list of offerings!</li></ul>
<p>If we don't reach our fundraising goal, our production quality would drop significantly. We would never compromise feeding our team properly, nor paying our actors who need the support more than ever during these difficult times -- therefore, every dollar we don't make in our goal simply detracts from the vision our team's created for this intense, heartfelt story.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Growing up in Chicago, I understand how impoverished Black, Indigenous, and People of Color tend to fall for the opportunities that gangs and criminal lifestyles provide. With the level of neglect and support from our own government, it can seem like the best option. Inevitably, however, these individuals suffer as a result -- along with their loved ones in many tragic cases. Through my filmmaking, and particularly through <strong><i>Impulso</i></strong>, I want to explore the lives of individuals facing these pressures while also acknowledging the impact of individual's choices.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Our timeline is tight -- but with a script that I've been envisioning since last summer (and has minimal production demands), I have no doubt we'll be ready to roll if we meet our goal within our campaign length.</p>
<p>COVID-19 is a permanent concern, even with vaccines being distributed.  Our project, however, has a very small cast; there are only ever two people directly interacting in any given scene. In addition, our team members have had extensive experience producing films throughout the pandemic. We know the risk, but we also know how to minimize it as best we can.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>SHARING IS CARING! No, seriously. Even if you're not in a position to make a donation, spreading the word about this project and supporting our vision through social media traction will help expand the campaign's reach significantly.

<p>I’ve always been fascinated by Alex Jones. His ability to make such outrageous claims and still maintain a loyal audience blows my mind. Since my freshman year of college, I've wanted to make an Alex Jones origin story; a fictional explanation for this larger-than-life personality (Anakin in the Star Wars prequels but Alex Jones.) Instantly, the comedic potential was clear, but when I started writing, I found an opportunity to comment on modern-day journalism in America.</p>
<p>As I started developing the concept, I decided that the best way to capture the spirit of Alex Jones was through a musical! Alex is charismatic and over the top in nature, what's a better way to express that than through song? The musical style combines a 90's alt-rock sound with the epic-ness of rock musicals like ""Tommy"" and ""Rocky Horror.""</p>
<p>For most of Jones’ career, he was known for his outrageous, but mostly harmless conspiracy theories. It wasn’t until he denied the Sandy Hook tragedy and obsessed over “Pizza-Gate” that his listeners took real-world actions, resulting in devastating consequences. I think Alex Jones is a cautionary tale for the dangers of competitive journalism. That’s why I want to tell this story. I believe this musical showcases the moral dilemma that many people with influence face: “Should I sacrifice what is right for an opportunity that could save my career?” For people like Alex Jones, that question is all too easy to answer.  <br/>                                                                                                                  -Dru Miers (Director/Composer) </p>

<p>We have wrapped on production! Now we need your help to cross the finish line! Your donation will help us with all the post-production expenses needed to get the film ready for festivals. These expenses include paying a professional sound designer/mixer, an orchestrator, VFX artists, and all film festival entry fees. </p>
<p><u><strong>Professional Sound Design/Mix</strong></u></p>
<p>Sound is important in any film, but it’s really important in a musical. Having a professional sound mix will help showcase the amazing live vocals captured on set and create a soundscape that brings the entire film together. </p>
<p><strong><u>Orchestration/Accompaniment</u></strong></p>
<p>We plan to record a live brass section to accompany the existing musical numbers. This requires paying a producer, musicians, and a studio space to record the additional instruments. </p>
<p><strong><u>VFX</u></strong></p>
<p>In order to really sell that this films takes place in 1995, we need the ""public access"" footage from Alex’s show to appear authentic and fit in with the mid-90’s aesthetic.</p>
<p><strong><u>Film Festival Entries</u></strong></p>
<p>Last and certainly not least, your donation will go towards the pricey film festival entry fees. We believe this film could do very well in many festivals across Texas and the US. Because of the potential for the film to receive notoriety, we want to get it out to as many festivals as possible and we can’t do it without your help.</p>

It wasn’t until he denied the Sandy Hook tragedy and obsessed over “Pizza-Gate” that his listeners took real-world actions, resulting in devastating consequences. I think Alex Jones is a cautionary tale for the dangers of competitive journalism. That’s why I want to tell this story. I believe this musical showcases the moral dilemma that many people with influence face: “Should I sacrifice what is right for an opportunity that could save my career?” For people like Alex Jones, that question is all too easy to answer.                                                                                                                    -Dru Miers (Director/Composer) 
   

    
We have wrapped on production! Now we need your help to cross the finish line! Your donation will help us with all the post-production expenses needed to get the film ready for festivals. These expenses include paying a professional sound designer/mixer, an orchestrator, VFX artists, and all film festival entry fees. 
Professional Sound Design/Mix
Sound is important in any film, but it’s really important in a musical. Having a professional sound mix will help showcase the amazing live vocals captured on set and create a soundscape that brings the entire film together. 
Orchestration/Accompaniment
We plan to record a live brass section to accompany the existing musical numbers. This requires paying a producer, musicians, and a studio space to record the additional instruments. 
VFX
In order to really sell that this films takes place in 1995, we need the ""public access"" footage from Alex’s show to appear authentic and fit in with the mid-90’s aesthetic.
Film Festival Entries
Last and certainly not least, your donation will go towards the pricey film festival entry fees. We believe this film could do very well in many festivals across Texas and the US. Because of the potential for the film to receive notoriety, we want to get it out to as many festivals as possible and we can’t do it without your help.

<strong>Michel Dessources, Jr (Co- Director/ Director of Photography).</strong> is a native Haitian born and 
raised in Port-au-Prince, Haiti. Growing up as a young boy he was 
exposed to the arts. His father worked as a craft artist and his mother 
as a stage performing actress. Michel, having spent much quality time 
with his parents in and out of the home, developed an appetite for film 
and production. Subsequently, Michel attended Rockland Community College
 in Rockland County, New York where he received an Associates Degree in 
the Visual Arts. He went on to continue his studies at the Katherine 
Gibbs School of the Arts in New York City where he received his Bachelor
 of Arts degree in Visual Communications. He has since become a 
Photographer, a Graphic Designer and a Filmmaker. As a result of 
fulfilling his heartfelt passion for the arts through formalized 
education and training, Michel has received much notoriety in his brief 
career through the following assignments: Art Director with actor Danny 
Glover in 2004 at the Lincoln Center, Manhattan, New York. Art 
Director/Set Design for “Pluie d’Espoir” a movie directed by Jacques 
Roc. Director of a short documentary for the Bill Brookman Foundation, 
“UK,” and, last but not least, Art Director for Sensitization Projects 
for BDR/United Nations in Haiti. While all these are notable 
accomplishments, growing up in the streets of Port-au-Prince, Haiti 
exposed Michel to much more than the arts. He witnessed horror as a 
child observing the conditions of his native people. In the midst of 
this beautiful island tucked away in the Caribbean, Michel observed 
poverty and sickness to great magnitudes. He saw thousands of homeless 
people in the streets; sickness and disease that plagued the bodies of 
many; the hopelessness and despair of children with little to no formal 
educational opportunities; and of course, he witnessed the atrocious 
sexual and physical abuse of children that continues to burden his heart
 to this very day. As a result, through God’s guidance and covering, 
Michel has chosen to use film as his primary medium for sharing these 
dramatic, yet real images of life in his country with the world. After a
 number of years of wrestling and contemplating the idea, he is finally 
launching out; making strategic strides towards acquiring the necessary 
resources needed to secure his country in the same spiritual peace, 
educational freedom, and economic stability experienced by other nations
 throughout the world!<br/><br/><strong>Oja Vincent</strong>, better known as DJ Oja, is a producer, DJ, educator and activist whose life work is to

New York City. He also has taught semester-long media arts classes such 
as “So You Want To Be a DJ?” at Urban Arts Initiative, “Electronic Music
 Production 1.0” class at P.S.27 and “Beat Making 101” at P.S.15 (as a 
part of the Good Shepherd Summer Camp Program). Recently, Oja has been 
the coordinator/facilitator of The Red Hook Initiative’s “RHI Radio,” a

for everything from live theatre performances (“Tongan Paint,” at Terra 
Nova Festival, “Osage Avenue” at Cherry Lane Theater & “Committing 
The Black On Black Crime Called Blackface,” sponsored by La Mama), 
fundraisers (for the people of Palestine, Hispaniola, Chiapas, ect.), 
live musical performances (3BB, Toni Blackman, Nemiss, DAM, Metrosonics 
& Brwn Bflo) festivals and conferences (CR10, USSJF2007, Red Hook 
Waterfront Festival, Clear Creek Festival), sound for Television and 
films (Sesame Street’s “Z is for Zipper,” PBS’s In the Mix series’ “Get 
the News?” “Dealing With Differences,” “Living With Change,” and “9-11: 
Looking Back….Moving Forward”) and co-producing two tracks from the 
soundtrack of Southeast Emmy winning Thorton Dial documentary “Mr. Dial 
Has Something to Say” to radio programs (89.1FM’s “The Subterrain” &
 “The Hip Hop Shop,” PNC radio’s “Show ‘n’ Prove” & WBMB 87.9FM’s 
“Homecookin” & “Pangea Radio”) and sound installations accompanying 
visual art (“Housing is a Human Right” with oral historians & 
photographers Mike Premo & Rachel Falcone and painter Leonardo 
Benzant’s exhibit “A Presence Under the Noise”). As an educator and 
program producer, Oja coordinated, developed curriculum (audio 
production and DJ instruction), and taught youth at the City Parks 
Foundation’s first ever free after school technology initiative program,
 Hook Productions, in Red Hook Brooklyn from February 2004 to September 
of 2008. The program has since been replicated at several sites around 
New York City. He also has taught semester-long media arts classes such 
as “So You Want To Be a DJ?” at Urban Arts Initiative, “Electronic Music
 Production 1.0” class at P.S.27 and “Beat Making 101” at P.S.15 (as a 
part of the Good Shepherd Summer Camp Program). Recently, Oja has been 
the coordinator/facilitator of The Red Hook Initiative’s “RHI Radio,” a 
youth produced radio program in Red Hook (www.rhicenter.org/rhiradio), 
helping get Red Hook’s youth-produced started with the eager teens from 
the Red Hook Initiative through out the school year and producing the 
First RHI Youth Radio Conference this summer. Presently, he continues to
 work to document, produce, collaborate, create and perform alongside 
like-minded artists in order to help tell untold stories, construct 
environments and inspire thought, dialog and action through sound. In 
addition, Oja has been using his community building and media arts 
skills to work with two partners to get their new non-profit 
organization, Lend a Hand and Foot (www.LAHAF.org) off the ground in 
efforts to aid the people of Haiti to build a new nation.

What is ""Wa""? Wa (和) is a Japanese cultural concept usually translated into English as ""team harmony"", some say it is one of the most fundamental concepts of Japan's moral system. The concept of Wa is fundamental in the practice of Kendo. 
It implies a peaceful unity and conformity within a group, in which members prefer the continuation of a harmonious community over their personal interests.
What is a ""Webumentary"" ? It is similar to a TV documentary, however, not in the traditional documentary sense. The video will be a series of 8 episodes released online via social networks and online groups. Hence, this makes it a ""webumentary"". 




What is Kendo? 
Kendo, the Japanese ""way of the sword"", is a very powerful visual medium. Kendo is steeped in history and tradition and is a joy to watch, the world championship team events are exciting to say the least. It takes years of dedication and training to perform at this level. 
The All Japan Kendo Federation (AJKF) estimates that the number of ""kendoka"" in Japan is 1.66 million, with over 6 million practitioners worldwide, 


Why is it being made? 
We believe this video project will help promote the practice of Kendo globally.
We strongly believe this video project will contribute to the development of culture and promote peace and prosperity among all people.Kendo practitioners all around the world already experience and foster a sense of ""Wa"", a peaceful unity within the global Kendo community, this helps kendo to grow. The kendo community around the world is one of peace and friendships. Thank you for reading. Thank you for being involved.

This is where we really need your help. We are asking for $100,000.00 in funding to produce a pilot to shop to networks. (Believe it or not, that's not a lot as film budgets go; every penny is necessary.) </p>
</div><div>
This money goes toward several things, including but not limited to:</div><div>
Actor compensation - ""the Talent,"" as we call them on set. They're the ones with the ability to make the entire project believable and successful.They are, of course, absolutely necessary and they don't always come cheap. </div><div>On set food - whether it's craft services or catering, food on set is extremely important to both the actors and the crew. If the food is bad, the crew will be unmotivated and sluggish, and the actors will be on edge. Good food creates good atmosphere, which exponentially increases the quality on set. We try to have craft services on set, as well as attempting to adhere to union standards of a hot meal every six hours.</div><div>Locations - Location, location, location! Every film, every business, needs a good location. For us, it's a place that can fit precisely the look we need to build the Waiting Line universe. These places exist, and are usually available, but they do cost money.</div><div>Crew pay - Technicians on film crews are freelance, and their jobs are hard and unforgiving. They don't come cheap, and they're the ones who make the motor run. Without them, nothing in the filmworld happens. Topnotch professionals assure top quality work.</div><div>Equipment - Easily accounting for 40% of our budget. Top of the line equipment means top of the line quality, and we are trying to be the best. This means acquiring the professional industry standards in cameras, lighting, sound, and production equipment. These don't come cheap by any means, but the quality return is more than worth it. </div><div>Props, Wardrobe, and Set Dressing- The better your show looks, the more this will draw your audience in. This means making the Waiting Line universe complete with unique costuming and wardrobe for each character, props for the characters, and set dressing which sets the scene for the action. Once a location is chosen, it has to be altered with props and set dressing to make the actual story line come to life. All of this costs money, folks, and it doesn't come cheap.  Help!<br/><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1188562/files/20150201133540-Waiting_Line_Cost_Cart.png?1422826540"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/>
</div><div>All of this adds up to what most would call a rather steep bill. That's part of the business, though! Our goal is to present our completed pilot to as many television networks as possible in the hopes that we will be picked up for syndication. Once that occurs, we make art and money!  And so do you, if you're an executive producer on the show (see below).  After all, that's what investing is all about, right? </div> <div> <h3></h3>

It will be groundbreaking in its very existence.  Think <i>Friends</i> with the modern next generation adding comic book ad-libs, animations and pop art.</p>
<p>Additionally, the concept of character growth in the ""manic pixie dream girl"" archetype has not been adequately shown in television thus far, with most men in current sitcoms depicted as  looking toward women objectively. We wish to change that by showing that it is indeed possible to grow into an understanding of people as, yes, people and women, as, yes, women.</p>
<p>We also wish to widen the diversity of general romantic comedy in the television medium through the portrayal of an African-American lead, an interracial love interest, and an openly gay African-American supporting character. While these three things aren't specifically important in the film industry, this genre of television has mainly stuck to white-washed casting with stereotypical minority characters. Changing that will be a good step towards social progress.</p> </div> <div> <h3></h3>

<p>That being said, we pride ourselves on our drive and absolutely guarantee top quality in our work. This is our first pilot, yes, but this isn't our first project.

Norah is very naive about the complexity and sophistication of city life and finds it very hard to adjust to the coldness and alienation sometimes apparent in an urban atmosphere.Despite the fact that Norah is a little lost most of the time, she is an amazing dancer.  However, none of her friends in the group really know this fact about her as she lacks the competitive drive and self-conscious bravado, at first, to make her talents known.  After only a week in the big city, although still not urbanized, she nonetheless seeks to overcompensate for this fact by running for president of every club at school she finds.  In the future, she will do an about-face in her life, and through experiences that put her through the fire, she will end up a CEO of company.  However, she does not know this yet and still lives in her small-town mind.
20 year-old aloof intellectual who must learn to open himself up and become one of the guys.Sebastian is a proud gay man. He truly believes himself to be the smartest man on the planet. He is easily annoyed by the crude provinciality of most people.  For him, a typical day at home finds him dressing in something ""fancy,"" sitting around the house in front of the fireplace, reading a cerebral book, and drinking the finest green tea in the world. He has shared a dorm room with Daemon at college for 2 years now. At first, Sebastian hated Daemon more than Hitler. In his mind at least Hitler could paint a beautiful picture! As the years went by, Sebastian become very fond of Daemon and found some small love for him hidden deep down inside himself. Sebastian has many lovers he brings around. None of them ever last because they just can't measure up to his intellect in his own mind.To better understand the characters, we have filmed a short promo to show their personalities - a slice in the life of these 6 friends.With lots of visual effects and over-the-top comedy, we are looking toward making a creative sitcom drawing influences from the feature film Scott Pilgrim vs The World, Friends, Coupling and Community! Before Waiting Line,  we made a short film about Ethan Dawson before he met Emerson Blake. This short gives you an indication of what we can create in 8 days on a budget of only $6000.
  
Making a sitcom costs money. This is where we really need your help. We are asking for $100,000.00 in funding to produce a pilot to shop to networks. (Believe it or not, that's not a lot as film budgets go; every penny is necessary.) 

This money goes toward several things, including but not limited to:
Actor compensation - ""the Talent,"" as we call them on set. They're the ones with the ability to make the entire project believable and successful.They are, of course, absolutely necessary and they don't always come cheap. On set food - whether it's craft services or catering, food on set is extremely important to both the actors and the crew. If the food is bad, the crew will be unmotivated and sluggish, and the actors will be on edge. Good food creates good atmosphere, which exponentially increases the quality on set. We try to have craft services on set, as well as attempting to adhere to union standards of a hot meal every six hours.Locations - Location, location, location! Every film, every business, needs a good location. For us, it's a place that can fit precisely the look we need to build the Waiting Line universe. These places exist, and are usually available, but they do cost money.Crew pay - Technicians on film crews are freelance, and their jobs are hard and unforgiving. They don't come cheap, and they're the ones who make the motor run. Without them, nothing in the filmworld happens. Topnotch professionals assure top quality work.Equipment - Easily accounting for 40% of our budget. Top of the line equipment means top of the line quality, and we are trying to be the best. This means acquiring the professional industry standards in cameras, lighting, sound, and production equipment. These don't come cheap by any means, but the quality return is more than worth it. Props, Wardrobe, and Set Dressing- The better your show looks, the more this will draw your audience in. This means making the Waiting Line universe complete with unique costuming and wardrobe for each character, props for the characters, and set dressing which sets the scene for the action. Once a location is chosen, it has to be altered with props and set dressing to make the actual story line come to life. All of this costs money, folks, and it doesn't come cheap.  Help!

All of this adds up to what most would call a rather steep bill. That's part of the business, though! Our goal is to present our completed pilot to as many television networks as possible in the hopes that we will be picked up for syndication. Once that occurs, we make art and money!  And so do you, if you're an executive producer on the show (see below).  After all, that's what investing is all about, right?   
 The concept behind Waiting Line - of live action situational comedy with an undercurrent of witty animation - is one that has never been explored. It will be groundbreaking in its very existence.  Think Friends with the modern next generation adding comic book ad-libs, animations and pop art.
Additionally, the concept of character growth in the ""manic pixie dream girl"" archetype has not been adequately shown in television thus far, with most men in current sitcoms depicted as  looking toward women objectively. We wish to change that by showing that it is indeed possible to grow into an understanding of people as, yes, people and women, as, yes, women.
We also wish to widen the diversity of general romantic comedy in the television medium through the portrayal of an African-American lead, an interracial love interest, and an openly gay African-American supporting character. While these three things aren't specifically important in the film industry, this genre of television has mainly stuck to white-washed casting with stereotypical minority characters. Changing that will be a good step towards social progress.   
There are quite a few risks involved with helping support an independent film company. That's the nature of film: it is a high risk investment. From breaking equipment to injured actors, from editing errors to simply not getting picked up, there are a myriad of things that can happen to a television show.

That being said, we pride ourselves on our drive and absolutely guarantee top quality in our work. This is our first pilot, yes, but this isn't our first project. We've produced top quality shorts and skits, some of which can be viewed on our Youtube page.  With all of us running the show, so to speak, we are experienced film technicians who have worked as freelancers on everything from small projects to big budget films. We know what we're doing.
Additionally, to secure ourselves a spot on a network, we have an agent for the company. Someone who knows the business of distribution and can help us get the pilot to the desks of all the major networks.
So yes, it's a high risk investment. We know what we're doing, though, and we are driven to succeed.   
If you can't support, or can't put forward as much as you'd like, there are other ways you can get involved and/or help! Just be sure to share this campaign with everyone you can think of! Know a business guy with a sweet tooth for entertainment? Send us his way! Ask your friends, ask your parents, ask the weird neighbors down the street! Every little bit of publicity, every small donation, helps us reach our ultimate goal:

A hilarious sit-com of epic proportions!

<p>Chronos Productions is a small Indie group that has been working on the pre-development of the Pandoran Age Chronicles multi-platform projects-Feature film, illustrated novels, animatics, video game concepts and more for a number of years now. Like all indies sweat equity has gotten us this far but now we need your help! Our aim is to create family friendly adventurous movies, games, and  but also to create jobs for people where they can use their talents and imaginations to inspire, and even educate. Dantes books are filled with historical references and mythology We have 8 books currently, and a volume of film production animation script breakdowns, concept art, and original digital models, and would like to produce another short film with more characters and upgrade the project proposal. We currently have a letter of Intent from a major film producer, and are looking to create an expansion of a short promo film.</p>
<p> Our first short film,The Derelict, was created with zero budget by a small group of dedicated  creatives. We would like to expand more of Millin's story in another short film...OBSCURO FRIO, which would include more of the back story. </p>

</div></div>","Currently we are in a focused raise of $2500 to send myself Suzanne Eberhardt ( associate producer) and Dante D'Anthony the franchise creator, visionary and writer to the American Film Market. Check out the new perks !!!! We have established connections that a face to face meeting would go a long way ,Please contribute now- even 10 dollars x 200 persons or 20 people x 100 or 40 x 50.00 etc....would be a help to getting there!

Chronos Productions is a small Indie group that has been working on the pre-development of the Pandoran Age Chronicles multi-platform projects-Feature film, illustrated novels, animatics, video game concepts and more for a number of years now. Like all indies sweat equity has gotten us this far but now we need your help! Our aim is to create family friendly adventurous movies, games, and  but also to create jobs for people where they can use their talents and imaginations to inspire, and even educate. Dantes books are filled with historical references and mythology We have 8 books currently, and a volume of film production animation script breakdowns, concept art, and original digital models, and would like to produce another short film with more characters and upgrade the project proposal. We currently have a letter of Intent from a major film producer, and are looking to create an expansion of a short promo film.
 Our first short film,The Derelict, was created with zero budget by a small group of dedicated  creatives. We would like to expand more of Millin's story in another short film...OBSCURO FRIO, which would include more of the back story. 
Please help us keep the project moving with additional animation software, a focused trip to the american film market for face to face meetings with already established connections to get to the next step  and resources needed to bring this important vision-and the underlying message so important to individuals today, to the screen. A message in a world that seems increasingly traumatic, and abandoning its social cohesion, duty, and bonds: that the demons must be faced and defeated with the imperfections all Humans share. It is that choice, since we live in a world we did not make, and endure injustice all around, that becomes magnificent, and heroic!

</div></div>","About the ProjectThis is a Trilogy startingThe Singularity The Rarity and Plurality.
The setting is on a planet called Pamveer it is large, powerful, and seemingly one of a kind. Even planets get depressed, especially those which are alive, have awareness of self, and have feelings. Pamveer feels, terribly, alone. Sensing sentient life in another parallel universe, Pamveer makes the connection. Using the energy in her own blood, 
Pamveer creates trans-dimensional portals through which she abducts thousands of new companions, from throughout Earth's history.
Almost all of her champions immediately die of thirst. For the only liquid on Pamveer is the life blood of Pamveer herself.
A precious few manage to survive on the life found therein. From these, within a few generations, Pamveer has existing with her, a Stone-age civilization that only she could love. She loves them enough to allow them access back to Earth. Where they can hunt, gather human slaves for themselves back on Pamveer, and feast on other life. It is that found in the blood of those on Earth. We know visitors from Pamveer as VAMPIRES. 
Michael a nearly helpless Commando they abduct, knows them only as his masters, is about to make his displeasure felt. For he is only nearly helpless. Inserting himself into the middle of a civil war between Kage and the King, He must soon flee for his life. He is a military man, used to fighting with what comes to hand. In this case, war must be conducted with grass, wood and stone brought from the Earth. Because Pamveer will allow no metal in her world. But even so handicapped, Michael elevates the art of bloodshed to a level never seen before on Pamveer. He will not allow his new found love, to perish with her father. With her chosen companions dying at an alarming rate, Pamveer must make her own decisions. And those decisions will forever affect Michael and Eleanor. As well as our Earth.
Synopsis for THE RARITYSome give their god, the worship and love due them. Others just use their god for whatever they can get. Kage belongs to the second category. The new ruler on Pamveer cares only for his own power and has no gratitude for life given daily by Pamveer. With the planet denying him access to the Earth, Kage creates his own paths. Boiling Pamveer’s blood creates the necessary trans-dimensional portals. Kage and his men ravage the Earth for blood and for slaves. There is one major problem with Kage’s gateways. Pamveer is slowly dying from the loss of her blood. And when she dies, so will everyone on her surface. Pamveer enlists the aid of anyone who still cares. She asks the remaining peasants to revolt.
But they are weak and lack leadership. She knows Eleanor still cares. But the princess is being hunted on the Earth by Kage’s men. The Earth, where Pamveer herself banished her. On Earth, Michael is exhausted. His seventeen-year-old daughter desperately needs some stability in her life. Child of both Pamveer and the Earth, Jillian just wants a normal life. Unlike her mother, Jillian is more than able to control her vampire heritage. But unable to digest human food, Eleanor needs a continual supply of blood to remain alive. Every time she feeds her way, resulting headlines bring Kage’s hunters to the family’s new location. And Michael is exhausted.Michael is done running. On the Earth, there is metal.
 Bullets can be made of hardwood, When you can load your own ammunition. Michael was born to battle and he now he’s ready to return to war. He will get his a chance to bring the battle back to Kage. As a last resort, Pamveer has turned to the one man she believes most adept at killing. He is desperately needed to lead the peasants in war. This time, in a rebellion against Kage. At stake is the life of Pamveer itself. So Michael, with his wife, his daughter, and two weaklings, returns to Pamveer.
Hoping to save a god.Synopsis for THE PLURALITYIt seemed like a good idea, until he got there. It was an opportunity to visit another dimension. It offered a chance to prove his self in a new environment. It even gave the boy time alone with the beautiful and mysterious Jillian from next door. What Levi never counted on was being crushed to the ground by the staggering gravitational pull of Pamveer. Or his resulting new nickname of ‘Worm.” Nonetheless, the Worm will prove an invaluable asset in Michael’s war for the life of Pamveer. While his body is basically worthless there, Levi’s mind still works fine. And that mind has been trained by too many games of ‘Risk.’ Move and countermove ensues as limited numbers of the peasant army are repeatedly depleted by too costly victories over Kage’s men. On the sidelines, one very young and unheralded stowaway wages her own fight against tyranny. Moreover, Michael’s escalating sophistication in weaponry is costing the dying planet the very companions she’s giving her life to save. Events move swiftly to a climax. With hope nearly gone, 
Michael’s family and remaining forces are trapped at the Well of Souls. There, with her strength completely gone, Pamveer can no longer help. Broken in spirit and in body, Michael’s family watches the last of the peasant army desert them. Face to face with an overwhelming enemy force, weaponless, and moments from death, the impossible occurs. The Worm makes one more decision. He makes one more sacrifice for a man he admires, a girl he loves, and a God for whom he has come to care deeply. Perhaps he is seeking one basic answer for all of humanity.

The majority of the film takes place in an iconic Black Cab that London is known for so the anamorphic lenses will solve our visual challenge of squeezing two people into the frame and still having a sense of space. We'll also be capturing a few of London's most iconic locations on a camera and lense that will do it justice.<br/>The 'equipment' is a jib arm - this piece of equipment will add dramatic impact and increase production value as it swoons down from 6' above it's subject for a cinematic feel. </span></p><p><b>Black Cab Rental - £1000 (through an independent driver)</b><br/>This is crucial to the shoot.

I owe a huge part of my success as a director to the actors whom I've cast. Their talent and skill to translate our shared vision of the character they're portraying into a screen performance that is authentic is the reason my stories work on screen. That's worth something!

SUNDAY PUNCH FILM REVIEW


CBC SHORT FILM FACE OFF

Check out full film here: SUNDAY PUNCHPHONE BOX TRAILER   http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3701388
WHAT WE NEED TO MAKE THIS FILMIn order to complete the full production we need to raise an additional £6180.00. Wherever possible I managed to negotiate incredible discounts on services (which I am incredibly grateful for). That combined with the same passionate production team that helped Phone Box be a success makes the amount we need to raise just enough to produce a beautiful looking film with excellent production value! This is how it breaks down;Film Studio Rental w/Lighting Package ( £1037 - 0ne day rental)We'll be shooting the cab interiors inside a cab, yes, but the cab will be inside a studio against a green screen. Shooting in studio gives us more control over lighting, sound and camera angles. 
Camera Package w/equipment & Anamorphic lenses - £810 (2 day rental)ARRI Alexa XT is the camera that will give this film the look and feel that I want. The majority of the film takes place in an iconic Black Cab that London is known for so the anamorphic lenses will solve our visual challenge of squeezing two people into the frame and still having a sense of space. We'll also be capturing a few of London's most iconic locations on a camera and lense that will do it justice.The 'equipment' is a jib arm - this piece of equipment will add dramatic impact and increase production value as it swoons down from 6' above it's subject for a cinematic feel. Black Cab Rental - £1000 (through an independent driver)This is crucial to the shoot. The entire story takes place in the back of a cab as our wedding party make their way to the private ceremony. The cost covers two 12hr days.  Professional, seasoned actors - £800 Honorarium (£200 x 4 actors)Actors are the single most important piece of any character driven film. I owe a huge part of my success as a director to the actors whom I've cast. Their talent and skill to translate our shared vision of the character they're portraying into a screen performance that is authentic is the reason my stories work on screen. That's worth something! This token amount is just that - a token of my appreciation. Their time and talent is worth far more than what I can raise here and I wish I could afford to give them more. However, giving them something and supporting their storytelling skills with a token amount goes a long way in saying 'I value your talent and contribution'. 
Miscellaneous production costs - £910
Hard drive's for digital back ups of what we've shot (hate to lose that!), audio equipment rentals, Craft service (FOOD!) to keep our cast and crew happy while we're shooting, Rental of a production vehicle & petrol during the exterior shooting, location permit fees.Post Production costs - £1100 (honorariums)(picture edit, sound edit/mix, visual effects, colour grading & deliverables)All these services will be pretty much donating their time a small honorarium for each.

We'll also be able to create reflections off the passenger windows from the outside looking in. Very cool stuff but you'll only see the end result and think it's natural :)

Q: Why a short film?
This is the first short film I've developed that speaks to a feature film I'm developing. Having a short piece with the same theme and tone helps when pitching the feature concept to funders.  As One is also a very solid stand alone piece that I'm certain will do quite well on the film festival circuit. The more festivals it plays the more recognition, the better my opportunities to get my feature film rolling. 


Q: Why not apply to funding agencies?

We applied to Creative England, a very competitive lottery fund, and the only scheme that was the best fit for the project. But alas, we were unsuccessful.



Q: I can't contribute. What else can I do to help? 
It's totally okay if you can't contribute cash. You can show your support by sharing our campaign link on your FB/Twitter account. It would mean a great deal if you could spread the word. The more people who know about our campaign the better our chances of reaching our funding goal.

<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""><b><i>It’s Just Us</i></b> is a scripted drama centered on a little gay bar nestled in the heart of a coastal Mississippi city.  For decades the bar has been the sanctuary for those who needed it most, whether they be gay, straight, black, or white.  A beacon of tolerance in a place where history has proven there is little.  <br/></span></p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Now the bar transitions into a new age and a new Civil Rights battle!  </span></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">THE STORY</span></p>
<p>Since the 60s, Just Us Lounge has been the ONE safe haven for its patrons.  A refuge... a second chance, whatever the community needs, Just Us has provided.  The bar has changed hands several times, but the values have stayed the same.  Until now!  The last owner of the bar died and bequeathed his sacred bar and home to his homophobic son...who he's been estranged with for nearly 20 years!  This can't end well for one of the South's landmark Gay bars.</p>
<p>Jordan Albritton has been the ideal son.  Honest, loyal, obedient...he's done everything his parents always taught him a 'good' son does.  So when he admits his sexuality to his father, the most powerful minister in the state, he's SHOCKED when his entire world comes crashing down around him.  Since no one in his hometown is willing to offend the good Reverend Albritton, Jordan has no choice but to make a pilgrimage to the only place he's ever heard of that would help guys like him. </p>
<p>Now that Bryce Jeter's service in the United States Air Force has ended, he has no IDEA what to do next.  He has no living family to return to.  As a second generation military man, he has no roots to speak of.  All he has are wants and desires...he's just not sure what to do with either!  In the meantime, he thinks he can stick around and help this homophobic yankee steer the bar in the right direction.  At least he can have an impact...or so he thinks!</p>

<p><span style=""background-color: initial;""><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""><i>Bryce Jeter:</i>  Recently discharged from the Air Force, Bryce doesn't really know what to do next.  He wants to fall in love and start a family, but that's easier said than done for a gay man in the deep south.  With no family to return to, Bryce decides to stick around for a while.  </span></span></p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;""><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">A boarder in the house that Tony inherits, the two men quickly become the best of friends.  And it's Bryce that begins to soften Tony's hard line anti-gay sentiment. </span></span></p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;""><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""><i>Jordan Albritton:</i> A superb student near the top of his class at Ole Miss, Jordan's entire life comes crashing down around him when he comes out to his parents.  The only child of one of the most powerful preachers in the deep south, Jordan is exiled by his family.  Not knowing what else to do, he heads to the one place he's heard of that can help. . . Just Us.  For the first time in his life he's completely on his own...and free to break any commandments he chooses!</span></span></p>
Together, the three men grow into a tight-knit family unit.  They bond as brothers, with the same fiery passion and, at times, explosive fury as any group of siblings.</div><div style=""text-align: justify;""><br/></div><div style=""text-align: right;"">

<p>The initial focus lies around JORDAN, who has only recently come out of the closet and as a result lost everything he has ever known.  Eventually the focus will shift the inner-conflict of TONY’S sexuality and perhaps a burgeoning romance among the housemates.</p>
<p>Also, several issues of LGBT rights will be explored from bullying to hate crimes; from marriage equality to discrimination and harassment.  Furthermore, the Deep South backdrop provides an opportunity to show the differences between the coastal community and more traditional, rural Mississippi communities.  Jordan proves to be the perfect conduit to contrast the differing communities and explore the varying levels of advancement in acceptance.  </p>
</div><div style=""text-align: justify;"">
<p>Far more than just a prime-time drama, It's Just Us  will serve as a social commentary on a rapidly growing sub-culture as well as a running examination of the shifting of societal taboos and tolerances.  Dissecting the ebb and flow of  a community reputable (and at times notorious) for its dogged adherence to all things ‘traditional’ as well as the growing influence of a LGBT culture as it increases in size (for no other reason than more people willing to come out and live their lives open and honestly without fear of ridicule or ruin).  </p>
<p>At its foundation It’s Just Us is a family oriented drama depicting an alternate family existing in a staunchly traditional bastion.  While the primary focus will lie with the three leads, plenty of latitude will be given to examine in depth the tangential, relevant issues.</p>

<div>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">In order to produce this pilot and shop the project to networks, we need your help.  Every dollar contributed will go directly into funding the filming and promotion of the series.  Here's what your helping us do:</span><br/>
</div>
<div>
<ol>
<li>Production Insurance - required by state law in order to film on public spaces (i.e. beaches, roads, etc.)</li>
<li>Equipment rentals and purchase in order to meet networks' specs and provide you with the highest quality sound and picture. While we have top notch cameras and boom mics, we still need lavalier mics, upgraded lighting equipment, and more.  To package and present it to networks, we have to shoot it in the highest quality.</li>
<li>Set operations, art, music, wardrobe and make up, locations fees, etc., are all mandatory expenses to make any production a successful one.  </li>
<li>Cast and crew salaries.  </li>
</ol>
<div>Our $7,000 goal covers the costs of production and post-production expenses.  </div>
<div>If we hit $10,000 then we will be able to market and promote our pilot on a national level.  In order to get the greatest attention from network executives, we need to have a strong social media presence...the more 'likes' and 'retweets' the stronger our position will be when it comes to finding a network home...AND being in as many of your homes as possible!</div>
<div>
<span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 30px; background-color: initial;"">The Impact</span><br/>
</div>
</div>
</div><div> <p>There a few things we'd like you to keep in mind.</p> <ul>
<li>This show is a show about unity, family, and togetherness.  In an age where gay teenagers are increasingly harassed and bullied, where suicide rats rise instead of fall, it's all the more important to present characters and situations that not only entertain, but also enlighten, and are able to be indentified with by those who fear they have to face these challenging times alone.  </li>
<li>This will be the FIRST episodic scripted drama set and shot entirely on the Mississippi Gulf Coast, which is vital for the burgeoning film industry developing within the state.  Steady work for camera men, actors, sound engineers, lighting experts, wardrobers... It's a big step and will heavily impact the rapidly growing industry in the state.  </li>
</ul>
</div><div> <p>To package and pitch a television series to networks takes an incredible effort.  While there is a strong interest in It's Just Us, it will get much stronger.  A great pilot followed up by an aggressive marketing campaign designed to peek intrigue and gather 'followers', 'likes', and 'retweets' will prove to the Hollywood big shots that Mississippi is capable and ready to accept this challenge.  </p>

Deep in the heart of the Bible Belt comes a story about family...just NOT the kind of family you're expecting.  

It’s Just Us is a scripted drama centered on a little gay bar nestled in the heart of a coastal Mississippi city.  For decades the bar has been the sanctuary for those who needed it most, whether they be gay, straight, black, or white.  A beacon of tolerance in a place where history has proven there is little.  
Now the bar transitions into a new age and a new Civil Rights battle!  
THE STORY
Since the 60s, Just Us Lounge has been the ONE safe haven for its patrons.  A refuge... a second chance, whatever the community needs, Just Us has provided.  The bar has changed hands several times, but the values have stayed the same.  Until now!  The last owner of the bar died and bequeathed his sacred bar and home to his homophobic son...who he's been estranged with for nearly 20 years!  This can't end well for one of the South's landmark Gay bars.
Jordan Albritton has been the ideal son.  Honest, loyal, obedient...he's done everything his parents always taught him a 'good' son does.  So when he admits his sexuality to his father, the most powerful minister in the state, he's SHOCKED when his entire world comes crashing down around him.  Since no one in his hometown is willing to offend the good Reverend Albritton, Jordan has no choice but to make a pilgrimage to the only place he's ever heard of that would help guys like him. 
Now that Bryce Jeter's service in the United States Air Force has ended, he has no IDEA what to do next.  He has no living family to return to.  As a second generation military man, he has no roots to speak of.  All he has are wants and desires...he's just not sure what to do with either!  In the meantime, he thinks he can stick around and help this homophobic yankee steer the bar in the right direction.  At least he can have an impact...or so he thinks!


                THE CHARACTERS

Tony Ramirez:  A successful entrepreneur from New York City, Ramirez inherits the bar from his estranged, gay father whom he hasn't spoken to in since childhood. His parents divorced when he was a child after his father came out of the closet.  
Tony never forgave his father and was shocked to learn of the inheritance.   Yet the businessman in him never passes up an opportunity to  profit.  And despite his homophobia, he looks to whip the struggling bar into shape and sell high!
Bryce Jeter:  Recently discharged from the Air Force, Bryce doesn't really know what to do next.  He wants to fall in love and start a family, but that's easier said than done for a gay man in the deep south.  With no family to return to, Bryce decides to stick around for a while.  
A boarder in the house that Tony inherits, the two men quickly become the best of friends.  And it's Bryce that begins to soften Tony's hard line anti-gay sentiment. 
Jordan Albritton: A superb student near the top of his class at Ole Miss, Jordan's entire life comes crashing down around him when he comes out to his parents.  The only child of one of the most powerful preachers in the deep south, Jordan is exiled by his family.  Not knowing what else to do, he heads to the one place he's heard of that can help. . . Just Us.  For the first time in his life he's completely on his own...and free to break any commandments he chooses!
Together, the three men grow into a tight-knit family unit.  They bond as brothers, with the same fiery passion and, at times, explosive fury as any group of siblings.

     THE SERIES                 

The initial focus lies around JORDAN, who has only recently come out of the closet and as a result lost everything he has ever known.  Eventually the focus will shift the inner-conflict of TONY’S sexuality and perhaps a burgeoning romance among the housemates.
Also, several issues of LGBT rights will be explored from bullying to hate crimes; from marriage equality to discrimination and harassment.  Furthermore, the Deep South backdrop provides an opportunity to show the differences between the coastal community and more traditional, rural Mississippi communities.  Jordan proves to be the perfect conduit to contrast the differing communities and explore the varying levels of advancement in acceptance.  

Far more than just a prime-time drama, It's Just Us  will serve as a social commentary on a rapidly growing sub-culture as well as a running examination of the shifting of societal taboos and tolerances.  Dissecting the ebb and flow of  a community reputable (and at times notorious) for its dogged adherence to all things ‘traditional’ as well as the growing influence of a LGBT culture as it increases in size (for no other reason than more people willing to come out and live their lives open and honestly without fear of ridicule or ruin).  
At its foundation It’s Just Us is a family oriented drama depicting an alternate family existing in a staunchly traditional bastion.  While the primary focus will lie with the three leads, plenty of latitude will be given to examine in depth the tangential, relevant issues.
   What We Need & What You Get




In order to produce this pilot and shop the project to networks, we need your help.  Every dollar contributed will go directly into funding the filming and promotion of the series.  Here's what your helping us do:



Production Insurance - required by state law in order to film on public spaces (i.e. beaches, roads, etc.)
Equipment rentals and purchase in order to meet networks' specs and provide you with the highest quality sound and picture. While we have top notch cameras and boom mics, we still need lavalier mics, upgraded lighting equipment, and more.  To package and present it to networks, we have to shoot it in the highest quality.
Set operations, art, music, wardrobe and make up, locations fees, etc., are all mandatory expenses to make any production a successful one.  
Cast and crew salaries.  

Our $7,000 goal covers the costs of production and post-production expenses.  
If we hit $10,000 then we will be able to market and promote our pilot on a national level.  In order to get the greatest attention from network executives, we need to have a strong social media presence...the more 'likes' and 'retweets' the stronger our position will be when it comes to finding a network home...AND being in as many of your homes as possible!

The Impact


 There a few things we'd like you to keep in mind. 
This show is a show about unity, family, and togetherness.  In an age where gay teenagers are increasingly harassed and bullied, where suicide rats rise instead of fall, it's all the more important to present characters and situations that not only entertain, but also enlighten, and are able to be indentified with by those who fear they have to face these challenging times alone.  
This will be the FIRST episodic scripted drama set and shot entirely on the Mississippi Gulf Coast, which is vital for the burgeoning film industry developing within the state.  Steady work for camera men, actors, sound engineers, lighting experts, wardrobers... It's a big step and will heavily impact the rapidly growing industry in the state.  

 To package and pitch a television series to networks takes an incredible effort.  While there is a strong interest in It's Just Us, it will get much stronger.  A great pilot followed up by an aggressive marketing campaign designed to peek intrigue and gather 'followers', 'likes', and 'retweets' will prove to the Hollywood big shots that Mississippi is capable and ready to accept this challenge.

<p>THE LONG WAY is our feature film and we are extremely passionate about making it. We need <b>your </b>help to
stretch our meager budget enough to fit our not-so-meager dreams for this film.
Taking the plunge and chasing
your dreams is a difficult thing to do. For the cast and crew of The Long Way,
this project is a big step in our creative and professional journeys. Through
this IndieGoGo, we're inviting you to become a part of this journey and help us
make something great.</p>
<p></p> </div> <div> <h3>Basics</h3>
<p>TLW could be described as a “coming of age classic meets
road trip indie”. Inspired by actual events, The Long Way touches on many topics we can all relate to: following a stable career vs. following your
passion, religion, family pressure, long distance relationships, moving away
from home, and taking risks along the way. </p>
<p>Adulthood is scary and taking the plunge to follow your
dreams is even scarier. Much like the theme of the film, our goal is to pursue our dreams and create an amazing movie. We will be shooting the film in Late May 2015 for approximately four weeks. We will shoot half of the film in Los Angeles
and then venture to Oregon for the other half. Our film will be shot under SAG
contract.</p>
<p>The screenplay
was inspired by a real trip that Josh (the writer) took when he moved to Los
Angeles a year and a half ago. While it isn’t quite based on a true story, many
elements of the characters and plot were lifted from real life. From broad
character descriptions to details as small as imaginary camp girlfriends, the real
elements of Josh's life that are weaved into the plot will make the story more
honest and cause Josh's parents to squirm.</p>

<p>What happens when
the generation that got soccer trophies just for participation stumbles into
the real world where everyone doesn’t always win? This story is for everyone
who has questioned whether they’re truly as special as their parents and
teachers told them they are.</p>
<p>THE LONG WAY is a
coming of age road movie about a young writer who travels to Los Angeles to
follow his dream. The title refers both to the actual route of Sam’s trip (he
goes south to Florida before heading west to Los Angeles) and his stunted
journey to adulthood. Even though the world sees him as an adult, Sam still
thinks of himself as a 25 year old kid. He has delayed maturation because he’s
scared of it and because the people around him have let him. By traveling
around the country en route to his new home, he learns what it means to
be an adult from his family and friends along the way.</p>
<p>The night before
Sam is to leave with Emma on the road trip, she gives him an ultimatum: If he
doesn't say he loves her, she won't go. From there, Sam’s trip weaves between
the realities of the trip with his girlfriend Emma and his best friend
Howie. </p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1096757/files/20141214234935-_MG_7432.jpg?1418629775"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Emma is cautious
and thinks through every decision she makes. She’s had her life planned out
from the get-go and she can’t understand how loose Sam is with his big decisions. With this road trip, Emma tries to get Sam to realize how foolish it
is to enter an uncertain future and attempts to convince him to join her in reality.</p>
<p>Howie lives his
life on the fly, going wherever and doing whatever he thinks is the most fun.
He refuses to be bogged down by responsibilities or conform to expectations, so
much so that he is a contrarian for no real reason. On the road trip, Howie
wants Sam to let loose and shirk responsibilities, if only to legitimize his
own way of life.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1096762/files/20141214235110-_MG_7426.jpg?1418629870"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>These two trips
butt heads as Sam strives to achieve the balance between the two sides of his
personality. In order to really grow up and become the adult he wants to be,
Sam tries to balance his opposing desires to take risks and play it safe.</p>

For Howie, being an
adult is exercising the freedom to do whatever the hell one wants to do. For
Emma, adulthood is when you resist your urges and make responsible choices.
Through the road trip, Sam needs to figure out what being an adult means to him. </div><div><br/></div> <div> <h3>Meet the Cast</h3>

Like her character, Renee also prefers to reject labels unless they come as reviews of her acting talent, which has been described as: ""amazing"", ""riveting"" and ""wow!"". This talented actress has a resume that includes several USC (her alma mater) graduate films as well as Broadcast/Hosting projects and numerous theatre productions.http://www.imdb.com/name/nm5624753/
There will be more cast and crew announcements to come in the next month, so be sure to keep up with our exciting updates!

We know almost nothing about Jesus'

Why, When, and How did this remarkable power develop? 

What events composed his youth?
Which people and issues challenged him?
Who were his teachers?
Did he travel outside his nation? 
What was his family home like - was he a good
     older brother? 
What did he have to teach us of the
     essence of our consciousness?
What was it like having Roman soldiers

<div>This house was built in 1907 and bought by my granfather in 1925 as a vacation house. Spetses has always been a high class resort, frequented by the wealthy , who would come to the island in their yachts, but also a very popular family spot, as it is close to Athens. The house is in the center of the village, 3 minutes walk from the port and 2 minutes from the beach. It is 90m2, fully equipped to sleep 4-6 people and it's small internal garden is a good place to spend a lazy afternoon. All this has given me the idea of renovating it into a friendly, family vacation house for people who want to visit a really beautiful Greek island, but not mix with the crouds. The house may be old, but it is well maintained. A good renovation will highlight it's traditional features and upgrade it into a really pleasant summer family accomodation.</div>

<p><br/></p>
<p>From award winning director, producer, and actress Wendy Keeling, comes Bounty Momma, a comedic redneck romp wrapped up as a web series. If you could find a way to combine Reno 911, The Beverly Hillbillies, and Dog the Bounty Hunter you may just come up with Bounty Momma!<br/></p>  <br/>With our pilot shot and submitted to film festivals we are now ready to continue shooting the web series / TV show. We will be screening the pilot at the prestigious <b>Nashville Film Festival</b> in April and at the <b>Cape Fear Independent Film Festival </b>in June. We have already shot 3 episodes and plans are already underway to shoot the last 3 episodes for season #1. We are working under a SAG New Media Contract. It is our plan to pitch the series to networks and online distribution but we plan to go live with the web series online in March no matter what!<br/><br/><br/><b>Synopsis: </b><br/>The bounty hunting world will never be the same under the watch of hot  
redneck momma Twyla Sue Dollarhide and her dim witted family. Twyla Sue 
 Dollarhide, aka ""Bounty Mama"", is a no-nonsense southern firecracker  
with a reality show who, despite the incompetence of her gun toting  
lamebrain family and film crew, proudly boasts that she ""always gets her
  man""! This reality parody brings the viewer inside the day to day of a
  dysfunctional family business that turns otherwise mundane bounty  
escapades into mayhem and madness.<br/><br/> <p></p>

It is our last day of the fundraiser!! Please consider a donation of any size to help us meet our goal!


From award winning director, producer, and actress Wendy Keeling, comes Bounty Momma, a comedic redneck romp wrapped up as a web series. If you could find a way to combine Reno 911, The Beverly Hillbillies, and Dog the Bounty Hunter you may just come up with Bounty Momma!  With our pilot shot and submitted to film festivals we are now ready to continue shooting the web series / TV show. We will be screening the pilot at the prestigious Nashville Film Festival in April and at the Cape Fear Independent Film Festival in June. We have already shot 3 episodes and plans are already underway to shoot the last 3 episodes for season #1. We are working under a SAG New Media Contract. It is our plan to pitch the series to networks and online distribution but we plan to go live with the web series online in March no matter what!Synopsis: The bounty hunting world will never be the same under the watch of hot  
redneck momma Twyla Sue Dollarhide and her dim witted family. Twyla Sue 
 Dollarhide, aka ""Bounty Mama"", is a no-nonsense southern firecracker  
with a reality show who, despite the incompetence of her gun toting  
lamebrain family and film crew, proudly boasts that she ""always gets her
  man""! This reality parody brings the viewer inside the day to day of a
  dysfunctional family business that turns otherwise mundane bounty  
escapades into mayhem and madness.

<p>The producers at WHITE RONIN PRODUCTIONS are seeking funds to complete their first feature film OTHER WORLD.

<p><b>FILM SYNOPSIS:</b><br/></p>
<p>Two brothers are members of The Fifth Wall, a small resistance group, who are fighting a losing battle to defend their small town from an invading alien species known as the Greys and their assorted alien-tech killing machines. During one mission on the outskirts of town, to save their commanding officer’s daughter, the brothers uncover a shocking truth that will change their world. <br/>
<br/>This alien invasion was created by the Government. The whole town has been locked away from “the real world” as part of a combat data collection project established after government operatives discovered Grey genetic code decades ago. The Grey are clones, as are the town’s inhabitants. All part of a military test case established to prepare the Earth for an upcoming attack by the Greys. What is real and who will survive?</p>
<p><b>WHITE RONIN PRODUCTIONS</b> are credited with post production visual effects on the multi-award winning sci-fi 54 DAYS. <br/>To date the film has received rave reviews and won awards internationally such as:<br/>Best Cinematographer<br/>Best Foreign Film<br/>Best Director<br/>Grand Jury prize for best festival film<br/>Special grand jury prize<br/>plus many more....</p>

<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Based on the true story of a young Afro-Caribbean girl growing up in Britain during the 1980's. </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Last Leg explores the </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">life of 15 year old Reyna, </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">living with an abusive father as she struggles to pursue her passion in
swimming. She is training to win first place but with a father who controls the world around her, the goal to win
is tested.  </span><br/></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Not only is there a lack of representation of black women such as ‘Reyna’ but also a
stigma has been attached </span>by the media<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> to those who have been physically
abused. </span></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Last Leg raises social awareness on violence against women. This is an individuals story that explains just
because you are surrounded by violence at home does not mean you lack education, intelligence or ambition. Reyna didn’t receive encouragement from any of her family
members, which is inspiring, and not just to me.</span><br/></p><p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""><br/></span></p>

<p>Upon hearing this story I was drawn to her wisdom and ability to channel positive
energy out of a horrific situation. I imagined swimming being her escapism and peace.</p>
<p>At this period in time she personally faced
brutal racism and sexism. Not just in the society she lived in but also in her domestic environment where she was mentally and physically abused. So, the fact that she
could be ambitious despite being faced with constant
discouragement, inspired me to make this
into a short film.</p>
<p>I found that it would be poetic to visually contrast the solemn, hostile
and vicious environment to the peaceful and serene nature of her swimming. In this
story, the statement I am making is no matter how much someone is pushed down, it will never take away the integrity of the
human strength and their talent.</p>

</div>","Based on the true story of a young Afro-Caribbean girl growing up in Britain during the 1980's. Last Leg explores the life of 15 year old Reyna, living with an abusive father as she struggles to pursue her passion in
swimming. She is training to win first place but with a father who controls the world around her, the goal to win
is tested.  
Not only is there a lack of representation of black women such as ‘Reyna’ but also a
stigma has been attached by the media to those who have been physically
abused. 
Last Leg raises social awareness on violence against women. This is an individuals story that explains just
because you are surrounded by violence at home does not mean you lack education, intelligence or ambition. Reyna didn’t receive encouragement from any of her family
members, which is inspiring, and not just to me.


Upon hearing this story I was drawn to her wisdom and ability to channel positive
energy out of a horrific situation. I imagined swimming being her escapism and peace.
At this period in time she personally faced
brutal racism and sexism. Not just in the society she lived in but also in her domestic environment where she was mentally and physically abused. So, the fact that she
could be ambitious despite being faced with constant
discouragement, inspired me to make this
into a short film.
I found that it would be poetic to visually contrast the solemn, hostile
and vicious environment to the peaceful and serene nature of her swimming. In this
story, the statement I am making is no matter how much someone is pushed down, it will never take away the integrity of the
human strength and their talent.




Last Leg already has a dedicated crew who are exhuberently working towards taking this story from the pages to the screen.
With your help we will utilise your donation to raise the values of this production. Your support will contribute towards securing locations, sourcing costumes, props, designing sets, equipment
hire and distributing the final film. 
Your donation enables Last Leg to be entered into film festivals for potential exclusive screenings, which in turn will expose the final film to the general public.
The production will be able to excel due to your generosity, so the team would like to thank you in advance for any contribution you make!

<div>We already know this will be the best TV show out of Atlanta since <i>The Walking Dead</i>. Be a part of history with us!</div>
<div>If we do not reach our small target goal, we will still apply whatever funds we do raise to the first things that come up during filming. We will all work towards the completed episode and reach our destination one way or another.<br/><br/>
</div> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>We feel so strongly about <i>Disco Girl and Funky Fresh</i>, we are willing to share our experience with you by blogging at the end of each filming day, and even having each of you out to the last day of filming, so you will see firsthand what we did with your help as a thank you to every single contributor of any amount. </p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">We feel it is important to remind the world how special women are, that they can hold their own against any and all odds (just ask any kid about his or her Mom), and so many wonderful things about the 1970's too! America was at a wonderful height in the 70's.</span></p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Every episode will have a very meaningful topic in today's society, such as: the importance of Recycling, Electric Cars/Vehicles, the importance of Solar Power, Organic Food (Our heroes will stop The GMO Gang!, Conservation, Saving the Parks, Oil Spills, Poisoned Water, Peer Pressure, Sexual Pressure, Gay Bashing, Stalking, Craft Beer, Attacking The Honey Bees, Cutting (self mutilation) and even more important topics to our society and well being.</span></p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">The statistics of our team as individuals is testimony to the strength of our team as a whole. With roles and parts in Fast 5, The Vampire Diaries, Indecent Proposal 2, Big Mommas House, Hall Pass, Drop Dead Diva, Single Ladies, Christmas Cupid, The Lost Footage, Bloated Minds, The Innocence of Darkness, Her, Nightstalking, Rite of Passage, Reunited: A Southern Touch, Saguaro, A Time For Everything, On the House, Blood Ties, Let It Shine, Photographers' Clubhouse, Kingdom Hearts, Intractable, Web of Dreams, Polarized, Birdcage, I've Ben Drinking About You,  Unleashed, It Should Have Been Me, The Legacy of Phineas, John &amp; Mindy and many, many others! </span></p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">We are all available to write to, and in most cases call and chat how things are going during filming from our office.</span></p> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p> For Season 1 Episode 1 we will only film on weekends as to not disrupt two of our actresses school teacher jobs. Doing this could potentially make us run a little late wrapping up filming if we have more than one weekend of rain. From season 1 episode 2 forward, we most likely will not have to worry about this.</p> <ul> <li>We have already addressed this possibility and have developed plans A, B and C to help us compensate.</li> <li>If we ever do fall behind with our filming schedule, we'll have planned in advance for a substitute teacher for both actresses if necessary and film on two consecutive days to get us right back on track timing-wise. We have also made a special shoot-around schedule that will enable us to shoot other scenes featuring other characters in case weather ever did get us behind schedule.</li>
<li>ADDITIONAL RISK: Since this was my first IndieGoGo campaign, I did not know that there would be no place to add the costs of printing and mailing all of the items to our contributors. So, that left us with a $1,200.00 difference between $5,000.00 and $6,200.00. We are prepared to take the costs of printing and mailing out of the $5,000.00 balance if necessary.<br/>
</li> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p>If you want to, but are unable to contribute funds to help make this wonderful TV show come to everyone--you can still help:</p> <ul> <li>Help us get the word out and make some noise all over the internet, at work, at school and everywhere else about Disco Girl and Funky Fresh!<br/>
</li> <li>Please do use the Indiegogo share tools!</li>

<ul> </ul> </div> <p><br/></p></div>","Disco Girl and Funky Fresh is bringing back many great things from the 1970's--the music, the clothes, the cars, the lingo, the swagger and the love for Peace!
Disco Girl and Funky Fresh will tackle
 evil villains, evil henchmen, evil super gangs and some of the most 
important topics of today's society in each episode.
 Projected start date for filming is the first week of May 2015 
(weather permitting). 
Season 1 is expected to produce eight episodes. 
Season 2 is already nearing conceptual completion. Each episode is 
expected to be 24 minutes running time. 
Every episode will have a very 
meaningful topic in today's society, such as: 

The importance of 
Recycling
Electric Cars/Vehicles
The importance of Solar Power
Organic Food (Our heroes will stop The GMO Gang!)
Conservation
Saving 
the Parks
Oil Spills
Poisoned Water
Peer Pressure
Sexual Pressure
Gay Bashing
Stalking
Craft Beer
Attacking The Honey Bees
Cutting 
(self mutilation)

Even more important topics to our society and well
 being will be covered in each episode!


Contributors of this special project will help share the greatness of the 1970's with all ages and walks of life today. We're ready to do this series for 10 years for people to really enjoy and take trips down memory lane. 
Come along for the ride with crime fighting ladies who pay lots of homage to the 1970's!   What We Need & What You Get

We only need $6,200.00 to complete season 1, episode 1 of Disco Girl and Funky Fresh. We have an extremely talented team on board 100% to get this crucial episode completed--many by taking deferred or no pay because they feel so strongly about this project. That is how we have this down to a mere $6,200.00 for a full production team behind the cameras and a dozen actors and actresses, numerous locations in and around Atlanta, fuel costs, clothing and every single item needed for filming over the most part of a month--plus all of the perks to send to our contributors! 

To pull all of this off in a cinematic quality at this low amount is almost unheard of when you count all of the people, props and locations--along with fuel costs. That's how much we all believe in Disco Girl and Funky Fresh!
 For a $50.00 donation you can get an autographed picture of the cast!

For $100.00 you can get an autographed picture of the cast and the crew!

For $250.00 you can get an autographed picture of the cast and the crew and an official Disco Girl and Funky Fresh license plate!

We already know this will be the best TV show out of Atlanta since The Walking Dead. Be a part of history with us!
If we do not reach our small target goal, we will still apply whatever funds we do raise to the first things that come up during filming. We will all work towards the completed episode and reach our destination one way or another.
   The Impact We feel so strongly about Disco Girl and Funky Fresh, we are willing to share our experience with you by blogging at the end of each filming day, and even having each of you out to the last day of filming, so you will see firsthand what we did with your help as a thank you to every single contributor of any amount. 
We feel it is important to remind the world how special women are, that they can hold their own against any and all odds (just ask any kid about his or her Mom), and so many wonderful things about the 1970's too! America was at a wonderful height in the 70's.
Every episode will have a very meaningful topic in today's society, such as: the importance of Recycling, Electric Cars/Vehicles, the importance of Solar Power, Organic Food (Our heroes will stop The GMO Gang!, Conservation, Saving the Parks, Oil Spills, Poisoned Water, Peer Pressure, Sexual Pressure, Gay Bashing, Stalking, Craft Beer, Attacking The Honey Bees, Cutting (self mutilation) and even more important topics to our society and well being.
The statistics of our team as individuals is testimony to the strength of our team as a whole. With roles and parts in Fast 5, The Vampire Diaries, Indecent Proposal 2, Big Mommas House, Hall Pass, Drop Dead Diva, Single Ladies, Christmas Cupid, The Lost Footage, Bloated Minds, The Innocence of Darkness, Her, Nightstalking, Rite of Passage, Reunited: A Southern Touch, Saguaro, A Time For Everything, On the House, Blood Ties, Let It Shine, Photographers' Clubhouse, Kingdom Hearts, Intractable, Web of Dreams, Polarized, Birdcage, I've Ben Drinking About You,  Unleashed, It Should Have Been Me, The Legacy of Phineas, John & Mindy and many, many others! 
We are all available to write to, and in most cases call and chat how things are going during filming from our office.   Risks & Challenges  For Season 1 Episode 1 we will only film on weekends as to not disrupt two of our actresses school teacher jobs. Doing this could potentially make us run a little late wrapping up filming if we have more than one weekend of rain. From season 1 episode 2 forward, we most likely will not have to worry about this.  We have already addressed this possibility and have developed plans A, B and C to help us compensate. If we ever do fall behind with our filming schedule, we'll have planned in advance for a substitute teacher for both actresses if necessary and film on two consecutive days to get us right back on track timing-wise. We have also made a special shoot-around schedule that will enable us to shoot other scenes featuring other characters in case weather ever did get us behind schedule.
ADDITIONAL RISK: Since this was my first IndieGoGo campaign, I did not know that there would be no place to add the costs of printing and mailing all of the items to our contributors. So, that left us with a $1,200.00 difference between $5,000.00 and $6,200.00. We are prepared to take the costs of printing and mailing out of the $5,000.00 balance if necessary.
    Other Ways You Can Help If you want to, but are unable to contribute funds to help make this wonderful TV show come to everyone--you can still help:  Help us get the word out and make some noise all over the internet, at work, at school and everywhere else about Disco Girl and Funky Fresh!

<p>     What started as an idea at the pub, quickly turned into a short film which won the Home Brew award by coming in first place for Local Shorts at the Kingston Canadian Film Festival. We, the film makers, now hope to take the next step and make the full-length feature film, but we need your help!</p>
<p>     'Sir John A. and the Curse of the Anti-Quenched’ follows two brothers during a night out in Kingston, Ontario, as they celebrate a recent promotion. Their night of celebration is interrupted when they find themselves stuck in the middle of a 150 year old curse that was initiated by Sir John A. Providing a comedic take on history, the film satirically describes one of Canada’s infamous histories: Sir John A’s well-known tendency to frequently be inebriated. The curse - which states that those who remain sober will be transformed into soul-sucking demons - is used to explain the true reason behind Canada’s first prime minister’s inclination to drink. The brothers, already out for a night on the town, are the city's only hope to dispel the curse. In addition to putting a comedic spin on actual events from Canada’s national and Kingston’s local histories, the film also narrates a coming of age story for the two protagonists. In the process of dispelling the curse, both brothers solve problems in their own lives and learn things about themselves as individuals.</p>

brought him there.
H-Town ‘the movie’ emotionally captures the main
character’s struggle to maintain and survive as Segundo Barrio (Second Ward)
is once again a major turning point in his life as he has to rely on the
support of the old neighborhood to help raise his son. The audience learns what
it takes for him to start all over again as an adult to thrive in the heart of
the city and navigate around its many temptations as an up and coming sports

Hi Funders!

I would like to introduce you to Susan, one of life's idlers. She's too lazy to work, too lazy to exercise, too lazy to love. But she does like a good roll in the hay!

We are bringing brilliant literature back to life in a feature film!

We are Andrew Willig, Elisa King, and Will Shung, and we are bringing ""Idle Thoughts of an Idle Fellow"" back into the 21st Century. Idle thoughts was written in 1886 by well known British humorist Jerome K Jerome, who is best remembered for his work Three Men in a Boat. However, one of his other great works, Idle Thoughts, is almost unknown to modern readers and film goers.

We plan to change all that.

We are filmmakers from Vancouver, Canada and we want to make our first feature film. Andrew Willig has been working in TV and film for five years and has worked on movies such as Fifty Shades of Grey, and Tomorrowland in the lighting department. Not to mention dozens of TV shows such as Once Upon a Time, and Falling Skies. Elisa King is is both a singer-songwriter and an actress, writer and director. She produce several of her own short films and is ready for her first feature. Will Shung is a sales and marketing professional, and short film maker, who runs an award nominated cultural Blog on Vancouver's art scene.

And we think we can do a hell of a lot with a relatively small amount of money! We think we can make you a hilarious rom-com based on Idle Thoughts for just $60,000. And that's $60,000 Canadian dollars ;-).
   What We Need & What You Get
We have already raised $10k in private funding, but filming is expensive. So we are looking to find a fan base who will buy tickets in advance, and help us raise another $50k. All the funding we receive will go into the cost of film production, there will be no production fee on the project, but we aim to raise enough to make reasonable payments to key cast and crew, and have all expenses covered. The costs are:


Cast & Crew
Production Equipment
Location fees
Insurance & Permits
Post Production

The Benefits:
Our best perks will get you a part in our movie, signed memorabilia, invitations to the premier (which will hopefully be at a major international film festival), or even an Executive Producer credit on IMDb!


Come hell or high water we are going to make this movie, but if funds are low, the current script will be descaled to make it more manageable (no horses or orcs).



 The Impact of Your Support
This campaign is going to bring a truly wonderful, but largely forgotten piece of english literature back to life. Jerome K Jerome deserves to be remembered alongside Jane Austin as a great humorist and writer. We believe he needs to be resurrected in the public mind, because sadly at the moment he is almost unknown.

We have, individually and together made, dozens of local TV shows and short films, and developed a wide circle of contacts in the local film industry. Now is the time for our first feature film, and we are bursting to get this done!
 This is an opportunity to bring truly artistic and poetic writing back into fashion.

    Risks & Challenges! Oh My.
This production is very low risk if our funding goals are met. Our main obstacles will be getting quality locations that really leap off the screen and capture the key moments in the script.

Your funding will allow us budget for shooting in and around Vancouver, in national parks and at some of BC's most beautiful locations.

<b><br/></b><p>Hi everyone! I'm Guillermo Pepe, executive director at Fundacion
Telmed. FT is a telemedicine NGO from Argentina that is helping to radically
decrease the number of women dying of breast cancer. Argentina ranks number
2 in risk of dying of breast cancer in Latin America. <b>7000 WOMEN DIE EACH YEAR. THAT MEANS THAT IN 7000 FAMILIES A LOVED ONE
GOES MISSING EVERY YEAR! </b></p>
<p>IN FIGHTING BREAST CANCER, <b>EARLY DIAGNOSIS</b> <b>IS</b>, 98%
OF THE TIME, <b>A LIFE SAVIOUR</b>!</p>
<p>How we are <b>preventing
women from dying of breast cancer</b>: </p>
<ul>
<li>Investing
     in state of the art technology</li>
<li> Supporting on-going training of our
     medical staff</li>
<li>Opening
     mammography facilities in remote areas</li>
<li>Implementing
     awareness campaigns</li>
<li>Fighting
     for legislation that will allow women to have a ""day off"" to see
     their gynecologist and have a mammogram done. </li>
<li>Partnering
     other NGO'S to rapidly reach women in need.</li>
<li>Donating
     mammograms (8000 mammograms donated in the last 5 years)</li>
</ul>
<p>Our aim is to <b>PREVENT
WOMEN FROM DYING OF BREAST CANCER</b>, starting in Argentina and expanding
later to the rest of Latin America. It’s a moon shot but we are working
tremendously hard and are very focused on this cause.</p>
<p>Helping people fulfills me in every possible way so I'm
taking every chance I have to tackle this huge social problem. </p>
<p>Because I have had 3 surgical operations on my right knee I went
through a lots of pain so in 2013 I decided to do something totally
“counterintuitive” to solve my problem:  <b>training for marathons</b>…10 months after
I started the hard traning sessions the pain was gone. Since then, I have managed<b> to  succesfully 
ran in Paris, Berlin and Buenos Aires supporting the fight against
breast cancer</b>. </p>
<p>This year, in 3 weeks (april the 26th), I'll be running the <b>London Marathon</b> in an attempt to raise
money to donate mammograms to <b>women, in
Argentina, who are not covered by the national healthcare system and don't have
any financial resources</b>. </p>
<p><b>Together with CARITAS</b>,
the well established charitable organization whose core mission is helping poor
families, <b>we are going to use the money
raised to offer women at risk , in the province of Corrientes (northern
Argentina), the possibility of having a mammogram</b>…Women who may never have
had a mammogram in their entire lives, women who may  never have heard about breast cancer, women
who might die of this dreadful disease. </p>
<p><b>The GOAL of this
campaign is to raise 15.000 USD (10.000 GBP) and donate 222 mammograms</b>. This means
that <b>for every 67 USD (45 GBP) you donate, you

<p>If we can’t raise the funds for the 222 mammograms, we’ll be
donating less mammograms but <b>COME ON!!!</b> Together, we can do this! During 2014
we managed to raise money for 2000 mammograms which are being donated in 2015.</p>
<p>If you don’t have the money to help these women but you

believe we can make powerful compelling stories worthy of the big screen and it’s

powerful directors and any position we want, we can have. </p>
<p>For
the last few years I have been trying to bring a feature film alive because it
is my dream as an artist and a woman to direct powerful, moving films and I
will do whatever it takes to get there. I have come close several times but I
either get stopped by sexually harassing producers or crazy investors with
different agendas, or nay-sayers; “You want to make a movie about sex
trafficking? Nobody is going to watch that.” Well isn’t that a problem on its
own? </p>
<p>I’m
not trying to force my agenda down your throat, but nobody will get hurt by
being more aware of what is going on in the world around you (It might actually

<p>My
name is Anne Leigh Cooper AKA Annemijn Nieuwkoop (My real Dutch name) and I
have been an artist for as long as I can remember. I moved to the USA when I
was 18, all by myself to pursue a career as an actor (Which I still luckily do)
but when I got out of acting school here in NYC I knew it wasn’t going to be an
easy road and I figured what if I make my own project as a director? And so I
went, I emptied my bank account, wrote a script and thought of every talented
person I had come across my young years in New York and invited them to be a
part of my first film “Where there is no Light’. It was an Official Selection
at the Women Film Festival in Austin, a true events story about a woman who
goes to the end of the world to save her sister from a sex trafficking ring. It
was the best experience and learning curve I could have ever hoped for but what
I didn’t realize what had happened was that I had completely and utterly fallen
in love with directing. So I kept on going and I directed “$tockholm Syndroom”;
an experimental short about the mind-bending journey a sex slave suffering from
Stockholm Syndrome experiences. Then “Anti-Woman” about a woman’s right to say “no”
when ever, where ever, and finally “A Caged Innocence”; a story of two women in
love hoping to create a family in a world where that is not allowed. Now after
making 4 short films I am ready to sink my teeth in a feature length film.</p>

<div>SEA MONSTERS is primarily a love story. It's the tale of an old, dying sea captain on one final journey to reunite with his one true love.

<h3>The Impact</h3> <p>As I sat and watched the <b>Banff Mountain Film Festival</b> World Tour this year, I saw once again how sharing a journey like this tends to inspire people to take action and do great things.  As a Personal Trainer and Coach, my life's work is to inspire people to create a healthy body and a great life.  If this film can help people do that, mission accomplished.  I think of how my friend, Dr Stacy Larsen talked with such passion about triathlon in 2004, that I decided to try one.  From there I have gone from Sprint Triathlon to Ultraman, and along the way, coached over 100 people to realize their goals.  So what could happen if a film could inspire thousands of people to chase their dreams?</p>

</div></div>","Short Summary Our goal is to laugh and cheer while you witness what it takes to prepare for a MASSIVE race, to inspire and motivate others to live a great life, and to show my Mom what I do.  She is in her 80's and after extensive heart surgery, has never, and will never see me race.
In 2010 I was training for my 4th Ironman and I met a man (Nick Mallet) who had raced (and won) Ultraman Canada.  I thought he was fully nuts, but as the conversation continued, I found myself very curious.  Day 1: A 10km (6.2 mi) swim followed by a 145km (90.6mi) bike.  Day 2: A 276km (172.5mi) bike.  Day 3: Run a double marathon, 84.4kms (52.8mi).  
No way....but maybe.....  
A year later I raced Ultraman Canada and placed 6th over all!  In 2013 I made it to the Ultraman World Championships and during what was the single hardest 3 days of my life, (in fact, any one of the days qualified as hardest) I had a total BLAST and made some incredible friends en route to a 21st place overall finish.


I am applying to go back to Kona to race the world championships in 2015 and along the way, working with a film maker to capture the whole experience, from training to racing, and submit it to the Banff Mountain Film Festival.

most important aspect of every movie and needs to be secured prior to or during

<div>The Team of Carpe Diem...Greg Washington, John W. Chambers, &amp; Clint McCommon....we have a strong history of making films and completing projects.  Funding out of our own pockets we have sucessfully created the first finished Web Series in Louisiana, and the First Web Series Ever to feature an Emmy Award Winning Actor (Pruitt Taylor Vince) - Infamous Web Series - was distributed and received national attention with award nominations and Emmy Award Winners in the Cast.  Now after several sucessful projects and 5 years of experience under our belts we are hitting the creative pavement again with Carpe Diem and for the first time reaching out to help produce this larger than life thrill ride of a short film.</div> <p>Carpe Diem - Seize The Day.  Time...it is our enemy and something that can be wasted so easily.  Carpe Diem is an action packed extraordinary look at how the day can get away from you.  This dark action-adventure comedy lets you escape reality while dealing with a very real ticking of a clock....Carpe Diem, you never know when your time is up!</p>
<p>Helping us create professional content with a team of creative artists, many of whom are currently working on WGN SALEM SEASON 2 along with Post-Production Support from one of the editors of the upcoming film South Paw, will create both jobs and something we can all be proud of.  The first stop on our debut will be the Louisiana Film Prize as we make our rounds and contend with other top professionals around the world in many more Film Festivals that we have lined up.  </p>
<p>We believe in the idea of Carpe Diem, and the dream of doing the most with the little time you have and with this in mind, once the goal is reached, a large portion of anything over that goal will go to Capes 4 Heroes, a foundation that is dear to our hearts and to the memory of one of our dearest and closest friend and colleague Micheal Ward.  This campaign is as much about helping others as it is about living the moment creatively.</p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>Carpe Diem needs simply $15,000.00 US Dollars to bring everything to life.  The money will go to the many aspects of Production and Post-Production that is needed.  From Location Cost to Paid Actors, Crew, and Equipment.  Every dollar has been broken down to get the most out of the production.  Food cost alone for six days of production is high, and with the idea that a professional crew member should be paid for their creative work, we are attempting to give back to the wonderful film family that we all know and love in our community.  This creates jobs and income for artists while making something we can all be proud of and that has interest across the film world.  Any and all props and things that can be used afterwards will go to a local charity in need.</p>
<p>After we reach this goal, a large portion of the funds raised will be donated to Capes 4 Heroes.  It is a project that we are passionate about and something that has touched so many children and is a big part of who we are and what we believe in.</p>
<p>The Perks!!!!!!  SWAG!  Everyone loves it! And we have some great items...from a simple bracelet to VIP passes to the LA Film Prize and even a Gold....or at least golden....watch!  That's right, we have gotten serious with our swag....swagger in style and be a producer with us and truly Carpe Diem!</p>
<p>Finally, if the goals are not reached...we are still producing this puppy...two heads and all!  To show our determination, we have already begun Production and believe in putting our money where our mouths are.  We are working around the clock on other sets and films to bring in enough to make this happen and will push forward to Carpe Diem everything!  The money raised here will allow us to add more in every area from Production to Post-Production and to the distribution of the film.  Even if you give $5.00 you will see this film be made!  We believe in completing what we start and have done so with several productions over the years...it is what we do and we would love to have you along for the ride!</p> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>Carpe Diem will allow for working professional Actors &amp; Crew to be just that...working.  The money raised will impact over 45 individuals for over 3 months.  Money raised over our goal will impact children across the country by the donations raised for Capes4Heroes.  All props and bought items that can be used by families will go to donations for local shelters.  Capre Diem is about Seizing the Day and we believe with that, everyone should give back.  </p>
<p>The teams track record for completion and success out of our own pockets and lean project development has created the First Web Series ever finished in The State of Louisisana, the countries Number 3 spot for film and TV.  We have been nominated for several awards and have worked on productions outside of our own that include Olympus Has Fallen, True Blood, SALEM, Jonah Hex, and many more.  Our Filmography is expansive as a team and is one that we are very proud of.  This year alone we have won over 10 awards for featured commercial and web based work for companies across the industry.  Our campaigns are noted for not only being creative, but in giving back to the community and those in need.  </p>
<p>One person can make a difference in the world....we have a team.  Not only is this a story that is different than any other short film out there, but it is a project that will affect those that work on it, and those outside of the the team.  Monies raised will promote growth in film, allow for creative achievement and promote organizations that need help.  Giving as much as we receive is our goal and something we are now looking to take to the next level with Crowd Funding.</p> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>Seizing The Day entails grabbing a dream and holding on to it, no matter what.  But being smart about it is what we do.  Risk and Challenges on this project include everything from the lean Production and Post-Production to the overall goal of creating entertainment and making a social impact with the success of the project.  Working in Video Production over the last few years on a Local and Regional level has honed our skill in keeping things under budget and completing the impossible.  Many times we have completed projects for half the price then other companies, in half the time, and created something that is over the top in production and quality.  We have been extensive in Pre-Production, have a dedicated team, and know the ropes to solving problems on the fly.  Constant Morning Meetings and Updates are key to this and communication with our audience and participation and working with festivals will be the goal of our success.  We have many more hurdles from Art Work, Promotion, and Post-Production Special Effects to cover.  Your donation will keep this on track and under budget and our track record of creating something from nothing will provide the road map.</p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p>We have donated to other campaigns in the past and sometimes we come across some amazing projects that we would love to get behind, but are unable to.  It happens.  But don't sweat it!  Be a supporter of the project and get the word out to as many people that you can everyday by clicking and sharing Carpe Diem and our campaign.  The more the word gets out the more we can do as a community.  We are all part of this beautiful Collective Conscience of Artists and those that can inspire.  Seize The Day, Carpe Diem, and support!</p>

    Other Ways You Can Help We have donated to other campaigns in the past and sometimes we come across some amazing projects that we would love to get behind, but are unable to.  It happens.  But don't sweat it!  Be a supporter of the project and get the word out to as many people that you can everyday by clicking and sharing Carpe Diem and our campaign.  The more the word gets out the more we can do as a community.  We are all part of this beautiful Collective Conscience of Artists and those that can inspire.  Seize The Day, Carpe Diem, and support!",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

</div></div>","Safeto. . .  technology works to create safety nets for you and your loved ones, this technology enables you to have our profile searcher across your devices, searching the names and profiles of those you are talking to.Do you want to know if the person you are chatting to online has been convicted of child molestation? How about if the daughters new boyfriend has a history of domestic violence? Does the tradesman dropping by have a criminal record? Your child's new online buddy, is there an ulterior motive behind them? We will help you to find these answers.These checks are a background search on any person whom you interact with. All of our members can make unlimited searches. We at Safeto... don't just focus on Child Sex Offenders and Domestic Violence offences we also focus on offenders who have records for Fraud, Murder, Sex Offences, Serial Killers, Stalkers and an array of Internet Offences, we believe our systems are more superior because they work better, for the public's needs and the offender's, we are the only company that collate these offences for this specific outcome giving us the ability to have non intrusive public searching within the base and allowing you to search . . Safeto. . . the only company striving to link real people to profiles and verify  them as safe, so you and your children can interact with safer connections online and in real time.Safeto. . . the only company striving to verify every business' on and offline, targeting those companies who deal with  real customers within there service's - the outcome is a verification that consumers deserve -  knowing the business' you deal with are working in the best interest for you and having that information at your fingertips in easy to see and understandable format is paramount.Simple colour coded results on any person and profile searched.

Profilebuddy and how this tool would have helped this situation.Recently in Australia, a Families SA employer was jailed for three decades, he worked with hundreds of children over a period of years and had molested, abused and filmed his atrocities that he inflicted upon his child victims.  Both colleagues and members of the public admitted to noticing that 'things weren't right' but had no way of acting upon a hunch. He was also a 'KING-PIN' and creator of a massive underworld global paedophile ring with hundreds of members swapping images.This is just one person that was trusted within our community - researching these issues for the past four years, we have collected over 350,000 convicted criminals, the majority of which were entrusted as teachers, sports coaches, taxi drivers, child care workers and even the tradesmen that you invite into your home.Another situation recently where Datebuddy would have helped.A man allegedly tried to kidnap and murder two female backpackers in South Australian bush land. Police found and arrested the 59-year-old man from Adelaide, about two hours north-east from the site of the alleged attempted kidnapping. We also encourage our community to report incidents as we believe the key is within the small things. 

More Australians than ever are falling victim to identity crime and the victims aren’t signing up to dodgy scams or being careless either. Safeto. . . helps you interact with others safely and be safe to interact with on and off line.Our unique verification system will reduce these devastating statistics.
While children are hiding this from their parents, who do they turn to if they encounter a paedophile or stalker? Where can they report that incident without being 'told off'?

""In Australia there were 3600 Paedophile profiler's procuring kids online over 90 days from one state alone."" 
These children are being HUNTED, by people who can amass hundreds and thousands of aliases and be totally anonymous - UNTIL NOW!




SEXUAL assaults and related offences committed by school-aged children have almost quadrupled in four years.
Australian Bureau of Statistics figures show that between 2007 and 2011 the number of offences jumped from 430 to 1709 across the nation. 
Experts believe the greater and easier access children now have to pornographic material via the internet is playing a role in the worrying trend.
The ABS figures also showed a near 100 per cent jump in school-aged children committing acts intended to cause injury between 2007 and 2011 - from 5621 to 11,085.




In 2012 almost 30,000 more criminal offences were committed in Victoria, with massive hikes in drug offences, family violence and assaults, statistics show.
Drug offences jumped a worrying 20.7 per cent, assaults have shot up by 14.2 per cent, family violence skyrocketed 37 per cent, and overall crimes have risen 11.3 per cent.
A simple verification system, ran for the safety of the public, by the public.


WE BELIEVE PREVENTION IS BETTER THAN CURE.
We are a dedicated group of passionate people, and have been working on our system (and your safety) for over 4 years. In this time we have seen growth and opportunity, pushing the project from being a useful tool in the online dating game to helping parents try to get a handle of children online gaming and interacting online with an array of unknown's in chat rooms and forums - to now being a  much sought after requirement for real time interactions off line also with hundreds of scenario's that it can be used for including never before real-time instant verification.



Imagine if all it took was a glance whilst your child's gaming online with 'friends' to see that they are visibly verified!  We are creating THE universal online identity mark. 
We believe we have the key, but not just for our mission


The Office of Police Integrity wants Vic Police stripped of data control
They were accused of recording crimes as cleared
But up to 15000 per year were actually unsolved

The director of OPI said ""the situation was so bad that consideration should be given to creating a new body ""external to and independent of Victoria Police to compile, analyse and publish crime statistics"".





Imagine if we also made a tool that you could enter a future meeting, trip away or date that included:




We did. . .  and we integrated even more safety features for you! 
Emergencies can happen in many and varied formsWe believe having the technology at you fingertips to call for help, send location and emails to emergency contacts in times of a questionable interaction, incident or an accident, is crucial. We have added an emergency call and or email feature for your contacts.A fast easy way to check on more personal interactions. . many criminals try to integrate back into our society without telling the whole truth of where and what there own background history is -Safeto... never delete information or 'times out' offenders records. Most searches for offenders records online disappear after 3 months, and private searches are costly per 24 hour period and are not always guaranteed - no other company offers extensive all history inclusive searches unlimited for a fraction of cost.A May 2015 report by the institute found parents were the third most frequent group of victims of family homicides, behind partners and children.Between 2002-03 and 2011-12, 134 parents were murdered by their children — a crime known as parricide. Ten incidents resulted in the deaths of both parents. These children are released after a life sentence - generally around 25 years.By way of comparison, 654 people were murdered by their domestic partner in the same period, and 238 children were killed by their parent or parents. There were 40 victims of sibling homicide between 2002 and 2012.The dashboard is your home base at Safeto, complete with tips to keep safe on and off line. We have links for members in crisis, and we will run moderated forums and encourage all members to discuss many and varied topics. We will run our competitions through the home dashboard as well as any partnerships offering coupons, to help us encourage our members to meet in public areas. 



Through your input the app can check on the criminal status of those you meet and if you meet strangers on the way you can add them and also check real time if they are safe to travel with.
If for some reason you don't make it to the next arrival point our tools will alert you to check in 3 times before it emails or texts an emergency with a message of your choice.

Safeto... brings to you a world of security
We believe having closed databases and allowing individuals to make specific searches within it, looking for only people they personally have interactions with is the key to help maintain a nameless shameless and blameless society. 
Studies show that open registers can be more counter productive to society, and can cause offender's to re-offend with worse than before outcomes to enable longer jail terms. 

 

If you have experienced something on or offline - share it with us so we can help the next person who interacts with them.

Insurance-This is essential, this covers not only the actors but also the equipment we are using and the public.
Equipment-Hire of camera and lenses (Alexi 6k), Steadicam hire, Dolly and tracking, lighting and sound equipment.
Costume/Makeup and Art Direction. We have some fabulous exterior locations in the Derbyshire Dales, and also some wonderful interior locations, but we will still need to dress them appropriately, this is essential alongside the costume and the makeup for the Mise En Scene of the film.
Expenses. This area covers everything from accommodating a small crew and cast, food, travel costs and any location fees.
You will find a variation of perks we have to offer, these vary accordingly to donation pledges.
    Cast And Crew We are extremely lucky to have both experienced crew and cast involved in the project, here is a little more about the people involved.

I am extremely keen to see the production of quality Christian films and documentaries, <i>especially ones made by Christians who understand what a Christian worldview is!</i> One of my primary objectives is to make God's role in History known, emphasised and appreciated, as it is so often obscured and downplayed in contemporary documentaries, and historical films. </li>

The former warden also explains how he, and the other staff members survived and coped with a job which involved confronting death on a daily basis, and how their Christian faith proved to be a huge help.

Victor Racing: a drag racing team from Wolverhampton, England. </p>

<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">The 50-minute feature showcases the hard-work, determination, time and skill that went into achieving the life-long dream of owner and driver; Andy Frost.</span></p>

<p></p>
<p>Now, this is where our second film begins.  In 2014 Andy Frost's incredible world record of 6.40 seconds was smashed twice by American driver; Larry Larson, who out-ran Red Victor 3 in his modified Chevy pickup by 0.24 seconds.  A few weeks later Larson lowered that record even further by running an incredible 5.95 seconds at 244mph - making it a world's first.</p>
<p></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""326"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2F1yVnho0xqow%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3D1yVnho0xqow&amp;image=http%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2F1yVnho0xqow%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube"" width=""580""></iframe></div><br/><p></p>

<p>5 seconds in a street car was previously unthinkable and is a remarkable achievement for Larson and his racing team.  Now, obviously Andy was not going to take this one lying down but it was going to cost him a lot of money and time to get RV3 running into the 5s.  It seemed impossible.  And for a while the future of Red Victor 3 looked bleak.</p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">What happened next is nothing short of a miracle: a fan set up a secret Facebook page to raise funds for the work that was going to be needed to get Andy Frost's  Vauxhall Victor ready to take on Larry Larson’s Chevy truck.  The response was overwhelming.  In just a few weeks hundreds of fans donated and raised the money needed to get RV3 back in the game. </span></p>
<p>So, what next?  </p>
<p>Our next film will document Red Victor's come back.  Long-time rivals Frost and Larson will battle it out to  see who really can drive the fastest down the quarter-mile.  A story of national pride, deep rivalry, high speeds and spiralling costs, can our man Andy reclaim his title?</p>

**UPDATE** Many thanks to our new sponsor. The next film will be presented by Race Flow Development.
Hi, my name is Jay Davies and I am the video guy for Red
Victor Racing: a drag racing team from Wolverhampton, England. 
For the past couple of years I have followed the story of Red Victor 3 in its quest to become the fastest street legal car in the world.
In 2013 I made a film (shown above) called Red Victor 3 - The World's Fastest Street Legal Car.  It followed the team during their world record breaking season, when Andy extended his record 3 times in the same season. 
The 50-minute feature showcases the hard-work, determination, time and skill that went into achieving the life-long dream of owner and driver; Andy Frost.


The Story

Now, this is where our second film begins.  In 2014 Andy Frost's incredible world record of 6.40 seconds was smashed twice by American driver; Larry Larson, who out-ran Red Victor 3 in his modified Chevy pickup by 0.24 seconds.  A few weeks later Larson lowered that record even further by running an incredible 5.95 seconds at 244mph - making it a world's first.


5 seconds in a street car was previously unthinkable and is a remarkable achievement for Larson and his racing team.  Now, obviously Andy was not going to take this one lying down but it was going to cost him a lot of money and time to get RV3 running into the 5s.  It seemed impossible.  And for a while the future of Red Victor 3 looked bleak.
What happened next is nothing short of a miracle: a fan set up a secret Facebook page to raise funds for the work that was going to be needed to get Andy Frost's  Vauxhall Victor ready to take on Larry Larson’s Chevy truck.  The response was overwhelming.  In just a few weeks hundreds of fans donated and raised the money needed to get RV3 back in the game. 
So, what next?  
Our next film will document Red Victor's come back.  Long-time rivals Frost and Larson will battle it out to  see who really can drive the fastest down the quarter-mile.  A story of national pride, deep rivalry, high speeds and spiralling costs, can our man Andy reclaim his title?

What We Need & What You Get
By pledging funds you will be helping to make this film happen.  I make these films because I admire Andy Frost and his story.  No one is paid and it is a group effort.  Making films is also very time consuming, with the first taking around 2 full months to edit and produce.  But this is a story that should be told and I really hope you agree. 
The money would go towards camera and audio equipment,fuel, general running costs, and supplies.I will also be able to maintain my 1984 Dodge Day-van which is used as filming HQ, living and sleeping accommodation while on location.  


Anything
beyond our goal would be truly incredible and would mean we'd be able to carry on making videos in the future.
As soon as the target is reached, I will head to Penn Autos (the home of Red Victor 3) and start filming - ideally by end of Feb 2015.  During filming I will edit and upload mini
episodes capturing the rebuilding of the car, engine fitting, tuning and the run-up to RV3's new world record attempts.

  




The next films look
I am hoping to achieve a more cinematic look and style in this next film, similar to this one below that I shot on location at Santa Pod several years ago: 'Combustion'.

<p>While this will be a Magic Mirror Production, we are working together with others in the entertainment industry who feel as we do, that a disability or impairment should NOT be a factor in the decision to accept or reject a new performer. We are excited to have the support of Grammy Winning Song Writer and Producer Gary S. Paxton, Sr.,who has been working for years towards a goal of a music school specifically for children with disabilities, and of Ronnie Hurst of BreakThru Entertainment, a talent agency that specializes in the representation of Handi-Capable artists.</p>
<p>Mr. Paxton's commitment stems from a bout with spinal meningitis that he suffered as a child, which left him with limited control over his body and caused people to reject him as a performer until he hit upon the notion of using his jerky movements to create a whole new style of performance guitar. He was so successful that he became known as the ""Elvis of Tucson,"" and guitar players have been imitating him ever since! His enthusiasm and energy are what made him a star, and can be felt in the theme song that he has written and provided for this program.</p>
<p>Mr. Hurst found his own interest when a recording of one of his songs was sent to a major record producer in Nashville, who instantly expressed interest. However, when they were shown a photograph of him, and realized that he was born with no arms and only one leg, they immediately rescinded their offer of a recording contract, claiming that due to his condition and appearance, he was simply not marketable. The pain of this rejection led him to create his agency, BreakThru Entertainment, with the intent of representing artists with disabilities.</p>

<p></p>
<p>""Handi-Capable"" will be a web-based television program, formatted like most other talent programs, with contestants gathered to a central location where they are coached, encouraged and mentored to help them give the best performance they can. Contestants will perform as musicians, singers, dancers, comics and actors, and there may be special categories, as well.</p>
<p>In each weeks episode, some contestants will be voted off and will return home, while others will move on toward the grand prize<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""> which, as with most such programs, will include  a valuable promotion and management package with Magic Mirror and a touring schedule. All of the top twelve contestants will share in these prizes, though the first place winner will receive the lion's share.</span></p>
<p></p>
<h3>The Plan</h3>
<p></p>
<p>There will be celebrity judges on the panel, including Mr. Paxton, Mr. Hurst and others. Currently the leading candidate for Hostess of the program is Rachael Burns, who is the current Miss Texas International. Ms. Burns would be exceptional in this position, since she herself has suffered severe hearing loss and therefore knows firsthand the stigma that is attached to even the slightest type of challenge.</p>
<p>We currently plan to hold auditions in late spring/early summer, in the following twelve cities:</p>

<p><b>SYNOPSIS</b></p>
<p>Beautiful 18 year old <b>ELSA</b> is in her senior year of high school. The recent death of her mother has darkened Elsa's usually bright persona.  When her step father has to go to the Middle East,  Elsa is sent to live with her quirky step-relatives who live in their own world.  <b>MARCIA GARTH</b> is a widow who treats her 20 something sons, <b>EMERY</b> and <b>TAB</b>, like 10 year old boys.  She is a failed musician who has nurtured Tab's musical talent and they dream of touring the world.  Emery is salt of the earth, the Cinderella of the family, who keeps the old house functioning and restores antiques to bring in money.  </p>
<p>Marcia ridicules Elsa's behavior and modern ways.  Gradually, Elsa befriends the two brothers and they fall madly in love with her - thus shattering Marcia's perfect triangle.  Will Marcia's tyrannical grip on her ""boys"" destroy budding young love?  Stay tuned and find out.</p>

The Impact

I believe in great storytelling and creating theater, film and visuals with emotional impact is my life's goal.  ""Out of State - A Gothic Romance"" is about young love that is threatened by parental control run amuck. The film has universal appeal and will resonate with young adults 16+.  I write from experience.  Like Elsa, I fell in love for the first time while living with a family in Argentina.  As a foreign exchange student I was forbidden to continue my love affair and faced threats of being sent away to the north country or deported.  It was a heartbreaking experience and I didn't understand how loving someone could be so wrong.

Film, video and theater are collaborative art forms.  From working in theater I've developed a talent for storytelling, character development and dialogue.  As a director I give actors tremendous space to practice their craft.   ""Out of State A Gothic Romance"" is my debut feature film.  
While working with Bill Marpet, Director, and Andy Biskin, Producer, at B Productions of New York for 15 years, I produced countless videos for our fashion, beauty and entertainment clients.  This includes  Starz TV Special ""Murphy Brown - The 25th Anniversary Reunion,"" CBS ""The Making of Fashion's Night Out"" mega runway show at Lincoln Center, Conde Nast's ""Wedding March on Madison,"" Mercedes Benz ""New York Fashion Week,""GQ's ""Mens Trends Video Wall in Las Vegas,"" and shot a documentary ""Crobar - The Making of a MegaClub,"" with ""Out of State A Gothic Romance"" producer Cherie Fortis.

his daily life. </p>
<p>Choice
will always design and develop its own unique style of content. We will rarely

change and evolve to fit our reader’s needs and tastes. But it will always be
unique and specialized. </p>

within reach of the modern gentleman.

What is
Choice Magazine? It is the modern gentleman’s magazine. But what is the modern
Gentleman? Who is the modern gentleman? In this modern age never like never

Accomplished but Humble. Choice Magazine aspires to be the new voice, the new
platform for the modern Gentleman.  
We need
your support to bring Choice Magazine to the world! Choice Magazine is a new
and exciting Gentleman’s Magazine. A GQ meets Playboy.  Choice Magazine will be a portal for the
modern sophisticated man. We are not a Juvenile simplistic portrayal of the

will offer unique and exclusive content to its readers, ranging from Fashion,
Art and Culture, Dating and Relationships, Tech and Toys, and yes plenty Female
Beauties. As well as everything in between to inspire and entertain the modern
man as well as our other readers and supporters.

content, we also know that like the modern gentleman our Magazine will need to
grow and evolve.  We hope to bring to our
readers content and imagery that not only entertains you but inspires you and
helps the modern gentleman get along with better ease in his daily life. While

to experiencing the place as possible.</p>

This is truly a bare-bones budget, but a contribution of this amount is just
about enough to deliver a product whose quality we will be satisfied with. The

<p>The money we’ve budgeted may appear rather insufficient, but we
plan to make do with renting or buying second-hand vehicles, carrying essentials
from home, and skimping on stay. We’ve even done away with medical costs that
may be incurred! If we manage to exceed the pledge, we will focus on spending the
money on the delivering a better product… think an additional drone, newer
places, etc.  Our perks are meant not just to fulfill the requirement
of having rewards and promotions, but to hand every backer a product that each
of us is personally invested in and very proud of!

<p><span>In the event of us not meeting our desired target of US$14,500
(these things happen in crowdfunding!), we plan to use the funds we receive to
execute our lofty plan anyway. We might have to make compromises regarding
location, mode of transportation or the amount invested in post production;  but we are committed to doing the best we can
with the funds at hand.</span></p>

<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">There is a rather important reason behind our choosing to embark
on this project. The four of us have spent our adolescence and youth watching
beautiful, moving movies, listening to music that has made our heart sing and forced
us to wonder at the intent of the artist, reading books and editorials that
have taken us straight to the place of action, and staring at pictures that
have frozen moments in time (think Nat Geo’s Afghan Woman). Most of these
life-impacting works of art, however, have originated from places away from
home. Beginning a few generations before ours, India has seemed to find greater
appeal in absorbing media that has been produced outside. India, a large, complex country with one of the biggest, most
diverse populations in the world, has continually produced art and
entertainment for the ‘masses’ – as opposed to the ‘classes’, for purely
commercial reasons. We believe that art and entertainment can be packaged
smartly and aesthetically while still being commercially viable. And since we
are ourselves of the ‘masses’, we are aware that there is increasing demand for
– and interest in – high quality productions.  </span><br/></p>

<p>Individually, each of us brings into this project what we’ve learned from our
professional experiences. Nishanth’s experience as Locations Assistant on the
award-winning movie Life of Pi and as Assistant Director on a number of films,
his technical expertise and the innumerable valuable life lessons learnt from
his many years in the field of filmmaking are certain to enrich Send it’s video
endeavour. Ravikiran has travelled across our subcontinent looking for beauty
in places often overlooked by the hasty tourist or the daily commuter,
punctuating his travels with the most potent of images. With his keen eye,
sense of adventure and his trusty camera, the photobook will be a treasure
trove of untold stories and eloquent sights. The sounds of south Asia are
certain to be documented most creatively; Tapass’ versatility as a drummer is
well known, and he has experimented widely with music ranging from Indian film
to old-fashioned rock ’n’ roll. Finally, Arjun’s insatiable and voracious
appetite for books, and his great ambition of writing, coupled with his experience
in the advertising world, cannot but yield an unputdownable and engrossing book
on the foursome’s travels through great new exotic lands waiting to be
chronicled. </p>

<p>Our biggest challenge remains the fact that we are taking
on the unknown. We plan to travel to four countries we know next to nothing
about, and the enormous language barrier is certain to prove daunting. As far
as production goes, laying a strong foundation and building on it thereafter is
a formidable task for any first-time endeavour. There is good news however, India is a vast country in itself, with hundreds of diverse cultures, religions
and languages. In our previous journeys across our own country, we have encountered
completely alien customs and people. Our travels have taught us that people are,
irrespective of their region or faith, by and large the same, and have always
done their best to accommodate us and make sure we feel safe and comfortable. We
have, in turn, learnt to ensure not to offend them or overstep boundaries. We are
confident that Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos and Thailand will be no different in
this respect.

</p>
<p><span>Starting off on a new endeavour is a giant lesson in
self-dependence, and we have questioned ourselves relentlessly on our ability

experts in domains that we remain uninitiated into, and who’ve watched us like
hawks, guiding us along the way.</span></p>

<p></p></div>","We – Arjun, Nishanth, Ravikiran and Tapass – are the guys behind
Send It Sideways, a new media venture based out of Chennai, India. The four of
us plan to travel to Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos and Thailand in 30 days on three
motorcycles and one utility vehicle, and document our experiences of the new peoples,
cultures and lifestyles we encounter using the mediums of music, photography,
film and the written word.

Through our travels, we hope to provide a fresh perspective on the countries
that neighbour us, and believe that our Indian backgrounds will be hugely
helpful in our doing so. The four of us plan to embark on this great journey of
discovery with no backup vehicles, crew or diplomatic support.

It is our combined professional backgrounds and varied skill sets in the media
and entertainment industry that has given us the confidence to plan and embark
on this admittedly ambitious but exciting endeavour. More importantly, each one
of us is hugely interested in meeting new people and sampling the local cuisine,
not to forget adventurous (and foolish!) enough to take the road less travelled!

Our primary goal is to have everyone experience these lands with us, and
encourage more people to travel; there is nothing quite as educative and enriching
as travelling out of one’s comfort zones – one expands one’s horizons &
perspectives.


We realise that this project is much bigger than us, but we are ready to commit
to doing everything to see it materialise. Through Indiegogo, we would like you
to participate in the idea; after all, the greater the overall contribution,
the more we can do!



   

We are asking for US$ 14,500 to bring out a documentary, photobook, music album and travelogue, all of which will capture the sights, sounds
and smells of these beautiful countries from all angles, and get you as close
to experiencing the place as possible.

This is truly a bare-bones budget, but a contribution of this amount is just
about enough to deliver a product whose quality we will be satisfied with. The
budget is broken-down as below:

The money we’ve budgeted may appear rather insufficient, but we
plan to make do with renting or buying second-hand vehicles, carrying essentials
from home, and skimping on stay. We’ve even done away with medical costs that
may be incurred! If we manage to exceed the pledge, we will focus on spending the
money on the delivering a better product… think an additional drone, newer
places, etc.  Our perks are meant not just to fulfill the requirement
of having rewards and promotions, but to hand every backer a product that each
of us is personally invested in and very proud of!


In the event of us not meeting our desired target of US$14,500
(these things happen in crowdfunding!), we plan to use the funds we receive to
execute our lofty plan anyway. We might have to make compromises regarding
location, mode of transportation or the amount invested in post production;  but we are committed to doing the best we can
with the funds at hand.







There is a rather important reason behind our choosing to embark
on this project. The four of us have spent our adolescence and youth watching
beautiful, moving movies, listening to music that has made our heart sing and forced
us to wonder at the intent of the artist, reading books and editorials that
have taken us straight to the place of action, and staring at pictures that
have frozen moments in time (think Nat Geo’s Afghan Woman). Most of these
life-impacting works of art, however, have originated from places away from
home. Beginning a few generations before ours, India has seemed to find greater
appeal in absorbing media that has been produced outside. India, a large, complex country with one of the biggest, most
diverse populations in the world, has continually produced art and
entertainment for the ‘masses’ – as opposed to the ‘classes’, for purely
commercial reasons. We believe that art and entertainment can be packaged
smartly and aesthetically while still being commercially viable. And since we
are ourselves of the ‘masses’, we are aware that there is increasing demand for
– and interest in – high quality productions.

<p>Offroading with Luke &amp; Eddie is a Jeep/Offroad Family. Over the past two years our Family has grown to over 12,000. It doesn't matter if you drive a Jeep or not, doesn't matter if it's lifted or stock, doesn't matter if you get it muddy or not. What we are all about is a welcoming place for all in the Jeep/Offroad Community.</p>
<p>Offroading with Luke &amp; Eddie currently host two yearly Jeep events, The Romp in the Swamp held on the Eastern Shore of Maryland in April and the Outer Banks Jeep Mutiny held on the Outer Banks, NC in September. We are currently working on two more locations and will be adding more events for 2016.</p>
<p>Our next phase is to bring or family all of our Adventures. What we are doing is creating a video journal of the Adventures of Offroading with Luke &amp; Eddie. As we travel and even in our everyday lives we run into all kinds of great people that are part of the Jeep/Offroad Community. We have the opportunity to travel to Jeep events and see some awesome rigs and meet new people. We also have formed relationships with different manufactures and dealers of products that we all use for our rigs. We intend to bring all this information to our family in the form of interviews with manufactures, product reviews, interviews with guys and gals that built their rigs, event coverage, wrenchin tips and anything else we can get ourselves into all presented as only the Offroading with Luke &amp; Eddie Family could do it.   </p> Any of you that have met us know we are just regular guys who love their Jeeps and the great friendship we have made over the past two years. We want to continue to grow our family and provide that Offroading with Luke &amp; Eddie entertainment and knowledge that so many have grown to love.  </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>
</p>
<p>Over the past year we have been capturing action from different events with
3 GoPro cameras and although they are great cameras for capturing action they
have their limitations.  All of the interviews that we have attempted
to film to put this show together have not been of the quality that we would
put our names on. The sound quality is very poor and waiting until you get back
to a computer to make sure you got the shot is nothing more than hit or miss. </p>
<p>Also the production and promotion costs are extremely high and for us to be
able to get this product out we need help.</p>
<p>We need to purchase at least two professional video cameras
and a minimum of four wireless microphone set ups to go with the cameras. This
will give us the ability to film in high quality and capture the audio in a
professional manner. Once we have the footage we will be able to get assistance
in producing and editing the footage and putting it together in an entertaining
format for everyone to enjoy. We also will be able to promote the show and
drive more traffic to it and gain more regular viewers. </p>
<p>We have come up with a few ideas for those that are able to
help us and will be exclusive to this campaign. First and most importantly any
and all help will be greatly appreciated and you will know that because of your
help we are able to move forward and The Adventures of Offroading with Luke
&amp; Eddie will be dedicated to each and every one of you.</p>

<p>As you may know, I have been working with the International Design 
Clinic since 2009 when they were based in Philadelphia, creating architectural urban interventions throughout
 the United States and in Bolivia. Our humanitarian design/build work 
has been recognized internationally including at the U.S. Pavilion at 
the 2012 Venice Biennale ""Spontaneous Interventions: Design Actions for 
the Common Good"" and currently on display at the Museum of Modern Art in
 New York City at the ""Uneven Growth"" exhibition. (<a href=""http://uneven-growth.moma.org/post/100197648883/chainlinkgreen-is-a-system-of-construction"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://uneven-growth.moma.org/post/100197648883...</a>)<br/></p>
<p></p> <p> </p><h3>This will be my second trip, and our fourth year working in Bolivia.</h3>
<p>Here is a breakdown of the expenses of the trip:</p>
<p>$ 1850  Lodging &amp; Program Costs (includes Materials)<br/>$ 1000 Flight <br/>$ 600  Food &amp; Local Travel <br/>$ 3450 Total

partnership with Teatro Trono, a well-respected performance troupe that 
has a deep history working in El Alto, will bring metal- and 
wood-working equipment, as well as a small-scale CNC router, to an arts 
organization that has the connections, expertise, and desire to bring 
these tools and the products they produce to the people of El Alto.<br/><br/><b>2.</b> <i><b>Park-in-a-Cart</b></i>
 _ In the summer of 2013, our team partnered with Teatro Trono to 
develop a mobile park platform (a deployable parkscape) for El Alto, a 
fringe settlement without public lands or the governing authority to 
create them. In the summer of 2014, we shall use the El Alto Maker Space
 to create several new iterations of Park-in-a-Cart. In the years that 
follow Teatro Trono will use the<br/>same space to create more profound versions of this work.<br/><br/>3. <i><b>Mobile Cantina and Culinary Institute</b></i>:
 The Mobile Cantina and Culinary Institute will use a van platform to 
celebrate native Bolivian agriculture and local methods of cooking 
through various pop-up educational initiatives, including free cooking 
workshops, community kitchens, and street-festivals. To realize this 
work, Teatro Trono and our team will partner with the non-profit arm of 
Gusto – a<br/>philanthropic initiative by internationally-recognized chef
 Claus Meyer. In the summer of 2014, We shall use the El Alto Maker 
Space to create the first version of this work; in the years that 
follow, our partners will use the same space to realize more advanced 
initiatives.<p>
</p><p>
</p><h3>Impact Beyond the Trip <br/>

</div><br/></div>","Hello lovelies!
As you may know, I have been working with the International Design 
Clinic since 2009 when they were based in Philadelphia, creating architectural urban interventions throughout
 the United States and in Bolivia. Our humanitarian design/build work 
has been recognized internationally including at the U.S. Pavilion at 
the 2012 Venice Biennale ""Spontaneous Interventions: Design Actions for 
the Common Good"" and currently on display at the Museum of Modern Art in
 New York City at the ""Uneven Growth"" exhibition. (http://uneven-growth.moma.org/post/100197648883...)
  This will be my second trip, and our fourth year working in Bolivia.
Here is a breakdown of the expenses of the trip:
$ 1850  Lodging & Program Costs (includes Materials)$ 1000 Flight $ 600  Food & Local Travel $ 3450 Total

  This will fund the advanced stages of a few unique projects! 1. The El Alto Makerspace, to be created in 
partnership with Teatro Trono, a well-respected performance troupe that 
has a deep history working in El Alto, will bring metal- and 
wood-working equipment, as well as a small-scale CNC router, to an arts 
organization that has the connections, expertise, and desire to bring 
these tools and the products they produce to the people of El Alto.2. Park-in-a-Cart
 _ In the summer of 2013, our team partnered with Teatro Trono to 
develop a mobile park platform (a deployable parkscape) for El Alto, a 
fringe settlement without public lands or the governing authority to 
create them. In the summer of 2014, we shall use the El Alto Maker Space
 to create several new iterations of Park-in-a-Cart. In the years that 
follow Teatro Trono will use thesame space to create more profound versions of this work.3. Mobile Cantina and Culinary Institute:
 The Mobile Cantina and Culinary Institute will use a van platform to 
celebrate native Bolivian agriculture and local methods of cooking 
through various pop-up educational initiatives, including free cooking 
workshops, community kitchens, and street-festivals. To realize this 
work, Teatro Trono and our team will partner with the non-profit arm of 
Gusto – aphilanthropic initiative by internationally-recognized chef
 Claus Meyer. In the summer of 2014, We shall use the El Alto Maker 
Space to create the first version of this work; in the years that 
follow, our partners will use the same space to realize more advanced 
initiatives.

Impact Beyond the Trip 
Undoubtedly, the most compelling part of the El Alto Makerspace is not 
the work we shall create in 2014 and 2015, but the work that our 
partners will create long after we have gone. Teatro Trono is an 
incredibly well-respected, creative, and talented organization, situated
 in the center of the fastest-growing fringe settlement in South 
America. They have, to date, designed and built three large centers for 
the arts in El Alto as well as various mobile arts education platforms 
in an around La Paz. Having a dedicated maker space, free and open to 
the public, will give them, and the residents they serve, the chance to 
experiment with new techniques of making, offer new programs, and 
collaboratively develop a fantasticplatform for creative exchange. 
The resulting work will confront the persistent cycle of dependent labor
 within El Alto – a cycle produced through lack of educational and 
creative opportunity

<p>We follow four characters - Moby, Jaden, Sarah, and Marie - who find themselves trying to correct a mistake which leaves the entire universe in turmoil. </p>
<p>The film starts with Jaden and Moby working together in an attempt to create a machine that will allow for long distance space travel. They abandon the project after they discover that the machine wields power much too dangerous to be meddled with. However, greed, jealousy, and depression drives one of them to do the unthinkable...</p>
<p>Carefully researched, the screenplay works hard to convey accurate scientific theories that will make you question what is reality once you leave the theater. It has been months in the making with many more still to come! Though a script has been finished and edited many times, it is still going through an advanced writing workshop to ensure that the story is told clearly and effectively. A couple professionals in the industry are even helping in the revision stage!</p>

<h4>Jacki Colombari - Producer</h4>
<div><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1250219/files/20150226001117-Jacki.jpg?1424938277"" src="""" style=""""/></p></div>
<div>A native of New Jersey, Jacki has found her niche in filmmaking as a producer. Working on MFA films and other projects all across Chicago, she as asserted herself as a go to person for putting together productions. This comes from her past experiences involving ballet and even being a registered travel agent. </div>
<div>An artist in every sense of the word, she not only makes films, but also dances and draws - being the principle artist for From Yesterday's storyboards. </div>
<div>When not creating, she finds herself enjoying the world. Able to speak Italian, she found herself living in that wonderful country for an extended period of time. That time helped her to focus in on what she wanted to become and that in turn has made her a valuable member of the Euterra Films and Media production team.</div>

<h3>The Actors</h3>
<h4>Corey Renfree - Jaden </h4>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1250247/files/20150226003430-Corey.jpg?1424939670"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/>Playing the part of Jaden is Corey Renfree. No stranger to acting, he has been performing on stage for over a decade, starting out in the Missoula Children's Theater.

<br/>
</div>
<p>Cast in the role of Sarah is Andrea Garneata. Hailing from Chicago, her and Director of Photography, Veronica, have a professional relationship that has spanned many years, making her an obvious choice to be a part of the production. Graduating high school early, Andrea is pursuing a career as a TV host. She has plenty of practice as she is also a YouTuber who has amassed over one hundred and fifty thousand views on her channel. </p>
<p>Her experience in acting spans across many short films done throughout the city of Chicago. The role of Sarah will be her second major role. Her first being ""the girlfriend"" in a Tribeca short film. </p>

<br/>
</div>
<div>The role of Moby belongs to John Bodnar. A National Merit Scholar, John comes from a similar situation as Andrea's in which he has been a part of many of Jace Kuntz's creative projects including music and photography. A veteran of the theater, John has excelled in the many roles he has been given throughout his lifetime. </div>
<div>A multi-instrumentalist, he is the drummer of Climax Community and has traveled across the country with Jace performing in places such as Indianapolis for the National FFA Talent Competition. Though unable to read sheet music, John has written and produced many original piano scores and is even helping some in the creation of the soundtrack for the feature. </div>

<h3>The Documentary</h3>
<div>As mentioned above, the feature isn't the only project that we are tackling this summer. Alongside the narrative, we will also be producing two full-length documentaries. One is a record of our journey from start to finish as we create this film in Montana. Think of it as an epic behind the scenes movie. Community involvement is important to us and we want to get you as close to the action as possible! While many of you can't make out to the production to see things first hand, we feel that a behind the scenes documentary will be the next best thing. </div>
<div>The other is something that is dear to all of our hearts. As the world continues to become more and more connected, we have reached an age where culture is becoming more and more obscure. The effects of this is very evident in the cultures of the Native Americans and the ranchers of Montana. </div>
<div>During filming of the feature and for months afterwards, we will be following family owned ranches, Native American gatherings, and Montana's very own Folk Festival so we can record how these cultures cope with the ever shrinking world and try to figure out what the future holds for traditions that have stood for hundreds of years. </div>
<div>We would like to express our gratitude to Heidi Hirschy, the Big Hole National Battlefield, and the Montana Folk Festival for allowing us to record their message. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<h3>Thank You</h3>
<div>There are not enough words to express how thankful we are of any and all support you can give us as we bring this story to life. This film is something that we as a production crew cannot wait to share with the public and for this reason, we want you to feel as much a part of this process as possible! </div>
<div>Even something as small as a share on your social media pages could mean all the difference in the world. </div>
<div>We will be regularly updating the campaign so you can track what progress is being made. Along with the perks for donations, we hope to make it unique and interesting so it can be our way of showing our appreciation for everything that you have done for us. </div>
<div>Again, thank you for everything and we can't wait to share all of this with you!</div>

</div></div>","The Story Set in the beautiful Dillon Valley, From Yesterday utilizes the gorgeous landscapes of Montana all around us to tell the story of time, love, and reality. For those who enjoy mind bending stories, this will certainly be worth the watch.

The film starts with Jaden and Moby working together in an attempt to create a machine that will allow for long distance space travel. They abandon the project after they discover that the machine wields power much too dangerous to be meddled with. However, greed, jealousy, and depression drives one of them to do the unthinkable...
Carefully researched, the screenplay works hard to convey accurate scientific theories that will make you question what is reality once you leave the theater. It has been months in the making with many more still to come! Though a script has been finished and edited many times, it is still going through an advanced writing workshop to ensure that the story is told clearly and effectively. A couple professionals in the industry are even helping in the revision stage!

Check out the OHRHC FB page here!Experience great music, fun times, and discover Hal's path through life that lead him to create a unique and magical venue for everyone to enjoy! PLUS you'll get to see Hal create fantastic hand-painted scarves in his secret workshop!

  

3. ELLSWORTH the life story of Canada's youngest cinema manager: Al Whittle of Wolfville, NS. Originally from New Brunswick, Al started working in the movie business in his late teens. Beginning in Amherst, NS, he quickly rose in the ranks to become Canada's youngest theatre manager!

     
Al settled in Wolfville where he managed the Acadia Cinema until his retirement in 2000. Not only was he the cinema manager, he was a man everyone recognised and knew for his warm-hearted greetings and open acceptance of every person who went to the movies. And he worked at Acadia University during the day so all the students knew him by name!

What will they look like?
Both films are being shot in HD for maximum picture quality. They will be easily screened in a digital cinema or scaled all the way down to an iPad. 
Principle photography will begin in August 2015 and will continue intil 
the middle to end of October 2015. Post-production will follow with all 
three films edited and mixed by August 2016.

Currently Untitled will feature direct cinema as the process of Wayne & Geoff creating their collaboration and executing their plan will be shown as it actually unfolds mixed with interviews from five women who know them well. to tie it all together Dave Whitney will guide us through the ins and outs of this unique friendship!
Owl's Head Road House Concerts will feature live performances, interviews with past and present artists who have attended Owl's Road concerts, and an in-depth look at the life journey of founder Harold McGee. Hal will guide us through the process of setting the stage for so many talented artists while at the same time exploring a rich and full life of a very tall man and a master of scarf painting!
ELLSWORTH will have interviews conducted of people close to Al as well as dramatisations on the five most important moments in his life. These dramatisations will be in a live theatre format with each segment at about 5-8 minutes, spread throughout the film. Each segment will feature a different director (TBA) and reflect a specific time period in Al's life.

What Else Can I do?
As we approach summer, we will be casting for parts in the five dramatic segments for ELLSWORTH! We are looking for talented screen and stage actors in the Wolfville and surrounding area. We'll also be hiring small crews starting in August so keep checking here and on the official website!


What will happen when the films are finished?
Once the films are complete, we will submit them to documentary film festivals around the world. We are currently pursuing a broadcasters agreement so that we can also put them on television! They will be available to rent or watch online after their runs on the festival circuit and television circuit.

Check out one of the perks: The ELLSWORTH mug!

wakes to find his voice gone — an event that sends him over the edge, 
plunging into a catastrophic breakdown. Stranded and distressed<span style=""background-color: initial;"">, he is haunted by the memory of his

</div></div>","KEN - THE MOVIE  is a new film project by award-winning writer-director Claudia Rorarius. The musician Ken Stringfellow (The Posies, R.E.M., Big Star) will play the lead character in his first ever acting role. After an intense process of research and development, the main cast is assembled, the story has come together, and we are ready to go! Shooting is scheduled in the US for autumn 2016 and spring 2017 — dates that can’t come soon enough.KEN - THE MOVIE grew from Claudia Rorarius' desire to work with a 
particular person — Ken 
Stringfellow. And yes, the real life Ken and the film’s 
protagonist share the same name, but this is no documentary. 
Rather, Ken Stringfellow acts as himself, reliving parts of his life and fraying the line between reality and fiction in the process.The story follows Ken on a tour through the US. It’s a road he’s 
travelled a thousand times before, but on this occasion his world is 
turned upside-down. The towns appear deserted, his shows 
are going badly, and his nerves are at breaking point. One morning he 
wakes to find his voice gone — an event that sends him over the edge, 
plunging into a catastrophic breakdown. Stranded and distressed, he is haunted by the memory of his 
bodily mother abandoning him as a child. After deciding he's had enough emotional torment, he takes fate into his own hands and begins the search for his lost mother, taking a long and painful road back to 
life.






KEN - THE MOVIE will deploy the same experimental techniques of Claudia’s previous films. As events from Ken's real life intertwine with fictional elements, the genres of documentary and fiction fade away in the revelation of an intimate new form of cinema.
The innovate potential of this movie, though, cannot be realised without your support. Everything depends on this first stage. If we reach our initial targets and everything goes well, we will extend the campaign. The momentum and support of this first phase will also impact our ability to secure public funding.






KEN - THE MOVIE brings together a team of award-winning filmmakers, musicians, cinematographers, and actors. 

Claudia Rorarius' last film, Chi l'ha Visto - Who Saw Him, was nominated for Best Performance, Best Director, and Best Movie at the Torino Film Festival in 2009. It was also selected for many more festivals, such as the Karlovy Vary International Film Festival, the Montréal World Film Festival, and Film Festival Max Ophüls. Critics have called it ""intensive"", ""touching"", and ""grand cinema"". Her work grapples with how we understand ourselves, illuminating dark corners of identity and despair while raising questions for the nature of filmmaking itself. 
























Ken Stringfellow's life is music. A founding member of the legendary Seattle indie-pop band The Posies, Ken also played a part in the reformation of Big Star, one of the most influential bands in pop history. He has also toured with R.E.M. for 10 years, assisted with their albums “Reveal” and “Around the Sun,” and in 2005 he founded the garage rock band The Disciplines. More recently Ken has worked as a songwriter and producer for acts like Lagwagon, Damien Jurado, The Long Winters, Snow Patrol, Neil Young, Patti Smith, Mudhoney, and Death Cab For Cutie. To date, his discography spans over 200 albums. A recent solo record, 2012’s Danzig in the Moonlight, was warmly received by critics.



Although Ken was featured in Big Star: Nothing Can Hurt Me, a documentary about the infamous power-pop band, KEN - THE MOVIE will be his first acting role. In the film, you can expect to see Ken do what he does best: captivate us with his heartfelt songs. But the film also shows what lies on the other side of those songs, probing into his life and bringing his fears and vulnerabilities to the surface.




Intense, uncompromising, and challenging, our film isn't the kind of thing that investors flock to. But honestly, we wouldn't have it any other way. So, out on our own, trying to do something different, we are looking for your support.  

Supporting this project has a special benefit: with this commitment 
you will help to recognize, develop, and actively promote the unique vision of women in the film industry. By getting KEN - THE MOVIE finished, we hope to inspire many more female directors to pick up a camera and get out there. 


Throughout her career, Claudia has battled her way through the gender bias of the film business. As a member of Pro Quote Regie, the biggest women's director movement in Germany, she plays an active role in the promotion of women in film. Jane Campion gets to the heart of the issue, saying, ""Without [women] writing and being directors, the rest of us are not going to know the whole story.""










Filmmaking is a collaborative process. We're 
working hard to create the 
best work in the most economical fashion. All donations will go straight into the various costs 
associated with the making and airing of KEN - THE MOVIE. 
These include equipment rentals, travel and transportation, and general production costs. Here's
a diagram of what we need for the film:












Firstly, perks. We have an amazing range of special offers for you to choose from. Ken Stringfellow has cleared the path to his back-catalogue where you can choose your favorite album, which he will sign with a personalized message! Claudia Rorarius has put her experience as a photographer and director on the table, offering you a chance to meet and discuss whatever is on your mind. 
And, if you're a true lifetime Ken Stringfellow fan, he's even agreed to perform private concerts for you and your friends. Of course, there's many things in-between, ranging from an advanced copy of the film to a personalized music video. Check the righthand side of the page for a full list of the exciting perks!
With your support, we'll be spending the upcoming months making the movie. While the film is in development, Claudia and Ken will be keeping you up to date on their progress through Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and their website. 

We're excited for you, our precious friends and fans, to be a part of it all.

Hello Global Community :)<br/><br/>
</h1> <h4>My name is Gio Miranda Coelho Junior, and I am the Executive  Director for Neo Evolutionary Logic Project (NEVLO Project). </h4>
<p><br/>Since 2013, I have been steadily building on ideas whose goal is to provide a free classroom with a team of professionals on all subjects sustainable. Whether it's is building your home, growing and cooking your own food, making your own clothes, or trying to stretch your body and expand your intelligence, these are all concepts that can be attained sustainably for a more permanent culture that serves us, our children and their children's children. <br/></p>
<p>In order to do this, I combined multiple industries such as art, psychology and kinesthetic learning and formed ""<b>Armone Galaxy</b>"",
 a revolutionary life-sized human board game. This concept has taken me 
11 years to forge, and with the love and support of so many all over the
 world, I am finally bringing it to reality. I believe this board game 
will help humanity and provide them with powerful tools that promote 
balance, intelligence, and social alliances.<br/><br/><b>So what is Armone Galaxy? </b>In 2013, we raised the funds to construct a 36-foot geodesic dome. This year we will commence phase II and construct a 5-circuit labyrinth around the dome. [SEE IMAGE ABOVE]<br/></p>

<p>I decided to put the STB movie project aside to make my next motion picture, <i>Montauk Chronicles</i>. I promised myself that I would return to <i>South Texas Blues</i> when the time was right. <br/></p>
<p></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1439873850/xpyqr2j3c1zqjqobgfyt.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/> </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>Making Montauk Chronicles was an odyssey not unlike the one that ""TOBE"" experiences in South Texas Blues.</b><br/></p>
<p>I pushed myself further and harder than I ever had in my life and it was the greatest challenge that I've experienced to this date.</p>
<p>As soon as I completed post-production on<i> Montauk Chronicles</i>, I immediately realized it was time to make South Texas Blues. I knew I was ready. <br/><br/></p>

<p>I sharpened my skills to a razor edge as <b>I personally handled most major tasks (Including writing, producing, directing, cinematography, visual effects and editing) in the creation of the entire feature-length movie.</b></p>

Making Montauk Chronicles I learned to be efficient, economical and extremely creative with very little.</div><div>
<b>No dollar will be wasted</b> (making South Texas Blues) as I have plans for very specifically scheduled Pre-Production and Production working days where no one will be on set that isn't involved in something significant.</div><div>My personal philosophy on movie making is that it's an illusion. <b>So to create an illusion it requires more ingenuity and experience than money. </b><br/>The show is meant to be on the screen, and NOT on the set.<br/><b> If you're a good illusionist you can make gold from dust.</b><br/>
</div><div>I often wondered why on larger shoots that I've witnessed, the production management felt it necessary to hire more people than they need and rent/buy more equipment than was ever needed. I've also noticed a waste of money on transportation, food, lodging etc.</div><div> <span style=""background-color: initial;"">If we're shooting a scene that requires five people on set, then five people will be on set.  If one person is needed to shoot an insert-shot than that's who will be working that day.</span>
</div><div>This method of thinking was how I was able to keep the budget below $30,000 for Montauk Chronicles and save a great deal of time.<br/>
</div><div>We will be living in Austin, Texas, for the duration of the production, and a large portion of our cast and crew will be hired locally i.e. saving money on transportation and lodging. <b>We're also looking for eager interns and faithful devotees for days where we need a little extra help.</b><br/>
</div><div>I'm confident that the $80,000 that we're seeking on INDIEGOGO, will bring us to a very significant place in our journey and most likely well in to post production. <br/>I'm personally going to handle the remaining financing.</div><div>
<b>We're currently securing a dedicated group of artists who, over the years, have expressed their adamant interest in being part of South Texas Blues.</b> Our cast and crew are more interested in creating a solid motion picture than receiving a big paycheck.<br/>
</div><div>The money that we're raising on INDIEGOGO will be a significant portion of our general budget.</div><div>We're going to get to work right away, and our first location scouts in Austin, Texas are set for October 2015. October 2015 also marks the very first of our behind the scenes communication with our ""Micro-Producers.""<br/>
</div><div>To remain economical, several members of our production crew are wearing multiple hats.<b> Your contributions are in great hands. Everyone involved has experience and are all integral contributors of successfully completed and distributed motion pictures.</b><span style=""background-color: initial;""><br/></span>
</div><div>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">Below is a general breakdown of our budget and please understand, through our previous experience, we know how to use the money wisely.<br/><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1440050506/qo7xwe5i1n3ynl1qijdm.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h4>
<b style=""background-color: initial;"">South Texas Blues is larger in scale, than Montauk Chronicles so we're going to need a bit more to accomplish our goal but we can still keep the budget considerably low using the same production ethics.<br/><br/>1. Pre-Production:</b><span style=""background-color: initial;"">  </span><b style=""background-color: initial;"">(Between October 2015-February 2016)</b>
</h4></span><h4><b>Estimated budget $35,000</b></h4>
</div><div><span style=""background-color: initial;"">We plan to begin principal photography on South Texas Blues in late March of 2016.  Before we begin shooting we must first spend several solid months of careful pre-production and planning.</span></div><div>
<b style=""background-color: initial;"">Pre Production Includes but is not limited to:</b><br/>
</div><div> Location scouting &amp; securing locations, travel, production design, visual and make-up effects design and testing, casting and rehearsal, costumes, securing equipment and props, storyboards, hiring and securing the remainder of our crew and organizing all other logistics regarding the forthcoming production of South Texas Blues. </div><div>In addition, during several of our location visits, we will save a great deal of time by shooting exterior establishing shots, sunsets, Astro-time-lapse photography, environments, and landscapes that are all unique to Texas. I find that this is a job that requires no more than a crew of two people, and this footage can come in very useful later in the editing.<br/><br/><h4>
<b>2.</b> <b>Production (Between March and May of 2016)</b>
</h4>
<h4><b>Estimated Budget $40 -$60,000</b></h4>
<br/>We are designing our production schedule to create breathing room in between our shoots. There far too many productions that fail because the attempt to cram all of their shooting days into a short period of time (typically 25 - 40 days maximum)<br/> In those cases the cast and crew are exhausted by the second week, and much of the original vision is lost.</div><div> Our shooting schedule will last, on and off, from March to the end of May. <br/>This will allow us to shoot a good deal of our exteriors first (to beat the forthcoming Texas heat) and will give us space, in between shoots, for the cast and crew to rest and for us to assemble and test our footage to better prepare for post production.<br/>There is a good deal of practical special effects in South Texas Blues, and those days will be scheduled two separate blocks of shooting.  The effects team and production design team will be on set for most of those days, however there are other days where we will only need a minimal amount of crew.</div><div>If there's a scene where two characters are having a conversation in a country field it is not important to have a large crew of artisans on set. It can all be accomplished with a smaller crew.</div><div>We're also designing many of our shooting blocks so that particular actors can complete their parts, in a chronological sequence, and we don't waste any time.</div><div>It's this sensibility when applied to our scheduling that will save a great deal of money, time and energy.</div><div>Many of our shooting locations will be on-location in areas in and  around Austin, Texas.<br/><br/><b>Production includes but is not limited to:</b><br/> general production insurance, equipment rentals, set construction, live practical make-up effects and key make-up departments,sound mixing and recording crew, catering for all cast and crew, stunts and coordination, lodging and transportation for particular cast and crew members, a general budget (payment) for all cast and crew for the duration of their (Production) working days, equipment transportation and storage for exterior location shoots, and all additional technical and logistical aspects of our production.<br/><br/><h4>Post Production:<br/>Estimated budget $15 - $20,000<br/><br/><span style=""font-weight: normal;""> Many of our scenes will be assembled during our shoot. I applied this method during the making of Montauk Chronicles and it proved not only to be a wonderful time saver but also it allowed me to see if I needed any additional coverage during the production. These editing assemble days will take place on our scheduled ""rest-days"" for the crew.</span>
</h4>
<h4>
<span style=""font-weight: normal;"">I and one editing lab assistant will work through each scene to make sure we have exactly what we need to make a great movie in post production.</span><br/><br/><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">When we finally enter the official post production arena we will already have saved valuable amount of time and money.</span><br/><br/>Post Production will include but is not limited to:<br/><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Post visual effects, color correction and grading, sound design, editing and mixing, and general motion picture editing. </span><br/>

<br/> <p><b> It's my humble opinion that It's important for a director to be the most experienced person on set.</b> It's not important to be the master of all tasks but a good director must know the general language of all movie making tasks so he or she can communicate well with the cast and crew.</p>
<p>Movie making is in large part problem solving.</p>
<p><b>There are challenges making every motion picture, but with my current experience and our solid crew I'm more than confident that we will reach all goals. </b></p>
<p>Making Montauk Chronicles was a series of great challenges but that's movie making and it's to be expected. I suspect it's inexperience (in all areas of movie making) that leads to most problems on a movie set.
</p>
<p>The best way to reduce ricks and challenges on a film set, is to be prepared and hire a crew and cast that know what they're getting into. <br/></p>
<p>We're prepared for the long hours and for the hard work. We're prepared to use the budget wisely and you (Our Contributors) will pay witness to the entire process through our virtual observation window.

Hello Folks,

My name is Christopher Garetano and I want to cordially invite you to be part of a unique motion picture experience called South Texas Blues.

I'm primarily a movie maker, and I recently completed my second picture, Montauk Chronicles. (See the trailer and additional information, at the links below)
MONTAUK CHRONICLES : MOVIE TRAILER
MONTAUK CHRONICLES: OFFICIAL WEBSITE
I'm here today to tell you all about a project that is so close to my heart, it haunts me. 
It's as if the very project itself calls to me. It's a powerful entity. It's been in my mind for twenty-years and in-development for almost ten years. I feel its energy often, like a large magnet drawing me in.
 I cannot resist any longer.
South Texas Blues is one part fantasy, one part history and one part insanity.
It's the kaleidoscopic story of ""TOBE"",  an independent film director who battles environmental elements, time, and his own demons during the mysterious summer of 1973.
 It takes place during the creation one of the most infamous horror movies in history, ""Saturn In Retrograde"" (which ultimately became The Texas Chain Saw Massacre) and ""Tobe"" has no idea of what he's about to unleash into the world.
Tobe and the crew of ""Saturn In Retrograde"" must climb great and dangerous heights to complete the movie.  The Texas heat, sleep deprivation, lack of money, the ticking clock and each other are only the small obstacles in their way.


[Have a look at an early SOUTH TEXAS BLUES ""Pitch-Film"" (below) that was used to court potential investors from 2006 - 2012.]

In 2012, after many ups and downs regarding funding, I (along with Illustrator Trevor Cook) carefully translated my original screenplay into the graphic novel form. Trevor did a wonderful job of translating my vision to the comic book form.
  The South Texas Blues: Graphic Novel was published, and serialized, in Fangoria Magazine throughout 2012.SOUTH TEXAS BLUES : NEWS POST # 1
SOUTH TEXAS BLUES : NEWS POST #2



I decided to put the STB movie project aside to make my next motion picture, Montauk Chronicles. I promised myself that I would return to South Texas Blues when the time was right. 

 

Making Montauk Chronicles was an odyssey not unlike the one that ""TOBE"" experiences in South Texas Blues.
I pushed myself further and harder than I ever had in my life and it was the greatest challenge that I've experienced to this date.
As soon as I completed post-production on Montauk Chronicles, I immediately realized it was time to make South Texas Blues. I knew I was ready. 



I sharpened my skills to a razor edge as I personally handled most major tasks (Including writing, producing, directing, cinematography, visual effects and editing) in the creation of the entire feature-length movie.
I had to learn to be economical, think quickly and work with a small cast and crew.
The entire budget was far under $30,000. 
Montauk Chronicles is now a success and it's currently reaching a growing world-wide audience.INTERVIEW WITH CHRISTOPHER ON AOL NEWSINTERVIEW WITH CHRISTOPHER ON COAST TO COAST AM





 During the making of Montauk Chronicles. I certainly learned how to handle the logistics, people, and technical aspects of a large, complicated movie project but I also learned what ""TOBE"" was going through while making ""Saturn In Retrograde.""

I understand his odyssey at a molecular level and I'm ready to go to war.

I'd like to recruit YOU to be part of this very special ""platoon"" and I'm going to make this wild and beautiful ride one you will never forget.


We invite you to be a ""micro-producer"" for White Phosphorus Pictures. Your contribution (of $25 dollars or more) will allow you full access to the South Texas Blues screenplay as well as a constant window into our production (via-a special VIMEO link) where you will view the making of from the beginning to the very end of post-production.Even the smallest (Ten-dollar) donation will allow you access to the screenplay but we designed a variety of more amazing gifts for higher investing ""micro-producers.""

Every week, from pre-production on to the completion of South Texas Blues you will have access to a behind the scenes window through a chronological series of short documentaries and vignettes.








Making Montauk Chronicles I learned to be efficient, economical and extremely creative with very little.
No dollar will be wasted (making South Texas Blues) as I have plans for very specifically scheduled Pre-Production and Production working days where no one will be on set that isn't involved in something significant.My personal philosophy on movie making is that it's an illusion. So to create an illusion it requires more ingenuity and experience than money. The show is meant to be on the screen, and NOT on the set. If you're a good illusionist you can make gold from dust.
I often wondered why on larger shoots that I've witnessed, the production management felt it necessary to hire more people than they need and rent/buy more equipment than was ever needed. I've also noticed a waste of money on transportation, food, lodging etc. If we're shooting a scene that requires five people on set, then five people will be on set.  If one person is needed to shoot an insert-shot than that's who will be working that day.
This method of thinking was how I was able to keep the budget below $30,000 for Montauk Chronicles and save a great deal of time.
We will be living in Austin, Texas, for the duration of the production, and a large portion of our cast and crew will be hired locally i.e. saving money on transportation and lodging. We're also looking for eager interns and faithful devotees for days where we need a little extra help.
I'm confident that the $80,000 that we're seeking on INDIEGOGO, will bring us to a very significant place in our journey and most likely well in to post production. I'm personally going to handle the remaining financing.
We're currently securing a dedicated group of artists who, over the years, have expressed their adamant interest in being part of South Texas Blues. Our cast and crew are more interested in creating a solid motion picture than receiving a big paycheck.
The money that we're raising on INDIEGOGO will be a significant portion of our general budget.We're going to get to work right away, and our first location scouts in Austin, Texas are set for October 2015. October 2015 also marks the very first of our behind the scenes communication with our ""Micro-Producers.""
To remain economical, several members of our production crew are wearing multiple hats. Your contributions are in great hands. Everyone involved has experience and are all integral contributors of successfully completed and distributed motion pictures.

Below is a general breakdown of our budget and please understand, through our previous experience, we know how to use the money wisely.

South Texas Blues is larger in scale, than Montauk Chronicles so we're going to need a bit more to accomplish our goal but we can still keep the budget considerably low using the same production ethics.1. Pre-Production:  (Between October 2015-February 2016)
Estimated budget $35,000
We plan to begin principal photography on South Texas Blues in late March of 2016.  Before we begin shooting we must first spend several solid months of careful pre-production and planning.
Pre Production Includes but is not limited to:
 Location scouting & securing locations, travel, production design, visual and make-up effects design and testing, casting and rehearsal, costumes, securing equipment and props, storyboards, hiring and securing the remainder of our crew and organizing all other logistics regarding the forthcoming production of South Texas Blues. In addition, during several of our location visits, we will save a great deal of time by shooting exterior establishing shots, sunsets, Astro-time-lapse photography, environments, and landscapes that are all unique to Texas. I find that this is a job that requires no more than a crew of two people, and this footage can come in very useful later in the editing.
2. Production (Between March and May of 2016)

Estimated Budget $40 -$60,000
We are designing our production schedule to create breathing room in between our shoots. There far too many productions that fail because the attempt to cram all of their shooting days into a short period of time (typically 25 - 40 days maximum) In those cases the cast and crew are exhausted by the second week, and much of the original vision is lost. Our shooting schedule will last, on and off, from March to the end of May. This will allow us to shoot a good deal of our exteriors first (to beat the forthcoming Texas heat) and will give us space, in between shoots, for the cast and crew to rest and for us to assemble and test our footage to better prepare for post production.There is a good deal of practical special effects in South Texas Blues, and those days will be scheduled two separate blocks of shooting.  The effects team and production design team will be on set for most of those days, however there are other days where we will only need a minimal amount of crew.If there's a scene where two characters are having a conversation in a country field it is not important to have a large crew of artisans on set. It can all be accomplished with a smaller crew.We're also designing many of our shooting blocks so that particular actors can complete their parts, in a chronological sequence, and we don't waste any time.It's this sensibility when applied to our scheduling that will save a great deal of money, time and energy.Many of our shooting locations will be on-location in areas in and  around Austin, Texas.Production includes but is not limited to: general production insurance, equipment rentals, set construction, live practical make-up effects and key make-up departments,sound mixing and recording crew, catering for all cast and crew, stunts and coordination, lodging and transportation for particular cast and crew members, a general budget (payment) for all cast and crew for the duration of their (Production) working days, equipment transportation and storage for exterior location shoots, and all additional technical and logistical aspects of our production.Post Production:Estimated budget $15 - $20,000 Many of our scenes will be assembled during our shoot. I applied this method during the making of Montauk Chronicles and it proved not only to be a wonderful time saver but also it allowed me to see if I needed any additional coverage during the production. These editing assemble days will take place on our scheduled ""rest-days"" for the crew.


I and one editing lab assistant will work through each scene to make sure we have exactly what we need to make a great movie in post production.When we finally enter the official post production arena we will already have saved valuable amount of time and money.Post Production will include but is not limited to:Post visual effects, color correction and grading, sound design, editing and mixing, and general motion picture editing. 


All of our sequences involving practical make-up effects and post visual effects, have already been extensively planned and storyboarded by Christopher Garetano and artist Trevor Cook.
  



South Texas Blues is  a movie about personal challenge and triumph in the face of great obstacles.

This project has been in my life for two decades and I could have began a crowd-source fund for it, years ago. 
I'm convinced that moviegoers want something different and exciting. They want something inspiring and to be involved in something like this project that can bring a great energy into their lives and into the world. It's the only way to make this picture. 
This story is about a man who wasn't yet a Hollywood director. He had a powerful dream and had to fight for it every step of the way. It was his faithful and talented cast and crew that helped him to ultimately create the masterpiece that it became. That is the soul of my picture.
As for the gift that I would like to share with the contributor, I sincerely want you to feel your integral part in this journey. You will receive a digital copy of the screenplay only days after your donation. Please consider yourself our official ""micro-producer "" and feel free to tell everyone that you are.


Consider yourself an important part of this project . I hold you in the highest regard and that's why I'm allowing you a direct window into our entire process from beginning to end. I want you to see every step of the creation process and when it's finally completed you will know, in your heart, that we all accomplished something together.
   

  It's my humble opinion that It's important for a director to be the most experienced person on set. It's not important to be the master of all tasks but a good director must know the general language of all movie making tasks so he or she can communicate well with the cast and crew.
Movie making is in large part problem solving.
There are challenges making every motion picture, but with my current experience and our solid crew I'm more than confident that we will reach all goals. 
Making Montauk Chronicles was a series of great challenges but that's movie making and it's to be expected. I suspect it's inexperience (in all areas of movie making) that leads to most problems on a movie set.

The best way to reduce ricks and challenges on a film set, is to be prepared and hire a crew and cast that know what they're getting into. 
We're prepared for the long hours and for the hard work. We're prepared to use the budget wisely and you (Our Contributors) will pay witness to the entire process through our virtual observation window. The production methods learned making my previous movie will be applied once again. We understand the difference between a movie set and a party and everyone on the set of South Texas Blues will be there to work hard and make a great movie.





We have many options and perks for those who want to contribute to this project. Even if you can't give a financial contribution for South Texas Blues, we would love it if you would spread the word to people you know who might. Enthusiasm and getting the word out is equally important.
Spread the word about our Indiegogo campaign on Facebook, Twitter, movie sites, and anywhere else you can think of!
If you live in the Austin area (or elsewhere if you're willing to travel) contact us and let us know how you might be able to contribute. We would love to hear from you! Email us directly at southtexasblues@hotmail.com.

Harry just wants reconciliation with his ex, he wants to spend more time with his son, he wants to have a better relationship with his son's step dad the ""I told you so"" doomsday prepper, he wants some kind of normal life, but he's not going to get it - not just yet.</p>

<p><span style=""font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 30px;"">How You Can Make This Happen.</span><br/></p>
</div><div>
<p>Now, obviously we are starting from the beginning of the process for this film. <a href=""https://youtu.be/rSSEGlSccGg"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">""After The Blast""</a> had the benefit of being mostly completed before its fundraising campaign began. So we will be raising more funds this time to facilitate the complete process, and also we will once again utilize the production techniques that we have developed at Crows Nest to deliver high quality without high cost.</p>
<p>""After The Blast 2: After After The Blast: The Gridiron Wasteland"" will make extensive use of practical <a href=""https://youtu.be/BBzAtliXQoY"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">miniature sets</a> and vehicles and buildings, giving it its signature retro feel. In addition to the hard models and props and costumes already in hand, we will be adding Element 3D to our editing facilities. This software will allow us to custom-create scenes of massive armies clashing with total realism and extremely low cost when compared to a Hollywood blockbuster equivalent. </p>
<h3>How Really Good Can Become Great:</h3>
<p>We have come up with a budget that guarantees completion but also allows for goals beyond the minimum we require to deliver a picture. </p>
<p></p>
<p>We made <a href=""https://youtu.be/rSSEGlSccGg"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">""After The Blast""</a> for under $5,000 so as long as we can raise that minimum we will be able to deliver at the very least the level of quality we have in the past.</p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Raising more funds will make it possible to incrementally add value</span> <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">to the project, both in terms of practical expenses (more special effects/production design) and time (more money means a less strenuous shoot schedule. That means fewer problems to solve in post-production, and that </span>saves time<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> and increases value</span>.<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> </span></p>
<p>We don't want to put a limit on what we can raise, because we fully intend to develop the <a href=""https://youtu.be/rSSEGlSccGg"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">""After The Blast""</a> property to its maximum potential and want to continually improve our product and most importantly, keep making more.</p>
<p>Starting with a $5,000 base budget, we will add value as we gain more funds.</p>
<p>For example, at a certain level of funding we will add a camera <a href=""https://youtu.be/m2ThTb6iffA"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">drone</a> which will allow us to orchestrate magnificent vistas of the Wasteland and create a feeling of space and loneliness unachievable in any other way. </p>
<p>This time around we will be shooting outdoors in addition to the library location we have secured. The desert environs outside of L.A. will provide nature's contribution to our production value.</p>
<p>So, this is the framework we are thinking of for a scaled budget: </p>$5,000- Basic Budget - low shoot days, equipment, props amortized, salaries deferred</div><div>$8,000 - Budget Plus - We will add the camera drone and more shoot days/locations.</div><div>$15,000 - ""Full"" Budget - This fulfills the budget breakdown (cost estimations) as written.</div><div>$15,000 and above - We will add line items to the budget incrementally ""as needed"" to increase the film's value, for example:</div><div><ul>
<li>More shoot days, more locations<br/>
</li>
<li>Editor - I cut the 1st <a href=""https://youtu.be/rSSEGlSccGg"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">""After The Blast""</a> but will gladly relinquish the editor's chair.<br/>
</li>
<li>Stage Rental<br/>
</li>
<li>Bigger crew (bigger crew means less multitasking, more efficient production)<br/>
</li>
<li>Better Craft Services and Meals<br/>
</li>
<li>""Name"" Guest Star Actor<br/>
</li>
<li>""Hit"" song<br/>
</li>
<li>""Name"" composer to score the film<br/>
</li>
<li>Larger epic scenes using many actor ""extras"" in conjunction with computer generated images<br/>
</li>
<li>More money for promotion, promotional items, promotional events, P.R., Social Media Optimization<br/>
</li>
<li>Upgraded Website<br/>
</li>
<li>More money for festival entry<br/>
</li>
<li>More money for distribution to online platforms for sales.<br/>
</li>
</ul></div><div>All of these goals are clearly aimed at publicizing our efforts and monetizing the <a href=""https://youtu.be/rSSEGlSccGg"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">""After The Blast""</a> brand and maintaining it as a going concern.</div><div><br/></div> <div> <h3>The Perks.</h3>
<div>Our perks are immersive and fun. Part of the joy of creating a ""universe"" like this is being able to extend the experience beyond the movie. By contributing, you are joining us in creating and perpetuating this.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<h3>The Impact.</h3>
<h3><span style=""font-size: 16px; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 26px;""><p>The first <a href=""https://youtu.be/rSSEGlSccGg"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">""After The Blast""</a> short grew out of a workshop that I organized, and we tried to emulate a number of my favorite directors' styles, like Paul Greengrass, Francis Coppola, Stanley Kubrick, Robert Altman, Tony Scott, the writing style of Bill Forsythe. I felt we were successful in that, and so we will continue that tradition into the second film. George Miller, that's a no-brainer. This movie has a heavy element of ""Mad Max"" - the original story was predominantly parody of the original Mad Max movies. What timing. David Lean, Werner Herzog - oh yes, we will be going out of doors to shoot this one, to exotic deserts like the Owens Valley or Mojave. Oh, and then there is football, so get out your ""Rollerball"", your ""Varsity Blues"" - dare I say there will be shades of <a href=""https://youtu.be/7qgqeISKWko"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Steve Sabol</a> here? Hmmm…. And there is a core section involving the siege of a public library that may remind you of John Carpenter's <a href=""https://youtu.be/seJIOcQWMwc"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">""Assault on Precinct 13""</a>, which by the way has some very funny moments. More proof you can make something funny in the middle of catastrophe.</p></span></h3>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">And ""After The Blast 2: After After The Blast: The Gridiron Wasteland"" is a cliffhanger, leading straight into the third chapter and the revelation of the secret of our Wasteland!</span><br/></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">You can be a part of this. You can in fact be the force that makes this adventure not only possible, but wildly successful.  We are paving the way for more and bigger adventures and new films. </span></p> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<div>
<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Though grand in scale and location, the core scenes will center around set pieces and most importantly, the characters. Reference </span><a href=""https://youtu.be/seJIOcQWMwc"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">""Assault on Precinct 13""</a><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> (the 1976 John Carpenter film, not, I repeat, not the remake) and you can see how a little crafty filmmaking on a low budget can stretch ""four people in a room talking"" into ""four people in a room under siege by a nameless horde"".</span><br/>
</div>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">And remember, this is a short film, which lightens the load somewhat when it comes to the number of rabbits we are going to be pulling out of our hats when it comes to our visual trickery.  And, w</span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">e are at a kind of magical moment in time, where easily accessible technology makes great leaps possible by providing the small-scale filmmaker with the tools of a master.</span></p>
<p>Clearly, this is a particular style of cinema. But for us, ""low budget"" does not mean low quality. It means I am writing the script with built-in ""Crows Nest Customization"", carefully crafting it to tell a grand story without having to hurdle obstacles of money and time by knowing inside and out our capabilities as a filmmaking group. It means actor/producer Mark Taormino (who is also one of the stars of <a href=""https://youtu.be/rSSEGlSccGg"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">""After The Blast""</a>) will provide his complete and wholly owned camera equipment package free of charge. It means Crows Nest Vertical Pictures has its own prop and costume collection, with an emphasis on sci-fi/military. It means there are vastly talented people willing to take a chance on the success of a project they can directly affect for the better.  And it means we live and produce in Los Angeles, the greatest source of talented, trained, educated, dedicated and experienced film artists, technicians and actors in the history of the world.</p>
<p>Most importantly, we shoot well-crafted scripts that tell compelling stories that despite the over-the-top subject and style are always about the landscape of the human soul, the human experience, where we've been and where we're going. The short film I co-produced with Mark Taormino, director Alan Chamberlain's  <a href=""https://www.indiegogo.com/campaigns/after-after-the-blast-the-gridiron-wasteland/edit/www.judgesshort.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><a href=""http://www.judgesshort.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">""Judges""</a>, is a great example of that dramatic exploration. It also shows clearly our level of capability in terms of quality and visual style. This project was done with the same ways and means as <a href=""https://youtu.be/rSSEGlSccGg"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">""After The Blast""</a>, but without the benefit of a fundraising campaign. I think the results are spectacular.</p>
<p>And we are blessed to have such great talent eager to help us fulfill our visions and achieve our overarching mission: to present movie-watching experiences as fun and fulfilling as any other.</p>
<p>So the question is not so much ""Can we do it?"" because we've done it, going on twice now. The question is, ""How far can we take this?""</p>
<p>And the answer is in your hands.</p>
<p></p>
<p>You have the power to make it all happen, and to be along for the ride. You can be the wind in our sails as we continue to develop <a href=""https://youtu.be/rSSEGlSccGg"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">""After The Blast""</a> as a going concern.</p>
<p>We will be here, keeping you updated on all things ""After After The Blast"" and taking you to the Wasteland - and beyond….</p>
<p>Thank you!</p> </div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p>We know some of you may want to support this project but just can't contribute. If you have a special skill, a special prop or costume, or even know of a location or other asset that would enhance our story, please feel free to contact us here. (I know for a fact we're going to be on the hunt for some football equipment.)</p>
<p>Also, making some noise about our campaign can be equally helpful. (Indiegogo has great share tools that make it easy to get the word out.) Folks might find what we are doing as filmmakers and how we are approaching the process to be an interesting story to follow. As the campaign progresses, we hope to provide entertaining updates so it will be fun to check back in.</p>
<p>And more than anything, to quote the great (if fictional) Steve Zissou:</p>

</div></div>","Welcome to our Wasteland! 

Hi, everyone, Sam here, director of ""After The Blast"", at the Crows Nest studio, headquarters for all things ""After The Blast"", announcing the launch of a new ""After The Blast"" Adventure: 
""After The Blast 2: After After The Blast - The Gridiron Wasteland""!
We are going to see some spectacle, because this is the centerpiece of a trilogy of short films that will ultimately tell a complete story and reveal the secret of our Wasteland.
The post-apocalyptic wasteland of total destruction is even funnier this time. 
In the first film we caught a glimpse of life underground for some of the survivors of the mysterious Blast. Now dodge mushroom clouds and savage marauders who worship the Rule Book of Football.  See a doomsday prepper dress like a cheerleader. And watch Harry Trumbull our hero fight alongside warrior librarians to save a world already wrecked!
The Team Reunites!
Hot on the heels of the short film ""Judges"",  which is heading for the festivals (I was one of the producers of the Alan Chamberlain short film), and as ""After The Blast"" nears completion, we have begun gathering the personnel, building the sets and models, and writing the next installment of this crazy post-apocalyptic comedy-saga.

The Adventure Continues...
Our hero, Harry Trumbull, having been rescued and then sent off by the dwellers of the Presidential Emergency Disaster Shelter, now wanders the Wasteland in search of his ex-wife and millennial son. But his quest will be interrupted by the startling discovery of powerful groups of survivors who make war on one another for dominance: tribalistic football teams who look (and act) like the bad guys from ""Mad Max"", Wall Street raiders who now really are ""dog eat dog"" and ""cutthroat"", and machine gun-wielding librarians defending the world's last treasure house of knowledge, literature, art, beauty, and plant life. Harry just wants reconciliation with his ex, he wants to spend more time with his son, he wants to have a better relationship with his son's step dad the ""I told you so"" doomsday prepper, he wants some kind of normal life, but he's not going to get it - not just yet.
First, Harry has to do the whole Hero-Of-The-Wasteland/Save-The-World thing.
How You Can Make This Happen.

Now, obviously we are starting from the beginning of the process for this film. ""After The Blast"" had the benefit of being mostly completed before its fundraising campaign began. So we will be raising more funds this time to facilitate the complete process, and also we will once again utilize the production techniques that we have developed at Crows Nest to deliver high quality without high cost.
""After The Blast 2: After After The Blast: The Gridiron Wasteland"" will make extensive use of practical miniature sets and vehicles and buildings, giving it its signature retro feel. In addition to the hard models and props and costumes already in hand, we will be adding Element 3D to our editing facilities. This software will allow us to custom-create scenes of massive armies clashing with total realism and extremely low cost when compared to a Hollywood blockbuster equivalent. 
How Really Good Can Become Great:
We have come up with a budget that guarantees completion but also allows for goals beyond the minimum we require to deliver a picture. 

We made ""After The Blast"" for under $5,000 so as long as we can raise that minimum we will be able to deliver at the very least the level of quality we have in the past.
Raising more funds will make it possible to incrementally add value to the project, both in terms of practical expenses (more special effects/production design) and time (more money means a less strenuous shoot schedule. That means fewer problems to solve in post-production, and that saves time and increases value. 
We don't want to put a limit on what we can raise, because we fully intend to develop the ""After The Blast"" property to its maximum potential and want to continually improve our product and most importantly, keep making more.
Starting with a $5,000 base budget, we will add value as we gain more funds.
For example, at a certain level of funding we will add a camera drone which will allow us to orchestrate magnificent vistas of the Wasteland and create a feeling of space and loneliness unachievable in any other way. 
This time around we will be shooting outdoors in addition to the library location we have secured. The desert environs outside of L.A. will provide nature's contribution to our production value.
So, this is the framework we are thinking of for a scaled budget: $5,000- Basic Budget - low shoot days, equipment, props amortized, salaries deferred$8,000 - Budget Plus - We will add the camera drone and more shoot days/locations.$15,000 - ""Full"" Budget - This fulfills the budget breakdown (cost estimations) as written.$15,000 and above - We will add line items to the budget incrementally ""as needed"" to increase the film's value, for example:
More shoot days, more locations

Editor - I cut the 1st ""After The Blast"" but will gladly relinquish the editor's chair.

Stage Rental

Bigger crew (bigger crew means less multitasking, more efficient production)

Better Craft Services and Meals

""Name"" Guest Star Actor

""Hit"" song

""Name"" composer to score the film

Larger epic scenes using many actor ""extras"" in conjunction with computer generated images

More money for promotion, promotional items, promotional events, P.R., Social Media Optimization

Upgraded Website

More money for festival entry

More money for distribution to online platforms for sales.

All of these goals are clearly aimed at publicizing our efforts and monetizing the ""After The Blast"" brand and maintaining it as a going concern.  The Perks.
Our perks are immersive and fun. Part of the joy of creating a ""universe"" like this is being able to extend the experience beyond the movie. By contributing, you are joining us in creating and perpetuating this.

The Impact.
The first ""After The Blast"" short grew out of a workshop that I organized, and we tried to emulate a number of my favorite directors' styles, like Paul Greengrass, Francis Coppola, Stanley Kubrick, Robert Altman, Tony Scott, the writing style of Bill Forsythe. I felt we were successful in that, and so we will continue that tradition into the second film. George Miller, that's a no-brainer. This movie has a heavy element of ""Mad Max"" - the original story was predominantly parody of the original Mad Max movies. What timing. David Lean, Werner Herzog - oh yes, we will be going out of doors to shoot this one, to exotic deserts like the Owens Valley or Mojave. Oh, and then there is football, so get out your ""Rollerball"", your ""Varsity Blues"" - dare I say there will be shades of Steve Sabol here? Hmmm…. And there is a core section involving the siege of a public library that may remind you of John Carpenter's ""Assault on Precinct 13"", which by the way has some very funny moments. More proof you can make something funny in the middle of catastrophe.
And ""After The Blast 2: After After The Blast: The Gridiron Wasteland"" is a cliffhanger, leading straight into the third chapter and the revelation of the secret of our Wasteland!
You can be a part of this. You can in fact be the force that makes this adventure not only possible, but wildly successful.  We are paving the way for more and bigger adventures and new films.    Risks & Challenges

Though grand in scale and location, the core scenes will center around set pieces and most importantly, the characters. Reference ""Assault on Precinct 13"" (the 1976 John Carpenter film, not, I repeat, not the remake) and you can see how a little crafty filmmaking on a low budget can stretch ""four people in a room talking"" into ""four people in a room under siege by a nameless horde"".

And remember, this is a short film, which lightens the load somewhat when it comes to the number of rabbits we are going to be pulling out of our hats when it comes to our visual trickery.  And, we are at a kind of magical moment in time, where easily accessible technology makes great leaps possible by providing the small-scale filmmaker with the tools of a master.
Clearly, this is a particular style of cinema. But for us, ""low budget"" does not mean low quality. It means I am writing the script with built-in ""Crows Nest Customization"", carefully crafting it to tell a grand story without having to hurdle obstacles of money and time by knowing inside and out our capabilities as a filmmaking group. It means actor/producer Mark Taormino (who is also one of the stars of ""After The Blast"") will provide his complete and wholly owned camera equipment package free of charge. It means Crows Nest Vertical Pictures has its own prop and costume collection, with an emphasis on sci-fi/military. It means there are vastly talented people willing to take a chance on the success of a project they can directly affect for the better.  And it means we live and produce in Los Angeles, the greatest source of talented, trained, educated, dedicated and experienced film artists, technicians and actors in the history of the world.
Most importantly, we shoot well-crafted scripts that tell compelling stories that despite the over-the-top subject and style are always about the landscape of the human soul, the human experience, where we've been and where we're going. The short film I co-produced with Mark Taormino, director Alan Chamberlain's  ""Judges"", is a great example of that dramatic exploration. It also shows clearly our level of capability in terms of quality and visual style. This project was done with the same ways and means as ""After The Blast"", but without the benefit of a fundraising campaign. I think the results are spectacular.
And we are blessed to have such great talent eager to help us fulfill our visions and achieve our overarching mission: to present movie-watching experiences as fun and fulfilling as any other.
So the question is not so much ""Can we do it?"" because we've done it, going on twice now. The question is, ""How far can we take this?""
And the answer is in your hands.

You have the power to make it all happen, and to be along for the ride. You can be the wind in our sails as we continue to develop ""After The Blast"" as a going concern.
We will be here, keeping you updated on all things ""After After The Blast"" and taking you to the Wasteland - and beyond….
Thank you!   Other Ways You Can Help We know some of you may want to support this project but just can't contribute. If you have a special skill, a special prop or costume, or even know of a location or other asset that would enhance our story, please feel free to contact us here. (I know for a fact we're going to be on the hunt for some football equipment.)
Also, making some noise about our campaign can be equally helpful. (Indiegogo has great share tools that make it easy to get the word out.) Folks might find what we are doing as filmmakers and how we are approaching the process to be an interesting story to follow. As the campaign progresses, we hope to provide entertaining updates so it will be fun to check back in.

<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; font-size: 16px; line-height: 26px; background-color: initial;""></span></p>
<i>The Biltmore Academy</i> is about a little boy who doesn’t understand why he can’t wear his favorite dress to school. His private school, The Biltmore Academy, has a rule that all boys need to wear slacks. This rule makes no sense to Nicholas, a smart and curious 6-year-old who would much rather prefer to wear a nice dress every day. <br/><br/><p>His mother, Nadine, agrees with his choice, and will support him no matter what. His other mother, Susan, comes from a different perspective. She’s the one who has to get him dressed in the morning, and has to manage the temper tantrums when Nicholas is forced to wear boy’s clothing. She’s the one who has to endure the withering stares of other mothers who don’t approve of Nicholas’s unconventional preferences. Susan has to enforce a rule that she doesn’t believe in – that boys have to be one way and girls another – so that Nicholas can get the benefits of an elite education. But is education worth it if Nicholas is miserable every day? Are these rules worth following if they threaten Susan and Nadine’s marriage?<br/><br/>Nicholas doesn’t have any political agenda – he’s just a little boy who likes what he likes. It’s his mothers, a lawyer and an actress, who have to reconcile their beliefs with the realities of this world. Sometimes we have to pretend to be something that we’re not in order to succeed. But is this a lesson a 6 year old needs to learn? At what age is personal compromise necessary? How old are we allowed to get before we’re no longer allowed to be ourselves? <br/><br/>Based on the screenwriter’s play, <i>The Biltmore Academy</i> is a short film about visibility, identity, and acceptance. It’s about a pair of progressive parents who struggle to find the right tools and vocabulary to help their son through an unusually difficult early childhood. It’s about a little boy who doesn’t even know that he’s different. He just knows what kind of clothes he likes to wear.<br/></p>
<p></p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need</h3> <p></p>
</div>In order to make sure this film reaches a wide audience we need to use sound and video recording equipment of a professional caliber. We will be shooting on an F7, a new Sony 35mm affordable yet very high quality camera that cuts down on color editing costs due to its dynamic range and low contrast image. We will also be using boom and body (lavaliere microphones) to create a professionally clear sound for the film. Not only are lavaliere body microphones important for isolating voices to create a high quality of sound, they are an absolute necessity when working with child actors to be sure their voices can be heard clearly. Though we have a script, we will be improvising a portion of this film. So it is especially important to make sure the sound support for our main character Nicholas, age 6, is in place to capture what he is saying in those improvised moments or the text, which will be in his own words, may be lost. Many films that make it into major film festivals (Sundance, Tribeca Film Festival, Cannes, OutFest), which reach large audiences, use similar equipment.<div>
<br/><div>In addition to equipment all meals, set dressings, props, editing, insurance, wardrobe, labor, and location/travel expenses will be drawn from our $3K budget. All actors, artists, and creatives involved in this project will be working for meals, copy, and credit only on this project. We are operating under a SAG Short Film Agreement. </div>
<div>
<br/>Our total budget for this film, including equipment donated by Columbia University is projected to be $3K.<div>

<br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src="""" src="""" style=""""/>However, filmmaking is not much developed in Mauritius. Well, despite all odds, I still have the ambition of making my own film about a guy who has inspired me since my childhood and continues to do so nowadays... his name is Clark Kent. We call him Superman.. I've always been that kind of person who wants to help people out of their trouble. I think that in the world we are living now, we need more and more people who devote their time and efforts in helping each other. Just imagine a world like that..full of compassion, love and consideration for each other. In fact, this is one of the reasons why i want to do that film. I want people to be inspired by this Superhero in their daily life. I not only want to promote filmmaking in Mauritius, but also want to get people to adopt a new way of life, to show to the youth that they can achieve what they want, if they believe in it and in themselves. Look at me for instance, i have got the passion, the ambition, the dream, the actors, the support from family and friends...but unfortunately no funds. And that is why i'm turning to you today. I will never let go.</p>
<p>For sure, the money will go into the purchase of the following equipment: lights, microphone, lenses, Audio Gear, Camera Gear like Cameras, Lenses, Rigs (dollies, sliders), Better Locations , Green Screen, Studio Rentals, Post Production Plugins &amp; Software (Better VFX) etc.. I have started to save and invest in the following: 1 light, some gears, and lens filters. </p>
<p>This is a non-profit passion project! all the money raised will be invested in making my childhood dream turn into a reality... heartfelt thanks to you in contributing and above all believing in such a special project...for me, for young people, for us.</p>

I think that in the world we are living now, we need more and more people who devote their time and efforts in helping each other. Just imagine a world like that..full of compassion, love and consideration for each other. In fact, this is one of the reasons why i want to do that film. I want people to be inspired by this Superhero in their daily life. I not only want to promote filmmaking in Mauritius, but also want to get people to adopt a new way of life, to show to the youth that they can achieve what they want, if they believe in it and in themselves. Look at me for instance, i have got the passion, the ambition, the dream, the actors, the support from family and friends...but unfortunately no funds. And that is why i'm turning to you today. I will never let go.
For sure, the money will go into the purchase of the following equipment: lights, microphone, lenses, Audio Gear, Camera Gear like Cameras, Lenses, Rigs (dollies, sliders), Better Locations , Green Screen, Studio Rentals, Post Production Plugins & Software (Better VFX) etc.. I have started to save and invest in the following: 1 light, some gears, and lens filters. 
This is a non-profit passion project! all the money raised will be invested in making my childhood dream turn into a reality... heartfelt thanks to you in contributing and above all believing in such a special project...for me, for young people, for us.
P.S : Please also see below link to a newspaper release about my project. ( it's in French )

<p> </p>
<p>Originally started as just a culinary road-trip vacation, Car to Farm is a project that was born out of the idea to further explore the homemade side of cooking in the Italian countryside by creating a web-series and accompanying cookbook.</p>
<p>My name is Mauro- I was born and raised in Northern Italy where I lived with my family until I traveled to NYC and have called it home since. <span>For as long as I can remember, my Italian upbringing has always been influenced by what was on my plate. Food was a way to reminisce about my childhood, family memories and vacations to special places. By retracing the thoughts of similar road-trips my Mom and I had back when I was just a kid, Car to Farm not only served as a way to honor and celebrate my family culinary traditions, but also provided inspirational and informative content that was filmed to be used for a web-series. </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span><span>We traveled throughout the North of Italy to the center of the peninsula and back around on a journey that took us to local farms (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agritourism"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">agriturismi</a>), food producers, and small <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trattoria"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">trattorie</a> (restaurants). We interviewed our hosts and lived a day in their lives at their country homes or workplaces. </span><span>At the end of each visit, all of our contacts gave us a quick and simple recipe using a few, fresh ingredients that can easily be made in your own kitchen. </span><span>The food, stories, and inspirations gathered from these culinary experiences will soon become a cookbook for all to enjoy.</span></span></p>
<p><span>In today's society, we realize people are losing their connection to food. Instead of relying </span><span>on restaurants and supermarkets as nutritional advisors, we need to educate ourselves and reverse the general idea of food acting as just a basic energy source. Our goal is to deliver this knowledge through the Car to Farm series.</span></p>

<p>I describe Food with a “capital F” because to me, it expresses more than just what nourishes our bodies; it feeds our heart and soul; it captures our senses. Food is culture, tradition, and most of all, information. Where, how and with whom, are important aspects that enhance our entire dining experience. </p>
<p>In Italy, the art of dining is traditionally ingrained in our culture. When we eat, the food radiates the same passion and respect that we put in making it. Those who sit at the table, or even cook our food, influence not only our meals, but our mood and spirits.</p>

<p>Most of the actual production has already been done by Mauro's personal resources. However, what's left is the most important part- the storytelling! (also known as post-production.)</p>
<ul>
<li>Video Editing: the most time-consuming component, many hours will be invested in translating material to find the perfect combination of images and conversations, so that the content can be an enjoyable experience by our English and Italian speaking viewers!</li>
<li>Soundtrack: this will help set the tone to make all the different scenes unforgettable. </li>
<li>Cookbook: shopping, cooking, and shooting the food recipes in the studio with a professional photographer, designing the layers and illustrating it with amazing cartoons and graphics that will appeal to all readers.</li>
</ul>
<p>If we don't reach our target, the money that is collected will be used to move the project forward, while respecting the perks distribution as promised.</p>
<p>If things go extremely well and we go above-and-beyond our target, we will use the money to enhance the marketing campaign leading to the publishing of each episode and the launch of the cookbook. </p>
<p>No matter what the outcome, THANKS A TON for your contribution and support. I hope this project serves as an inspiration to anyone who embarks on their own production despite having a small amount of resources available.</p>

<h3> </h3>
<p>Three weeks on tour wasn't enough time to see all the beautiful locations and people who wanted to share their stories with us! We were very fortunate, however, to have had the opportunity to experience Italian life in a non-traditional way.  The following places below provided us the content for our episodes:</p>
<p><b>NEW YORK CITY:</b></p>
<p>Our journey started in NYC with the help of some awesome people who collaborated with us from day one. We are grateful to live in such an dynamic, amazing city.</p>
<p><b>Numero 28, Bergen St- </b>Luigi Porceddu loved the idea of Car to Farm so much that he offered us this authentic pizza location where we shot our first Intro video (you can see it in the gallery).</p>
<p><b>Senza Gluten</b>- The only gluten-free restaurant I know that offers a contamination-free kitchen for its customers, thanks to gluten hero, Chef Jemiko Solo.</p>
<p><b>Piccola Cucina, Spring &amp; Prince </b>- Authentic Sicilian food was something that Philip Guardione felt was missing in NYC when he opened his first small kitchen in the West Village with his loyal business partner, Luigi Cetrulo.</p>
<p><b>ITALY:</b></p>
<p><b>Tira Mola &amp; Meseda - Lombardy</b> <span>-<span> Tucked away from the touristic areas, this hidden restaurant in Como has loyal locals coming back year after year! We sat down with owners Patrizia and Massimo </span></span><span style=""background-color: initial;"">in their lovely garden to find out why.</span></p>
<p><b>Ca' del Monte - Lombardy -</b> The two families Vohwinkel and Bodratti, have been woking together for at least a couple of generations to create this beautiful and peaceful retreat on top of the hills between Lombardy and Piedmont.</p>
<p><b>La Bergamasca - Lombardy -</b> Not only does Alan Sartirani cook delicious pizza, but he is so passionate about his oven that he cooks everything in it!</p>
<p><b>Agririfugio Molini - Liguria - </b>You can only get to this little gem by hiking up from sea level or down from the mountain top. When you arrive, the members of the association that manage the place will meet you with a great smile! </p>
<p><b>Sosta Pio XVII - Tuscany -</b> Among many people we met during our tour, Gabriella doesn't consider herself a chef, but rather a ""glorified housewife,"" in the non-traditional sense. Here, there's a cute refurbished old stall where supposedly back in the '700, Pope Pio XVII stopped once for a quick ""bathroom break.""</p>
<p><b>Cucina Giuseppina - Tuscany - </b>Giuseppina Pizzolato's school is a perfect location for tourists who want to experience cooking in an incredible perfectly restored medieval town, all while eating great local homemade food.</p>
<p><b>Agrihouse Bracciano - Lazio -</b> If you have never been in a farm before, this one will satisfy your appetite. Margherita and family will show you around and tell you stories from generations back while serving you food and meats from their land and garden.</p>
<p><b>Masseria del'Oasi - Abruzzo </b>- This nature preserve hosts an education center where you will find a wood and linen laboratory, farro mills, and an astronomy observatory managed by different non-profit associations who operate within the Abruzzo park areas. We met with Fernando di Fabrizio and Damiano Ricci who were our perfect hosts.</p>
<p><b>La Morattina - Romagna </b>- We stayed with Gianluca Stramenga and Isabella while exploring this picturesque region. We arrived just in time for a sunset aperitivo facing their beautiful wine estates and they eagerly shared some wonderful tricks in the kitchen.</p>
<p><b>Additional trip highlights include:</b> a day on an olive oil grove, a meat and cheese farm, and a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trabucco"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">trabucco</a> (an old fishing structure that is now a highly regarded restaurant on the sea!)</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1458701808/f5mw3bzi5o8ssk4b8wig.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Each recipe is designed to be easily replicated at home with ingredients that can be sourced at your local produce, meat, and fish stores.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/eJWxmAL5qLl1yZq3R0qPKqJ98OL4N0-hgr84eYDtF5VTJ7dG8w1reHVNuXfpsODYwrh5hrxkgV611KFcF1OQpDjIiOPtTNE6ChRGexvDGd1gULy-XaXgonsD8mGA_aaTORvW-GDE"" src="""" style=""width: 279.433px;height: 417px;""/></p>
<p>The cookbook will feature all the recipes from the tour using seasonal ingredients in a variety of ways- healthy pastas, seafood, and a lot of fresh vegetable dishes are some ideas you can expect. Both options for an e-book and on-demand print will be available.</p>The book will be shot by professional food photographer, Evi Abeler and illustrated by cartoonist, Rafael Villegas.<p> </p>

<p><b>Mauro Clerici - Writer and Producer</b></p>

<h4>Mamma Franca - Awesome Mom &amp; Professional Foodie</h4>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/W5RZzIbogKrBT0Jm3RPyEt7xgnxcOgKCKDpggZBQbmBjLx--JTayzuLDp2oTOp5mZwS3efkVkA2-5kF8NFS-1_n7LVuCLdTfsUxgcWCFedDNaVUEzgsP4V7Jqrt6GD1Npg0dZG-I"" src="""" style=""width: 345px;height: 230px;""/></p>
<p>Franca is Mauro's idol and the person behind Mauro's upbringing. It is easy to get intoxicated by her positive energy and do-what-you-love philosophy. She used to take Mauro on spontaneous vacations, without a reservation or a destination, stopping only where it felt good and where the food looked good.  </p>

Da sempre, l’essere italiano ha un’influenza sui piatti che scelgo di mettere sulla mia tavola; il cibo per me significa ricordare i momenti felici della mia infanzia, il tempo trascorso in famiglia e le vacanze in luoghi speciali. </p><p>Quando ero piccolo viaggiavo spesso in auto con la mia mamma, ed è ripensando a queste eccitanti avventure che ho creato Vai Dove Ti Porta il Cuoco, un omaggio alle tradizioni culinarie della mia famiglia e una fonte di ispirazione per i video che abbiamo filmato e che sono diventati una serie web. </p><p>Abbiamo attraversato il nord d’Italia per arrivare al centro della penisola e tornare indietro, in un viaggio che ci ha portati alla scoperta di numerosi agriturismi, produttori agricoli e trattorie rustiche. I nostri ospiti ci hanno accolto con generosità permettendoci di trascorrere una giornata vivendo le loro vite, nelle loro case di campagna, osservandoli al lavoro, e regalandoci alla fine di ogni visita la ricetta di un piatto semplice e veloce, preparato con ingredienti genuini e che potrai ricreare facilmente nella tua cucina. Il cibo, i racconti e i sogni condivisi con noi durante questi incontri saranno racchiusi in un ricettario a cui tutti potranno ispirarsi per mettere sulla loro tavola piatti deliziosi.</p><p>A noi sembra che nella società contemporanea, il legame della gente con il cibo si stia affievolendo sempre di più. Dobbiamo rieducare noi stessi a non considerare ciò che mangiamo una mera fonte di energia e dobbiamo evitare che ristoranti e supermercati diventino i nostri consulenti nutrizionali. Con Vai Dove Ti Porta il Cuoco vogliamo offrire a tutti l’opportunità di riscoprire l’amore e la passione per la preparazione di pietanze appetitose con ingredienti naturali.<span style=""font-size: 24px;font-weight: bold;letter-spacing: 0px;line-height: 30px;background-color: initial;""> </span></p><h3> </h3><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1458702180/faoqesxt8tll7p1alttc.jpg"" src=""""/></p><h3> </h3><p>Parlo di Cibo con la “C maiuscola” perché il cibo per me non è solo nutrimento per il corpo, ma è anche nutrimento per il cuore e l’anima, e ci permette di vivere un’esperienza che soddisfa tutti i nostri sensi.</p><p>L’arte culinaria è radicata nella cultura e nelle tradizioni dell’Italia, un paese in cui il cibo è per tradizione cultura e, soprattutto, conoscenza.</p><p>Dove, come e con chi sono elementi importanti che definiscono la nostra esperienza gastronomica. </p><p>Quando mangiamo, il cibo trasmette la stessa passione e lo stesso rispetto con cui è stato preparato e le persone con cui scegliamo di cucinare e condividere i nostri pasti influenzano i sapori della nostra tavola e anche il nostro stato d’animo. </p><h3> </h3><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1458702214/hx0pj9ycbfnoqlk16kqx.jpg"" src=""""/></p><div>
<p><span>Gran parte della produzione è già stata portata a termine grazie al lavoro di Mauro.</span></p>
<p>Ma la parte più importante è raccontare la storia nel modo giusto!</p>
<p>La cosiddetta post-produzione.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Il montaggio è la parte che richiede più tempo. Vengono dedicate molte ore alla traduzione del materiale perché immagini e parole siano in armonia, e guardare i video sia un’esperienza piacevole sia per il nostro pubblico inglese sia per quello italiano.</p></li>
<li><p>La colonna sonora sarà fondamentale per creare l’atmosfera giusta e rendere le scene indimenticabili.</p></li>
<li><p>Per il ricettario utilizzeremo ingredienti accuratamente selezionati, cucineremo e, in uno studio, un professionista immortalerà le nostre ricette con delle fotografie che verranno elaborate e a cui verranno aggiunti fumetti e grafiche che divertiranno i nostri lettori.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Se non raggiungeremo la cifra prefissata, il denaro raccolto verrà utilizzato per passare alle fasi successive dello sviluppo del progetto, rispettando gli impegni finanziari presi.</p>
<p>Se le cose andranno benissimo e supereremo la cifra prefissata, investiremo di più nella campagna marketing per la messa in onda di ogni episodio e per la pubblicazione del ricettario.</p>
<p>In qualsiasi modo vada, GRAZIE INFINITE a tutti per la vostra collaborazione e il vostro supporto! Spero che questo progetto serva da ispirazione a chiunque desideri avventurarsi in una produzione propria con risorse limitate a disposizione.</p>

Originally started as just a culinary road-trip vacation, Car to Farm is a project that was born out of the idea to further explore the homemade side of cooking in the Italian countryside by creating a web-series and accompanying cookbook.
My name is Mauro- I was born and raised in Northern Italy where I lived with my family until I traveled to NYC and have called it home since. For as long as I can remember, my Italian upbringing has always been influenced by what was on my plate. Food was a way to reminisce about my childhood, family memories and vacations to special places. By retracing the thoughts of similar road-trips my Mom and I had back when I was just a kid, Car to Farm not only served as a way to honor and celebrate my family culinary traditions, but also provided inspirational and informative content that was filmed to be used for a web-series. 
 
We traveled throughout the North of Italy to the center of the peninsula and back around on a journey that took us to local farms (agriturismi), food producers, and small trattorie (restaurants). We interviewed our hosts and lived a day in their lives at their country homes or workplaces. At the end of each visit, all of our contacts gave us a quick and simple recipe using a few, fresh ingredients that can easily be made in your own kitchen. The food, stories, and inspirations gathered from these culinary experiences will soon become a cookbook for all to enjoy.
In today's society, we realize people are losing their connection to food. Instead of relying on restaurants and supermarkets as nutritional advisors, we need to educate ourselves and reverse the general idea of food acting as just a basic energy source. Our goal is to deliver this knowledge through the Car to Farm series.
 
 
 
 
 

 
I describe Food with a “capital F” because to me, it expresses more than just what nourishes our bodies; it feeds our heart and soul; it captures our senses. Food is culture, tradition, and most of all, information. Where, how and with whom, are important aspects that enhance our entire dining experience. 
In Italy, the art of dining is traditionally ingrained in our culture. When we eat, the food radiates the same passion and respect that we put in making it. Those who sit at the table, or even cook our food, influence not only our meals, but our mood and spirits.
 

Most of the actual production has already been done by Mauro's personal resources. However, what's left is the most important part- the storytelling! (also known as post-production.)

Video Editing: the most time-consuming component, many hours will be invested in translating material to find the perfect combination of images and conversations, so that the content can be an enjoyable experience by our English and Italian speaking viewers!
Soundtrack: this will help set the tone to make all the different scenes unforgettable. 
Cookbook: shopping, cooking, and shooting the food recipes in the studio with a professional photographer, designing the layers and illustrating it with amazing cartoons and graphics that will appeal to all readers.

If we don't reach our target, the money that is collected will be used to move the project forward, while respecting the perks distribution as promised.
If things go extremely well and we go above-and-beyond our target, we will use the money to enhance the marketing campaign leading to the publishing of each episode and the launch of the cookbook. 
No matter what the outcome, THANKS A TON for your contribution and support. I hope this project serves as an inspiration to anyone who embarks on their own production despite having a small amount of resources available.
 
 
 




 


 
Three weeks on tour wasn't enough time to see all the beautiful locations and people who wanted to share their stories with us! We were very fortunate, however, to have had the opportunity to experience Italian life in a non-traditional way.  The following places below provided us the content for our episodes:
NEW YORK CITY:
Our journey started in NYC with the help of some awesome people who collaborated with us from day one. We are grateful to live in such an dynamic, amazing city.
Numero 28, Bergen St- Luigi Porceddu loved the idea of Car to Farm so much that he offered us this authentic pizza location where we shot our first Intro video (you can see it in the gallery).
Senza Gluten- The only gluten-free restaurant I know that offers a contamination-free kitchen for its customers, thanks to gluten hero, Chef Jemiko Solo.
Piccola Cucina, Spring & Prince - Authentic Sicilian food was something that Philip Guardione felt was missing in NYC when he opened his first small kitchen in the West Village with his loyal business partner, Luigi Cetrulo.
ITALY:
Tira Mola & Meseda - Lombardy - Tucked away from the touristic areas, this hidden restaurant in Como has loyal locals coming back year after year! We sat down with owners Patrizia and Massimo in their lovely garden to find out why.
Ca' del Monte - Lombardy - The two families Vohwinkel and Bodratti, have been woking together for at least a couple of generations to create this beautiful and peaceful retreat on top of the hills between Lombardy and Piedmont.
La Bergamasca - Lombardy - Not only does Alan Sartirani cook delicious pizza, but he is so passionate about his oven that he cooks everything in it!
Agririfugio Molini - Liguria - You can only get to this little gem by hiking up from sea level or down from the mountain top. When you arrive, the members of the association that manage the place will meet you with a great smile! 
Sosta Pio XVII - Tuscany - Among many people we met during our tour, Gabriella doesn't consider herself a chef, but rather a ""glorified housewife,"" in the non-traditional sense. Here, there's a cute refurbished old stall where supposedly back in the '700, Pope Pio XVII stopped once for a quick ""bathroom break.""
Cucina Giuseppina - Tuscany - Giuseppina Pizzolato's school is a perfect location for tourists who want to experience cooking in an incredible perfectly restored medieval town, all while eating great local homemade food.
Agrihouse Bracciano - Lazio - If you have never been in a farm before, this one will satisfy your appetite. Margherita and family will show you around and tell you stories from generations back while serving you food and meats from their land and garden.
Masseria del'Oasi - Abruzzo - This nature preserve hosts an education center where you will find a wood and linen laboratory, farro mills, and an astronomy observatory managed by different non-profit associations who operate within the Abruzzo park areas. We met with Fernando di Fabrizio and Damiano Ricci who were our perfect hosts.
La Morattina - Romagna - We stayed with Gianluca Stramenga and Isabella while exploring this picturesque region. We arrived just in time for a sunset aperitivo facing their beautiful wine estates and they eagerly shared some wonderful tricks in the kitchen.
Additional trip highlights include: a day on an olive oil grove, a meat and cheese farm, and a trabucco (an old fishing structure that is now a highly regarded restaurant on the sea!)
 

 
Each recipe is designed to be easily replicated at home with ingredients that can be sourced at your local produce, meat, and fish stores.

The cookbook will feature all the recipes from the tour using seasonal ingredients in a variety of ways- healthy pastas, seafood, and a lot of fresh vegetable dishes are some ideas you can expect. Both options for an e-book and on-demand print will be available.The book will be shot by professional food photographer, Evi Abeler and illustrated by cartoonist, Rafael Villegas. 
 
 

Mauro Clerici - Writer and Producer

Mauro is the crazy guy behind this whole production. During the day, he is a Health Coach and Colorpuncture therapist. Producing a project of this magnitude for the first time has been a great challenge, so thanks in advance for any help you will provide! Enjoy the beautiful scenic and food images of Italy!
Mamma Franca - Awesome Mom & Professional Foodie

Franca is Mauro's idol and the person behind Mauro's upbringing. It is easy to get intoxicated by her positive energy and do-what-you-love philosophy. She used to take Mauro on spontaneous vacations, without a reservation or a destination, stopping only where it felt good and where the food looked good.  


Olivia Booker - Tour Director of Photography

Olivia is an artist and documentary filmmaker based in Northern California.  She received a Bachelor's in Studio Art from Davidson College, and is currently pursuing an MFA in Documentary Film at Stanford University.  Olivia has worked on a wide range of film projects, but her passion lies in nonfiction storytelling.

Evan Garfield- Cookbook Chef

Evan works in children's music therapy, which is already cool on its own. Evan and his good friend/roommate Adam, also operate a speakeasy-type event space within their Brooklyn apartment, where he cooks for the various functions they host. Our kind of place!
 
Evi Abeler- Cookbook Photographer

Evi grow up in rural Germany and lived the real farm-to-table experience. Today she is a respected and talented food photographer working for several media outlets like About.com, Food & Wine Magazine, Rodale, HarperCollins, the Food Network and Whole Foods Markets.
Silvia Gallico - Translator and Localization of Contents

 

Silvia loves everything which is art and creativity and translating is the passion of her life. Every project is a journey into a different world. Translating to her is knowledge and freedom. With Car to Farm she finds a way to reconnect with her beloved country. Silvia eats Food with a capital F.

#BeepBeep

#BeepBeep is our official Car To Farm mascot- the ""cinquecento"" in miniature size. She represents all the Italian vacations Mauro would take with his mom during the summers of his youth. During summer 2015, she found love, a local attractive tractor from Romagna.

Italiano   Un viaggio in macchina alla scoperta di itinerari gastronomici è diventato Vai Dove Ti Porta il Cuoco, un progetto ispirato dal desiderio di scoprire i segreti della cucina casereccia tradizionale della campagna italiana. Mi chiamo Mauro, sono nato e cresciuto nel nord d’Italia dove ho vissuto con la mia famiglia fino a quando mi sono trasferito a New York che ormai considero la mia casa. Da sempre, l’essere italiano ha un’influenza sui piatti che scelgo di mettere sulla mia tavola; il cibo per me significa ricordare i momenti felici della mia infanzia, il tempo trascorso in famiglia e le vacanze in luoghi speciali. Quando ero piccolo viaggiavo spesso in auto con la mia mamma, ed è ripensando a queste eccitanti avventure che ho creato Vai Dove Ti Porta il Cuoco, un omaggio alle tradizioni culinarie della mia famiglia e una fonte di ispirazione per i video che abbiamo filmato e che sono diventati una serie web. Abbiamo attraversato il nord d’Italia per arrivare al centro della penisola e tornare indietro, in un viaggio che ci ha portati alla scoperta di numerosi agriturismi, produttori agricoli e trattorie rustiche. I nostri ospiti ci hanno accolto con generosità permettendoci di trascorrere una giornata vivendo le loro vite, nelle loro case di campagna, osservandoli al lavoro, e regalandoci alla fine di ogni visita la ricetta di un piatto semplice e veloce, preparato con ingredienti genuini e che potrai ricreare facilmente nella tua cucina. Il cibo, i racconti e i sogni condivisi con noi durante questi incontri saranno racchiusi in un ricettario a cui tutti potranno ispirarsi per mettere sulla loro tavola piatti deliziosi.A noi sembra che nella società contemporanea, il legame della gente con il cibo si stia affievolendo sempre di più. Dobbiamo rieducare noi stessi a non considerare ciò che mangiamo una mera fonte di energia e dobbiamo evitare che ristoranti e supermercati diventino i nostri consulenti nutrizionali. Con Vai Dove Ti Porta il Cuoco vogliamo offrire a tutti l’opportunità di riscoprire l’amore e la passione per la preparazione di pietanze appetitose con ingredienti naturali.   Parlo di Cibo con la “C maiuscola” perché il cibo per me non è solo nutrimento per il corpo, ma è anche nutrimento per il cuore e l’anima, e ci permette di vivere un’esperienza che soddisfa tutti i nostri sensi.L’arte culinaria è radicata nella cultura e nelle tradizioni dell’Italia, un paese in cui il cibo è per tradizione cultura e, soprattutto, conoscenza.Dove, come e con chi sono elementi importanti che definiscono la nostra esperienza gastronomica. Quando mangiamo, il cibo trasmette la stessa passione e lo stesso rispetto con cui è stato preparato e le persone con cui scegliamo di cucinare e condividere i nostri pasti influenzano i sapori della nostra tavola e anche il nostro stato d’animo.  
Gran parte della produzione è già stata portata a termine grazie al lavoro di Mauro.
Ma la parte più importante è raccontare la storia nel modo giusto!
La cosiddetta post-produzione.

Il montaggio è la parte che richiede più tempo. Vengono dedicate molte ore alla traduzione del materiale perché immagini e parole siano in armonia, e guardare i video sia un’esperienza piacevole sia per il nostro pubblico inglese sia per quello italiano.
La colonna sonora sarà fondamentale per creare l’atmosfera giusta e rendere le scene indimenticabili.
Per il ricettario utilizzeremo ingredienti accuratamente selezionati, cucineremo e, in uno studio, un professionista immortalerà le nostre ricette con delle fotografie che verranno elaborate e a cui verranno aggiunti fumetti e grafiche che divertiranno i nostri lettori.

Se non raggiungeremo la cifra prefissata, il denaro raccolto verrà utilizzato per passare alle fasi successive dello sviluppo del progetto, rispettando gli impegni finanziari presi.
Se le cose andranno benissimo e supereremo la cifra prefissata, investiremo di più nella campagna marketing per la messa in onda di ogni episodio e per la pubblicazione del ricettario.
In qualsiasi modo vada, GRAZIE INFINITE a tutti per la vostra collaborazione e il vostro supporto! Spero che questo progetto serva da ispirazione a chiunque desideri avventurarsi in una produzione propria con risorse limitate a disposizione.
 
 


 Tre settimane di tour non sono state sufficienti per visitare tutte le meravigliose località dell’Italia e incontrare tutte le persone che volevano condividere la loro storia con noi, ma siamo stati molto fortunati ad avere l’opportunità di essere coinvolti nella vita di alcune persone che ci hanno accolto come facessimo parte della loro famiglia.NEW YORK CITY Il nostro viaggio è cominciato qui, grazie all’aiuto di alcune persone eccezionali che hanno collaborato con noi sin dal primo giorno. Adoriamo la nostra città, così dinamica e stimolante.I seguenti luoghi fanno parte dei contenuti della nostra serie:Numero 28, Bergen St- Luigi Porceddu era così entusiasta del progetto Vai Dove Ti Porta il Cuoco che ci ha permesso di utilizzare la sua autentica pizzeria come location per girare il nostro primo video che puoi trovare nella galleria.   Senza Gluten- L’unico ristorante senza glutine che conosco dove la cucina è assolutamente sterile. Un ringraziamento speciale al nostro eroe del glutine, lo chef Jemiko Solo.Piccola Cucina, Spring & Prince- Philip Gaurdione aveva nostalgia del cibo siciliano così, con l’aiuto del suo socio Luigi Cetrulo, decise di aprire la sua prima piccola cucina nel West Village offrendo ai newyorchesi l’opportunità di scoprire i sapori della sua terra. ITALIA  Tira Mola & Meseda - Lombardia- Questa gemma rara, nel cuore di Como e lontana dagli affollati siti turistici, ha clienti che continuano a tornare anno dopo anno! Ci siamo seduti nel loro giardino fiorito in compagnia dei proprietari Patrizia e Massimo per scoprire il perché.Ca’ del Monte - Lombardia- Le due famiglie Vohwinkel e Bodratti lavorano insieme da almeno due generazioni in questo incantevole agriturismo sulle colline fra la Lombardia e il Piemonte, un luogo sereno, all’insegna della tranquillità.La Bergamasca - Lombardia- Alan Sartirani ha due grandi passioni: la sua pizza deliziosa e il suo forno che usa per cuocere tutte le pietanze!Agririfugio Molini - Liguria- Una perla nascosta fra i colli liguri, nel cuore del Parco di Portofino, raggiungibile esclusivamente a piedi. Al tuo arrivo, i membri dell’associazione che gestiscono questo posto ti accoglieranno calorosamente con un magnifico sorriso!Sosta Pio XVII - Toscana- Fra le persone che abbiamo incontrato durante il nostro tour c’è Gabriella che non si considera un vero e proprio chef, piuttosto una “semplice casalinga”, nel senso non tradizionale del termine. La storia vuole che questo antico casale sia stato dimora, nella notte del 2 giugno 1815, di Papa Pio VII, costretto a fermarsi da una impellente “necessità fisica”.Cucina Giuseppina - Toscana- La scuola di Giuseppina Pizzolato si trova in una posizione perfetta per i turisti che desiderano assaporare la cucina italiana casereccia in un borgo medievale perfettamente restaurato.Agrihouse Bracciano - Lazio- Se non hai mai visto una fattoria prima d’ora questo è il posto perfetto per soddisfare la tua curiosità e saziare il tuo appetito. Margherita e la sua famiglia ti sveleranno i segreti di questo posto e ti racconteranno storie tramandate di generazione in generazione servendoti cibi e carni di loro produzione.Masseria dell’Oasi - Abruzzo- Questa riserva naturale ospita un centro educativo, dove troverai laboratori di falegnameria e di tessitura del lino, frantoi per il farro, e un osservatorio astronomico, gestito da varie organizzazioni di beneficenza che si occupano della conservazione dei parchi naturali abruzzesi. Abbiamo incontrato Fernando di Fabrizio e Damiano Ricci che ci hanno offerto un’accoglienza calorosa.La Morattina - Romagna- Siamo stati ospiti di Gianluca Stramenga e di Isabella mentre esploravamo questa regione pittoresca. Siamo arrivati qui in tempo per un aperitivo al tramonto con vista sul panorama mozzafiato della loro vigna, e in cucina ci hanno anche svelato qualche utile trucchetto. 
Ogni ricetta è pensata per essere preparata nella tua cucina con facilità e con ingredienti reperibili presso le macellerie, le pescherie e i negozi della tua città. 


Il ricettario contiene tutte le ricette preparate durante il tour. È possibile acquistarlo in versione ebook e in formato stampato.Le fotografie saranno scattate dalla fotografa di alimenti professionista, Evi Abeler e le illustrazioni saranno create dal disegnatore Rafael Villegas.

</div></div>","So real talk -Have you heard of Praise Proda? No? Well, check out his music.https://soundcloud.com/praiseprodaThat's cool -Yeah, it's pretty cool. Actually it's pretty f****ing spectacular. At least we know so, but we want the world to know so too and that's why we're letting you know that his new album PRÆY is dropping late 2015 and to celebrate/promote that, we're making a really dope experimental short film for the entire album. It's always been a dream of Proda's to make a short film for his work, especially when his next album is so important to him and to his audience. We're telling the story that many people have lived -- where some have survived and some have lost. It's the stories of the streets, gang life, violence and how some people can't find their way out and to make this project happen, we need your help.Wait, who's we?We're really just an eclectic group of art students with a real passion for filmmaking and the art of storytelling with moving images. All we want to do is tell stories; great stories that could change people and change lives. 








Alright, looks tight ... what do you need? We need your help because unfortunately, good art isn't free and filmmaking is one of the most expensive art forms out there. Your generous donations are going towards the following:
- CAMERA EQUIPMENT AND LIGHTINGWe want this film to look amazing and we can't make one without a camera and necessary equipment to light the scene and make it look amazing. - PRODUCTION DESIGNThis is probably the second most important part of making a film look good. Art helps us create the world the characters live in and dress them appropriately and makes things really cool. This will be priority.- LOCATIONS & GRANTSThis is New York City, and not a lot of people are able to give us cool and film-worthy locations for free. Believe it or not, getting spaces to shoot are expensive and getting permission is even more so. - FESTIVAL AND DISTRIBUTION FEESWhen we finish this, we want this to blow up. We want everyone to see it, we think that people need to see it. Submissions aren't too pricey but it's about $50 a submission and we'll probably send it off to 5 different festivals. Help!

<h2>Introduction:</h2>
<p>My name is Alissa DeGrazia and I am a director, actor and pinup model and I have created this funding platform to raise money for my documentary </p>
<h4><br/></h4>
<h4>Fibromyalgia:  An Invisible Illness </h4>
<div><br/></div>
<div>
<ul>
<li> The film focuses on the lives of people living with Fibromyalgia, a chronic pain disorder </li>
<li>It will begin with my 8 year battle with Fibromyalgia and will springboard into a series of passionate interviews with fellow ""Fibro Warriors""</li>
<li>The documentary will be enhanced by a choreographed dramatic movement piece depicting the daily struggles of this disease</li>
<li>It will also be highlighted by creative monologues/spoken word poetry  </li>
</ul>
<div><br/></div>
<h3>WHY TELL THIS STORY</h3>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Fibromyalgia affects over <b>400</b> thousand Canadians (National ME/FM Action Network)  and <b>5</b> million Americans  (National Institute of Health)</li>
<li>Fibromyalgia is a much maligned and socially misunderstood health issue.  Our ambition is to allow ""Fibro Warriors"" a space in which to discuss their battle with the disease</li>
<li>The hope of this project is to create a starting point for a dialogue about the effects of Fibromyalgia while nurturing a greater understanding and acceptance of the disease</li>
</ul>
<div><br/></div>
</div>
</div>
<h3>What Is Fibromyalgia:</h3>
<div>The Mayo Clinic defines Fibromyalgia as chronic wide spread musculoskeletal pain accompanied by fatigue, sleep memory and mood issues.  It amplifies painful sensations and affects how the brain processes pain signals.  </div>

<h2>A Life Sentence With The Unknown</h2>
<p>Every day is a rollercoaster ride of varying degrees of pain and physical limitations.  Fibromyalgia is an incredibly difficult disease for doctors to diagnose.   There are no blood markers to identify it and generally it takes five years to get a proper diagnosis.  As it stands, the diagnosis is only arrived at after all other tests have been exhausted.  </p>
<p>Once you have been diagnosed, there is no set treatment for you to follow.  It is a series of hit and miss experiments and a constant work in progress.  The common complaint from patients and support organizations is that the quality of life for people with Fibromyalgia is drastically reduced.  Fibromyalgia crates such a widespread and intense sensation of pain that it can render sufferers wheelchair bound without any idea when the pain will subside and how long that will last.  No matter the severity of symptoms, ""Fibro Warriors"" are not able to live life as they once did.  A regular work day becomes virtually impossible and the disease puts an incredible strain on every aspect of life, including finances and relationships.</p>
</div>
<h3><br/></h3>
<h3>My Journey</h3>
<div> The onset of Fibromyalgia in my life can be traced back to incredible emotional stress.  For ten years I was involved in a court case against my grandmother's next door neighbour.  Roughly eight years into the constant parade of court dates, police phone calls, smashed windows and slashed car tires, my body shut down. It took five years of tests for everything from AIDS to lupus to leukaemia to arthritis for me to get a proper diagnosis.  Doctors originally treated the symptoms and the lack of conclusive results as a mental health issue.   After years of struggling with such debilitating pain - a pain which rendered tasks as simple as the brushing of teeth, showering or bathing impossible, I was finally diagnosed with Fibromyalgia and Chronic Fatigue brought on by Post Traumatic Stress Disorder.  </div>

<p>In 1892, the Pueblo of Isleta, New Mexico, enlisted the skills of journalist Charles Lummis to gain the release of their children being held captive at the Albuquerque Indian School.</p>
<p>The final act in America’s 19<sup>th</sup> Century conquest of Native Americans was to forcibly re-educate their children at Indian Boarding Schools.  Here the children could be held without parental permission, while their language, identity and culture were stripped from them and replaced with Anglo versions.  Many Eastern reformers truly believed this was the best way to help a ""dying culture"" assimilate into America.</p>

</div>","Who were Los Cautivos?
In 1892, the Pueblo of Isleta, New Mexico, enlisted the skills of journalist Charles Lummis to gain the release of their children being held captive at the Albuquerque Indian School.
The final act in America’s 19th Century conquest of Native Americans was to forcibly re-educate their children at Indian Boarding Schools.  Here the children could be held without parental permission, while their language, identity and culture were stripped from them and replaced with Anglo versions.  Many Eastern reformers truly believed this was the best way to help a ""dying culture"" assimilate into America.
For three years the children of Isleta were held at the Albuquerque Indian school and were denied any contact with their parents.  The Pueblo enlisted the help of noted journalist Charles Fletcher Lummis who brought their plight to national attention.  The weight of public opinion combined with a law suit, forced the school to return The Captives, Los Cautivos, to their families.
Set against the background of the final Indian Wars and the closing of the Western Frontier, the film uses Lummis’s articles, his photographs along with official records to explore the racial, cultural and religious prejudice that informed politics and determined the national policy. The damage these policies did to family and tribe are examined through interviews with Isletan elders and contemporary graduates of Indian Boarding Schools.

Why this is important:
After generations of mis-education, today’s Native peoples are still subject to State and Federal standards that often don’t take into account community needs and customs.

<p>The Veterans Trauma Support Network (VTSN) is a
tax-exempt not-for-profit (501c3) Florida based organization established to generate and accept tax-exempt monetary and equipment donations
to provide veterans with brain injuries with free primarily neurological
hyperbaric therapy and other alternative forms of trauma therapy. </p>
<p>We are active under the umbrella of CRISIS RELIEF NETWORK who is constantly providing services and therapy to families in trauma and to service men and women living with the invisible wounds of war including combat-related stress, major depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder. </p>
<p>Initially searching for ways to help more families we have discovered effective methods to help trauma survivors. Our main method to assist anyone affected by trauma which changed our organization forever is called <i>Rapid Resolution Therapy</i>  (RRT). We have worked with children, parents, veterans, first responders and childhood abuse survivors with remarkable life changing results, as well as provided many therapy services for trauma patients in need. You can go here for more information on RRT...<a href=""http://www.crisisreliefnetwork.org/programs.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.crisisreliefnetwork.org/programs.html</a></p>

now have these health issues to deal with.</span></p>
<p><i>""There are many different treatments for veterans with PTSD and TBI

<p style=""text-align: center;""><b>
</b></p>
<p>According to The Mayo Clinic (<a href=""http://www.mayoclinic.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.mayoclinic.org</a>) the FDA approved
drugs for PTSD, such as anti-anxiety medication, can relieve severe anxiety and
related problems  for a short time, although because of the potential for
abuse, they are not usually taken long term. They also list the FDA approved
medications for insomnia and nightmares as well as approved antidepressants as
solutions. We feel in some situations drugs can be helpful short term. The goal
is to eventually be able to function without drugs and without the need for
prolonged psychotherapy, living as close to how our veteran’s felt before their
deployment in a natural state of calm and good health.</p>

<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy (HBOT) is unique to any other therapy
used for brain injuries and neurological conditions: It is the only therapy
known that can significantly raise the oxygen content in the brain and cause an
adaptation for repair and quicker recovery for TBI patients such as war
veterans. Neil Young of The Daily News wrote an article about Marine Corps. Lt.
Col. (RET) Alan Burghard, a bronze star and Purple Heart recipient, is quoted
as contributing his TBI improvement to Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy. It is stories
like this that bring hope to us in making this available to more veterans.</span>

<p>Medication affects cognitive abilities. When tissue is injured, it requires even more oxygen to survive. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy increases the amount of oxygen brain blood can carry. An increase in blood oxygen temporarily restores normal levels of blood gases and tissue function to promote healing and fight infection.</p>
<p>In a hyperbaric oxygen therapy room, the air pressure is raised up to three times higher than normal air pressure. Under these conditions, your lungs can gather up to three times more oxygen than would be possible breathing pure oxygen at normal air pressure.</p>
<p>Blood carries this oxygen throughout your body, stimulating the release of substances called growth factors and stem cells, which promote healing.</p>
<p>And so the brain gets a chance to heal and re-establish some of those processes.</p>

applications has got to be immediate HBOT to help recover viable brain tissue
that is compromised and minimally functioning with low oxygen content. This
therapy has proven effectiveness and should now be considered as a primary
treatment option in conjunction with other primary treatments, but insurance
providers still don’t cover the costs for this treatment.</span><br/></p>

<p>The FDA has approved already several treatments based on HBOT, but
not for all kinds of diseases like cancer, multiple-sclerosis, TBI, etc.
 Therefore insurance providers still are not forced to pay for the more
expensive HBOT treatments.  Veterans are suffering in the mean time. Time
is of the essence with brain injuries, the longer they are left without
treatment the more suffering continues. The hope is that the FDA will at some
point in the near future accept HBOT and get it through the approval process.
There are many people working towards this goal, although again, many men and
women are suffering while the process unfolds.</p>

He also initiated the use of HBOT for ataxia-telangectasia. Recently, Dr. Maxfield was also a member of the ethics task force in hyperbaric medicine.</p><p></p><p></p><p>During his service with the navy, Dr. Maxfield worked on the development of many nuclear medicine procedures that are routine today, including more than 1,000 positron brain scans. As a member of the Plutonium Decontamination Team, Dr. Maxfield was introduced to hyperbaric chambers and the field of hyperbaric medicine.</p><p>Upon becoming board certified by the American Board of Radiology in December 1961 with a medallion in Nuclear Medicine, he was promoted to Assistant Professor at Johns Hopkins.</p>Dr. Maxfield is the author of 38 scientific publications, 2 short publications, 12 abstracts,  9 scientific exhibits and a video tape. His 45 years of clinical practice and research including 19 years of clinical hyperbaric medicine provide him a broad base of knowledge. His interest in clinical hyperbaric medicine resurfaced in the mid-1970’s when he searched for assistance for his father-in-law who had developed speech and balance problems. When four top neurological centers could provide no specific diagnosis or treatment, he took his father-in-law to Dr. Richard Neubauer’s center in Lauderdale-by-the-Sea, Florida, for hyperbaric oxygen treatment. The HBOT gave his father-in-law more than four years of independent life.<p>Dr. Maxfield has extensive experience in treatment of stroke, multiple sclerosis, brain trauma, cerebral palsy and congenital problems such as ataxia-telangectasia as well as many other diseases that are treated with HBOT. Dr. Maxfield’s experience in imaging and hyperbaric medicine provide a unique background for his work in developing protocols to diagnose and treat conditions that may benefit from hyperbaric oxygen therapy.</p>Dr. Maxfield comes from a pioneering medical family. He was born in Waco, Texas and grew up in Dallas, Texas, receiving a BA in psychology from Southern Methodist University. He was the fourth member of his family to receive an M.D. degree from Baylor University College of Medicine, Houston, Texas.<p>Dr. Maxfield’s father James R. Maxfield Sr. M.D., in 1903, had the first x-ray unit in Texas for his practice of family and industrial medicine in Grand Saline, Texas. This was only seven years after Roentgen discovered the x-ray. His brothers, James R. Maxfield Jr., M.D. and Jack G.S. Maxfield M.D., were pioneers in the fields of nuclear medicine, radiation oncology, and clinical hyperbaric medicine.</p><p>The Maxfield Clinic-Hospital in Dallas, Texas was one of the first institutions licensed by the Atomic Energy Commission to use radioactive isotopes in clinical medicine and research. In 1955,  the Maxfield Clinic-Hospital installed the third cobalt treatment unit in the USA. Dr. Maxfield and his brothers developed the techniques of treating bone metastasis with radioactive Phosphorus (P32) plus testosterone. They were also co-developers of the technique of implanting radioactive seeds encased in nylon tubes, a technique which is used increasingly today to treat various types of cancer. In 1978 a clinical hyperbaric oxygen therapy program was started at the Maxfield Clinic-Hospital.</p><p>Dr. Maxfield and his brothers were founders of the American College of Hyperbaric Medicine and the American Board of Hyperbaric Medicine. Previously they founded the American College of Nuclear Medicine and were charter members and co-founders of the Southwestern Chapter of the Society of Nuclear Medicine. After serving as President of the American College of Nuclear Medicine, Dr. Maxfield was elected a Fellow of the American College of Nuclear Medicine.</p><p>When he entered active duty with the US Navy in August 1956, he was assigned to the US Navy Hospital, Chelsea, Massachusetts to establish the hospital’s nuclear medicine laboratory because of his experience in nuclear medicine and radiology. He was then transferred to the US Navy Hospital in Bethesda, Maryland where he was chief of the Nuclear Medicine Section of the Department of Radiology and Instructor in Nuclear Medicine at the US Navy Medical School. While at Bethesda Navy Hospital, Dr. Maxfield was part of the USA delegation to the Second International Atoms for Peace Conference in Geneva, Switzerland.

</div></div>","YOU CAN HELP TO GIVE WAR VETERANS WITH
BRAIN INJURY AND POST TRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER AND THEIR FAMILIES A LIFE BACK!

Hello, we are a team of five at the CRISIS RELIEF NETWORK in Orlando, Florida. 

The goal of this fundraiser is to rescue as many at-risk and
injured veterans as possible in order to restore wholeness to their lives. Effective biological repair
treatments therapies like Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy will be made FOR FREE AVAILABLE for
treatment of veterans who suffer from trauma brain injury and
posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), if you help us to succeed !
We think that goal is worth the effort, please help our subdivision the Veterans Trauma Support Network  in the battle for veterans with Brain Injuries (BI) and Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). 
Think about, these patients are totally ""cought up"" by their brain disorder, which acts like a mental prison, and you and me we can help them to ""get back to normal""! 

Our goal here is to create treatment funds to provide FREE Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy (HBOT) to War Veterans with Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) and PTSD (Post Traumatic Stress Disorder), as  HBOT is one of the proven ""Better Care"" solutions to heal INVISIBLE WOUNDS like TBI and PTDS. Think about helping thousands of Wounded War Veterans and their families getting a live back, yeep !

ABOUT CRISIS RELIEF NETWORK & VETERANS TRAUMA SUPPORT NETWORK



The Veterans Trauma Support Network (VTSN) is a
tax-exempt not-for-profit (501c3) Florida based organization established to generate and accept tax-exempt monetary and equipment donations
to provide veterans with brain injuries with free primarily neurological
hyperbaric therapy and other alternative forms of trauma therapy. 
We are active under the umbrella of CRISIS RELIEF NETWORK who is constantly providing services and therapy to families in trauma and to service men and women living with the invisible wounds of war including combat-related stress, major depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder. 
Initially searching for ways to help more families we have discovered effective methods to help trauma survivors. Our main method to assist anyone affected by trauma which changed our organization forever is called Rapid Resolution Therapy  (RRT). We have worked with children, parents, veterans, first responders and childhood abuse survivors with remarkable life changing results, as well as provided many therapy services for trauma patients in need. You can go here for more information on RRT...http://www.crisisreliefnetwork.org/programs.html
The combination of RRT and Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy (HBOT) for treatment of War Veteran patients with Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) and PTSD (Post Traumatic Stress Disorder) seems to be one of the BEST solutions to heal INVISIBLE WOUNDS like TBI and PTDS without having to many side effects like from heavy impact medications. 
Crisis Relief Network is approved as non-profit organization by the IRS as 501 (c)(3) tax exempt organization incorporated in Florida and is operating several division organizations under the same tax ID, like the Veterans Trauma Support Network and other sub organizations. All our divisions operate under the same umbrella of CRISIS RELIEF NETWORK. 



PLEASE HELP TO WIN THE BATTLE FOR BETTER VETERANS HEALTH CARE !


Support FREE Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy for Brain Injury Veterans...FINALLY the Answer to treating Wounded Warrior Brain Injury and PTSD Challenges ! 

Come and join our movement where we address the intense distress
our returning veteran’s experience. Many of these brave men and women have been
repeatedly exposed to traumatic events and life-threatening situations on
multiple deployments to combat zones and suffer Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder
(PTSD) and Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI). They return home to their families and
now have these health issues to deal with.
""There are many different treatments for veterans with PTSD and TBI
although research shows that many veterans drop out of traditional therapeutic
treatments because the process of recounting traumatic events is emotionally
taxing. They often fail to continue drug treatments due to the drugs side
effects along with the potential for addiction.""  (From the Mayoclinic)
Why we are here…


According to The Mayo Clinic (www.mayoclinic.org) the FDA approved
drugs for PTSD, such as anti-anxiety medication, can relieve severe anxiety and
related problems  for a short time, although because of the potential for
abuse, they are not usually taken long term. They also list the FDA approved
medications for insomnia and nightmares as well as approved antidepressants as
solutions. We feel in some situations drugs can be helpful short term. The goal
is to eventually be able to function without drugs and without the need for
prolonged psychotherapy, living as close to how our veteran’s felt before their
deployment in a natural state of calm and good health.

Many war veterans without hope for recovery are at risk for suicide. There is clearly an urgent need to provide alternate methods of
helping our returning veterans reclaim their lives and you can now help to
provide these veterans and their families with alternative relief based on the
study approved Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy, which is currently a way to heal
brain injury patients. 


Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy (HBOT) is unique to any other therapy
used for brain injuries and neurological conditions: It is the only therapy
known that can significantly raise the oxygen content in the brain and cause an
adaptation for repair and quicker recovery for TBI patients such as war
veterans. Neil Young of The Daily News wrote an article about Marine Corps. Lt.
Col. (RET) Alan Burghard, a bronze star and Purple Heart recipient, is quoted
as contributing his TBI improvement to Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy. It is stories
like this that bring hope to us in making this available to more veterans.


Medication affects cognitive abilities. When tissue is injured, it requires even more oxygen to survive. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy increases the amount of oxygen brain blood can carry. An increase in blood oxygen temporarily restores normal levels of blood gases and tissue function to promote healing and fight infection.
In a hyperbaric oxygen therapy room, the air pressure is raised up to three times higher than normal air pressure. Under these conditions, your lungs can gather up to three times more oxygen than would be possible breathing pure oxygen at normal air pressure.
Blood carries this oxygen throughout your body, stimulating the release of substances called growth factors and stem cells, which promote healing.
And so the brain gets a chance to heal and re-establish some of those processes.
                                       
FINALLY the Answer to Wounded Warrior Brain Injury and PTSD Challenges !
Neurological Injuries are conditions where the brain has developed
normally and then has had some type of trauma, whether it is physical such as
(TBI) or physiological such as a (stroke). One of the most important
applications has got to be immediate HBOT to help recover viable brain tissue
that is compromised and minimally functioning with low oxygen content. This
therapy has proven effectiveness and should now be considered as a primary
treatment option in conjunction with other primary treatments, but insurance
providers still don’t cover the costs for this treatment.

The evidence is overwhelming what the chamber has done for TBI. It is extremely unfortunate so far, that insurance does not cover this. 
""There are case history’s of people who were destined to be in a vegetative state for the rest of their life, that now are walking, talking, laughing and joking. They have a life. And – this is case after case after case.""                           Don Wood, Founder Veterans Trauma Support Network, Florida
At Hyperbaric clinics in the USA thousands of patients get helped with these ailments, some just needing moderate support and others who were in very acute or critical conditions. But the treatment is normally expensive.
""HBOT for veterans would save the federal government money, since it would no longer need to pay for pharmaceuticals for the rest of their lives. It's a disgrace how the United States mistreat our veterans. It makes me ashamed to call myself an American knowing that there is much, much more that we could & SHOULD be doing. It breaks my heart.""                                                                   From a licensed nurse  



FDA

HBOT was tested and further developed by the US military after World War I. Today, nearly every hospital owns a hyperbaric oxygen chamber. Most of these sit empty and unused!

The FDA has approved already several treatments based on HBOT, but
not for all kinds of diseases like cancer, multiple-sclerosis, TBI, etc.
 Therefore insurance providers still are not forced to pay for the more
expensive HBOT treatments.  Veterans are suffering in the mean time. Time
is of the essence with brain injuries, the longer they are left without
treatment the more suffering continues. The hope is that the FDA will at some
point in the near future accept HBOT and get it through the approval process.
There are many people working towards this goal, although again, many men and
women are suffering while the process unfolds.
HELP US TO BRING HBOT TO TBI AND PTSD WAR VETERANS RIGHT NOW !

SUPPORTERS OF HBOT
The White House has also recognized the importance of HBOT brain research as beneficial to the health of the men and women who fought in Iraq and Afghanistan. “The mental health challenges many of our troops face once they return home are very important” Michelle Obama said recently from a podium in Richmond, while launching a new program to help the troops coming home from war by supporting veterans with traumatic brain injuries.

is proceeding smoothly for the HBOT patient.
All of the patient’s treatment record will be filed appropriately,
validating the date of HBOT treatment, the protocol followed and the duration
of HBOT treatment. The partnership will also ensure, that all HBOT equipment
will be validated at delivery, verify testing, and to conduct appropriate
inspections, under international and national HBOT recognized protocols. 

How We Will Spend Your Contributions
All funds will help to acquire ONE Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy System to equip our medical facilitation partner with ONE HBOT Chamber. Expenses are planned for therapy readiness, operational expenses, HBOT System hardware and software and some office equipment. Also some interior improvement has to be conducted within the 3,000 square feet building. Total use of proceeds has added up to $55,000 to start operations and WE CAN START to provide FREE HBOT to TBI and PTSD veteran patients today !

Phase 2 Partnership
We are working also with other dedicated Medics in Florida to start operations and who want to engage with us and provide services to veterans for FREE HBOT, as soon as enough funds are available. We are planning to expand nationwide too, as many are in need of HBOT all over the country.

The Impact


So, whether you know about the
problem equation around HBOT from your profession, or you lost somebody, or you
know somebody who is facing currently acute challenges with urinary
catheterization, this is your call. 
If you support our cause, you
will really help and actually enable everybody within the healthcare community
to provide great relief and “Better
Standard of Care” for the many who are facing BI and PTSD on a daily basis,
plus you will be proud of yourself, as you are participating in one of the most
positive healthcare performance improvement changes of our decade. 
Your name will be associated
next to the ones, who’s name is associated with innovative value creation. We
see us as value provider and drivers of positive healthcare improvement, as
this is what our healthcare system needs most.
Your contribution will
allocate funding exactly where it is needed most. As time is of the essence, if
we do not treat BI and PTSD matters and fatal suicide rates in the right manner
with more adequate medical treatment, our society will continue to have serious
health care cost problems. Every dollar accounts!
Other Ways You Can Help
 The VETERANS TRAUMA SUPPORT NETWORK is bringing HBOT in front of the U.S. Congress. Please support also our PETITION to U.S. Congress...


We pledge that the FDA stops limiting treatment protocols that have not had reports of harming patients. Also to remove approval for drugs that have had reports of harming patients. Please FDA do your job right!
The recently approved bill in the Oklahoma Legislature will make hyperbaric oxygen therapy available for free to any Oklahoma veteran who has been diagnosed with traumatic brain injury and received a prescription for the treatment through the Oklahoma State University Center for Health Sciences. Senate Bill 1604 passed unanimously out of the Senate. It now heads to the House.
We are following this trend and have enacted a PETITION to U.S. Congress for mandating HBOT for TBI and PTSD as you can see below. You can sign up or follow our ongoing petition movement here below.

MAXFIELD - M.D., F.A.C.N.M.As member of the task force that has developed an international protocol for use of HBOT in acute stroke, Dr. Maxfield has a special interest in the use of HBOT for central nervous system diseases. He also initiated the use of HBOT for ataxia-telangectasia. Recently, Dr. Maxfield was also a member of the ethics task force in hyperbaric medicine.During his service with the navy, Dr. Maxfield worked on the development of many nuclear medicine procedures that are routine today, including more than 1,000 positron brain scans. As a member of the Plutonium Decontamination Team, Dr. Maxfield was introduced to hyperbaric chambers and the field of hyperbaric medicine.Upon becoming board certified by the American Board of Radiology in December 1961 with a medallion in Nuclear Medicine, he was promoted to Assistant Professor at Johns Hopkins.Dr. Maxfield is the author of 38 scientific publications, 2 short publications, 12 abstracts,  9 scientific exhibits and a video tape. His 45 years of clinical practice and research including 19 years of clinical hyperbaric medicine provide him a broad base of knowledge. His interest in clinical hyperbaric medicine resurfaced in the mid-1970’s when he searched for assistance for his father-in-law who had developed speech and balance problems. When four top neurological centers could provide no specific diagnosis or treatment, he took his father-in-law to Dr. Richard Neubauer’s center in Lauderdale-by-the-Sea, Florida, for hyperbaric oxygen treatment. The HBOT gave his father-in-law more than four years of independent life.Dr. Maxfield has extensive experience in treatment of stroke, multiple sclerosis, brain trauma, cerebral palsy and congenital problems such as ataxia-telangectasia as well as many other diseases that are treated with HBOT. Dr. Maxfield’s experience in imaging and hyperbaric medicine provide a unique background for his work in developing protocols to diagnose and treat conditions that may benefit from hyperbaric oxygen therapy.Dr. Maxfield comes from a pioneering medical family. He was born in Waco, Texas and grew up in Dallas, Texas, receiving a BA in psychology from Southern Methodist University. He was the fourth member of his family to receive an M.D. degree from Baylor University College of Medicine, Houston, Texas.Dr. Maxfield’s father James R. Maxfield Sr. M.D., in 1903, had the first x-ray unit in Texas for his practice of family and industrial medicine in Grand Saline, Texas. This was only seven years after Roentgen discovered the x-ray. His brothers, James R. Maxfield Jr., M.D. and Jack G.S. Maxfield M.D., were pioneers in the fields of nuclear medicine, radiation oncology, and clinical hyperbaric medicine.The Maxfield Clinic-Hospital in Dallas, Texas was one of the first institutions licensed by the Atomic Energy Commission to use radioactive isotopes in clinical medicine and research. In 1955,  the Maxfield Clinic-Hospital installed the third cobalt treatment unit in the USA. Dr. Maxfield and his brothers developed the techniques of treating bone metastasis with radioactive Phosphorus (P32) plus testosterone. They were also co-developers of the technique of implanting radioactive seeds encased in nylon tubes, a technique which is used increasingly today to treat various types of cancer. In 1978 a clinical hyperbaric oxygen therapy program was started at the Maxfield Clinic-Hospital.Dr. Maxfield and his brothers were founders of the American College of Hyperbaric Medicine and the American Board of Hyperbaric Medicine. Previously they founded the American College of Nuclear Medicine and were charter members and co-founders of the Southwestern Chapter of the Society of Nuclear Medicine. After serving as President of the American College of Nuclear Medicine, Dr. Maxfield was elected a Fellow of the American College of Nuclear Medicine.When he entered active duty with the US Navy in August 1956, he was assigned to the US Navy Hospital, Chelsea, Massachusetts to establish the hospital’s nuclear medicine laboratory because of his experience in nuclear medicine and radiology. He was then transferred to the US Navy Hospital in Bethesda, Maryland where he was chief of the Nuclear Medicine Section of the Department of Radiology and Instructor in Nuclear Medicine at the US Navy Medical School. While at Bethesda Navy Hospital, Dr. Maxfield was part of the USA delegation to the Second International Atoms for Peace Conference in Geneva, Switzerland.

By supporting Old Baby you are taking part in the creation of something unique, a film outside of the safety and conventions of mainstream movies that would might never have the chance to be made if it wasn’t for the direct support of fans. Supporting this project goes beyond just creating this film. It goes to expanding the types of movies that get to be made and expanding the audiences for those movies as well. I want you to support this project not only as the filmmaker but as a lover of the strange and weird movies that live in the borders of obscurity.

Back on the ground floor, the direct impact you will have with your contributions will be noticeable.

</div></div>","What is Old Baby?Tolikaan, NM:In the small New Mexico town of Tolikaan... ...the locals worship a strange folk hero they call “Old Baby.” 


America's Ancient Idols, a popular TV show dedicated to documenting and exploring the folk heroes and local legends that built America, sends a crew to explore and document this little known, but much adored, local folk hero.

As the crew digs deeper into the story of Old Baby and Tolikaan, they realize there is something unsettling about the town, the people, and the water. Old Baby might be something more sinister than they were expecting.





But it’s ok, it’s just a Movie… or is it?:
Old Baby is an unsettling mashup that flows in and out of a TV-style documentary set in a bizarre small-town run by a bumbling mayor, populated a plethora of local weirdos, strange customs, and an otherworldly occult nightmare like you have never seen - complete with a few commercial breaks from local chapters of the Church of the Black Nothingness, mattress stores, party lines for lonely people.
A little bit The Taking of Deborah Logan, a little bit Gummo, with a touch of Sam Raimi and John Carpenter - Old Baby will be a bizarre journey through absurdity and horror.  


Who would do such a thing?:
Hello, I am Adam Petke and I'm looking for help creating my next film, Old Baby.
I have a solid record of making highly innovative, quality, low-budget films. 
...Old Baby will be no exception.


Sandland: Summer’s Kiss (short 2010) 
An short film about a family coping with their lives in an existential void, created with miniatures and puppets:



-""Most Original” and “Best Production Design” UCLA Festival of New and creative works-“Best Animation” Shockfest,-“Third Place of Festival” and “Best Sound Design”  at LA New Wave-“Official Selection” Seattle Int. Film Festival- “Official Selection” New Filmmakers LA-“Official Selection” Lake Travis Film Festival 






Fat Rabbit (short 2014) 
A short film about a couple struggling with ascension to the great beyond when the creature they summon from the ground is less than they were expecting: 


-""Official Selection"" of H.P. Lovecraft Film Festival Los Angeles

-”Official Selection” of Best of the H.P. Lovecraft Film Festival Portland

-”Official Selection” of Fester: The Mindfuck Festival

-”Official Selection” of Los Angeles International Underground

-”Official Selection” of Another Hole in The Head

-”Official Selection” of Atlanta Underground Film Festival




Old Baby my second feature, the first being EXILE which was paid for out of pocket with production beginning in 2010. 

EXILE (feature 2014)

An isolated community has been controlled by an alien creature calling itself ""The Angel."" The children of this community reach an age where they must choose to become ""blessed"" like their parents, or ""fall"" and fend for themselves in the wastelands:
EXILE has been featured in a number of festivals.  It won “Audience Choice” at the 2014 H.P. Lovecraft Film Festival Portland (the first time in the festivals 19 years that the award had gone to a feature film) and “Best Feature” at Buried Alive Film Festival 2014. 

EXILE recently had its worldwide DVD and VOD release on April 7th, 2015 courtesy of Midnight Releasing.


This is what reviewers have to say about EXILE:

""Though crude and twisted EXILE is a fantastic little sci fi yarn juggling gore and horror with a skill I haven’t seen in a while."" - Ain't it Cool News 


""This film is a testament to how small funds do not have to equal cheap quality."" - Shattered Ravings


""Gruesome and thought provoking horror that was incredibly effective in all the best ways"" - LA Horror.com


“Exile is testament to the fact that good movies can be made with small budgets and  is one of the best indie horror movies we’ve seen this decade” – Indie Horror Central.

Outside of my own projects I have also worked as a Production Designer and Special Effects Artist bringing out the blood and fears on films such as Hazard Jack: 


Children of Sorrow starring Bill Oberst:

And the graphic Shock TIll you Drop Halloween special Short Film Candy:

This year I am more excited than ever for the opportunity to make Old Baby.

</div></div>","RECOUNT SOUTH KOREA TO ITALIANS MAKING A GUIDEBOOK WITH MANY BREATHTAKING CLIPS!

Hi all!

I'm a girl who loves Asian culture and philosopy, and I wish Italians knew something more about this beautiful reality!

But.. recently I made a shocking discovery... 


ITALY DON'T HAVE AN ITALIAN GUIDE ABOUT SOUTH KOREA!!!


We have guides for Japan, China, Philippine and others, but there is nothing about South Korea!!


This is a very annoying thing for asian addicted and also for Korea, that is not known in Italy.  It is not good!



Who am I:
I'm a almost-graduated psychology student, I have traveled a lot in my life and I made a lot of cross-cultural and anthropological researches thanks to my professors! I love Asian cultures, and I studied them a lot; This year I want to built a research about the school system in South Korea, and in this occasion I've noticed that Italy haven't an italian guidebook about this beautiful country.



My Purpose:

I want to make the FIRST ITALIAN GUIDE of South Korea in Italian language, and I want to present the beauty of South Korea with some breathtaking clips that will be included in the guidebook through cd or website, available by a password that will be findable in the book!


- The guidebook will be a mixture of indications for tourists , curiosities about events of cultural relevance and narrations of the beauty of cities and people (and their traditions/innovations). Italians are very sensitive to narrations, and for this the guidebook will be not only a tourist guide!

- Clips included in the guidebook will build a real documentary: clips will capture the beauties of towns and surrounding places followed by my personal presentation in italian language; I will partecipate to cultural events (like festivals, traditional weddings and others) and I will record the innovations of this country (I will try to visit Samsung and other big Korean industries); I also will present the most beautiful mountains and seaside of South Korea, and more.



At this stage:
 - I can no longer travel to make a complete and good work.

- I can't afford good translation services to have good comprension of the events I 
will recount.

- I can't rent the equipment for the clips (I want make this work professional).

With a positive outcome for this campaign:
here are the spendings that I will be able to afford:

- Travel around the country to present it in the way that I told.

- Rent the equipment for the clips.


- Pay translators and interpreters for the interviews conducted in Korean and for events.


- Plan post-production: editing, sound mixing and more.

The Team:
The team is not been presented becouse I will choose it directly in Korea, and this to not spending much in the moving (I will be alone on the airplane) and to have Korean view of visual arts! If you want to be a part of the team and if you live in South Korea, send an e-mail to universitystudent60@gmail.com , and we will talk about it! 
It can be a good chance for photographers, film makers and others to be known outside of South Korea!


What YOU Will Get:
Your donation will not be only a donation:



- With a little donation you can help two entire countries! And if you are from South Korea, you can help your business directly (sponsoring it) or indirectly (with a new kind of tourists that are informated on your country)!



- As you can see in perks, I will include you in the list of ""THANKS!"" in the final clip! Send an e-mail to universitystudent60@gmail.com after donation to have your place!


- As you can see in perks, I can make a photo of you (or, If you are too far away from me, you can send a photo to me) and I will include it in the final gallery called ""people"" or we can make the photo toghether and include it in the final gallery! Send an e-mail to universitystudent60@gmail.com after got a perk to have your place!

- As you can see in perks, I can make a photo to your restaurant or Hotel or Bar (or more) and include it in the final gallery that will called ""places"" with the address of the place! Send an e-mail to universitystudent60@gmail.com after donation to have your place!



If I will not reach the entire goal:
If I will not reach the entire goal or if the goal will be not sufficient, I will make single guides about main cities and their districts; I will decide it in the middle of work (in Korea), becouse I cannot know what I will spend to make a good job!
If after the goal will remain extra money I will donate them to an intercultural association where South Korea can be known by other countries! I will decide what association with you, in the group I built for this project!
If I will reach only few dollars in donation: I WILL NEVER GIVE UP! I will build other campaigns (part 2, part 3, part 4) relative to this mission, until I will be able of recount at least one or two main towns!

church has a thriving youth ministry, an effective rehab center for alcoholics
and drug addicts, a vital ministry to orphans, and 3 worship teams. 

We have weekly church cell-groups, where believers pray together and study the
Word of God together. Our church takes an active role in the social life of our city Kursk, holding  free events to help young
people to get involved in sports and so that they develop a healthy lifestyle
instead of turning to drugs or alcohol. 

We also hold festive Easter concerts
every year. For young people we conduct an educational program where we paint
the vision of Christian values for marriage and the family. By this, we are
able to reach out to people with the gospel of Jesus Christ. The official page of our youth ministry you can see here: https://vk.com/club80922479





Every summer we conduct summer Christian sport camp for teenagers. The official page of our summer camp you can see here: https://vk.com/shl_raduga
Our church also conducts the Bible School for children where kids start to study the Word of God.
We try to support orphans in orphanages. Our young leaders visit orphanages and organize performances for kids there. The official page of our orphanage ministry you can see here:  https://vk.com/club63418050

Evangelizing and spreading the Kingdom of God have always been top
priorities for us. Our church organizes missions trips and outreaches to the
various towns in our region. Our leaders that go on these trips, establish home
groups and train up new leaders in the faith. We also actively partner with
churches from other regions of Russia, the Ukraine, Belarus, and Poland to
help  organize international conferences.


We gladly accept missionaries from South Africa and India. Every year dear guests
from the USA (Houston Worship Centre) join us to hold “Revival Generation” conference. The official page of ""Revival Generation Kursk Conference"" you can see here: https://www.facebook.com/groups/1594467740800293/ 
We consider our
mission to be spiritual awakening among people and training up the next
generation of Christians.


The Lord is abundantly blessing the development of our church. 3 other
churches have been planted by our church. In spite of all this, we have never
had our own building to meet in and we have always had to rent different places
in the city to meet in. In the past 16 years we have met at 10 different
locations. But we have always had a clear vision of our mission of establishing
the Kingdom of God. Because of this, 8 years ago God blessed us with the
opportunity to obtain an unfinished municipal facility.


For the past 8 years we
have not been given permission to do some reconstruction work on the facility
to suit it for our church meetings. Now, the Lord has given us all the needed
permissions to finally proceed with the reconstruction work on the building.St. Peter's Church needs to have it's own building and that's why we
need to get our building done quickly so we can move in. We gathered enough of
our own finances to start the reconstruction process. In April we took a step
of faith, trusting in the Holy Spirit, and began reconstruction. 

However, for
the completion of our building we need your help.  We want to move into our new building by the
end of this year. To do that, we created this campaign. Dear brothers and
sisters, we will be genuinely grateful to you, if God impresses on your hearts
to help us in building His body in Kursk Russia through us. Every dollar that
you sow will work to establish the Kingdom of God, and it will bring forth
fruit!Latest news from our construction site you can find here: https://vk.com/club91582574",24.0,0,"2 Campaigns

</h3> <p>You would be hard-pressed to find a Mexican Martini outside of Austin, Texas. We are going to bring it to the playa for Burning Man 2015 and show you why an entire city is already going crazy over it. <i>Destination: Black Rock City, Nevada.</i> And, as a ""thank you"" perk for our donors, we have our nearest and dearest (and best kept) playa secret -- The Playa Passport.</p>
<p></p>
<p><br/></p>
<h3>What Is a Mexican Martini?</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1437839021/y6s4f5izqdifib9pk8rz.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Burning Man has a few bars. You can count them on two hands, but they're there. Actually, I might need a few more hands to count them on. Every bar on the playa has one thing in common -- one unifying trait -- not one of them serves a Mexican Martini.</p>
<p>El Paso started the margarita, and Dallas holds claim to the frozen margarita, but they've both been crying in a corner ever since the Mexican Martini opened shop in Austin. Restaurants and bars can either live or die based on the quality of this singular drink. True fact. So... <i>what is it?</i></p>
<p>You take tequila, Cointreau, olive juice, lime juice, a splash of orange juice, and some secret sauce, then you give them all a little dance party in a shaker. The shaker is part of the ritual. Once they're all danced out, you pour the mix into a salted martini glass that has olives in it with a lime on the rim. What you do <i>not</i> do is drink it. If you drink it, you're always going to want more of it. Save yourself that pain. It's the best drink on the planet and we're bringing it to Burning Man.</p>

Two Shots of Dust in a Desert )'(
 You would be hard-pressed to find a Mexican Martini outside of Austin, Texas. We are going to bring it to the playa for Burning Man 2015 and show you why an entire city is already going crazy over it. Destination: Black Rock City, Nevada. And, as a ""thank you"" perk for our donors, we have our nearest and dearest (and best kept) playa secret -- The Playa Passport.


What Is a Mexican Martini?

Burning Man has a few bars. You can count them on two hands, but they're there. Actually, I might need a few more hands to count them on. Every bar on the playa has one thing in common -- one unifying trait -- not one of them serves a Mexican Martini.
El Paso started the margarita, and Dallas holds claim to the frozen margarita, but they've both been crying in a corner ever since the Mexican Martini opened shop in Austin. Restaurants and bars can either live or die based on the quality of this singular drink. True fact. So... what is it?
You take tequila, Cointreau, olive juice, lime juice, a splash of orange juice, and some secret sauce, then you give them all a little dance party in a shaker. The shaker is part of the ritual. Once they're all danced out, you pour the mix into a salted martini glass that has olives in it with a lime on the rim. What you do not do is drink it. If you drink it, you're always going to want more of it. Save yourself that pain. It's the best drink on the planet and we're bringing it to Burning Man.
Know Your Terms:



The Original: The classic Mexican Martini cocktail, which we've been perfecting for more than a decade. If you don't tell us what kind you want, we'll make you an original.


Sweet: Extra Cointreau, often saltless or with sugar.


Briny: Extra olive juice and lime juice.


Muddy:  This is a playa-only Mexican Martini, as it will have a sprinkling of playa dust mixed into it.




What Is a Playa Passport?


May your passport live to be as dust-beaten as mine has. I love to travel and my favorite burners are also travelers. We collect passport stamps and stories along the way and it's a natural twin-spirit for burners.My sister Gaea bought us these notebooks in 2007, and we turned them into passports for the playa. Every sticker you get from a camp becomes another passport stamp to mark your journey. It's just large enough (5"" x 3.8125"") to hold all of your Burning Man tickets.  This year, we are going all out, with the ""Playa Passport"" stamp on the cover above the )'(, and our own ""immigration stamp"" on the inside with spaces to: paste/draw/duct tape your photo, write your playa name(s), write your camps and affiliations, and write down the years that you've burned. There's even a line to put your grand playa name -- as we prefer Jim Clark's ""Grand Playa"" term instead of using ""default world"".
There is plenty of space to write down when and where you'll be dancing, as well as the names of all your dusty lovelies that you meet out in the desert. It's become the first thing I get ready whenever prepping for Burning Man.
You can secure your playa passport as a ""thank you"" perk at the $40 donation level -- The Burner -- to be picked up ""on playa"". For shipping options, check out ""The Absentee"" donor.
10 are already reserved. That leaves only 290 of these -- which is about three or four theme camps. When they're gone, they're gone. Sorry.


The More You Know



Each playa passport is made from 100% post-consumer recycled materials, and is manufactured carbon-neutral with no chlorine processing. These are made in America; no sweatshops. Period. We've worked very closely with the manufacturers on the design. In proper Burning Man style, they're truly a work of art. We wouldn't have it any other way.


A portion of the proceeds from the project will be donated to St. Jude Children's Research Hospital via Amazon Smile.


Any unopened alcohol from the Mexican Martinis will be donated to DPW during Exodus. They build our city and they scour the dust after everyone's left. We love our DPW crews!


All materials used in the Mexican Martinis and Playa Passports will be reusable, compostable, or recyclable; no landfill.





What the Critics Are Saying

""I'm sorry, how did you get this number again?"" ~The Economist

""A playa what? Wait, who is this?"" ~The Washington Post

""No, this isn't Larry. No. No, you can't talk to him. I'm hanging up, I'm..."" ~BRC HQ


Other Ways You Can Help  
Share: Share, share, share. Please get the word out. Help spread the word with the share buttons above. It helps a lot!

Playa Bar Time Slots: So much mad thanks to The BuzzInn, who has already given us three time slots to start off with. We need four more time slots, preferably from two different bars. We will ID and bring all the supplies needed. It needs to be open to the public and with day slots available. We've reserved two playa passports for each bar that donates time slots. 
1 Spare Ticket: We are one ticket short at the moment. Hopefully that will be taken care of during the OMG Sale. However, anyone who has a spare ticket and can mail it to us, we have two playa passports set aside just for you and one heck of a huge playa hug to give you!   Our Stretch GoalsThis is our experimental year for both the Mexican Martini and the Playa Passport. Both have different stretch goals.Stretch Goals for Playa Passports: For all those who get a Playa Passort, we want your feedback. The first extra funds from the campaign will be going to next year's Playa Passports. Once you've loved them and used them, tell us what you think, and we will bring them back to Burning Man in 2016.Stretch Goals for Mexican Martinis: This was originally going to be the creation of an entire bar. However, our lead engineer is being put on a plane to Scotland. We are going to miss you Skybreak (and you, too, Ren)! If we reach an extra stretch of $2500 for the Playa Passport stretch goals, then we will save the remaining funds to invest in building the ""Two Shots of Dust"" bar in 2016.Fine Art for ""The (Wo)Man"" DonorsWe have ten slots open for ""The (Wo)Man"" donors. I am leading the project, and in the grand playa I am a world renowned and acclaimed fractal artist who appears on the covers of many books, buildings, and on album art (Daft Punk, not joking). For you, our top donors, I will be mailing you your choice from one of two fine art fractal prints (12in x 18in), in a jet black box frame, to be mailed post-burn. This beautiful fractal landscape will remind you of how you helped in 2015, and it comes with our incredible gratitude for your contribution.Of course, along with the fine art fractal landscape, you'll also get all the other perks of playa passports, passport stamps, and shaker passes. You are the best!Note: Art for the project was created by Jaya Prime and Alexandra from München.Note: The term ""cocktail"" should be in no way associated with shirtcocking.++: Bonus items marked with ++ are for entertainment purposes only.
