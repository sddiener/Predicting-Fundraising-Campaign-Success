HydroBot allows you to take the guesswork and hassle out of growing plants in water. HydroBot will seamlessly work with any hydroponics, fogponics, or aeroponics system.</p><p>Simply set it up once and start growing plants faster, that taste better. Monitor your system from anywhere in the world on any phone or computer. HydroBot comes fully assembled in a beautiful custom laser cut acrylic case with specially treated water resistant electronics. </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1570062014/hr7gpumupxylxbpmsurs.png"" src=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><i>HydroBot</i></p><p>What makes HydroBot amazing and unlike any device on the market is its ability to wirelessly control an unlimited number of hardware devices. Connect HydroBot to appliances such as air conditioners, fans, bubblers, dehumidifiers, or lights within a 200 ft range in just a few seconds without any wires. Combine this with its data logging, detailed reports, environmental sensors, and its ability to be controlled from anywhere in the world and you’ve got the most powerful hydroponics automation system ever built.</p><p>Even after taking into account all residential and commercial systems available, HydroBot is still the most powerful and cheapest system on the market.</p><div> </div><p><strong>HydroBot is a great investment</strong></p><p>HydroBot can realistically pay for itself in under 6 months. A system taking up less than 6 square feet can easily create over $100/month in value. In our example, we conservatively valued the harvest of leafy greens in one month at $1 per plant, in a  system with 108 plant sites. With plants that take about a month to harvest, you are producing a value of $648 in 6 months. However, leafy greens can retail anywhere from $1 to $5 per head or pound. If we value those plants at $5 each, you are producing $3240 of value in a 6 month period. The reality lies somewhere between these estimates and can vary depending on what you grow. In this example we're using leafy greens, but you can grow almost any kind of plants you want such as tomatoes, bell peppers, herbs, flowers, strawberries and a lot more! This investment not only benefits your wallet, but also the health of your family, your community and yourself.</p><p><strong>Great for both beginners and experts</strong></p><p>While HydroBot is designed to be beginner-friendly, it’s also great fun for veteran hydroponic growers! We’ve done lots of testing with different plants, in all kinds of conditions. It’s perfect for NFT (nutrient film technique), Bucket systems, DWC (deep water culture), and aeroponics (it is not designed for aquaponics). With normal use, HydroBot will last for many years (though probes may need to be replaced periodically).</p><p><strong>What can I grow? </strong></p><p><strong><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1570062126/qoowch1f489kfxqpq42u.png"" src=""""/></strong></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><i>Bell Peppers, Strawberries, Basil, Roses</i></p><p>You can grow almost any kind of plants you want! Commonly grown plants include: </p><p>Fruits &amp; Vegetables such as: Tomatoes, Bell Peppers, Artichokes, Beans, Lettuce, Spinach, Cabbage, Beets, Asparagus, Broccoli, Cauliflower, Brussels Sprouts, Peas, Eggplants.</p><p>Berries such as: Strawberries, Raspberries, Blueberries, Blackberries, Boysenberries, Loganberries.</p><p>Herbs such as: Basil, Catnip, Cannabis, Chives, Cilantro, Coriander, Dill, Fennel, Lavender, Mint, Oregano, Parsley, Rosemary, Sage, Tarragon, Thyme, Watercress.</p><p>Flowers such as: Amaryllis, Dahlias, Chrysanthemums, Iris, Freesia, Lily, Gerbera (Daisy), Roses, Orchids.</p><p><strong>How the HydroBot works</strong></p><p>HydroBot is built on top of two powerful mini computers. The RaspBerry Pi Zero and Arduino Lenardo. It runs Linux and controls appliances such as fans or lights wirelessly using dual 433Mhz omnidirectional antennas. It comes with highly sensitive air temperature, humidity, water temperature, pH (water acidity), and EC (water nutrient content) environmental sensors. It can even broadcast its own wireless intranet network for easy initial setup. It has tens of thousands of lines of custom software written by a developer with over 17 years of professional experience. On top of that, HydroBot's software can be updated, so it will continually get better over time!</p><p><strong>How we made HydroBot</strong></p><p>We've been hard at work for over a year working on HydroBot.</p><p>We started our idea project on paper. Then we built a rough model with electronics attached to a block of wood. The next version was built with relays and packed in a plastic container. Next we mocked up a CAD model of what it could look like. In this version we included 433 Mhz wireless radio to control outlets and fans controllers instead of using replays. We laser cut a beautiful acrylic case with the help of our local maker space - Building 61 at the Boulder, Colorado Public Library. Finally we reached the finished product.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1570062231/wublnrzmohhpnrwitqj0.png"" src=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><i>The different stages of HydroBot</i></p><p><strong>Features</strong></p><ul>

HydroBot allows you to take the guesswork and hassle out of growing plants in water. HydroBot will seamlessly work with any hydroponics, fogponics, or aeroponics system.Simply set it up once and start growing plants faster, that taste better. Monitor your system from anywhere in the world on any phone or computer. HydroBot comes fully assembled in a beautiful custom laser cut acrylic case with specially treated water resistant electronics. HydroBotWhat makes HydroBot amazing and unlike any device on the market is its ability to wirelessly control an unlimited number of hardware devices. Connect HydroBot to appliances such as air conditioners, fans, bubblers, dehumidifiers, or lights within a 200 ft range in just a few seconds without any wires. Combine this with its data logging, detailed reports, environmental sensors, and its ability to be controlled from anywhere in the world and you’ve got the most powerful hydroponics automation system ever built.Even after taking into account all residential and commercial systems available, HydroBot is still the most powerful and cheapest system on the market. HydroBot is a great investmentHydroBot can realistically pay for itself in under 6 months. A system taking up less than 6 square feet can easily create over $100/month in value. In our example, we conservatively valued the harvest of leafy greens in one month at $1 per plant, in a  system with 108 plant sites. With plants that take about a month to harvest, you are producing a value of $648 in 6 months. However, leafy greens can retail anywhere from $1 to $5 per head or pound. If we value those plants at $5 each, you are producing $3240 of value in a 6 month period. The reality lies somewhere between these estimates and can vary depending on what you grow. In this example we're using leafy greens, but you can grow almost any kind of plants you want such as tomatoes, bell peppers, herbs, flowers, strawberries and a lot more! This investment not only benefits your wallet, but also the health of your family, your community and yourself.Great for both beginners and expertsWhile HydroBot is designed to be beginner-friendly, it’s also great fun for veteran hydroponic growers! We’ve done lots of testing with different plants, in all kinds of conditions. It’s perfect for NFT (nutrient film technique), Bucket systems, DWC (deep water culture), and aeroponics (it is not designed for aquaponics). With normal use, HydroBot will last for many years (though probes may need to be replaced periodically).What can I grow? Bell Peppers, Strawberries, Basil, RosesYou can grow almost any kind of plants you want! Commonly grown plants include: Fruits & Vegetables such as: Tomatoes, Bell Peppers, Artichokes, Beans, Lettuce, Spinach, Cabbage, Beets, Asparagus, Broccoli, Cauliflower, Brussels Sprouts, Peas, Eggplants.Berries such as: Strawberries, Raspberries, Blueberries, Blackberries, Boysenberries, Loganberries.Herbs such as: Basil, Catnip, Cannabis, Chives, Cilantro, Coriander, Dill, Fennel, Lavender, Mint, Oregano, Parsley, Rosemary, Sage, Tarragon, Thyme, Watercress.Flowers such as: Amaryllis, Dahlias, Chrysanthemums, Iris, Freesia, Lily, Gerbera (Daisy), Roses, Orchids.How the HydroBot worksHydroBot is built on top of two powerful mini computers. The RaspBerry Pi Zero and Arduino Lenardo. It runs Linux and controls appliances such as fans or lights wirelessly using dual 433Mhz omnidirectional antennas. It comes with highly sensitive air temperature, humidity, water temperature, pH (water acidity), and EC (water nutrient content) environmental sensors. It can even broadcast its own wireless intranet network for easy initial setup. It has tens of thousands of lines of custom software written by a developer with over 17 years of professional experience. On top of that, HydroBot's software can be updated, so it will continually get better over time!How we made HydroBotWe've been hard at work for over a year working on HydroBot.We started our idea project on paper. Then we built a rough model with electronics attached to a block of wood. The next version was built with relays and packed in a plastic container. Next we mocked up a CAD model of what it could look like. In this version we included 433 Mhz wireless radio to control outlets and fans controllers instead of using replays. We laser cut a beautiful acrylic case with the help of our local maker space - Building 61 at the Boulder, Colorado Public Library. Finally we reached the finished product.The different stages of HydroBotFeatures

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Our plan is to build three demonstrator cargo drones at Prestwick in the West of Scotland, with our electronics and avionics development in Hampshire in South Central England.</p>
<p>Why three demonstrators? Because we need to prove the engineering of our design. Trust us, this isn't a walk in the park ... </p>
<ul>
<li>An engineering structures vehicle – part-build, non-operational</li>
<li>An avionics and electronics vehicle – part-build, test structure</li>
<li>A first flight vehicle, certified and enabling regulated initial missions.</li>
</ul>
<p>We need to raise £500,000 in total, and we are already some way there with our own investment, and a number of initial sponsors.</p>
<p>Yes, despite being a deadly serious technical project we’ve got perks.  </p>
<ul>
<li>Our Sky Hopper unmanned aerial system lends itself to great aerial art of missions. We’re giving away one of a series of prints showing the vehicle in action for every donation.</li>
<li>We’ve got CAD 3-d printing file types for modelling enthusiasts to make their own mini Sky Hopper. The ring wing cross-section configurations and the rear gimballing are flight critical sub-systems that are not easy to get right – we can help you make your own Sky Hopper tri-fan model.</li>
<li>We have some great competition prizes for our Air Livery design competition, Mission profile competition, and a technical drawing competition.</li>
<li>We’ve got an engagement program on the Sky Hopper electronic mission game with prizes for the best contributions to its design.</li>
<li>We have a special prize of an artwork created by Dugald Cameron OBE – formerly head of the Glasgow School of Art and the official artist of the Royal Air Force.</li>
</ul>
<p>Getting the engagement of a wider audience of enthusiasts is important to us. We want to show the world what British and Scottish technology can do – and do it better than anywhere else.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Why IT'S TIME ...</h3>
<p>We see Sky Hopper as a contributor to global development.  We know that small-scale survey drones are carving a niche for monitoring across many sectors.  However, they are - well - small with short mission durations.</p>
<p>Imagine a larger vehicle, with longer range and flexible mission capability designed around modularised automatic cargo delivery. We can move beyond merely monitoring and instead start doing really valuable things.</p>
<ul>
<li>Equipment parts take weeks to deliver in remote communities, we can deliver in hours. Water pump parts, electrical parts, replacement bearings, gears, valves and pinions, electric motor inverters, propellers, shafts and sealed glands. Sky Hopper can carry them all – fast - to site.  <br/> </li>
<li>Remote regions with inaccessible sites need all of the above and more. Sometimes exploration and development doesn’t happen because although you can walk in with a rucksack, you can’t carry a theodolite, a soil sampler, a seismometer, survey instruments or other equipment that needs to be left behind to collect long term data. Sky Hopper can bring them – right to the feet of the investigator.<br/> </li>
<li>Bad things happen in our world; floods famine and fighting. An early response and back up supply can save a lot of lives.  But it is often slow, and dangerous to provide what is needed.  Sky Hoppers can stream in resources to where they are needed, safely – supporting those in need.<br/> </li>
<li> Wide area monitoring can add value to the existing known value of small survey drones.  Imagine if rather than just surveying a small site, you could survey a region of dry grassland; looking for water, measuring vegetation, counting animals. That data is hugely valuable; it tells local communities how to make best use of their resources but also how to stay sustainable.  Sky Hopper technology can support and maintain our natural heritage by making good management of resources possible.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Developing a system like Sky Hopper is not easy.  It’s multi-faceted and needs a wide range of skills. Our team has a lot of experience, and we can also find, develop and manage others with valuable additional skills. But we also know the challenges. We’ve stripped our overall system design process down into steps; today, there are three main challenges.</p>
<p><strong>1. Communicating with unmanned aerial systems</strong>.  The key here is security within industry standards that are not yet fully formed. We can be a leader in developing these alongside our autonomous capability below. <br/> </p>
<p><strong>2. Developing enhanced autonomy while staying safe</strong>. Full autonomy is, today, a dream, but it is not ill-defined. There is a process by which test engineering can develop near-autonomy quite rapidly, which then has to be integrated with regulatory needs below.<br/> </p>
<p><strong>3. Proving to the regulators that we can do (i) and (ii)</strong>. In the world of UAVs (a term we prefer to drones) the regulators hold sway. We will start from day one on our certification, working with the regulators to get the civil aerospace community into co-operative mode and capable of satisfying the overarching need for secure, safe and fully capable systems.</p>
<p>We are convinced that these three hurdles are surmountable. There may be things that we do not know that we don’t know, but we are used to that. What is important about the steps above is that there is a professionally designed innovation process which can be worked through to achieve success.<br/><br/>That’s our USP – we think we have the team with the knowledge and capability who can do this. As you will see below it also means that we need your help.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Nobody know everything – and sometimes we don’t know what we don’t know. That’s why in industry something called the Division of Labour takes hold. People specialise in what they know best.</p>
<p>But during initial industrial development, and especially in modern technology, a wider systems approach is needed.  Sky Hopper is what is called a UAV system platform. Into that platform will be plugged a whole number of sub-systems, some of which today we know, others which will have to be discovered.  That’s where you come in.</p>
<ul>
<li>You might have skills that we don’t have.</li>
<li>And we’ve all got mates who know stuff.</li>
<li>But everyone has ideas, some crazy maybe, but often imaginative.</li>
</ul>
<p>What we want to do with our project is haul in as many people as we can to build a wide community of interest; on the engineering technology, on the electronic systems, on operational methods, on missions –commercial, environmental or humanitarian.</p>
<p>Sky Hopper is for all of us … but we can only carry the spanners if you help fund us. To find out more and engage go to <a href=""http://www.skyhopper.co.uk"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.skyhopper.co.uk</a></p>

Imagine a larger vehicle, with longer range and flexible mission capability designed around modularised automatic cargo delivery. We can move beyond merely monitoring and instead start doing really valuable things.

Equipment parts take weeks to deliver in remote communities, we can deliver in hours. Water pump parts, electrical parts, replacement bearings, gears, valves and pinions, electric motor inverters, propellers, shafts and sealed glands. Sky Hopper can carry them all – fast - to site.   
Remote regions with inaccessible sites need all of the above and more. Sometimes exploration and development doesn’t happen because although you can walk in with a rucksack, you can’t carry a theodolite, a soil sampler, a seismometer, survey instruments or other equipment that needs to be left behind to collect long term data. Sky Hopper can bring them – right to the feet of the investigator. 
Bad things happen in our world; floods famine and fighting. An early response and back up supply can save a lot of lives.  But it is often slow, and dangerous to provide what is needed.  Sky Hoppers can stream in resources to where they are needed, safely – supporting those in need. 
 Wide area monitoring can add value to the existing known value of small survey drones.  Imagine if rather than just surveying a small site, you could survey a region of dry grassland; looking for water, measuring vegetation, counting animals. That data is hugely valuable; it tells local communities how to make best use of their resources but also how to stay sustainable.  Sky Hopper technology can support and maintain our natural heritage by making good management of resources possible.


Risks & Challenges
Developing a system like Sky Hopper is not easy.  It’s multi-faceted and needs a wide range of skills. Our team has a lot of experience, and we can also find, develop and manage others with valuable additional skills. But we also know the challenges. We’ve stripped our overall system design process down into steps; today, there are three main challenges.
1. Communicating with unmanned aerial systems.  The key here is security within industry standards that are not yet fully formed. We can be a leader in developing these alongside our autonomous capability below.  
2. Developing enhanced autonomy while staying safe. Full autonomy is, today, a dream, but it is not ill-defined. There is a process by which test engineering can develop near-autonomy quite rapidly, which then has to be integrated with regulatory needs below. 
3. Proving to the regulators that we can do (i) and (ii). In the world of UAVs (a term we prefer to drones) the regulators hold sway. We will start from day one on our certification, working with the regulators to get the civil aerospace community into co-operative mode and capable of satisfying the overarching need for secure, safe and fully capable systems.
We are convinced that these three hurdles are surmountable. There may be things that we do not know that we don’t know, but we are used to that. What is important about the steps above is that there is a professionally designed innovation process which can be worked through to achieve success.That’s our USP – we think we have the team with the knowledge and capability who can do this. As you will see below it also means that we need your help.

Other Ways You Can Help
Nobody know everything – and sometimes we don’t know what we don’t know. That’s why in industry something called the Division of Labour takes hold. People specialise in what they know best.
But during initial industrial development, and especially in modern technology, a wider systems approach is needed.  Sky Hopper is what is called a UAV system platform. Into that platform will be plugged a whole number of sub-systems, some of which today we know, others which will have to be discovered.  That’s where you come in.

You might have skills that we don’t have.
And we’ve all got mates who know stuff.
But everyone has ideas, some crazy maybe, but often imaginative.

What we want to do with our project is haul in as many people as we can to build a wide community of interest; on the engineering technology, on the electronic systems, on operational methods, on missions –commercial, environmental or humanitarian.
Sky Hopper is for all of us … but we can only carry the spanners if you help fund us. To find out more and engage go to http://www.skyhopper.co.uk",0.0,1,"1 Campaign

Reduced load on the intestine minimizes the threat of Nozema and other infectious diseases.</p><p>Wintering and intensity of spring development are very dependent on the <strong>size of the colony and the state of its individuals</strong>. In autumn you can increase the size of the colony by feeding sugar syrup, but this usually impairs the ""quality"" of bees. Therefore, the best way to get a large colony is combining several smaller ones. With the first autumn frosts the bottom of UBB is overturned, and one chamber is installed on the top of the other of two chambers of adjacent bee colonies. Thus forming <strong>well prepared for wintering a large bee colony.</strong> In this case the bees do not conflict, form a common cluster and, usually in the spring, bees remove the weaker queen.</p><p>With this merger you can accommodate food stocks so that <strong>bee cluster and brood in spring were in the warmest area under the cover of the upper body</strong>.</p><p>The honey and beebread frames are placed in the lower chamber for spring development.</p><p>Thanks to the comfortable conditions, the bee colony in UBB during the winter is in a state of deep tranquility and <strong>the queen starts laying eggs later</strong>, usually after first flight.

Excellent protection against cold, noise, vibrations, oscillations of the magnetic field, excessive moisture, pests, birds, extreme outdoor temperature, sunlight and wind provide bees opportunity to be in deep dormancy (hibernation, calm) throughout the winter, while consuming a minimum amount of food. UBB also creates optimal conditions for spring development of bee colonies and prevents the brood from hypothermia and helps  defeating infectious diseases. Thus UBB contributes to survival bee colony even in those circumstances, where traditional methods do not work.</p><p> </p><p>               What (who) UBB fits best?</p><p>Most of all UBB suitable for honey bees:). If we consider the categories of beekeepers, the UBB is suitable for both amateur beekeeping and bee professional regardless of the direction of specialization. Indeed, the strong healthy bee colony is needed in any type of beekeeping.</p><p>Regarding climatic features, the UBB is indispensable in areas of high latitudes with prolonged cold period, and in the mountains and higher elevations of the continental climate. Good resistance and excellent protection against wind, noise are very much needed in the plain areas, as well as keeping bees in urban areas, including on rooftops or balconies.</p><p>Opportunities of the ventilation systems with heat recovery to protect the colonies during the winter of excess moisture will be very useful in areas with humid climate, sea coastal zones and in local valleys near rivers and reservoirs.</p><p>Reducing consumption of honey for heating and healthy bee colony with high immunity, as well as excellent service make UBB popular virtually anywhere you keep bees.</p><p> </p><p>                What are the disadvantages of UBB?</p><p>UBB is designed for maximum satisfaction of the needs of bees. But at the same time it is very convenient and technological for the beekeeper. In UBB used standard Langstroth frame and maintenance do not need any special equipment.</p><p>The main disadvantage of UBB is that large honey supers are twice as  heavy as conventional hives. Such supers could be removed and carried by two people. With a small number of hives honey harvesting could be done by taking frames separately.</p><p>Also, UBB can not guarantee the safety against bee poisoning, poor diet or infectious diseases and parasites.</p><p> </p><p>                How to deal with varroa mites in UBB?</p><p>By keeping bees in UBB, virtually all known methods could be used to combat the varroa mite. Through improved access to the brood chambers, the procedure of cutting out drone brood from the frame and installation of medications directly into the bee nest is greatly simplified.</p><p>Availability of bottom with mesh opening, what easily can be opened (closed), makes it possible to significantly increase the effectiveness of anti-mite medications, especially when using substances that evaporate easily.</p><p> </p><p>                Could wintering bees in UBB be achieved without installing</p><p>                  a ventilation systems with heat recovery?</p><p>The main ventilation in UBB is achieved through the opening in the bottom, the size of which is regulated by removing or installing separate segments in the bottom board. The opening is covered with metal grid and could be easily removed for cleaning, if necessary. Such ventilation in the presence of good insulation top of the hive (thermal cover) is usually sufficient and natural for bees, because they always cover with the propolis all the holes in the ceiling and side walls.</p><p>The ventilation system with heat recovery can be used for enhanced removal of excess moisture from the top of the nest without significant loss of thermal energy in areas with very damp climate.</p><p> </p><p>                Can components of UBB could be ordered  and used with available components?</p><p>Yes, of course. Because UBB used standard size Langstroth frames and standard thickness of wall board (20 mm), the majority of existing equipment can be used to combine UBB. Special attention should be paid to the size of the existing boxes (meter or inch standard and 8 or 10 frames).</p><p> </p><p>                 Does UBB have to be painted or protected any other way?</p><p>For protection from weathering it could be painted only the external walls of larger boxes and the bottom. All other surfaces, including exterior wall of brood chamber boxes which sit inside of the large boxes in the winter is impractical and not recommended to paint since  bees treat them with propolis. This provides protection from fungus and strengthens their impact on the nest microclimate (through the breath, steam and water permeability).</p><p> </p><p>                 What equipment of UBB is the best?</p><p>Choice of components of UBB and their number depends on the preferences of the beekeeper, applied beekeeping technology and conditions of nectar flow.</p><p>If the beekeeper is limited or in small amateur apiaries it is better using UBB with 8-frames brood chambers which have less weight. The system with 10-frames brood chambers better suited for  industrial beekeeping and high nectar flow.</p><p>Traditionally, deeper frames are used in brood chambers than in supers. However, if the honey is planed to harvest by individual frames, you can take supers with deep frames too. In this case all frames in the apiary will be the same size. Similarly only shallow frames can be in the apiary. Good insulation of brood chambers in cold period provides the ability for bees easily move between the chambers in winter and quickly evolve in spring.</p></div>","Main featuresDuring the cold period, Ukrainian Beehive Bjilnyk (UBB) provides unique protection of bees to a majority of threats and impacts.In winter and early spring, UBB gives for the bees nest a very good thermal conditions as above and on all sides are protected by two separate walls and a layer of air between them.Internal bodies additionally wrapped by insulated cloth, which keeps warm air around bees as well as in the hollow of a tree with very thick walls.As seen in infrared images, unlike conventional hives, in UBB virtually no heat loss is happening through the notch, vertical ventilation, as well as through thin walls. The bees consume significantly less food and are not worn out. And in early spring with a significant reduction of temperature, there is no danger of hypothermia and brood disease.As insulated cloth, it is best to use the material with a reflective surface of a thin layer of aluminum foil. This cover reduces heat losses not only by convection (air flow) but also by thermal emission (infrared waves). Also, such continuous cover of aluminum foil protects bee nest from fluctuations of the magnetic field. Some beekeepers offer to ground this protective shell by the thin copper wire.Bee nest in UBB is protected from the noise and stress much better than in other hives because the winter cluster is located behind two separate walls, between which there is no binding element. Therefore, wind, rain, hail, anthropogenic noise or birds (woodpeckers, titmice, etc.) do not violate the peace of bees. They eat much less food and are less worn out during the winter because each disturbance leads to the loss of additional energy and vitality. Vibration from transport or domestic machinery or even walking nearby the hive can disturb the bee cluster. But in UBB inner chambers in winter are set on two thin laths, which rest on the bottom only by their ends. Due to this, much of the vibration is absorbed. Also, it improves ventilation and moisture removal from the bottom of the nest.The bottom panel of UBB is composed of individual boards, some of them are not fixed. These, nonfixed segments of the bottom are very easy to pull out or insert from the sides of UBB regulating the size of the opening. This opening from the top or the bottom could be covered with shallow ventilation mesh or queen excluder. This allows adjustable ventilation in the winter or in summer migrations, protection from mice and birds, separation from fallen Varroa mites and waste or limitation of the bees from flying when pesticides are used in surrounding areas.In the winter to protect from excessive moisture, Ukrainian beehive Bjilnyk is equipped with a unique ventilation system with heat recovery.

Reduced load on the intestine minimizes the threat of Nozema and other infectious diseases.Wintering and intensity of spring development are very dependent on the size of the colony and the state of its individuals. In autumn you can increase the size of the colony by feeding sugar syrup, but this usually impairs the ""quality"" of bees. Therefore, the best way to get a large colony is combining several smaller ones. With the first autumn frosts the bottom of UBB is overturned, and one chamber is installed on the top of the other of two chambers of adjacent bee colonies. Thus forming well prepared for wintering a large bee colony. In this case the bees do not conflict, form a common cluster and, usually in the spring, bees remove the weaker queen.With this merger you can accommodate food stocks so that bee cluster and brood in spring were in the warmest area under the cover of the upper body.The honey and beebread frames are placed in the lower chamber for spring development.Thanks to the comfortable conditions, the bee colony in UBB during the winter is in a state of deep tranquility and the queen starts laying eggs later, usually after first flight. This reduces consumption of honey and preserves ""vitality"" of the winter bees. Also, this will significantly reduce the likelihood of hypothermia of brood and its infection (foulbrood, fungal diseases).Very often in the traditional hive during winter warming the spring sun warms the thin front wall and provokes the emergence of the early brood. Heating of the brood requires a lot of energy, and if cold returns, the family may die from the lack of food or diarrhea.In UBB, the insulated cloth creates the thermal cover around the nest, so the bee colony is developing very quickly and in the presence of food within six weeks after the first flight occupies both chambers. Good thermal conditions of UBB also contribute to better collection of spring nectar and pollen as more bees can switch from heating to the field work.Maintaining the high intensity of growth and preventing swarming, the nest could be expanded, used for packages or splits. If you need to split the colony, the bottom is overturned and two new small boxes with wax foundations are set next to each other. Above each of them are placed chambers with bees. In queenless colonies new queen or queen cells are added. After the lower boxes with foundations are build up, they are placed on the top. To collect nectar above them, queen excluders are placed on them and large expanded super is installed above.With the gradual development and occupation of this box, one colony with two queens is peacefully formed and adjusted of different sizes of colonies. The productivity of such united colony far exceeds the overall performance of two separate colonies!         Honey supers are placed one top as bee colony develops further.UBB allows an easy access to the brood chambers without removing the heavy honey supers. A beekeeper can easily lift common honey suppers with no help and set the thin bar or plank under. After fixing one of the sides of the honey supers by stretching or extra weight, the brood chambers on the opposite side can be easily removed and returned to the place. Thus beekeeper can check brood chambers, change their location, cut the drone brood or medicate brood area without the full dismantling of the hive.As one of the methods of removal of the bees for honey harvesting, the thin film is placed under honey super and their entrance openings are prolonged by tubes. The film can also be used to split the hive and for creating temporary antiswarming  nuc or future colonies. Beekeeper doesn't have to lift or carry heavy boxes. Also, this allows to avoid creation of defective nuc colonies without flying bees. By combining temporary anti-swarm nucs or a pair of big colonies, bees select the best queen themselves, i.e. the replacement of the queens taking place every year without significant problems.Like many other beehives in Ukraine, UBB has the bee entrances in two levels – at the bottom and in the supers. So during the harvesting periods bees can quickly put the nectar in the supers and it can be transformed into the honey much more easily. In summer evenings and nights the cold and dry air goes exactly into the supers, where it becomes warm and takes away water vapor, and then it is ejected  by wings of bees through the bottom entrance.Without bee entrance in the supers bee colony spends much more time and energy drying nectar, because fresh air must be warm and wetted by bees before contact with brood zone.In UBB the adjustable opening in big boxes can help to organize the additional ventilation in cold periods.The outer walls of big boxes and the bottom board are painted with durable paint to protect the beehive from damage. By request, they can be painted in traditional Ukrainian flower ornament or in any other desirable way.Overall UBB makes it possible to use almost all modern beekeeping techniques and virtually all available type of standard equipment. Smaller boxes can be made either on 8 or 10 standard frames and big honey supers accordingly 17 or 21 the same or lower height frames. Bjilnyk is more stable both in backyard beekeeping and for migrations, and in its production requires less wood than for typical hives.
For migration beekeeping migratory bottom and roof should be used. Dual migratory bottoms for two Bjilnyk (4 queens) could be loaded by typical fork lifters and stored in a several tiers and does not require a wooden pallets thus saving a space in trucks. Migratory bottom can be solid or screened. Joint bottoms and roofs of UBB are providing extremely high resistance in multilevel tiers of beehives during the transportation.
 
Ukrainian Beehive Bjilnyk is a very convenient for beekeepers and is an ideal shelter for bees throughout the annual cycle. It promotes and supports the sustainable immunity of the bee colonies and increases their survival in today's difficult conditions. Dimensions   About us We are a team of two beekeepers of Ukrainian origin.Iurii Dron, the scientist from Ukraine, Ph.D. in Biology, who started beekeeping 20 years ago. Although his grandfather was a beekeeper and had many hives, he had to start from scratch. Working in Chernivtsi National University, Ukraine, he’d researched soils. Beekeeping was only his hobby and pleasure of the weekends.Gradually, step by step, he increasingly immersed in the wonderful world of beekeeping, revealing more and more of its aspects. In 2009, based on 5-year experiments with bees and their housing, he decided to patent invented by him beehive. Work on improving its research really captured him and the results embodied today in a very practical and useful Ukrainian beehive Bjilnyk (UBB).Overall in beekeeping today, he possesses 5 patents in Ukraine and abroad, several scientific articles, the textbook. He is a member of COLOSS association and NGO ""Bukovynian beekeeper.""  Vadim Manzhos is a seasoned beekeeper with 30 years of experience in two countries - Ukraine and USA (Southern California and Montana) specializing in record high honey production from single hive working with many different types of hives and beekeeping technics including multiple queens in single hives. Why we are here Ukrainian beekeeping has several thousand years of history and lots of impressive achievements. Today these achievements can and should be used by apiarists around the world and help humanity in maintaining honeybee. In particular UBB, which is very convenient and useful for beekeepers and bees. It creates optimal conditions for bees throughout the annual cycle. This provides bees of sustainable natural immunity and high resistance against all threats. Thus, UBB significantly increases the vitality of bees and allows them to survive even in conditions where traditional methods do not work. Timeline 2004 - The first experiments with wintering bees by type ""body in the body"";2009 - application for 1st invention in Ukraine;2011 – 1st patent in Ukraine and 1st Article;2012 – 2nd patent in Ukraine and 2nd article;2013 – 3-rd patent in Ukraine and take part in 43 Congress Apimondia 2013, Kyiv;2015 – patent in Russia and report (thesis) on the 11th COLOSS Conference;2016 – applications for 4-rth patent in Ukraine;2017 –        January  –  international patent application;              July  - August –  crowdfunding campaign;         November    – sending UBB to backers. Risk and challenges 1. UBB creates comfortable conditions for bee colonies and allowing it to better withstand threats. However, it can not completely eliminate their negative impact. And no hive will help, if the bees have poor nutrition or their food gets lethal dose of pesticides. Also beekeeper should conduct an effective fight against pests of bees.2. Standard sizes of Langstroth hive are different in some countries. UBB will be produce in two standards - inch and meter. With each order becker has to clearly specify the desired standard and sizes he or she wants. FAQ             Why UBB promotes the survival of bees?UBB eliminates or minimizes the negative impact of factors that deplete the immune system of bees and cause of death, especially in the most difficult winter period. Excellent protection against cold, noise, vibrations, oscillations of the magnetic field, excessive moisture, pests, birds, extreme outdoor temperature, sunlight and wind provide bees opportunity to be in deep dormancy (hibernation, calm) throughout the winter, while consuming a minimum amount of food. UBB also creates optimal conditions for spring development of bee colonies and prevents the brood from hypothermia and helps  defeating infectious diseases. Thus UBB contributes to survival bee colony even in those circumstances, where traditional methods do not work.                What (who) UBB fits best?Most of all UBB suitable for honey bees:). If we consider the categories of beekeepers, the UBB is suitable for both amateur beekeeping and bee professional regardless of the direction of specialization. Indeed, the strong healthy bee colony is needed in any type of beekeeping.Regarding climatic features, the UBB is indispensable in areas of high latitudes with prolonged cold period, and in the mountains and higher elevations of the continental climate. Good resistance and excellent protection against wind, noise are very much needed in the plain areas, as well as keeping bees in urban areas, including on rooftops or balconies.Opportunities of the ventilation systems with heat recovery to protect the colonies during the winter of excess moisture will be very useful in areas with humid climate, sea coastal zones and in local valleys near rivers and reservoirs.Reducing consumption of honey for heating and healthy bee colony with high immunity, as well as excellent service make UBB popular virtually anywhere you keep bees.                 What are the disadvantages of UBB?UBB is designed for maximum satisfaction of the needs of bees. But at the same time it is very convenient and technological for the beekeeper. In UBB used standard Langstroth frame and maintenance do not need any special equipment.The main disadvantage of UBB is that large honey supers are twice as  heavy as conventional hives. Such supers could be removed and carried by two people. With a small number of hives honey harvesting could be done by taking frames separately.Also, UBB can not guarantee the safety against bee poisoning, poor diet or infectious diseases and parasites.                 How to deal with varroa mites in UBB?By keeping bees in UBB, virtually all known methods could be used to combat the varroa mite. Through improved access to the brood chambers, the procedure of cutting out drone brood from the frame and installation of medications directly into the bee nest is greatly simplified.Availability of bottom with mesh opening, what easily can be opened (closed), makes it possible to significantly increase the effectiveness of anti-mite medications, especially when using substances that evaporate easily.                 Could wintering bees in UBB be achieved without installing                  a ventilation systems with heat recovery?The main ventilation in UBB is achieved through the opening in the bottom, the size of which is regulated by removing or installing separate segments in the bottom board. The opening is covered with metal grid and could be easily removed for cleaning, if necessary. Such ventilation in the presence of good insulation top of the hive (thermal cover) is usually sufficient and natural for bees, because they always cover with the propolis all the holes in the ceiling and side walls.The ventilation system with heat recovery can be used for enhanced removal of excess moisture from the top of the nest without significant loss of thermal energy in areas with very damp climate.                 Can components of UBB could be ordered  and used with available components?Yes, of course. Because UBB used standard size Langstroth frames and standard thickness of wall board (20 mm), the majority of existing equipment can be used to combine UBB. Special attention should be paid to the size of the existing boxes (meter or inch standard and 8 or 10 frames).                  Does UBB have to be painted or protected any other way?For protection from weathering it could be painted only the external walls of larger boxes and the bottom. All other surfaces, including exterior wall of brood chamber boxes which sit inside of the large boxes in the winter is impractical and not recommended to paint since  bees treat them with propolis. This provides protection from fungus and strengthens their impact on the nest microclimate (through the breath, steam and water permeability).                  What equipment of UBB is the best?Choice of components of UBB and their number depends on the preferences of the beekeeper, applied beekeeping technology and conditions of nectar flow.If the beekeeper is limited or in small amateur apiaries it is better using UBB with 8-frames brood chambers which have less weight. The system with 10-frames brood chambers better suited for  industrial beekeeping and high nectar flow.Traditionally, deeper frames are used in brood chambers than in supers. However, if the honey is planed to harvest by individual frames, you can take supers with deep frames too. In this case all frames in the apiary will be the same size. Similarly only shallow frames can be in the apiary. Good insulation of brood chambers in cold period provides the ability for bees easily move between the chambers in winter and quickly evolve in spring.",16.0,0,"1 Campaign

No matter what’s going on. Also, because of its 100% weatherproof the Energy Cube is always ready to generate electricity even in the rain, downpour, and other extreme weather conditions. 

Solar Panel (1) provides power to the Signal Controller (2).

Signal Controller (2) distributes power between the Impulse Generator (3) and the Storage Battery (4). At the first launch, Controller starts the Generator, then feeds it with a small part of incoming solar energy or from UPS (6) when there is no solar activity.

Impulse Generator (3) amplifies incoming solar energy and charges Storage Battery (4).

Storage Battery (4) discharges thru Inverter (5).

Inverter (5) with peak load protection provides energy to the final Consumer (7) and charges Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS) (6) when required.

UPS (6) powers the Impulse Generator (3) thru the Signal Controller (2) when there is no solar activity or solar activity is low.
 In order to provide the possibility of generating high power combining with a small area of ​​the solar panel we improved existing and developed some new technologies. They are:    We have been developing and producing various devices since 2013. Our laboratory is equipped with mechanical, measuring and electronic tools, but the most important thing is our enthusiasm and desire to change the World for the better! Creating the Energy Cube we have already carried out multiple tests that proved the efficiency of the solar power amplification technology. That means battery’s charge-discharge cycle performance verified.Now we need to make a demonstration prototype in the body. This will allow us to select and configure the components to carry out the final tests and present the Energy Cube to investors to raise funds for mass production. All the donators will also receive priority in shipping (shipping order among thedonators will be determined by the amount of donation).Campaign Budget = components we need to make a demonstration prototype (plus INDIEGOGO and transactions fees):",39.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Who We Are</h3>
<p>Clean Sheets is the creation of United Biologics, Inc. (UBI), a Canadian environmental technology company focused on the development of innovative eco-friendly household products for everyday use.  We make it easy for people to choose everyday products that are friendly to the environment that we all share.  Our products are effective, easy to use, easy to store, and provide exceptional cleaning power and value for money</p>
<p>Our vision is to become the world standard for sustainable product development.  With this campaign, our goal is to raise money to get our first Clean Sheets order manufactured and delivered.  We believe our product is unique and will address three problematic issues associated with current laundry detergents - environmentally UN-friendly, difficult to store, messy to use.  Clean Sheets solves all three of these issues!</p>
<p>We are so close to being able to launch this revolutionary product and just need a little push to get there.  Once we can establish market acceptance, including from crowdfunding contributions, we will have access to many other funding alternatives with which to grow the business in Canada, and ultimately on a global basis.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need upward of $100,000 and currently have about $50,000 on hand so we are looking for an additional $50,000 from crowdfunding.</p>
<p>We have a bold new package design, strong branding, and a product that is more convenient and performs better than leading laundry powders and liquids.  However, the manufacturing equipment we need is very expensive and the production process is quite complex.  This funding will allow us to work with our manufacturing partners who, with our technical expertise, will be able to  manufacture the product on a contract basis.</p>
<p>If we don't reach our entire goal, we will still accomplish our objectives but it will take longer and we run the risk of large companies copying the design and claiming to be free of harmful chemicals even when they are not.</p>
<p>This is likely the first time you will have seen these thin laundry sheets, and from what people who have tried our samples tell us, you're going to love them.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>When consumers don't have to compromise on price, ease of use and performance, making a sustainable choice becomes a viable reality that will change the world.</p>
<p>UBI sees a future where its scientifically grounded, commercially viable, and environmentally-friendly formula becomes the world standard for innovation and product development.</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p><strong>Why</strong> are we doing this?</p>
<p>In this case it is simple. To accelerate South Africa's transition to sustainable energy. By doing this we will decrease South Africa's carbon footprint and increase employment. More on this below. </p>
<p>In South Africa there is only one energy utility named Eskom, which has a monopoly on the generation, transmission and sale of electricity in the country. According to US AID (<a href=""https://www.usaid.gov/powerafrica/south-africa"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.usaid.gov/powerafrica/south-africa</a>), 91% of energy generated by Eskom is from coal and according to Wikipedia Eskom alone emits 42% of South Africa's total greenhouse gasses!</p>
<p><i>The cost of pollution</i></p>
<p>In a Bloomberg article posted on 27 June 2019 they state: ""Eskom, which owns 12 coal-fired power plants in Mpumalanga province, in which the small village of Pullens Hope lies. The power plants are in a belt of 90 miles by 110 miles that accounts for most of South Africa’s electricity production. Air pollution in the biggest towns in Mpumalanga is regularly higher than that in Beijing and Jakarta, two of the most polluted cities in the world, according to AirVisual, an air-quality monitoring app."" It goes on to say: ""Pullens Hope has doomed Rita Phoku’s family, she says. For decades, she lived between a storage site for Eskom’s burnt-coal waste and a coal-mine complex. Four of her five children suffer from asthma and other respiratory illnesses, while her 23-year-old daughter, Prudence, died of cancer of the lungs and respiratory tract. Her sister, who lived nearby, suffered repeated miscarriages and died of respiratory illness. All told, Phoku says, she has lost as many as nine family members to respiratory-related diseases.""</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1591795472/kkenrjpitegnmglqkrgu.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p><i>Rita Phoku</i></p>
<p><i>The impact on unemployment</i></p>
<p>Since 2014 Eskom has not been able to generate enough electricity for the countries needs and SA has experienced what is known as ""Load Shedding"". Definition = ""action to reduce the load on something, especially the interruption of an electricity supply to avoid excessive load on the generating plant"". Basically they shut the power off for hours in certain areas to decrease the amount being used by the country in order to match it to the amount which they are able to produce at the time!</p>
<p>Renewable energy - especially solar and wind create more jobs than coal as per this Forbes article from 2019: ""Renewable Energy Job Boom Creates Economic Opportunity As Coal Industry Slumps""</p>
<p><i>Forbes on employment</i></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1591795572/uueapnmjja3btoy3ivoy.png"" src=""""/></p>

<p> </p>
<p>Fast Forward to 2020 and the private sector in SA is not allowed to produce and sell large enough quantities of electricity, which would make building large scale sustainable/renewable energy projects feasible and create large amounts of employment opportunities. </p>
<p>So to summarize the WHY - Raise public awareness about the benefits of sustainable energy not only on the environment, but also on unemployment. Whilst raising awareness ask the public to sign our petition to lawmakers to fast track sustainable energy policies.</p>
<p>This is where you come in. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What </strong>are we doing?</p>
<p>Raising the awareness of the public to the fact that South Africa has been slow on updating regulations to move South Africa's energy consumption to more sustainable energy sources. We will do this by providing information and facts to the public on the current situation on energy in the country and the benefits of sustainable energy for the environment and employment. They will sign a petition asking for the acceleration of policies and regulations on sustainable energy production. Link here: <a href=""http://chng.it/MwmNX4ksXs"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://chng.it/MwmNX4ksXs</a>. Now you may wonder, how are we going to get the public together in large numbers and interested in sustainable energy?</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>How </strong>are we doing it?</p>
<p>We thought long and hard about how to get people together and excited about sustainable and renewable energy. We needed something which would stand out, catch the eye and prick people's interest to come and engage with us. We will interact with them and share our passion for sustainable energy and the mission of accelerating South Africa's transition to sustainable energy.</p>
<p>It was decided that an out of the ordinary electric vehicle - the Tesla Model X - would be the perfect show stopper and attract a crowd. It catches the eye and has many features that normal vehicles do not have which people can play with and experience - thus getting them to engage with us and excited about the current electric technology out there in the world. It will also show people that going electric and renewable is ""cool"" and that the technology has advanced tremendously. Additionally when doing some research it appears that this will be the first ever Tesla vehicle in South Africa, which we will use as another way to garner people and the media's attention.</p>
<p>The plan then is simple. Import the Tesla Model X into South Africa and showcase it everywhere and anywhere with as much media attention as possible to spread the word. We will showcase it in all of the shopping centers across the country (South Africans love shopping centers), at the race tracks, at historical places, monuments, Table Mountain and perhaps even the Kruger National Park. Personally, we think a Tesla parked next to a lion in the Kruger could generate world wide media attention. </p>
<p>We will allow people to experience the vehicle and all of its features (for example: smart summon, playing racing games with the steering wheel and pedals, playing with the console and seeing the car dance), we will take people for drives in the vehicle and we will let some drive the vehicle themselves! We will be filming every test drive and every Ludicrous mode launch to see the reactions and faces of the unsuspecting members of the public! We will drive it across the country, filming people's reactions and us engaging with the public on the mission of accelerating sustainable energy in South Africa. Basically everywhere the vehicle goes it will draw a crowd and we will share the mission with them, sign the petition and record footage of the entire journey. History in the making.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Final </strong><b>Deliverables - How will we measure success</b></p>

<p><strong>Something else</strong></p>
<p>Electric vehicles in SA are non existent besides for a couple of BMWI8's and Jaguar I-Paces. On top of that these vehicles are expensive and thus most people in SA are not able to see or even test drive them nor are they widely promoted. Thus showcasing the Tesla Model X in shopping centers across South Africa, together with a road trip across the country should generate enough media attention and public interest - We are hoping - to open the eyes of the public which could lead to some pressure on government to decrease import duties on electric vehicles.</p>

<p>""And this is just the beginning. With Tesla building its most affordable car yet, Tesla continues to make products accessible and affordable to more and more people, ultimately accelerating the advent of clean transport and clean energy production. Electric cars, batteries, and renewable energy generation and storage already exist independently, but when combined, they become even more powerful – that’s the future we want.""</p>

<h3>Short Introduction &amp; Summary</h3>
<p>I am Ben Jordaan, a qualified CA(SA) - ICAEW equivalent in England and CPA equivalent in USA. I am passionate about Tesla and the future of renewable energy in the world. Actively trying to live a noble life and leave the world a better place when I'm done here. While making people smile in the process! Enjoy reading, working out, wine, cappuccinos, occasionally singing karaoke and dancing the night away. </p>
<p>I want to give you a glimpse into my thoughts on this campaign and the ""why"" behind it. Basically I have worked in corporate up until now, saved enough to sustain myself for a few years and have decided to do something I am passionate about and that also makes a difference in the world. I am passionate about (1) sustainable energy, (2) Tesla as an element of that and (3) doing good, whilst having a bit of fun and making people smile. Coincidentally these 3 things matched up with this idea and it has the potential to make a fundamental change in South Africa. Super Excited!</p>

We will showcase it in all of the shopping centers across the country (South Africans love shopping centers), at the race tracks, at historical places, monuments, Table Mountain and perhaps even the Kruger National Park. Personally, we think a Tesla parked next to a lion in the Kruger could generate world wide media attention. 
We will allow people to experience the vehicle and all of its features (for example: smart summon, playing racing games with the steering wheel and pedals, playing with the console and seeing the car dance), we will take people for drives in the vehicle and we will let some drive the vehicle themselves! We will be filming every test drive and every Ludicrous mode launch to see the reactions and faces of the unsuspecting members of the public! We will drive it across the country, filming people's reactions and us engaging with the public on the mission of accelerating sustainable energy in South Africa. Basically everywhere the vehicle goes it will draw a crowd and we will share the mission with them, sign the petition and record footage of the entire journey. History in the making.
 
Final Deliverables - How will we measure success

Successfully imported the first Tesla to South Africa
Showcased the vehicle at the V&A Waterfront in Cape Town and obtained at least 1000 signatures

Showcased the vehicle on national television
Thousands of personal shout outs to backers/accelerators
Awesome limited edition T-Shirts 
Presented the petition to minister of environmental affairs.
Created and shared a full video / mini series with all of you

YOUR PART OF THE MISSION
We have brainstormed creative ways for you to become part of this mission and created awesome perks of which some will last forever. Please refer to perks section of the website.
Your contribution will go directly towards accelerating South Africa's transition to sustainable energy by granting a person in South Africa the opportunity to experience the Tesla vehicle and engage with us. They will make a personalized shout out video thanking you personally for your part in the mission. One of the ultimate prizes is having your name inscribed on the Frunk (Front trunk) of the Model X forever, which will be showcased across the country during the cross country road trip. Thus ""you"" / your name will go everywhere with the vehicle!
We look forward to having you on the journey with us - making a positive and permanent change in the future of sustainable energy in South Africa and perhaps even the entire Africa.
""Be the change you want to see in the world"" - Mahatma Gandhi 
""Don't doubt your vibe"" - Elon Musk
 
ADDITIONAL DETAILS
Costs involved
The costs involved include those of purchasing the vehicle, shipping it to South Africa, insurance and any repairs and maintenance required. Legal fees for the petition and charging costs. Other costs include the creation of prizes and shipping thereof to accelerators. We will limit and potentially eliminate the costs of promotions and exhibitions in South Africa by engaging with shopping centers and race tracks, explaining the mission and getting them  to use the exhibitions to showcase their own commitment to the acceleration of sustainable and renewable energy in South Africa. Any over funding will help the team to continue raising awareness and putting pressure on government to fast track legislation. 
Timeline

Something else
Electric vehicles in SA are non existent besides for a couple of BMWI8's and Jaguar I-Paces. On top of that these vehicles are expensive and thus most people in SA are not able to see or even test drive them nor are they widely promoted. Thus showcasing the Tesla Model X in shopping centers across South Africa, together with a road trip across the country should generate enough media attention and public interest - We are hoping - to open the eyes of the public which could lead to some pressure on government to decrease import duties on electric vehicles.
From the Tesla Website - Link here: https://www.tesla.com/en_GB/about?redirect=no
""And this is just the beginning. With Tesla building its most affordable car yet, Tesla continues to make products accessible and affordable to more and more people, ultimately accelerating the advent of clean transport and clean energy production. Electric cars, batteries, and renewable energy generation and storage already exist independently, but when combined, they become even more powerful – that’s the future we want.""
 
Short Introduction & Summary
I am Ben Jordaan, a qualified CA(SA) - ICAEW equivalent in England and CPA equivalent in USA. I am passionate about Tesla and the future of renewable energy in the world. Actively trying to live a noble life and leave the world a better place when I'm done here. While making people smile in the process! Enjoy reading, working out, wine, cappuccinos, occasionally singing karaoke and dancing the night away. 
I want to give you a glimpse into my thoughts on this campaign and the ""why"" behind it. Basically I have worked in corporate up until now, saved enough to sustain myself for a few years and have decided to do something I am passionate about and that also makes a difference in the world. I am passionate about (1) sustainable energy, (2) Tesla as an element of that and (3) doing good, whilst having a bit of fun and making people smile. Coincidentally these 3 things matched up with this idea and it has the potential to make a fundamental change in South Africa. Super Excited!

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Honey bees are vital to life on Earth especially for humans. For years the depletion of honey bees was believed to be caused by herbicides and pesticides. Then it was determined the problem was actually caused by a Mite. ""Varroa mites remain the worlds most destructive honey bee killer"" according to the University of Florida. </p>
<p> Treatment for these mites is both expensive and arduous. Mite E Vape revolutionizes this treatment with the most affordable and effective solution ever invented. </p>
<p>From the Hobbyist to the largest Commercial operator. </p>
<ul>
<li>Chris Wood began his passion for beekeeping as a child. His father was a hobbyist with half a dozen bee hives. Chris was fascinated when his father would tend to the bees,  but his dad kept him at a safe distance so he wouldn't get stung, which only served to further Chris's interest. </li>
<li>As an adult, Chris began his own bee keeping operation in 2011,  even opening a store specific to selling his honey,  offering flavored honeys such as Habenero honey with candied lemon orange peels and Jalepeno Raspberry.  </li>
<li>This foray into beekeeping made the problem of the Varroa Mite front and center in the battle to save the bees. His first 4 hives seemed to be thriving then before he knew it, his bees were gone.  As a problem solver, Chris began to explore solutions to what he quickly learned was the Varroa Mite, with no acceptable solution to treat the hives. </li>
<li>Current technologies, though effective enough to result in a recent rise in the bee population, are expensive, minimally effective and/or cumbersome and typically price the hobbyist out of the market. </li>
<li>Your contribution stands to help put the honeybee population out of harms way and though this is a bold statement, possibly saving mankind! </li>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<ul>
<li>Your contribution will help  to refine the technology, making it easier to use, more effective and most importantly affordable. </li>
<li>Whether you pre order a Mite E Vape or just contribute to the cause, you will be making a HUGE difference. </li>
<li>Smaller donations will be rewarded with Mite E Vape Gear and Wearables, some of our World Famous Flavored Honey all the way up to Pre-ordering a Mite E Vape at a Special Discount.</li>
<li>As an Engineer, I am the soul source of income for my family.  I have a wonderful wife Robin, and three beautiful children, Eli, Ever and Edison.  At the end of every week, there is not much left over to bring the Mite E Vape to market. The funds will be used to secure our international patents, build our production quality prototype and begin production of Mite E Vape units to further our efforts to save the bees with my easy to use, affordable and effective Mite E Vape.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Believe it or not, Varroa Mites are so destructive, one week you check hives and they are thriving, a week later, the ENTIRE COLONY is GONE! This happened to me. I wasn't worried about the Varroa Mite, that was a problem for the big Commercial guys.  I had 4 hives as a hobbyist. I had checked the hives, I did notice a strange Brood Pattern but didn't think much of it. A week later, I checked my hives again and they were empty, I'D LOST ALL MY BEES!</p>
<ul>
<li>To start over was an expensive proposition. It costs over $100 for 3lbs of bees with a Queen per hive!  4 hives and I was looking at $400 and the prospect of the Mites returning!</li>
<li>There are strips and an inexpensive ""Fogger"" but they are minimally effective.</li>
<li>The Effective unit is THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS, cumbersome,  and not very user friendly.</li>
<li>As an Engineer, I knew there had to be an affordable way to deliver a solution. </li>
<li>Working evenings and weekends, Chris was able to fashion a unit that worked. </li>
<li>Lighter, easier to use, incredibly effective and only requiring power from an extension cord or a Power Inverter connected to your car, truck or buggy. </li>
<li>Plus, SO AFFORDABLE it makes sense for even a hobbyist to own one, current treatments cost $6-10 per hive per treatment, the Mite E Vape will reduce this cost to about $.25 per hive per treatment.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Chris has built and tested a prototype unit with incredible results, but more needs to be done!</p>
<ul>
<li>With this funding, we are engaging a company that takes prototypes and will engineer a unit that looks good, is easily manufacturable and affordable .</li>
<li>Once we can go into production, spreading the word about this amazing solution will be our biggest challenge.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Some people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean they can't help:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can help us spread the word! We need to reach EVERY BEEKEEPER ON THE PLANET!</li>
<li>The only bees that are not affected are Africanized Honeybees, but they are DANGEROUS!</li>
<li>IndieGoGo has awesome tools for you to share this life changing technology. </li>
<li>Gift a Mite E Vape to a beekeeper you know and love, trade them for HONEY!</li>

The vast majority of morel mushrooms are harvested in the Northern Hemisphere Spring. Wild morels are becoming increasingly rare in Australia as the climate changes and rain patterns shift.

<p><strong>Risks and challenges</strong><br/>This is our 4th crowdfunding campaign of solar gadget, through previous campaigns, we understand that backers bear risk with us and make a pledge, we know how hard to successfully handle with every part- including product design, manufacture , package, delivery, service.....even every piece of material we choose... Now SunPack product design is in the final stage, our current prototype is with function, but we need to make new molds and final moldfication, such as imporove the material quality of the stand and do more tests of the charging indicator, also bring SunPack to massive production. <br/>Some ricks and challenges are:</p>
<p>1. Shipping date: We have built in extra time for the manufacturing process and are confident we will ship by the projected dates, but there is always a chance that things will take longer than planned. <br/>2. Product changes: Slight changes may be made based on more product testing and kickstarter community feedback. We'll only make changes that enhance the product experience. <br/>3. Small components unexpected shortage can happen. In that case, we will inform you and do our best to solve the problem.</p>
<p>Please also feel free to let us know your concerns, we look forward to hearing from the Indiegogo community.Thank you for your support!</p>

Advanced solar technology with ETFE film coating+ integrated laminating +  dimple surface
1) Dimple surface does not reflect the light , captures more sunlight and increases 5% solar absorption rate. It offers excellent efficiency in terms of light to electricity conversion.
2) Non-adhesive surface properties. The dirt, dust and many other pollutants are less likely to contaminate the surface of panels. When this kind of contamination occurs, a damp cloth will typically remove these particles to avoid blocking sunlight from reaching the solar panel.  Also it`s stain-resistant .
3) ETFE film coating on the solar panel. A key benefit of ETFE (Ethylene Tetrafluoroethylene) coated solar panels is that they are super durable & lightweight. And the ETFE coating provides a thin 2mm layer of protection and UV resistant. It`s durable with long lifespan .

Now SunPack product design is in the final stage, our current prototype is with function, but we need to make new molds and final moldfication, such as imporove the material quality of the stand and do more tests of the charging indicator, also bring SunPack to massive production. Some ricks and challenges are:
1. Shipping date: We have built in extra time for the manufacturing process and are confident we will ship by the projected dates, but there is always a chance that things will take longer than planned. 2. Product changes: Slight changes may be made based on more product testing and kickstarter community feedback. We'll only make changes that enhance the product experience. 3. Small components unexpected shortage can happen. In that case, we will inform you and do our best to solve the problem.
Please also feel free to let us know your concerns, we look forward to hearing from the Indiegogo community.Thank you for your support!",43.0,3,"5 Campaigns

UpSens was born to take the use of a device that incorporated experiences gained in more than twenty years of R&amp;D and manufacturing activities.</p><p><strong>Where was UpSens designed?</strong></p><p>UpSens was designed and developed entirely within the UpSens team, in Trento (North of Italy). It is not an Arduino based hardware, but a completely new development, thanks to the skills gained in several years of experience in an Italian company that manufactures sensors or several industries, including aerospace and biomedical sectors.</p><p><strong>How is it made?</strong></p><p>The first prototype has been made using Rapid Prototyping and 3D printing technologies. In the production phase, we will produce a technopolymer case, produced by plastic injection molding.</p><p><strong>Who is UpSens made for?</strong></p><p>UpSens can help everyone! Currently there is an on-going increase in awareness and sensitivity towards environmental issues that will soon become an urgent matter; this means that measuring the quality of the environments where we spend most of our days will shortly become in need for ourselves and for all the people we care about.</p><p><strong>What I can do after the sensor measure?</strong></p><p>UpSens will give you an overview, it’s the first step: share your results, feelings and perceptions with our community. This will allow you to stay up-to-date regarding quality of life issues and solutions. Thanks to the community you may be supported in driving action to an improvement.</p><p><strong>Is UpSens an air purifier? Is UpSens an electrosmog reducer?</strong></p><p>No, it is not. UpSens is a monitoring sensor, able to measure the parameters. It will allow you to monitor and track environmental conditions around you. Thanks to this and to the community you will be able to put in place action to reach a better quality of life level.</p><p><strong>What are VOCs? And why is so important to measure them?</strong></p><p>VOC (Volatile Organic Compounds) are a mixture of gases, for the most part harmful to our health such as benzene, toluene or formaldehyde that may be present at home and in other buildings.  They come from common detergents, pesticides, flavoring fragrances, the paints off walls and glossy resin coating off the furniture. It is important to measure them because they create a wide range of effects ranging from sensory discomfort to severe alterations to our welfare.</p><p><strong>What CO is? And why is so important to measure it?</strong></p><p>Carbon monoxide (CO) is a colorless and odorless gas that is made whenever a fuel burns. Breathing carbon monoxide fumes does not allow oxygen to be used properly by the body and it also causes damage to the central nervous system. It is important to measure it because with excessive concentrations it can lead to death and being a gas that cannot be smelt or seen it is indispensable to have an instrument like UpSens to detect it especially in a home with wood burning stoves, fireplaces, etc.</p><p><strong>What will you do with the money you earn from the campaign?</strong></p><p>Crowdfunders’ money will be used only in the manufacturing phase and if we reach the goal it will allow us to reach a first step to economics of scale, something that an hardware like UpSens requires to stay in the market.</p><p><strong>When will the devices be sent?</strong></p><p>First in, first out: we will ship them in the same order of receiving the crowdfunding’s orders. Orders received in the first 48 hours of campaign will be delivered by the end of 2017, after this the deadline for when we will deliver is by March 2018 onwards.</p><p><strong>Will you ship worldwide?</strong></p><p>Yes, we will ship the items everywhere in the world.</p><p><strong>What will UpSens’ price be after the campaign?</strong></p><p>UpSens’ price after the campaign will be 227.00 USD</p><p><strong>Is UpSens under warranty?</strong></p><p>Yes, it's under a full 12-month warranty</p><p><strong>How can I contact you?</strong></p><p>You may reach out by e-mail at support@upsens.com we will be at your disposal for further info and data you may need.</p><p><strong>Does the sensor interfere with other electronic devices?</strong></p><p>No, it does not. It interacts with smartphone to allow you to download and manage data, then to share them with UpSens community on the dedicated Platform.</p><p><strong>Do I need to purchase all the sensors?</strong></p><p>No, you don’t. You can, of course but you need at least one sensor to monitor the parameter you need to measure.</p><p><strong>Can I connect UpSens’ base to devices I already own?</strong></p><p>No, you can’t. It works properly just with UpSens sensors</p><p><strong>Is there any limit to the number of connections I can make?</strong></p><p>Durability tests said you can connect and de-connect the sensors reaching 10,000 times</p><p><strong>Is UpSens safe?</strong></p><p>Yes, it is. It respects all safety standard required for this kind of device.</p><p><strong>How can I re-charge UpSens’ base?</strong></p><p>You can re-charge the base using USB bus, using the cable included (the same as most of smartphones on the market).</p><p><strong>Can I bring it with me in my pocket, bag, backpack or luggage?</strong></p><p>Yes, you can. It is portable and you may decide to keep it on or switch it off while put in them.</p><p><strong>Can I use it outdoor? </strong></p><p>Yes, you can. Operating temperature: 41°F - 104°F (5°C - 40°C), humidity below 90% RH</p><p><strong>Can I modify the internal hardware to connect more than one sensor? </strong></p><p>We kindly advise you to not do such actions, it will not work. The warranty will also expire as soon as you modify the hardware.</p><h3> </h3></div>","Introducing UpSens Did you know?

Researches conducted in Sweden by Orebo and Lund Universities say that a high percentage (1 on 12) of cavies during experiments developed either malignant cancer (brain and rare heart tumors) or precancerous lesions that can lead to cancer.Asian Pacific Journal of Cancer Prevention published research based on a meta-analysis of 18 studies, this meta-analysis suggests that EMF exposure may be associated with the increase risk of cancer.WAVE detects the electromagnetic radiation produced by electronic devices.You can use it at home or keep it on your desk at work to monitor the instant level of electro-smog or to measure the average value of the last 6 minutes. We set these two different options because an important factor is not to stay exposed for a long time to high electro-smog levels.We would like to give you a new lease of life, allowing you to avoid the impacts of electro-smog on your welfare. INDOOR AIR POLLUTION AND HEALTHHealth effects from indoor air pollutants may be experienced soon after exposure or possibly even years later. Immediate effects may show up after single exposure or repeated exposures. These include irritation of the eyes, nose, and throat, headaches, dizziness, and fatigue. Other health effects may show up either years after exposure has occurred or only after long or repeated periods of exposure. These effects, which include some respiratory diseases, heart disease, and cancer, can be severely debilitating or fatal.WE ALL TAKE AROUND 20,000 BREATHS EACH DAY: AIR QUALITY COUNTSAccording to a report (from UK’s Royal College of Physicians and the Royal College of Pediatrics and Child Health) as many as 99,000 deaths across Europe were caused by indoor air pollution in just one year. Indoor pollution sources that release gases or particles into the air are the primary cause of indoor air quality problems in Commercial buildings and homes. Inadequate ventilation can increase indoor pollutant levels High temperature and humidity levels can also increase concentrations of some pollutants.AIR traces the VOC, volatile organic compounds, that is harmful substances such as formaldehyde or carbon monoxide, benzene, as well as temperature and humidity. Some sources, such as building materials, furnishings, and products (like air fresheners), release pollutants continuously.A Study across Belgium, USA, UK and Switzerland evaluates even the human health risk from scented candles. Do you mind? Whenever we cook the VOC’s (Volatile Organic Compound) levels rise dramatically. Carbon monoxide (CO) intoxication is the leading cause of death due to poisoning in the United States, many victims of CO poisoning die or suffer permanent, severe neurological injury despite treatment. In addition, as many as 50% of those who recover consciousness and survive may experience varying degree of subtler but still disabling neuropsychiatric sequela.With the AIR sensor, we want you to monitor indoor air quality at home or at work. This measures VOC, CO, temperature and relative humidity levels.The touch screen LCD display will show you the results giving you an instant overview, which is easy to understand due to the different colors that will explain the air quality level. WE HAVE NO EXCUSES: IT WILL BE OUR FAULT!We need to protect ourselves and the people we care about, and we need to start this inside our homes, offices and cars.Here at UpSens we have developed a mobile app to give users the chance to share their measurements in real time, creating a map of the pollution levels in their neighborhood or city. They can also start discussions and petitions to actively change their local situation, without being influenced by authorities or other external entities.UNITED WE STAND: BE PART OF OUR ENVIRONMENTAL REVOLUTION THE UNIVERSAL BASE: IT’S EASY AS ONE, TWO, THREE.What makes our device extraordinary is that you can connect the base with the sensor you need to use; it will work properly with all the different sensors giving you full access to measure, monitor and track the results. THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS… A COMMUNITY WITHOUT A VISIONWe created UpSens with a big goal in mind: to start a revolution in the perception of a quality life. UpSens sensors will be instruments to allow this and we want our community to share the info and data monitored:
to set petitions to change pollution problems.
to visualize different data collected around your neighbourhood, state, country and the whole world.
to take part of a new way to enrich our daily life.
That’s the reason why we created an online space where our community can discuss, share and learn from other UpSensers. KNOWING IS THE FIRST STEP, BUT SHARING IS THE WAYWe strongly believe the power of our community. We want you to share your info, data and reports with the community. This will allow us to create not just a database of environmental issues, but also we want to create solutions, a database of smart ideas and to enrich ourselves with a higher quality of life.What We Need & What You GetWe have already collected about $196,000 in equity raising and about $120,000 in another fund raising. Thanks to these funds, we can now set a low target on Indiegogo: just $35,000.We’ll use this money to manufacture the WAVE and AIR sensors, which you can pre-order here.But we don’t want to stop there! We have other fantastic sensors, features and surprises that we want to produce for you! Therefore, we need help now more than ever!The more you contribute, the bigger the chance for us to achieve all our projects! You can engage with our perks to become more involved in what we are doing! Risks & ChallengeIf we don’t raise funds we will not be able to produce all of the other sensors we have planned. This will not affect the performance of the device as it is now, but we think it would be sad not to take advantage of its full potential.The feedback from the users will surely highlight challenges and demands which we will take on-board and we are sure that your feedback will lead us to improve our products. Other Ways You Can HelpIf you can't contribute, that doesn't mean you can't help us here at UpSens. If you like our project, please help us to reach more people.Please invite people to visit our Indiegogo page and use the Indiegogo share tools to spread our project!ONCE UPON A TIME THERE WAS JUST A CHARMING IDEAUpSens’ journey started As a result of many years experience in manufacturing B2B sensors. We designed, prototyped and produced many different sensors but there were no products designed to help us keep our homes safely monitored in an easy way; which we felt that had to change! Therefore, we decided to create UpSens! We decided to combine all of our expertise to help wider society.Since the beginning we set ourselves goals, which we have continuously met. Now we have set ourselves another milestone and we need your help to reach it!We are based in Trento, North of Italy, a place well known around the Country and in the rest of the world for its high levels of innovation, environmental protections policies and quality of life. We love to underline that from the very first step to the shop floor, everything is fully ‘Made in Italy’.Last but not least: using the Simone Simonelli design we put the Italian style all around our device, making it a smart instrument to keep at home. IT’S A GREAT IDEA AND STILL GOING STRONGWe have set different goals to be achieved for this campaign. With your help, we want to increase the device’s features and the number of sensors available. Every single action is another step to unlock a new milestone, contributing to our journey and to our vision. The more the campaign earns the more our product will help monitor our quality of life in many different areas. EVERY MISSION DESERVES SUPERHEROESA small team, with a strong know how, attitude and commitment to their job. We have many years of experience in this field and we have combined our different knowledges to take UpSens from an idea, to the shop floor and then into your homes! THE BEST IS YET TO COMELife is not a bowl of cherries, we understand this, however at UpSens we have decided to pluck up the courage and we have designed our future: this means more sensors and more pollutants to be monitored. The idea remains the same: to give you a chance to analyze and monitor the quality of your life. FAQs Where did the idea come from?The UpSens team have been involved for several years in Optoi, an Italian ""sensors company"" that develops and produces sensors exclusively for industrial, aerospace and biotechnological companies. UpSens was born to take the use of a device that incorporated experiences gained in more than twenty years of R&D and manufacturing activities.Where was UpSens designed?UpSens was designed and developed entirely within the UpSens team, in Trento (North of Italy). It is not an Arduino based hardware, but a completely new development, thanks to the skills gained in several years of experience in an Italian company that manufactures sensors or several industries, including aerospace and biomedical sectors.How is it made?The first prototype has been made using Rapid Prototyping and 3D printing technologies. In the production phase, we will produce a technopolymer case, produced by plastic injection molding.Who is UpSens made for?UpSens can help everyone! Currently there is an on-going increase in awareness and sensitivity towards environmental issues that will soon become an urgent matter; this means that measuring the quality of the environments where we spend most of our days will shortly become in need for ourselves and for all the people we care about.What I can do after the sensor measure?UpSens will give you an overview, it’s the first step: share your results, feelings and perceptions with our community. This will allow you to stay up-to-date regarding quality of life issues and solutions. Thanks to the community you may be supported in driving action to an improvement.Is UpSens an air purifier? Is UpSens an electrosmog reducer?No, it is not. UpSens is a monitoring sensor, able to measure the parameters. It will allow you to monitor and track environmental conditions around you. Thanks to this and to the community you will be able to put in place action to reach a better quality of life level.What are VOCs? And why is so important to measure them?VOC (Volatile Organic Compounds) are a mixture of gases, for the most part harmful to our health such as benzene, toluene or formaldehyde that may be present at home and in other buildings.  They come from common detergents, pesticides, flavoring fragrances, the paints off walls and glossy resin coating off the furniture. It is important to measure them because they create a wide range of effects ranging from sensory discomfort to severe alterations to our welfare.What CO is? And why is so important to measure it?Carbon monoxide (CO) is a colorless and odorless gas that is made whenever a fuel burns. Breathing carbon monoxide fumes does not allow oxygen to be used properly by the body and it also causes damage to the central nervous system. It is important to measure it because with excessive concentrations it can lead to death and being a gas that cannot be smelt or seen it is indispensable to have an instrument like UpSens to detect it especially in a home with wood burning stoves, fireplaces, etc.What will you do with the money you earn from the campaign?Crowdfunders’ money will be used only in the manufacturing phase and if we reach the goal it will allow us to reach a first step to economics of scale, something that an hardware like UpSens requires to stay in the market.When will the devices be sent?First in, first out: we will ship them in the same order of receiving the crowdfunding’s orders. Orders received in the first 48 hours of campaign will be delivered by the end of 2017, after this the deadline for when we will deliver is by March 2018 onwards.Will you ship worldwide?Yes, we will ship the items everywhere in the world.What will UpSens’ price be after the campaign?UpSens’ price after the campaign will be 227.00 USDIs UpSens under warranty?Yes, it's under a full 12-month warrantyHow can I contact you?You may reach out by e-mail at support@upsens.com we will be at your disposal for further info and data you may need.Does the sensor interfere with other electronic devices?No, it does not. It interacts with smartphone to allow you to download and manage data, then to share them with UpSens community on the dedicated Platform.Do I need to purchase all the sensors?No, you don’t. You can, of course but you need at least one sensor to monitor the parameter you need to measure.Can I connect UpSens’ base to devices I already own?No, you can’t. It works properly just with UpSens sensorsIs there any limit to the number of connections I can make?Durability tests said you can connect and de-connect the sensors reaching 10,000 timesIs UpSens safe?Yes, it is. It respects all safety standard required for this kind of device.How can I re-charge UpSens’ base?You can re-charge the base using USB bus, using the cable included (the same as most of smartphones on the market).Can I bring it with me in my pocket, bag, backpack or luggage?Yes, you can. It is portable and you may decide to keep it on or switch it off while put in them.Can I use it outdoor? Yes, you can. Operating temperature: 41°F - 104°F (5°C - 40°C), humidity below 90% RHCan I modify the internal hardware to connect more than one sensor? We kindly advise you to not do such actions, it will not work. The warranty will also expire as soon as you modify the hardware.",27.0,2,"1 Campaign

La superficie marina cumple una función fundamental para el planeta. Ésta refleja gran parte de la radiación solar hacia el espacio ayudando a que la temperatura global se mantenga estable. Al generar menos contaminación cuidamos de los espejos marinos.
Por un lado reducimos el uso de las plantas purificadoras logrando ahorrar mucha energía. Por otra parte el ahorro de 70 % de agua a su vez genera una eficiencia energética de hasta 300 % lo que te permitirá ahorrar energía que probablemente provenga de una fuente contaminante.
Ducheco es elaborado con material (ABS) reciclado.
En la mayoría de los casos el agua es obtenida de ríos y lagos donde sus ecosistemas se ven comprometidos por la continua perdida de agua, cambios en su temperatura y composición por la acción del hombre. También vertimos nuestros desechos en ellos.Por eso ¡cada litro cuenta!
Se descongestionan los sistemas de alcantarillado y se generan menos desechos los cuales son drenados al mar o al océano.
Si generamos menos emisiones de CO2, preservamos los ecosistemas involucrados,  conservamos los espejos marinos y cuidamos la naturaleza tenemos el extintor perfecto para el calentamiento global.

¿Como puedes ayudar y que obtienes a cambio?
Las recompensas las podrás encontrar en la parte superior en la columna derecha. Cada colaborador recibirá su recompensa si y solo si se llega al 100% del objetivo antes de finalizado el plazo para cumplirlo. De lo contrario, le sera devuelto el dinero íntegramente.Ducheco tampoco recibirá el dinero hasta 15 días después de alcanzar el plazo estipulado y cumplir la meta antes de dicho plazo.



Mi deseo y objetivo es que entre todos evitemos la contaminación de 100 millones de litros de agua diarios, 36.500 millones anualmente. Invito a todos a que tomemos conciencia y que actuemos...
Contemos juntos! empezando por mi:
 




Sin duda, esta es solo la punta del iceberg del equipo, muchas personas entre familiares y amigos son los principales colaboradores y promotores de Ducheco.
 

Recuerda que Ducheco no es la única forma de ayudar. Si no tienes la posibilidad de adquirirlo también puedes tomar medidas para evitar el desperdicio innecesario de agua recordando cerrar cualquier canilla, tomando un baño más corto y arreglando toda aquella pérdida que pueda existir. Y, si te a gustado la idea puedes compartirla en las redes sociales para que más personas se unan a nuestra causa.",27.0,1,"1 Campaign

How much water do I need?</b><br/>
    The water cell will need about two pounds of water in order to
properly work.</p>
<p><b>2. How frequently do I need to change the water?</b><br/>
    It is recommendable to change the water once a mounth.</p>
<p><b>3. Will it heat up during work?</b><br/>
    No. It is whatever true that any electrolytic process generate
heat. But due to the new and innovative approach and due to the electronic
circuit inside, in NG Water Re-Charger Pack the temperature will only raise
with two or three degree centigrade. On the outside this small increase will
not be at all noticeable.</p><p><font color=""#6a6a6a""></font></p><p></p><p><b>4.

When in use, and if the temperatures are only a
few degree centigrade below zero (like -3°C-5°C) the very small heat
produced by the electrolytic process will keep the generator working. If you
travel in areas with many degrees below zero (-15°C -20°C) then it is necessarily
to add and mix a few dozens grams (or about 15%) of pure alcohol in the water.</span></p><p><span></span></p><p><b>5. </b><span><b>How
many times will I be able to charge my Smart-Phone?</b><br/>
    If you'll use the NG Recharger only in the week-ends you will be
able to use it for about a year. If you will use it daily, you will be able to
use it for about two mounths. The electrolytic water cell and the 2800mAh
internal battery will easy be capable of fully recharge a normal smart phone at
least twice a day.</span></p><p><span></span></p><p><b>6. How many hours of light will deliver?</b><br/><span>

compatibility, restriction of hazardous substances compliance and electronic
security certification. </p><p>Second, is the mass production. Mass manufacturing isn’t the same thing as

Or even rainy water!The NG Energy Water Re-Charger Pack delivers to your phone, smart-phone, tablet or iPad a continuous supply of energy using nothing more then normal tap water as fuel.Just fill up the container of the NG Energy Water Re-Charger with about two pounds of water and immediately it will start generate energy and charge its internal battery.              It does not require salt water or any other special type of liquid to generate electricity. You can even use distilled water.How It Works?NG Water generator has a built-in 2800mAh li-ion rechargeable battery which is permanently charged and recharged by a water cell containing a range of electrodes made from a special metal alloy containing aluminum and copper, - 
In time some of these electrodes will be
consumed in the electrolytic process. If you
use the NG Water Recharger only in week-ends the water cell will work without
any problems for almost one full year.
- In a
very intense usage (like in a daily usage) the water cell will work without any
problem for more then a month. The replacement cost of the water cell will be about
15 USD, much cheaper then standard batteries.All in a compact size, stainless steel finishes:This new technology it's part of a patent registered at
""The State Office for Inventions and Trademarks"" - OSIM Bucharest Romania
- www.osim.roPatent
No.: R02013 00029 U1:The patent belongs to Mr. IONESCU IULIU; Head of Research and Development at NG Laboratories.What is the production plan?After finishing the tests we intend to begin the mass production. This
is why we need the found for. The vast majority of the fund raised here will
provide us with the possibility to start the production process. We already are
in the process of renting a 10000 square feets industrial space and we need to buy the
necessary production tools. If successfully funded, the first products will be produced in
the beginning of November 2014.Why IndieGoGo?Mainly because we want to keep our individual independence
and not be associated within a large corporation.We intend that the NG Water Re-Charger to be made for normal
people like you and me. All of us use smartphones and tablets 24/7 and we are
constantly connected. Our device allows you to stay in touch with friends and
families while you’re traveling, especially if you travel into very remote
areas where energy sources are scarce or completely missing.The compact and durable design allows you to slip it in your backpack or even a small bag for easy, hassle-free use.The Team:F.A.Q.:1. How much water do I need?
    The water cell will need about two pounds of water in order to
properly work.
2. How frequently do I need to change the water?
    It is recommendable to change the water once a mounth.
3. Will it heat up during work?
    No. It is whatever true that any electrolytic process generate
heat. But due to the new and innovative approach and due to the electronic
circuit inside, in NG Water Re-Charger Pack the temperature will only raise
with two or three degree centigrade. On the outside this small increase will
not be at all noticeable.4. Will it work in sub-zero temperatures?     Yes it will. When in use, and if the temperatures are only a
few degree centigrade below zero (like -3°C-5°C) the very small heat
produced by the electrolytic process will keep the generator working. If you
travel in areas with many degrees below zero (-15°C -20°C) then it is necessarily
to add and mix a few dozens grams (or about 15%) of pure alcohol in the water.5. How
many times will I be able to charge my Smart-Phone?
    If you'll use the NG Recharger only in the week-ends you will be
able to use it for about a year. If you will use it daily, you will be able to
use it for about two mounths. The electrolytic water cell and the 2800mAh
internal battery will easy be capable of fully recharge a normal smart phone at
least twice a day.6. How many hours of light will deliver? 
  If you intend to use it for lighting a room or a tent using the included
12 LED lamp, then it will generate enough power for the LED's to continuously
light for two months.7. What is the shelf life of the product?    The product comes with a 24 months warranty. If properly used,
the product will last for at least 5 to 8 years.8. Will there be future versions of NG Water ReCharger?    Yes. We intend to bring to the general public new and highly improved versions. We intend that in mid 2015 to put on the market a more powerful one, (but about the same sizes) for laptops.9. When will I get it?    We are sure that the first deliveries will start in the first week from November 2014. We are confident that all the pledges will be fulfilled by the end of this year.Risks and challengesFirst, is the
international certification. After our initial prototype testing, we will need
to send it to a certification organization for them to completely inspect our
product in order to comply with the EU, USA,
Canada
and other countries regulation. This inspection includes electromagnetic
compatibility, restriction of hazardous substances compliance and electronic
security certification. Second, is the mass production. Mass manufacturing isn’t the same thing as
building a prototype. We will need to prepare a standard operating procedure to
make sure mass production is efficiently building high-quality products.
However, due to our
experience and expertise we are very confident that all this challenges will be
successfully accomplished.We have been in development on this project for more than two years and with your help we believe we can deliver a product that people will love.",9.0,0,"1 Campaign

I have asked myself: What is one of the major factors limiting the people of developing world? They are limited in access to electricity, and by extension to communication. How can you educate yourself, or work, without light? How can you communicate without charging your phone – or even listen to radio news? Power grids are not there, or they are unreliable and expensive. <strong>This is what I aim to change with SolRing.</strong><br/>There are existing solutions – but they are <strong>expensive</strong>. People simply cannot afford them.</p><p>Yet a lot of people can obtain an old car battery – energy storage. Maybe they already have a solar panel. Cheap smartphones can be used to control the system via a simple app – designed so that anyone can operate it.

</ul><p>Thank you!</p><p>- The SolRing team</p></div>","The sparking idea for SolRing was thinking about how to improve the world in a real, measurable way. I have asked myself: What is one of the major factors limiting the people of developing world? They are limited in access to electricity, and by extension to communication. How can you educate yourself, or work, without light? How can you communicate without charging your phone – or even listen to radio news? Power grids are not there, or they are unreliable and expensive. This is what I aim to change with SolRing.There are existing solutions – but they are expensive. People simply cannot afford them.Yet a lot of people can obtain an old car battery – energy storage. Maybe they already have a solar panel. Cheap smartphones can be used to control the system via a simple app – designed so that anyone can operate it. SolRing unit is the brain needed to bind all these components to form a smart energy system – one that learns and predicts the consumption, so you will not accidentally run out of power in the evening before the sun rises again. KEY FEATURES OF SOLRING

Cheap: apart from the control unit, it uses readily available components

Smart: it learns from usage patterns and predicts charging cycles

Universality: prototype designed for solar, but future editions will allow any power source

Standard: no proprietary hardware connections

Easy to operate: simple smartphone app – via USB or remote access

Modular: see details below
Imagine how such a device could revolutionize the energy map – reducing or eliminatingdependence on power grids and dirty energy sources, so fighting against the global warming. It can improve the lives of millions of people – just by enabling them to have light, charge a phone or watch television, things we take for granted. It is also an excellent backup for a blackout. And off-grid areas anywhere: cottages, ships, mobile homes can benefit from SolRing, which will provide energy at lowest possible cost, in the most ecological way.MODULARITY OF SOLRINGThe roadmap for SolRing development plans adding modules as new features. There will bemodules for additional solar panels, expansion batteries, more power circuits, security cameras, fire detectors, wifi router. All these components will allow the user to build the system to suit their needs and to keep the cost as low as possible. What we need & what you getThis campaign is to raise the funds to make a prototype. The design was completed atDevelopment Laboratories of Czech Technical University which will also build the prototype on their state-of-the-art 3D printers. This is what we need your contribution for – to build a series of 10 testing prototypes. These are a necessary step before SolRing can enter production.Your contribution will not be lost if we don’t reach our goal. We are pursuing other means offinancing through grants and any other venue available – every bit helps us continue with theproject. We are really grateful for any contribution.Risks & Challenges
Lack of funding – prototype delayed or not built. We are pursuing all available financing means: government grants, private grants, venture capital investments. We are convinced that combining all this with crowdfunding will allow us to raise enough funds to build the prototype.

<p><strong>Campaign Summary</strong></p>
<p>For each contribution of $100 USD, you will receive one ECD 'Title of Ownership’ via our company e-mail.  With each ECD 'Title of Ownership', you are entitled to one (1) residential ECD device.  The Campaign funds will be used to pay office expenses, create a ‘Proof of Concept’, build a working Prototype, locate and contract companies to manufacture the device.  When manufacturing is complete, ECD Energy Corp will request that your ECD 'Title of Ownership’ be sent back to us in order to begin the redemption process.  Once the ECD 'Title of Ownership’ is received and validated by us, we will ship the device to your doorstep with instructions on how to install.</p>
<p>In other words, and for simplification, for what you might spend on a date night out, you will get a ECD 'Title of Ownership’ for a revolutionary energy device (worth approx. $3,000) which will not only change the world, but will provide you with enough clean free energy to operate a standard sized home for several generations.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Our Commitment to “WE THE PEOPLE”</strong></p>
<p>It took a while to take its form, but we have finally managed to find a fantastic solution to keep our device in the hands of “We the People” which will allow the common person to benefit from this magnificent technology. We view our invention as a true gift to the people that will revolutionize and set a new paradigm for the energy industry. One day, a miniaturized ECD device will power the hand-held smart phone or computer that you are reading this website on and it will never have to be charged.</p>
<p>Instead of drawing from institutional investors or venture capital and giving up full control of our great invention, we chose to take a different road to fund our start-up. Our solution is a reward-based crowd-funding campaign that will grant the “We the People” backers a right of ownership to the first residential energy devices manufactured.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>About the ECD residential device being offered as part of the campaign </strong>  <br/><br/>The reward-based residential device will be around the size of a standard home air-conditioning condenser unit (the unit that is on the outside of your house). It will provide enough electricity to power a standard 4,000 sqft home for your life-time and then some. This is possible because the electro-kinetic energy used to operate the device is estimated to last for around 400 years. No additional fuel or consumable resource is ever needed to power the device.

<p>Grow IQ is a smart and simple solution that allows indoor growers to spend minimal effort on growing plants while still maintaining high yields.</p>
<p>It is a modern horticulture LED light with smartphone app connectivity and control, scheduling, and monitoring; providing the first step in grow light automation. Growers will be able to use the mobile app to connect directly to the light. This allows control of the lights wirelessly while staying discreet on growing activity. Grow IQ also offers a proprietary scheduling method to help automate and simplify the growing process.</p>
<p>Even today’s advanced LED grow lights are still very basic in design and have to be managed manually, or with the use of an external device. Growers often have to either time the lighting cycle themselves (risky and time consuming) or rely on bulky and outdated timers to manage the light cycles. Controlling the lights is also manual with physical buttons/switches which may not always be easily accessible.</p>
<p>Grow IQ's advanced features address all these limitations while offering unique advantages that optimize the growing process and provide the grower with a peace of mind.</p>
</div><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1501297059/yzxbmbcoglfrngkfvcg0.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><h2> </h2><h3>Features</h3><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1501727009/wrwwuk9pirh3xffso7is.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: center;""> </p><div style=""font-family: 'Open Sans', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;font-size: 14px;line-height: 127%;"">
<p><strong>Effective and efficient:</strong> Grow IQ lights are designed to be suitable for both Chlorophyll A and B phases, and are safe to use during any stage of the plant’s growing cycle. Energy consumption is highly efficient and can save up to 75% of electricity compared to traditional lighting methods such as HPS.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1501278372/dachmzxxjlh3hcj9givh.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>Plant progress using the G100 light during actual testing.</i></p>
<p><strong>Smart:</strong> Grow IQ's  proprietary scheduling method offers a seamless workflow and will reduce a substantial amount of stress and effort in managing the light cycles for any stage of growth. The Grow IQ mobile app maintains private connection to the light and keeps the  grow light network stay discrete. Features of the light are fully configurable using the app and firmware upgrades can be done over the air. </p>
<p><strong>Stable and transparent:</strong> Our mobile app works with standard Wi-Fi protocol to assure compatibility and stability on different platforms, including iOS and Android. The connection to the box is extremely fast and reliable. You simply need to install the app, connect, and then control the light.</p>
<p><strong>Safe:</strong> The Grow IQ light is featured with a temperature monitoring sensor to prevent hazards in case of a malfunctioning system, or unexpected environmental changes. The system continuously monitors interior temperature, and will carry out an emergency power cutoff when it reaches an abnormal operating temperature. The grower can also always check the ambient temperature inside the light box wirelessly via the app.</p>
<p><strong>Dynamic:</strong> Every Grow IQ light can be linked to each other to form a network of lights that will be synchronized. This reduces the effort involved in managing multiple lights and ensuring they run exactly the same schedule. Grow IQ owners can also plug their legacy grow lights into the Grow IQ system, and it will handle the scheduling in synchrony. The scheduling system of the Grow IQ light was also designed to be power-outage sustainable; which means the schedule configuration will remain on time and counting in the event of a power outage. </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1501727756/mqbjuz7eap4vwcovk1ki.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><strong>Convenience:</strong> A gardener may be managing several independent grow rooms or tents at once, and each garden may be running a unique lighting schedule. Using the Grow IQ system, the gardener will not have to remember the schedule for each room or keep updated records of the running schedule for each. The gardener can avoid physical entering the garden in order to check the light status, and therefore will also avoid unwanted light pollution during dark periods that can jeopardize the crop. </p>
<p><strong>Slick and eco-friendly:</strong> The housing of the light is made of exotic solid wood, which was individually selected by our engineers. It is CNC precision cut, milled, and laser etched to ensure proper form and fit. The boxes are then hand finished, sealed, and polished to protect and display the natural grain of the wooden panels. The brushed Aluminum top and bottom covers further accentuate the natural look of the finished solid wood boxes.</p>

</div></div>","What is Grow IQ?
Grow IQ is a smart and simple solution that allows indoor growers to spend minimal effort on growing plants while still maintaining high yields.
It is a modern horticulture LED light with smartphone app connectivity and control, scheduling, and monitoring; providing the first step in grow light automation. Growers will be able to use the mobile app to connect directly to the light. This allows control of the lights wirelessly while staying discreet on growing activity. Grow IQ also offers a proprietary scheduling method to help automate and simplify the growing process.
Even today’s advanced LED grow lights are still very basic in design and have to be managed manually, or with the use of an external device. Growers often have to either time the lighting cycle themselves (risky and time consuming) or rely on bulky and outdated timers to manage the light cycles. Controlling the lights is also manual with physical buttons/switches which may not always be easily accessible.
Grow IQ's advanced features address all these limitations while offering unique advantages that optimize the growing process and provide the grower with a peace of mind.
 Features 
Effective and efficient: Grow IQ lights are designed to be suitable for both Chlorophyll A and B phases, and are safe to use during any stage of the plant’s growing cycle. Energy consumption is highly efficient and can save up to 75% of electricity compared to traditional lighting methods such as HPS.

Plant progress using the G100 light during actual testing.
Smart: Grow IQ's  proprietary scheduling method offers a seamless workflow and will reduce a substantial amount of stress and effort in managing the light cycles for any stage of growth. The Grow IQ mobile app maintains private connection to the light and keeps the  grow light network stay discrete. Features of the light are fully configurable using the app and firmware upgrades can be done over the air. 
Stable and transparent: Our mobile app works with standard Wi-Fi protocol to assure compatibility and stability on different platforms, including iOS and Android. The connection to the box is extremely fast and reliable. You simply need to install the app, connect, and then control the light.
Safe: The Grow IQ light is featured with a temperature monitoring sensor to prevent hazards in case of a malfunctioning system, or unexpected environmental changes. The system continuously monitors interior temperature, and will carry out an emergency power cutoff when it reaches an abnormal operating temperature. The grower can also always check the ambient temperature inside the light box wirelessly via the app.
Dynamic: Every Grow IQ light can be linked to each other to form a network of lights that will be synchronized. This reduces the effort involved in managing multiple lights and ensuring they run exactly the same schedule. Grow IQ owners can also plug their legacy grow lights into the Grow IQ system, and it will handle the scheduling in synchrony. The scheduling system of the Grow IQ light was also designed to be power-outage sustainable; which means the schedule configuration will remain on time and counting in the event of a power outage. 

Convenience: A gardener may be managing several independent grow rooms or tents at once, and each garden may be running a unique lighting schedule. Using the Grow IQ system, the gardener will not have to remember the schedule for each room or keep updated records of the running schedule for each. The gardener can avoid physical entering the garden in order to check the light status, and therefore will also avoid unwanted light pollution during dark periods that can jeopardize the crop. 
Slick and eco-friendly: The housing of the light is made of exotic solid wood, which was individually selected by our engineers. It is CNC precision cut, milled, and laser etched to ensure proper form and fit. The boxes are then hand finished, sealed, and polished to protect and display the natural grain of the wooden panels. The brushed Aluminum top and bottom covers further accentuate the natural look of the finished solid wood boxes.

<h2>About Monty</h2>
<p> </p>
<p>Monty bags are used to get rid of any unpleasant smells that have accumulated during everyday course of life. They are filled with the mineral which naturally absorbs the moisture and odours. There are no added flavourings that are often used by other odour removing products which simply mask off the unpleasant smell.  Monty bags' essential advantage is its compact size which makes it easy to use in your daily life: when your shoes get wet; or you want to remove unwanted smell from your sport equipment or even a fridge. Last but not least, Monty bag is reusable as you can simply dry it for a couple of hours once in a while and it will regain back all of its properties.</p>

<p>The history of the zeolites study began more than 300 years ago when scientists found first non-industrial scale accumulations of this mineral. The discovery of zeolites did not arouse strong interest due to the lack of applied value and they were forgotten for the next 200 years. Until in the mid-20th century, scientists faced the problem of water purification. Only then it became clear that zeolite is one the most valuable minerals in the industry. Today zeolites are often used in different aspects of everyday life from water purification to increasing productivity of agricultural crops by acting as a carrier of nutrients; and even being used as an eco-friendly alternative to phosphates in washing powders.</p>
<p>Today, natural zeolite has reached truly industrial scale and rightfully claims to be one of the most useful and sought-after minerals mined by natural means. An important advantage of the mineral over other absorbents is that it not only filters the water, but it also removes free radicals from it which negatively affect the state of healthy body cells.</p>
<p>In modern industry zeolites are indispensable in eliminating the effects of ecological disasters such as an oil spill. Due to their ion exchange properties minerals absorb a thin oil film and hold it in their structure like in a storage compartment.</p>

<p>Zeolite belongs to a group of microporous minerals also referred to as “molecular sieves”. These microporous solids are able to create so called “sieves” to filter out selected compounds based on their size thanks to zeolites’ consistent pore structure.</p>
<p>Zeolites are well known for its ion exchange property and being naturally stacked with negative charge particles.

<h2>Story</h2>
<p>Once a group of chemistry and biology students decided to arrange a week-long trip to the countryside staying in tents.  They found a wonderful place for camping, set up their tents and had long night talks by the fire. The night was warm and so were the conversations. As it was getting very late and everyone was exhausted after the earlier hike in the woods; students decided to wrap it up for the night and went to sleep leaving most of their hiking stuff outside. What nobody expected was the rain that took everyone by surprise and students found some of their belongings soaking wet the next morning.  By this time students were quite far from their home and this long-awaited trip was in jeopardy. Fortunately, one of the chemistry students had some mineral samples with him as he was using them as catalysts in his research. He knew that mineral possessed some adsorbent features and he decided it wouldn’t hurt to test its potential absorbing properties and put them inside the wet hiking shoes. While driving to the new place, the damp and unpleasant smell was eliminated. This student became a hero of that day.</p>
<p>After that successful experiment a great deal of work was done to create the optimal mineral combination and suitable packaging for this product. We are eager to help you solve these unpleasant everyday troubles and make your day a little less stressful and odourless.</p>
<p>In order to maximize the range of Monty's actions, we have perceived every person from our circle of friends as an expert who could help us improve the product by telling us about cases such as stench from guinea pig cage; dampness in a suitcase where a wet umbrella was mistakenly put; or just a smell from the boxing gloves that they were afraid to bring  home after an active workout in the gym.</p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>We are very exited to launch this project. We have been obsessing about Monty for a wile now so we had time to think about any potential problems that might occur. We are eager to start manufacturing immediately after the campaign and ship all the products in 2020. The only issue that still stands is a slight possibility of a delivery delay due to Covid-19. This is something that's hard to foresee, but we will do our very best to overcome any obstacles.</p>

Monty bags are used to get rid of any unpleasant smells that have accumulated during everyday course of life. They are filled with the mineral which naturally absorbs the moisture and odours. There are no added flavourings that are often used by other odour removing products which simply mask off the unpleasant smell.  Monty bags' essential advantage is its compact size which makes it easy to use in your daily life: when your shoes get wet; or you want to remove unwanted smell from your sport equipment or even a fridge. Last but not least, Monty bag is reusable as you can simply dry it for a couple of hours once in a while and it will regain back all of its properties.
 
Features





 
How and where to use Monty: 

 
Any shoes (sports, everyday use, children's, .....)

 
Any high intensity sports equipment


 
Alternative use cases are:

Smoking areas;
Cars;
Wardrobes;
Refrigerators;

Monty has a wide range of applications. This product is not focused on any particular segment of consumers. Almost everyone can use Monty bags in everyday life. Feel dampness in the bag where the wet swimsuit was left after a trip to the sea? Or there is a musty smell from the box with stuff stored in the attic? Wet children shoes after running around in puddles? Each of these problems for both kids and adults can be solved with the help of Monty.

Don’t waste your waste
 As we all know , many household waste have no way to dispose of food scrapes in a clean and sustainable way.This is a global problem.World Bank Report stresses that solid waste management is critical for sustainable,  healthy, and inclusive cities and communities,  yet it is often overlooked,  particularly in low-income countries.   While more than one-third of waste in high-income countries is recovered through recycling and composting,  only 4 percent of waste in low-income countries is recycled.Medior was founded a way to solve this problem that units natural composting and technology to turns your organic waste into compost. Say goodbye to garbage!Do you have any trouble in disposing waste? We take care of all of your organic wasteOur shredding system can deal with almost everything,  even small bones. Just one button , turns your waste into compostWe wanted to create a device to transform your waste convenient, fast and high efficiency.We also refer to other products,  other products create fertilizer --- by just dry heat and grind up waste or use biochemical enzymes decompose waste, maybe it will take a month , and you must look after them twice or three times a week.Medior have gone through several years of under scientific research and created a fully automatic technology and innovative.Only one button and 4 hours later you can get real compost.It will lead to a volume reduction of 50%-80%. Different foods may cause different volume reductions, such as vegetables such as cabbage will be reduced by 80%, but meat or seafood will be 50%.Medior combined  humidity and temperature wakes up the microorganisms and accelerates them metabolism.Medior reduces composting time from one month to only 4 hours.                                                                                                     How do Medior work?   The Advantages of MediorMedior transforms the majority of compounds in your food scraps like sugar,  starch,  and proteins.  These are broken down within 4h to fresh compost.Food waste dryers do only one thing:  shredding and drying food.  There is no biological decomposition process involved. You can see the graph blow about compared with other products. Organic waste in the worldA World bank report projects that the amount of solid waste we generate on earth will double by the year 2025.  If current trends continue,  we are likely to go from 3.5 million tons to 6 million tons per day by that point.If that’s not bad enough,  the figures predict that trash production will only keep growing for the foreseeable future.  It predicts we won’t hit peak garbage – global trash production at its highest and then leveling off – until sometime after 2100.  At that point, we will be producing 11 million tons of trash per day．Maybe you think our earth is the left one  that we have  bule sky, clean land, air, water ,  and also abundant natural resources,  but the truth is right one . Lots of garbage is created. Where there are people, there will be always waste.We have to think about what would it take to stop the garbage problem?Many local communities in the U.S.  have started to make residents pay for trash collection.  This does force people to find more creative solutions to divert trash that doesn’t have to end up in a landfill,  like  composting in their backyards. Facts About LandfillsAmericans throw out almost 40% of their food in landfills.One Arizona landfill study found,  among other things,  “still-recognizable 25-year-old hot dogs,  corncobs and grapes in landfills.This is the equivalent of 20 lbs of food,  per person,  per month Or $165 Billion per year.Benefits of CompostingBy contrast,  if you turn your waste into compost,  you will:Give your plants macro and micronutrients they may be missing from soil that has become depleted.Help the soil itself absorb and hold water and nutrients.Feed a variety of earthworms, beetles,  ants and other bugs,  which do amazing things for the soil and in turn bring a host of micronutrients back to your own table,  if you’re growing your own vegetables.Improve the PH balance of the soil.Add beneficial bacteria and fungi to the soil.Treating organic waste also reduces waste disposal costs,  and leads to cleaner recyclables,  as well as avoiding greenhouse gas emissions.  As waste management is usually within the power of cities,  cities can often implement food and organics waste schemes quickly. What is included with Medior?                            We ship many locations,  we will provide a  plug what you need.  You can check the graph blow and tell us which type do you need. Details USE COMPOST IN MANY WAYSGive your plants or vegetables a green booster. Timeline Production toolingOur manufacturing tooling is ready and we our own factory.We have did test production in 2020 and we have a lot of experience on our factory.We will delivery in June, 2021.

We have had enough of irresponsible corporations and countries with governments playing around with purely symbolic energy polices and who still subsidize fossil fuels. Including our own. The climate change is real and it's far worse than the most of us understand.The relentless rise of CO2 emissions has to stop and it has to stop immediately. We are stealing our children’s future right in front of their eyes.When the world’s leaders don’t act, someone else have to. Our Mission Our long-term goal is to be one of the biggest private solar power producers in Sweden and in the Nordic region. The short-term goal is to get the Project One up and running. Once we start delivering energy, we can expand the solar parks exponentially. The Reality of TodayWe have barley left 2018 behind us and it was the worst year of all time. The carbon emissions increased by 2 % and we polluted our planet with more than 45 billion metric tons of CO2, in one single year. That number was 9,2 billion tons only 60 years ago, making it an almost 500 % increase.By using fossil fuels and dumping the CO2 in the atmosphere we are running the most dangerous experiment of all time. Planet earth and everything beautiful about it are slowly dying from the pollutions and global warming, literally. Hurricanes, wildfires, ice melting, islands disappearing, extreme drought, heat waves, floods, oil disasters. This is consequenses we're already suffering from. And it will get worse.  The most powerful country in the world, USA, left the Paris agreement and president Trump even denies that the climate changes has anything to do with greenhouse gases. Chinas emissions, the world’s largest emitter, are projected to keep rising until at least 2030. This is sending all the wrong signals to the rest of the world and the big corporations. If the biggest and most powerful doesn’t do something about it, why should we…?  It simply isn’t good enough.  What We FaceThe climate and weather highly correlate with the global warming. The summers gets warmer, the winters gets colder and more servere, the hurricanes get worse and more frequent. Floods, droughts and wildfires are things we will be forced to deal with more often. The polar ice are melting and the sea level rises. Millions of people will lose their homes, starve to death and animal species will be extinguished. Our children and future generations won't have a pleasant future if this keeps going on.   In 2014 the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) projected the sea level to rise 90 cm (2 ft) before 2099. New studies show that a global sea level rise of 200 – 270 cm (6,5 – 9 ft) is physically plausible in the same time span. Why is so few doing anything about this? Millions of people will lose their homes. Islands and cities will disappear. Project OneProject One will be located in the southernmost part of Sweden.

<p>Almost 70 years ago Prof John Roy Robert Searl (Prof Searl) invented a new process for generating energy using a device about the size of a small coffee table.  It requires no gas, coal or oil and radiates no heat.  It's called the Spatial Effect Generator (SEG), or by its original name the Searl Effect Generator.</p>
<p>Q: If it was invented so long ago why is it not everywhere already?</p>
<p>A: For approximately 55 years Prof Searl struggled on his own to understand and explain the SEG.  He faced many critics with opposing views because he could not describe exactly how it worked on an atomic level.  And investors are notorious for hanging onto their money when inventions are not fully understood.  Fortunately, time and scientific understanding have marched on, and with the help of a lot of brilliant people, we have a much deeper understanding of the process now.</p>
<p>SEG Magnetics, Inc. (SMI) and its members are forging ahead but we are at a critical stage in our magnetization process. We have designed and partially constructed the high-powered systems needed to magnetize the larger magnetic components.  Unfortunately, this stage of the research is very expensive and time-consuming.  But when complete it will allow us to replicate the SEG for the first time since it was originally conceived back in the 1950s.</p>

<p>Q:  What could this technology do for the world?</p>
<p>A:  It hardly needs to be described but have you ever run out of gas or experienced a power outage before?  As distressing and inconvenient as these situations may be they pale in comparison to the issues impoverished, third world, war-torn or far northern regions of our world face every day.</p>
<p>Remember what it was like the day after the Indian Ocean tsunami in 2004 or the 2011 tsunami in Japan?  Could more lives have been saved if every water source, hospital, civil service and heavy lift vehicle ran on a SEG?</p>
<p>Right now (July 2017) there are 22.5 million refugees dispersed around the world and most are in camps with little or no power at all. Schools, hospitals, and countless other basic human services are simply not possible because of a lack of access to power.</p>

<p>I am sure you are thinking this should be easy to find investors for, but this project is special. In recent years extremely wealthy individuals and organizations have attempted to secure ownership of this technology for their own reasons. Some simply see it as a way to accumulate more wealth and would have no problem selling off their shares to the highest bidder.  Others want to see it locked away and forgotten because it will compete directly with their investments in other energy technologies. We think there is room for many different sources of energy in the world. Gas, coal, and oil have many other uses and are not going anywhere for a very long time.  But are you willing to risk leaving control of this device in their hands?</p>

<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Bamboo Paper Saves Trees!</strong></p>
<p>Did you know it can take 24 fully grown trees to make just one ton of paper, which is only 400 reams of A4 paper! Imagine how many trees are sacrificed every day to meet our paper needs worldwide. Now consider bamboo, a member of the grass family which can grow up to 10 times faster than wood. Due to its many environmental advantages over wood, bamboo paper is <strong>100% Tree-Free &amp; Eco-Friendly</strong> - <strong>Acid-Free</strong> &amp; <strong>Carbon Neutral</strong> &amp; <strong>Chlorine-Free</strong>!</p>

<h3>1. Bamboo vs Deforestation! Bamboo is a superhero in the fight against deforestation!</h3>
<p>Bamboo has an extremely low environmental impact compared with the harvesting destruction of soft wood forests which results in high impact to birds and animals, and causes extensive land scarring. When it is harvested, it will grow a new shoot from its extensive root system with no need for additional planting or cultivation. Depending on the species, bamboo can be harvested in one to five years. Hardwoods like oak take at least forty years to mature before they can be harvested. Almost 1 million acres of forests are lost each week worldwide to deforestation. <strong>Bamboo's versatility</strong> as a substitute for hardwoods <strong>offers a chance</strong> to drastically reduce that figure and <strong>protect the forests</strong> that we have left. And Yes! Bamboo are 100% Biodegradable.</p>
<h3>2. Bamboo is Air's Bro!</h3>
<p>Bamboo absorbs <strong>over 4 times</strong> the amount of carbon and releases <strong>35% more</strong> oxygen into the atmosphere than an equivalent stand of hardwood trees.</p>
<h3>3. Bamboo is Best Soil Protector!</h3>
<p><strong>Bamboo roots remain in place after harvesting</strong> where they prevent erosion and help retain nutrients for the next crop. </p>
<h3>4. Bamboo is Real 100% Natural!</h3>
<p><strong>No fertilizer, pesticides, or herbicides needed!</strong> Unlike most cash crops, bamboo requires no agricultural chemicals to thrive. Unlike cotton, which is one of the most intensely sprayed crops in the world and rapidly depletes the nutrients in the soil, bamboo sequesters nitrogen and cultivation does not add chemicals to the environment.</p>
<h3>5. Unique Versatility! </h3>
<p>After harvesting, virtually every part of the plant is used to make a wide variety of products. <strong>Paper, flooring, furniture, charcoal, building materials</strong>, and much more can be made from bamboo. It can be used <strong>for clothing manufacturing</strong> as well. It can be fed to livestock instead of GMO corn. What's more, <strong>bamboo fibers are far stronger than wood fibers</strong> and much less likely to warp from changing atmospheric conditions. It can be made into a plastic, and <strong>since bamboo shoots are a nutritious food</strong>, bamboo is really the answer to global poverty.</p>
<h3>6. Guiness' Book Growth Record!</h3>
<p>The <strong>world record for the fastest growing plant</strong> belongs to certain species of the 45 genera of bamboo, which have been found to grow at up to 91 cm (35 in) per day (and which grow in U.K.)!</p>
<h3>Bamboo - Yes!</h3>
<p><strong>Can Bamboo save the planet? </strong>While scientists tell us that the answer to this question remains to be seen, we say <strong>YES!</strong> This amazing plant and its surging popularity in a huge variety of products offers mankind a chance to enjoy many of the comforts of modern life without causing irreparable damage to our environment.</p>

Why? Because this one you have never been offered before!!


 


Buy One Evolution Planner Annual Set - you get Three thin and lightweight Evolution planners!

 


Each of three planners weights just 250 grams (= 0,5 lbs) 
and the thickness of each is less than 9 mm! 

Now you don't need to carry excess weight!
Each of three planners contain 200 pages for 4 months! And every four months your planner will change its cover type and color. If you want it, of course! Because Now We give you the opportunity to decide how your planner will look like! 


 


That is why Evolution Planner is Bright, Stylish and Really Individual! Because Only you can decide what color your new planner will be! And Only You choose a cover of your new planner! There are no restrictions! Exciting Real Choice of 12 colors and 3 types of covers!


 


Evolution Planner is Ultimate Eco-Friendly! Because It is made of Amazing Bamboo Paper! Nature is happy, No one tree was cut down! Bamboo isn't Tree, Bamboo is a giant Grass!

Bamboo Paper Saves Trees!
Did you know it can take 24 fully grown trees to make just one ton of paper, which is only 400 reams of A4 paper! Imagine how many trees are sacrificed every day to meet our paper needs worldwide. Now consider bamboo, a member of the grass family which can grow up to 10 times faster than wood. Due to its many environmental advantages over wood, bamboo paper is 100% Tree-Free & Eco-Friendly - Acid-Free & Carbon Neutral & Chlorine-Free!


1. Bamboo vs Deforestation! Bamboo is a superhero in the fight against deforestation!
Bamboo has an extremely low environmental impact compared with the harvesting destruction of soft wood forests which results in high impact to birds and animals, and causes extensive land scarring. When it is harvested, it will grow a new shoot from its extensive root system with no need for additional planting or cultivation. Depending on the species, bamboo can be harvested in one to five years. Hardwoods like oak take at least forty years to mature before they can be harvested. Almost 1 million acres of forests are lost each week worldwide to deforestation. Bamboo's versatility as a substitute for hardwoods offers a chance to drastically reduce that figure and protect the forests that we have left. And Yes! Bamboo are 100% Biodegradable.
2. Bamboo is Air's Bro!
Bamboo absorbs over 4 times the amount of carbon and releases 35% more oxygen into the atmosphere than an equivalent stand of hardwood trees.
3. Bamboo is Best Soil Protector!
Bamboo roots remain in place after harvesting where they prevent erosion and help retain nutrients for the next crop. 
4. Bamboo is Real 100% Natural!
No fertilizer, pesticides, or herbicides needed! Unlike most cash crops, bamboo requires no agricultural chemicals to thrive. Unlike cotton, which is one of the most intensely sprayed crops in the world and rapidly depletes the nutrients in the soil, bamboo sequesters nitrogen and cultivation does not add chemicals to the environment.
5. Unique Versatility! 
After harvesting, virtually every part of the plant is used to make a wide variety of products. Paper, flooring, furniture, charcoal, building materials, and much more can be made from bamboo. It can be used for clothing manufacturing as well. It can be fed to livestock instead of GMO corn. What's more, bamboo fibers are far stronger than wood fibers and much less likely to warp from changing atmospheric conditions. It can be made into a plastic, and since bamboo shoots are a nutritious food, bamboo is really the answer to global poverty.
6. Guiness' Book Growth Record!
The world record for the fastest growing plant belongs to certain species of the 45 genera of bamboo, which have been found to grow at up to 91 cm (35 in) per day (and which grow in U.K.)!
Bamboo - Yes!
Can Bamboo save the planet? While scientists tell us that the answer to this question remains to be seen, we say YES! This amazing plant and its surging popularity in a huge variety of products offers mankind a chance to enjoy many of the comforts of modern life without causing irreparable damage to our environment.

<h2><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1567555546/hi1kwt1j3qkgdr2dgzkv.jpg"" src=""""/></h2>
<h2>What Does it do?</h2>
<h3>Clean water and energy through thermal solar power</h3>
<p>LFree technology purifies water from any source of contamination being chemical, physical and bacteriological.</p>
<p>It efficiently desalinates ocean water, eliminates all pathogens and microorganisms from previously polluted water, including viruses, bacteria, parasites, fungi or cysts; it removes organic and inorganic compounds as well as liquid contents of latrines and poisons such as arsenic, benzene, heavy metals (lead, mercury), chlorine and chloramines.</p>
<p>LFree is composed of thermal solar power units. The thermal panels are super-efficient and extremely resistant. LFree unique “spatial configuration shape” allows the thermal tubes to be optimally exposed to incident solar irradiation during the whole day. The solution allows the monitoring of the Sun on its two axes thanks to a detector. It is extremely simple and reliable in the long term.</p>
<h3><a name=""_Hlk8936529"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Technological breakthrough without compromises</a></h3>
<p><a name=""_Hlk8936564"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">LFree’s water output does not depend on the kind of water input.</a></p>
<p>No matter how much the water feeding LFree is polluted, the result is always the same: clean water. This is the main advantage compared to other purification/desalination methods such as reverse osmosis. LFree does not needs floculant.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1567555855/eujke3ctejesaig8fxu3.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

<h2>HOW IT’S MADE</h2>
<h3>A technological heart, the central unit</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1567556078/ummugeq2wfddpagutgdd.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p><a name=""_Hlk8938235"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">The thermal power units are connected through the Central unit. It is made from an aluminum structure and composite materials.</a></p>
<p>The central unit is composed of interactive interfaces, each equipped with different workstations, and a solar park on top of its roof.</p>
<p>LFree can be equipped with user-friendly water dispensers, multi-battery chargers, 3D printers, solar coolers, ultraviolet rays sterilization chambers, touch screens (for end-user registration and communications), multiple webcams and digital and facial recognition systems, plus different kinds of sensors.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><a name=""_Hlk9856602"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">HOW IT WORKS</a></h2>
<h3>The principles behind its efficiency</h3>
<p><a name=""_Hlk8938699"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">LFree multiple-stage purification process is based on vapor compression distillation, galvanization and activated charcoal.</a></p>
<p>It has the most effective and powerful method of water purification available. In terms of efficacy, it outperforms reverse osmosis, nano-filtration or ultraviolet purification methods.</p>
<p>The water quality of LFree is outstanding, absolutely pure, low mineralized and with a perfect pH balance (6.8 – 7.2).</p>
<p>These chemical properties of the water produced by LFree are fine tunable according to the users’ preferences, tastes and legislation.</p>

<h3>From photons to electrons</h3>
<p><a name=""_Hlk8940019"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">On top of the central unit is a solar roof with its array photovoltaic panels and solar refractors.</a></p>
<p>LFree generates both AC/DC currents in full compliance with all applicable standards and regulations. The energy in the form of electricity is stored in a salt/water based internal batteries or Lithium batteries.</p>
<p>LFree’s internal electronics are protected in a special compartment provided with an innovative temperature controlling system. LFree’s electrical components are among the top rated on the market in terms of reliability and performance. The class of protection adopted ensures total protection against dust, water and power surge.</p>
<p>LFree efficiently convert different energies the very same energy it needs to function</p>
<p><a name=""_Hlk8940160"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">It does not need to be connected to an electric grid, but its communication module enables it to be part of a smart grid. LFree produces off-grid electricity to power its own internal electronics (computers, detectors, multiple-screens and different telecommunication devices), as well as external devices (portable computers, mobile phones, portable lamps, radios, televisions, household appliances).</a></p>
<p>The free electricity generated by LFree is made available to people via multiple battery chargers and electric plugs.</p>

<p>Water is actually recycled in wastewater treatment plants where biological treatments remove toxic substances from the water. However, some active pharmaceutical substances (such as diclofenac) and pesticides (such as chloredecone) cannot be degraded by bacteria. Furthermore, bacteria exposed to levels of antibiotics develop antimicrobial resistance.</p>
<p>The thermal treatment of water kills bacteria and prevents transmission of antimicrobial resistance. It allows degradation of persistent substances where biological treatment fail to reach such a result.</p>

<h3>Communication device</h3>
<p><a name=""_Hlk8940745"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">LFree is a powerful communication device capable of collecting and sending any kind of data (videos, images, audios, texts, ratios, etc.) to the Internet as well as to any other compatible communication device (smartphones…).</a></p>
<p>One single LFree unit is a standing alone machine, but two or more LFree become a network where each node is self-powered, self-sustained and multi-functional.</p>
<p>A growing number of LFree units deployed around the world will contribute to form the next big thing, the so called “Energynet”, a global smart-grid, the Internet of Energy. Another “Waternet” forms another network in which water and electricity merge with information technology.</p>

</h3>
<p><a name=""_Hlk8941652"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">The blockchain that undergirds a coin functions all on its own. This is what verifies all transactions, what keeps the coin secure, and what gives the coin its value. </a></p>
<p>On the other hand, a crypto token does not have its own blockchain. Rather, a token is built on top of an already existing blockchain. In some cases, a token eventually transforms into a coin. When that happens, the maker of the token will come up with a new blockchain. But until then, a token functions by way of an existing blockchain.</p>
<p>It should be a fiat money: Fiat money is a currency without intrinsic value that has been established as money, often by government regulation. Fiat money does not have use value and has value only because a government maintains its value, or because parties engaging in exchange agree on its value. It was introduced as an alternative to commodity money and representative money. Commodity money is created from a good, such as fuel.</p>
<p>Stablecoins are an increasingly popular type of tokens and the goal is to develop a token as many people do rely on bank accounts to pay their debts. Globally, 31 percent of adults are unbanked. The most commonly cited barrier was lack of enough money. Nearly two-thirds of adults without an account at a financial institution said that they have too little money to use one, and roughly one in five cited this as their sole reason or not having one. Worldwide, 30 percent of adults without an account at a financial institution said that they do not need one, making this the second most common reason cited.</p>
<p>Wallets have evolved from simple software programs handling key management to sophisticated applications that offer a variety of technical features and additional services that go beyond the simple storage of cryptocurrency. The final goal is to develop an open source program able using tokens to safely enable transactions between people producing electric power and safe drinking water from fossil fuel only and the one consuming them.</p>

<h3>Why we do it</h3>
<p>We create technological solutions powered by clean and renewable energies. They respect and protect the Earth’s ecosystem.</p>
<p>They are conceived through innovative design and unconventional engineering approach. We are inspired by the 4th Industrial Revolution paradigms.</p>
<h3>How we do it</h3>
<p>It just so happens that we build the most advanced and beautifully designed thermodynamic system in the world.</p>
<h3>What we do</h3>
<p>Our mission is to improve global living standards for the most in-need people in the world. We do that by providing solutions to some of the fundamental and global human needs: access to clean water and sanitation, free-energy and connectivity.</p>
<p>Our primarily product is not necessarily water or electricity, but people’s happiness and well-being.</p>
<h3>THE ENERGY NET: Information merges with water and energy</h3>
<p>Thousands of LFree units in connection between them, create the Energy net. This is the real energy smart grid and internet of things everybody has been waiting for: information merges with water and energy. A single unit of LFRee generates services to communities of many people. Each unit is scalable and versatile so that any possible configuration is feasible as well as any power-output.</p>
<p>The idea of the “Energynet” and “Water Net” grasps the truly transformational potential of combining vital and basic resources into a self-supporting ecosystem. Energy net and Water net refer to a solar powered smart grid behaving like the Internet but where information technology merges together with electricity and water.</p>
<p>Contrary to Internet, the Energy net generates more power it needs to function. Both the Energynet and Waternet will “terraform” the harshest and farthest places of the Earth establishing new communities, villages and even cities where there is nothing today. The Energy net and Water net are the real Internet of Things (IoT), that can be built where there is not Internet and where there are not things. The Energy net and Water net will free millions of people from poverty.</p>
<h4><strong>THE STANDARD GRID</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>It generates electricity and water by using from mega stations.</li>
<li>It provides low-medium quality commodities and it sells at low price.</li>
<li>It does not know anything about the customers but the actual brute consumption.</li>
<li>If the central unit fails, the entire grid fails (total black out).</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>THE SMART GRID</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>It generates electricity and water from decentralized and scalable power stations. They are interconnected forming a network.</li>
<li>It provides high quality products, sold at a premium price.</li>
<li>It knows everything about the customers, thanks to the use of sensors and intelligent interfaces.</li>
<li>If a unit fails, other units continue to sustain the grid (like Internet).</li>
<li>It generates resources with renewable and clean energy technologies.</li>
</ul>
<h4>
<strong>THE DATA NET: </strong><u>Communication is essential</u><strong><u> to the future</u></strong>
</h4>
<p>Each LFree Unit communicates with a Central Network Management Platform, as well as with other LFree units via Power-Line Communication (PLC).</p>
<p>LFree technology’s Central Network Management Platform can remotely communicate and monitor each unit of LFree technology in real time from anywhere. It is possible to run checks on the overall system, monitor performances, and change settings of water output (quantity, pH, mineralization level) through an internet connection.</p>

<h2>QUE FAIT-L’APPAREIL?</h2>
<h3>L’eau et l’énergie propres grâce à l’énergie solaire thermique</h3>
<p>La technologie LFree purifie l’eau de toute source de contamination chimique, physique et bactériologique.</p>
<p>L’appareil recycle les eaux usées, dessale efficacement l’eau de mer, élimine tous les pathogènes et les microorganismes de l’eau précédemment polluée, y compris les virus, bactéries, parasites, champignons ou kystes ; Il élimine les composés organiques et inorganiques ainsi que le contenu liquide des latrines et des poisons tels que l’arsenic, le benzène, les métaux lourds (plomb, mercure), le chlore et les chloramines.</p>
<p>LFree est composé d’unités concentrant l’énergie solaire thermique. Les panneaux thermiques sont super-efficaces et extrêmement résistants. La « conformation spatiale » unique de la technologie LFree permet aux tubes thermiques d’être exposés de manière optimale au rayonnement solaire incident pendant toute la journée. La solution permet le suivi du soleil sur ses deux axes grâce à un détecteur. Elle est extrêmement simple et fiable à long terme.</p>
<h3>Percée technologique sans compromis</h3>
<p>La qualité de l’eau produite par la technologie LFree ne dépend pas de la qualité de l’eau fournie.</p>
<p>Peu importe l’eau qui alimente le système est polluée, le résultat est toujours le même : De l’eau potable de grande qualité. C’est le principal avantage comparé à d’autres méthodes de purification/dessalement telles que l’osmose inverse. LFree n’a pas besoin d’agents floculants.</p> <p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1567559437/aps5jldbvndgudfbvob4.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

<h1>COMMENT L’appareil EST FAIT</h1>
<h2>Un cœur technologique, l’unité centrale</h2>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1567559491/el9h3yzreqbwpmteapof.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Les unités de puissance thermique sont connectées par l’unité centrale. Il est fabriqué à partir d’une structure en aluminium et de matériaux composites.</p>
<p>L’unité centrale est composée d’interfaces interactives, chacune équipée de différents postes de travail, et d’un parc solaire au-dessus de son toit.</p>
<p>LFree peut être équipé de distributeurs d’eau conviviaux, de chargeurs multi-batteries, d’imprimantes 3D, de refroidisseurs solaires, de chambres de stérilisation aux rayons ultraviolets, d’écrans tactiles (pour l’enregistrement des utilisateurs finaux et de communications), de webcams multiples et de caméras numériques et faciales systèmes de reconnaissance, ainsi que différents types de capteurs.</p>
<h1>COMMENT ÇA MARCHE</h1>
<h2>Les principes qui sous-tendent son efficacité</h2>
<p>Le processus de purification en plusieurs étapes de la technologie LFree est basé sur la distillation fractionnée par compression de vapeur, la galvanisation et le charbon actif.</p>
<p>C’est la méthode la plus efficace et la plus puissante de purification de l’eau disponible. En termes d’efficacité, elle surpasse l’osmose inverse, la nano-filtration ou les méthodes de purification aux rayons ultraviolets.</p>
<p>La qualité de l’eau de la technologie LFree est exceptionnelle, absolument pure, faiblement minéralisée et avec un parfait équilibre du pH (6,8 – 7,2).</p>
<p>Ces propriétés chimiques de l’eau produite par la technologie LFree sont en accord avec les préférences, les goûts des consommateurs et la législation et les normes sur l’eau potable.</p>

<h2>Des photons aux électrons</h2>
<p>Sur le dessus de l’unité centrale est un toit solaire avec ses panneaux photovoltaïques de tableau et réfracteurs solaires.</p>
<p>LFree génère les deux courants CA/CC en totale conformité avec toutes les normes et réglementations applicables. L’énergie sous forme d’électricité est stockée dans une batterie interne à base de sel et d’eau ou de sels de lithium.</p>
<p>L’électronique interne de LFree est protégée dans un compartiment spécial pourvu d’un système innovant de contrôle de la température. Les composants électriques de LFree sont parmi les meilleurs du marché en termes de fiabilité et de performance. La classe de protection adoptée assure une protection totale contre la poussière, l’eau et la surtension.</p>
<h2>LFree convertit efficacement différentes énergies de la même énergie dont elle a besoin pour fonctionner</h2>
<p>Il n’a pas besoin d’être connecté à un réseau électrique, mais son module de communication lui permet de faire partie d’un réseau intelligent. LFree produit de l’électricité hors réseau pour alimenter son propre système électronique interne (ordinateurs, détecteurs, écrans multiples et différents appareils de télécommunication), ainsi que des appareils externes (ordinateurs portables, téléphones mobiles, lampes portables, radios, téléviseurs, appareils ménagers).</p>

<h2>Dispositif de communication</h2>
<p>LFree est un puissant dispositif de communication capable de collecter et d’envoyer tout type de données (vidéos, images, audios, textes, ratios, etc.) à Internet ainsi qu’à tout autre dispositif de communication compatible (smartphones...).</p>
<p>Une seule unité LFree est une machine debout seule, mais deux ou plusieurs LFree deviennent un réseau où chaque nœud est auto-alimenté, auto-entretenu et multifonctionnel.</p>
<p>Un nombre croissant d’unités LFree déployées dans le monde entier contribueront à former la prochaine grande chose, le soi-disant « energynet », un réseau mondial intelligent, l’Internet de l’énergie. Un autre « Waternet » forme un autre réseau dans lequel l’eau et l’électricité fusionnent avec les technologies de l’information.</p>
<h2>Monétisation et crypto-monnaie : Blockchain, monnaies et jetons</h2>
<p>La blockchain qui sous-tend une valeur de monnaie fonctionne toute seul. C’est ce qui vérifie toutes les transactions, ce qui maintient la monnaie sécurisée, et ce qui donne à la monnaie sa valeur.</p>
<p>D’autre part, un jeton de chiffrement n’a pas sa propre blockchain. Au contraire, un jeton est construit au-dessus d’une blockchain déjà existante. Dans certains cas, un jeton finit par se transformer en monnaie. Lorsque cela se produit, le concepteur du jeton viendra avec une nouvelle blockchain. Mais jusque-là, un jeton fonctionne par le biais d’une blockchain existante.</p>
<p>Cela devrait être une monnaie fiduciaire : la monnaie fiduciaire est une monnaie sans valeur intrinsèque qui a été établie comme monnaie, souvent par la réglementation gouvernementale. La monnaie fiduciaire n’a pas d’utilité et n’a de valeur que parce qu’un gouvernement maintient sa valeur, ou parce que les parties qui s’engagent en échange conviennent de sa valeur. Il a été présenté comme une alternative à la monnaie légale des produits de base et l’argent représentatif. Sa valeur fondée sur des produits de base est créé à partir d’un bon, comme le carburant.</p>
<p>Les stablecoins sont un type de jetons de plus en plus populaire et l’objectif est de développer un jeton car beaucoup de gens ne possèdent pas de comptes bancaires pour payer leurs dettes. À l’échelle mondiale, 31% des adultes n’ont pas de compte bancaire. La barrière la plus communément citée au compte bancaire était le manque d’argent. Près des deux tiers des adultes qui n’ont pas de compte dans une institution financière ont déclaré qu’ils n’avaient pas assez d’argent pour en utiliser un, et environ un sur cinq a cité cette seule raison pour ne pas en avoir un. Dans le monde entier, 30 % des adultes sans compte dans une institution financière ont déclaré qu’ils n’en ont pas besoin, ce qui en fait la deuxième raison la plus couramment citée.</p>
<p>Les portefeuilles ont évolué à partir des logiciels de gestion simples à des applications sophistiquées qui offrent une variété de fonctionnalités techniques et des services supplémentaires qui vont au-delà du simple stockage de crypto-monnaie. L’objectif final est de développer un programme open source capable d’utiliser des jetons pour permettre des transactions en toute sécurité entre les personnes produisant de l’énergie électrique et de l’eau potable à partir de combustibles fossiles seulement et celui qui les consomme.</p>
<h2>Interactions homme-machine</h2>
<p>La technologie LFree interagit avec les personnes à travers différentes interfaces et stations de travail multi-utilitaires. LFree est équipé de plusieurs distributeurs d’eau potable, multi chargeurs de batteries, et différents types de capteurs.</p>
<p>Le système est sécurisé par une carte d’identification RFID, mais chaque fois que l’utilisateur final s’approche de la machine, la technologie LFree le reconnaît immédiatement (lorsqu’elle est enregistrée) et s’occupe de ses besoins de base. LFree recueille et signale tous les types d’interactions homme-machine, ainsi que tout ce qui se passe dans sa proximité.</p>

<h2>
<strong>Pourquoi </strong>nous le faisons</h2>
<p>Nous créons des solutions technologiques alimentées par des énergies propres et renouvelables. Ils respectent et protègent l’écosystème terrestre.</p>
<p>Ils sont conçus à travers un design innovant et une approche d’ingénierie non conventionnelle. Nous sommes inspirés par les paradigmes de la 4e révolution industrielle.</p>
<h2>
<strong>Comment</strong> nous le faisons</h2>
<p>Il se trouve que nous construisons le système thermodynamique le plus avancé et magnifiquement conçu dans le monde.</p>
<h2><strong>Ce que nous faisons</strong></h2>
<p>Notre mission est d’améliorer le niveau de vie à l’échelle mondiale pour les personnes les plus nécessiteuses. Nous le faisons en apportant des solutions à certains des besoins humains fondamentaux et mondiaux : l’accès à l’eau potable et à l’assainissement, l’énergie libre et la connectivité.</p>
<p>Notre produit principal n’est pas nécessairement l’eau ou l’électricité, mais le bonheur et le bien-être des gens.</p>
<h3>L’ENERGY NET : l’information fusionne avec l’eau et l’énergie</h3>
<p>Des milliers d’unités LFree communicant entre elles, créent le réseau d’énergie. C’est le véritable réseau intelligent d’énergie et l’Internet des choses que tout le monde attendait : l’information fusionne avec l’eau et l’énergie. Une seule unité de LFree génère des services aux communautés. Chaque unité est évolutive et polyvalente de sorte que toute configuration possible est faisable avec n’importe quelle puissance ou débit.</p>
<p>L’idée du réseau « energynet » et du « réseau d’eau » saisit le potentiel véritablement transformationnel de la combinaison des ressources vitales à la base dans un écosystème autosuffisant. Réseau d’énergie et Réseau d’eau se rapportent à un Réseau solaire intelligent fonctionnant comme l’Internet mais où la technologie de l’information fusionne avec l’électricité et l’eau.</p>
<p>Contrairement à Internet, le réseau « Energynet » génère plus de puissance qu’il a besoin de fonctionner. L’energynet et le Waternet vont « terraformer » les endroits les plus difficiles et les plus éloignés de la terre, établissant de nouvelles communautés, villages et même des villes où il n’y a rien aujourd’hui. Le réseau d’énergie et le réseau d’eau sont les objets connectés réels (IoT) , qui peuvent être construit là où il n’y a pas Internet et où il n’y a rien. Le réseau d’énergie et le réseau d’eau vont libérer des millions de personnes de la pauvreté.</p>
<h4><strong>Le réseau standard</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>Il génère de l’électricité et de l’eau en utilisant des méga-stations.</li>
<li>Il fournit des produits de qualité moyenne et vend à bas prix.</li>
<li>Il ne sait rien sur les clients, mais seulement sur la consommation brute réelle.</li>
<li>Si la centrale tombe en panne, le réseau entier tombe (Blackout).</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>LE SMART GRID</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>Il génère de l’électricité et de l’eau à partir de microcentrales décentralisées et évolutives. Elles sont reliées entre elles en formant un réseau.</li>
<li>Il fournit des produits de haute qualité, vendus à un prix Premium.</li>
<li>Il sait tout sur les clients, grâce à l’utilisation de capteurs et d’interfaces intelligentes.</li>
<li>Si une unité échoue, d’autres unités continuent de maintenir le réseau (comme Internet).</li>
<li>Il génère des ressources avec des technologies énergétiques renouvelables et propres.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>LE DATA NET : la communication est essentielle pour l’avenir</strong></h4>
<p>Chaque unité LFree communique avec une plate-forme de gestion de réseau centralisée, ainsi qu’avec d’autres unités LFree via un courant porteur de ligne (CPL).</p>
<p>La plate-forme de gestion de réseau centralisée de la technologie LFree peut communiquer et surveiller à distance chaque unité de la technologie LFree en temps réel, de n’importe où. Il est possible d’exécuter des vérifications sur le système global, de surveiller les performances et de modifier les réglages de la sortie d’eau (quantité, pH, niveau de minéralisation) via une connexion Internet.</p>

The unique micro power station generating drinking water


What Does it do?
Clean water and energy through thermal solar power
LFree technology purifies water from any source of contamination being chemical, physical and bacteriological.
It efficiently desalinates ocean water, eliminates all pathogens and microorganisms from previously polluted water, including viruses, bacteria, parasites, fungi or cysts; it removes organic and inorganic compounds as well as liquid contents of latrines and poisons such as arsenic, benzene, heavy metals (lead, mercury), chlorine and chloramines.
LFree is composed of thermal solar power units. The thermal panels are super-efficient and extremely resistant. LFree unique “spatial configuration shape” allows the thermal tubes to be optimally exposed to incident solar irradiation during the whole day. The solution allows the monitoring of the Sun on its two axes thanks to a detector. It is extremely simple and reliable in the long term.
Technological breakthrough without compromises
LFree’s water output does not depend on the kind of water input.
No matter how much the water feeding LFree is polluted, the result is always the same: clean water. This is the main advantage compared to other purification/desalination methods such as reverse osmosis. LFree does not needs floculant.


HOW IT’S MADE
A technological heart, the central unit

The thermal power units are connected through the Central unit. It is made from an aluminum structure and composite materials.
The central unit is composed of interactive interfaces, each equipped with different workstations, and a solar park on top of its roof.
LFree can be equipped with user-friendly water dispensers, multi-battery chargers, 3D printers, solar coolers, ultraviolet rays sterilization chambers, touch screens (for end-user registration and communications), multiple webcams and digital and facial recognition systems, plus different kinds of sensors.
 
HOW IT WORKS
The principles behind its efficiency
LFree multiple-stage purification process is based on vapor compression distillation, galvanization and activated charcoal.
It has the most effective and powerful method of water purification available. In terms of efficacy, it outperforms reverse osmosis, nano-filtration or ultraviolet purification methods.
The water quality of LFree is outstanding, absolutely pure, low mineralized and with a perfect pH balance (6.8 – 7.2).
These chemical properties of the water produced by LFree are fine tunable according to the users’ preferences, tastes and legislation.


ELECTRICITY


From photons to electrons
On top of the central unit is a solar roof with its array photovoltaic panels and solar refractors.
LFree generates both AC/DC currents in full compliance with all applicable standards and regulations. The energy in the form of electricity is stored in a salt/water based internal batteries or Lithium batteries.
LFree’s internal electronics are protected in a special compartment provided with an innovative temperature controlling system. LFree’s electrical components are among the top rated on the market in terms of reliability and performance. The class of protection adopted ensures total protection against dust, water and power surge.
LFree efficiently convert different energies the very same energy it needs to function
It does not need to be connected to an electric grid, but its communication module enables it to be part of a smart grid. LFree produces off-grid electricity to power its own internal electronics (computers, detectors, multiple-screens and different telecommunication devices), as well as external devices (portable computers, mobile phones, portable lamps, radios, televisions, household appliances).
The free electricity generated by LFree is made available to people via multiple battery chargers and electric plugs.
 
WATER

Water is actually recycled in wastewater treatment plants where biological treatments remove toxic substances from the water. However, some active pharmaceutical substances (such as diclofenac) and pesticides (such as chloredecone) cannot be degraded by bacteria. Furthermore, bacteria exposed to levels of antibiotics develop antimicrobial resistance.
The thermal treatment of water kills bacteria and prevents transmission of antimicrobial resistance. It allows degradation of persistent substances where biological treatment fail to reach such a result.

 CONNECTIVITY

Communication device
LFree is a powerful communication device capable of collecting and sending any kind of data (videos, images, audios, texts, ratios, etc.) to the Internet as well as to any other compatible communication device (smartphones…).
One single LFree unit is a standing alone machine, but two or more LFree become a network where each node is self-powered, self-sustained and multi-functional.
A growing number of LFree units deployed around the world will contribute to form the next big thing, the so called “Energynet”, a global smart-grid, the Internet of Energy. Another “Waternet” forms another network in which water and electricity merge with information technology.

Monetization and cryptocurrency: Blockchain, coins and tokens

The blockchain that undergirds a coin functions all on its own. This is what verifies all transactions, what keeps the coin secure, and what gives the coin its value. 
On the other hand, a crypto token does not have its own blockchain. Rather, a token is built on top of an already existing blockchain. In some cases, a token eventually transforms into a coin. When that happens, the maker of the token will come up with a new blockchain. But until then, a token functions by way of an existing blockchain.
It should be a fiat money: Fiat money is a currency without intrinsic value that has been established as money, often by government regulation. Fiat money does not have use value and has value only because a government maintains its value, or because parties engaging in exchange agree on its value. It was introduced as an alternative to commodity money and representative money. Commodity money is created from a good, such as fuel.
Stablecoins are an increasingly popular type of tokens and the goal is to develop a token as many people do rely on bank accounts to pay their debts. Globally, 31 percent of adults are unbanked. The most commonly cited barrier was lack of enough money. Nearly two-thirds of adults without an account at a financial institution said that they have too little money to use one, and roughly one in five cited this as their sole reason or not having one. Worldwide, 30 percent of adults without an account at a financial institution said that they do not need one, making this the second most common reason cited.
Wallets have evolved from simple software programs handling key management to sophisticated applications that offer a variety of technical features and additional services that go beyond the simple storage of cryptocurrency. The final goal is to develop an open source program able using tokens to safely enable transactions between people producing electric power and safe drinking water from fossil fuel only and the one consuming them.
Human to machine interactions
LFree technology interacts with people through different interfaces and multi-utilities workstations. LFree is equipped with multiple user-friendly water dispensers, multi-batteries charger and different kind of sensors.
The system is secured by a RFID identification card but every time the end user approaches the machine, LFree technology immediately recognizes him/her (when registered) and attends to his/her basic needs. LFree collects and reports all types of human-to-machine interactions, as well as everything that happen in its proximity.
 Commitment to the COP21 agreements

Why we do it
We create technological solutions powered by clean and renewable energies. They respect and protect the Earth’s ecosystem.
They are conceived through innovative design and unconventional engineering approach. We are inspired by the 4th Industrial Revolution paradigms.
How we do it
It just so happens that we build the most advanced and beautifully designed thermodynamic system in the world.
What we do
Our mission is to improve global living standards for the most in-need people in the world. We do that by providing solutions to some of the fundamental and global human needs: access to clean water and sanitation, free-energy and connectivity.
Our primarily product is not necessarily water or electricity, but people’s happiness and well-being.
THE ENERGY NET: Information merges with water and energy
Thousands of LFree units in connection between them, create the Energy net. This is the real energy smart grid and internet of things everybody has been waiting for: information merges with water and energy. A single unit of LFRee generates services to communities of many people. Each unit is scalable and versatile so that any possible configuration is feasible as well as any power-output.
The idea of the “Energynet” and “Water Net” grasps the truly transformational potential of combining vital and basic resources into a self-supporting ecosystem. Energy net and Water net refer to a solar powered smart grid behaving like the Internet but where information technology merges together with electricity and water.
Contrary to Internet, the Energy net generates more power it needs to function. Both the Energynet and Waternet will “terraform” the harshest and farthest places of the Earth establishing new communities, villages and even cities where there is nothing today. The Energy net and Water net are the real Internet of Things (IoT), that can be built where there is not Internet and where there are not things. The Energy net and Water net will free millions of people from poverty.
THE STANDARD GRID

It generates electricity and water by using from mega stations.
It provides low-medium quality commodities and it sells at low price.
It does not know anything about the customers but the actual brute consumption.
If the central unit fails, the entire grid fails (total black out).

THE SMART GRID

It generates electricity and water from decentralized and scalable power stations. They are interconnected forming a network.
It provides high quality products, sold at a premium price.
It knows everything about the customers, thanks to the use of sensors and intelligent interfaces.
If a unit fails, other units continue to sustain the grid (like Internet).
It generates resources with renewable and clean energy technologies.


THE DATA NET: Communication is essential to the future

Each LFree Unit communicates with a Central Network Management Platform, as well as with other LFree units via Power-Line Communication (PLC).
LFree technology’s Central Network Management Platform can remotely communicate and monitor each unit of LFree technology in real time from anywhere. It is possible to run checks on the overall system, monitor performances, and change settings of water output (quantity, pH, mineralization level) through an internet connection.
 What you get :

* The local company must meet several criteria defined in advance such as a minimum of incomes or maximum turnover, a number of employees, its willing to comply with our policy... You may propose a company of your choice, but this company should meet our social criteria (social and solidarity economy) and the skills (building construction public works - technical installations).
Otherwise, you can pick up one company among the list of companies we will provide to you.
** of your choice: it may be your location if you desire (for which you will be kept
updated when the technology is ready after certification by local authorities).
*** Any location that do not receive a solar flux above 1 000 W/m2 (usually, outside the tropical area) is unfit and any location where the local regulation prohibits such a construction is unfit.
Otherwise, you can choose to sponsorship the people who will benefit from this technology. You may designate us the beneficiary of your choice or choose from a list of potential beneficiaries that we propose. Please note that if you designate a beneficiary of your choice outside the list of potential beneficiaries, you have the obligation to indicate a company that is willing to build the micro powerplant.
**** Please note that the cost of building modules 2 and / or 3 is not taken into account and remains at your charge.
 
What you don't get :
Module 2, generating Electric Power and Module 3 generating drinking water. For these 2 modules, you would need to finance it by paying the local installer. However, if you sponsored the training of this local company, you might be in position to ask for a reduction on the prices!
 
How to support the LFree project? 
Bio-S-TEAM are moving the LFree project to Crowdfunding because the team needs to test how much people are truly ready to get involved in saving the Earth from global warming. We are ready to assess and apply the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) conclusions about the time window mankind has to act in order to curb the global warming impact on Earth life sustainable environment. Since governments are not allocating sufficient funds to improve disruptive models or keep making grants difficult to access to SME and the COP21 agreement is not really implemented at the global level.
Your support is an evidence that there is a real market for the product and will enable us to get:

A loan from investors
A grant from European union institutions

Even though we have the goal of raising a total of 7,000 euros, even a small amount counts as it shows that you and many people are involved and back-up the LFree project to improve the human condition.

L’unique microcentrale électrique générant de l'eau potable


QUE FAIT-L’APPAREIL?
L’eau et l’énergie propres grâce à l’énergie solaire thermique
La technologie LFree purifie l’eau de toute source de contamination chimique, physique et bactériologique.
L’appareil recycle les eaux usées, dessale efficacement l’eau de mer, élimine tous les pathogènes et les microorganismes de l’eau précédemment polluée, y compris les virus, bactéries, parasites, champignons ou kystes ; Il élimine les composés organiques et inorganiques ainsi que le contenu liquide des latrines et des poisons tels que l’arsenic, le benzène, les métaux lourds (plomb, mercure), le chlore et les chloramines.
LFree est composé d’unités concentrant l’énergie solaire thermique. Les panneaux thermiques sont super-efficaces et extrêmement résistants. La « conformation spatiale » unique de la technologie LFree permet aux tubes thermiques d’être exposés de manière optimale au rayonnement solaire incident pendant toute la journée. La solution permet le suivi du soleil sur ses deux axes grâce à un détecteur. Elle est extrêmement simple et fiable à long terme.
Percée technologique sans compromis
La qualité de l’eau produite par la technologie LFree ne dépend pas de la qualité de l’eau fournie.
Peu importe l’eau qui alimente le système est polluée, le résultat est toujours le même : De l’eau potable de grande qualité. C’est le principal avantage comparé à d’autres méthodes de purification/dessalement telles que l’osmose inverse. LFree n’a pas besoin d’agents floculants. 

COMMENT L’appareil EST FAIT
Un cœur technologique, l’unité centrale

Les unités de puissance thermique sont connectées par l’unité centrale. Il est fabriqué à partir d’une structure en aluminium et de matériaux composites.
L’unité centrale est composée d’interfaces interactives, chacune équipée de différents postes de travail, et d’un parc solaire au-dessus de son toit.
LFree peut être équipé de distributeurs d’eau conviviaux, de chargeurs multi-batteries, d’imprimantes 3D, de refroidisseurs solaires, de chambres de stérilisation aux rayons ultraviolets, d’écrans tactiles (pour l’enregistrement des utilisateurs finaux et de communications), de webcams multiples et de caméras numériques et faciales systèmes de reconnaissance, ainsi que différents types de capteurs.
COMMENT ÇA MARCHE
Les principes qui sous-tendent son efficacité
Le processus de purification en plusieurs étapes de la technologie LFree est basé sur la distillation fractionnée par compression de vapeur, la galvanisation et le charbon actif.
C’est la méthode la plus efficace et la plus puissante de purification de l’eau disponible. En termes d’efficacité, elle surpasse l’osmose inverse, la nano-filtration ou les méthodes de purification aux rayons ultraviolets.
La qualité de l’eau de la technologie LFree est exceptionnelle, absolument pure, faiblement minéralisée et avec un parfait équilibre du pH (6,8 – 7,2).
Ces propriétés chimiques de l’eau produite par la technologie LFree sont en accord avec les préférences, les goûts des consommateurs et la législation et les normes sur l’eau potable.

lectricité

Des photons aux électrons
Sur le dessus de l’unité centrale est un toit solaire avec ses panneaux photovoltaïques de tableau et réfracteurs solaires.
LFree génère les deux courants CA/CC en totale conformité avec toutes les normes et réglementations applicables. L’énergie sous forme d’électricité est stockée dans une batterie interne à base de sel et d’eau ou de sels de lithium.
L’électronique interne de LFree est protégée dans un compartiment spécial pourvu d’un système innovant de contrôle de la température. Les composants électriques de LFree sont parmi les meilleurs du marché en termes de fiabilité et de performance. La classe de protection adoptée assure une protection totale contre la poussière, l’eau et la surtension.
LFree convertit efficacement différentes énergies de la même énergie dont elle a besoin pour fonctionner
Il n’a pas besoin d’être connecté à un réseau électrique, mais son module de communication lui permet de faire partie d’un réseau intelligent. LFree produit de l’électricité hors réseau pour alimenter son propre système électronique interne (ordinateurs, détecteurs, écrans multiples et différents appareils de télécommunication), ainsi que des appareils externes (ordinateurs portables, téléphones mobiles, lampes portables, radios, téléviseurs, appareils ménagers).
Il n'a pas besoin d'être connecté à un réeau électrique, mais son module de communication lui permet de faire partie d'un réeau intelligent. LFree produit de l'électricité hors réeaupour alimenter son propre système électronique interne (ordinateurs, détecteurs, écrans multiples et différents appareils de télécommunication), ainsi que des appareils externes (ordinateurs portables, téléphones mobiles, lampes, radios, téléviseurs, appareils ménagers. 
L’électricité gratuite générée par la technologie LFree est disponible pour les personnes via plusieurs chargeurs de batterie et des prises électriques. 
L’Eau

Les usines de traitement des eaux usées où les traitements biologiques éliminent les substances toxiques de l'eau. Cependant, certaines substances actives (comme le diclofénac) et les pesticides (comme le chlorédecone) ne peuvent pas être dégradées par des bactéries. En outre, les bactéries exposées à des niveaux d'antibiotiques développent une résistance aux antimicrobiens.
Le traitement thermique de l'eau tue les bactéries et empêche la transmission de la résistance aux antimicrobiens. Il permet la dégradation des substances persistantes lorsque le traitement biologique n'atteint pas un tel résultat.   Connectivité

Dispositif de communication
LFree est un puissant dispositif de communication capable de collecter et d’envoyer tout type de données (vidéos, images, audios, textes, ratios, etc.) à Internet ainsi qu’à tout autre dispositif de communication compatible (smartphones...).
Une seule unité LFree est une machine debout seule, mais deux ou plusieurs LFree deviennent un réseau où chaque nœud est auto-alimenté, auto-entretenu et multifonctionnel.
Un nombre croissant d’unités LFree déployées dans le monde entier contribueront à former la prochaine grande chose, le soi-disant « energynet », un réseau mondial intelligent, l’Internet de l’énergie. Un autre « Waternet » forme un autre réseau dans lequel l’eau et l’électricité fusionnent avec les technologies de l’information.
Monétisation et crypto-monnaie : Blockchain, monnaies et jetons
La blockchain qui sous-tend une valeur de monnaie fonctionne toute seul. C’est ce qui vérifie toutes les transactions, ce qui maintient la monnaie sécurisée, et ce qui donne à la monnaie sa valeur.
D’autre part, un jeton de chiffrement n’a pas sa propre blockchain. Au contraire, un jeton est construit au-dessus d’une blockchain déjà existante. Dans certains cas, un jeton finit par se transformer en monnaie. Lorsque cela se produit, le concepteur du jeton viendra avec une nouvelle blockchain. Mais jusque-là, un jeton fonctionne par le biais d’une blockchain existante.
Cela devrait être une monnaie fiduciaire : la monnaie fiduciaire est une monnaie sans valeur intrinsèque qui a été établie comme monnaie, souvent par la réglementation gouvernementale. La monnaie fiduciaire n’a pas d’utilité et n’a de valeur que parce qu’un gouvernement maintient sa valeur, ou parce que les parties qui s’engagent en échange conviennent de sa valeur. Il a été présenté comme une alternative à la monnaie légale des produits de base et l’argent représentatif. Sa valeur fondée sur des produits de base est créé à partir d’un bon, comme le carburant.
Les stablecoins sont un type de jetons de plus en plus populaire et l’objectif est de développer un jeton car beaucoup de gens ne possèdent pas de comptes bancaires pour payer leurs dettes. À l’échelle mondiale, 31% des adultes n’ont pas de compte bancaire. La barrière la plus communément citée au compte bancaire était le manque d’argent. Près des deux tiers des adultes qui n’ont pas de compte dans une institution financière ont déclaré qu’ils n’avaient pas assez d’argent pour en utiliser un, et environ un sur cinq a cité cette seule raison pour ne pas en avoir un. Dans le monde entier, 30 % des adultes sans compte dans une institution financière ont déclaré qu’ils n’en ont pas besoin, ce qui en fait la deuxième raison la plus couramment citée.
Les portefeuilles ont évolué à partir des logiciels de gestion simples à des applications sophistiquées qui offrent une variété de fonctionnalités techniques et des services supplémentaires qui vont au-delà du simple stockage de crypto-monnaie. L’objectif final est de développer un programme open source capable d’utiliser des jetons pour permettre des transactions en toute sécurité entre les personnes produisant de l’énergie électrique et de l’eau potable à partir de combustibles fossiles seulement et celui qui les consomme.
Interactions homme-machine
La technologie LFree interagit avec les personnes à travers différentes interfaces et stations de travail multi-utilitaires. LFree est équipé de plusieurs distributeurs d’eau potable, multi chargeurs de batteries, et différents types de capteurs.
Le système est sécurisé par une carte d’identification RFID, mais chaque fois que l’utilisateur final s’approche de la machine, la technologie LFree le reconnaît immédiatement (lorsqu’elle est enregistrée) et s’occupe de ses besoins de base. LFree recueille et signale tous les types d’interactions homme-machine, ainsi que tout ce qui se passe dans sa proximité.
  ENGAGEMENT ENVERS LES ACCORDS DE LA COP21


Pourquoi nous le faisons
Nous créons des solutions technologiques alimentées par des énergies propres et renouvelables. Ils respectent et protègent l’écosystème terrestre.
Ils sont conçus à travers un design innovant et une approche d’ingénierie non conventionnelle. Nous sommes inspirés par les paradigmes de la 4e révolution industrielle.

Comment nous le faisons
Il se trouve que nous construisons le système thermodynamique le plus avancé et magnifiquement conçu dans le monde.
Ce que nous faisons
Notre mission est d’améliorer le niveau de vie à l’échelle mondiale pour les personnes les plus nécessiteuses. Nous le faisons en apportant des solutions à certains des besoins humains fondamentaux et mondiaux : l’accès à l’eau potable et à l’assainissement, l’énergie libre et la connectivité.
Notre produit principal n’est pas nécessairement l’eau ou l’électricité, mais le bonheur et le bien-être des gens.
L’ENERGY NET : l’information fusionne avec l’eau et l’énergie
Des milliers d’unités LFree communicant entre elles, créent le réseau d’énergie. C’est le véritable réseau intelligent d’énergie et l’Internet des choses que tout le monde attendait : l’information fusionne avec l’eau et l’énergie. Une seule unité de LFree génère des services aux communautés. Chaque unité est évolutive et polyvalente de sorte que toute configuration possible est faisable avec n’importe quelle puissance ou débit.
L’idée du réseau « energynet » et du « réseau d’eau » saisit le potentiel véritablement transformationnel de la combinaison des ressources vitales à la base dans un écosystème autosuffisant. Réseau d’énergie et Réseau d’eau se rapportent à un Réseau solaire intelligent fonctionnant comme l’Internet mais où la technologie de l’information fusionne avec l’électricité et l’eau.
Contrairement à Internet, le réseau « Energynet » génère plus de puissance qu’il a besoin de fonctionner. L’energynet et le Waternet vont « terraformer » les endroits les plus difficiles et les plus éloignés de la terre, établissant de nouvelles communautés, villages et même des villes où il n’y a rien aujourd’hui. Le réseau d’énergie et le réseau d’eau sont les objets connectés réels (IoT) , qui peuvent être construit là où il n’y a pas Internet et où il n’y a rien. Le réseau d’énergie et le réseau d’eau vont libérer des millions de personnes de la pauvreté.
Le réseau standard

Il génère de l’électricité et de l’eau en utilisant des méga-stations.
Il fournit des produits de qualité moyenne et vend à bas prix.
Il ne sait rien sur les clients, mais seulement sur la consommation brute réelle.
Si la centrale tombe en panne, le réseau entier tombe (Blackout).

LE SMART GRID

Il génère de l’électricité et de l’eau à partir de microcentrales décentralisées et évolutives. Elles sont reliées entre elles en formant un réseau.
Il fournit des produits de haute qualité, vendus à un prix Premium.
Il sait tout sur les clients, grâce à l’utilisation de capteurs et d’interfaces intelligentes.
Si une unité échoue, d’autres unités continuent de maintenir le réseau (comme Internet).
Il génère des ressources avec des technologies énergétiques renouvelables et propres.

LE DATA NET : la communication est essentielle pour l’avenir
Chaque unité LFree communique avec une plate-forme de gestion de réseau centralisée, ainsi qu’avec d’autres unités LFree via un courant porteur de ligne (CPL).
La plate-forme de gestion de réseau centralisée de la technologie LFree peut communiquer et surveiller à distance chaque unité de la technologie LFree en temps réel, de n’importe où. Il est possible d’exécuter des vérifications sur le système global, de surveiller les performances et de modifier les réglages de la sortie d’eau (quantité, pH, niveau de minéralisation) via une connexion Internet.

<h3>The Right Spectrum For Every Plant</h3>
<p>The EQ family was designed to exceed expectations for what an indoor grow light should be.  Select between three product variations to satisfy specific growing applications:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>EQ-1</strong>  <ul><li>A single-color fixture utilizing full spectrum white LEDs.  This is a great dual-purpose solution for applications that require efficient lighting for plant growth, yet also require high quality white light for general illumination.  The EQ-1 is manually controlled with a simple on/off switch.  When ordering, select between a warm white spectrum (3000K CCT) and a daylight spectrum (5000K CCT).</li></ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>EQ-2</strong>  <ul><li>A dual-color fixture utilizing red and blue LEDs.  This solution emits a purple light that is targeted for efficient absorption by plant pigments.  The targeted narrow spectrum LEDs utilized in the EQ-2 provide an increase in available PAR light when compared to the EQ-1.  The EQ-2 is manually controlled with a simple on/off switch.  When ordering, select between a vegetative spectrum (blue dominant) and flowering spectrum (red dominant).</li></ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>EQ-3</strong><ul><li>
<strong>​</strong>A smart, WiFi connected fixture with a tunable spectrum.  The EQ-3 has three independently controlled channels of LEDs:  red, white, and blue.  Over a million spectral combinations are possible to meet the specific needs of various plants.  A custom on/off schedule can be programmed to control the hours of illumination during a plant's life-cycle. </li></ul>

<p> </p>
<h3>Open Source Ideology</h3>
<p>We believe in the power of the open source movement.  By putting our design files in the public domain, we aim to cultivate rapid innovation from the open source community.  We want our users to not only have a voice in what our products deliver, but also have a hand in the product development life-cycle itself.  Furthermore, one of our long term goals is to foster a community of diverse users who openly share plant light recipes.  This sort of broad community engagement is only possible if we embrace open source values from the very beginning.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1503011878/tadodnghji4qilf2w0ql.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Where We Are</h3>
<p>We currently have fully functional prototypes and a working web client to control the EQ-3 via WiFi.  Several critical validation tests have been performed to confirm that our high standards have been achieved throughout the development process, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Temperature testing in an elevated ambient to ensure reliable operation in demanding environments.</li>
<li>Electrical testing to confirm that the LEDs and driver circuitry are being operated within recommended parameters.</li>
<li>Optical testing to characterize the light distribution and intensity with various lenses and LEDs.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>We have many years of experience bringing new products to market at small and large sized companies.  We have an acute understanding of the inherent difficulties of designing, engineering, and manufacturing a wide range of LED lighting products.  Our experiences have driven us towards a lean design and manufacturing system to bring the EQ to market.  Many of our design decisions were influenced by the need for just-in-time manufacturing.  Additionally, our EQ design requires a minimum amount of production tooling.  This design strategy allows us to fabricate most parts of the EQ in small volumes with little capital expenditures.  </p>
<p>However, our electronics are still very much affected by economies of scale.  We need to purchase the components for our driver and LED PCBs in medium-to-high volumes in order to meet reasonable price breaks.  Our $10,000 campaign goal will enable us to purchase the necessary inventory to fulfill our dream of supplying top quality LED horticulture lights to enthusiasts around the world. </p>

<h3>Growing More Than Plants </h3>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Developing a new product is a difficult, time-consuming, and often frustrating process.  While we have overcome a series of technical obstacles to get to this point, there are still a number of challenges yet to come.  Below is a list of the biggest risks and challenges we have identified for the order fulfillment phase, along with our plan to address these potential problems:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Strategic Sourcing</strong><ul>
<li>
<i>The Problem: </i> We are dependent upon a network of suppliers, distributors, and manufacturers to deliver the materials we need to assemble our product.  Supplier lead-times, distributor stock levels, and the discontinuing of components have a direct impact on our ability to ship finished products to our customers in a timely fashion.  </li>
<li>
<i>The Risk Mitigation Plan: </i> Alternate components and secondary suppliers have been identified for all critical items on our bill of materials.  This has prepared us to quickly respond to component shortages and limit the impact to our delivery schedule.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Software Development</strong><ul>
<li>
<i>The Problem:</i>  Our fully functional prototypes of the EQ-3 are presently operated via a WiFi web client.  Our goal is to further develop the WiFi app's user interface.  Software development and debugging is time-consuming work and can put a strain on a startup with limited resources.</li>
<li>
<i>The Risk Mitigation Plan:  </i>The WiFi app development is already underway, but we plan on adding resources to our team by partnering with freelance programmers.  This workforce flexibility will allow us to add resources if software programming becomes the critical path activity on our development timeline.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Manufacturing Capacity</strong><ul>
<li>
<i>The Problem:</i>  Manufacturing any product requires a significant amount of resources in the form of labor, equipment, and storage space.  As production volume increases, the manufacturing overhead costs also increase proportionally.  Consequentially, a startup company with limited resources can experience growing pains while ramping up production of a new product.</li>
<li>
<i>The Risk Mitigation Plan:  </i>Our operations are currently based out of mHUB in Chicago, the city's first innovation center for physical product development and manufacturing.  This affords us access to advanced prototyping and manufacturing equipment typically reserved for large established companies.  Our initial low-volume production runs will be completed in this facility and serve as our temporary factory as we transition to a building of our own.  </li>

</div></div>","Scoop Marketplace is a zero-waste grocery store where customers fill reusable containers with our variety of package-free food, home goods, and personal care products. Our mission is to normalize zero waste shopping by teaching people how to improve the quality of their lives as they learn to walk more gently on the planet.
 

 
At Scoop Marketplace we provide a welcoming atmosphere where customers can conveniently shop in-store or online to purchase safe, high-quality food and home goods free from costly, inconvenient, and harmful packaging, and in whatever quantity they need or desire. We thoroughly research the vendors we work with and partner with businesses whose values align with our own.
 

 
Our products encourage sustainable living, our sourcing supports ethical businesses with an emphasis on small, local, and minority-owned, and we have the opportunity to work with businesses and consumers to normalize reusables. We are committed to finding innovative ways to offer this service while meeting the demands of our modern culture. Scoop Marketplace is the future of food, the way it used to be. 
 

 

 
Funding Goal is $32,000  
$18,000 Fridge & Freezer for Fresh Produce, Frozen Bulk Items like Local Berries & Cookie Dough, and Fresh Prepared Items such as Vegan Cheese, Sauerkraut & Salsas
$8,000 Nut Butter Grinder
$4,000 Draught Cooler for Beverages on Tap like Kombucha & Cold Brew 
$2,000 Upgraded Scales & Tare Deduction Technology for a more streamlined shopping experience
Reach Funding Goal $50,000
$6,000 Convection Oven for Fresh Baked Goods in the shop
$8,000 Grain Mills for fresh milled flours (one designated for gluten free)
$2,000 Nut Milk Machine
$2,000 Coffee Grinder
With the shop re-opening and growing rapidly, we are still in need of certain pieces of equipment to expand our offerings and become a full-service, package-free grocery store. The funds raised will be used to install equipment including refrigerators for produce and fresh bulk foods, a tap system for bulk oils/beverages, nut butter grinders, a coffee grinder, an oven for fresh baked goods, and an upgraded scale system to streamline our operations and provide an even better customer experience.
If we exceed our goal, we would like to install a full tap system to accommodate up to 20 different liquid bulk items on tap. Utilizing taps would allow us to maximize the storage space available in our back-of-house area and offer a very user-friendly experience in the front of house in order to expand our variety of liquid bulk items.
 


 
Every contribution helps! No donation amount is too small and we are grateful for each and every one. We're also partnering up with some of our favorite local businesses/brands to offer several 'perks' at various price points as a way to give back and say thank you! Here are a few examples:

<p>Educating the new generation on plastic pollution is essential to end it and it's what we want to do through this childrensbook.

<p>Despite a steep learning curve and this being our first book we are now finally ready to print the book in English and Swedish &amp; can also be ordered in Danish for those who want. We could not have done this without the amazing help from family and friends that all believed in the project. Last but certainly not least a huge thank you to the amazing illustrations by Maria Kirshina, she was as if sent from heaven. Many great friends also supported and helped us, like our colleague Jakob Æbeløe Kjøller. We looked for the perfect illustrator for over 6 months before finding Maria and magic happened when she got on board with her amazing drawing skills.</p>

<h3>Leveling up!</h3>
<p>For the last 18 months we've been growing and collecting food and yard waste from community members.  It started as 12 of us and has grown to 270 members today.  In that time we've diverted 40,000 pounds of waste from landfills.  We want to keep growing and in order to do so, we need some more space and machinery.  We have an agreement to provide us some space and once we get there, then we'll have to prepare the site and have a way of moving compost around.  That's where the machinery comes in.</p>
<h3>Hi!</h3>
<p>I'm Bob Mattax.  I work with software by trade, but enjoy all things outdoors and want to do something to make a lasting impact in my community and environment. It turns out ScrapCycle is doing that and I'm hoping that we can keep growing and keep growing our impact to more and more communities in Indiana, and someday beyond.   We have adopted a pretty non-capitalist business model.  Nobody is mandated to pay, but we ask that you pay as much as you can.  Generally, this makes our reach greater, but are cash flow suffers.  That's mostly ok, BUT... for the purpose of this grant, we want to maximize how much we're able to push in, so that we also maximize what we get out.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What do we want to buy?</h3>
<p>I'm glad you asked.  We are in the process of getting a new composting site approved by the state.  Once that is done, we will have a bunch of stuff we need:</p>
<ul>
<li>$5,000  = We need concrete blocks and money to rent machines to move them around and create our ""space"".  Grading the site and creating a retention pond and some other site infrastructure</li>
<li>$14,000 = We need money to buy a ""gently"" used tractor.  If we can swing it, we're going to buy it from another non-profit in town ( <a href=""http://farmished.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Farmished</a> ) so that they instantly get a boost from this fundraiser as well.</li>
<li>$1,000 = We want to buy some fancy, sealed, compost toters to provide to commercial clients so that we can start approaching big compost creating businesses ( like coffee shops, restaurants, etc ) </li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Every month we're diverting 2 tons of compost from landfills.  The emissions math works out that that is about the same as stopping approximately 300 gallons of gasoline from being burned.  It only gets better as we are able to service more and more homes and businesses.</p>

A growing number of entrepreneurs, investors, and technology executives are rising to meet the challenge of climate change. Women in Climate Tech is an international network dedicated to helping women and nonbinary people in this work.
Since our founding in December 2020, our platform has grown to 400+ members and 750 subscribers from businesses, academia, and sustainability offices at some of the largest businesses in the world, including Microsoft, Google, Amazon, and more.
What's your mission? 
Our mission is to empower and amplify the voices of women working in the industry, and to grow the share of women represented who will work on this issue for generations to come.
Why does gender matter?
Emerging research shows the critical importance of gender in climate change work, and the impact of empowering women in developing countries and in the corporate world.

<p>Ultimate field guide on Australian plants their relationships within ecosystems and repairing the land.  </p>
<p>We are really excited to announce that pre-orders for renowned bush ethno-botanist and native plant author Neville Bonney's forthcoming book, From One Small Seed a Forest is Born are now open.   </p>
<p>By purchasing a copy, you will contribute to the publishing and printing costs of the First Edition of One Small Seed a Forest is Born. You’ll also receive a special First Edition Hardcover signed copy from the author, Neville Bonney posted to your address.  </p>
<p>This comprehensive field guide, (close to 600 pages) is about Australian Native Plants and their seeds. Fully illustrated in colour, features identification through flowers, fruits and seeds in scale size, some 700 species from 63 families and 240 genera, complemented with photos in the field on Australian landscapes, birds, ants, butterflies, bees and much more.  </p>
<p>Most species entered have detailed descriptions, distribution maps, details on their pollinators, seed dispersal, seed collection, propagation, ecology and Indigenous names and uses.  </p>
<p>It helps the reader to gain further knowledge to help restore ecosystems and landscapes. There are also introductory notes on our changing landscapes, history and other related topics.  </p>
<p>Neville's knowledge of Indigenous plants gained through his many friendships and collaborations with Aboriginal people while researching and writing his books is also recorded. How plants were used traditionally for food, medicine and tools are explained for hundreds of plant species. </p>
<p>From One Small Seed a Forest is Born also provides important information about plant associations with fauna and fungi. We are confident in saying that there has yet to be a book published in Australia that conveys with such clarity the interrelationships present in Australia's land eco-systems. </p>
<p>Neville’s work has been ably assisted by an advisory group formed in Feb 2018 to support him to bring the book to publication. It is believed that this collaborative ‘citizen science’ approach to producing a field guide is quite unique. </p>
<p>This book will be the ideal companion for plant enthusiasts, those eager to protect and restore Australia’s ecosystems or travellers who want to know about our landscapes as they explore this great wide land.   </p>

By supplementing the farmers’ income with an alternative occupation, we increase income levels. According to recent records from the Amani Butterfly Project Report, an increase of 25% in income was indicated for participating butterfly farmers. This vastly improves the quality of life for individuals, allowing children to attend school and for families to be able to pay for secondary school. </p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1352706/files/20150403114335-SDBZ_analysis.png?1428086615"" src="""" style=""width: 574.137px; height: 338px;""/></p><br/><p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src="""" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>When asked about what benefits they had received from butterfly farming, one farmer stated, “We are living a good life in my family. I have bought a bicycle, I have bricks, I have bought the grills for the windows of my house, iron sheets, and timber. I am able to pay school fees for my children.” (Farm Radio International, 2009).</p><p>By giving them all the tools they need to succeed, from production materials such as equipment and training, to business tools such as business classes and workshops, we empower these communities to become financially successful and independent.</p><p>2. Community development. As a community co-op, we aim to reduce attrition from the program by allocating ten percent of sales to community projects which will be chosen by local members of the co-op community. This investment back into the community ensures that the implementation of the butterfly farms will be not only smooth, but also beneficial to all members of the community regardless of their participation.</p><p>3.  Reduce the need of third world communities to deplete their natural resources and destroy biodiversity. By providing farmers with an alternative income, we reduce the need for slash and burn farming.The environmentally friendly production of butterflies demands that habitats be in as pristine condition as possible. </p><p>Below image taken from :""Butterfly farming and conservation behavior in the East Usambara Mountains of Tanzania"" by Theron Morgan-Brown, 2007.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1352701/files/20150403114151-SDBZ_farmers_opinions.png?1428086511"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src="""" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>This need for pristine environments encourages locals to halt deforestation or even reverse the damage that has been done because the farmers increased income is dependent upon this pristine environment.

This co-op will be established with the target size of around 60 to 80 participating butterfly farmers. We anticipate that at the start of our co-op a 40 to 50 percent participation rate will indicate successful dissemination into the community, as well as positive reception of the co-op, paving the way for success. </p><p>We aim to benefit the community directly, as 10 percent of pupae sales income will be invested in community improvement projects. Other successful projects have shown that as the success of the butterfly farming becomes more obvious, the community support grows within the first two to three years to encompass 80 to 90 percent of the families. </p><p>Within two years after the initiation of our first co-op, we intend to take our experience to two additional communities, bringing the positive economic and environmental impacts to new communities. Therefore, we plan to triple our economic, community, and environmental impacts within two year of initiation. Within two years, the breadth of our impact will increase dramatically. However, our focus is to impact a few individuals and communities at an extraordinarily deep level by improving their quality of life.</p><p>Our plan after several successful butterfly farming co-ops is our domestic social impact. This involves the inception of the San Diego Butterfly Zoo cultural and environmental center, which will exhibit many of the beautiful butterflies that our co-op farmers produce.

Domestically we are establishing a live entomology education and cultural center in San Diego County to increase environmental and cultural awareness. In our co-op communities the needs we are trying to meet include the need for a reliable income that is sustainable, renewable and not reliant upon the destruction of natural resources, the need for an infrastructure that provides the opportunity for social and economic growth, and the need for entrepreneurial empowerment.1.  Create a sustainable income for third world communities through the implementation of a butterfly farming Co-op. By supplementing the farmers’ income with an alternative occupation, we increase income levels. According to recent records from the Amani Butterfly Project Report, an increase of 25% in income was indicated for participating butterfly farmers. This vastly improves the quality of life for individuals, allowing children to attend school and for families to be able to pay for secondary school. When asked about what benefits they had received from butterfly farming, one farmer stated, “We are living a good life in my family. I have bought a bicycle, I have bricks, I have bought the grills for the windows of my house, iron sheets, and timber. I am able to pay school fees for my children.” (Farm Radio International, 2009).By giving them all the tools they need to succeed, from production materials such as equipment and training, to business tools such as business classes and workshops, we empower these communities to become financially successful and independent.2. Community development. As a community co-op, we aim to reduce attrition from the program by allocating ten percent of sales to community projects which will be chosen by local members of the co-op community. This investment back into the community ensures that the implementation of the butterfly farms will be not only smooth, but also beneficial to all members of the community regardless of their participation.3.  Reduce the need of third world communities to deplete their natural resources and destroy biodiversity. By providing farmers with an alternative income, we reduce the need for slash and burn farming.The environmentally friendly production of butterflies demands that habitats be in as pristine condition as possible. Below image taken from :""Butterfly farming and conservation behavior in the East Usambara Mountains of Tanzania"" by Theron Morgan-Brown, 2007.This need for pristine environments encourages locals to halt deforestation or even reverse the damage that has been done because the farmers increased income is dependent upon this pristine environment. This creates an economic incentive to conserve.We plan on establishing our first co-op within the first 8 months of operation. This co-op will be established with the target size of around 60 to 80 participating butterfly farmers. We anticipate that at the start of our co-op a 40 to 50 percent participation rate will indicate successful dissemination into the community, as well as positive reception of the co-op, paving the way for success. We aim to benefit the community directly, as 10 percent of pupae sales income will be invested in community improvement projects. Other successful projects have shown that as the success of the butterfly farming becomes more obvious, the community support grows within the first two to three years to encompass 80 to 90 percent of the families. Within two years after the initiation of our first co-op, we intend to take our experience to two additional communities, bringing the positive economic and environmental impacts to new communities. Therefore, we plan to triple our economic, community, and environmental impacts within two year of initiation. Within two years, the breadth of our impact will increase dramatically. However, our focus is to impact a few individuals and communities at an extraordinarily deep level by improving their quality of life.Our plan after several successful butterfly farming co-ops is our domestic social impact. This involves the inception of the San Diego Butterfly Zoo cultural and environmental center, which will exhibit many of the beautiful butterflies that our co-op farmers produce. The goal of this facility complements that of the co-ops, in that it intends to have a positive impact upon great number of visitors.By bringing the tropical rainforest directly to the public, the SDBZ is designed to spark visitors’ interest in the role insects play on a global scale. Direct contact with a variety of tropical insects enables visitors to interact with species they otherwise would not have known existed. Contained within the center are a state of the art Live Butterfly Pavilion with over 6,000 square feet of tropical plants and butterflies, a Live Arthropod Lab viewable by the public and utilized for breeding and research programs, and an additional room for offered classes as well as for rental by third parties. Permitting: The cost of a USDA annual license is 100USD. Individual permits costs vary from country to country, and are dependent on the number of shipments made.Foreign export annual permits, depending upon the country, range from 40-200USD.Equipment procurement: Butterfly cage costs ~20.00 USD each. With the goal of establishing a community of 60 farmers that puts us at around 1,200 USD.Assorted equipment, including planting bags, hanging traps, sweep nets, packing supplies, butterfly breeding literature for reference, etc. We estimate this at around 400-700USD.Access to the community: Airfare, vehicle rental, local guide. Airfare averages 2,000USD per person to proposed rural communities. It is assumed that two trips will need to be made, one to introduce the idea to the community and confirm the feasibility in the region. And a second trip to bring supplies and set up the co-op. With two team members traveling twice that puts us at around 8,000 USD in airfare alone.Shipping costs: Cost of renting and transporting shipment containers with start up materials. This includes all transportation from start to finish.Examples of shipment costs for one 20’ container from San Diego Port to:Port Noire, Congo Africa ~8,000 USDPort Moresby, Papua New Guinea ~5,000 USDWe are estimating our costs at around 20,000 USD to get our first co-op up and running. There are always unexpected costs however so we are setting our funding goal for 25,000 USD in the hopes that we will have the funding to ensure a successful first venture. Not only are we reaching out through crowd sourcing but we are also semi-finalists in the University of San Diego’s Social Innovation Challenge, a competition like Shark Tank, in which teams of social entrepreneurs compete for mentorship and a portion of $75,000 in seed funding to help make their ventures a reality. The finalists will be announced on April 10th so please stay tuned for that announcement!

</div></div>","What are Infinity Petbowls?INFINITY is an ergonomically designed pet bowl for cats and dogs at an affordable price!From a Puppy or a Kitten to an Adult pet, this specially design tool-less T-Slot system and its matching bowl holders will allow modern dogs and cats to enjoy their food at a convenient height. The Bowl holder can be adjusted from 3” to 8” secured by its aluminum thumb screw. The INFINITY is made of a composite plastic holder and non corrosive aluminum frame. Additionally, it includes removable stainless steel bowls.    San Francisco-based architect and designer EJ Tanu founded DripModule in 2011 to create modern goods that would appeal to people and their pets. Starting in the Bay Area at Tech Shop, he incorporated rapid prototyping methods and used materials primarily sourced from U.S. manufacturers. After successfully running a limited production company, he felt it wasn't enough and wanted to create a new product at a new level: A product with even more quality and usability offered at an affordable price. People say past experiences are invaluable assets and this proves to be true for Tanu and his company. Efficiency in prototyping and testing has made it possible to create our newest line of pet bowls, Infinity. We have obtained a high demand for it but need funding to start it's production. First test cut is using a wood simulation on CNC machine to see if the design and proportion is working, then rough mock-up is developed.A more detailed mock-up is produced to test it's stability and refine it's materials.Early Mock-up version

<p>The <i>Himalayan
Rocket Stove</i> will revolutionise heating and cooking in the Himalayas
by providing highly efficient stove technology. We aim to stem the tragic loss of trees &amp; intense
deforestation that is a result of ever-growing demand on wood for heating
and cooking, due to increasing population.</p>
<p>These days telecommunication is part of everyday life for the average Himalayan family. Mobile phone technology allows people to stay connected to each other in ways that was previously impossible. Our stretch goal is to develop a phone
charging and LED lighting kit that will work directly from the heat of the stove. In remote regions where the power supply is unreliable and
often non-existent throughout the winter months this will be invaluable. </p>
<p><b><i>Based on fuel consumption figures, each Himalayan Rocket Stove in the field saves 1 mature tree from being felled each and every year of operation. Our stoves are built to last at least 7 years of continuous operation and longer with servicing.</i></b></p>

<p>We will do this in India, creating local employment at all stages of the process, from manufacture to distribution to sales and service. </p>
<p>Four groups have been identified as the most in need and least able to afford efficient heating solutions so we will donate stoves funded by this project to these groups. <br/></p>

<h3><br/></h3>
<h3>What is a Himalayan Rocket Stove?</h3> <p></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">Most heating and cooking in the Himalayas is done on basic wood combustion
stoves which consume large amounts of wood and where most of the heat exits via
the chimney and is lost, creating lots of smoke and CO2 emissions. </span><br/></p>
<p>The efficiency
rating of these basic combustion stoves is around 15%, which means that
85% of the energy generated in the combustion process is lost. </p>
<p>A 'Rocket Stove' is an innovative design that uses small sticks and wood in a combustion process that is highly efficient, burning cleanly at high temperatures releasing large amounts of heat energy that can be effectively used in multiple ways.<br/></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1463104829/rocket-design-1_nvfnhf.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/>
<p><b><i>In a Rocket Stove, efficiency is around 90% effective use of energy, with minimal losses to the atmosphere. </i></b></p>
<p>This stove is designed to meet the needs of
a typical Himalayan family. We are calling
it the <b><i>Himalayan Rocket Stove</i></b> to distinguish it from other variations
on rocket stove designs that already exist. </p>
<p>Small sticks and wood are the preferred
fuel source, and in many regions these are available in sustainable amounts
that don’t require felling mature trees. </p>
<p><i><b>Legally and illegally harvested timber is decimating the grand forests of fir, cedar and deodar that cover the mountain sides of the lower Himalayas. </b></i></p>
<p>Rocket stoves are <i>relatively</i> simple to make, yet have very
specific design parameters in order to be effective.
Our challenge was making one low to the ground so as to be accessible for cooking from a seated position.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1463104749/woman_in_kitchen_ux4lwt.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>After 2 years of research and prototyping, we have now managed to complete a design that works with our particular set of criteria. </p>
<p><i><b>This project will manufacture and deliver highly efficient fuel stoves to the people of the Himalayas where they are most needed.</b></i></p>
<br/>
<p></p>
<h3>What makes the Himalayan Rocket Stove special?</h3>
<p>The <b>Himalayan Rocket Stove</b> in its final form combines four features into one unit, with many associated benefits.</p>
<p>1. Cooking Surface<br/>2. Room Heating<br/>3. Water Heating<br/>4. Phone Charging and Lighting (optional extras - based on reaching our stretch goals)</p>
<p>Our design will appeal to
villagers in the Himalayas as it easily fits into the space currently
allocated to their traditional style of stove, and yet offers greatly improved efficiency that will reduce their fuel demand by a factor of 4 to 5
times.</p>
<p>We will integrate a water jacket into the design
that will allow for water to be heated and drawn off on demand, or left in the
heater to act as a heat bank that will radiate into the room after the fire has
gone out.  </p>
<p>Small thermo-electric generator (TEG) modules will generate small amounts of current, sufficient to charge a mobile phone and power LED lights fixed to the stove.</p>
<p></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<h3>Benefits to Himalayan families and environment</h3>
<p>There are so many benefits to this kind of stove being used in the Himalayan context beyond just heating and cooking. The main benefits are listed below:</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1463543914/himachal-stove-400_cufgxs.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<div>
<p></p>
<p><strong>1. Use less wo</strong><b>od</b>. We estimate that for every single Himalayan Rocket Stove installed in the community, we will save 1 mature Himalayan tree from being felled each year! </p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1463543958/forest-and-wood-400_jibat7.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/>
<p><strong>2. Save money and environment</strong>. The average family uses 1-2 cords of wood per season. It takes a tree with a 22 inch diameter at breast height (that's a mid sized mature tree) to make 1 cord of wood. So each family is using the equivalent of 1 or 2 trees each season. That costs money and the environment, and is profoundly unsustainable. <br/></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1463544050/1-cord-wood-400_bvoztg.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/>
</div>
<p><strong>3. Save time. </strong>If the family is sourcing their own wood (which most do) it takes many hours in a week to collect all the wood requirements for heating and cooking. In preparation for the long, cold, snowed in winters of most regions this work is usually done by the women and children of the household during the summer months. This is time that could otherwise be spent more enjoyably in other activities. </p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1463544255/young-girl-400_qkeurr.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/>
<p><b>4. Reduced loads saves backs</b>. Since this stove prefers smaller twigs and sticks, many of which grow sustainably on local trees, the need to carry large logs over perilous terrain is vastly reduced. Collecting wood is a dangerous activity that requires continual foraging further afield to source wood supplies on steep mountain slopes. It also places incredible stresses on the body. Many older women are permanently stooped as a result of years of carrying heavy loads. </p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1463546430/old-woman-400_ohvxp1.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/>
<p><b>5. Sustainable harvesting.</b> In the current way of gathering wood, large branches are being cut faster than they can grow back and trees have started dying off. Mature trees are being felled and not replaced due to soil erosion, grazing and other factors. With this stove, small branches that grow back each year can be harvested sustainably. </p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1463544382/deforestation-2-400_jsgrxd.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/>
<p></p>
<div>
<strong>6. Hot water on tap</strong>. Most families still heat water either on their stoves, or on a separate fire outside the house. As a result, hot water for washing or for cleaning dishes in the evenings is either inconvenient or simply not available at all. Our system will provide 20 - 30L of hot water as a byproduct of heating and cooking each evening, rather than having to separately heat up a pot outside in the summer or often not at all during the snowy winters. </div>
<div>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1463544408/cooking-pot-on-fire-400_rngn52.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/><p></p>
<p><strong>7. Phone charging and light</strong>. With the water and power module installed, the Himalayan Rocket Stove will provide light from the attached LED lamp, as well as phone charging for multiple handsets. This feature will be very useful where electrical power is often sporadic &amp; will be included as an optional extra for those in need. </p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1463544548/phone-charging-400_hmghed.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/>
<p><strong>8. Clean air.</strong> In the winter wood smoke pollutes the fresh mountain air of the valleys of the Himalayas, and adds to respiratory issues. Our system burns so cleanly that there is only a small amount of smoke during the first 5 - 10 minutes of lighting up, after which there is no visible sign of smoke.</p>

<h3>What we need to proceed</h3>
<p>The development process is made up of 4 main parts:</p>
<b style=""background-color: initial;""><ol>
<li>
<b style=""background-color: initial;"">Prototyping</b><span style=""background-color: initial;""> (currently well underway in Australia)</span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<b style=""background-color: initial;"">Testing</b><span style=""background-color: initial;""> (build and install multiple units in India for winter season deep testing) </span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<b style=""background-color: initial;"">Production</b><span style=""background-color: initial;""> (design and establish the mass production process in India)</span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<b style=""background-color: initial;"">Distribution</b><span style=""background-color: initial;""> (set up distribution networks into the remote regions where they are needed the most)</span><br/>
</li>
</ol></b><ul>
</ul>
<p>I am currently at the end of Phase 1 with prototypes currently in local testing phase. The results so far are very promising, with a working unit ready to model our Indian test units on.</p>
<p>I am ready to go to the next phase where multiple test units will be built in India and installed into various situations in different parts of the Himalayas (with differing parameters) and their performance monitored throughout the winter. </p>
<p><i>With this crowdfunding campaign, we will be able make enough units in our first season of production to get them out to schools, nunneries and needy monasteries throughout the Himalayan region, &amp; as well make more available to low income families. </i></p>

</div>
</div><div>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>There are approximately 10 million households (with an average 5 occupants) in the Indian and Nepalese Himalayas. Most of which use wood stoves in some capacity, either for cooking, heating or both. </p>
<p>Even if we only count 10% of this potential market as being viable, that's 1 million households, not counting schools, nunneries and monasteries of which there are many thousands. </p> <ul> <li>1 million households burning wood inefficiently equates to 1+ million mature Himalayan trees per year being consumed unnecessarily. </li> <li>For each 1% of these households where we replace their stoves, that's 10,000 Himalayan Rocket Stoves saving on average 10,000 trees per year.</li>
<li>Means there will be more families with more funds for food and education, cleaner air, less health risks and greater self reliability.</li> <li>Over the lifetime of this project, our aim is to make high efficiency fuel stoves the norm, saving millions of trees and supporting a better quality of life for the people of the mountains. </li> </ul> </div> <div> <h3></h3>

<br/><h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>Having worked and travelled in Himalayan India on and off over the previous 25 years, mostly in the travel and tourism sector, I am familiar with working in India and some of the challenges that presents.</p>
<p><b>Challenges</b></p> <ul> <li>
<b>Doing business in India.</b> It will be a legal requirement to go into business in India that we will need to do so as a Joint Venture, requiring an Indian partner in the local production business. I have several contacts to follow up in this regard. </li> <li>
<b>Competition and duplication. </b>We encourage imitation over the long term, for all of the associated wider benefits to the people and environment that will result from a wider uptake of this technology. We need to prove to the market the benefits of these stoves, making sure our stoves are effective and long lasting, otherwise there is potential for backlash and resistance to develop.  </li>
<li>
<b style=""background-color: initial;"">Production.</b><span style=""background-color: initial;""> India has very well established manufacturing and industrial facilities which we will be looking to collaborate with in the short term. In the long term we will set up our own manufacturing plant for ongoing production. </span>
</li>
<li>
<b>Distribution. </b>The Himalayan regions we are targeting are vast, intricate and home to many culturally distinct subgroups, many of whom do not travel to large centralised ""shopping nodes"" on a regular basis. Our plan is to take the stoves to them, employing locals in our distribution network. </li>
</ul>
<div><br/></div>
<div>
<h3>Perks Explained</h3>
<p>We are offering several options for supporting this project. All funds will go towards making and distributing stoves. </p>
<p><b>1. Everyone ($10 and up)</b> who supports us goes onto the email list and will be kept up to date with progress. You can leave this list at anytime. </p>
<p><b>2. Everyone from $45</b> and up will also receive a personalised hand drawn certificate of appreciation from the kids of Serkong School in Tabo. </p>
<p><b>3. Everyone from $90</b> and up will also receive an email with links and information to try your own rocket stove projects. Great for kids and also adults with an interest in this amazing technology. There will be various projects for different levels of expertise. </p>
<p><b>4. At $280</b> - you will be subsidising the production and sale of a stove to a low income family.

The
Himalayan Rocket Stove is a simple, effective and efficient method for burning
wood. This method is clean and the impact on the environment is minimal. Best
of all this technology already exists and has been proven to work, but
until now, has not been adapted to Himalayan conditions.
We are at this moment able to offer a
single unit that will heat a room, heat water, and serve as a large cooktop simultaneously.


The Himalayan
Rocket Stove will revolutionise heating and cooking in the Himalayas
by providing highly efficient stove technology. We aim to stem the tragic loss of trees & intense
deforestation that is a result of ever-growing demand on wood for heating
and cooking, due to increasing population.
These days telecommunication is part of everyday life for the average Himalayan family. Mobile phone technology allows people to stay connected to each other in ways that was previously impossible. Our stretch goal is to develop a phone
charging and LED lighting kit that will work directly from the heat of the stove. In remote regions where the power supply is unreliable and
often non-existent throughout the winter months this will be invaluable. 
Based on fuel consumption figures, each Himalayan Rocket Stove in the field saves 1 mature tree from being felled each and every year of operation. Our stoves are built to last at least 7 years of continuous operation and longer with servicing.





What is this project actually funding?
We have been fortunate to receive a grant from a charitable trust that recognised the valuable contribution this project offers the Himalayan region.
This means we will be able to go into production later this year with our first viable prototype for field assessment. 
We will do this in India, creating local employment at all stages of the process, from manufacture to distribution to sales and service. 
Four groups have been identified as the most in need and least able to afford efficient heating solutions so we will donate stoves funded by this project to these groups. 
Funds raised via this campaign will go directly towards getting Himalayan Rocket Stoves out to schools, nunneries and needy monasteries throughout the Himalayan region, as well as to low income families.



Our initial production run will serve as a test for ongoing and larger production runs in coming years, with the ultimate goal of saving thousands of trees in the Himalayas. That's a lot of carbon that won't end up as smoke in the atmosphere, and a lot backs that will benefit from the greatly reduced loads they will carry. 



What is a Himalayan Rocket Stove? 
Most heating and cooking in the Himalayas is done on basic wood combustion
stoves which consume large amounts of wood and where most of the heat exits via
the chimney and is lost, creating lots of smoke and CO2 emissions. 
The efficiency
rating of these basic combustion stoves is around 15%, which means that
85% of the energy generated in the combustion process is lost. 
A 'Rocket Stove' is an innovative design that uses small sticks and wood in a combustion process that is highly efficient, burning cleanly at high temperatures releasing large amounts of heat energy that can be effectively used in multiple ways.



In a Rocket Stove, efficiency is around 90% effective use of energy, with minimal losses to the atmosphere. 
This stove is designed to meet the needs of
a typical Himalayan family. We are calling
it the Himalayan Rocket Stove to distinguish it from other variations
on rocket stove designs that already exist. 
Small sticks and wood are the preferred
fuel source, and in many regions these are available in sustainable amounts
that don’t require felling mature trees. 
Legally and illegally harvested timber is decimating the grand forests of fir, cedar and deodar that cover the mountain sides of the lower Himalayas. 
Rocket stoves are relatively simple to make, yet have very
specific design parameters in order to be effective.
Our challenge was making one low to the ground so as to be accessible for cooking from a seated position.


After 2 years of research and prototyping, we have now managed to complete a design that works with our particular set of criteria. 
This project will manufacture and deliver highly efficient fuel stoves to the people of the Himalayas where they are most needed.


What makes the Himalayan Rocket Stove special?
The Himalayan Rocket Stove in its final form combines four features into one unit, with many associated benefits.
1. Cooking Surface2. Room Heating3. Water Heating4. Phone Charging and Lighting (optional extras - based on reaching our stretch goals)
Our design will appeal to
villagers in the Himalayas as it easily fits into the space currently
allocated to their traditional style of stove, and yet offers greatly improved efficiency that will reduce their fuel demand by a factor of 4 to 5
times.
We will integrate a water jacket into the design
that will allow for water to be heated and drawn off on demand, or left in the
heater to act as a heat bank that will radiate into the room after the fire has
gone out.  
Small thermo-electric generator (TEG) modules will generate small amounts of current, sufficient to charge a mobile phone and power LED lights fixed to the stove.



Benefits to Himalayan families and environment
There are so many benefits to this kind of stove being used in the Himalayan context beyond just heating and cooking. The main benefits are listed below:





1. Use less wood. We estimate that for every single Himalayan Rocket Stove installed in the community, we will save 1 mature Himalayan tree from being felled each year! 




2. Save money and environment. The average family uses 1-2 cords of wood per season. It takes a tree with a 22 inch diameter at breast height (that's a mid sized mature tree) to make 1 cord of wood. So each family is using the equivalent of 1 or 2 trees each season. That costs money and the environment, and is profoundly unsustainable. 





3. Save time. If the family is sourcing their own wood (which most do) it takes many hours in a week to collect all the wood requirements for heating and cooking. In preparation for the long, cold, snowed in winters of most regions this work is usually done by the women and children of the household during the summer months. This is time that could otherwise be spent more enjoyably in other activities. 





4. Reduced loads saves backs. Since this stove prefers smaller twigs and sticks, many of which grow sustainably on local trees, the need to carry large logs over perilous terrain is vastly reduced. Collecting wood is a dangerous activity that requires continual foraging further afield to source wood supplies on steep mountain slopes. It also places incredible stresses on the body. Many older women are permanently stooped as a result of years of carrying heavy loads. 




5. Sustainable harvesting. In the current way of gathering wood, large branches are being cut faster than they can grow back and trees have started dying off. Mature trees are being felled and not replaced due to soil erosion, grazing and other factors. With this stove, small branches that grow back each year can be harvested sustainably. 







6. Hot water on tap. Most families still heat water either on their stoves, or on a separate fire outside the house. As a result, hot water for washing or for cleaning dishes in the evenings is either inconvenient or simply not available at all. Our system will provide 20 - 30L of hot water as a byproduct of heating and cooking each evening, rather than having to separately heat up a pot outside in the summer or often not at all during the snowy winters. 




7. Phone charging and light. With the water and power module installed, the Himalayan Rocket Stove will provide light from the attached LED lamp, as well as phone charging for multiple handsets. This feature will be very useful where electrical power is often sporadic & will be included as an optional extra for those in need. 




8. Clean air. In the winter wood smoke pollutes the fresh mountain air of the valleys of the Himalayas, and adds to respiratory issues. Our system burns so cleanly that there is only a small amount of smoke during the first 5 - 10 minutes of lighting up, after which there is no visible sign of smoke.






What we need to proceed
The development process is made up of 4 main parts:


Prototyping (currently well underway in Australia)


Testing (build and install multiple units in India for winter season deep testing) 


Production (design and establish the mass production process in India)


Distribution (set up distribution networks into the remote regions where they are needed the most)



I am currently at the end of Phase 1 with prototypes currently in local testing phase. The results so far are very promising, with a working unit ready to model our Indian test units on.
I am ready to go to the next phase where multiple test units will be built in India and installed into various situations in different parts of the Himalayas (with differing parameters) and their performance monitored throughout the winter. 
With this crowdfunding campaign, we will be able make enough units in our first season of production to get them out to schools, nunneries and needy monasteries throughout the Himalayan region, & as well make more available to low income families. 
Every Stove Saves 1 Tree Every Year





    The Impact There are approximately 10 million households (with an average 5 occupants) in the Indian and Nepalese Himalayas. Most of which use wood stoves in some capacity, either for cooking, heating or both. 
Even if we only count 10% of this potential market as being viable, that's 1 million households, not counting schools, nunneries and monasteries of which there are many thousands.   1 million households burning wood inefficiently equates to 1+ million mature Himalayan trees per year being consumed unnecessarily.  For each 1% of these households where we replace their stoves, that's 10,000 Himalayan Rocket Stoves saving on average 10,000 trees per year.
Means there will be more families with more funds for food and education, cleaner air, less health risks and greater self reliability. Over the lifetime of this project, our aim is to make high efficiency fuel stoves the norm, saving millions of trees and supporting a better quality of life for the people of the mountains.     

Risks & Challenges Having worked and travelled in Himalayan India on and off over the previous 25 years, mostly in the travel and tourism sector, I am familiar with working in India and some of the challenges that presents.
Challenges  
Doing business in India. It will be a legal requirement to go into business in India that we will need to do so as a Joint Venture, requiring an Indian partner in the local production business. I have several contacts to follow up in this regard.  
Competition and duplication. We encourage imitation over the long term, for all of the associated wider benefits to the people and environment that will result from a wider uptake of this technology. We need to prove to the market the benefits of these stoves, making sure our stoves are effective and long lasting, otherwise there is potential for backlash and resistance to develop.  

Production. India has very well established manufacturing and industrial facilities which we will be looking to collaborate with in the short term. In the long term we will set up our own manufacturing plant for ongoing production. 


Distribution. The Himalayan regions we are targeting are vast, intricate and home to many culturally distinct subgroups, many of whom do not travel to large centralised ""shopping nodes"" on a regular basis. Our plan is to take the stoves to them, employing locals in our distribution network. 



Perks Explained
We are offering several options for supporting this project. All funds will go towards making and distributing stoves. 
1. Everyone ($10 and up) who supports us goes onto the email list and will be kept up to date with progress. You can leave this list at anytime. 
2. Everyone from $45 and up will also receive a personalised hand drawn certificate of appreciation from the kids of Serkong School in Tabo. 
3. Everyone from $90 and up will also receive an email with links and information to try your own rocket stove projects. Great for kids and also adults with an interest in this amazing technology. There will be various projects for different levels of expertise. 
4. At $280 - you will be subsidising the production and sale of a stove to a low income family. This will be assessed by locals who know and understand the subtle politics within each region. The reason we don't give units away to families is due to the well understood phenomenon that something for free is not valued, and would devalue the whole project in the eyes of recipients. Personalised photo with your recipient family will be sent to you via email.
5. At $360 - we can afford to give a complete stove to an institution in need (schools and nunneries in particular are needy, as well as some poorly funded monasteries). By giving to these institutions, we don't devalue the project in the community, as it is well accepted to give gifts and charity to these institutions. Personalised photo with your recipient class / nuns / monks will be sent to you via email.
6. At $1080 - we know that many of you have had your own experiences and made connections in the Himalayas, and this is a way to give directly to the places / people you have that connection with. We can afford to deliver 3 units with a personal message from you for this amount, and take a personalised photo with your recipients to be sent back to you via email. If you don't have a particular destination in mind, and still want to use this perk, we will choose a suitable needy destination for you, and still send you the personalised photo showing you where your stoves ended up. 
7. At $5000 - for those who want to come and see the stoves in action in the field. Out of these funds 50% will go directly to the Himalayan Rocket Stove project, and the rest will go towards funding your expenses-paid journey to the Himalayas with Yak Trak - unique journeys (owned and operated by Russell Collins). You will need to cover your flights to India, your travel insurance, visa and other travel details, while your journey in India will be fully funded from Delhi airport onwards in comfort and style.

</div></div>","Preserve Monroe is a coalition of landowners, residents, businesses and organizations in Monroe County, WV. Preserve Monroe encourages citizens to participate in the responsible stewardship of our resources to assure the healthy and prosperous future of Monroe County and our families.

Preserve Monroe opposes the attempt by private corporations to build large, 42-inch interstate transmission pipelines through our county. These pipelines would cut across our mountains, streams and farmlands carrying natural gas to points east and overseas. We are united by concern that these large excavation and construction projects—as well as the long-term presence of high-pressure gas pipelines of this magnitude—are a very real threat to our water, to our families and community, and to our property values and landowner rights.Preserve Monroe welcomes all who love Monroe County. Join us today !PRESERVE MONROE COUNTY FROM INTERSTATE PIPELINES:Two large, interstate pipelines are being proposed to transport natural gas from the Marcellus shale operations in northwestern West Virginia to major interconnector lines in Virginia. In the case of one (Mountain Valley Pipeline), the pipeline is expected to be 42 inches in diameter, capable of transporting 2 billion cubic feet of gas per day. It would require 75 feet of permanent easement, with 125 feet easements for construction. This pipeline has NOT been approved yet. It is at the beginning of an extensive review process by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC).3 REASONS Why Monroe County Landowners Are Saying “NO”1. Threats to Our Water Supply2. Dangers to Our Families and Community3. Reduced Property Values / Loss of Landowner RightsIt’s Pain, No Gain for Monroe County

Why we need your contribution:



Preserve Monroe is a dedicated group of volunteers who are devoting their time and energy to furthering the goal of stopping the pipeline. The funds we raise will be used to pay for the following, as well as other costs associated with fighting the Mountain Valley Pipeline and preserving our unique county.


Public Awareness Campaigns- County-wide Every Door Direct Mailing campaigns- Announcements in local newspapers- Public meeting hall rentals (where applicable)- Steering Committee weekly meeting space- Preserve Monroe phone line



Administrative Fees- Website domain name fee- Web-hosting fee- WV annual business registration fee


General Consumable Supplies- External hard drives to store information- Dvd's for videos and photos (for landowners, FERC, USFS, etc)- Legal advice- Sign-making materials- Home printing paper and ink (some volunteers can afford to donate, others need to be reimbursed)- Professional printing- Postage stamps, envelopes

<p>The luscious TierraLuz eco community is a beautiful span of green land pressed up against jungle. The community members have various stunning views of jungle and ocean. Common areas are being developed to contribute to their collaborative, sustainable practices. They are currently in the middle of development. To further develop and maintain the community, a donation fund has been created. Sayulita ECO RETREATS will donate $20 USD to this fund for every perk sold involving the TierraLuz tour.

</p><p>The Costa Verde International School runs solely on fundraisers and donations. Their small school environment is mostly open to nature with the food they eat for lunch growing around them. The students' learning environment is one big sustainable system and truly amazing to comprehend. Andy Slavin, Costa Verde International School Director, will provide you with a tour of their systems and share the sustainable values and practices they teach the students. Andy has over 20 years of experience in education. Before this position, he was the Principal of the Green School in Bali, Indonesia. He has much to share about sustainable processes and eco friendly practices.

Is your counter-top made by local artisans or was it imported from another country?  Do you know where your veggies come from?  How about your eggs or cheese...fish or other meats? Keep your own bees and make your honey?  Dehydrate and can your own food. We may be doing this. Maybe not all on our own, but as a thriving community. Our eco community ideas are still coming together. And we want to show you how we do this and why it is important!</p>
<p><strong>Risks &amp; Challenges</strong></p>
<p>We have done our homework with the industry trends, location and the direction our future is taking us. Sayulita ECO RETREATS combines the industries within today’s leading trends: Tourism and Wellness. In addition, the project serves the public’s interests to learn about sustainability and take more meaningful action. This is referred to as Ecotourism or Sustainable Tourism. To make it accessible, Mexico is an ideal location. It is a common personal or business retreat location for North Americans. It is also one of the more affordable locations. This project is needed. More advocates are sharing the environmental changes we are going to be forced to deal with. If there is a time to come together and learn, it’s now. We want to create the space.</p>
<p>When Ron and I have shared our ideas within our networks, many have expressed their interest in our project. In fact, some have already visited Sayulita as a result of our discussions. There is no question there is interest in what we are doing and its benefits. There is also no question in our level of commitment. Personally, we have invested over $50,000 USD to this project. We have already grounded our commitment to make it happen, it is now time to build.</p>
<p>We are currently working on the designs of the property and structures. The eco-community members have been sharing their experience and knowledge to help us to succeed. There are a number of approvals we still need to receive through the eco-community and the Mexican government. Besides the building of the project, we are also learning a new culture and government system. We plan to continue to work towards our milestones and deal with unforeseen circumstances as they arise. We appreciate all the support we have received already. We hope you will join us and be the change.</p>

<p><b>About nPRES Consulting:</b> nPRES Consulting was established in Canada in 2013. The name stands for its values: natural performance, relationships, empowerment and sustainability. The business provides system-based process solutions to assist individuals, families, and businesses.The motivating services come in the form of consulting/coaching, developing learning/training and facilitating retreats. nPRES is currently creating retreats in Sayulita, Mexico.</p>
<p>Sayulita ECO RETREATS is an inspiring experience for individuals, families, schools, business leaders and teams looking for an opportunity to connect with nature and enhance their life/work practices in a sustainable way. Nature is its own teacher, and sometimes all you need is a space to reflect, discuss life/work enhancement ideas, and engage in activities and projects that unleash your own sustainable solutions. Why not also do it in a beautiful location like Sayulita, Mexico, where the sun is warm and sand is soft? Remove yourself from your day-to-day tension and distractions to fully experience alternative sustainable ideas that align your practices with your natural surroundings. Visit our website for upcoming opportunities: <a href=""http://www.sayulitaecoretreats.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.sayulitaecoretreats.com</a>.</p></div>","As Gandhi has inspired, we are being the change and invite you to join us. How can you make a difference in the world? One of the most empowering answers is - Change yourself! So we are. If you like our plan, we want to help you to do the same. Ron, my partner, and I have been inspired to help with some of today’s challenges (global warming, unsustainable practices, feeling disengaged and unenergetic, lack of confidence in our government system, etc.). We have taken the plunge to live lighter on Earth, feel healthier and enjoy life more. We started our change by joining an eco community called TierraLuz in Sayulita, Mexico (north of Puerto Vallarta). Together, the community members are creating sustainable processes to support a more tranquil environment that is in harmony with nature.

Does this idea appeal to you too? If so, GREAT! I think you will like what you will learn next… Ron and I plan to build a showcase eco home and training centre. The experience is to empower other like-minded individuals, families and organizations to experience and explore the change for themselves. The retreats will incorporate nature, community, eco friendly technology, sustainable processes and spirit. I have created this crowdfunding initiative to fund the Sayulita ECO RETREATS project. This project will be managed through a company I own called nPRES Consulting. See my bio below to learn more.

First Draft of the Property Layout
What do the perks include?
Special for this crowdfunding initiative, Sayulita ECO RETREATS will offer experiential opportunities to practice and explore eco living. Select your level of engagement.

Tours
Workshops
Retreats
Eco home rental

More details of these opportunities is provided below under Sayulita ECO RETREATS Crowdfunding Special Perks. There are also sponsorship opportunities for businesses who develop eco friendly, sustainable technology. See the Sponsorship section below.
Participate in this crowdfunding initiative and you will also be supporting a chain of sustainable efforts. There are others within the local community who are promoting sustainable practices that we support, such as the development of the TierraLuz eco community and a local eco school called Costa Verde International School. Money raised involving tours to this local community initiatives will result in a donation to their cause.
The luscious TierraLuz eco community is a beautiful span of green land pressed up against jungle. The community members have various stunning views of jungle and ocean. Common areas are being developed to contribute to their collaborative, sustainable practices. They are currently in the middle of development. To further develop and maintain the community, a donation fund has been created. Sayulita ECO RETREATS will donate $20 USD to this fund for every perk sold involving the TierraLuz tour.

The Costa Verde International School runs solely on fundraisers and donations. Their small school environment is mostly open to nature with the food they eat for lunch growing around them. The students' learning environment is one big sustainable system and truly amazing to comprehend. Andy Slavin, Costa Verde International School Director, will provide you with a tour of their systems and share the sustainable values and practices they teach the students. Andy has over 20 years of experience in education. Before this position, he was the Principal of the Green School in Bali, Indonesia. He has much to share about sustainable processes and eco friendly practices. Sayulita ECO RETREATS will donate $20 USD to the school for every perk sold involving the eco school tour.“Thousands of candles can be lighted from a single candle” – Buddha

Proposed Lot in TierraLuz
The property is located at the top of eco community with a view of the ocean and jungle. The eco-community is a 20-minute walk away from the soft, sandy beach near downtown Sayulita. The location is perfect because it is close enough to town to get there quickly with an electric golf cart, yet far enough to drown out the noise from the late night partying.Floor Plan for Eco-HomeWe have hired Jorge Siemen, Architecture and Design, to create the layout of the property structures. The image above is the first draft. The layout of the home has 3 bedrooms. It’s organized so that the whole home or individual suites can be rented out. The home and the training centre will balance the use of local and natural building materials (rocks/earth bags/etc.) and other creative solutions to meet home needs (e.g., solar energy, water waste systems, etc.) while minimizing costs. The training centre is located lower on the hill near the parking lot and can accommodate a maximum of 20 people. We are currently working through the sustainable processes, experimenting with options.
You may be familiar with recycling your glass/plastics/paper.  You may even drive an eco-friendly vehicle.  But does your home recycle rain water?  Is your bodily waste turned into compost?  Is your grey water redirected to a pond where it is naturally filtered to water your outdoor plants? Is your counter-top made by local artisans or was it imported from another country?  Do you know where your veggies come from?  How about your eggs or cheese...fish or other meats? Keep your own bees and make your honey?  Dehydrate and can your own food. We may be doing this. Maybe not all on our own, but as a thriving community. Our eco community ideas are still coming together. And we want to show you how we do this and why it is important!

There are a number of approvals we still need to receive through the eco-community and the Mexican government. Besides the building of the project, we are also learning a new culture and government system. We plan to continue to work towards our milestones and deal with unforeseen circumstances as they arise. We appreciate all the support we have received already. We hope you will join us and be the change.
Where will the money go? 
To the construction of the model eco home and training centre
To the start-up costs of Sayulita ECO RETREATS
Any money left-over will be invested to empower others who are working towards the same vision.

<p>My name is Daryl and I grew up in Country Victoria where I spent my
childhood years planning adventures that involved plenty of mechanical things
to maintain and repair such as motorbikes and motor vehicles etc.</p>
<p>My family always had an inventive and resourceful nature which I believe

working on this product for several years testing and developing many different
prototypes at different stages to achieve this latest product design.</p>

to its use is of considerable significance.</p>
<p>Following their arrival in Australia, introduced rodents have posed
detrimental impacts on native Australian fauna. Native marsupials and rodents
such as the Antechinus and New Holland Mouse have become diminished in
population size and have experienced a contracted distribution as a result of
the increased competition with the house mouse. According to the Australian
Government Canberra in their 1995 publication Action Plan for Australian
Rodents ""rodents account for half of Australia's mammal extinction since
European settlement"" indicating the dire situation of our native species
whose survival is further jeopardised by the continued use of toxic baiting. On
islands where house mice have been introduced, seabird colonies are often
effected as their eggs (and sometimes chicks) are eaten by the mice. Secondary
poisoning of birds, particularly raptors but also Magpie, Butcherbirds, Curlews
and Kookaburra is a significant concern. Bird-keepers are also detrimented by
problematic rodents which spoil seed, feast on eggs and attract snakes to their
aviaries. During Rodent plagues well known native predators such as the Kite,
Kestrel, Falcon and Hobby species will congregate and feed almost exclusively
off mice as they are easy prey in such numbers, as a result of this many raptor
unwittingly ingest baited mice and hence succumb to the same fate as their
prey. During these times it is not uncommon for wildlife carers to witness
raptors and the like being regularly bought in and dying from ingesting baited
mice. Reptiles are additionally known to suffer from ingesting poisoned baits
or poisoned animals as many of the current poisonous baits appear to be target
specific and hence may be taken by wildlife, livestock and pets.</p>

<p>Professional pest controller Daniel Watt who has over 20 years experience dealing with pests talks about MOUSEINATOR </p></strong><p></p><p><strong><br/></strong></p><p><strong>HOW IT WORKS -</strong></p>
<p>The Mouseinator uses an enclosed non
toxic baited area that has a teetering trap door arrangement secured and
triggered by a magnetic catch or locking device. The mouse enters the feeding
area through a small hole in the far end of the device and immediately steps
onto the end of the locked teetering platform applying a downward force onto
the magnetic catch and housing securing the platform. This ensures no sensation
of movement is felt by the mouse. The mouse then feels safe and travels along
the platform until it reaches the pivot point that has low friction axis to aid the swift operation of the
impending trapdoor effect. Past this point the pressure applied to the magnetic
catch end of the device changes to an upward force that will eventually release
the catch when the leverage force becomes great enough. The force increases as
the mass of the mouse moves along the platform towards the bait station until
it releases in a sudden movement. The mouse at this position on the platform
when the magnetic catch releases, ensures the force of its own weight drops the
platform rapidly from underneath with no chance of escape. The Platform is
designed so that various sizes and weight of mice release the catch at
different lengths across the platform as the leverage applied to the catch is
enough to initiate the release. The mouse then falls into a capturing cavity
area below the platform that is filled with vegetable oil (usually discarded
cooking oil) where it is captured and very quickly drowned. At the point in
which the mouse slides off the platform the weight is shifted slightly biased
towards the platforms original position so it returns to be locked by the
magnetic catch again. The trap is now automatically set again for the next
mouse. The specific gravity or relative density of the vegetable oil is such
that the mouse sinks quickly and is humanely destroyed. This dramatically
reduces the suffering of the mice as traditional poisoning can take 7 -10 days
to eventually exterminate a pest, a long drawn out suffering of the animal that
can even take longer if only a small amount of poison is consumed. The
Mouseinator can hold the captured dead rodents for extended periods of time due
to the preserving effect of the oil. I have also researched and developed a
totally natural stabilizer to extend the ability to preserve the captured
rodents for many months. This makes it ideal to use in a holiday home pantry or
situations where the trap may not be checked on a regular basis. I actually
have mice that were captured several years ago in oil with my additive that gives
off no noticeable offensive odour.</p>
<p> 

</p>
<p>Cost effective properties of this device
is extremely impressive as one of my prototypes has captured more than a
thousand mice and is several years old. It has no working parts that would
conceivably wear out in perhaps up to a several years of use. It could
conceivably capture tens of thousands of pests and still keep going. Compared
to chemical baiting that has much wastage and often non specific targeting of
pest animals etc, this device offers incredible value for pest suffering
reduction , environmental issues such as secondary poisoning of native species
and pets, chemical reduction in the food chain etc and real value for money for
the consumer that purchases the item.</p>

<p><strong>The Impact -</strong></p>
<p>The Mouseinator is aimed at reducing the suffering of native animals and
mice due to the reduction of poisonous baiting. It is also designed to reduce
toxic chemical use in the food chain. Native animals and pets should be further
protected by the elimination of secondary poisoning with this device. This
should impact on the environment in a positive way as well give an optimistic
outlook that as individuals we can make a positive contribution to the world
our future generations will inherit. </p>
<p>I have no track record in this particular area however I believe that it
is my fresh approach to design and researching the mice behaviour through infra
red video etc has been my strength in design, development and investigation of
a better way to humanely dispose of rodents. I plan to further surround myself
with a capable individuals throughout the business growth to succeed in the
market place. Any contributor to this project can be assured that they are
joining forces with an environmentally friendly business.</p>
<p>I have been unable to raise enough funds to complete this
project so far. I am now hoping the power of collective  individuals can
make a difference to the reduction of suffering of animals and reduction of
chemical use in the environment we live in.</p>
<p>If I am lucky enough to reach my
campaign goal,  any contributed funds
(excluding perks) over the target amount would be used directly towards providing
as many devices as possible, as a gift, to non profit community based groups.
This would be done on behalf of <u>all</u> my campaign contributors.</p>
<p>Worthy recipients such as volunteer fire
fighting organisations, surf rescue and life saving clubs, scouts and guide
groups, Senior citizens clubs and organisations, Country Women's and Men's
Groups, Town Hall Committees etc, would be offered these devices to show our
appreciation for their support given to the community.</p>
<p><strong>Risks &amp; Challenges with the Project
-</strong></p>
<p>There is of course a risk that I may fail with this project.</p>
<p>Having said that I have spent many years of hard work researching and developing this product and the most difficult obstacles are behind me. I have managed any risks and challenges I have had so far and I calculate and consider things carefully before acting on them. As the product develops I will seek assistance from talented individuals to produce and promote the product in the market place.</p>
<br/><p>
</p><p><strong>WHY SUPPORT THIS PRODUCT -</strong></p><p>
</p><p>Mice can cause considerable damage to the environment and with the toxic
methods currently being used to control their numbers there is risk to
secondary poisoning of native species and pets as well as toxic substances
being introduced into the food chain. These methods are also not particularly
humane and do not reflect most community expectations of how animals should be
treated during control of their numbers by human intervention. </p><p>
</p><p>According to a University of Nebraska publication for the United States
Department of Agriculture Wildlife Research Centre by Gary Witmer and William
Pitt ""Invasive Rodents in the United States'-</p><p>
</p><p>""House mice are native to southern Europe, northern Africa  and Asia. They now occur worldwide, including
Antarctica, and are probably the most numerous and widespread mammalian species
in the world next to humans. While house mice originated in the grasslands of
Central Asia, they have followed humans around the world as stowaways on ships.
They are very good invaders and probably reached to most parts of the world as
stowaways on ships and cargo. House mice have remarkable abilities that have
allowed them to be highly successful in many habitats around the world. Chief
among these are their reproductive potential and their adaptability in
different environments.</p><p>

House mice are small,
slender rodents with fur that is grayish brown above and gray to buff
underneath. This  small (maximum mass of
about 20 g for adults) and highly prolific animal is a  continuous breeder in many situations; a
female can produce 5-10 litters, each with 5-6 young, per year. The young
mature within about 3 weeks and soon become reproductively active. House mice
are short-lived (generally less than one year) and have high population
tum-over. In one study, 20 mice placed in an outdoor enclosure with abundant
food,  water, and cover, became a
population of 2,000 in eight months.</p><p>
</p><p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1448330626/vehzoqustlkjoq0rjmzr.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 276.58px;height: 361px;""/></p>
<p>House mice have amazing abilities which allow them to access almost any
available areas or resources.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>House mice cause many types of damage. A major concern is the
consumption and contamination of stored foods; it has been estimated that
substantial amounts of stored foods are lost each year in this manner. Mice
also consume and contaminate large amounts of livestock feed at animal
production facilities. While mice generally live in close proximity to humans,
sometimes feral populations occur. In these cases, the mice may damage many
types of crops in the field, especially com, cereal grains, and legun1es.
Australia has mouse ""plagues"" periodically resulting in enormous
losses to stored crops and crops in the field. In buildings, a mouse
infestation can be a considerable nuisance because of the noise, odours, and
droppings. More imp01tantly, they damage insulation and wiring. House
fires  have been caused by mice gnawing
electrical wires; likewise, 
communication systems have been shut down  for 
periods of time resulting in economic losses. Additionally,  house mice are susceptible to a large number
of disease agents and endo-parasites. </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Consequently, they serve as 
reservoirs  and vectors of disease
transmission to humans, pets, and livestock. lmportant among these  diseases 
are leptospirosis, plague, 
salmonella,  lymphocytic choriomeningitis,
and toxoplasmosis. Finally,  when
introduced to islands, mice can cause significant damage to natural resources,
including both flora and fauna. For example, on Gough Island and, mice fed on
nestling albatross chicks . Additionally, Witmer (unpubl. data) documented
seedling damage by house mice in a pen study. However, mice are subordinate to
introduced rats so the impacts of mice not noticed when  rats 
are  also  present 
on  the  island . 
This phenomenon  was demonstrated
by the large increase in mice abundance on Buck Island, USVI, after invasive
roof rats were eradicated.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>A large number of  methods and
materials  have been developed to  help solve 
house mouse problems. In general, the use of multiple approaches and
materials - integrated pest management- is more likely to reduce a mouse
problem to a tolerable level . The  tools
available and their proper use  have been
extensively reviewed (Brooks,  1973;
Prakash, 1988; Timm, 1994b; Corrigan, 2001).</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Rodenticides are widely used in the United States as well other parts of
the world. Both primary (direct consumption) and secondary hazards (consuming a
poisoned rodent or poisoned non-target animal) can occur to non-target animals
when rodenticides are used.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Rodenticides such as brodifacoum (a second generation anticoagulant) are
highly toxic, but also result in persistent residues in body tissues of animals
that consume poisoned rodents</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>There is a growing concern about the secondary effects of these residues
in predatory animals (e.g. , Thomas et aI. , 2011). </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Additional research is needed to improve existing methods and to develop
new methods for invasive rodent detection and control. More research is needed
in both lethal and nonlethal means of resolving rodent damage situations.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>A number of challenges remain with invasive rodent management and
eradication in the United States. Some of the challenges faced include the
public and agency concerns about the use of toxicants and traps, land access
(especially to private lands), public attitudes, resource availability, and
detection and monitoring difficulties. Nonetheless,  we 
will  hopefully  continue 
to  relieve  the 
burdens  on  insular 
and mainland ec.osystems caused by rodent introductions. The flora and
fauna of islands generally respond favourably and rapidly after invasive
rodents are removed. Endemic. threatened, or endangered species can be, and
have been, re-introduced after successful rodent eradications. For  example, 
the endangered St.  Croix  ground lizard 
(Ameiva  polops) was  recently re­ introduced to Buck Island in the
U.S. Virgin Islands after the successful eradication of roof rats. The recent
eradication of Polynesian rats and house mice from Cocos Island (a small island
off of Guam) set the stage for the re-introduction of the endangered Guam rail (flightless bird species). </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Invasive  rodents  will 
continue  to  pose 
challenges  to  land 
and  resource managers, commodity  producers, 
and  homeowners.  Many 
tools  are  available 
to  reduce  rodent populations and associated damage.
They should be used in a well thought out IPM approach.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Additionally,  seabird  populations, 
sea  turtle  populations 
and  other  island 
resources warrant protection from invasive rodents. The recovery of
fauna and flora on uninhabited islands 
after a successful  rodent
eradication is particularly notable. The significant impacts of introduced
rodents on native flora and fauna have been repeatedly demonstrated. Invasive
rodents are very adaptable, can exploit a wide array of resources as food and
cover, and can increase reproduction very quickly when and where  abundant 
resources  exist.  While 
invasive  rodents will continue to
pose challenges to land and resource managers, they can be controlled or even
eradicated with a well-planned and adequately-supported effort using
rodenticides and other tools. With proper planning, non-target losses  will be 1ninimal and these populations, along
with other island resources, will often recover quickly after the invasive
rodents have been removed.""  </p><p>

substantial amounts of stored foods are lost each year in this manner. Mice
also consume and contaminate large amounts of livestock feed at animal
production facilities. While mice generally live in close proximity to humans,
sometimes feral populations occur. In these cases, the mice may damage many
types of crops in the field, especially com, cereal grains, and legun1es.
Australia has mouse ""plagues"" periodically resulting in enormous
losses to stored crops and crops in the field. In buildings, a mouse
infestation can be a considerable nuisance because of the noise, odours, and
droppings. More imp01tantly, they damage insulation and wiring. House
fires  have been caused by mice gnawing
electrical wires; likewise, 
communication systems have been shut down  for 
periods of time resulting in economic losses. Additionally,  house mice are susceptible to a large number
of disease agents and endo-parasites. 


Consequently, they serve as 
reservoirs  and vectors of disease
transmission to humans, pets, and livestock. lmportant among these  diseases 
are leptospirosis, plague, 
salmonella,  lymphocytic choriomeningitis,
and toxoplasmosis. Finally,  when
introduced to islands, mice can cause significant damage to natural resources,
including both flora and fauna. For example, on Gough Island and, mice fed on
nestling albatross chicks . Additionally, Witmer (unpubl. data) documented
seedling damage by house mice in a pen study. However, mice are subordinate to
introduced rats so the impacts of mice not noticed when  rats 
are  also  present 
on  the  island . 
This phenomenon  was demonstrated
by the large increase in mice abundance on Buck Island, USVI, after invasive
roof rats were eradicated.


A large number of  methods and
materials  have been developed to  help solve 
house mouse problems. In general, the use of multiple approaches and
materials - integrated pest management- is more likely to reduce a mouse
problem to a tolerable level . The  tools
available and their proper use  have been
extensively reviewed (Brooks,  1973;
Prakash, 1988; Timm, 1994b; Corrigan, 2001).


Rodenticides are widely used in the United States as well other parts of
the world. Both primary (direct consumption) and secondary hazards (consuming a
poisoned rodent or poisoned non-target animal) can occur to non-target animals
when rodenticides are used.


Rodenticides such as brodifacoum (a second generation anticoagulant) are
highly toxic, but also result in persistent residues in body tissues of animals
that consume poisoned rodents


There is a growing concern about the secondary effects of these residues
in predatory animals (e.g. , Thomas et aI. , 2011). 


Additional research is needed to improve existing methods and to develop
new methods for invasive rodent detection and control. More research is needed
in both lethal and nonlethal means of resolving rodent damage situations.


A number of challenges remain with invasive rodent management and
eradication in the United States. Some of the challenges faced include the
public and agency concerns about the use of toxicants and traps, land access
(especially to private lands), public attitudes, resource availability, and
detection and monitoring difficulties. Nonetheless,  we 
will  hopefully  continue 
to  relieve  the 
burdens  on  insular 
and mainland ec.osystems caused by rodent introductions. The flora and
fauna of islands generally respond favourably and rapidly after invasive
rodents are removed. Endemic. threatened, or endangered species can be, and
have been, re-introduced after successful rodent eradications. For  example, 
the endangered St.  Croix  ground lizard 
(Ameiva  polops) was  recently re­ introduced to Buck Island in the
U.S. Virgin Islands after the successful eradication of roof rats. The recent
eradication of Polynesian rats and house mice from Cocos Island (a small island
off of Guam) set the stage for the re-introduction of the endangered Guam rail (flightless bird species). 


Invasive  rodents  will 
continue  to  pose 
challenges  to  land 
and  resource managers, commodity  producers, 
and  homeowners.  Many 
tools  are  available 
to  reduce  rodent populations and associated damage.
They should be used in a well thought out IPM approach.


Additionally,  seabird  populations, 
sea  turtle  populations 
and  other  island 
resources warrant protection from invasive rodents. The recovery of
fauna and flora on uninhabited islands 
after a successful  rodent
eradication is particularly notable. The significant impacts of introduced
rodents on native flora and fauna have been repeatedly demonstrated. Invasive
rodents are very adaptable, can exploit a wide array of resources as food and
cover, and can increase reproduction very quickly when and where  abundant 
resources  exist.  While 
invasive  rodents will continue to
pose challenges to land and resource managers, they can be controlled or even
eradicated with a well-planned and adequately-supported effort using
rodenticides and other tools. With proper planning, non-target losses  will be 1ninimal and these populations, along
with other island resources, will often recover quickly after the invasive
rodents have been removed.""

</div><div><br/></div><h3>The Impact of the initiative</h3><div>
<p></p>
<p>We believe that we will have an educational impact and important role in the ecological restoration of forests and
damaged landscapes. We have the knowledge, tools and experience to propagate and conserve trees, plants and seeds. A bigger nursery will give us the opportunity to produce more plants and better support our partner projects,
collaborators and visitors, who often request various plants from us.</p>
<p>The installation of a nursery for native and rare tree species, some of which are endangered in our country, is
an important educational and ecological contribution towards the recovery of traditional varieties.</p>
<p><b>The nursery will be open to the public and will also be used as a facility to educate visitors (schools and public) about the importance of these
species for sustainability, balance and resilience of biodiversity and ecosystems.</b></p>
<p>This initiative also will be used in the training of adults, and forest awareness for schools. We are able to
receive school groups as well as being able to go to teach in other institutions.</p>
<p><b>The agroforestry is a large biosphere carbon sink</b>: forest can store in long-term full amounts of carbon, either in plant material or soil organic matter. Your collaboration with this initiave will be a direct and indirect support for this positive effect. </p>
<p>One of our aims is also to allow initiatives like Janas Ecovillage Tree Nursey to be replicated in other places.
We are capable of and motivated to give support for starting nursery projects with biodiverse plants and seeds and also more advanced technical knowledge, such as in wood building, heating and aquaponics systems. We will work together in partneship with <b>WWOOF Portugal </b>(<a href=""https://www.wwoof.pt/pt)"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://www.wwoof.pt/pt)</a>  and <b>Associação Plantar Uma Árvore</b> (<a href=""http://www.plantarumaarvore.org/)"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.plantarumaarvore.org/)</a>  among other related initiaves. </p>
<p>A <b>medium and long term vision</b> is to create local and regional governmental partnerships so we can work together
with local authorities and policies. Our tree nursery will be important to support a bank of plants and seeds for biodiversity.</p>
<div>
<p></p>
<p><br/></p>
</div>
</div><h3>Risks and Challenges</h3><div></div><p>We are very realistic about the risks involved in the new tree nursery project. Although we have the experience
and technical skills to run and maintain a nursery, a permanent structure with heater and aquaponics systems comes along with maintenance costs, costs that we can oversee, count on and already incorporate into our budget plan.
This fundraising campaign is to support the initial investments. We know that in the medium and long term we need to create a self-sustainable model of operation and support. </p>
<p>It is always a challenge for a starting initiative to establish, grow and create a group of local and regional partners,
collaborators and customers. One of our greatest challenges is to get people involved and to establish local/regional governmental partnerships and support. For this we aim to create a communication plan with original design
and advertising with regular news and developments of the nursery construction.</p>

<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">A Ecoaldeia de Janas é um colectivo de pessoas unidas na construção e vivência de um centro de educação não formal para a sustentabilidade prática. Estamos sediados numa das paisagens do conhecido Parque Natural Sintra-Cascais, património mundial da UNESCO e referência da conservação da natureza nacional. Este colectivo trabalha activamente desde 2012 na construção e desenvolvimento deste centro educativo, aplicando e partilhando soluções práticas e inovadoras em prol de uma maior resiliência à escala local e regional. </span></p>
<p><b>Os objectivos desta iniciativa estão baseados no desenvolvimento da experiência e técnica através de uma aprendizagem contínua e prática nos diversos temas e elementos da sustentabilidade</b> que são efectivamente necessários para atingir um sistema ecológico e social em equilíbrio. </p>
<p>Este colectivo tem vindo a construir uma rede coesa de colaboradores, alunos, formadores e técnicos e residentes através de diversas actividades, serviços e produções locais: agrofloresta, viveiros florestais e agrícolas, apicultura natural, ofícios manuais e tradicionais, carpintaria e construção natural, restauro ecológico, consultadoria ambiental e design, educação e formação, produção local e artesanal (conserva saloia de frutas e vegetais, cerveja  e sidra artesanal, cogumelos, entre outras).</p>
<p>O foco em trabalhar a recuperação da paisagem ecológica (solo, biodiversidade vegetal e animal) foi desde o início uma das principais áreas de intevenção prioritárias na Ecoaldeia de Janas.</p>
<p><b>Após quatro anos neste trabalho activo de restauro ecológico a paisagem onde estamos sediados é um exemplo vivo e um caso de estudo de uma sucessão ecológica eficaz com elevados índices de aumento de biodiversidade e produtividade (biomassa, vegetação, forragem, qualidade do solo, animais auxiliares e de pastoreio, abelhas, retenção e disponibilidade de água, entre outras). </b></p>
<p>Ao longo deste tempo e conjuntamente com o centro de formação e visão pedagógica, temos vindo a adquirir diversas capacidades técnicas na propagação de plantas (sementes, herbáceas, arbustos e árvores) e partilhado este conhecimento prático com colaboradores, formadores e alunos das actividades formativas.</p>
<p>Nos anos pioneiros construímos um pequeno viveiro agroflorestal e local para suportar a visão e o plano de recuperação ecológica da paisagem. Este viveiro também permitiu o apoio a outras iniciativas e parcerias locais e regionais com objectivos semelhantes e com necessidades em adquirir plantas e árvores com qualidade e biodiversidade para diversas funções ecológicas. Neste momento temos mais de quatro mil variedades de plantas de árvores e arbustos no viveiro e prevê-se já neste ano corrente atingir os dez mil exemplares. </p>
<p><b>Este é o momento certo para dar o grande salto, partilhar a nossa experiência, conhecimento e capacidades técnicas e ter um maior impacto no desenvolvimento da restauração ecológica através da implementação de um viveiro de árvores com maior dimensão e capacidade.</b></p>
<p>O nosso principal objectivo é a implementação de um viveiro de grande escala para produção diversa de espécies de árvores, arbustos e plantas herbáceas, classificadas em três áreas principais de acção e investigação:</p>
</div><div>
<p>     <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1465743308/%C3%A1rvores-e-arbustos_apxosr.jpg"" src="""" style=""background-color: initial;""/></p>
</div><div>
<div>
<p>(i) investigação, recuperação, propagação e conservação de <b>variedades de plantas nativas e tradicionais</b> (naturalmente adaptadas ao clima e condições abióticas de Portugal);</p>
<p>(ii) investigação, propagação, conservação e introdução de variedades de <b>árvores adaptadas ao clima mediterrânico e com elevado potencial e diversas funções ecológicas para sistemas agroflorestais e recuperação de ecossistemas;</b></p>
<p>(iii) investigação, recuperação, propagação e conservação de<b> árvores frutíferas e variedades tradicionais</b> para alimentação humana (naturalmente adaptadas ao clima e condições abióticas de Portugal);</p>
<br/>
</div>
<h3>O que precisamos e o que recebes</h3>
<div>
<p>Para implementar o projecto de construção do viveiro florestal de uma forma estável e sustentável estamos a necessitar, nesta fase inicial, de um suporte colaborativo de 4.900 euros (5.600 dólares). Este é o montante mínimo considerado nesta campanha e que tem como objectivo angariar o mínimo essencial para o arranque do projecto e etapas iniciais de investimento, numa <b>iniciativa que pretende produzir mais de 20 000 árvores no segundo ano de implementação</b>. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1463096387/a-construir_pi7z0z.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">O montante angariado e previsto nesta campanha colaborativa será repartido em três áreas principais de construção e implementação:</span></p>
<p>(i) um <b>viveiro de 80 m2</b> de estrutura em madeira e vidro e com bancadas próprias de propagação de plantas. A equipa da Ecoaldeia de Janas suporta os processos construtivos da estrutura.</p>
<p>(ii) um <b>queimador de biomassa</b> que vai funcionar como aquecedor para a regulação da temperatura de inverno, fundamental para manter as condições bióticas e abióticas para a conservação e manutenção das plantas em estufa (principalmente para as espécies raras e em perigo de extinção, reduzindo assim a probabilidade de perdas)</p>
<p>(iii) a instalação de um<b> sistema de aquaponia </b>que vai garantir um sistema combinado e em circuito fechado para fertilizar as plantas, garantir as necessidades nutricionais, aumentar a produtividade e reduzir os resíduos através da reutilização dos subprodutos. </p>
<p>Todo o orçamento está dimensionado para garantir a quantidade mínima de investimento que é necessária para implementar a fase de arranque do viveiro de árvores agroflorestais. Se não atingirmos esta meta colaborativa, iniciaremos apenas com a instalação da estufa de madeira e bancadas de propagação de plantas e sementes de árvores.</p>
<p><b>Ao colaborares com esta campanha, o que podes ganhar está estritamente relacionado com o impacto da iniciativa </b>(ver a próxima secção) que entre outras possibilidades, ressalvamos as seguintes: visitar, aprender e praticar  com técnicos experientes, como implementar e manter um viveiro combinado com três sistemas (propagação, queimador de biomassa e aquaponia), ter acesso e adquirir a biodiversidade de plantas e sementes para diversas funções, ter suporte técnico para serviços exteriores de design ecológico e restauro agroflorestal e <b>colaborar com um projecto que actua directamente como sumidouro de carbono devido ao papel importante que a árvore tem neste sentido</b>.</p>
<p>A campanha de angariação de fundos está dividida por diversos retornos e vantagens em biodiversidade e quantidades de plantas ou sementes para instalares a tua agrofloresta (etapas iniciais ou avançadas). Ao colaborares vais poder receber sementes, tubérculos, plantas, árvores de fruto e indicadas para a agrofloresta. Poderás também participar em acções de formação sobre agrofloresta na Ecoaldeia de Janas e obter um certificado como co-fundador deste viveiro de árvores. </p>
<p><br/></p>
</div>
<p></p>
<h3>Impacto da Iniciativa</h3>
<div>
<p>Acreditamos que teremos um impacto significativo e um papel educacional importante na restauração ecológica de
florestas, agroflorestas e paisagens danificadas pela intervenção humana ao longo das ultimas décadas. Estamos capacitados com conhecimento, ferramentas, técnicas e experiência na propagação e conservação de plantas
florestais, arbustivas e herbáceas e sementes. Um viveiro florestal com maior dimensão vai trazer a possibilidade de produzir (propagar) uma maior quantidade de plantas e suportar melhor os projectos parceiros com actividades
semelhantes ou colaboradores e visitantes que necessitam de adquirir plantas com grande variedade de funções e riqueza em espécies diversas. </p>
<p>A criação de um viveiro com três grandes áreas de intervenção de regeneração florestal (plantas nativas,
plantas mediterrânicas e raras com elevado potencial, plantas frutíferas tradicionais) tem uma contribuição pedagógica e ecológica muito importante na recuperação de espécies, muitas delas com risco de extinção
ou em perigo. </p>
<p><b>Este novo viveiro estará aberto ao público e será utilizado para facilitar acções de formação aos visitantes
(público em geral, grupos escolares, etc) com grande foco na sensibilização sobre a importância da preservação das espécies para o equilíbrio e resiliência da biodiversidade nos ecossistemas agroflorestais. </b></p>
<p>Esta iniciativa vai permitir ter um espaço aberto e preparado para receber e facilitar acções de formação para
adultos e acções de sensibilização para grupos e escolas. Estaremos igualmente disponíveis para levar o nosso trabalho e conhecimento às escolas e instituições da região.</p>
<p><b>A agrofloresta é um grande sumidouro de carbono</b> da biosfera: as florestas podem acumular a longo prazo grandes quantidades de carbono, quer no material vegetal, quer na matéria orgânica. São diversos os relatórios científicos e acordos intergovernamentais para o combate às alterações climáticas que referem a importância da conservação e reflorestação das florestas por estas serem consideradas um dos reservatórios de carbono mais importantes à escala global e local. O aumento da área destes ecossistemas terá um impacte positivo na capacidade de sumidouro de carbono da biosfera e <b>ao colaborares com esta iniciativa estás a suportar directa e indirectamente este efeito positivo</b>. Vamos propagar plantas, árvores e sementes para a instalação de agroflorestas e sumidouros de carbono e o teu apoio é essencial. </p>
<p>Um dos nossos objectivos vai passar também por dar a oportunidade de iniciativas como o viveiro florestal de Janas
poder ser replicado noutras localidades do país. Estamos capacitados e motivados para colaborar com quem quiser iniciar um viveiro com grande variedade em espécies de plantas e sementes, incluindo o suporte técnico de um
sistema combinado (estrutura em madeira e vidro, bancadas de propagação, aquecimento a biomassa e aquaponia). Entre alguns parceiros destacamos a colaboração com a plataforma de voluntariado <b>WWOOF Portugal</b> (<a href=""https://www.wwoof.pt/pt)"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://www.wwoof.pt/pt)</a> e a <b>Associação Plantar Uma Árvore</b>  (<a href=""http://www.plantarumaarvore.org/)"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.plantarumaarvore.org/)</a> . </p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">A </span><b style=""background-color: initial;"">visão a médio e longo prazo </b><span style=""background-color: initial;"">passa muito pela criação de parcerias estratégicas com as instituições governamentais
da região para que possamos trabalhar em conjunto com as políticas de intervenção local e regional. Neste sentido, o viveiro florestal de Janas terá um papel importante na criação de um banco de sementes e plantas da
região, nativas, tradicionais, raras e com grande potencial ecológico de regeneração. </span><br/></p>
</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>
<h3>Riscos e desafios</h3>
<p>Estamos conscientes dos riscos envolvidos na construção de um novo e maior viveiro de árvores e plantas. Estamos capacitados com experiência, técnicas e ferramentas para desenvolver e manter um viveiro e propagação de plantas em bancadas e a instalação de um sistema de combinado de aquecimento e de aquaponia, o que implica custos adicionais de manutenção e que estão considerados nesta etapa inicial. Esta campanha de angariação tem o objectivo de suportar o arranque e investimentos iniciais da instalação de um viveiro. Está planeado a criação de um modelo sustentável para o funcionamento de todo o projecto, a médio e longo prazo.</p>
<p>É sempre um desafio encontrar um equilíbrio estável de uma iniciativa que está em crescimento, incluindo a ligação com as parcerias locais e regionais, colaboradores e visitantes. Um dos nossos grandes desafios será levar as pessoas a envolverem-se no projecto e a suportarem a nossa visão e estabelecer parcerias estratégicas com as instituições governamentais locais e regionais. Para este fim, desenhamos um plano de comunicação com um design original que garanta a publicação regular de notícias com os desenvolvimentos da implementação e funcionamento de todo o projecto a curto, médio e longo prazo. </p>

The Impact of the initiative

We believe that we will have an educational impact and important role in the ecological restoration of forests and
damaged landscapes. We have the knowledge, tools and experience to propagate and conserve trees, plants and seeds. A bigger nursery will give us the opportunity to produce more plants and better support our partner projects,
collaborators and visitors, who often request various plants from us.
The installation of a nursery for native and rare tree species, some of which are endangered in our country, is
an important educational and ecological contribution towards the recovery of traditional varieties.
The nursery will be open to the public and will also be used as a facility to educate visitors (schools and public) about the importance of these
species for sustainability, balance and resilience of biodiversity and ecosystems.
This initiative also will be used in the training of adults, and forest awareness for schools. We are able to
receive school groups as well as being able to go to teach in other institutions.
The agroforestry is a large biosphere carbon sink: forest can store in long-term full amounts of carbon, either in plant material or soil organic matter. Your collaboration with this initiave will be a direct and indirect support for this positive effect. 
One of our aims is also to allow initiatives like Janas Ecovillage Tree Nursey to be replicated in other places.
We are capable of and motivated to give support for starting nursery projects with biodiverse plants and seeds and also more advanced technical knowledge, such as in wood building, heating and aquaponics systems. We will work together in partneship with WWOOF Portugal (https://www.wwoof.pt/pt)  and Associação Plantar Uma Árvore (http://www.plantarumaarvore.org/)  among other related initiaves. 
A medium and long term vision is to create local and regional governmental partnerships so we can work together
with local authorities and policies. Our tree nursery will be important to support a bank of plants and seeds for biodiversity.




Risks and ChallengesWe are very realistic about the risks involved in the new tree nursery project. Although we have the experience
and technical skills to run and maintain a nursery, a permanent structure with heater and aquaponics systems comes along with maintenance costs, costs that we can oversee, count on and already incorporate into our budget plan.
This fundraising campaign is to support the initial investments. We know that in the medium and long term we need to create a self-sustainable model of operation and support. 
It is always a challenge for a starting initiative to establish, grow and create a group of local and regional partners,
collaborators and customers. One of our greatest challenges is to get people involved and to establish local/regional governmental partnerships and support. For this we aim to create a communication plan with original design
and advertising with regular news and developments of the nursery construction.

A Ecoaldeia de Janas é um colectivo de pessoas unidas na construção e vivência de um centro de educação não formal para a sustentabilidade prática. Estamos sediados numa das paisagens do conhecido Parque Natural Sintra-Cascais, património mundial da UNESCO e referência da conservação da natureza nacional. Este colectivo trabalha activamente desde 2012 na construção e desenvolvimento deste centro educativo, aplicando e partilhando soluções práticas e inovadoras em prol de uma maior resiliência à escala local e regional. 
Os objectivos desta iniciativa estão baseados no desenvolvimento da experiência e técnica através de uma aprendizagem contínua e prática nos diversos temas e elementos da sustentabilidade que são efectivamente necessários para atingir um sistema ecológico e social em equilíbrio. 
Este colectivo tem vindo a construir uma rede coesa de colaboradores, alunos, formadores e técnicos e residentes através de diversas actividades, serviços e produções locais: agrofloresta, viveiros florestais e agrícolas, apicultura natural, ofícios manuais e tradicionais, carpintaria e construção natural, restauro ecológico, consultadoria ambiental e design, educação e formação, produção local e artesanal (conserva saloia de frutas e vegetais, cerveja  e sidra artesanal, cogumelos, entre outras).
O foco em trabalhar a recuperação da paisagem ecológica (solo, biodiversidade vegetal e animal) foi desde o início uma das principais áreas de intevenção prioritárias na Ecoaldeia de Janas.
Após quatro anos neste trabalho activo de restauro ecológico a paisagem onde estamos sediados é um exemplo vivo e um caso de estudo de uma sucessão ecológica eficaz com elevados índices de aumento de biodiversidade e produtividade (biomassa, vegetação, forragem, qualidade do solo, animais auxiliares e de pastoreio, abelhas, retenção e disponibilidade de água, entre outras). 
Ao longo deste tempo e conjuntamente com o centro de formação e visão pedagógica, temos vindo a adquirir diversas capacidades técnicas na propagação de plantas (sementes, herbáceas, arbustos e árvores) e partilhado este conhecimento prático com colaboradores, formadores e alunos das actividades formativas.
Nos anos pioneiros construímos um pequeno viveiro agroflorestal e local para suportar a visão e o plano de recuperação ecológica da paisagem. Este viveiro também permitiu o apoio a outras iniciativas e parcerias locais e regionais com objectivos semelhantes e com necessidades em adquirir plantas e árvores com qualidade e biodiversidade para diversas funções ecológicas. Neste momento temos mais de quatro mil variedades de plantas de árvores e arbustos no viveiro e prevê-se já neste ano corrente atingir os dez mil exemplares. 
Este é o momento certo para dar o grande salto, partilhar a nossa experiência, conhecimento e capacidades técnicas e ter um maior impacto no desenvolvimento da restauração ecológica através da implementação de um viveiro de árvores com maior dimensão e capacidade.
O nosso principal objectivo é a implementação de um viveiro de grande escala para produção diversa de espécies de árvores, arbustos e plantas herbáceas, classificadas em três áreas principais de acção e investigação:

     


(i) investigação, recuperação, propagação e conservação de variedades de plantas nativas e tradicionais (naturalmente adaptadas ao clima e condições abióticas de Portugal);
(ii) investigação, propagação, conservação e introdução de variedades de árvores adaptadas ao clima mediterrânico e com elevado potencial e diversas funções ecológicas para sistemas agroflorestais e recuperação de ecossistemas;
(iii) investigação, recuperação, propagação e conservação de árvores frutíferas e variedades tradicionais para alimentação humana (naturalmente adaptadas ao clima e condições abióticas de Portugal);


O que precisamos e o que recebes

Para implementar o projecto de construção do viveiro florestal de uma forma estável e sustentável estamos a necessitar, nesta fase inicial, de um suporte colaborativo de 4.900 euros (5.600 dólares). Este é o montante mínimo considerado nesta campanha e que tem como objectivo angariar o mínimo essencial para o arranque do projecto e etapas iniciais de investimento, numa iniciativa que pretende produzir mais de 20 000 árvores no segundo ano de implementação. 


 
O montante angariado e previsto nesta campanha colaborativa será repartido em três áreas principais de construção e implementação:
(i) um viveiro de 80 m2 de estrutura em madeira e vidro e com bancadas próprias de propagação de plantas. A equipa da Ecoaldeia de Janas suporta os processos construtivos da estrutura.
(ii) um queimador de biomassa que vai funcionar como aquecedor para a regulação da temperatura de inverno, fundamental para manter as condições bióticas e abióticas para a conservação e manutenção das plantas em estufa (principalmente para as espécies raras e em perigo de extinção, reduzindo assim a probabilidade de perdas)
(iii) a instalação de um sistema de aquaponia que vai garantir um sistema combinado e em circuito fechado para fertilizar as plantas, garantir as necessidades nutricionais, aumentar a produtividade e reduzir os resíduos através da reutilização dos subprodutos. 
Todo o orçamento está dimensionado para garantir a quantidade mínima de investimento que é necessária para implementar a fase de arranque do viveiro de árvores agroflorestais. Se não atingirmos esta meta colaborativa, iniciaremos apenas com a instalação da estufa de madeira e bancadas de propagação de plantas e sementes de árvores.
Ao colaborares com esta campanha, o que podes ganhar está estritamente relacionado com o impacto da iniciativa (ver a próxima secção) que entre outras possibilidades, ressalvamos as seguintes: visitar, aprender e praticar  com técnicos experientes, como implementar e manter um viveiro combinado com três sistemas (propagação, queimador de biomassa e aquaponia), ter acesso e adquirir a biodiversidade de plantas e sementes para diversas funções, ter suporte técnico para serviços exteriores de design ecológico e restauro agroflorestal e colaborar com um projecto que actua directamente como sumidouro de carbono devido ao papel importante que a árvore tem neste sentido.
A campanha de angariação de fundos está dividida por diversos retornos e vantagens em biodiversidade e quantidades de plantas ou sementes para instalares a tua agrofloresta (etapas iniciais ou avançadas). Ao colaborares vais poder receber sementes, tubérculos, plantas, árvores de fruto e indicadas para a agrofloresta. Poderás também participar em acções de formação sobre agrofloresta na Ecoaldeia de Janas e obter um certificado como co-fundador deste viveiro de árvores. 



Impacto da Iniciativa

Acreditamos que teremos um impacto significativo e um papel educacional importante na restauração ecológica de
florestas, agroflorestas e paisagens danificadas pela intervenção humana ao longo das ultimas décadas. Estamos capacitados com conhecimento, ferramentas, técnicas e experiência na propagação e conservação de plantas
florestais, arbustivas e herbáceas e sementes. Um viveiro florestal com maior dimensão vai trazer a possibilidade de produzir (propagar) uma maior quantidade de plantas e suportar melhor os projectos parceiros com actividades
semelhantes ou colaboradores e visitantes que necessitam de adquirir plantas com grande variedade de funções e riqueza em espécies diversas. 
A criação de um viveiro com três grandes áreas de intervenção de regeneração florestal (plantas nativas,
plantas mediterrânicas e raras com elevado potencial, plantas frutíferas tradicionais) tem uma contribuição pedagógica e ecológica muito importante na recuperação de espécies, muitas delas com risco de extinção
ou em perigo. 
Este novo viveiro estará aberto ao público e será utilizado para facilitar acções de formação aos visitantes
(público em geral, grupos escolares, etc) com grande foco na sensibilização sobre a importância da preservação das espécies para o equilíbrio e resiliência da biodiversidade nos ecossistemas agroflorestais. 
Esta iniciativa vai permitir ter um espaço aberto e preparado para receber e facilitar acções de formação para
adultos e acções de sensibilização para grupos e escolas. Estaremos igualmente disponíveis para levar o nosso trabalho e conhecimento às escolas e instituições da região.
A agrofloresta é um grande sumidouro de carbono da biosfera: as florestas podem acumular a longo prazo grandes quantidades de carbono, quer no material vegetal, quer na matéria orgânica. São diversos os relatórios científicos e acordos intergovernamentais para o combate às alterações climáticas que referem a importância da conservação e reflorestação das florestas por estas serem consideradas um dos reservatórios de carbono mais importantes à escala global e local. O aumento da área destes ecossistemas terá um impacte positivo na capacidade de sumidouro de carbono da biosfera e ao colaborares com esta iniciativa estás a suportar directa e indirectamente este efeito positivo. Vamos propagar plantas, árvores e sementes para a instalação de agroflorestas e sumidouros de carbono e o teu apoio é essencial. 
Um dos nossos objectivos vai passar também por dar a oportunidade de iniciativas como o viveiro florestal de Janas
poder ser replicado noutras localidades do país. Estamos capacitados e motivados para colaborar com quem quiser iniciar um viveiro com grande variedade em espécies de plantas e sementes, incluindo o suporte técnico de um
sistema combinado (estrutura em madeira e vidro, bancadas de propagação, aquecimento a biomassa e aquaponia). Entre alguns parceiros destacamos a colaboração com a plataforma de voluntariado WWOOF Portugal (https://www.wwoof.pt/pt) e a Associação Plantar Uma Árvore  (http://www.plantarumaarvore.org/) . 
A visão a médio e longo prazo passa muito pela criação de parcerias estratégicas com as instituições governamentais
da região para que possamos trabalhar em conjunto com as políticas de intervenção local e regional. Neste sentido, o viveiro florestal de Janas terá um papel importante na criação de um banco de sementes e plantas da
região, nativas, tradicionais, raras e com grande potencial ecológico de regeneração. 



Riscos e desafios
Estamos conscientes dos riscos envolvidos na construção de um novo e maior viveiro de árvores e plantas. Estamos capacitados com experiência, técnicas e ferramentas para desenvolver e manter um viveiro e propagação de plantas em bancadas e a instalação de um sistema de combinado de aquecimento e de aquaponia, o que implica custos adicionais de manutenção e que estão considerados nesta etapa inicial. Esta campanha de angariação tem o objectivo de suportar o arranque e investimentos iniciais da instalação de um viveiro. Está planeado a criação de um modelo sustentável para o funcionamento de todo o projecto, a médio e longo prazo.
É sempre um desafio encontrar um equilíbrio estável de uma iniciativa que está em crescimento, incluindo a ligação com as parcerias locais e regionais, colaboradores e visitantes. Um dos nossos grandes desafios será levar as pessoas a envolverem-se no projecto e a suportarem a nossa visão e estabelecer parcerias estratégicas com as instituições governamentais locais e regionais. Para este fim, desenhamos um plano de comunicação com um design original que garanta a publicação regular de notícias com os desenvolvimentos da implementação e funcionamento de todo o projecto a curto, médio e longo prazo.

<p>Plastic baling twine
is killing
wildlife[i], polluting their habitat and producing tons of waste in
local landfills. Although it is a useful material for tying bales of hay,
the continuous disposal harms the environment. 39,050,000 ft.[ii] of plastic
twine is used and discarded every year in the San Luis Valley of south
central Colorado. The nearest recycling center is 10 hours driving distance,
which is why farmers and ranchers typically burn or bury it. </p>
<p><b>Why Would You Care?</b></p>
<p>Apart from the negative
impact on wildlife, discarding
twine can be detrimental to the human environment. Burned twine releases
chemicals that are known to cause cancer and respiratory disease. Buried
twine produces toxic chemicals that leach into the soil and groundwater,
mainly used for drinking and agriculture. It is important for Colorado,
and other states to be aware of this plastic twine problem.</p><p><span style=""background-color: initial;""><b>How We Plan to Fix It</b></span></p>
<p>Our team has developed a
multi-faceted approach to this environmental problem. We have created a
statewide team that will develop an educational program and a recycling system.
Recycling and re-utilization of the plastic twine is our short term plan. The long term plan is to replace the usage of plastic twine with a biodegradable alternative.This fundraiser, is specifically
geared towards gathering funds for buying bins and equipment for collecting,
and leveraging other sources of funding. After a collection system is
established, the twine will be sent to designated places for recycling and
re-purposing. </p>
<p>This project will create

Plastic baling twine
is killing
wildlife[i], polluting their habitat and producing tons of waste in
local landfills. Although it is a useful material for tying bales of hay,
the continuous disposal harms the environment. 39,050,000 ft.[ii] of plastic
twine is used and discarded every year in the San Luis Valley of south
central Colorado. The nearest recycling center is 10 hours driving distance,
which is why farmers and ranchers typically burn or bury it. 
Why Would You Care?
Apart from the negative
impact on wildlife, discarding
twine can be detrimental to the human environment. Burned twine releases
chemicals that are known to cause cancer and respiratory disease. Buried
twine produces toxic chemicals that leach into the soil and groundwater,
mainly used for drinking and agriculture. It is important for Colorado,
and other states to be aware of this plastic twine problem.How We Plan to Fix It
Our team has developed a
multi-faceted approach to this environmental problem. We have created a
statewide team that will develop an educational program and a recycling system.
Recycling and re-utilization of the plastic twine is our short term plan. The long term plan is to replace the usage of plastic twine with a biodegradable alternative.This fundraiser, is specifically
geared towards gathering funds for buying bins and equipment for collecting,
and leveraging other sources of funding. After a collection system is
established, the twine will be sent to designated places for recycling and
re-purposing. 
This project will create
new job opportunities, introduce innovative ways of creating a zero waste
environment, and will bring the SLV farming community together. It has huge
potential for the San Luis Valley, and for rural Colorado.

<span style=""font-size: 30px; letter-spacing: 1px;"">What is Liter of Light Ghana?</span><br/>
</h3>
</div><p style=""text-align: justify;"">Liter of Light Ghana is a growing organization that seeks to provide eco-friendly, cost-effective solar lighting to communities that are deprived or have inadequate access to light. The technology that Liter of Light operates on is one that was developed by 'My Shelter Foundation', an NGO based in the Philippines. Founded by Illiac Diaz, the organization developed this innovative process that marries solar panels with recycled plastic bottles to produce clean, renewable lighting. Along with materials that can be sourced locally, these lights can be installed in electricity-deprived homes.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">In a country such as Ghana with well over 300 days of uninterrupted sunlight, it is expedient to harvest this natural source of energy to ameliorate the issue at hand. This technology has been used by the UN and has been adopted in some UNHCR camps worldwide.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">The liter of light Ghana team is comprised of young adults with a common goal of improving the lives of people in our beloved country, Ghana, and eventually beyond our country’s borders. The team plans on building and installing solar lanterns for 100 homes this December. </p><p>Below are some of the lights the team will be building for the project:</p><p></p><p><b>Daylight </b></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1448156012/foioc1zrsxsp1cqx2fhx.png"" src="""" style=""""/>    </p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p><b>Nightlight </b></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1448156282/hb6omatv6mhn9onw4rj2.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><div><br/></div><div><br/></div><b>Streetlight</b><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1448156326/d52r1woyqloa0dy9ndjk.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><div><br/></div><div>

<span style=""font-size: 30px; letter-spacing: 1px;"">The Problem</span><br/>
</h3>
</div><p style=""text-align: justify;"">Most people would agree that light is a basic necessity of life, to be seen as a right and not a privilege. Unfortunately, many people in the world (approx 1.3 billion) live without access to adequate electricity and thus light. Many small communities in Ghana (especially on the outskirts of town) are not even connected to the national electricity grid. When nighttime comes, most activity (and productivity) slows down considerably and even comes to a halt as there is no adequate lighting to help individuals and families carry out simple tasks. Children rely on candles or health hazardous kerosene lamps to study at night. Apart from straining their eyes to study under the dim, flickering lights these lamps offer, they put their healths at risk by inhaling the toxic kerosene fumes emanating from the lamps.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">Many families, who tend to use candles a  lot, are at a higher risk of having house fires and/or sustaining multiple degree burns due to accidents with these alternative lights. A visit to the Korle-Bu teaching hospital’s burns and reconstructive block last year helped the team see first-hand the damage that candle and kerosene lamp use has caused. Whole families lay in recovery rooms with life-threatening burns from accidents with candles/kerosene lamps. Many of these individuals and families lost their homes, and in some cases their loved ones, to these fires.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">Kerosene lanterns are a poverty trap for these families. They may seem like the best alternative but serve only to retard health and burn holes in the pockets of these low income families who depend on them each night. Buying kerosene each day is expensive in the long run; both on the incomes and health of these people.</p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1448155479/kliq11qezroxdaqonk6r.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p>It is not uncommon in Ghana to see a child doing his homework with a kerosene lamp, or a candle, or for market vendors to use candles to try to illuminate their work spaces when it gets dark.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">To these communities, reliance on candles and kerosene lamps seems to be an inevitable option or may even seem to them to be the solution to their problems. This reliance however has obvious disadvantages. Smoke from kerosene and candles cause respiratory illness and may subsequently cause death. Precious lives are also lost through fire outbreaks from these crude modes of light.</p><div>
<h3><br/></h3>
<ul> </ul>
<div></div>
</div><h2><span>The Pilot</span></h2><p style=""text-align: justify;"">Earlier this year, in July, a pilot project was conducted in a small community called Akorlikope in the southeastern part of Ghana. Members of Liter of light Ghana built and installed lanterns in two homes as well as a local school. The event aimed at introducing the concept of solar lighting to the community, as well as to see how interested the community was in learning how to build these lights for themselves. By the end of the event, we were able to see first-hand the advantages of solar lighting to the people’s lives, as well as evaluate our performance as a team. We were pleasantly surprised to learn that every single member of the community was as involved us our team in building and installing the lights. The pilot was nothing short of successful, and seeing all the joy and gratitude expressed by members of the community only served to get the team even more excited for December.</p><br/><br/><p></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""326"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2Fg_KlguQ7Kak%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3Dg_KlguQ7Kak%26feature%3Dyoutu.be&amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2Fg_KlguQ7Kak%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube"" width=""580""></iframe></div><br/><p></p><h2><br/></h2><h2>The Solution</h2><p style=""text-align: justify;"">The ultimate solution to the issue would be a sustainable and inexpensive one, which is why the solar alternative will be beneficial to rural communities in Ghana.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">The immediate goal of this project is to provide 100 homes with this cost-effective and long-lasting source of lighting in December. The aim is to get as much hands-on experience as possible, hence the Liter of Light Ghana team will be assembling the equipment under the supervision of electricians and engineers. The lights will then be taken to the various target communities and installed. Not all the assembling will be done prior to the project day. The team intends on making some materials available to teach the people of the Trawa community how to build these solar lanterns.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1448278026/sdvkrcwlblchenhiwf1c.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><br/><p style=""text-align: justify;""><br/></p><h2>What does the project offer to the community? </h2><p style=""text-align: justify;"">Our combination of day, night and street lights provide a cheap, clean alternative to communities that totally removes the financial burden that kerosene places on these people who are largely very poor subsistence farmers at NO cost to them at all.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">This project also significantly reduces the carbon footprints that each of these communities leave. Even though the CO2 and black carbon each of these communities emit from their use of kerosene lamps may seem insignificant, collectively kerosene is a major contributor to our total carbon dioxide pollution as a nation. We can contribute to reducing that significantly.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""><span>Our goal Is to raise $10,000 before the project date.This will go toward purchasing the materials needed to assemble the solar lanterns needed to light up a 100 homes, as well as 10 streetlights for community.

</div></div>","What is Liter of Light Ghana?

Liter of Light Ghana is a growing organization that seeks to provide eco-friendly, cost-effective solar lighting to communities that are deprived or have inadequate access to light. The technology that Liter of Light operates on is one that was developed by 'My Shelter Foundation', an NGO based in the Philippines. Founded by Illiac Diaz, the organization developed this innovative process that marries solar panels with recycled plastic bottles to produce clean, renewable lighting. Along with materials that can be sourced locally, these lights can be installed in electricity-deprived homes.In a country such as Ghana with well over 300 days of uninterrupted sunlight, it is expedient to harvest this natural source of energy to ameliorate the issue at hand. This technology has been used by the UN and has been adopted in some UNHCR camps worldwide.The liter of light Ghana team is comprised of young adults with a common goal of improving the lives of people in our beloved country, Ghana, and eventually beyond our country’s borders. The team plans on building and installing solar lanterns for 100 homes this December. Below are some of the lights the team will be building for the project:Daylight     Nightlight Streetlight




The Problem

Most people would agree that light is a basic necessity of life, to be seen as a right and not a privilege. Unfortunately, many people in the world (approx 1.3 billion) live without access to adequate electricity and thus light. Many small communities in Ghana (especially on the outskirts of town) are not even connected to the national electricity grid. When nighttime comes, most activity (and productivity) slows down considerably and even comes to a halt as there is no adequate lighting to help individuals and families carry out simple tasks. Children rely on candles or health hazardous kerosene lamps to study at night. Apart from straining their eyes to study under the dim, flickering lights these lamps offer, they put their healths at risk by inhaling the toxic kerosene fumes emanating from the lamps.Many families, who tend to use candles a  lot, are at a higher risk of having house fires and/or sustaining multiple degree burns due to accidents with these alternative lights. A visit to the Korle-Bu teaching hospital’s burns and reconstructive block last year helped the team see first-hand the damage that candle and kerosene lamp use has caused. Whole families lay in recovery rooms with life-threatening burns from accidents with candles/kerosene lamps. Many of these individuals and families lost their homes, and in some cases their loved ones, to these fires.Kerosene lanterns are a poverty trap for these families. They may seem like the best alternative but serve only to retard health and burn holes in the pockets of these low income families who depend on them each night. Buying kerosene each day is expensive in the long run; both on the incomes and health of these people.It is not uncommon in Ghana to see a child doing his homework with a kerosene lamp, or a candle, or for market vendors to use candles to try to illuminate their work spaces when it gets dark.To these communities, reliance on candles and kerosene lamps seems to be an inevitable option or may even seem to them to be the solution to their problems. This reliance however has obvious disadvantages. Smoke from kerosene and candles cause respiratory illness and may subsequently cause death. Precious lives are also lost through fire outbreaks from these crude modes of light.

 

The PilotEarlier this year, in July, a pilot project was conducted in a small community called Akorlikope in the southeastern part of Ghana. Members of Liter of light Ghana built and installed lanterns in two homes as well as a local school. The event aimed at introducing the concept of solar lighting to the community, as well as to see how interested the community was in learning how to build these lights for themselves. By the end of the event, we were able to see first-hand the advantages of solar lighting to the people’s lives, as well as evaluate our performance as a team. We were pleasantly surprised to learn that every single member of the community was as involved us our team in building and installing the lights. The pilot was nothing short of successful, and seeing all the joy and gratitude expressed by members of the community only served to get the team even more excited for December.The SolutionThe ultimate solution to the issue would be a sustainable and inexpensive one, which is why the solar alternative will be beneficial to rural communities in Ghana.The immediate goal of this project is to provide 100 homes with this cost-effective and long-lasting source of lighting in December. The aim is to get as much hands-on experience as possible, hence the Liter of Light Ghana team will be assembling the equipment under the supervision of electricians and engineers. The lights will then be taken to the various target communities and installed. Not all the assembling will be done prior to the project day. The team intends on making some materials available to teach the people of the Trawa community how to build these solar lanterns.What does the project offer to the community? Our combination of day, night and street lights provide a cheap, clean alternative to communities that totally removes the financial burden that kerosene places on these people who are largely very poor subsistence farmers at NO cost to them at all.This project also significantly reduces the carbon footprints that each of these communities leave. Even though the CO2 and black carbon each of these communities emit from their use of kerosene lamps may seem insignificant, collectively kerosene is a major contributor to our total carbon dioxide pollution as a nation. We can contribute to reducing that significantly.Our goal Is to raise $10,000 before the project date.This will go toward purchasing the materials needed to assemble the solar lanterns needed to light up a 100 homes, as well as 10 streetlights for community. Other costs include paying electricians and carpenters (who will be installing solar panels on roofs of homes), as well as logistics and transportation.Risks & ChallengesOne of our main challenges from the start of the project was ensuring that we had quality materials to build these lanterns. After extensive research we found and partnered with a Ghanaian-based company (Rikal Ghana Ltd) specializing in solar electrical products. To ensure each component would work efficiently as planned, we carried out a pilot project in a small community called Akorlikope, where we installed some of these lanterns with the aim of testing their efficiency and durability. The project was successful and the lanterns worked exactly how they were supposed to, and they continue to function well even till date. One challenge we'll need to address for the project will be ensuring that we have the most quality materials for the project. This will involve ensuring quality control throughout the project. Along with engineers from Rikal, we will be performing quality checks at every stage in the project to ensure the lanterns meet the quality standards to be as sustainable as possible.The long-term plan/SustainabilityThere’s an old adage that goes, “give a man a fish and you feed him for a day; teach a man to fish and you feed him for a lifetime..”There is no greater gesture of service than teaching someone in need of something to be self-sufficient and sustainable in producing whatever it is they lack.  One of the issues the team faced with past service projects was that these projects were not sufficiently sustainable. The team usually made donations of food and/or toiletries to the needy, or spent the day with kids at a local orphanage. Although these projects helped those in need, they were never sustainable enough. The donation of food items, which served these children well in the short term, was eventually going to run out, and the thought of that was unsettling. The team vowed from that point on to adopt a more sustainable approach to serving our community. The Liter of light ‘project 100 homes’ aims to fulfill this desire, and is our most sustainable project yet. The long-term goal would be to equip volunteers from each community with the know-how to be able to build solar lanterns themselves with the aim of fostering civic engagement and independence within the communities.

<p><b>WHY THE PANA'EWA DISCOVERY FOREST MATTERS:</b></p>
<p>The Pana'ewa zoo Discovery Forest is providing education, recreation, and volunteer opportunities for community residents and visitors. In addition to community volunteers, students from Kamehameha Schools, Pacific Quest, Ka'u High, Kiwanis Kids, Prince Jonah Kūhiō Kalani‘ana‘ole Elementary and Intermediate School, and Malamalama Waldorf School have all participated in the creation of the Discovery Forest. As of January 2015, over 300 volunteers have helped to create and maintain the Discovery Forest.</p>
<p>In March, Certified Traditional Hawaiian Hale Builder “Unko Waltah” began working with community volunteers to build a traditional Hawaiian Hale at the Discovery Forest. This important aspect of the project is helping to perpetuate the Hawaiian culture by revitalizing and sharing the skills of building a structure out of materials from the ‘āina. Materials for the Hale Ku’ai/Papa’a will come from Pana’ewa lands. Hale workshops are being held every 1.5months until structure is completed.

These “canoe plants,"" along with many endemic species, play essential roles in Hawaiian culture, for food, fiber, tools, implements, building materials, and medicine, as well as biodiversity and ecological health. 


Hawaii's Forests Play a Key Role in Island Sustainability! 
PROJECT BREAKDOWN: Phase I: Engaged community volunteers in creating and maintaining Native and Agro‐forest (Polynesian-introduced species) demonstration gardens.                        COMPLETED 2011

Phase II: Installed interpretive signage and plant ID labels and engaged community volunteers in planting seedlings and site maintenance.                                
COMPLETED 2014
Phase III: Clearing the remaining undesirable trees and engaging community volunteers in planting seedlings, building a Traditional Hawaiian Hale, and continued maintenance and outreach.                     
IN PROGRESS FOR 2015

PROJECT NEEDS:
$4,500 for COMPLETION of PHASE III tree removal, planting, hale building workshops, site maintenance and continued outreach education!

Your donation will hep support a unique urban forest restoration and education exhibit at the Pana'ewa Zoo! 

WHY THE PANA'EWA DISCOVERY FOREST MATTERS:
The Pana'ewa zoo Discovery Forest is providing education, recreation, and volunteer opportunities for community residents and visitors. In addition to community volunteers, students from Kamehameha Schools, Pacific Quest, Ka'u High, Kiwanis Kids, Prince Jonah Kūhiō Kalani‘ana‘ole Elementary and Intermediate School, and Malamalama Waldorf School have all participated in the creation of the Discovery Forest. As of January 2015, over 300 volunteers have helped to create and maintain the Discovery Forest.
In March, Certified Traditional Hawaiian Hale Builder “Unko Waltah” began working with community volunteers to build a traditional Hawaiian Hale at the Discovery Forest. This important aspect of the project is helping to perpetuate the Hawaiian culture by revitalizing and sharing the skills of building a structure out of materials from the ‘āina. Materials for the Hale Ku’ai/Papa’a will come from Pana’ewa lands. Hale workshops are being held every 1.5months until structure is completed. To participate in an upcoming Hale building workshop contact Heather                              @ hfia@hawaiiforest.org



Help Continue Student Education and Community Involvement of Hawaii's Forests! 
PROJECT AFFILIATES:
MAHALO ‘ĀINA: Give Back to the Forest is a new initiative of the Hawai‘i Forest Institute.  In partnership with the Hawai‘i Forest Industry Association (HFIA), the goal of MAHALO ‘ĀINA is to expand our community partnerships and gain support for the protection and perpetuation of Hawaii’s forest ecosystems.  Funds raised through MAHALO ‘ĀINA are helping to support:  Propagation, outplanting, and long-term care of plantings; Site maintenance; Cultural and environmental education programs; and Coordination and promotional activities.
MAHALO ‘ĀINA is not simply a tree planting initiative. In addition to planting trees, MAHALO ‘ĀINA is helping to support total ecosystem management and providing forest stewardship opportunities and educational programs at over a dozen project sites throughout the state. 
Support other HFIA and HFI projects HERE: http://www.mahaloaina.org/

<p><b>The Problem</b></p>
<p>According to the United Nations, measured in carbon dioxide equivalent, animal agriculture generates 18 percent of greenhouse gas emissions, and 37 percent of methane emissions. Methane, a byproduct of animal waste digestion, is more than 25 times as powerful as carbon dioxide at trapping heat in our atmosphere.  As these greenhouse gases accelerate, climate change  scientists say they will increasingly lead to catastrophic disasters around the world.</p>
<p>Animal agriculture is a major source of air pollution. Decaying wastes stored in manure lagoons on-farm or shipped offsite, release hazardous gases. Such as methane and the colorless and highly toxic hydrogen sulfide. This can lead to a multitude of serious public health problems, widespread environmental degradation, and climate change. After monitoring a medium-sized farm, in Minnesota  it was revealed hydrogen sulfide emissions there were high enough to cause nausea, headaches, and diminished quality of life among those living in the area. In fact, hydrogen sulfide is one of the most dangerous pollutants emitted by farms.</p>
<p>The amount of manure produced by animals raised for food in the U.S. is roughly 100 times the amount of sewage treated by our municipal wastewater plants. This raw manure is not processed through any sort of waste treatment facility such as with human waste. Left untreated, the outgassing biogas harms the environment while allowing a valuable potential fuel source to escape unharvested.</p>
<p>Dairy farms will always produce biogas in abundance.  We cannot change this; but what we can change is how we deal with it.  </p>
<p><b>The Solution</b><br/></p>Our highly experienced team will harvest and clean harmful biogas and transform it into fuel that can be put directly into the gas pipeline grid. This process provides two incredible environmental benefits: the elimination of biogas, and the addition of sustainable transportation fuel.<br/><br/>
<p>Biomethane (CNG: compressed natural gas) offers positive emissions properties, releasing significantly less emissions compared to other fossil fuel sources, such as gasoline or diesel, which contain dangerous properties that are absent in biogas. Our new process is both easier and less expensive: our materials will be modular standardized components, which will increase installation and maintenance ease while significantly minimizing costs, and is particularly well suited for small and medium-sized farms.<br/></p>
<p>Often, sustainable agricultural methods are available only to large scale farms. Yet farms on the smaller side, while receptive to sustainability, often lack access or capital to invest in such highly priced methods. Nowadays, this cycle of detrimental agriculture seems inevitable. However, by focusing on small and medium size farms, we are breaking this cycle of environmental degradation and combating one of the worst contributors to global climate change.Turning it into a sustainable, cost-efficient fuel. </p>

Με την Ολυμπιάδα Σπόρων η Διεθνής Συνέλευση των Πολιτών θα ταξιδεύει σε διαφορετικά μέρη του κόσμου. Θα διαδίδεται έτσι ένα μήνυμα για την ανάπτυξη των σπόρων, μιας νέας κουλτούρας βασισμένης στην αγάπη και στην συνεργασία για τη διατήρηση της γης και των σπόρων, για τον αέρα, μια κουλτούρα που δεν διαχωρίζει το φυσικό περιβάλλον από τον άνθρωπο. Αναφερόμαστε ειδικά σε σπόρους παραδοσιακών ποικιλιών που έχουν διατηρηθεί από τους αγρότες εδώ και χιλιάδες χρόνια</p>
<p>Η ιδέα της Ολυμπιάκης Γιορτής Σπόρων</p>
<p>Η Ολυμπιάκη Γιορτή Σπόρων είναι ο εορτασμός της ανάπτυξης του σπόρου της συνεργασίας με τη γη, το νερό, το σπόρο και άλλους ανθρώπους.</p>
<p>Εκεχειρία με τη φύση. Αυτή είναι εμπνευσμένη από τους αρχαίους ολυμπιακούς αγώνες όπου οι πόλεμοι σταματούσαν κατά τη διάρκεια των αγώνων και επικρατούσε η ειρήνη. Έτσι με αυτή την αναφορά ζητάμε εκεχειρία με τη φύση. Σας καλούμε να συνεργαστείτε με τη φύση, να σταματήσει η χρήση δηλητηρίων, η μόλυνση του αέρα του νερού και του εδάφους. Προτείνουμε για ένα μήνα να βρείτε τρόπους να συνεργαστείτε με τις άλλες μορφές ζωής.</p>
<p>Εστιάζουμε τη προσοχή μας σε θετικές δράσεις που γίνονται στον πλανήτη, σε θετικές δράσεις που μπορούμε να εφαρμόσουμε. Με τη σκέψη μας και τις πράξεις μας μπορούμε να ενδυναμώσουμε τις θετικές απόψεις .</p>
<p>Μοιραζόμαστε την ευθύνη για όσα συμβαίνουν στον πλανήτη εργαζόμενοι για τη συνεργασία και την αγάπη.</p>

1η Ολυμπιάκη Γιορτή Σπόρων και 17η Γιορτή Σπόρων του Πελίτι, από 19-22 Απριλίου 2017
Η Ολυμπιάκη Γιορτή Σπόρων (Olympic Seed Festival) προτάθηκε από το Πελίτι (www.peliti.gr) κατά τη διάρκεια της Παγκόσμιας Συνέλευσης των πολιτών που έγινε στις 14-16 Οκτωβρίου 2016 στη Χάγη. Η Συνέλευση των πολιτών διοργανώθηκε από τη Navdanya (http://navdanya.org) και το Seed Freedom (http://seedfreedom.info). Με την Ολυμπιάδα Σπόρων η Διεθνής Συνέλευση των Πολιτών θα ταξιδεύει σε διαφορετικά μέρη του κόσμου. Θα διαδίδεται έτσι ένα μήνυμα για την ανάπτυξη των σπόρων, μιας νέας κουλτούρας βασισμένης στην αγάπη και στην συνεργασία για τη διατήρηση της γης και των σπόρων, για τον αέρα, μια κουλτούρα που δεν διαχωρίζει το φυσικό περιβάλλον από τον άνθρωπο. Αναφερόμαστε ειδικά σε σπόρους παραδοσιακών ποικιλιών που έχουν διατηρηθεί από τους αγρότες εδώ και χιλιάδες χρόνια
Η ιδέα της Ολυμπιάκης Γιορτής Σπόρων
Η Ολυμπιάκη Γιορτή Σπόρων είναι ο εορτασμός της ανάπτυξης του σπόρου της συνεργασίας με τη γη, το νερό, το σπόρο και άλλους ανθρώπους.
Εκεχειρία με τη φύση. Αυτή είναι εμπνευσμένη από τους αρχαίους ολυμπιακούς αγώνες όπου οι πόλεμοι σταματούσαν κατά τη διάρκεια των αγώνων και επικρατούσε η ειρήνη. Έτσι με αυτή την αναφορά ζητάμε εκεχειρία με τη φύση. Σας καλούμε να συνεργαστείτε με τη φύση, να σταματήσει η χρήση δηλητηρίων, η μόλυνση του αέρα του νερού και του εδάφους. Προτείνουμε για ένα μήνα να βρείτε τρόπους να συνεργαστείτε με τις άλλες μορφές ζωής.
Εστιάζουμε τη προσοχή μας σε θετικές δράσεις που γίνονται στον πλανήτη, σε θετικές δράσεις που μπορούμε να εφαρμόσουμε. Με τη σκέψη μας και τις πράξεις μας μπορούμε να ενδυναμώσουμε τις θετικές απόψεις .
Μοιραζόμαστε την ευθύνη για όσα συμβαίνουν στον πλανήτη εργαζόμενοι για τη συνεργασία και την αγάπη.
Η πρώτη Ολυμπιακή Γιορτή Σπόρων, οργανώνεται από το Πελίτι, www.peliti.gr
Και υποστηρίζεται από:
Το δήμο Παρανεστίου http://paranesti.gr
Το Κέντρο Περιβαλλοντικής Εκπαίδευσης Παρανεστίου http://kpeparanestiou.gr
Το παγκόσμιο κίνημα για την ελευθερία των σπόρων, SeedFreedom, http://seedfreedom.info

<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">is b</span>orn as a conservation study addressed to endangered and Vulnerable African birds of prey. The project, focused in particular on Secretary Bird, has been approved by TAWIRI (Tanzania Wildlife Research Institute) during the 45° Research Program Committee Meeting.</p>

<p>Genetic analyses are becoming an essential prerequisite to properly assess the extent of diversity of endangered species or subspecies. However, very little genetic data are currently available for large African raptors (Seibold and Helbig 1995; Roques et al. 2004; Mahmood et al. 2014). For this reason, we will include a preliminary assessment, in the geographic areas under study, of the sequence variation of the entire mitochondrial DNA (mitogenome) for this species.</p>
<h3><strong>Goals and objectives</strong></h3>
<p>Periodic checking of the presence and abundance of the aforementioned species in these territories will provide important information on its health and conservation status. The primary objectives are:</p>
<p>-to estimate the total entity of the recorded populations;</p>
<p>-to describe the numerical and distributional variations;</p>
<p>-to assist local authorities in protecting this extraordinary bird species;</p>
<p>-to create work teams of students, researchers from all over the world.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Genetic study</strong></p>
<p>Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), generally about 17,000 base pairs (bp) long in animals, may appear meaningless in size when compared to the nuclear genome. However, mtDNA sequence variation has proven to be a powerful genetic record of the relationships between species, subspecies, populations and individuals. In contrast to the autosomal markers, mtDNA is not reshuffled from generation to generation, but is inherited nearly unchanged along strict maternal lines of descent. The process of its molecular differentiation, which occurs exclusively through the sequential accumulation of new mutations, is also relatively rapid, often taking place during and after the process of dispersal of the population/species into different regions. Thus subsets of mtDNA variation (haplogroups = groups of haplotypes) often tend to be restricted to particular geographic areas and population groups. It should be noted that, as a single maternally-inherited locus, mtDNA can not reflect the whole complexity of past demographic processes, but allows an extremely detailed reconstruction of the nesting relationships within a phylogeny, a feature that can be extremely informative for dating splitting events, especially when the sequence variation of entire mitogenomes is considered. Initially driven by studies in humans, as it often occurs in genetics, mtDNA studies in animal species are now entering a new phase: from the analysis of short segments – generally less or at most around 1,000 bp in length (either a portion of the control-region or of single protein-coding genes such as COI, ND2, cytb) – to the blossoming of analyses at the level of the entire mitogenome.</p>

is born as a conservation study addressed to endangered and Vulnerable African birds of prey. The project, focused in particular on Secretary Bird, has been approved by TAWIRI (Tanzania Wildlife Research Institute) during the 45° Research Program Committee Meeting.
The Secretary Bird, Sagittarius serpentarius, is the only representative of the Sagittariidae family. After noticing that the sightings of this species are increasingly difficult, we decided to conduct a first accurate census in the area of Serengeti/Ngorongoro and it will be relevant to carry it out to prove the effective reduction.

<p>In this two-month journey, we will drive (suffer) in a tiny 2003' Toyota Yaris <strong>(w/o A.C.</strong>) through 21 countries including some of the most interesting and daunting territories, such as Iran and Turkmenistan.

<p>Cool Earth is the charity that works alongside indigenous villages to halt rainforest destruction.</p>
<p>We know that saving the rainforest isn’t a new idea. Managing to do it is.</p>
<p>Over the last 40 years, half the world’s rainforests have been destroyed. That’s why Cool Earth decided to go about things differently.</p>
<p>Cool Earth doesn't create reserves or put up fences. They don’t buy land. Instead, they put indigenous people back in control of the world’s most endangered rainforest.</p>
<p>These people have lived in the forest for countless generations. Their homes are now on the  front line of deforestation. They have the most to lose from deforestation.</p>
<p>By building better incomes, better schools and better clinics, Cool Earth gives their partner villages the resources they need to keep their forest intact.</p>
<p>Cool Earth is now working alongside 65 rainforest villages throughout the world.</p>
<p>These partner villages are protecting over 350,000 acres of forest that lie directly in the path of chainsaws and bulldozers.</p>
<p>The clever part is that this forest is forming a shield to make the neighbouring forest inaccessible  to loggers – saving millions of acres of further forest.</p>
<p>At least 90% of each donation to Cool Earth goes directly to their projects. With this support, Cool Earth can put in place the simple steps that change the fate of at-risk rainforest and the lives of their indigenous partners.</p>
