<p>No, I did not spell mermaid wrong, (well technically I guess I did)  </p>

<p> Now you are probably asking what we do and why should I get involved?</p>
<p> Well my story goes a little something like this:</p>
<p>A Girl and Friend have an awesome idea (lightbulb) to open a kid's spa and party place in Cape May, NJ where there is little to do with children other than the beach, mini golf and few awesome kid's camp programs. How many times can you ride a Ferris Wheel in one summer? Am I right? Off season cut all aforementioned activities out of the picture completely.  Girl and Friend plan and plan and plan and then decide to plan just a little more. Things are looking good right? Wrong. Friend's husband's job gets transferred and Friend moves wicked far away leaving Girl sad but determined to make all of the hard work and effort that was put into this work! Many said it couldn't be done, especially by a Girl. BUT and this is a really big but...with a very supportive husband, family and kickass friends to lean on for support and inspiration Girl found herself a real deal business owner! </p>
<p>Holy Cow!! Take that naysayers! </p>

</h3>I recently accepted the really awesome opportunity to start my very own Mary Kay business. I am SO excited about this, and very excited to tell you how you can help me get there!<br/><br/>Some more background information here--- In just a few short months I am going to marry a ridiculously amazing fellow, and we are going to relocate to Coeur d'Alene so he can continue going to school and pursuing his degree. We are so excited to start this new chapter of our lives, and I am excited to get a good start on a small business that I know I can fully utilize and/or fall back on as needed for financial support and security. <br/><br/>We know things will be tight for a while as we work to get a grasp on living as independent adults, and having to think about things like rent, bills and everything else that goes with that, so I can't wait to get my Mary Kay up and running so I know I can count on it!<br/>
</div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get <br/>
</h3>My ultimate monetary goal to get this started is $1800. This is the entirety of the amount I will need to join Mary Kay as a Star Consultant. <br/>I can guarantee that, barring the possibility of raising more than I technically need, this is the sole cause for which this amount will go towards.<br/><br/><b>Now Here's the Fun Part! <br/><br/>What do you get out of this?<br/></b>By now you may have noticed the list of perks off to the side. I am SO excited to be able to offer these perks, because they all rely 100% on my own talent, abilities and determination. I want nothing more than to be able to start my Mary Kay business through artistic tactics that my backers can benefit from.<br/><br/>So here is how it's going to work. I am going to spend the next three weeks spreading the word, gaining backers, and promoting my campaign. And then, in the several weeks following, I will make good on those benefits. Sending things off, delivering, whatever it takes to get you your awesome benefit! If you want your benefit by a certain day (following the end of the campaign, of course) or in time for a special occasion, etc, just let me know and we can ALWAYS work something out!<br/><br/>Have questions concerning any of the perks?<br/>Shoot me an email! ---&gt; brass_bird@hotmail.com<br/>
</div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges <br/>
</h3>More than anything, I want everyone involved with this campaign to be as informed as possible! Even if I do not completely meet my goal, I will still be able to get my business up off the ground, with the remaining funds likely coming from savings or a loan.<br/><br/>I want to avoid at all costs going into debt over this, or even having a card or loan to pay off. My future husband and I will be starting fresh, and the last thing I want to bring into our marriage is a credit card that needs paid off! <br/>
</div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p>-Spread the word! Let your friends and friends of friends know! <br/></p>
<p>-Share on your Facebook pages, blogs, Twitter, whatever social networking platform you prefer! Any sharing is good sharing!</p>

Hi. My name is Connie Muller, and I am the National Sales Manager for a national microlender in South Africa by the name of Bridge.
Bridge Online Presence  :  http://www.bridge.co.za
Connie Muller LinkedIn  :  Click here  https://za.linkedin.com/pub/connie-muller/1b/a3b/249/en

 As part of our contribution to the community, we are involved in a variety of services that aim to uplift and educate disadvantaged residents in need in the local areas of our 50 branches thought the country, starting with the Tshwane Metro (3 x branches). Some of the services include: - Sport Initiatives ( Sponsorships) - Rewards Initiatives (School Projects) - Financial Education Drive - Family Wellbeing and relationships, women and children (Focus Groups) - Health and Safety (Focus Groups) - Unemployment ( Training, Skillsets & Income Opportunities) A wide range of educational upliftment, training etc is available. Facilitation of Job creation between employers, suppliers and job seekers.

One of the first projects has been to create an infrastructure where 
people can receive education and training extending over a range of 
community needs.
 Bridge, a national corporate in the financial 
services industry has willingly donated floor space, tables, chairs and 
computers for this purpose at their Sunnyside branch in 
Tshwane (Pretoria), and a number of other branches throughout the country.
 The Bridge community portal currently provides for the following: 1. A range of focus groups such as mentioned above. 2. Income opportunities 3. A range of training
The campaign to further fund the project is to provide the following: 1. PC connectivity to internet to provide free online training 2. Tutor and supervisor costs 3. Course fees for students taking paid courses. 4. Equipment maintenance.
South Africa has a high unemployment rate, and the informal sector is very underdeveloped.
There is a need for skill development at all levels. The following pictures show the typical kind of community that we work in.








Current Facebook Group started to support project:https://www.facebook.com/groups/tshwanecommunityservices/The Facebook page can be found at:https://www.facebook.com/resultswithpeopleThe following pictures show the street view of the Tshwane branch and learning center inside.

   What We Need & What You Get We need $50,000 to fund 50 x branches and their community portals which averages about $1,000 per branch to get them going. Some branches are larger, have more space and resources and other are substantially smaller, so it will vary per branch
*** Any funding exceeding the above will enable us to provide more training and resources to those in need. The goal of $50,000 is therefore relative and can be scaled upwards considerably.
 The funding will be used over the following range of expenses:

Paying for a broadband line and an internet connection at each branch.
Sponsoring students doing both online and offline courses aimed at building skillsets to either empower them as entrepeneurs or get them ready for the workplace.
The above training is mainly provided by outsourced service providers who will require payment.
 There is also the required job function of a community portal supervisor at the larger community centres such as the Tshwane centre above and this needs to be provided for financially.
Maintenance of the PC's.
General operating expenses.


Unique Perks: 
Free, and discounted online training programs developed by and contributed by the training service providers. This list will keep on growing over time.
Discounts on selected services such as those offered at businesses like: http://www.go2webdesign.co.za

Free or discounted business coaching programs.

A donation now will be a lifelong investment in training programs and selected services.


Where the money goes if the goal is not reached: If the goal is not reached, the program will still go ahead but fewer portals will be funded initially.
For example, if only $2,000 is raised, it will enable about 2 x portals be be launched, or 1 x larger portal.
That being said, this campaign will be repeated as regularly as is needed to keep the community portals maintained and growing.    The Impact Your contribution will make the following difference:  You will be instrumental in teaching people how to fish, rather than just provide a fish.
These skills will provide income and living standards for the unemployed, disadvantaged, individuals and families. Connie has been doing similar work in communities for 20 years, and has a good working knowledge of how to get projects like this off the ground. Your contribution will provide the basic needs such as food, clothing and shelter, but not just by contributing cash - rather by upskilling and assisting people to either find employment or to develop and exploit their skills as entrepeneurs .    Risks & Challenges  There is not much in the way of risk in this program other than the following:  The current sponsor Bridge is for some reason unable to provide the premises anymore. In this case we can move existing operations to either a new sponsor and environment, or acquire a low cost premises for the purpose.
 The biggest risk and challenge is to be completely underfunded, which could delay the launch of the project even in one branch.    Other Ways You Can Help Perhaps you just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean you can't help:  Please get the word out to all your friends and contacts and make some noise about the campaign.

<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><b>About Dalieh</b></p>
<p>Dalieh is a unique natural site along the coast of Beirut. It is the last of the coastal headlands, overlooking the emblematic <i>Sakhret el-Raouche</i>, the landmark natural rock formation that dominates Beirut’s view from the sea. It includes a prosperous biodiversity, a rich diversity of geomorphological features, as well as archeological remains. For decades, this area has acted as an active gathering space, and encompassed a vibrant informal economy revolving around fishing, popular fish restaurants, boat touring, peddling, and scenic photography. Families and friends had found in this space a natural destination for weekend picnics, lovers a quiet and idyllic setting, sea-goers a strategic swimming and fishing destination, and communities an adequate setting for the celebration of their festivities.</p>
<p>Perhaps one of Dalieh’s most enduring and distinctive characteristics is the unscripted quality of its setting, allowing for multiple, overlapping –yet never conflicting – activities to occur. For long, the area had operated as an open-access shared space where order was secured through tacit agreements rather than public policing. This is because Dalieh does not fulfill the legal definition of a “public space”: the site is not publicly owned and its activities are not regulated or controlled by state authorities. In Dalieh, property is held privately and the organization and management of social practices, activities, and/or conflicts are worked through informal agreements.</p>
<p>Having practiced and used the area for generations, city dwellers had paid little attention towards property ownership and/or management. However, following a number of recent events, a few of the area’s users became aware that Dalieh is privately owned.  Since summer 2014, rapid transformations have abruptly interrupted Dalieh’s social and economic life: fishermen were evicted, their stalls and restaurants demolished, and a new fence now limits access to the area (and the sea) and obstructs the view. Numerous clues point to the looming threat of a luxurious private development to take over the zone and stitch it to similar developments that have mushroomed over the past decade along the city’s coast.</p>
<br/><p><b></b></p>
<p><b>Who we are</b></p>
<p>In an effort to halt these transformations, the “Civil Campaign to Protect the Dalieh of Raouche” was established in March 2013 to advocate for the preservation and enhancement of the role of Dalieh as an open-access shared space for all city dwellers and visitors.  The Dalieh Campaign is a coalition of individuals and non-governmental organizations who share a strong commitment to the preservation of Beirut’s shared spaces, ecological and cultural diversity, as the pillars of the city’s livability.</p>
<br/><p></p>
<p><b>About the competition</b></p>
<p>This idea-competition has been initiated by the Dalieh Campaign to provide a platform to advocate for the protection, preservation, maintenance, and enhancement of Dalieh as a shared openspace: unique in its ecological and geological features, and accessible to a wide public of users irrespective of national, gender, ethnic, religious, social, or other belongings.

المنطقة، فطُرد منها الصيادون، وهُدمت أكشاكهم ومطاعمهم، واستحدث سياج يحد من
الدخول إلى المنطقة والوصول إلى البحر كما يحجب الرؤية.
هذا وتشير أدلّة

الحفاظ على دور الدالية وتعزيزه كمساحة مشتركة ومتاحة لكافة سكّان المدينة
وزائريها. يجمع الائتلاف بين الشركاء التزامهم/ن القوي بالحفاظ على المساحات
المشتركة في بيروت، وكذلك حماية التنوّع البيئي والثقافي كأساس لإمكانية العيش في
المدينة</p>
<p>يضمّ الائتلاف مواطنين/ات، أهلاً
وأبناءً وبنات، من الصغار والكبار، ملتزمين/ات بحماية مساحات بيروت المشتركة،
وبالتحديد الواجهة البحرية فيها، بصفتها ضرورة للحفاظ على إمكانية العيش في

القانونية والمدنية على حماية موقع الدالية كمساحة مشتركة، مجانية، ومفتوحة
للعامّة.</p>
<p>وانطلقت الحملة في تشرين الثاني من العام 2013 عبر نشر عريضة على
وسائل التواصل الاجتماعي، تطوّرت في ما بعد الى حملةٍ اتخذت من""إرفع ورشتك عن روشتنا"" شعاراً لها. وفي خلال
العام الماضي، عملت ""الحملة المدنية""

المنطقة، فطُرد منها الصيادون، وهُدمت أكشاكهم ومطاعمهم، واستحدث سياج يحد من
الدخول إلى المنطقة والوصول إلى البحر كما يحجب الرؤية.
هذا وتشير أدلّة
عديدة إلى تهديد يلوح في الأفق، يتمثّل في مشروع استثماري لتطوير المنطقة على طراز
فاخر، يلحقها بمشروعات أخرى مشابِهة تكاثرت في العقد الأخير على طول ساحل المدينة

من نحن

""الحملة الأهلية للحفاظ على دالية الروشة"" هي ائتلاف
مكوّن من منظمات غير حكومية وأفراد اجتمعوا معاً منذ ١٣ آذار ٢٠١٤ للمناصرة من أجل
الحفاظ على دور الدالية وتعزيزه كمساحة مشتركة ومتاحة لكافة سكّان المدينة
وزائريها. يجمع الائتلاف بين الشركاء التزامهم/ن القوي بالحفاظ على المساحات
المشتركة في بيروت، وكذلك حماية التنوّع البيئي والثقافي كأساس لإمكانية العيش في
المدينة
يضمّ الائتلاف مواطنين/ات، أهلاً
وأبناءً وبنات، من الصغار والكبار، ملتزمين/ات بحماية مساحات بيروت المشتركة،
وبالتحديد الواجهة البحرية فيها، بصفتها ضرورة للحفاظ على إمكانية العيش في
المدينة. كما يضمّ الائتلاف أفراداً ومجموعات بيئية وثقافية ومدنية، تعمل بالسبل
القانونية والمدنية على حماية موقع الدالية كمساحة مشتركة، مجانية، ومفتوحة
للعامّة.
وانطلقت الحملة في تشرين الثاني من العام 2013 عبر نشر عريضة على
وسائل التواصل الاجتماعي، تطوّرت في ما بعد الى حملةٍ اتخذت من""إرفع ورشتك عن روشتنا"" شعاراً لها. وفي خلال
العام الماضي، عملت ""الحملة المدنية"" 
على توجيه الرسائل الرسمية إلى الوزارات المعنية، وتنظيم النشاطات في
الدالية، وإعداد أبحاث قانونية وبيئية، وتصميم الشعارات والصور والفيديوهات للترويج للدالية

عن المسابقة

انبثقت
فكرة المسابقة كمنهج للمناصرة من أجل الحفاظ على الدالية مساحة مشتركة مفتوحة
للجميع من دون أية اعتبارات للانتماءات القومية والجندرية والإثنية والدينية
وسواها. وتتوجه المسابقة بالدعوة لفرق المهنيين/ات متعددي/ات الاختصاص
والمواطنين/ات المعنيين/ات من أجل طرح رؤى
مغايرة لإعادة تنظيم الدالية مكانياً وبرمجياً ومؤسسياً.
وعليه، فإننا نتوجه
إلى كافة الزملاء والأصدقاء وسكان المدينة من المهتمين/ات بإمكانية رسم
مستقبلاً حضرياً غير إقصائي مسؤولاً من الناحية البيئية يسمح بالتعددية، ونحثّهم
على الاستجابة لهذه الدعوة. كذلك فإننا نشجّع المشاركين/ات على توظيف مهاراتهم/ن المهنية وقدراتهم/ن الابتكارية في
صوغ تصميمات تخطيطية فعلية. نأمل في أن تغدو تلك التصميمات بمثابة
نقطة انطلاق لنقاشات تصوّرية قادرة على تشكيل تحالفات واسعة النطاق للمناصرة من
أجل بناء مدن غير اقصائية وملائمة للعيش، تحكمها مبادئ العدالة الاجتماعية بدلاً
عن المصالح الاقتصادية المحدودة

<h2><b>Short
Summary</b></h2>
<p>Two dads, who are also scout leaders
and web design/programmers, brought you the first free online scout advancement
tracking system three years ago. Upcoming program changes in the BSA means that
while we continue to support the existing Cub Scout program in ScoutTrax.org,
we are building the new program to be released on our site by June 1st 2015! We
need your help to enhance ScoutTrax.org with these changes to provide our users
with a leading edge experience, all while keeping it free.</p>
<p>We are a non-profit, free for
everyone, online advancement tracking system that currently supports over 27,000 scouts, parents
&amp; leaders in taking the headache &amp; guesswork out of tracking Cub and Boy Scouts in the
BSA program.</p><p>What is amazing is that we have spent no money to advertise. All of our user base comes from word of mouth or searching the internet. <br/></p>
<p>With version 2 of ScoutTrax complete, most of our time is now spent in supporting members and responding to their
questions. We have been making big changes to accommodate the BSA's program
updates. The best way to release a quality product by the deadline is to get
more professionals to help us finish these changes. We are raising this money
to get that extra help. </p>
<h2><b>What
We Need &amp; What You Get</b></h2>
<p>If you are a scout, parent or leader
in the BSA, you had us at hello. <br/></p>
<ul>
<li>Contribute nothing and we're still giving the site to
     everyone - free!</li>
<li>Help us meet this goal and you will allow us to get more help to
     program the new scouting changes on time.</li>
<li>Help us surpass our funding goal and we will start adding the following features: <br/>
</li>
</ul><ul>
</ul><ol>
<li>Multiple parent &amp; read-only log ins with calendering.</li>
<li>Add counselor access &amp; sign off. Great for camps and merit badge ""pow wows."" </li>
<li>Auto fill, one click, virtual Blue Cards and printing. <i>You know you want it.</i><br/>
</li>
</ol><ul>
</ul>
<h2><b>The
Impact on Scouting<br/></b></h2>
<ul>
<li>Make it easier for you. Sometimes big non-profits forget the basic needs of their volunteers. ScoutTrax is actively filling those needs. <br/>
</li>
<li>Keep the scouts' records at their fingertips. Records
     will never get lost.</li>
<li>Make scouting a much better experience and keep our
     youth engaged in a great program.</li>
</ul>
<h2><b>Risks
&amp; Challenges</b></h2>
<p>There are no risks. We have taken
all of them by donating 3 years of development... over 1000 hours! You
will just help make it faster, better and stronger!</p>

Summary
Two dads, who are also scout leaders
and web design/programmers, brought you the first free online scout advancement
tracking system three years ago. Upcoming program changes in the BSA means that
while we continue to support the existing Cub Scout program in ScoutTrax.org,
we are building the new program to be released on our site by June 1st 2015! We
need your help to enhance ScoutTrax.org with these changes to provide our users
with a leading edge experience, all while keeping it free.
We are a non-profit, free for
everyone, online advancement tracking system that currently supports over 27,000 scouts, parents
& leaders in taking the headache & guesswork out of tracking Cub and Boy Scouts in the
BSA program.What is amazing is that we have spent no money to advertise. All of our user base comes from word of mouth or searching the internet. 
With version 2 of ScoutTrax complete, most of our time is now spent in supporting members and responding to their
questions. We have been making big changes to accommodate the BSA's program
updates. The best way to release a quality product by the deadline is to get
more professionals to help us finish these changes. We are raising this money
to get that extra help. 
What
We Need & What You Get
If you are a scout, parent or leader
in the BSA, you had us at hello. 

Contribute nothing and we're still giving the site to
     everyone - free!
Help us meet this goal and you will allow us to get more help to
     program the new scouting changes on time.
Help us surpass our funding goal and we will start adding the following features: 



Multiple parent & read-only log ins with calendering.
Add counselor access & sign off. Great for camps and merit badge ""pow wows."" 
Auto fill, one click, virtual Blue Cards and printing. You know you want it.



The
Impact on Scouting

Make it easier for you. Sometimes big non-profits forget the basic needs of their volunteers. ScoutTrax is actively filling those needs. 

Keep the scouts' records at their fingertips. Records
     will never get lost.
Make scouting a much better experience and keep our
     youth engaged in a great program.

Risks
& Challenges
There are no risks. We have taken
all of them by donating 3 years of development... over 1000 hours! You
will just help make it faster, better and stronger!

<p><span><b></b></span></p>
<p><span>Welcome to the #whyiloveAfrica campaign! #whyiloveAfrica is an initiative to change the negative perception of the African continent, and instead showcase all that is AWESOME about Africa. </span></p>
<br/><h4><b>Three reasons you should support this campaign:</b></h4>
<ol>
<li><p>You LOVE Africa! (the culture, the food, the fashion, the beauty...there’s so much to love)</p></li>
<li><p>You’re tired of the continent being portrayed as poverty-stricken, war-torn and backwards and want to do something CREATIVE about it.</p></li>
<li><p>You want to be a part of a powerful global MOVEMENT.<br/><br/><br/></p></li>
</ol>
<h2><span><b>What is #whyiloveAfrica all about? </b></span></h2>
<p>My name is Julian B. Kiganda—proud African and founder of <a href=""http://www.boldandfearless.me/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Bold &amp; Fearless.</a> I was born in Uganda and moved to the U.S. with my family as a toddler. It wasn't until my teenage years that I learned to embrace my culture. But that only happened once I came to understand the diversity and beauty of, not just my country, but the entire continent. </p>
<br/><p>Unfortunately, the media often portrays the continent as dark and hopeless. And this is why I've spent so much of my life working to <a href=""http://boldandfearless.me/africans-and-pet-zebras/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">break down stereotypes</a> that persist about Africa. Over the years, I've led projects and <a href=""http://www.ad4change.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">organizations</a> which have worked to change the negative perceptions of Africa. On my site, Bold &amp; Fearless, I <a href=""http://boldandfearless.me/?s=notable%20africa"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">regularly feature Africans</a> who are re-shaping the continent's brand.</p>
<br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1443398459/p5gzpgrf08rfknt4j1nr.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/><br/><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""></span>
</div><div>
<h2><span>Why is branding important?</span></h2>
<p>When it comes to success, perception is reality. That’s why corporations and countries invest billions of dollars every year in their brands. As a brand strategist with more than 17 years of experience, I understand the importance of combining stories and images to shape public perception of a brand. </p>
<p>The beautiful thing is, with the advent of social media, <b>we have the opportunity to tell Africa’s stories on our own terms without having to rely on media which is often biased. </b>If you look at how the Apples, Chinas, and Nikes of the the world have become respected and highly profitable entities, one key to their success was investing resources into promoting their brands.</p>
<br/><h2>Did you know?</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><b>6 out of the 10 fastest growing economies in the world are in Africa;</b></p></li>
<li><p><b>There are 29 billionaires (and hundreds of millionaires) on the continent;</b></p></li>
<li><p><b>There are more 100 million Africans on the continent using Facebook. But these facts are usually eclipsed by the negativity of mainstream media. </b></p></li>
</ul>
<br/><p>This is why I was thrilled to accept the invitation to join the Brand Counsel of <a href=""http://www.brandafrica.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><b>Brand Africa</b></a>, an organization based in South Africa which is working to transform the image of Africa. Excited to get to work as a Counsel member<b>, </b><u style=""font-weight: bold;"">all I planned to do was attend the organization's annual awards event this October in South Africa recognizing the biggest and best brands in Africa,</u><b> but then…</b></p>
<br/>Then I realized, this trip needed to be so much more. So the trip has turned into a movement. A movement I need you to join. <br/><span style=""background-color: initial;""><br/><br/><b style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 30px; letter-spacing: 1px; line-height: 38px;"">Why does this matter?</b></span>
</div><div>
<ul>
<li><p><b>If we want the next generation to appreciate and embrace their roots,</b> we have to show them images and tell them stories that foster cultural pride. </p></li>
<li><p><b>If we want to attract more investment and opportunities to the continent and help economically empower more individuals on the continent, </b>we have to showcase the side of Africa that many never see. </p></li>
<li><p><b>If we want to truly help Africa rise, </b>we have to understand that image is everything. And then, we need to do our part to change it for the better.</p></li>
</ul>
<br/><h2>How the Funds Will Be Used</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><b>Getting to South Africa</b> (travel &amp; accommodations: You'll be able to join me virtually on my trip as I broadcast it LIVE on <a href=""http://www.periscope.tv/BoldFearless1"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Periscope</a> and share on social media, inviting the world to see the beauty and diversity of South Africa as the first stop on the #whyiloveAfrica tour);</p></li>
<li><p><b>Producing the #whyiloveAfrica book</b> (e-book and print versions): This book will paint a picture of Africa through the eyes of those who love the continent the most--YOU! It will feature the stories, food, fashion, natural beauty, culture, music and arts, and all those things that make Africa amazing. (For donations of $100 and up, you can get your own digital or print copy of this gorgeous book.);</p></li>
<li><p><b>Launching the #whyiloveAfrica T-shirt line</b> (see below for the first two designs in the series);</p></li>
<li>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">My goal is to exceed the $5000 fundraising target and <b>expand the scope of this project</b> to include the #whyiloveAfrica web site, traveling exhibit and video series. This is just the beginning. <b>And you can be part of it.</b><br/></span><br/>

Welcome to the #whyiloveAfrica campaign! #whyiloveAfrica is an initiative to change the negative perception of the African continent, and instead showcase all that is AWESOME about Africa. 
Three reasons you should support this campaign:

You LOVE Africa! (the culture, the food, the fashion, the beauty...there’s so much to love)
You’re tired of the continent being portrayed as poverty-stricken, war-torn and backwards and want to do something CREATIVE about it.
You want to be a part of a powerful global MOVEMENT.

What is #whyiloveAfrica all about? 
My name is Julian B. Kiganda—proud African and founder of Bold & Fearless. I was born in Uganda and moved to the U.S. with my family as a toddler. It wasn't until my teenage years that I learned to embrace my culture. But that only happened once I came to understand the diversity and beauty of, not just my country, but the entire continent. 
Unfortunately, the media often portrays the continent as dark and hopeless. And this is why I've spent so much of my life working to break down stereotypes that persist about Africa. Over the years, I've led projects and organizations which have worked to change the negative perceptions of Africa. On my site, Bold & Fearless, I regularly feature Africans who are re-shaping the continent's brand.



Why is branding important?
When it comes to success, perception is reality. That’s why corporations and countries invest billions of dollars every year in their brands. As a brand strategist with more than 17 years of experience, I understand the importance of combining stories and images to shape public perception of a brand. 
The beautiful thing is, with the advent of social media, we have the opportunity to tell Africa’s stories on our own terms without having to rely on media which is often biased. If you look at how the Apples, Chinas, and Nikes of the the world have become respected and highly profitable entities, one key to their success was investing resources into promoting their brands.
Did you know?

6 out of the 10 fastest growing economies in the world are in Africa;
There are 29 billionaires (and hundreds of millionaires) on the continent;
There are more 100 million Africans on the continent using Facebook. But these facts are usually eclipsed by the negativity of mainstream media. 

This is why I was thrilled to accept the invitation to join the Brand Counsel of Brand Africa, an organization based in South Africa which is working to transform the image of Africa. Excited to get to work as a Counsel member, all I planned to do was attend the organization's annual awards event this October in South Africa recognizing the biggest and best brands in Africa, but then…
Then I realized, this trip needed to be so much more. So the trip has turned into a movement. A movement I need you to join. Why does this matter?


If we want the next generation to appreciate and embrace their roots, we have to show them images and tell them stories that foster cultural pride. 
If we want to attract more investment and opportunities to the continent and help economically empower more individuals on the continent, we have to showcase the side of Africa that many never see. 
If we want to truly help Africa rise, we have to understand that image is everything. And then, we need to do our part to change it for the better.

How the Funds Will Be Used

Getting to South Africa (travel & accommodations: You'll be able to join me virtually on my trip as I broadcast it LIVE on Periscope and share on social media, inviting the world to see the beauty and diversity of South Africa as the first stop on the #whyiloveAfrica tour);
Producing the #whyiloveAfrica book (e-book and print versions): This book will paint a picture of Africa through the eyes of those who love the continent the most--YOU! It will feature the stories, food, fashion, natural beauty, culture, music and arts, and all those things that make Africa amazing. (For donations of $100 and up, you can get your own digital or print copy of this gorgeous book.);
Launching the #whyiloveAfrica T-shirt line (see below for the first two designs in the series);

My goal is to exceed the $5000 fundraising target and expand the scope of this project to include the #whyiloveAfrica web site, traveling exhibit and video series. This is just the beginning. And you can be part of it.

Why Me? Why You?
YOU can help me tell Africa's story and be a part of the solution to make sure the world gets to experience what you and I already know about the beauty and diversity of the continent. As an old African proverb states:""If you want to go quickly, go alone. If you want to go far, go together.""

<p>Edin Durmo, is the founder of the Club.  Together with his team, he works as a guide on
the mountains of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Backcountry skiing, mountaineering,
sports climbing, canyoning, hiking are his specialties.</p>
<p>The nature of Bosnia and Herzegovina is wonderful. Its
mountains are wild and untouched. Even if they are not too high, they present a
unique environment, which has not yet been discovered by mass tourism. </p>
<p>However, Zenica, where Scorpio is based is one industrial
city in the centre of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Unemployment, the legacy of the
conflict in Bosnia and Herzegovina, poverty are all problems affecting Zenica.
These problems are aggravated even more by a difficult environmental situation,
which is caused by a huge steel works company, which is polluting the
environment of the city. </p><p><b>Why we need your help</b></p>
<p>Scorpio is a Club responsible towards its community. Edin
dedicates parts of his free time training young mountaineers, who are members
of his club. In the city, he has built a climbing wall in a public school,
where twice a week, the members of the Club can learn and train rock climbing. </p>
<p>Having in mind the difficult situation of Zenica, Edin created
its own sports center. It is in a hilly area called Smetovi, 400 meters above
Zenica, away from the pollution and fog.</p>
<p>This has become Scorpio Educational and Sports Center. It
serves schools, clubs, NGOs, boy scouts, who have now a unique area to be in
touch with the nature and develop outdoors and climbing skills. The Centre is
also a training ground for the BIH Mountaineering Federation. The main feature
of the Centre is its Adrenaline Tower a 12 meter tower with numerous climbing
routes of all levels, both leading and top rope. </p>
<p>The center was build from Scorpio’s own resources. We are
now planning to expand and repair the climbing area, which was damaged by the
bad weather and harsh winters. </p>
<p>We have already started working, but we need your help to
complete this tower. Besides repairs, we are building a special climbing area
for children who take their first steps on the rock. This is going to be the
ideal escape for the youth from Zenica from the pollution and grey concrete in
the city. </p>
<p>We need your help to complete this. We calculated it is

<h3><b>Think Before You Move</b></h3>
<p>Chess &amp; Community is a 501(c)(3)
non-profit youth empowerment organization committed to developing leadership
and promoting the success of at-risk youth in Athens, Georgia, and the
surrounding areas. Our motto, <i>Think Before You Move,</i> encourages
youth to evaluate their circumstances and plan steps to overcome them. CC uses
chess as a therapeutic model and an instrument for encouraging academic
achievement, community engagement, and the utilization of critical thinking
skills.  </p>
<div>
<h3>Classic City Knights</h3> <p></p>
</div>
<p>The goal of this campaign is to take
the <i>Classic City Knights, </i>CC's resident chess team and mentor group, to
compete in the annual Bum Rush the Board chess tournament in Washington,
D.C. (<a href=""http://www.wblinc.org/bum-rush-2015/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.wblinc.org/bum-rush-2015/</a>).
This annual trip to Washington, D.C. will be a life-changing, eye opening, and
educational experience for these students. They will get the opportunity to meet
other youth from around the country to share in solutions for
empowerment. Not only will they compete in the chess tournament, but they
will also get an opportunity to tour the Nation’s Capital, Howard University, and North
Carolina A&amp;T University. </p><p></p>
<p>On November 13-16, 2015, we will take
12 middle and high school students from Athens, Georgia, to Washington, D.C.
for an annual chess tournament and touring of the Nation’s Capital.  The
students will be chaperoned by three adolescent development mentors. We are
seeking $5,000 to contribute to the following:</p>
<p>•  Round-trip transportation
rental for students and chaperones  </p>
<p>•  Fuel costs (approximately
1,250 miles) and insurance</p>
<p>•  Experienced driver</p>
<p>•  Tournament fees</p>
<p>•  Hotel and food costs</p>
<p>•  Team t-shirts</p>
<p>•  Washington, D.C. tour
guide </p>
<p>In the event that we are unable to
reach our maximum goal, we will reduce the number of students that we can take
on this trip and limit other spending costs. The  success of the trip
will ultimately be determined by what we are able to raise.  We have
already begun local campaigning in hopes of covering expenses not mentioned.    </p><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<div></div>
<p>We are extremely proud of our
students.  They continue to stay focused on their personal goals by engaging in community projects, service learning,  and other events.  For many, chess has become the model for strategically planning their lives. This annual trip to Washington, D.C. serves as a reward and source of motivation to encourage our students to continue on their positive paths.  </p>

surrounding areas. Our motto, Think Before You Move, encourages
youth to evaluate their circumstances and plan steps to overcome them. CC uses
chess as a therapeutic model and an instrument for encouraging academic
achievement, community engagement, and the utilization of critical thinking
skills.  

Classic City Knights 

The goal of this campaign is to take
the Classic City Knights, CC's resident chess team and mentor group, to
compete in the annual Bum Rush the Board chess tournament in Washington,
D.C. (http://www.wblinc.org/bum-rush-2015/).
This annual trip to Washington, D.C. will be a life-changing, eye opening, and
educational experience for these students. They will get the opportunity to meet
other youth from around the country to share in solutions for
empowerment. Not only will they compete in the chess tournament, but they
will also get an opportunity to tour the Nation’s Capital, Howard University, and North
Carolina A&T University. 
On November 13-16, 2015, we will take
12 middle and high school students from Athens, Georgia, to Washington, D.C.
for an annual chess tournament and touring of the Nation’s Capital.  The
students will be chaperoned by three adolescent development mentors. We are
seeking $5,000 to contribute to the following:
•  Round-trip transportation
rental for students and chaperones  
•  Fuel costs (approximately
1,250 miles) and insurance
•  Experienced driver
•  Tournament fees
•  Hotel and food costs
•  Team t-shirts
•  Washington, D.C. tour
guide 
In the event that we are unable to
reach our maximum goal, we will reduce the number of students that we can take
on this trip and limit other spending costs. The  success of the trip
will ultimately be determined by what we are able to raise.  We have
already begun local campaigning in hopes of covering expenses not mentioned.    
The Impact

We are extremely proud of our
students.  They continue to stay focused on their personal goals by engaging in community projects, service learning,  and other events.  For many, chess has become the model for strategically planning their lives. This annual trip to Washington, D.C. serves as a reward and source of motivation to encourage our students to continue on their positive paths.

</div>We want to help you be <strong>""Rooted in Strength""</strong>! But we need <strong>your</strong> help, too!<div>
<br/><div>You might be asking yourself, ""Why the video?"" The answer is simple. Dutch would never want you to get caught pushing too many pencils, and he knows that there is only going to be one spot in Tacoma that can withstand such a mighty blast and ensure that your health doesn't fall victim to Dillon's suit and tie job: <b>Town Athletics</b>. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>As the title of this page indicates, we will be a <b>Community Rooted in Strength</b>.  The meaning is described in detail below, and we hope that you take the time to read it. But before we get to that, we want to make sure you understand why we are running this campaign. In short, it is because we are a brand new, locally-owned small business that wants to provide you, our future members, a top of the line fitness experience. Securing the financing we need to meet this goal has been challenging, but we did it, and we invested blood, sweat, tears, and a significant amount of our own capital. However, there are some finishing touches we would love to include, like showers for all of your cleansing needs. We know what <b>Town Athletics</b> can be for this <b>community</b>, and it's a vision that<b> </b>has been years in the making. With every dollar we raise here, we are one step closer to guaranteeing that when we open our doors to the public, we're offering exactly what this<b> community</b> deserves.      </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Why <strong>""Rooted in Strength""</strong>?<br/><br/>We have been told by some that a slogan like <strong>""Rooted in Strength""</strong> may be intimidating to new members or members who have never experienced Weightlifting, functional fitness, or a group exercise environment - that it may come off as, ""if you are not already strong, then you need not apply."" This could not be farther from the truth, however, because this line of thinking assumes that ""Strength"" in this instance means how much weight you can move. For us at Town, though, it means much more than that. <br/><br/>It means being rooted in the <b>strength of our communities</b>. <br/><br/>First and foremost, we are rooted in our <b>gym community</b>. When you come to Town, you are joining a family. Our workouts are completed as a group because there are few things more motivating than having other like-minded and supportive individuals surround and encourage you. Group workouts aren't about being the best, or the first one done. Watch any functional fitness competition and you'll see that the person that gets the loudest, most enthusiastic encouragement is usually the person coming in last. That is what is so great about a community workout: It's not about where you place; it’s about motivating you to do the best that you are capable of, and it's on us as coaches to help guide you to your maximum potential. Whether your goal is to lose a few pounds while working out with friends or to perform at a competitive level, we will guide you and our community will support you. This is why one of our expectations at Town is to introduce yourself to other new members. Does this mean you will be best friends with everyone at the gym? Probably not, but it does mean that we are all in this together, and just like a family, we will be dysfunctionally functional. You will love some of us, and others maybe not so much. We can ensure one thing, though: We will foster a supportive environment. <br/><br/>Beyond our gym community, we are also rooted in the strength of our <b>local community</b>. We at Town not only work in Tacoma but live here as well. We support small, locally-owned businesses and collaborate with other locally-owned gyms. While they may be competition, by definition they are not ""the"" competition because we share the same mission. That mission is to help people realize that they can move and feel better than they thought possible, and that their athletic potential didn't end when they left high school. But this can't be done while watching TV and walking on a treadmill; it needs to be a calculated, thoughtful progression. Just as you didn’t start your career without any training, you won't start your path towards fitness, strength, competition, or otherwise without training. Luckily, that is where we come in. <br/><br/>This brings us to our second strength: We are rooted in the <b>strength of our coaching</b>. We at Town treat coaching as a profession. We are all nationally certified in one form of coaching or personal training or another. You might be saying, ""yeah but anyone can take a class and get a certificate,"" and you are correct. However, none of us are content with simply framing a piece of paper. We tirelessly work towards and study to become better coaches and teachers, because in the end, that’s what we’re doing: Teaching. We not only understand how the movements break down, but we also understand how to motivate the end user. It is because of this that we have written into our business plan a yearly, call it mandatory, education stipend. We never want to become content or assume we have all the answers, because I promise you, we don’t - but we will continue to work to that end because we are passionate about it.<br/><br/><b>Passion</b>: This is our third and final strength in which we are rooted. Town is a passion product - one of many months, or rather years, of planning and work. None of us are involved with this to get rich. Don't get me wrong - we still want to run a successful business - but we didn’t put in the work, sweat, and tears because we needed a job. We did it because we love it and we live it. One of the most rewarding things we get to experience is watching a member do something they never thought possible, or to watch a community grow from the simple shared desire to be healthier and perform better. <br/><br/>Are we Rooted in Strength of the muscle variety? Of course, and I think our programming proves this. Without a solid foundation of muscle strength, body awareness and movement are not optimized and all activities beyond the walls of the gym become more difficult. Will you get stronger training with us? Absolutely. Will your level of confidence improve? Definitely. Just remember: You don't have to come in the door with a theoretical level of strength. Just trust in the process and we will get you there. <br/><br/>So again, why ""Rooted in Strength""? Because being rooted in the strength of these building blocks are who we are as a gym, and everyone is invited. <br/><br/>With all of that said, we need <strong>your</strong> help to get our gym started on the right ""root"" and help our entire community become ""Rooted in Strength."" <br/><div>
<br/>Any donation, large or small, is a huge help, and it will all go toward making our gym the best in the community. Thank you in advance, and we'll see you in the gym soon! <strong>Stay Rooted! </strong><p></p>

You might be asking yourself, ""Why the video?"" The answer is simple. Dutch would never want you to get caught pushing too many pencils, and he knows that there is only going to be one spot in Tacoma that can withstand such a mighty blast and ensure that your health doesn't fall victim to Dillon's suit and tie job: Town Athletics. 

As the title of this page indicates, we will be a Community Rooted in Strength.  The meaning is described in detail below, and we hope that you take the time to read it. But before we get to that, we want to make sure you understand why we are running this campaign. In short, it is because we are a brand new, locally-owned small business that wants to provide you, our future members, a top of the line fitness experience. Securing the financing we need to meet this goal has been challenging, but we did it, and we invested blood, sweat, tears, and a significant amount of our own capital. However, there are some finishing touches we would love to include, like showers for all of your cleansing needs. We know what Town Athletics can be for this community, and it's a vision that has been years in the making. With every dollar we raise here, we are one step closer to guaranteeing that when we open our doors to the public, we're offering exactly what this community deserves.      

Why ""Rooted in Strength""?We have been told by some that a slogan like ""Rooted in Strength"" may be intimidating to new members or members who have never experienced Weightlifting, functional fitness, or a group exercise environment - that it may come off as, ""if you are not already strong, then you need not apply."" This could not be farther from the truth, however, because this line of thinking assumes that ""Strength"" in this instance means how much weight you can move. For us at Town, though, it means much more than that. It means being rooted in the strength of our communities. First and foremost, we are rooted in our gym community. When you come to Town, you are joining a family. Our workouts are completed as a group because there are few things more motivating than having other like-minded and supportive individuals surround and encourage you. Group workouts aren't about being the best, or the first one done. Watch any functional fitness competition and you'll see that the person that gets the loudest, most enthusiastic encouragement is usually the person coming in last. That is what is so great about a community workout: It's not about where you place; it’s about motivating you to do the best that you are capable of, and it's on us as coaches to help guide you to your maximum potential. Whether your goal is to lose a few pounds while working out with friends or to perform at a competitive level, we will guide you and our community will support you. This is why one of our expectations at Town is to introduce yourself to other new members. Does this mean you will be best friends with everyone at the gym? Probably not, but it does mean that we are all in this together, and just like a family, we will be dysfunctionally functional. You will love some of us, and others maybe not so much. We can ensure one thing, though: We will foster a supportive environment. Beyond our gym community, we are also rooted in the strength of our local community. We at Town not only work in Tacoma but live here as well. We support small, locally-owned businesses and collaborate with other locally-owned gyms. While they may be competition, by definition they are not ""the"" competition because we share the same mission. That mission is to help people realize that they can move and feel better than they thought possible, and that their athletic potential didn't end when they left high school. But this can't be done while watching TV and walking on a treadmill; it needs to be a calculated, thoughtful progression. Just as you didn’t start your career without any training, you won't start your path towards fitness, strength, competition, or otherwise without training. Luckily, that is where we come in. This brings us to our second strength: We are rooted in the strength of our coaching. We at Town treat coaching as a profession.

<p>I am Marissa Mannella, a recent graduate from Clemson University and current resider in my hometown of Orlando, Florida. Busy as a full-time nanny with my hands and heart full, raising funds to fulfill a calling to serve the Lord in London.  My heart has been heavy yet eager to be present again in Europe since my residing in Milan, Italy a year and a half ago.  Ever since, my mind and heart has continued to ache and desire to be there; to share that there is Hope and Joy in the name of Jesus Christ.  I want to love these people in London as Jesus loves &amp; share His Good News of salvation through Him.  I am filled with excitement to share with you my heart, this ministry, &amp; my calling to go and make disciples.</p>

<p><span style=""font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 26px;"">London is one of the most active and lively cities in the world.  A place where world's top Universities establish their homes, fashion originates leading trends, and over 300 languages and cultures inter-mix, examples of London as the cultural capital of the world, while also stated as the most visited city in the world.</span></p>

<h3><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">The Ministry</span></h3>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">A space set in the bustling city of London, to slow down and rest haste. A place to gather people and build relationships, sharing love and hope from the One who </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">derives</span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> these graces. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 26px;"">Kahaila is an established and active ministry</span> connecting lives in this artistic district on Brick Lane in East London.  This place has a heart and purpose that runs much deeper than serving specialty coffee, it is a space where community and lifestyle meet. Taking form as a gallery for local artists, leading morning yoga classes, performances by local musicians, poets, and storytellers, <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> and a uniting of people to recognize and praise the grandeur and glory of our Heavenly Father.</span></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Gathering together as a church community Wednesday nights, we celebrate and share in the truth of the Good News by which Jesus has bestowed the free gift of salvation through faith in Him.  </span></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Kahaila's space is a mark in this grand city, embodying Matthew 5:14, we take form as ""light of the world, a city set on a hill that cannot be hidden."" </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""><span><br/></span></span></p>

</div></div>","The Who
I am Marissa Mannella, a recent graduate from Clemson University and current resider in my hometown of Orlando, Florida. Busy as a full-time nanny with my hands and heart full, raising funds to fulfill a calling to serve the Lord in London.  My heart has been heavy yet eager to be present again in Europe since my residing in Milan, Italy a year and a half ago.  Ever since, my mind and heart has continued to ache and desire to be there; to share that there is Hope and Joy in the name of Jesus Christ.  I want to love these people in London as Jesus loves & share His Good News of salvation through Him.  I am filled with excitement to share with you my heart, this ministry, & my calling to go and make disciples.
The City
London is one of the most active and lively cities in the world.  A place where world's top Universities establish their homes, fashion originates leading trends, and over 300 languages and cultures inter-mix, examples of London as the cultural capital of the world, while also stated as the most visited city in the world.
Such a place reaps a lost and wandering disconnect.  Impersonal space between people easily seep root, depth and value can be effortlessly overshadowed by materialism and shallow discourse.  Busyness, indeed, may be the easiest distraction to recognizing and acknowledging realism in the hearts of people.
The Ministry
A space set in the bustling city of London, to slow down and rest haste. A place to gather people and build relationships, sharing love and hope from the One who derives these graces. 
Kahaila is an established and active ministry connecting lives in this artistic district on Brick Lane in East London.  This place has a heart and purpose that runs much deeper than serving specialty coffee, it is a space where community and lifestyle meet. Taking form as a gallery for local artists, leading morning yoga classes, performances by local musicians, poets, and storytellers,  and a uniting of people to recognize and praise the grandeur and glory of our Heavenly Father.
Gathering together as a church community Wednesday nights, we celebrate and share in the truth of the Good News by which Jesus has bestowed the free gift of salvation through faith in Him.  
Kahaila's space is a mark in this grand city, embodying Matthew 5:14, we take form as ""light of the world, a city set on a hill that cannot be hidden."" 
And may we be so, a place to identify ourselves in and thus protrude the light of Jesus.








The Result

This is a space that recognizes Jesus as the restorer. With truth and life of scripture, we desire to bring restoration to the city of London. 


For there is much restoration to bring. 


There is a flood of broken and wounded hearts, doubts and insecurities reigning and ruling identities, these lies run free and heavy to swarm and drench the lives of people. We must fight the sweep of lies and hurt with the knowledge of truth, the Word of God. 



May our identity be founded in Beauty opposed to brokenness, Hope opposed to doubt, Eternity opposed to earthly, Salvation opposed to destruction. 


Let us stop identifying ourselves by our insecurities, doubts, hurts, and lies that hang upon our heads and reap shame. Hope has come to lift shame and rather root our identity in confidence, restoration, purity, and truth; in Jesus. 



The Help


I will be serving in Kahaila, making coffee and hosting events for local creatives in the community.  Connecting with the lives & hearts of people, sharing the truth and holiness of our Creator, to bring restoration, depth, and hope.

My heart continues to grow heavy in this season of preparedness before departure to this city.  I cannot sustain the work of God without prayer and support. 
Join me in this movement to bring restoration to people of brokenness.







Financial Support
If you are willing and able to support financially and with a heart of joyful giving, I am thankful and excited for the Lord's work with these resources.  My total goal is raising $30,000 for my one year stay and living in London. 
Efforts will specifically support my living and ability to reside; rent, food, visa, transportation, insurance, and other general living expenses.
Prayer Support
I am grateful and eager for such prayers and already said prayers for the Lord to bless and use in His great power and work.  Prayer, being eternal and from God, is the most essential and transcendent way for the Lord to guide, strengthen, and provide for me.  I believe the Lord will also use these prayers to speak specifically to your hearts on how He wants to use your talents, gifts, and resources to give Him glory and honor.  

Pray for me toward the city and the people: 

""That my love will overflow more & more, and that I will keep on growing in knowledge and understanding."" Philippians 1:9; As I may tire & grow weary serving in the shop, my eyes will continue to be fixated on Him and work as a genuine-joyful act of prayer and worship;  For boldness & confidence in act and speech of the Holy Spirit; & that I may truly take on the whole armor of God, to be prepared for battle against the spiritual forces of evil and fight with the Word of God.

<p>We've lived in Newcastle since we
were students and loved it so much we couldn't leave. We are continually inspired by the different, and brilliant,
ideas people have to escape the daily grind. One such idea that really grabbed
us in Japan, and then London, was the cat café.

</p>
<p><span>We love cats, cafes and cakes, so it
was just a perfect concept. We tried it, loved it and thought that the increasing café visiting population of Newcastle must have one as soon as
possible.

<p><span>We set to work on naming it, which a
friend did for us. We laughed a lot, and then thought we really must call it
Pretty Pussy Parlour.

</span></p>
<p><span>Pretty Pussy Parlour is a cat
and café experience for busy people that don’t have pets or cat lovers that
want more! The Parlour will be a relaxed, comfortable environment for people
of all ages to interact with friendly and healthy cats. </span></p>
<p>How will it work? Customers will book
1 hour sessions in advance via our website to interact with our family
of 12 cats. We’ll serve a great selection of top quality hot drinks (including
soup), sandwiches and yummy cakes.</p>
<p>We also plan to have a gift shop in-house and on-line, stocking amazing and exclusive cat related products that we’ve discovered.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span></p>

<p><span>Hi there, Wes and I are the founders of Farmetta Farm. Etta, in Greek, means small, and that's what we are: a small pasture based livestock farm in mid-coast Maine. We lease, rent, and own a full 80 acres of fields and pastures that we graze our critters on, all within a 2 ½ mile radius of our home. Wes and I (I'm Rose) begun farming together in the spring of ‘09 with a vision of beef, chicken, pork, lamb and eggs from healthy, grass-fed and pasture-raised animals.”</span></p>
<br/><p>Through the time Wes and I have been farming, we've evolved from “my farm” to “our farm.” What I'm saying is that we realized we needn't take on a large mortgage in order to build our farm; we could build our farm through cooperation with our neighbors. We had great opportunities in our back yard; we just needed to ask the neighbors, can we graze our animals on your fields? Some said no; others were thrilled - that's how we began our relationship with Reid Woodbury. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1257249/files/20150228174329-DSC01159.JPG?1425174209"" src="""" style=""width: 492.275784753363px; height: 369px;""/></p>
<br/><p>Reid retired from dairy farming in the fall of 2013. Reid didn't want to see his fields, old stanchion barn, milk room, and equipment, become overgrown or to rust with disuse, and that's where we come in.  We'd been searching for a place to either buy or lease, with a barn and other needed infrastructure; now we've got it! Wes and I signed a long-term lease with Reid with the option to buy.</p>
<br/><p>When Wes, Reid and I started discussions on collaborating, the two primary pieces for Wes and myself are first, a barn for animals, feed, and other needs; and second and equally important, a space in which to build a commercial kitchen for me. </p>
<br/><p>Wes and I are here at this perfect junction, looking for financial partners like you to help us move up to the next level of growth.  We are ready. We've built a great customer base, taken business classes to strengthen our business savvy, and signed our lease with Reid. We researched the market (which, by the way, is ripe for the picking!).  We are ready for this next level of growth, and, with a little help from folks like you, we can do it!  </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1258459/files/20150301083045-DSC01379.JPG?1425227445"" src="""" style=""width: 500px; height: 375px;""/></p><br/><p>Let me tell you about the commercial kitchen, so near and dear to my heart. Finally, I can create new product lines to sell to our customers. I’ve wanted a kitchen for as long as Wes and I have been farming together…in all honesty, I can taste it! This not only will enable us to create value with the meats and bones that don’t sell; it also allows us a steady income stream during the colder months, helping to strengthen our financial backbone. We’ll be able to create jobs as our markets grow, helping our community and strengthening our local economy. </p>
<br/><p>Our budget for the kitchen is as follows:</p>
<p><b>Kitchen construction/retrofit -  8, 000.</b></p>
<p><b>Tilt Skillet and 6 burner stove – 4,700.</b></p>
<p><b>Heat pump – 2,700.</b></p>
<p><b>Refrigeration - 2,500.</b></p>
<p><b>Sinks: three bay, prep and hand washing - 1,270.</b></p>
<p><b>Kitchen utensils, pots and pans - 445.</b></p>
<p><b>Lids, containers and labels – 385.</b></p>
<br/><p>As Forrest Pritchard so aptly said in his book <i>Gaining Ground</i>, “The family farm will continue as long as its existence is valued. There is strength in a family, and balance. The earth appears to respond to these things. And who is to say what defines a family? Certainly not me. My best attempt at a definition would be to suggest a congregation of like-minded hearts.</p>
<br/><p>Saving the family farm will forever be a process, not a goal or destination. Like any necessary chore, the work never ends. It only waits for us the following morning, or the following season. So I wake and enter the day. “</p>
<br/><p>I hope that you share in our vision to bring this opportunity to fruition as we continue to work on our 21st century family farm. You can be a part of the change by helping Farmetta Farm achieve our goal.</p>

<h3>Breaking down the barriers to accessing Technology </h3>
<p>Technology is central to everything in our modern lives yet the majority of the world's population live in poverty without basic access to clean drinking water, food, health care or education. We believe that technology can improve people's lives and give them limitless opportunities to help them achieve their personal aspirations. Yet access to basic technology is a challenge in developing countries and to vulnerable people in developed countries. <br/></p>

<h2>Who we are</h2>
<p>We are a team of social entrepreneurs, technology developers, scientists and educators who have come together through our work with deprived communities and vulnerable groups. We have seen first hand the difference technology makes to people's lives, in how simple basic tools and knowledge can guide disaster relief efforts and rebuild communities in war torn regions.  Quite simply, technology can innovatively solve a range of challenges we face in today's turbulent society.</p>
<h2><br/></h2>
<h2>The Problem<br/>
</h2>
<div>Deprived communities exist in both developed and developing nations. In developing nations more than a billion people still do not have access to electricity, and cannot access a reliable source of energy. The conflict of war and an increase in extreme weather through climate change has forced millions to loose their homes and seek refuge with no financial security. A global crisis in modern times, we are faced as a society with complex issues which need to be urgently addressed. </div>

<h2>The Solution</h2>
<p></p>
<p>BEACON will act as the catalyst of change in the way that we approach technology in breaking down the barriers to technology access and helping communities and vulnerable groups break the cycle of deprivation. We will create a global network of supporters who will focus their efforts in using technology and innovation to address society's greatest challenges, and provide universal access to technology for those in deprived communities. By developing technology kits, tools, apps and educational resources and distributing these to communities who need sources of energy, food and health services, we will provide solutions to the every day challenges that people in the developing world face. It will be through this mass collaborative effort that we will bring about change and eradicate poverty.</p>

<h2>How its going to work:</h2>
<div>We will break down the barriers to accessing technology for development. When we speak of technology it needn't be expensive or complex, the simplest of tools can be powerfully effective. For example, the Zeer pot is an earthenware cooling system which can preserve food for up to two weeks and is revolutionising lives in desert regions. It has since been adopted by communities in Africa as a way to keep food fresh and has improved the lives of thousands of people. And all through a simple technique using traditional pre-existing tools, gadgets, and kits that can be used in the most arid, extreme conditions. We have picked out a number of innovative technologies that will improve people's lives on a number of levels. Each technology is low cost, low maintenance and easy to use by everyone from the youngest of children to the adults.</div>

A Zeer pot is an evaporative cooled used in rural Africa and the Middle East to keep vegetables, meat and cereals fresh. They consist of two terra cotta pots, one nested inside the other, with sand placed inbetween the gap between the the pots. The trick is to keep the sand damp and to pour water onto the sand twice a day to keep the pots cool. Through water evaporating from the sand the temperature inside the pot is kept at a lower temperature, keeping the food fresher for longer. This simple technique allows communities to use materials which are natural to their traditions and can really help their daily lives. </span></div>

</div></div>","Breaking down the barriers to accessing Technology

 Technology is a great enabler. It puts the power in the hands of people who need it the most, changing their lives for the better. That's why we are embarking on the largest global Citizen Science initiative to eradicate poverty.

Beacon is undertaking an audacious mission to transform the lives of people in deprived communities and those who are most vulnerable in society. We aim to empower each person we reach through BEACON with the skills and capabilities to solve the personal challenges they face, whether it be a mother in Sudan struggling to feed her family or a young person who is homeless who faces an uncertain future and needs the support to help them find employment. We aim to do this through supplying technology based kits, gadgets and educational resources to supply sources of electricity, energy, food and health services to deprived communities around the world who need it the most.
Every child and adult has the basic human right to have access to technology that can provide them with food security, energy security, a comfortable home, fresh clean drinking water and sanitation. The BEACON project aims to change the status quo and make a valuable impact to improve the lives of millions of people around the world through simple, innovative technologies. And we need your help to do this!

2.5 Billion people live without sanitation and safe 
drinking water

In the 21st century, half of the world's population lives in poverty, 1 billion of which are children. Families are forced to send their children out to work and vulnerable people are shipped into slave labour. Hunger is the number 1 cause of death in the world, killing more than HIV/AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis combined. These shocking statistics represent a failure to provide modern day solutions to common problems which can be solved quite simply though technology and innovation.

Breaking down the barriers to accessing Technology 
Technology is central to everything in our modern lives yet the majority of the world's population live in poverty without basic access to clean drinking water, food, health care or education. We believe that technology can improve people's lives and give them limitless opportunities to help them achieve their personal aspirations. Yet access to basic technology is a challenge in developing countries and to vulnerable people in developed countries. 



Who we are
We are a team of social entrepreneurs, technology developers, scientists and educators who have come together through our work with deprived communities and vulnerable groups. We have seen first hand the difference technology makes to people's lives, in how simple basic tools and knowledge can guide disaster relief efforts and rebuild communities in war torn regions.  Quite simply, technology can innovatively solve a range of challenges we face in today's turbulent society.

The Problem

Deprived communities exist in both developed and developing nations. In developing nations more than a billion people still do not have access to electricity, and cannot access a reliable source of energy. The conflict of war and an increase in extreme weather through climate change has forced millions to loose their homes and seek refuge with no financial security. A global crisis in modern times, we are faced as a society with complex issues which need to be urgently addressed. 


The Solution

BEACON will act as the catalyst of change in the way that we approach technology in breaking down the barriers to technology access and helping communities and vulnerable groups break the cycle of deprivation. We will create a global network of supporters who will focus their efforts in using technology and innovation to address society's greatest challenges, and provide universal access to technology for those in deprived communities. By developing technology kits, tools, apps and educational resources and distributing these to communities who need sources of energy, food and health services, we will provide solutions to the every day challenges that people in the developing world face. It will be through this mass collaborative effort that we will bring about change and eradicate poverty.

The Multiplier Effect - Seeds of Change
We work directly with communities and vulnerable individuals to help them change their lives. We plant the seeds of change by empowering communities and individuals with the tools to be able to change their lives for the better.




We aim to follow a four pillar approach to tackling the problem:  
Pillar 1: Create an army of supporters who share our vision and will act as ""Beacons of Change"" to shine light on social issues to help us achieve our goals. Through undertaking a variety of challenges, supporters will acts as Citizen Social Scientists, bringing together a variety of personal skills and ideas that will change to world and bring solutions.
Pillar 2: Develop simple technological tools, Apps, and existing technology to distribute kits, resources, items and educational materials to communities and vulnerable individuals to help them alleviate deprivation and poverty. Education is at the heart of everything we do, after all, learning is a life long journey! By empowering citizens with technical capabilities they can use their knowledge to overcome their personal and community challenges. 
Pillar 3: Build a community of trainers and community spaces who can provide support in each of their regions. Every person trained will be embodied with the capabilities and skills to train others in their communities and pass on the knowledge they have. Creating a multiplier effect, hundreds of thousands of people will be trained year on year to be able to help their communities fight depravation and receive the support through our mentorship and ambassador programme to do so, along with the support of the larger BEACON community. Through developing a global network of community hubs in makerspaces, science centres, museums, art galleries, libraries and community spaces, citizens regardless of age will be able to pick up new skills, learn practically anything, and use their new found capabilities to improve their lives.
Pillar 4: Mentor and Ambassador programme
Develop a Mentor and Ambassador programme where supporters volunteer their time to support the BEACON programme and pair up with individuals and communities to help them solve their problems and gain the necessary means to improve their lives. 





How its going to work:
We will break down the barriers to accessing technology for development. When we speak of technology it needn't be expensive or complex, the simplest of tools can be powerfully effective. For example, the Zeer pot is an earthenware cooling system which can preserve food for up to two weeks and is revolutionising lives in desert regions. It has since been adopted by communities in Africa as a way to keep food fresh and has improved the lives of thousands of people. And all through a simple technique using traditional pre-existing tools, gadgets, and kits that can be used in the most arid, extreme conditions. We have picked out a number of innovative technologies that will improve people's lives on a number of levels. Each technology is low cost, low maintenance and easy to use by everyone from the youngest of children to the adults.
Providing education and training to communities to engage people of all ages is the key to empowering citizens with skills and the capabilities they need to benefit their everyday lives. 






Classroom in a Box
We have developed a series of education resources to create ""Classroom in a box"" to provide educators and learners with hands-on practical learning activities. Each box contains learning materials translated into the regional language by our extensive network of BEACON supporters. The learning resources have been developed by groups of teachers for educators and have been tried and tested by students all over the world. Using a STEAM approach (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, Mathematics), learners gain technical skills and knowledge through a range of practical, hands-on activities. The learning materials take a problem solving, inquiry based learning approach. Subject topics include:


Science

Technology

Engineering

Mathematics

Reading, Writing and Language skills

Coding

Robotics

Creativity 

Traditional arts, crafts and design indigenous to the community's region





Through our existing network we will distribute educational resources to schools to provide them with books, learning materials and fun activities. Where schools don't exist and children are working to support their families we will work with partner organisations to develop education programmes to found schools in those regions so that children have the chance to receive an education.

The education programme helps individuals develop vital knowledge and skills, work as a team, gain self-esteem and confidence. A dedicated web portal is being  developed to provide a database of lesson plans, projects, tools, DIY Kits, and technology curricula. Educators and students can mix and match activities from different subject topics to suit their needs.








Makerspaces as Community Learning and Training Hubs


In 2014, together with a number of partner organisations, the BEACON team established the Destination Discovery Network, a global consortium of Makerspaces, Museums, Science Centres, Educators, technologists and developers. Our core aim is to make science and technology accessible to all and we see this as a vital step in opening up access to education and training.  By establishing Makerspaces in community used spaces, communities can learn, gain new skills, develop their own businesses and use tools which were previously inaccessible to them. By bringing community members together to work collaboratively with support from organisations, we will create a technology literate society, empowering citizens to overcome their personal challenges.


Mentor and Ambassador Programme
We invite our supporters to join our Mentor and Ambassador programme, who act as our vanguard for engaging with communities. Our mentors and ambassadors come from a wide range of backgrounds and sectors bringing their own unique expertise and insight. By providing mentoring and positive experiences for vulnerable people the mentors guide individuals on their path to reach their aspirations. BEACON Ambassadors are often individuals who have received support from the programme and want to join to give something back and support the work being done in their region. They understand their regions problems and provide a much needed voice in local matters, where working with local authorities and communities. Support is given to mentors and ambassadors through our training programme, where participants have the opportunity to expand on their skills.



We seek to create a global movement to use technology for the benefit of all. It sounds like a ginormous task but its audaciousness lies in its simplicity!

Of course we can not do this alone and we are building partnerships with like minded organisations to support the continued efforts of fighting poverty and social deprivation. 
Kits, Gadgets and Technological Tools
Our team have handpicked a number of existing technological gadgets, tools and resources that are gamechangers in bringing food, energy and health security to millions of people around the world. Here is our favourite top five,our kits and resources are growing all the time and the list of kits and resources is available here.

Perhaps there is something that we haven't thought of yet that you can contribute to and hit us with your amazing idea or solution? Our strength lies in our vibrant community and the ideas and innovations they bring. We like to think outside the box and hit a challenge from every angle so every idea helps!

1. Little Sun Light
This pretty little solar lantern looks dainty but can supply light for up to 5 hours once charged. It works by using solar cells to power a light source and can be worn as a pendant, fixed to a bike or used as a night time reading light source. It has been a hit in both developed and developing nations and is helping micro businesses reach new customers through its sale as a product that not only looks great, but is sturdy and powerful.





2. Zeer Pot Fridge
In hot climates, food doesn't stay fresh for long, with no means of preserving food, poverty stricken families battle hunger on a daily basis. A Zeer pot is an evaporative cooled used in rural Africa and the Middle East to keep vegetables, meat and cereals fresh. They consist of two terra cotta pots, one nested inside the other, with sand placed inbetween the gap between the the pots. The trick is to keep the sand damp and to pour water onto the sand twice a day to keep the pots cool. Through water evaporating from the sand the temperature inside the pot is kept at a lower temperature, keeping the food fresher for longer. This simple technique allows communities to use materials which are natural to their traditions and can really help their daily lives. 


3. Ceramic Water Filters


Ceramic filters are flowerpot shaped and made from a porous ceramic material. Water is poured into a ceramic pot filter and percolate through the pot material where it is collected by a second container. A colloidal silver coating is added to the ceramic filter to add to the effectiveness of the filter.  The ceramic filter removes the harmful bacteria and parasites, and can be manufactured locally, making it sustainable and minimal resources required.



4. Bottle of Light

What do you get with sunshine and an old plastic bottle filled with water and chlorine? A 55-watt solar bulb that refracts sunlight! Its powerful enough to light up a home during daylight hours, environmentally friendly and inexpensive to make. The Liter of Light began in the Philippines where the movement has brightened up 28,000 homes and  the lives of 70,000 people in Manila alone. Now we plan to spread the work of this amazing initiative and take it to areas where the cost of running light during the daytime can be reduced.  With the addition of solar panels the bulb can be used at night time also.





5. Rainwater Harvesting Kits


Rainwater catchment and storage reservoirs have been constructed since ancient times in several parts of the world. Rainwater is harvested as it runs over natural ground, roofs and catchment areas. In tropical islands rain water is the only source of domestic water. As clean water becomes scarce, ad in times where extreme weather hits towns and causes flooding, water supplies become infected and a source of clean water is needed immediately. We will be distributing Rainwater Harvesting Kits to areas devastated by flooding and drought hit regions.


What we plan to do with the money raised here
We will focus on using the funding raised in our campaign to fund our three main areas of work:
Education
Develop technology kits and printed teaching materials to be distributed to schools worldwide who lack teaching resources. Up till now we have relied on donated books and resources yet we need a way to get those resources sent out to individual groups. Every £20 raised supports a family to keep their child in education and receive a meal each day.




Build a community of trainers 

Our network spans across 70 countries around the world, and our community is expanding by the day. To support the training of 1000 Teachers, Educators, and Ambassadors will cost £75,000 at £150 per training session. Our trained ambassadors and teachers will then go onto train others in their regions, thus impacting thousands more people in the process.



Create a global hub of Makerspaces for Learning and Training




We will partner with a range of organisations to establish a global hub of makerspaces for community learning and training. Each community will have ownership of their makerspace which will be open to all members of the community regardless of age and gender. 


Develop Technology Kits and resources to distribute to communities around the World 

We plan to send technology kits, and much needed resources out to communities  around the world. Our team of ambassadors and supporters will focus on supporting their local communities in implementing the technology and building the infrastructure to last for generations to come. £225,000 will be used to build the technology kits, source low cost materials from suppliers and distribute the kits and resources. 




Ways you can Help
Choose a Challenge, join a team, and implement the 
solution in your region.
By opening up a set of Challenges to be met and inviting you to propose your ideas and concepts of providing solutions, we will create some amazing and end global poverty as a society!
We will add ideas for Challenges to be met here on the campaign page so that everyone can contribute to the global conversation.

<br/><h3>Our Story</h3>
<p><b>Downtown Richmond is coming alive!</b>  Home to the historic Winters Building and the East Bay Center for Performing Arts, Kaiser Hospital, BART, and the Metro Walk Transit Village, Downtown Richmond is bouncing back—returning to its roots as a thriving commercial district that was home to a diverse mix of businesses including movie theaters, department stores, small mom-and-pop shops, and restaurants. </p>
<p><b>Richmond Main Street is proud to be working in partnership with Home of Chicken and Waffles to bring a family-style sit down restaurant to the new BART parking garage on Macdonald Avenue.</b>  In addition to Chicken and Waffles, we also have the opportunity to support the build out of the entire 10,000 square feet of raw retail space with a café and coffee shop. </p>

<h3>Challenges &amp; Vision</h3>
<p>For far too long Downtown Richmond has had little to no investment to support the   development projects that are vital to the economic development of the city.

<p>No more is it okay for residents of central Richmond to travel miles outside the core of their city for a good, wholesome meal.  No more is it okay to deny residents the services they need and force them to spend their dollars in neighboring cities. </p>

<p>Street Cruise, our outreach service, which is spoken highly of by young people, police, businesses and the community generally, has been reduced to only a Friday night service.

<p>Our philosophy is simple: Everything you eat should be really, really delicious. If it's not, why bother? We make our products with care, using only the best stuff, and we never, ever use anything we can’t pronounce because we’re obsessed with making everything we touch just right. In fact, we’re sort of obsessed with you…with your happiness, your well-being and, mostly, your dinner. </p>
<p>We've been plugging along for about 2 years (that's about 3,000 jars!), with only 2 unpaid ""employees"" undertaking a truly archaic process of sanitizing, filling and selling our distinctive jars and the response has been amazing! So amazing, in fact, that we can no longer fill the demand for our delicious products with our own two hands! We need to grow, and we need your help! If we can't make the transition from handmade products to responsibly (and locally!) manufactured micro-batch products, this is the end of the road for HMK. A world without Bourbon Bath? Without Steak Candy?! We know! Too awful to contemplate! But, contemplate it we must...</p> </div> <div> <h3>Help us bring the Messes to the Masses!</h3> <p>If we are ever to become a real business with real distribution and real profits, we must change and grow. But how? After much consideration, it is clear that taking on our own kitchen lease and attempting to expand our handmade production is not a practical or realistic way forward. Instead, we are feeling very fortunate to have hooked up with manufacturing partners here in the Baltimore area who can assist us in ramping up our production (waaaay up!) without sacrificing the outrageous flavors and quality our customers have become accustomed to OR our commitment to locally produced, all-natural, wholesome products you can feel good about feeding your family, friends &amp; selves. </p>
<p>We will be working with Mama Vida, Inc. in Randallstown, MD to produce our Bourbon Bath BBQ Sauce and Punch Drunk Ketchup and, eventually, to expand our product line (Who wants HMK Mustard? HMK Bloody Mary's?? You do, that's who!). Mama Vida is a family-owned business with the capabilities to take our sauce production from 6 cases at a time to 150 gorgeous, all-natural cases at a time. Wow!  Our initial batches will cost us just about $11,000. </p>
<p>Our Dry Rub products and our chili seasoning mix will be getting the royal treatment  over at Vann's Spice in Woodlawn, MD. Vann's has an international reputation for excellence and has the capabilities to transition our dry product production from 50 lbs. per batch to up to 500 lbs. per batch. For our initial production runs with Vann's, we are hoping to make 250 lbs. of each of our 4 dry seasoning blends. Not only can Vann's make our products bigger; they can make them better! With access to spice, herb, salt &amp; sugar varietals we've never been able to get our hands on, Vann's is bringing our flavor game way, way up! We know! We didn't think our rubs could get better either, but wow! Wait until you taste this stuff! Our initial batches will cost us $10,000. </p>
<p>The remaining $9,000 we hope to raise will allow us to warehouse our new quantities and market them to the grocery stores and distributors that will help us to get them into your hands, as well as paying for the alterations and expansions of our insurance and licenses. </p>
<p></p>
<h3>So, HMK, what makes you think you can move that much product?? </h3>
<p>We've got promise and heart and a whole lot of spunk, that's what! More specifically, we have - and have had for some time now - regional vendor approval from Whole Foods Market and interest from an array of larger retailers that value local, all-natural products. What we do not have is the capabilities to guarantee our supply chain to those retailers no matter how fast our products might fly off of their shelves. We need to make this transition to become the solid, reliable business we must be in order to undertake bigger relationships. </p>
<p>But isn't there still a risk in making this much product while still lining up vendor relationships? Don't think we haven't thought of that! All HMK products offer outstanding shelf-life, even without preservatives (sort of makes you wonder why people eat preservatives, doesn't it. I digress...), so even if sales don't immediately skyrocket, we have a very comfortable 2 years to sell these products. We're pretty confident about the skyrocket-ing, though. So much potential. </p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 30px;"">This is where you come in, hungry friends! </span><br/></p>
</div><div> <p>We are excited and thrilled that our friends, family, customers, retailers and yes, you, might entertain the idea of making a contribution towards transitioning HMK's manufacturing process. If you're familiar with our products, you know that HMK's unique flavor profiles, all-natural ethos and commitment to quality and the health &amp; well-being of our customers are worth supporting. As we all focus more on the quality and genesis of the foods we consume, HMK products allow diners everywhere to indulge in deep, exciting flavors without consuming chemicals, additives, flavor enhancers or any other such nonsense. You don't need it! Your body doesn't want it! Flavor does not have to be bad for you! Don't you dare let us catch you dumping MSG on your grass fed beef, y'all. We will smack that jar of additives right out of your hand! </p>
<p>So, check out the array of perks that we've put forth to entice you further. From products for your own home use, to enough jars to share, to a HMK Party of your own, all the way up to helping us name &amp; build the personality of an upcoming product, no matter what you can contribute, we hope to make it worth your while. There is no contribution too small so, while we have set perk levels in a manner that allow us to share with you while covering our costs, we hope, as this campaign goes forward, to acknowledge each and every one of our contributors with an HMK gift. Don't hesitate to reach out with questions or requests! </p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>
<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">What if this campaign isn't fully funded?</span><br/>
</h3>
<div>As if! Still, every plan needs a Plan B. Because HMK currently offers 6 products, if we have some success with our campaign but don't meet our $30,000 goal, we can prioritize the production of products with our partners (say that 3x fast!) to address production one, two, three or four products at a time. While it is our dream to go for it and transition our entire product line at once, we can still make the transition more slowly, starting with our best-sellers and moving forward from there if this campaign is not fully funded within 37 days, although that would mean that only those products we could transition would be available. We will not continue to make some products by hand while others are manufactured for us. That, friends, would be certifiably insane.</div>
<div>If this campaign does not earn at least the majority of the necessary funding, this is quite likely the end of the road for HMK and your contributions will be returned to you. We cannot continue to make the products at zero profit. Production requires a huge time commitment which, if you recall from high school econ, results in an opportunity cost, as all of our time invested in HMK is time away from other endeavors, both personal and professional. So far, this has been a weird experiment in community service, making BBQ sauce and more just to see the smile on your faces. That's been fun and rewarding, but it is not a business. </div>
<div>Why crowd funding? Why not take a loan? In short, risk. HMK is currently one person. Kristin is her name and Kristin has a young family. HMK is also currently only worth its inventory at any given moment because we do not own a facility, equipment or other collateral against which we might borrow to finance our growth. If you're the type of investor who might be interested in partnering with HMK and seeing an eventual return on your investment beyond our fun array of perks, we need you to help us get past this first transition first. As HMK grows, there may be potential for more traditional investment. </div> <p><span style=""font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 30px;"">No money? Us either! You can still help! Here's how:</span><br/></p>
</div><div> <p>We are completely in touch with the idea that many of our customers care and want to help but may not be able to open their wallets to do so. We would still appreciate your vote of confidence and support in the form of spreading the word and sharing this campaign with your friends and family. It's easy! Just hit SHARE! Also, do continue to patronize our current Baltimore retailers. The more HMK you buy, the more they will order from us and that works out nicely. </p>
<p>Thank you for supporting us and loving on small businesses. Look around our great nation and see where moving away from small business towards huge, behemoth retailers has landed us. It's ugly out in Wal-Mart world, kids. Sometimes, a better future actually means taking a step back and returning to the values that mattered a few generations ago. Support the businesses that speak to your core values and watch your community flourish! We hope we're one of those businesses! We promise, we won't let you down! Whatever the form of your support, we're grateful for it. We're grateful for you! THANK YOU!</p>

We have purchased a beautiful piece of farmland (""finca"") in Spain, that we're now turning into a self-supporting permaculture farm (growing our own food, raising animals) while building our off-grid home and rural retreat on it. </p>
<p>To help us achieve our goal faster, we're now offering several possibilities to invest in our project - by already booking your stay or by buying some of our products. </p>
<p></p>
<h3>What's the plan? </h3>
<div>We divided the whole project in several parts: <br/>
</div>
<div><ul>
<li>Phase 1 - Rebuilding the maset (""Mas de Vaquer""), so we can go and live in it for the time being. Later on, it will be available for holiday renting. Start: December 2014. Eind: June 2015. <br/>
</li>
<li>Phase 2 - Building the masia (""Mas del Encanto""). This is the big house, which will have 3 guest rooms for our bed &amp; breakfast. Start: March 2015. End: May 2016. </li>
<li>Phase 3 - Establishing a permaculture farm, so we can produce our own food (and that of our guests). We're planting (fruit) trees and plants, acquiring animals (chickens, sheep, pigs, goats, rabbits and others) and tending to our herb &amp; vegetable garden. Start: October 2014. Probably not ending soon! </li>
<li>Phase 3 - Groundworks, ponds and swimming pool. Start: September 2015. End: depending on funding (hopefully November 2015)</li>
<li>Phase 4 - ""Meeting &amp; Meditation"" building, with bar and outside kitchen. Planned for 2017.</li>
<li>Phase 5 - 2 more guest houses. Little casita's on their own private terrace, available for holiday renting or as accommodation for participants to our retreats.  </li>
</ul></div>
<p>Our current budget will only take us so far; we have anticipated the building of the house but lack the funds for proper finishing. And this is where you come in (we hope). <span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">Without your help, we can move into our home in May 2016 and start saving for the rest of it; but your help would make it possible to welcome our first guests by the summer of 2016. </span></p> </div><div>

The dining area will have a kitchenette, so you can prepare your own meal if you don't feel like waiting for Spanish lunch / dinner time.  </span></li>
<li><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Earthworks to set up a working natural irrigation system: € 3500,- <br/>This will include a few ponds (for water harvesting) and a swimming pond, and several canals and swales. </span></li>
<li>If we reach our goal, we estimate about € 1300,- will go to Indiegogo fees. The more you contribute, the smaller the percentage we lose to those fees! </li> </ul>
<div>The total funding we are going for with this campaign is € 19300,- . If we don't reach our goal, we'll concentrate our efforts into finishing the guestrooms, so you, your friends and your family can at least come and enjoy your vacation. </div>
<div>The most important thing about this campaign (for you), is that you get the chance to get products from Mas del Encanto at a discount price.

After doing the rat race thing for 15+ years, we are very happy to be here in Spain and living a totally different life; just as busy, but way more relaxed and closer to nature. We would love to become fully self-sufficient, and to share this with others. </p>
<p>We believe Mas del Encanto can be a haven for our guests as well. Maybe you've always wanted to write a novel and would like to come stay with us for a while to finish it? Of maybe you see your children grow up in the city and would like them to learn where their food comes from, build camps in the woods and have a vacation where they forget about their tablets and smartphones? Or maybe you'd just like to get away from the world for a few days... Then our rural retreat might be the right place for you. </p>
<p>We are situated between the villages of Lledo (pronounciation: ""Yeh-dóh"") and Cretas, in Aragon near the border with Catalunya. The region here is called Matarranya, and is known for its vineyards, olive and almond groves, beautiful biking and hiking trails, old villages and castles, and (last but not least) the mountains of ""Els Ports"" national park, with its ibex, vultures and other wildlife.</p>
<p>To us, this is one of the most beautiful places in the world - we hope you can come and join us, and share a part of our new life. </p>

</div></div>","About Mas del Encanto We are Axel (from the Netherlands) and Sandrine (from Belgium), and we'd love you to help us build our dream. We have purchased a beautiful piece of farmland (""finca"") in Spain, that we're now turning into a self-supporting permaculture farm (growing our own food, raising animals) while building our off-grid home and rural retreat on it. 
To help us achieve our goal faster, we're now offering several possibilities to invest in our project - by already booking your stay or by buying some of our products. 

What's the plan? 
We divided the whole project in several parts: 


Phase 1 - Rebuilding the maset (""Mas de Vaquer""), so we can go and live in it for the time being. Later on, it will be available for holiday renting. Start: December 2014. Eind: June 2015. 

Phase 2 - Building the masia (""Mas del Encanto""). This is the big house, which will have 3 guest rooms for our bed & breakfast. Start: March 2015. End: May 2016. 
Phase 3 - Establishing a permaculture farm, so we can produce our own food (and that of our guests). We're planting (fruit) trees and plants, acquiring animals (chickens, sheep, pigs, goats, rabbits and others) and tending to our herb & vegetable garden. Start: October 2014. Probably not ending soon! 
Phase 3 - Groundworks, ponds and swimming pool. Start: September 2015. End: depending on funding (hopefully November 2015)
Phase 4 - ""Meeting & Meditation"" building, with bar and outside kitchen. Planned for 2017.
Phase 5 - 2 more guest houses. Little casita's on their own private terrace, available for holiday renting or as accommodation for participants to our retreats.  

Our current budget will only take us so far; we have anticipated the building of the house but lack the funds for proper finishing. And this is where you come in (we hope). Without your help, we can move into our home in May 2016 and start saving for the rest of it; but your help would make it possible to welcome our first guests by the summer of 2016.  


  What we need - and what you get

We need funding for these projects:
  Finishing & furniture for the guest rooms and communal rooms: € 14.500,- The guest rooms will each have 2 single / 1 double bed, a small fridge, plenty of closet space for your stuff, a desk and 2 chairs; and of course a bathroom with shower, toilet and washing basin. The dining area will have a kitchenette, so you can prepare your own meal if you don't feel like waiting for Spanish lunch / dinner time.  
Earthworks to set up a working natural irrigation system: € 3500,- This will include a few ponds (for water harvesting) and a swimming pond, and several canals and swales. 
If we reach our goal, we estimate about € 1300,- will go to Indiegogo fees. The more you contribute, the smaller the percentage we lose to those fees!  
The total funding we are going for with this campaign is € 19300,- . If we don't reach our goal, we'll concentrate our efforts into finishing the guestrooms, so you, your friends and your family can at least come and enjoy your vacation. 
The most important thing about this campaign (for you), is that you get the chance to get products from Mas del Encanto at a discount price. So-called ""perks"" (= what you get for investing in our project) include products from our land, vacations at Mas del Encanto and meals prepared with local produce (if possible even from our own land). 






What's so special about Mas del Encanto?
 Mas del Encanto is very special to us. After doing the rat race thing for 15+ years, we are very happy to be here in Spain and living a totally different life; just as busy, but way more relaxed and closer to nature. We would love to become fully self-sufficient, and to share this with others. 
We believe Mas del Encanto can be a haven for our guests as well. Maybe you've always wanted to write a novel and would like to come stay with us for a while to finish it? Of maybe you see your children grow up in the city and would like them to learn where their food comes from, build camps in the woods and have a vacation where they forget about their tablets and smartphones? Or maybe you'd just like to get away from the world for a few days... Then our rural retreat might be the right place for you. 
We are situated between the villages of Lledo (pronounciation: ""Yeh-dóh"") and Cretas, in Aragon near the border with Catalunya. The region here is called Matarranya, and is known for its vineyards, olive and almond groves, beautiful biking and hiking trails, old villages and castles, and (last but not least) the mountains of ""Els Ports"" national park, with its ibex, vultures and other wildlife.
To us, this is one of the most beautiful places in the world - we hope you can come and join us, and share a part of our new life. 

   What could go wrong? As we've both mainly lived in cities, off-grid living in the Spanish mountains has a lot of surprises in store for us! You can read a bit about this on our blog (click here). 
Thankfully, we both have a can-do attitude towards life - and where Sandrine is very good at planning and organising, Axel is a technical and practical superman. 
If the whole project would unexpectedly go wrong and we don't get the chance to live up to our promises, we'd make sure every funder gets his or her money back.

<h3>Expansion of the Night Market in 2015 </h3>
<div>
<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">To build upon last year's success, the Night Market </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">will be bigger and better. There will be more vendors, more food, more art, and more performances for attendees to explore, watch, and eat, and it will geographically cover a wider </span>space. Instead of a small parking lot like last year, the 2015 Night Market (<b>which will happen on July 3, July 4, August 7, and August 8 from 6:00 pm - midnight</b>) will take it to the streets. </div>

</div>
<div>The expansion will have a larger impact. There will be an increase in the awareness of small businesses and the vibrancy and diversity of the Minnesota Asian community.

And, like last year, we will focus on accessibility -- the Night Market will be free to all and vendors will pay a small fee to participate.</div>

Last year, Little Mekong was successful in bringing vibrancy to the local Frogtown community in the evening hours by creating new opportunities for small entrepreneurs, artists, and cultural performers. The four-night initiative of Little Mekong not only opened a window into the festive night markets in Asian countries, they also fostered a space for cultural exchange between Minnesotans from all walks of life. In order to build upon the success of 2014, we
need you to partner with us by offering financial help to expand and
enrich this year's Night Market, which will be much bigger than. 




So, what is the Little Mekong Night Market? 


The Little Mekong Night Market is the Twin Cities’s only
twilight Asian-inspired street market, located in the heart of the Little Mekong District -- the business and cultural section in St. Paul, MN that boasts a diversity of cultures, top rated restaurants, and
unique shopping experiences.

""David Simoukdalay, co-owner of Lao Thai Restaurant and one of the popular food booths at the Night Market, was surprised at the great sales. “We earned more in five hours than what we sometimes make in one day at the restaurant[.]"""" (source)
The Night Market was, in short, an absolute success and it received rave reviews. 




""The vibe is eclectic and vibrant with an authentic Asian flair and a carnival atmosphere. The diverse neighborhood turned out when we visited, as did many kids and families from all over the Twin Cities. The beautiful Chicks on Sticks stilt walkers greeted market-goers from on high, while the main stage hosted a full lineup of entertainment including a local talent open mic, Asian dance troops, bands, solo performers, hip-hop artists, a house DJ, and film screenings."" - Citypages, August 4, 2014

staging, sound, and lighting for artists and performers
artist stipends, art activities, and art supplies

recycling and trash
tents, chairs, tables, and rest areas
traffic security

To show our appreciation, we have some great perks for you! Here are a few:

    Risks, Challenges, and other ways you can help Our biggest risk and challenge is our size. Considering the success of the 2014 Night Market, many will be surprised to hear that the core staff of the Night Market only consists of 8 members.

</div><p></p><h3>Why this is going to be great!</h3><p>Hello, My name is Ryan Steele. (some of you know this ready)</p><p>I have a vision of building  a site with rental cabins in the mountain bike destination of Fruita, CO. It started with a simple idea and now I want to bring it into existence.</p><p>My vision is to have a place that is about the camaraderie and lifestyle that mountain biking brings. So even if you are not a mountain biker you will still have the best time during your stay in Fruita. </p><p><b>Located between Fruita and the famous 18 Road trails</b> you will be only 10 minutes from those trails, 20 minutes to the Kokopelli trails, 25 minutes to Rabbit Valley, 30 minutes to the Grand Junction trails and only 1.5 hours to Moab. </p><p>Aside from the plethora of biking races and events hosted by the town of Fruita and the surrounding towns, this area also offers <b>several other festivals</b> for the <b>arts,</b> <b>music</b> and <b>agricultural events</b> what this means is that from March through November there is no shortage of people coming through the area looking for lodging. </p><p>Our market analysis has shown that monies spent on lodging has increased by 225% in the last five years and with Colorado currently having the best economy in the nation, these numbers are very much likely to continue trending upward for quite some time! </p><p><b>Our cabins will feature coffee roasted locally as our complimentary coffee</b>. We will also feature local health and beauty products in our showers. The walls of the cabins will be displaying art work from local artist with the information as to how guests can purchase these items. </p><p>Don't forget what else Fruita is already known for. Like the local gourmet pizza and hand crafted beer and a world famous bike shop. Which is only a short 4 minute drive from The Hyve Cabins.  </p><p><b>There will also be a Pump track, Dirt jumps</b> and RC car track. I will also be building a <b>mile long skills loop around the property</b>. This will allow me to host the skills camps right on the property! </p><p>There will also be a <b>full bike repair station</b> and bike wash.  </p><p>Later the two silos that you see on the property will be converted to an <b>indoor climbing gym! </b></p><p>Why is it called The Hyve?</p><p>When one person finds out how great it is they will certainly head back and tell everyone what great things are going on and that they need to go there and check it out for themselves. Like a bee that found a sweet flower and wants all the other bees to go there and get some of the goodness. </p><p></p><h3>What We Need</h3><p>So here are the details:</p><p>What I'm looking for is startup funding to augment the funds that I have and give me some breathing room for the unexpected things. So that at this time I do will not have to secure a loan. Loans for startups, even one for an idea that is this good, are difficult to secure. I have about $55,000 of my own money that I am using to get this up and running.</p><p>The funds being requested will be for:</p><ul>
<li>The purchase of the cabins which will be $50,000. This includes everything from the cabin itself, to completing the interior and have them ready for rent. </li>
<li>Site preparation which will be $30,000. Things like a septic tank, foundations for the cabins, equipment rental, electrical work, access road and other requirements. </li>
<li>Engineer, which will be about $10,000, to do the site plans and permitting.</li>
<li>And any other extra costs to get the first five, hopefully more, cabins up and ready for rent. </li>
<li>This property already has power and water to it. So that is a large expense that I don't have to account for.</li>
</ul><h3>What You Get</h3>What you will get for your donation will be great!<p></p><p></p><ul>
<li>None of the perks are ""feel good"" perks. You will get something for your support.</li>

None of the perks are ""feel good"" perks. You will get something for your support.
It will range from something handmade with The Hyve branding. A mug, a shirt, cup coaster, hydration tube cover..... All the way to a weekend getaway with accommodations, skills clinic and trail tour of the local trails and much much more.
But if the goal isn't reached there is no need to worry.The Hyve is still going to be built! It just might take a little longer.
There will be three cabin types built in phases

The first type will be the Premium Cabins.
These will feature a queen bed, bunk bed and full bathroom facilities.
The second type will be The Hyve Cabins.
These will feature a queen bed and two sets of bunk beds. The shower facility will be two community type shower houses. These cabins will be in circle with a large fire pit in the center.

These will feature a full service kitchen, bathroom and two bedrooms. 


What the additional funds mean to The Hyve.What will the funds that are raised mean to this project? 
We will be able to have more cabins available when we open.
This is a new challenge for me. But I'm up for it! I'm dedicated and have a great lady behind me. 
Risks & ChallengesOf course there are a few risks. Mostly for me just trying to get a dream out of the sky and on the ground. Don't forget the challenges. I have to say that to myself regularly. The two biggest challenges are dirt and dollars. 
I am in the process of leasing some land off of 17 1/2 road (Maple Ave). I have talked to the County Planner and they seem to be in favor of this plan. The owner of the property is motivated because there has been no interested parties for 8 years. 
The second challenge is funding. Well that is why I am here. I have some but this will allow the startup to just be better.
Other Ways You Can HelpOf course it would be great it everyone could donate. But everything helps. let people know about this.

<p>In order for babies to truly thrive and reach their full potential, deep and meaningful connections to their parents and family is key. Yet many NICU's still struggle with incorporating families fully into the care team. </p> <ul> <li>Some families still have to abide by visiting hours meaning there are times of they day when they can not be with their child</li>
<li>Families are sometimes told the plan of care, rather than being asked to participate in creating that plan</li> <li>Families are often treated as visitors.... not parents</li> <li>Parents feel incredibly isolated and alone!

I am a sought out national speaker on Family Centered Care practices to staff, but why not educate the families? Teach and support them on how to be empowered to be the best advocate for their baby! </p>
<p>This campaign is to help me set up an interactive web based community class that will allow parents to connect with myself, as a professional neonatal provider, and with other parents trying to survive the NICU journey just like them! </p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>In a busy neonatal intensive care unit, parents often time feel alone despite being surrounded by other babies and families. Nurses, doctors, therapists, social workers, dietitians, chaplains, respiratory therapists..... there are so many people they meet and can lean on for support. Yet I often hear they still feel so isolated.</p>
<p>Many NICU's across the country work hard at creating and offering support groups, classes, activities and educational sessions for families, not only to provide local and convenient support, but to help them meet other families facing similar stressors. Unfortunately, these classes and opportunities are often poorly attended. Why? Parents don't want to leave their baby's bedside. Their time at the hospital is precious. When they are possibly juggling jobs, their home, other siblings, daily responsibilities, etc, when they have the time to be at the hospital they would rather spend quality time with their child and not in a class or support group. </p>
<p>That is where this campaign comes in! This on line community will provide a platform for families: </p> <ul> <li>To connect with a non-biased professional nurse to facilitate discussion and offer up suggestions on how to advocate for their child</li> <li>Meet other families across the country trying to survive the NICU experience as well</li> <li>A safe and anonymous space to share stories, express fears, state frustrations, celebrate milestones and find validity that their feelings are normal</li>
<li>A way to connect with others and receive education in the comfort of being right at their baby's bedside</li>

<li>Higher divorce rates</li>
<li>Loss of jobs due to the time demands of caring for a fragile baby</li> <li>PTSD after hospital discharge</li> <li>Stress of juggling other siblings while one is in the hospital</li>
<li>Ongoing, and sometimes life long, medical care needed for their child after leaving the NICU</li> </ul>
<div>Yet research shows that with emotional support, and having a way to connect with other families to normalize the experience, these stressors lesson dramatically.

<div>During my time as a bedside nurse and family support specialist in a very busy NICU, I often saw families comfortably sitting near their baby's bedside on their computer.

<p><strong>How You </strong><strong>Can Help Who</strong></p>
<p>Money, of course. Conventions are expensive, bigger conventions are VERY expensive! And every little bit helps! Every dollar raised goes directly into covering convention expenses (we are an all-volunteer group, so no one is getting paid to do this!). </p>
<p>And when you make a contribution to San Diego Who Con, we have a variety of ways to say thank you .

</strong><b>Why So Much?</b></p>
</div>
<p>Putting on a
convention this size is not cheap! It takes money to reserve the convention space,
put together an interesting and fun program of events, and, most importantly, arrange for a truly
exciting Guest of Honor. We are a start-up convention, so we don’t have the
cash reserves that established conventions do. That’s why we are asking for your help to get the ball rolling.</p>
<p><b>Where the money goes</b></p>
<p>Our budget:</p>
<p>Venue:
$25,000-$35,000</p>
<p>Fundraising
Events: $6,000-$8,000</p>
<p>Guests:
$30,000 - $50,000 (guest fees, travel expenses, and hotel accommodations).</p>
<p>Marketing:
$1,500-$4,500</p>
<p>Indiegogo
Incentives: $1,800-$2,500 </p>
<p>Registration
materials, programs, signs, etc. - $15,000</p>

Ok, that adds up to a lot more than our $10,000 goal! We can cover the rest with convention memberships, fundraisers and sponsorships, but that first $10,000 covers all the up-front expenses.<br/><p>

</h3> <p>First of all, thank you for clicking the link to my campaign. I am Flo Atkinson and I am a face painter/creative make-up artist. (The second one sounds better but essentially it's face paint first and foremost). The name of my business is Flourishes Face Painting. That is why I'm here asking for your help. I need the paint and equipment for all your lovely faces. I did have an ample kit, unfortunately it went walkabout (it walked off the bus!) one day near last Christmas when I was on the way home from work. This was a huge blow as it leaves me unable to work (Commercially or charitably) or fulfill any practice. <br/></p>
<p>I love my job so much, but I am in the initial stages of growing my business. This means taking as much time as possible to perfect and learn new skills so I'm able to continuously progress towards making it a full-time profession. There are many costs to starting up, and before losing the kit I was well on the way to creating enough income from a few events to fund a proper marketing campaign. I needed/still need to gather a full gallery of images to contribute to a proper website in order to become accessible to a wider audience.</p>
<p>There are many other things that would definitely help enhance my business, but I'd like to feel confident that those things can come from my own hard work and perseverance. At the moment I feel useless and static without my paints. I love to be involved in as many community events as I'm asked to participate in, it's been really difficult to turn people down - especially when I know it's time I could have spent becoming better at what I do.</p>
<p>For me, there is no better feeling than transforming somebody into a work of art. The process of creating something, which comes from visualing an individual as a canvas. Taking in their personality and applying the paint to suit; enhancing their character/beauty. Feeling/seeing the joy this manifests is priceless.</p>
<p>Help me get my paints back people! </p> </div> <div> <h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<ul>
<li>I need £500 to get the basic kit back - all of the colours, brushes and glitter that were lost. This will provide me with enough paint to see me through spring and summer. This will allow me to take part in community events which are done as a charitable donation of time and skill.</li>
<li>Whilst I do work commercially I also contribute to the community by doing free charity gigs. Please feel free to contact me about any projects that I can offer my skill to.<br/>
</li>
<li>I am a completely self-taught artist. All of my designs are created through a mixture of specific techniques and improvisation. They are customised to the individual client. I offer a range of different services and would be honored to provide something really special for any sponsors.</li>
<li>The North East is a wonderfully exciting place to be at the moment. The amount of creative cohesion across the arts is really stepping up and I feel lucky to be witnessing that unfold. I hope to one day be able to place myself within that network of incredible artists, the collaboration of vivid minds that bring the arts community together in a powerful unison. </li> <li>Any funds that are contributed will go into materials which will allow me to broaden my skill set and create designs which are unique.</li> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <ul> <li>I did a lot of soul-searching to whether launching this campaign was the right thing to do. The main thing that kept springing to mind was IS FACE PAINTING IMPORTANT ENOUGH? After asking myself this question, popping out of my mind at a rate of knots came to me many reasons why face painting is important. Here are a few:</li>
<li>
<p>It is a form of therapy, for both the
painter and the painted. A creative exchange between the two; a
chance to bring to life a very pure expression of character.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>It can allow individuals to become the
characters that live in their imagination, to truly embody them. This
transformation is a powerful and inspiring thing to witness. 
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Face paint and make-up art for me feels
like a domino effect. Once you paint somebody, it inspires creativity
within them as they walk through the world as a canvas; an enhanced
being, a new character. 
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>It blends beautifully with other art
forms; enhancing theatrical/musical performances.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Face painting is one of the first arts;
an art which dates back to the origins of human culture. It's use as
a symbol of spirituality or status, as an expression of emotion, a
tribal bond or simply to enhance beauty – it is ingrained in us
all.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>And the most important of all in my
eyes – it spreads joy! The one thing people say when I have doubts
about the importance of this job is always. “You make people
happy.” And that is enough for me. 
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul> <li>I am lucky and very grateful to have worked with brilliant people that have allowed my business to become integrated with events across the North East. One special mention would be the organisers of the wonderful yearly Vamos Festival which I will be again taking part in this year. Also, Newcastle City Council who gave me the opportunity to create designs for the New Years Eve Winter Parade. </li>
<li>I spent two summers working alongside the incredible Big Love Inflatable Church at some amazing festivals where I learnt the difference between using the same designs over and over (boring!) and improvising and customising designs to each individual. It was an invaluable and inspiring time in my life that I will never forget.<br/>
</li>
<li>I have a small website which I'd love people to have a look at : <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/FlourishesFacepainting"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://www.facebook.com/FlourishesFacepainting</a>
</li>
<li>If anyone has any feedback on the page, tips on how to improve it, what they would like to see. Constructive criticism absolutely welcome.</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, no matter what the outcome of this campaign - my passion for face painting will remain. So hopefully if you've read this, you'll see me around. I can paint your face or I can paint at your event and hopefully you'll understand what I'm talking about. </p>

Brenda and Matt Rajkovich have established Schooner Mermaid, LLC to bring classic sail tours to Baltimore.  By donating to their effort you can be a part of the launch of a 48 passenger classic sailing vessel for service in Baltimore's Inner Harbor.  By offering sailing tours as well as a venue for special events and excursions, the Mermaid will show residents and visitors an enjoyable perspective of the city and its waters that echo back to the golden age of sail.


The People


Born in Baltimore, Brenda Rajkovich is a Maryland native.
 She returned to the city in 2011 after her
husband retired from active military service. 
She is an accomplished jewelry designer and avid sailor.  Matt Rajkovich completed 20 years of service
in the US Marine Corps which included combat tours in both Afghanistan and Iraq.  He is now being licensed as a 100 ton
vessel captain.  With Baltimore as their
home they have immersed themselves in the pursuit of a livelihood that encompasses
their deep passion for sailing.  They are currently serving as crew aboard commercial motor and sailing
passenger vessels.   The Challenge

Traditional lenders
have closed their doors to this small business effort despite very strong credit, a highly regarded managerial background, and a successful business model.  However, the more funds they can raise through
this campaign the easier it will be to attract private investors for the remaining funds needed.  With your help, they
can launch the Mermaid and share the Baltimore
Harbor, Chesapeake Bay, and the story of classic sailing with thousands of
people each year.   Other Ways You Can Help  If you're unable to contribute, you can still help! Please help us spread the word among your family and friends, and check out our social media pages:

<p><b>Advertising: </b>We intend to print brochures and cards to be placed at as many local therapy facilities, family counseling centers, schools...etc. Printing 1000 business cards and 500 brochures will cost approximately $200.

<p><u><strong>Who we are</strong></u></p>
<p>A group of friends and family united by their passion for all well-crafted things.  Willie and Duro, both long-time craft beer enthusiasts, started their homebrewing adventures six years ago.  A love of fantasy fiction and medieval history/culture inspired them to try other fermentations, and so began the quest for mead.  The rest of the companions are devoting their time and talents in other key areas, as well as learning to make mead themselves. Every partner has something they specialize in.  Julie, a graduate of LVC, is our financial taskmaster, making sure we stay on budget.  Jeanette is our party and event planner, skills she learned while working at the Lancaster IU13.  Stacy worked in logistics at Hershey and is turning that career's expertise toward our supply chain.  Alfonso is a jack-of-all-trades that can build or wire anything.  Last, but not least, Ken has a broad knowledge of the culinary arts, and is a gracious host.  Together we have the skills and expertise to succeed.</p>
<p><u><strong>What is mead?</strong></u></p>
<p>Mead is simply fermented honey, but that's not all.  In addition to being gluten free and delicious, mead is inspiring. Mead is one of the most mutable libations one can work with. Bending it to one's imagination takes artistry, experience, and skill.  Its complexity can rival that of any wine or whiskey, befuddling experts with every sip.  It can be as sweet as a desert wine or as dry as a bone.  Mead can be very high in alcohol, or lightly alcoholic like a domestic beer, and anywhere in between.  The flavors typically associated with mead are that of honey, fruits of all sorts, common or exotic spices and herbs...nearly limitless combinations.  Mead can be enjoyed next to a fire whilst being sipped from a snifter, quaffed from a horn at a revel, or in a ice-filled glass doing yard work.  It is truly an amazingly versatile beverage!</p>
<p><u><strong>What is Meduseld?</strong></u></p>

<p>An old tobacco warehouse built near the turn of the last century provides our space with great wooden floors and beams.  The YMCA operates a daycare on the second floor here.  We make mead in the basement, and teach classes on how to do so as well.  Our small part of the first floor will serve as our mead hall...it's even hall shaped!  The surrounding area has seen lots of small business call it home, and it continues to attract that sort of growth.  The Lancaster Arts Hotel is right across the street, as well as The Fridge.  Our parking is across the street, next to the Lancaster YMCA proper.  It is a stone covered parking lot that has room for sixty vehicles.  The entire building is handicapped accessible through wheel chair lifts and an elevator.</p>
<p><u><strong>Our needs</strong></u></p>
<p>Our funding is just enough for us to start producing and getting the mead to flow in Lancaster, but we want to be able to do so much more for our customers.  Our small budget took a huge unexpected hit from permitting and licensing that siphoned money away.  We've been floating the business expenses while waiting on our licensing to be approved.  Add to that a new set of laws this August which allow us to sell Pennsylvania beer and spirits, for consumption on our premises, and you have a perfect storm of potentially missed opportunities.  We want to provide our patrons with the best experience possible.  Those same law changes opened up possible collaborations with some of the areas finest craft beverage artisans, but we need additional equipment, and cashflow to cover the overhead to do it right.  The money you donate will help us with purchasing additional tools and equipment for our mead hall and production.   We will also buy fermenters, tap systems, glassware, amazing spirits, mixers for cocktails, and fund our collaborative beer program.  It will also allow us to start robust barrel aging, something we are very excited to get underway!</p>
<p><u><strong>What you get</strong></u></p>
<p>We built each tier by trying to keep a balance in mind for you, as well as provide us enough money to make a huge dent in our needs.  The stacking tier model is one that we favored, because it allows the customer to choose a comfortable level to donate, while allowing for a building relationship between us and the customer.  We want to meet you and thank you in person.  Recognition for your generosity is important to us, that is why the Wall of Honor is important to us.  It will serve as a constant reminder of the people who helped us make our dream real.</p>
<p><u><strong>Risks and Challenges</strong></u></p>
<p>We have a strange set of obstacles ahead of us.  First, we need to familiarize people with mead again.  Our marketing strategy consists of a lot of outreach on social media, hosting events with other related businesses, and some traditional paths for getting the word out.  Second, our limited budget has kept our production capacity down...we can only afford so much fermenter space.  We have some workable solutions to that, such as purchasing more tanks as money comes in, and bulk storage in barrels...which will free up fermentation space.</p>

</div><div><h3> </h3></div><div> </div><div><h3> </h3></div><div><h3> </h3></div></div>","Who we are
A group of friends and family united by their passion for all well-crafted things.  Willie and Duro, both long-time craft beer enthusiasts, started their homebrewing adventures six years ago.  A love of fantasy fiction and medieval history/culture inspired them to try other fermentations, and so began the quest for mead.  The rest of the companions are devoting their time and talents in other key areas, as well as learning to make mead themselves. Every partner has something they specialize in.  Julie, a graduate of LVC, is our financial taskmaster, making sure we stay on budget.  Jeanette is our party and event planner, skills she learned while working at the Lancaster IU13.  Stacy worked in logistics at Hershey and is turning that career's expertise toward our supply chain.  Alfonso is a jack-of-all-trades that can build or wire anything.  Last, but not least, Ken has a broad knowledge of the culinary arts, and is a gracious host.  Together we have the skills and expertise to succeed.
What is mead?
Mead is simply fermented honey, but that's not all.  In addition to being gluten free and delicious, mead is inspiring. Mead is one of the most mutable libations one can work with. Bending it to one's imagination takes artistry, experience, and skill.  Its complexity can rival that of any wine or whiskey, befuddling experts with every sip.  It can be as sweet as a desert wine or as dry as a bone.  Mead can be very high in alcohol, or lightly alcoholic like a domestic beer, and anywhere in between.  The flavors typically associated with mead are that of honey, fruits of all sorts, common or exotic spices and herbs...nearly limitless combinations.  Mead can be enjoyed next to a fire whilst being sipped from a snifter, quaffed from a horn at a revel, or in a ice-filled glass doing yard work.  It is truly an amazingly versatile beverage!
What is Meduseld?
Meduseld is a word from Olde English (it ain't old enough until you add that extra 'e'), which when translated to modern English means Mead Hall.  Tolkien, who would never let a good name go to waste, borrowed it for the name of King Theoden's Hall in The Lord of The Rings.  Back in the day, a mead hall is where everything important happened in a given community.  Celebrations, battle or raid season planning, weddings and wakes all took place in the mead hall.  Our mead hall will be a welcoming place where we can explore the amazing versatility of mead, a place where you can redefine your traditions.

<h3>Building a Stronger and Healthier Hawaii by Making Strength Contagious</h3>
<p>To me, Kū means to stand firmly in who you are, to become that symbol of strength for your family and community, and to take responsibility of your life.</p>
<p>Aloha I'm Daniel Aipa, Creator and Founder of Kū Performance, a private training facility.  After spending 10 years away from Hawaii going to school, working in the health and fitness industry, and climbing my way up to be the Head Strength and Conditioning Coach at the University of Redlands for 21 collegiate sports, I moved back home 4 years ago determined to start a movement.  I created a website called The Kū Project and started Kū Performance with a vision of helping Native Hawaiians and Hawaii at large to become healthier and stronger through improving overall human performance.</p>
<p>Over the past 4 years Kū Performance has developed into a strong community of like-minded individuals who embrace the philosophy of ""Build a Kū Body and Live Kū"" because we believe our health and fitness is the ultimate asset in life, and that strength is contagious.  Over the years we have grown and we now have our first official Headquarters in Kailua, Hawaii.  A place that integrates sports performance, fitness, health, creativity, Hawaiian culture, and the Kū Lifestyle all under one roof.</p>
<p>But we need your help!  </p>
<p>Our vision for our HQ is to have a workspace where people can experience and learn diverse areas of fitness, encourage one another, and perpetuate the Hawaiian culture.  If we can reach our goal of raising $15,000 in 30 days, it will greatly assist in our efforts to build out our space to best serve our community.</p>

<p>If youʻve been following our journey, you know that Kū Performance started off as a health and fitness site <a href=""http://thekuproject.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">thekuproject.com</a> and with me training out of my driveway in Kailua.  All along Iʻve focused on building our online presence through our website and social media (<a href=""http://www.instagram.com/thekuproject"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Instagram</a>, <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/thekuproject/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Facebook</a>, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqw_tROcx1B4O2_8UM583Pw"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">YouTube</a>).</p>
<p>Four yearʻs later, after renting space at a school and another gym, and even spending time back in the driveway where we began, it's time to stand Kū and take that next step to build out our own space.  But doing so is a big deal.  This will only work if we assemble the grassroots support and Aloha which we are built upon.  </p>
<p>Your support will help us cover:</p>
<ul>
<li>Equipment and Furniture</li>
<li>Business Insurance for the year</li>
<li>Turf Area</li>
<li>Operational expenses</li>
</ul>
<p>Our goal is to reach $15,000 to get us started.  Of course, surpassing our goal would put us on cloud nine and make us more than ready to bring something unique and special to Hawaii.</p>

<p>As mentioned before, we recently leased a warehouse space in Kailua, Hawaii and have been training with what we have and doing what we do best...building Kū bodies to live Kū lives.  We like to stick with simple equipment and have a no-frills approach because we believe <i>it's not about what you have, but what you do with what you have.  </i></p>
<p>In addition to small group and private training, and classes for individuals of all ages and backgrounds, we plan to host seminars that educate the community on fitness, health, and the Hawaiian culture.  Having our own space also aids in the creation of more quality content for The Kū Project and other digital media platforms, which serves as a fitness and health resource for Hawaii.</p>
<p>When we reach our goal, we can complete the build out, and finalize the equipment we need to continue to grow and accommodate more people. </p>
<p>In exchange for your donation, you will receive all sorts of Kū perks.  There will be an opening ceremony, Kū Body Camp Classes, seminars and workshops, private training sessions, Kū Apparel, and a bunch of shakas and high fives along the way.</p>

<p>This vision isn't something that I just thought of overnight. It's been years in the making with hard work, patience, and an amazing support group (family, friends, and the Kū Project Community). Kū Performance will serve as a hub for like-minded individuals to come together to train hard, learn about fitness and health, empower one another, and perpetuate the Hawaiian culture.  I believe that a small group of strong individuals can make a big impact, which is why one of our goals is to <i>make strength contagious - </i>the stronger you become leads to a stronger influence you have on yourself and those who come in contact with you.  </p>
<p>Although the center is based in Hawaii, I believe that by sharing what it means to<i> Build a  Kū Body and Live Kū </i>and the concept of <i>striving to BE KŪ </i>we can have a global affect on those who learn about what we do.</p>
<h3>What is my experience?</h3>

<p>I promised myself that when I moved back home to Hawaii that I would build something that would make a difference for Native Hawaiians and the Hawaii community at large.  This is something that my kupuna taught me growing up - go out into the world and learn as much as possible but don't forget about home, don't forget to come back and make a difference.  </p>
<p>Well...I'm home and I'm prepared to make a difference with your help.  It's been a vision of mine for years to build a place that is based around integrating human performance, creativity, and the Hawaii culture because I truly believe it is a very powerful combination that will inspire people in and outside of Hawaii.</p>

</ul><p>We need to raise money but raising awareness is just as important!</p></div>","Why we are flying the flag for TibetCan you imagine not being allowed to fly the flag of your country? Worse still, being arrested, imprisoned and even tortured for doing so? For the people of Tibet this is an everyday reality designed to suppress their identity as Tibetans and to force them conform to Chinese rule.The Tibetan flag, which is also known as the Snow Lion flag, is a powerful symbol of Tibetan national identity but is banned in Tibet under Chinese rule. More than six million people face brutal imprisonment for owning, waving or flying their national flag. It is censored from any media in China. Today, the flag is an enduring symbol of the Tibetan people’s struggle for freedom.Standing at nearly 100 feet high, the Tibet Balloon is the largest Tibetan flag in the world and a symbol of peace and compassion. The Tibet Balloon flies around the world providing a unique and eye-catching opportunity to draw attention to the Tibetan issue and raising funds for charitable organisations working to support the cause of Tibet.The design of the Tibet Balloon faithfully follows the symbolism of the flag in a three-dimensional form. In fact the Tibet Balloon is actually two flags which means that the design can be seen from all angles. The images below show how we were able to transform the one-dimensional  plan  into a three-dimensional balloon.The story behind Tashi Gyaltsen, the Tibet BalloonThe idea for the Tibet Balloon arose out of the passion and expertise of two people with an interest in both hot air ballooning and the issues facing the Tibetan people.Heaven Crawley has worked with refugees for more than 20 years and most recently has been working with young Tibetans in Sikkim, North East India. Some of these young people visited the UK as part of the TibetXChange programme and during their visits to schools and colleagues talked about the importance and symbolism of the Tibetan flag. Heaven and her husband Paul Dopson are also commercial hot air balloon pilots who have flown at numerous hot air balloon meets and fiestas around the world. They know that balloons attract huge amounts of public interest and that the photographs of them flying are circulated far and wide on via social media.Heaven and Paul have often flown the Tibet flag from their own balloon and many people have asked about its meaning and significance. One day they had an idea…why not build a hot air balloon in the design of the Tibet flag so that it could be seen by thousands of people raising awareness of the Tibetan issue?And so the idea for the Tibet Balloon was born!Over a six month period Heaven and Paul worked closely with the Office of Tibet and the Tibetan Community in Britain to develop their ideas and to raise funds for the project and over the months that followed a number of very generous individuals made donations to enable the balloon to be put into production.In July 2015, after months of planning and fund raising, the Tibet Balloon took to the skies for the first time at the Buddhist Monastery of Garraf in northern Spain. The balloon was blessed by the Most Venerable Jamyang Tashi Dorje Rinpoche in front of a gathered crowd of monks, Buddhist practitioners, Tibetan supporters and the national media.

She has flown in five European countries (France, the Netherlands, UK, Spain and Italy) and on November 2016 she made her first appearance in Latin America when she flew in Mexico.  Tashi has a very strong following on social media and many of the photos and videos taken at these events are shared around the world.The sight of the world’s largest Tibetan flag flying in front of thousands of people has not gone unnoticed by the Chinese authorities.  Mysterious individuals purporting to be Chinese embassy officials have made numerous attempts to ground the Tibet Balloon.

Vår uppstart har gått bra, men det måste bli ännu bättre om vi ska kunna fortsätta driva butiken. Och med ditt stöd, en egen lokal med plats för fler spännande lösviktsprodukter så kan det bli verklighet. Se nedan hur din donation hjälper oss.Vår nya lokal ligger vid St Knut nära till Möllan, Folkets Park och Triangeln. Här planerar vi för att göra plats för ytterligare 50 produkter och även börja sälja färsk, lokalt odlad frukt och grönt.Grams grundare, Rowan, har personligen investerat i den första fasen av affären, men ber nu alla som älskar konceptet och vill se det växa att hjälpa till.Vår nya lokal vid St Knuts torget Vad vi behöver & vad du fårVi har som mål att samla in 120 000 SEK / € 12500 för att täcka kostnaderna för:
Grundläggande utrustning och möbler för att göra butiker mer effektiv och erbjuda kunder fler valmöjligheter och produkter – kylar, en kaffekvarn, grönsaksdisplay, behållare till ca 50 nya produkter (varje bulkbehållare kostar ca. 800 kr).
En plats att hålla workshops och föreläsningar om ”zero-waste” och andra teman relaterade till hållbarhet.
Reparationer och renoveringar av den nya butiken – installation av ett litet kök, bygge av förvaringsutrymmen, omputsning av väggar, sätta upp belysning.
 Förmåner/""Perks""Som tack för din hjälp erbjuder vi en rad fina ""perks"". Vad sägs till exempel om ett ”zero-waste” starter kit som hjälper dig att komma igång? Ett års rabatt på våra produkter eller varför inte en personlig ”zero-waste” coachning med Grams grundare, Rowan? Välj den belöning som intresserar dig och din plånbok.

Vi banar vägen för ett mer hållbart sätt att handla mat. Allt säljs förpackningsfritt i lösvikt. Vi uppmuntrar och gör det lätt för människor att ta med sig sina egna återanvändbara förpackningar. Detta så att de slipper slänga något när de kommer hem.Vi erbjuder idag ca 170 olika produkter, inklusive torrvaror (pasta, ris, bönor, müsli, nötter, kryddor, sötsaker, m.m.), flytande varor (oljor, vinäger, honung och sirap) och hushållsprodukter (diskmedel, tvål, tvättmedel, m.m.).Butiken i Malmö SaluhallVarför förpackningsfria?I Sverige slänger vi ca 480 kg hushållsskräp per person per år. I en värld där temperaturerna ökar och haven fylls av plast, är det viktigt att vi tänker om. Så att vi hittar sätt att minska vårt avfall.Gram har ambitionen att skapa en vändning i Sveriges skräpproblem, genom att tillhandahålla sätt att handla mat med färre förpackningar. Samt genom att skapa ett forum för inspiration och diskussion kring en ”zero-waste” livsstil.Vi har redan kickstartat en rörelse i Sverige och hjälper nu andra butiker att öppna runtom i landet, till exempel i Stockholm och Lund. Men vi vill göra mer. Och med din hjälp kan vi göra det.Andra sätt du kan hjälpa tillOm du inte har möjlighet att bidra ekonomiskt är vi ändå väldigt tacksamma om du hjälper till att sprida information om Gram och vår crowdfunding-kampanj på sociala medier och till dina vänner.

<p><strong>THE CHICKENS – NO ANTIBIOTICS EVER.</strong><br/>When we started searching for a purveyor we had a few non- negotiables in mind.  First, we would only procure the most humanely raised and processed birds.  Second, we would only serve chicken that was free of hormones and antibiotics. And third, that we would be able to meet the farmers and the chickens in person.  We are so fortunate to have been able to find exactly what we were looking for in Coleman Natural Foods™. Shortly after meeting the team from Coleman, we were invited to spend a morning on one of their chicken farms in Dover, DE – about 80 miles south of Philadelphia. We learned so much about how the birds are raised, what they eat and how they are ultimately processed.  We saw healthy, happy birds that live in a temperature controlled house with lots of light – and on warm sunny days can leave their shelter to roam free on the farm’s property.  Most importantly, Coleman birds are NO ANTIBIOTICS EVER. This is different from Antibiotic Free – and it’s an important distinction to understand.  Antibiotic Free means that a farmer can give the birds antibiotics up two weeks before processing believing it should be metabolized by the bird before it reaches your plate.  NO ANTIBIOTICS EVER means just that…  Coleman does not use any antibiotics ever with their birds. </p>

THE CHICKENS – NO ANTIBIOTICS EVER.When we started searching for a purveyor we had a few non- negotiables in mind.  First, we would only procure the most humanely raised and processed birds.  Second, we would only serve chicken that was free of hormones and antibiotics. And third, that we would be able to meet the farmers and the chickens in person.  We are so fortunate to have been able to find exactly what we were looking for in Coleman Natural Foods™. Shortly after meeting the team from Coleman, we were invited to spend a morning on one of their chicken farms in Dover, DE – about 80 miles south of Philadelphia. We learned so much about how the birds are raised, what they eat and how they are ultimately processed.  We saw healthy, happy birds that live in a temperature controlled house with lots of light – and on warm sunny days can leave their shelter to roam free on the farm’s property.  Most importantly, Coleman birds are NO ANTIBIOTICS EVER. This is different from Antibiotic Free – and it’s an important distinction to understand.  Antibiotic Free means that a farmer can give the birds antibiotics up two weeks before processing believing it should be metabolized by the bird before it reaches your plate.  NO ANTIBIOTICS EVER means just that…  Coleman does not use any antibiotics ever with their birds. 
Here’s a great video from our day at the farm and further explanation on the difference between antibiotics free and NO ANTIBIOTICS EVER.After the farm we headed another hour south to the Perdue Processing Plant in Milford, DE. We were so impressed with the humane methods this plant uses in processing the birds and the safety and sanitation practices that are enforced throughout the entire plant. We’re so proud to be able to say we’re in business with Coleman and the iconic American brand Perdue. OUR STORY(We know this is in 1st and 3rd person, but we don't always follow the rules.)Our story starts in 2007 when we met at The Culinary Institute of America.  Laura, a ‘95 CIA grad and went back to work at the school in 2006 where Todd was a student… scandal.  We bonded over our love of Philadelphia; coincidently both being from this area but having met in upstate NY.  The PG version of this story is we met, flirted, fell in love, and have been inseparable ever since.  There is a much more indecent version of this story, but we don’t know you that well yet so don’t make it weird.  You get the picture.  In 2011 we moved back to Philadelphia together and had a foodie dream wedding at DiBruno Bros. Todd, an ACF Certified Executive Chef worked in restaurants for many years before heading to culinary school.  After moving to Philly, he was with Aramark at Citizens Bank Park and the LINC and most recently and notably was senior research and development chef for Campbell’s Soup across the bridge in Camden, NJ.

</div></div>","About Ourselves:  
Hello everyone, our names are Milan and Andoni. Milan is the coordinator of Indra Organic Village and I am a student volunteering in Nepal. Milan has been developing this idea for long time ago and I am just helping him starting the project. We are planning to develop the whole idea in the long term so the crowd funding campaign will be just the beginning. We hope that this first step is successful so we can continue to work in this project and many others to come.
About Project:
Indra Organic Village is a project established to help connecting local grassroots level farmers to organic aware consumers for promoting their locally grown organic products in the villages of Nepal. The main objective of the project is to improve the livelihoods and day by day lifestyle of local communities by marketing their locally made organic products. By producing organic products in an eco-friendly way we aim to optimize quality production in all aspects of agriculture and environment, making sure it is the best for both the customer and the soil.
We appeal you to be a part of our social cause by supporting our Indiegogo campaign; which will greatly help us to expand our network and provide fair prices to more farmers. We take responsibility for the entire supply chain - from production to packaging and distribution - and eliminate the unnecessary role of middlemen in order to ensure economic empowerment of more farmers who have been exploited by middlemen till now! Let’s make this collective effort a great initiative for helping the small farmers in Nepal! 
What We Need:
Our campaign is aimed for raising the amount $ 3000 needed to establish and organic shop outlet for Indra Organic Village. 
 
Your contributions will be used to cover:
 

Shop Outlet rent
Lorries rent for Product Shipment.
Buying products (To anticipate money to the farmers)
Packaging Products
Operations, Taxes and Media Outreach  

 
When costs are covered the remaining money will be used with social purposes in the local community, in projects like community learning centers, children schools or farmers training.
 
 
How We Reward You?
 
You can help us achieving this goal by donating our Indigogo campaign, and you will be given different gifts in gratitude. We value greatly every donation and any amount of Contribution from you, but if you give more than US $ 50, to thank you we would like to offer the choice of the following gifts:

$ 50 and above      Indra Organic Village Green Tea from Nepal (250 gm.)

<b>THOUGHTFUL EXPRESSIONS OF NATURE</b>

<div>Despite the challenges of farming, we love our peaceful farm and our new home. This new life has inspired us in many ways. The farm has become our creative playground. The lavender, roses, tea, butterflies, bees, birds and other living elements have become our regular companion inspiring us with ""<i>Thoughtful Expressions of Nature.""  </i>In a short period of time, we were able to develop thoughtfully designed exclusive products we think are worth sharing.  As nature inspires art and beautiful music in our hearts, our signature collection is full of music, colors, stunning details, and unique artful designs reflecting the immense beauty of nature around us.</div>

<div>This signature exclusive collection brings back the magic of handmade, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q990E-DnFMQ"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">hand-blown</a> and hand-painted products. At senior age, our creative imagination has been refreshed, renewed, and sharpened by nature.  All the designs are based upon natural elements we see in and around our farm.  Imelda personally designed every piece and even wrote songs inspired by Blue Dreams USA, and our love for the world we live in.  Check the video, to see how how one of our hand-blown glass vases was made.  Each piece takes three days to cure.  </div>

<h3>Our Blue Dreams USA Farm</h3>

<div>Strategically located near major cities of Washington, DC, Baltimore, Northern Virginia and other outlying areas of West Virginia and Pennsylvania, we hope one day you can come visit us and a spend a moment with us.  </div>
<div>The gift of nature all around us a gift we wish to share back to our community and you! We were blessed to be stewards of this land and it is not our own to just keep for ourselves. Hence, despite the challenges of getting permits to open this to the public, we expect to open in late Spring-Summer 2016. In the future, we see our farm not only bursting with natural scents and colors of flowers, but will showcase what we can do with a small farm like ours. </div>
</div> <div> <h3>The Impact - Simple Dream. Grand in Spirit!</h3> <p>The work we do in our farm is a celebration of the importance of farming and the love for nature. We have year-round crops planted by farmers who rely on soya, corn, barley, and wheat for a living.  We also have other plans in the future for vegetables and fruit bearing trees, so your help will help us continue what we have began. For the love of nature, our goal for our farm is for it to be sustainable and eco-friendly.  </p>

<p>Our small contributions will help in the world's conservation efforts.  Every plant and tree we plant will help in this.  The almost ten acres of forest space is one that we value that in July 2014, we entered in Forest Stewardship Plan with the State of Maryland. This means that we are committed to keeping the trees surrounding our open space and to maintain this forest through effective weed control practices and crop tree management.</p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">However, we recognize that farming is not easy so we have designed our agri-business in such a way we have other sources of revenues like our exclusive products you see in this campaign. This will allow us to sell online in addition to live plants we will only sell in our farm.  Your gift of support will give something to all of us to enjoy.  In return we will give you our nature-inspired perks only available at Blue Dreams USA.  </span></p>

We bought this small farm in 2004 with a dream rooted from our love for nature, fruits, vegetables, flowers, and a clean, eco-friendly environment.  Just like millions of people, we set aside our dreams for a long time for a more stable corporate career.  It was only about two years ago that we realized the opportunity to fulfill our dreams through our farm.  We took a leap of faith, gave up a lot of life's conveniences, and downsized our home.

The blue birds and the butterflies were also there to perk us up inspiring some of our signature work.   
We want to share this awesome feelings with you as we capture this inspiration from living elements in our farm. For example, take a look at this nine-inch tall vase inspired by Blue Fortune flowers and blue butterfly, and a stunning blue birds glass nest with three eggs.  This last piece captures a moment with grand kids hunting eggs during Easter. Both exclusive glass arts come with a wish for good fortune and happiness. It is one of the perks to thank you for your support!

Your gift of love means more birds and butterflies will have a safe haven, more kids can play safely at our farm!""- Imelda

THE CHALLENGE OF FARMING
Since we moved to our farm in March 2014, we learned first hand that farming is not an easy thing.  We have come to appreciate farmers even more.  It means hard work, perspiration, physical pain, not to mention poison ivy, weeds, snakes, stink bugs, plant diseases, harsh weather, and more.  This is especially true for Jeff who retired from corporate work.  Now, he is doing most of the hard work in our farm.


Planting our first lavenders in Fall 2013

But, just imagine if we do not support our farmers and agricultural lands.  This made us more passionate about our dream and commitment to sustain and maintain the agricultural nature and natural beauty of our farm for you, our family, and community to enjoy.  
OUR VISION: From the food we eat, to the drink we drink, to products we bathe with and put on our skin, over time, we envisioned to pull together various elements in our farm that will showcase our love for nature and Mother Earth.   Our goal is to maintain the agricultural nature and make our farm
sustainable, eco-friendly.
To ensure we achieve this goal, we are now developing a farm-based business around Lavender, Roses & Tea, three plants we love most.  After all, lavenders are known as ""Blue Gold"" for their diversity of uses and amazing values. Roses are the most beloved flowers and our favorite; while the tea is the most consumed beverage next to water.  The simple joy of being around nature and what we love made us feel young!

Aside from live plants, we are developing value-added natural products derived from these plants.  In the future we have other plans for additional products, fruits and vegetables. As we progress, with your help, you will find these products available along with various tea blends, handmade soaps, essential oils, sachets, and much more. You will be able to buy all our products and visit the farm when we open our farm to the public in 2016. 



THOUGHTFUL EXPRESSIONS OF NATURE

Despite the challenges of farming, we love our peaceful farm and our new home. This new life has inspired us in many ways. The farm has become our creative playground. The lavender, roses, tea, butterflies, bees, birds and other living elements have become our regular companion inspiring us with ""Thoughtful Expressions of Nature.""  In a short period of time, we were able to develop thoughtfully designed exclusive products we think are worth sharing.  As nature inspires art and beautiful music in our hearts, our signature collection is full of music, colors, stunning details, and unique artful designs reflecting the immense beauty of nature around us.

This signature exclusive collection brings back the magic of handmade, hand-blown and hand-painted products. At senior age, our creative imagination has been refreshed, renewed, and sharpened by nature.  All the designs are based upon natural elements we see in and around our farm.  Imelda personally designed every piece and even wrote songs inspired by Blue Dreams USA, and our love for the world we live in.  Check the video, to see how how one of our hand-blown glass vases was made.  Each piece takes three days to cure.  

 
The Cobalt Lavender Blossom Vase is one of the perks in this campaign.
We also have  many beautiful and stunning photographs that have been turned into works of art.  In 2016, we will publish and release a ""tea-table"" colorful book to share our moments with nature, our Moments with Raleigh, our dog who enjoyed our farm so much, but he is no longer with us to enjoy the fruits of our hard work. Diagnosed with cancer to live for only three months, he stayed on for over a year enjoying Imelda's lavender cookies.  We also have so many beautiful photos showcasing our ""Thoughtful Expressions of Nature"" and ""Raleigh's Moments.""





Embarking in something fresh, creative and beautiful is a new challenge, but tremendously exciting and purpose-driven!  You can begin a new life at any age and our exclusive product designs capture the imagination of all ages.
Our very first Indiegogo campaign focuses on our exclusive signature collection, ""Thoughtful Expressions of Nature,"" nature-inspired gifts handmade lovingly. This includes handpainted  ""Tea Time Moments"" Tea Pot Sets Collection, hand-blown glass, arts and more.  






Our Blue Dreams USA Farm

Strategically located near major cities of Washington, DC, Baltimore, Northern Virginia and other outlying areas of West Virginia and Pennsylvania, we hope one day you can come visit us and a spend a moment with us.  
The gift of nature all around us a gift we wish to share back to our community and you! We were blessed to be stewards of this land and it is not our own to just keep for ourselves. Hence, despite the challenges of getting permits to open this to the public, we expect to open in late Spring-Summer 2016. In the future, we see our farm not only bursting with natural scents and colors of flowers, but will showcase what we can do with a small farm like ours. 
  The Impact - Simple Dream. Grand in Spirit! The work we do in our farm is a celebration of the importance of farming and the love for nature. We have year-round crops planted by farmers who rely on soya, corn, barley, and wheat for a living.  We also have other plans in the future for vegetables and fruit bearing trees, so your help will help us continue what we have began. For the love of nature, our goal for our farm is for it to be sustainable and eco-friendly.  


Our small contributions will help in the world's conservation efforts.  Every plant and tree we plant will help in this.  The almost ten acres of forest space is one that we value that in July 2014, we entered in Forest Stewardship Plan with the State of Maryland. This means that we are committed to keeping the trees surrounding our open space and to maintain this forest through effective weed control practices and crop tree management.
However, we recognize that farming is not easy so we have designed our agri-business in such a way we have other sources of revenues like our exclusive products you see in this campaign. This will allow us to sell online in addition to live plants we will only sell in our farm.  Your gift of support will give something to all of us to enjoy.  In return we will give you our nature-inspired perks only available at Blue Dreams USA.  
As we are on retirement age, yet a life of new beginnings, we also hope the success of our venture will prove that dreams can be attained at whatever age we are in.  Our love for nature is also a commitment to pass on this legacy to our children and grandchildren.  This is the grandest of all!

In our farm, our children and grandchildren can play safely just like what we had when we were young.  Everyone, young and old can visit our farm and enjoy the beautiful scenery. Walk through the fields or hike through the woods.  This we hope is our ultimate legacy to our community. 
For Your Gift of Support - A Gift of Nature!
From our farm to your home, please bring the love of nature into your home sweet home through our Thoughtful Expressions of Nature signature collection.  Your support will help us continue what we have begun in our farm to make it a place worth visiting and a moment to remember for you and our guests. It will help us sustain its agricultural nature for our community to enjoy!  For  now your ""Moments with Nature"" comes in the form of perks all inspired by nature. 


Through your early support, order and feedback, we can also determine which among the exclusive products will be popular. With this valuable input, we can focus our funds to producing those that are more viable designs.  We will use the funds to produce larger quantities and carry those popular items in our farm boutique and in our online store for larger numbers of people to enjoy. Your help will also bring additional products such as lavender soaps and oils, and special blends of tea to drink.  We hope to grow more plants and trees for generations to enjoy!
In exchange for your help, you will be among the first to receive our exclusive designs as perks.  We have limited quantities available for delivery before the holiday gift giving.  Those perks are marked ""EARLY BIRD.""  All others will have to wait when we open our farm boutique in late Spring/Summer 2016. 


Perk Up Your Holiday with a Gift of Nature!
Our creative designs bring back the magic of hand-painted, hand-blown, handmade artisan quality items.  We have produced limited quantities for immediate delivery so you can see that these designs are all REAL and not just a concept.  
Being able to introduce our exclusively designed signature collection inspired by nature, lavender, roses and tea here at Indiegogo is heartening.  


Shipping & Other Info


WHEN WE WILL SHIP:  Early bird supporters will get the items in time for the holidays.  Orders received for the final week of the campaign ending December 10th, will be shipped the week of December 15th. 
WHERE WE SHIP:  Depending on the item, we will ship to the US 48 Contiguous States and Canada on ""Early Bird"" perks such as teapot sets and hand-blown glass. 
WORLDWIDE SHIPMENT:  For music and books, these are available for worldwide shipping at book rate, with digital music ready for immediate downloads.  The ""tea-table"" book will be shipped when it is released in Summer 2016.  
International delivery of hand-blown glass pieces and tea pot sets may be arranged with shipping cost to be paid by buyer based upon locations. You may contact us for shipping and you can pay the extra shipping cost by way of contributions.

LIMITED QUANTITIES:  Once this initial limited quantities are all claimed or sold out, we will accept pre-order for 2016 delivery.  Hand-painted tea pot sets and hand-blown glass take time to finish.  Hence, our next shipment after we sold out will be late Spring/Summer 2016. 
NATURE OF PRODUCTS: The challenge of producing hand-painted, hand-blown and handmade products is the limitation on how many we can produce. To this end, we hope you act early so you can be among the first to get some pieces available for immediate delivery. 
Due to the nature of handmade, hand-painted, and hand-blown products, details such as colors, detailed finish, and weight may vary.

μεράκι (me'raci)
care /substantive, zest /male,  passion /feminine
Else - Otherwise  
[μεράκι, το] [me'raci, the] care, craftsmanship by heart, true interest
  
“itGReat”
 is a venture that was born out of “meraci” of three individuals who share the same values regarding health & wellbeing, a 
deep love for their country and most of all great respect for the 
history and tradition of their own birth land, the “blessed Cretan 
Terra”. Abstaining from all impersonal and faceless norms of 
market logic with set to cater prospective clients and the 
public through quality principles of service and a high sense of 
accountability.Our first step was to use technology
to communicate our plan. We created a platform that combines an informational blog,
e-shop, & free services, based on the values ​​of the Cretan Mediterranean diet and its unique functional food properties. 
Create a series of modern nutritional tools, as well as an 
opportunity for sound advice through consultants and services accessible
 on daily basis through the nutritional Blog portal located in  www.itgreatchoice.com
Disseminate
 some of our deep “meraci” & nostalgia for numerous amazing tastes and
 flavors that have been registered into our memory when children playing
 in grandma’s kitchen. 
Help respect small cultivators who are the only ones to offer
 forgotten authentic taste experiences we love, through authentic recipes,
 and provide an opportunity to sample the “old” culinary ways and adopt 
habits beneficial for health and life. 
Supports 
growers hard efforts and persistence to keep traditional methods and 
ways of cultivation to help them preserve the quality of their products.
Our goal was to offer this uniqueness
together high quality standards, from  production to consumption,
using as start point our land  &
finish your doorstep.
After 2 years of hard work, without any financial support, our efforts become something visible - 
A lot of what we did & still try to do…philosophy & vision can be found on following 
sections, our videos and website.  This is what we did,
a tiny step to where we want to go._____________________________________________________________________________
So... we are here to talk about why we need you.
- Why we can’t go on without your help.  
- Share our dream … and
its  obstacles 
- Offer opportunities to embark in a journey like no other…

                 

TO PROMOTE HEALTH & WELL BEING: to service people who regard food quality, proper nutrition knowledge / 
practices and natural care products as integral parts of an 
effort to preserve and promote health and consider them absolutely 
necessary in achieving well-being.
Provide Access to :  Food products of highest standard & Ways of quality consumption, Quality cosmetics, Knowledge and  Nutrition services through selected, dietetic professionals.  Select
& support product cultivators by strict and traditional reliability 
standards with distinct products based on nutritional and taste value. Exceptional cosmetics made of the purest, natural ingredients that may cover and array of skin care needs. Information & nutrition advice: Discuss current nutritional issues and ambivalent nutrition information. Provide specific nutritional advice and insight.

I’ve recently been contacted through the University by an energetic and visionary Workers Cooperative (AWC) in Sierra Leone, one of the poorest countries in Africa. Their idea is simple and yet revolutionary: help their manufacturing company to get out from the Ebola-triggered difficulty; import the cooperative idea; have a strong say in the company Board; basically became owners of their workplace!</p>

The workers were of enormous help to build an awesome supply chain – in the most challenging of environments and achieve good productivity goals. The first few years saw unfortunately a few production problems (boiler, generator, filler) but the boys learned from the mistakes and grew from strength to strength.

<h3>Why are we here? What has gone wrong in this innovative reality?<br/>
</h3>
<p>The company started with limited capital (in 2010 the biggest financial crisis after WWII had only just finished, remember?) and relied on local banks for working capital – a very important feature, for a seasonal production business, at a whopping 23% (later 18%) interest rate. Which when you earn in dollars and spend in local currency could be ok, if the latter continued to devaluate as it did after the civil war.</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, it didn’t and from 2011 to 2013 AFJ suffered the ‘<b>perfect storm</b>’, with low end product prices (juice concentrate is a commodity, after all), unfavourable exchange rate, high fuel prices (did we tell you that AFJ is not on the electric grid and all the power needs to come from a generator?) and some production teething problem.</p>
<p>When we thought we had seen it all, then Ebola came! Nobody suffered among the factory workers and in the surrounding villages but the country virtually stopped working and export became extremely difficult. Imagine that Ghana for instance imposed a total import ban from Sierra Leone, without any logic.</p>
<p>Now AFJ is back on track, but really need to raise more capital to stop paying interest to the bank and build a strong future for workers and farmers.<br/><br/></p>
<h3 style=""font-weight: bold;"">What has been the workers'reaction to all these adversities?</h3>
<p>After the terrible effects of the Ebola crisis were clear, there were only two ways to react: being passive and wait for the events to decide your future, or face the situation head on and try to do your best to change it! The latter has been the answer for AFJ’s workers, the real main characters of this campaign!</p>
<p>I’ve been contacted by Marie Charles, the accountant of the company. She got all the workers together and decided to do a revolutionary action to preserve their “home”: finance the part of capital the company needs and become, as they always felt to be , an <b>active part</b> within it!<br/></p>
<p>A Cooperative has been founded, <b>AFJ Workers Cooperative, (AWC)</b> that is now the vehicle through which this Will is operating, a Will that has been developed during the past 4 years, but that presently is looking for a future!<br/>This is something really trailblazer, and as the say goes “<i>The flower that blooms in adversity is the rarest and most beautiful of all</i>”, this idea stimulated me to help them with all my passion and ability!They can’t accept to lose something they feel to belong, something they have seen growing up day by day: literally!  More than the 80% of the current workers are the very builders of all the factory premises!<br/>When I say that this is their <b>home</b>, I’m not exaggerating: they have assembled it, they got it to run, they have develop it and now they are trying to improve it!This would be the very first experience in Sierra Leone in which workers could be able to become at the same time employer and employees, revolutionizing from the core the usual top-down ownership system in the developing world!<br/><span style=""font-weight: normal;""> Presently, AWC members are collecting what money they can to start become Owners</span>.</p>

<p>The Republic of Sierra Leone, is a West African country, in which approximately 6 million people from several ethnic groups live. Sierra Leone has a glorious past, with Freetown being the biggest settlement of freed slaves in Africa and with Fourah Bay College being the first university in Sub-Saharian Africa. Annie Welsh School was also the first girls only school in the continent. When independence was achieved in 1961, with the many natural resources, educated working force and an enviable location, the future looked bright.</p>
<p>It wasn’t to be. The more recent past of this country hasn’t been the luckiest, in fact the population suffered a terrible civil war which affected it for over a decade. The war, fueled by greed of foreign governments and strong illegal arm lobbies, became notorious for its hand chopping atrocities and for the Blood Diamond movie.</p>
<p>This obviously hindered proper development, relegating Sierra Leone at 183 out of 187 position on the most recent Human Development Index, the most important indicator of the quality of life in a country. The more worrying data about this index that includes all the most important measures of wellness of a country is the child mortality, one of the worst in the world: 148 out of 1000 deaths.</p>
<p>After the civil war the economy of the country tried to create a safe path to the development, but has been seriously threatened by the tremendous effects of the notorious Ebola outbreak: since spring 2014 more than 5000 died and almost 14.000 cases have been certified.<br/></p>
<h3><b>What is our reply to all these adversities?<br/></b></h3>
<p>Rather than be persuaded to accept this unfair reality the AFJ’s workers decided to risk everything and fight for it! It appears to be almost a contradiction, but it’s not hard to understand: <i>“It is impossible to win the great prizes of life without running risks, and the greatest of all prizes are those connected with home” </i>(Theodore Roosevelt).<br/>This is an incredible example of perseverance that everybody, as human being, has to appreciate: the change is possible and it’s just a step away!<br/>A powerful proof of the resilient capacity the AFJ workers have developed during their work experience, has occurred facing the Ebola crisis.<br/>In fact not only they decided to keep working even in adverse and dangerous condition, but they have been able to run the production with a completely local crew!<br/></p>
<p>This campaign aim involves a community on 360 degrees basis: starting from work, then families and most important the future.</p>

But I guess I'm already there..”
(Talking Heads-This must be the place)

Hello, I’m Saverio Lenzi, I’m a student and will graduate in Cooperation at the University of Florence next spring. I’ve recently been contacted through the University by an energetic and visionary Workers Cooperative (AWC) in Sierra Leone, one of the poorest countries in Africa. Their idea is simple and yet revolutionary: help their manufacturing company to get out from the Ebola-triggered difficulty; import the cooperative idea; have a strong say in the company Board; basically became owners of their workplace!
I’m here to spread the message and help them empower themselves. Own the workplace as they own their Home!

Why this campaign?
T0 find donors for the finance of AWC, the workers Cooperative, to help the juice manufacturing company they work for:  Africa Felix Juice.  
How will be the money used?

If we reach the target, the company will be able NOT to need a local bank to pre-finance production.If only part of the money is raised, then the interest payment will only be lower.In ANY case, the Cooperative will have a seat in the Company Board, ensuring a more democratic governance.To start with, 

what exactly is this company?Africa Felix Juice (AFJ) was born on October 2010, by a joint effort of a group of people from all over the world with a progressive and sustainable idea of business and a love for development and for Africa.

They received a conditional grant by the Dutch Government, on a scheme called PSI.AFJ proudly claims to provide the 1st Made in Sierra Leone manufactured product the country has EVER exported.The factory produces fruit juice concentrate of pineapples, mangoes, cashew apples and papayas, all indigenous crops, which are collected from over 4,000 mainly subsistence farmers in the country.The Dutch government has also helped AFJ to embrace values of fairness and respect for workers: equal opportunity job, two members of the senior management are women; no to under-age workers and fair treatment of all the 42 workers, ensuring a 30% higher wage than the legal minimum pay.The company achieved Fairtrade certification in 2012 (suspended in 2014) and in the same year passed a stringent audit by German independent industry body SGF, showing that production standards can be the same in Africa as in Europe. The workers were of enormous help to build an awesome supply chain – in the most challenging of environments and achieve good productivity goals. The first few years saw unfortunately a few production problems (boiler, generator, filler) but the boys learned from the mistakes and grew from strength to strength. Imagine that in 2015 they managed 45 production days with a crew of only locals.

Why are we here? What has gone wrong in this innovative reality?

The company started with limited capital (in 2010 the biggest financial crisis after WWII had only just finished, remember?) and relied on local banks for working capital – a very important feature, for a seasonal production business, at a whopping 23% (later 18%) interest rate. Which when you earn in dollars and spend in local currency could be ok, if the latter continued to devaluate as it did after the civil war.
As a matter of fact, it didn’t and from 2011 to 2013 AFJ suffered the ‘perfect storm’, with low end product prices (juice concentrate is a commodity, after all), unfavourable exchange rate, high fuel prices (did we tell you that AFJ is not on the electric grid and all the power needs to come from a generator?) and some production teething problem.
When we thought we had seen it all, then Ebola came! Nobody suffered among the factory workers and in the surrounding villages but the country virtually stopped working and export became extremely difficult. Imagine that Ghana for instance imposed a total import ban from Sierra Leone, without any logic.
Now AFJ is back on track, but really need to raise more capital to stop paying interest to the bank and build a strong future for workers and farmers.
What has been the workers'reaction to all these adversities?
After the terrible effects of the Ebola crisis were clear, there were only two ways to react: being passive and wait for the events to decide your future, or face the situation head on and try to do your best to change it! The latter has been the answer for AFJ’s workers, the real main characters of this campaign!
I’ve been contacted by Marie Charles, the accountant of the company. She got all the workers together and decided to do a revolutionary action to preserve their “home”: finance the part of capital the company needs and become, as they always felt to be , an active part within it!
A Cooperative has been founded, AFJ Workers Cooperative, (AWC) that is now the vehicle through which this Will is operating, a Will that has been developed during the past 4 years, but that presently is looking for a future!This is something really trailblazer, and as the say goes “The flower that blooms in adversity is the rarest and most beautiful of all”, this idea stimulated me to help them with all my passion and ability!They can’t accept to lose something they feel to belong, something they have seen growing up day by day: literally!  More than the 80% of the current workers are the very builders of all the factory premises!When I say that this is their home, I’m not exaggerating: they have assembled it, they got it to run, they have develop it and now they are trying to improve it!This would be the very first experience in Sierra Leone in which workers could be able to become at the same time employer and employees, revolutionizing from the core the usual top-down ownership system in the developing world! Presently, AWC members are collecting what money they can to start become Owners.
Are you willing to help them?
Your help will be incredibly useful to realize our dream and succeed keeping this reality alive and get it to prosper. The money need can’t obviously come entirely from the worker finances! All what we will be able to collect with this campaign will go directly to the cooperative, AFW Workers Cooperative , through a banking account at First International Bank in Sierra Leone and it will be used only to buy shares of Africa Felix Juice!You can be able to be witness and advocate of a pioneer idea of company governance and, above all, be able to help the 42 worker’s families and the 4000 farmers to continue believe in their dream: develop their country and community with their own resources!Give a better chance to Sierra Leone and to AFJ workers!

climb to attain these accolades. All small entrepreneurs—regardless of whether
they produce handbags, rear livestock, offer HR services, bed and breakfast,
renovation or are engaged in something else entirely, are required to master
highly-technical skills. To survive, they must understand the intricacies of

SMEs are notoriously understaffed and short on technical knowledge, the acquisition of which further limits the time and funds they have to spend on their main business. <b>Money and time are hard to come by</b> and yet without investing in promotion of the company, how can it be expected to grow? </div><div><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1447071470/vxxuqq1hbkonk8s7tivj.png"" src="""" style=""cursor: nw-resize;""/></p></div><div>Many SMEs resort to building their brand instead of developing their primary product or service. The Internet is a mighty tool and most SMEs begin by commissioning a website, as a platform to promote themselves. But that takes meticulous planning, investment in R&amp;D and then more investment in maintenance and promotion, potentially adding up to thousands of dollars in the first months, when the company is most vulnerable to financial pressure. </div><div>
<b>Would it not be nice  if all of the above could be taken care of by powerful professionals, leaving the entrepreneur to focus on his or her core business?</b>  THAT is the beauty and elegance of the solution offered by The Cornerstones of World Business—you can set up a company profile, which is at least 90% as effective as a dedicated website. However, instead of spending thousands of dollars and hundreds of man-hours, a corporate profile on CornerstonesWORLD.com takes under 10 minutes to set up and costs from just $10 per year. This allows our Members to channel their savings towards what really matters—developing their core business. WE expend the time and financial resources on advertising and promotion of all our Members so that they do not have to.<br/>

The Cornerstones of World
Business (CSW) is an international business directory, founded to support small

the front of the line, i.e. Members are listed at the top of the category,
before the alphabetically arranged free listings. Furthermore, Members enjoy
the following benefits:</span><p></p>

<span style=""color: rgb(255, 188, 61);"">Our history and motivation</span><br/>
</h2>
<p>We did not just wake up one morning and
decide to take on the world. No. In the late 90s we ran an advertising agency
for SMEs—trying to get them the most bang for their buck and place them into
the conventional media at low cost. We discovered that helping to promote small
businesses one at a time was neither scalable, nor sustainable. We cast about
online for a fair, community-based solution designed to support and help SMEs,
but found none. Sure, there were already many places one could splurge about
funds for attention, but no platform that sought to unite businesses under the
banner of keeping their funds in their pockets. We took up the challenge and in
2000 <b>The Cornerstones of Latvian
Business</b> was born with the aim of helping members create cost-effective
alternatives to corporate web pages. Fast-forward four years, as Latvia joined
the EU, we made the decision to expand our network internationally.</p>
<p>We tried conventional investment in 2006, but
in the end decided that no deal was better than a bad deal. Having suffered
nearly a year’s setback due to springboards and presentations, we have not been
keen to return to the ‘wishful-thinking well’ of traditional investor relations.
And so we have struggled to keep our dream alive, but at least we did not sell
out and let it become someone else’s dream.</p>
<p>We have no illusions that to truly become a <b>Global Chamber of Commerce</b>
and live up to its name, the project needs a much larger team and more powerful
infrastructure. However, we have decided to take it one step at a time and show
you, our investors, what we can achieve before seeking funds for the next stage
of expansion. Through crowdfunding we aim to shatter the paradigm of
conventional investment and create something of great value for you and the
business community as a whole.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1447175883/qexmgm3rut1wqvqcsybs.png"" src="""" style=""cursor: nw-resize;""/></p>
<h2><span style=""color: rgb(255, 188, 61);"">What we need your help for</span></h2>
<div>
<p>We would like to ask you to help support a fundraiser to relieve some of the costs that await us in the first two quarters of 2016. Over the past ten years we have made several large investments into the development and creation of the website you see before you today. However, quite a few challenges still lie ahead, hence, we decided to appeal to you, the business community, to help carry the cost for some of the features we are developing to serve you better. </p>
<p>At the moment we are a tiny team of four and a half people (part time contributors), juggling dozens of full time jobs—from social media and PR management to content creation, client relations, quality analysis, accounting, development and IT, research, client support, product testing and many other tasks. We need your help to develop and deliver a more complete user experience and a more effective promotional platform for the benefit of all SMEs.</p>
<div>
<p><b>Here is a look at aspects of
our seven-month budget, which would be greatly mitigated by the $42,400 target
of this fundraiser:</b></p>
<h4><b>Vital design and development target $13,500</b></h4>
<div>
<b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">1. New product development/programming</b><br/>
</div>
<p>We have several new
features planned that will grant even more control, while improving the reach
and effectiveness of the Member package we offer, without driving up the cost.
Top contributors will receive a project plan that details the game-changing
features under development.</p>
<p><b>2. Create a responsive design for mobile devices</b></p>
<p>The
infrastructure of the website has not been overhauled in several years. The
market share of mobile devices continues to grow exponentially, setting a clear
trend and we must move with the times. Several new templates must be created
for the website, to make it load quickly and work effectively on palm-held
devices. This compatibility is essential to remain competitive in today’s market
and conquer the Internet marketing arena, taking our Members to the pinnacle of
promotion.</p>
<p><b>3. Improve site search functionality</b></p>
<p>We aim to broaden the
searchable criteria and add localization filters to our query parameters. These
features will enable our visitors to narrow down their search results and pinpoint
<i>exactly</i> companies or business contacts
that interest them, greatly saving time and thereby enhancing their user
experience. From a media point of view, our aim remains to present visitors
with the BEST companies available in each country we cover.</p>
<p><b>4. Translation</b></p>
<p>To be effective on the global arena, we aim
to offer the website in ten languages, including German, Portuguese, Spanish,
French and Russian. This is a massive task, as we need to translate not only
the interface, but much of the content, as well.</p>
<h4>
<b>Database quality analyst team expansion: Target: $11,200 <span><br/></span></b><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">($1,600
per month)</span>
</h4>
<p>We would like to add two people
to our QA team and appeal to you to share the cost with us, by supporting this
goal with $800 per person per month (we will bridge the gap to complete the
salaries). These additional team members will allow us to better control the
flow of submissions to our website and help filter the database for quality and
safety, while testing and monitoring the directory and website functionality
for errors.</p>
<h4>
<b>Website promotion Target: $7,700 </b><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">($1,100 per month)</span>
</h4>
<p>Our aim is to minimize the
advertising budgets of SMEs. However, in order as to fulfill this mighty
mandate, we must spread our message far and wide. We need to mount a
substantial advertising campaign and amplify our presence. We cannot bring
about change if those we are trying to help are buried too deep under their
troubles to hear us or see our searchlight. We can only guide these floundering
ships to a safe harbor if we can reach out to them and guide them, so help us
build a light tower that can pierce the darkest clouds!</p>
<p>We need to advertise locally
and not only in Europe and North America, but in developing countries as well.
Obviously, a global campaign costs vastly more than the amount we have earmarked
for the first half of 2016. At this stage we aim to achieve a trickledown
effect that will push the costs of promotion even further down for developing
markets, as we target the most effective and stable economies.</p>
<p>We have slowly built The
Cornerstones of World Business to the tune of $15-20 thousand PER YEAR over the
past ten years. We always believed in the adage that “if we build it, they will
come”. But as it turns out: the lost need to be found, the clueless need clues
and the ignorant need information—in other words, <i>everyone needs an invitation</i>. You can help us get the word out—share
and promote this campaign and our press releases. To distribute one press
release properly via PRweb.com costs $369. We need to publish at least two releases
per month, be well publicized and have a strong presence in the media.</p>
<p><b>We will advertise on a large
scale to inform, attract and ultimately help millions of struggling SMEs.</b></p>

<p>There are, of course, many
additional running costs including rent, computers and other equipment,
software, salaries to mention but a few. These as always, we take upon
ourselves. If we exceed our goal, we shall expand our team with more members,
who will boost the content quality and outreach of the international business
directory. We will build new features such as a moderated business forum
through which SMEs will be able to contact captains of industry, pundits,
investors and leaders around the world. We will expand our testimonials, job
search, client rating and other features. In other words, we will sooner assume
our role as a Global Chamber of Commerce. So join Network Orange, vote for
business and support our cause to help SMEs succeed. </p>
<p>Even though our prices are already as low as can be by
North American or European standards, there are companies in the developing
world that cannot afford to promote themselves. Let's change the world
together! In ADDITION to your standard reward<b>, we pledge to upgrade 10 companies to Full Membership for a year, in a
developing country of your choice for every $150 you contribute.</b> The
hard-working entrepreneurs in developing countries also deserve their place in
the limelight and their share of fair trade. Let's rescue small business, by
boosting one company at a time!</p>
<p>We trust that you will enjoy
the perks we have lined up and look forward to rewarding your generosity and
possibly, working together with you in a joint effort to save the endangered
SMEs of the world from budget-stifling extinction!</p>

for small business owners and seems to be rigged against them. How can a seed
business grow into a flourishing, competitive company when the financial
hurdles are too high and the rungs too far apart? Apex creditors (investors)
and clients alike, demand testimonials, certificates and awards, before the
entrepreneur has gotten a foothold on the base of the mountain he or she must
climb to attain these accolades. All small entrepreneurs—regardless of whether
they produce handbags, rear livestock, offer HR services, bed and breakfast,
renovation or are engaged in something else entirely, are required to master
highly-technical skills. To survive, they must understand the intricacies of
SEO, be heavily engaged on social media and in general spend dozens of hours
and hundreds of dollars every month polishing their corporate image.


Wouldn’t it be nice if someone could take care of all that technological wizardry, so that they could concentrate on their core business? That is where The Cornerstones of World Business comes in. We aim to be the SMART SME’s
alternative to a costly website. Instead of spending thousands setting up
website and hundreds of hours per year monitoring SEO trends, managing,
promoting and maintaining a dedicated website, SMEs can set up a corporate
profile for a symbolic fee (less than the price of a Happy Meal) and enjoy most of the benefits that a well-optimized website would yield, saving hundreds of
hours and thousands of dollars.How do we understand the plight of SMEs so well? Because we ARE a small business. We have systematically built an impressive resource, endeavoring to create REAL value for other SMEs. We did this without any external investment and construction has taken us 10 years. We will now enter a phase of rapid expansion, uniting and strengthening thousands of SMEs under our banner. This is where YOU come in. You have the power to help us spread the word, provide assistance and hope to struggling entrepreneurs who, due to financial constraints, have always drawn the short straw in business.  You can make a difference and help
launch a truly global B2B Chamber of Commerce.
Vote for business, help ignite CornerstonesWORLD.com as a shiny beacon of hope, a light at the end of the tunnel and empower us to help millions of SMEs worldwide!
The problemIt is no secret that when starting up a small business or SME resources are usually scarce. SMEs are notoriously understaffed and short on technical knowledge, the acquisition of which further limits the time and funds they have to spend on their main business. Money and time are hard to come by and yet without investing in promotion of the company, how can it be expected to grow? Many SMEs resort to building their brand instead of developing their primary product or service. The Internet is a mighty tool and most SMEs begin by commissioning a website, as a platform to promote themselves. But that takes meticulous planning, investment in R&D and then more investment in maintenance and promotion, potentially adding up to thousands of dollars in the first months, when the company is most vulnerable to financial pressure. 
Would it not be nice  if all of the above could be taken care of by powerful professionals, leaving the entrepreneur to focus on his or her core business?  THAT is the beauty and elegance of the solution offered by The Cornerstones of World Business—you can set up a company profile, which is at least 90% as effective as a dedicated website. However, instead of spending thousands of dollars and hundreds of man-hours, a corporate profile on CornerstonesWORLD.com takes under 10 minutes to set up and costs from just $10 per year. This allows our Members to channel their savings towards what really matters—developing their core business. WE expend the time and financial resources on advertising and promotion of all our Members so that they do not have to.

About CSW
The Cornerstones of World
Business (CSW) is an international business directory, founded to support small
and medium-sized enterprises or SMEs. Our mission is to provide a fair and open
forum, a marketing platform where the voices of the smaller companies can be
heard above the din created by large companies elsewhere. We aim to provide
top-tier advertising opportunities to SMEs with micro budgets for advertising, who
cannot afford to spend over $1,000 per year, let alone per month.



By being more compact, faster,
cheaper, better optimized and easier to maintain, CSW aims to replace
cumbersome, conventional websites.
CSW offers quality advertising
packages for SMEs from $10/YEAR.

 Small businesses really appreciate affordable and effective marketing solutions.
  

What Memberships offer
Memberships are corporate
profiles dedicated to the promotion of a specific company. They are significantly different from the
address popups of free listings. To begin with, Memberships bump the company to
the front of the line, i.e. Members are listed at the top of the category,
before the alphabetically arranged free listings. Furthermore, Members enjoy
the following benefits:


Logo


Spam-secure
email form and Google-safe link to website


Description
text (in several languages)


Social
media links


Address with
map


Photo
gallery


Video


Service
icons


B2B
networking tools (company recommendation, service rating, etc.)


Mirrored
listing in a second category


All that and more comes at just
$10 per YEAR! Each Membership is a self-contained, self-sufficient website—as unique
as it is affordable.



The full benefits of Membership
can be found here: http://www.cornerstonesworld.com/benefits

Ultimately, CSW will become a
lively forum where SMEs can interact, exchange ideas, services and partner up,
driving their business forward, supporting one another and growing together.
CSW will become a global chamber of commerce, where every company, regardless
of size will have a fair chance to make a big splash and succeed.

Our history and motivation

We did not just wake up one morning and
decide to take on the world. No. In the late 90s we ran an advertising agency
for SMEs—trying to get them the most bang for their buck and place them into
the conventional media at low cost. We discovered that helping to promote small
businesses one at a time was neither scalable, nor sustainable. We cast about
online for a fair, community-based solution designed to support and help SMEs,
but found none. Sure, there were already many places one could splurge about
funds for attention, but no platform that sought to unite businesses under the
banner of keeping their funds in their pockets. We took up the challenge and in
2000 The Cornerstones of Latvian
Business was born with the aim of helping members create cost-effective
alternatives to corporate web pages. Fast-forward four years, as Latvia joined
the EU, we made the decision to expand our network internationally.
We tried conventional investment in 2006, but
in the end decided that no deal was better than a bad deal. Having suffered
nearly a year’s setback due to springboards and presentations, we have not been
keen to return to the ‘wishful-thinking well’ of traditional investor relations.
And so we have struggled to keep our dream alive, but at least we did not sell
out and let it become someone else’s dream.
We have no illusions that to truly become a Global Chamber of Commerce
and live up to its name, the project needs a much larger team and more powerful
infrastructure. However, we have decided to take it one step at a time and show
you, our investors, what we can achieve before seeking funds for the next stage
of expansion. Through crowdfunding we aim to shatter the paradigm of
conventional investment and create something of great value for you and the
business community as a whole.


What we need your help for

We would like to ask you to help support a fundraiser to relieve some of the costs that await us in the first two quarters of 2016. Over the past ten years we have made several large investments into the development and creation of the website you see before you today. However, quite a few challenges still lie ahead, hence, we decided to appeal to you, the business community, to help carry the cost for some of the features we are developing to serve you better. 
At the moment we are a tiny team of four and a half people (part time contributors), juggling dozens of full time jobs—from social media and PR management to content creation, client relations, quality analysis, accounting, development and IT, research, client support, product testing and many other tasks. We need your help to develop and deliver a more complete user experience and a more effective promotional platform for the benefit of all SMEs.

Here is a look at aspects of
our seven-month budget, which would be greatly mitigated by the $42,400 target
of this fundraiser:
Vital design and development target $13,500

1. New product development/programming

We have several new
features planned that will grant even more control, while improving the reach
and effectiveness of the Member package we offer, without driving up the cost.
Top contributors will receive a project plan that details the game-changing
features under development.
2. Create a responsive design for mobile devices
The
infrastructure of the website has not been overhauled in several years. The
market share of mobile devices continues to grow exponentially, setting a clear
trend and we must move with the times. Several new templates must be created
for the website, to make it load quickly and work effectively on palm-held
devices. This compatibility is essential to remain competitive in today’s market
and conquer the Internet marketing arena, taking our Members to the pinnacle of
promotion.
3. Improve site search functionality
We aim to broaden the
searchable criteria and add localization filters to our query parameters. These
features will enable our visitors to narrow down their search results and pinpoint
exactly companies or business contacts
that interest them, greatly saving time and thereby enhancing their user
experience. From a media point of view, our aim remains to present visitors
with the BEST companies available in each country we cover.
4. Translation
To be effective on the global arena, we aim
to offer the website in ten languages, including German, Portuguese, Spanish,
French and Russian. This is a massive task, as we need to translate not only
the interface, but much of the content, as well.

Database quality analyst team expansion: Target: $11,200 ($1,600
per month)

We would like to add two people
to our QA team and appeal to you to share the cost with us, by supporting this
goal with $800 per person per month (we will bridge the gap to complete the
salaries). These additional team members will allow us to better control the
flow of submissions to our website and help filter the database for quality and
safety, while testing and monitoring the directory and website functionality
for errors.

Website promotion Target: $7,700 ($1,100 per month)

Our aim is to minimize the
advertising budgets of SMEs. However, in order as to fulfill this mighty
mandate, we must spread our message far and wide. We need to mount a
substantial advertising campaign and amplify our presence. We cannot bring
about change if those we are trying to help are buried too deep under their
troubles to hear us or see our searchlight. We can only guide these floundering
ships to a safe harbor if we can reach out to them and guide them, so help us
build a light tower that can pierce the darkest clouds!
We need to advertise locally
and not only in Europe and North America, but in developing countries as well.
Obviously, a global campaign costs vastly more than the amount we have earmarked
for the first half of 2016. At this stage we aim to achieve a trickledown
effect that will push the costs of promotion even further down for developing
markets, as we target the most effective and stable economies.
We have slowly built The
Cornerstones of World Business to the tune of $15-20 thousand PER YEAR over the
past ten years. We always believed in the adage that “if we build it, they will
come”. But as it turns out: the lost need to be found, the clueless need clues
and the ignorant need information—in other words, everyone needs an invitation. You can help us get the word out—share
and promote this campaign and our press releases. To distribute one press
release properly via PRweb.com costs $369. We need to publish at least two releases
per month, be well publicized and have a strong presence in the media.
We will advertise on a large
scale to inform, attract and ultimately help millions of struggling SMEs.
Local dedicated server, mirrored hosting in Australia and North America:
$6,000



Server: $3,000
(shipping to Europe is not free)

installation, security reinforcement and software: $1,600


GoDaddy
installation and dedicated hosting: $1,400/year




Mitigate funding campaign running costs: $4,000



Indiegogo’s
stake


Physical
rewards



There are, of course, many
additional running costs including rent, computers and other equipment,
software, salaries to mention but a few. These as always, we take upon
ourselves. If we exceed our goal, we shall expand our team with more members,
who will boost the content quality and outreach of the international business
directory. We will build new features such as a moderated business forum
through which SMEs will be able to contact captains of industry, pundits,
investors and leaders around the world. We will expand our testimonials, job
search, client rating and other features. In other words, we will sooner assume
our role as a Global Chamber of Commerce. So join Network Orange, vote for
business and support our cause to help SMEs succeed. 
Even though our prices are already as low as can be by
North American or European standards, there are companies in the developing
world that cannot afford to promote themselves. Let's change the world
together! In ADDITION to your standard reward, we pledge to upgrade 10 companies to Full Membership for a year, in a
developing country of your choice for every $150 you contribute. The
hard-working entrepreneurs in developing countries also deserve their place in
the limelight and their share of fair trade. Let's rescue small business, by
boosting one company at a time!
We trust that you will enjoy
the perks we have lined up and look forward to rewarding your generosity and
possibly, working together with you in a joint effort to save the endangered
SMEs of the world from budget-stifling extinction!

<p>My name is Kristen Bailey and I am the proud owner of Sweets &amp; Meats LLC.  We are a licensed and insured caterer and mobile BBQ vendor.  We launched our business on 11/2/2014 after years of hosting backyard BBQ's in our home.  My partner Anton is a self taught cook, although he learned a few tips from his grandfather Joe in Alabama, where he has roots.

<p>For the past year, I along with my partner Anton, mother Michelle, and countless family members and friends who have donated their time and resources, have served up some of Cincinnati's best BBQ at festivals, food truck rallies, neighborhood events, fundraisers, breweries and private parties.

<p>Very sadly
he has a brain tumor. (see description below)</p>
<p>Unless he
gets the correct surgery right now he will die.</p>
<p>  Unfortunately 
Mongolia doesn't have the surgery equipment or the trained staff to do
the operation.</p>
<p>Therefore
his only hope is to have this life saving operation in another country, for
example Korea or China.</p>
<p>Sadly he needs
this operation now....within the next 5 days.</p>
<p>Mongolia is
a 3rd world country.  Its poverty level was estimated
at 29.8 percent of the population,  by

<p>Hasbilbeg is
the eldest son of a family of 5 children. 
He is 13 years old.</p>
<p>Like most  children in Mongolia he enjoys horse riding
and playing with his brothers and sisters.</p>
<p>Unfortunately
his father can't get much work , and what little work he does get just covers
food for the family.</p>
<p> His mother is busy looking after the family
and also has little chance of employment in Mongolia.</p>

he has been diagnosed with is angiofibroma.</p>

called juvenile nasopharyngeal  <b>angiofibroma</b>)
is a histological benign but locally aggressive vascular tumor that grows in
the back of the nasal cavity. It most commonly affects adolescent males ). </p>

Mongolia.</p>
<p>Normally he
is just a happy boy looking forward to school and time with his family.</p>
<p><b>Hasbilbeg needs your help now...</b></p>
<p>The
operation is urgent  now...otherwise he
will die.</p>
<p>It is true
there are many people in the world today with brain tumors but they have

Christmas.  Right now.(see his picture at end of this story)
His name is
Hasbilbeg and he lives in Mongolia.
Very sadly
he has a brain tumor. (see description below)
Unless he
gets the correct surgery right now he will die.
  Unfortunately 
Mongolia doesn't have the surgery equipment or the trained staff to do
the operation.
Therefore
his only hope is to have this life saving operation in another country, for
example Korea or China.
Sadly he needs
this operation now....within the next 5 days.
Mongolia is
a 3rd world country.  Its poverty level was estimated
at 29.8 percent of the population,  by
the World Bank in 2012.
His Story.
Hasbilbeg is
the eldest son of a family of 5 children. 
He is 13 years old.
Like most  children in Mongolia he enjoys horse riding
and playing with his brothers and sisters.
Unfortunately
his father can't get much work , and what little work he does get just covers
food for the family.
 His mother is busy looking after the family
and also has little chance of employment in Mongolia.
His problem
was diagnosed recently when he started having nose bleeds for no apparent
reason.
The disease
he has been diagnosed with is angiofibroma.
( Nasopharyngeal angiofibroma  (also
called juvenile nasopharyngeal  angiofibroma)
is a histological benign but locally aggressive vascular tumor that grows in
the back of the nasal cavity. It most commonly affects adolescent males ). 
 Only 3 other people have the disease in
Mongolia.
Normally he
is just a happy boy looking forward to school and time with his family.
Hasbilbeg needs your help now...
The
operation is urgent  now...otherwise he
will die.
It is true
there are many people in the world today with brain tumors but they have
family and friends and can have the operation done locally in their own country
and usually have the funds to cover it.
Hasbileg has
no one who can help him...except maybe you.
Can you help?
The amount required...to cover the
airfare, the operation and return airfare is US$20,055.20
...if 400
people donated US$50 the target would be achieved...or
...if 200
people donated US$100..again the target would be achieved...if 40 people gave US$500..again we would achive the goal...
Why should
we support this young boy....well I believe in western countries we are long
past covering our needs and are now looking for our wants to be covered.
We are extremely
well off in the western world...and now is an opportunity for us to help
someone in a 3rd world country with a small donation.
Please act
now....your donation, however small will really help.
It's
Christmas time...the time of giving
Who am I and why am I doing this?
My name is
David and during the last 11 years I have traveled to Mongolia 8 times with a

It will make

<p><b>ABOUT US </b></p>
<p>Dear
Friends, </p>
<p>Century Books of Pasadena opened its
doors on December 17, 2011 on beautiful Green Street, just two blocks away from
Caltech - one of the world’s top educational institutions.  For four years with the help and support of
our community the bookstore and art gallery became a small cultural
center.  From the wonderful books that
surround us to the art gallery and lecture hall, to the smallest Einstein
Museum in the world, we’ve been living our dream.  We have been curating our eclectic selection
of books for many years, and from the beginning we had talented local artists and
musicians, featuring and selling their artwork, and have great
performances.  In about two months after opening our
bookshop, we started to have live music on a weekly basis, live jazz every
Saturday night, enchanting classical concerts, and many special music events.  We host author events, we are a home for two
very lively book clubs, and many great lectures and discussions, on literature, <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">history,
science, many by famous scientists,  and lots of unique topics, i.e. ""The Train and the Cosmos: Visionary Modernity"" by Matilde Marcolli, Mathematical Physicist, or another personal
favorite....  “The history of chocolate”
(with tasting) by Dr. Lee Theissen, and great group discussions, and as a friend said it, scientists and artists, a unique mix, </span><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">can come together and exchange ideas in a completely

<p><b>But let me take you back in time for
a moment… </b></p>
<p><strong></strong></p><p><strong><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1451348988/oxqoi5isgehecplyzqbv.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 620px; height: 792px;""/></strong></p><strong>
<br/></strong><p></p>
<p>I’m Judith Marosvolgyi, the co-owner
of Century Books of Pasadena. When my
husband Steve and I first planned opening the bookshop, we started to curate
all the books, added our own library, worked extremely long hours, and with the
help of the nicest friends you can imagine –Isaac, Robert, whose support has been unbelievable, Gabor, Kathy, Marjie
– just to name a few, we were able to raise the money we needed.<span>  Steve drew this cartoon of the two of us, which is still my favorite.  Our first business plan started to read
like this: </span></p>
<p>“You know those places in Paris,
London, or New York, where you have a street lined with beautiful trees, in
effect a picturesque shady lane, filled with charming cafés and shops. It is a
place where you want to go and forget about time on a pleasant afternoon, to
leisurely walk the street, visiting all its nooks, and enjoying all it has to
offer.<span> </span></p>
<p>Well, our dream is to open a small
bookshop on a beautiful street in Pasadena.<span> 
This place has lush trees arching over the lane with charming little
restaurants and stores.  This city boasts
numerous historic buildings designed by world-renowned architects.  It is just a few blocks away where Albert
Einstein roamed the campus at Caltech in the 1930s, and it is a short walk to
the famous Pasadena Playhouse.  This is
where we would love to have a bookshop, a place where people can enjoy a fine
cup of coffee or some tea with delicious pastry and get lost in
some of their favorite books”.  </span></p>
<p><i>And
so it happened… our dream came true… </i></p>
<p>and we were so excited to start… it didn’t matter to us how much time and
energy it would take … we just loved every moment of it, and love it since… If you love to read, and love books, you know
that magic surrounds them.  </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src="""" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1451349377/jmcfkju2hpemo69lx7fl.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><br/></p><p>But we are also aware of the reality
of the business.  We are making
changes to our model to make sure that we’ll be able to sustain and become
profitable with the bookstore for many years to come.  In order to do that
one of the steps we made is that we are transforming the Art Gallery and the
The Relatively Small Einstein Museum into a non-profit organization.  This
way, in addition to all our existing special events, we'll be able to add many
new lectures, events, educational programs, including small group tours from
our Einstein Museum to the Einstein Papers Project and other parts of the
beautiful campus of Caltech, and it will not take resources away from the
bookstore.  In the meantime a group of professional friends of our bookstore,
generously offered their time and started to help us with business consulting
to help us turn the business around, which has been
invaluable.  </p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1451352521/jxcgkb2vhlmdttjumx4i.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><div><br/></div>
<p><b>WHAT
WE NEED AND WHAT WE HAVE TO OFFER… </b></p>
<p>Our lease is up, and the landlord(s)
who have been very patient and gracious to us throughout the years, will only
renew our lease if we are able to prove that we are a viable business and we
have six-months rent in reserve.<span>  In the
meantime we are also working on several very exciting new projects for the
store… And this is where we need your
help. It was under extraordinary
circumstances that we were able to lease this space on the first place, where
kind friends came and helped us start from nothing.  But this was the perfect place for all the
things that we have envisioned from the beginning, so we persevered.  Our close proximity to Caltech has been
invaluable to us.  Students, teachers,
and everyone have been a great support to our store.  If we would have to relocate, we might not be
able to have the unique lectures, which we and our community have been so
fortunate to participate in.  Also, in
the case of relocation, the cost of the move would be significantly higher, not
counting the loss of sales due to relocation and preparation of a new
space.  </span></p>
<p>So we ask for your help to make all
this possible… We are grateful for any contribution, so we put together the
perks with that in mind.<span>  This was
possible with the help of many generous artists, musicians, professors, businesses,
individuals, and we hope you’ll love our unique perks as much as we love to put it
together for you… </span></p>

all the books, added our own library, worked extremely long hours, and with the
help of the nicest friends you can imagine –Isaac, Robert, whose support has been unbelievable, Gabor, Kathy, Marjie
– just to name a few, we were able to raise the money we needed.  Steve drew this cartoon of the two of us, which is still my favorite.  Our first business plan started to read
like this: 
“You know those places in Paris,
London, or New York, where you have a street lined with beautiful trees, in
effect a picturesque shady lane, filled with charming cafés and shops. It is a
place where you want to go and forget about time on a pleasant afternoon, to
leisurely walk the street, visiting all its nooks, and enjoying all it has to
offer. 
Well, our dream is to open a small
bookshop on a beautiful street in Pasadena. 
This place has lush trees arching over the lane with charming little
restaurants and stores.  This city boasts
numerous historic buildings designed by world-renowned architects.  It is just a few blocks away where Albert
Einstein roamed the campus at Caltech in the 1930s, and it is a short walk to
the famous Pasadena Playhouse.  This is
where we would love to have a bookshop, a place where people can enjoy a fine
cup of coffee or some tea with delicious pastry and get lost in
some of their favorite books”.  
And
so it happened… our dream came true… 
and we were so excited to start… it didn’t matter to us how much time and
energy it would take … we just loved every moment of it, and love it since… If you love to read, and love books, you know
that magic surrounds them.  

But we are also aware of the reality
of the business.  We are making
changes to our model to make sure that we’ll be able to sustain and become
profitable with the bookstore for many years to come.  In order to do that
one of the steps we made is that we are transforming the Art Gallery and the
The Relatively Small Einstein Museum into a non-profit organization.  This
way, in addition to all our existing special events, we'll be able to add many
new lectures, events, educational programs, including small group tours from
our Einstein Museum to the Einstein Papers Project and other parts of the
beautiful campus of Caltech, and it will not take resources away from the
bookstore.  In the meantime a group of professional friends of our bookstore,
generously offered their time and started to help us with business consulting
to help us turn the business around, which has been
invaluable.  
WHAT
WE NEED AND WHAT WE HAVE TO OFFER… 
Our lease is up, and the landlord(s)
who have been very patient and gracious to us throughout the years, will only
renew our lease if we are able to prove that we are a viable business and we
have six-months rent in reserve.  In the
meantime we are also working on several very exciting new projects for the
store… And this is where we need your
help. It was under extraordinary
circumstances that we were able to lease this space on the first place, where
kind friends came and helped us start from nothing.  But this was the perfect place for all the
things that we have envisioned from the beginning, so we persevered.  Our close proximity to Caltech has been
invaluable to us.  Students, teachers,
and everyone have been a great support to our store.  If we would have to relocate, we might not be
able to have the unique lectures, which we and our community have been so
fortunate to participate in.  Also, in
the case of relocation, the cost of the move would be significantly higher, not
counting the loss of sales due to relocation and preparation of a new
space.  
So we ask for your help to make all
this possible… We are grateful for any contribution, so we put together the
perks with that in mind.  This was
possible with the help of many generous artists, musicians, professors, businesses,
individuals, and we hope you’ll love our unique perks as much as we love to put it
together for you…

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hi, I am Kalisha Abercrombie Tucker, early childhood educator, wife, mother of many, nana of numerous littles, hat wearer extraordinaire, and founder of the <strong>DROP ZONE</strong>. My passion and love for children, concern for families, and a strong sense of community is what drives me.</p>
<p>Recognizing families as the cornerstone of every community while vividly recalling the lack of support while raising my own children, I have yearned for an opportunity to provide for parents what I so desperately wished I had - peace of mind and extraordinary childcare. This is what every parent wants and needs while their children are in the care of another.</p>
<p>I have met and watched hundreds of parents struggle to properly care for their children while simultaneously trying to fulfill numerous daily obligations. How many times have you witnessed the frustration and stress of a parent in a supermarket, at the doctor’s, or a restaurant vacillating between the task at hand while caring for the children?</p>
<p>To that end, I felt compelled to create a dependable, easily accessible drop in childcare option that addressed the shortcomings of traditional childcare centers--serving the unique needs of families in my community--which is exactly what ""Ms. Kalisha"" was born to do!  </p>
<p>So, in 2017, after researching non-traditional and part time childcare options in the greater Fayetteville area and finding only two in my immediate area, I decided to embark on opening a short-term childcare center for parents in need of childcare while they run errands, attend an appointment, enjoy a date night, or simply unwind and relax for a few.</p>
<p>The <strong>DROP ZONE</strong> will be centrally located in the heart of Fayetteville. We will offer hourly short-term childcare, before and after school care, workday and summer camps, special activities, and classes for children 6 weeks to 12 years old. Certified, licensed and experienced providers, visually stimulating and inviting environment, cognitively creative activities, and cutting-edge equipment are just some of the characteristics that differentiate our facility from any other. <strong>What better way to help parents lighten the load, than dropping their little ones off at The DROP ZONE?</strong> Parents manage their day, while we manage their children in a fun, safe, caring and engaging environment! </p>
<p>The <strong>DROP ZONE</strong> is perfect when needing exceptional childcare:</p>
<ul>
<li>In a pinch</li>
<li>To go shopping</li>
<li>To run an errand</li>
<li>To enjoy a date night</li>
<li>To go on a job interview</li>
<li>To go to an aerobics class</li>
<li>To enjoy lunch with your friends</li>
<li>To go to a nail or doctor's appointment </li>
<li>Or to just wind down and relax for an afternoon</li>
</ul>

<h3>Just Exactly Who Is Mrs. Kalisha</h3>
<p>The lady who's passion and call in life is to nurture children and families. I hold an associate degree (HNR) in Early Childhood Education, have earned Infant Toddler Care, Child Care Development, Child Care Professional, and Child Care Administration certifications. My career working with children spans more than 30 years, and my experience includes preschool teacher, Child and Adult Care Food Program/Summer Food Service Program administrator, elementary/middle school substitute, after school program coordinator, summer camp counselor, group home administrator, child care center administrator, and change agent for children. My life's greatest joy is my eight awesome adult children, and my twelve phenomenal grand babies. Your contribution will fulfill a lifelong dream of owning my own childcare facility and allow me an opportunity to partner with community parents to assist them with caring for their children -- <i>because it truly takes a village.</i> </p>

What We Need & What You Get

We're looking to generate $80,000.00 to facilitate the following activities:

$30k will be used to fund 3 separate business owners and their ideas.
$50k will be used to purchase property in the Detroit area and to help facilitate revitalization in the community.
In the event these goals aren't reached completely, the funds will still be distributed between helping others own businesses and retrieving new property to offer up owner ship to partners.


The Impact
CEO is just what The Detroit Community needs.

This plan pulls together several elements that will help move the community forward. Individuals to participate in the CEO movement immediately becomes an owner of the property and businesses purchased by CEO.
Our team is surprised of a variety of resourceful individuals who well help make this project a huge success.


Risks & Challenges
The landscape in Detroit currently provides several opportunities to purchase properties and offers an extensive amount of intelligent aspiring business owners.

There's only a few risk that challenge us right now including the due diligence and consistent pursuit needed to find and secure properties.
And with the complex nature of our endeavors, our ability to accurately describe what it is were attempting to do.

<h3><strong>Who are we?</strong></h3>
<p>We are David Daniel and Gavin Facey, two Newport born colleagues and friends that you might have met behind the bar at the Westgate over the last year and a bit. David is also the director of The Escape Rooms Newport, another successful business that the people of Newport helped to get off the ground with a crowdfunder, a business that is now expanding and taking on more employees, while Gavin has worked in events management for years. Both of us were key organisers of events at Newport Rising Festival, the outstanding New Years Eve celebrations and more recently the very successful Art of Lockdown exhibition, all at the Westgate Hotel. In addition to our management team we’re partnered with the landlord and their team of representatives, who share our vision and are offering financial and practical support.</p>
<p>We’ve had the privilege of working at the Westgate Hotel for just over a year after gaining the permission of the owner to begin the clean up process and worked alongside the amazing volunteers from Our Chartist Heritage to turn a building that had been largely abandoned for 15 years from a dark, dirty and neglected ex-hotel into a bright, vibrant events venue in the city centre with so much potential. <strong>We love this building</strong>; the history it contains, what it stands for and what it could be and we’re dedicated to our mission to revitalise it and open it up to the public again, permanently.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1599301746/ftpesaiozqjri0wlyzad.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p><strong>Why now?</strong></p>
<p>Recently and in previous years the Westgate Hotel has been broken into and damaged. A recent break in during lockdown resulted in further damage to the beautiful ballroom roof as thieves tried to smash their way through a floor to access other parts of the building. We cannot allow this iconic building to be damaged further or worse destroyed and must work to preserve it for today and for future generations. We think the best way to secure the building is to have people in it, using it and looking after it with upgraded CCTV, alarms systems and physical barriers. We do not accept the narrative that the Westgate or Newport’s city Centre should be condemned to continued decline; despite a series of blows including the recent coronavirus pandemic <strong>we believe that better is possible</strong>. This project is designed to be forward looking and a long term investment in Newport's future; coronavirus is not here to stay and we intend to rise to the challenge and be ready to launch in 2021.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1599302404/b3rmtkzujtw2q34zbuzl.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>We feel that the project at the Westgate has reached a crucial point, at which the venue could return to dereliction, suffer further break-ins or damage and be boarded up once more or, we can create something really special and unique in the city centre that includes and respects the heritage of the building while also looking to the future, providing bar, cafe, WiFi and flexible spaces for a range of uses and a new addition to the events and live music scene. We’re speaking to architects and conservation officers so that we can remove the ugly security hoarding on the grand main entrance and reinstall period appropriate front doors ready to welcome people once more. But that’s just the start...</p>
<p><strong>We intend to;</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Reopen the lower ballroom off Stow Hill to create a busy events venue, hosting music, arts, performance and heritage </li>
<li>Reopen the 1st floor gallery as a mixed use cafe/bar with exhibition space, flexible working and business facilities, networking and small conference plus community hires</li>
<li>Reinvest in the building, improving the facilities and repairing historic damages and securing against break ins and malicious theft and safeguard for future generations</li>
<li>Bring new areas of the venue into use with potential use as small studios, meeting rooms, community hires and rehearsal rooms</li>
<li>Lay the groundwork for future redevelopment of the building so that the Westgate can be full of life from top to bottom once more.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Our convictions are based on more than just optimism</strong>; with our partners Newport Rising and others we’ve tested a variety of cultural, heritage and entertainment events, attracting over 2500 visitors to the venue in just two weeks for a graphic novel launch in June 2019, followed by a vibrant festival in November, multiple music and film events and the hugely successful New Years Eve celebration that raised thousands for charity and brought hundreds of visitors to the city centre through December to February 2020 before lockdown. Public interest was not deterred by the still present coronavirus and once restrictions were relaxed we held a highly successful art exhibition attracting over 600 visitors of all ages in two weeks of August this year.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1599303895/yasbf6jlea9mt86l3mul.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Our Chartist Heritage has done so much to lay the foundations, we’re going to continue their efforts and <strong>guarantee a permanent position for them</strong> to continue to do their great work telling the Chartist story at the Westgate and adding new features for the 21st Century.</p>
<p>We've chosen to use crowdfunding so that we can deliver the project sooner and to a higher standard enabling us to achieve more on top of the money and time we will be investing ourselves. </p>
<p>Through our many conversations with visitors to the Westgate we also know that lots of people have strong connections and memories of the venue and might like to be a part of a project to bring it back to use and protect it. <strong>You can be a part of this project</strong>; your support is absolutely essential and we hope to see you at the Westgate very soon to thank you. Working together we can protect this historic and still beautiful building and create something new and inspiring for everyone in Newport's City Centre.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>There's lots of work to be done at the Westgate but <strong>every penny raised will go back into the building. </strong>We're not asking for a handout though, if you back us you get rewarded not just with the great perks but you'll get the satisfaction of making a big difference to Newport's City Centre at a time when the city needs us the most. Every time we open the Westgate, visitors tell us how they remember when it was the place to be in Newport; so many people have had their weddings at the venue, remember dancing in the ballroom and much more. For younger generations the Westgate has always been boarded up and closed. Let's work together to change that, to <strong>open the building up for everyone and protect it for the future.</strong></p>
<p>Money raised will go towards architects fees, specialist conservation work required throughout the building, upgrading and improving facilities throughout and essential safety work.</p>
<p>We've set a goal of £10,000 which is only a fraction of what is required for the entire project but will get us off to a much better start. If we don't hit the target then some areas will be delayed and compromises made, but will still all go back into the building.  If we exceed the target then we'll continue to put everything back into the project, delivering more and to a higher standard.</p>
</div><div> </div><div>
<p>Let's stick one in the eye of the naysayers and together create something that we can be proud of, will bring visitors to the city and shine a light on the best that Newport has to offer.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>In the short term, the coronavirus pandemic is undoubtedly a risk which we are fully aware of.  But we believe that a second wave will at most delay the project, not prevent it. Coronavirus isn't here forever and one thing the Westgate has is space - it's very possible to host people safely throughout the building which is something we're grateful for. We're also very lucky to have a great relationship with the landlord who understands our vision and wants to work with us to achieve it - this means we have some flexibility and ability to respond to challenges.</p>
<p>We've also got a great team of partners and supporters that share our vision and are ready to support in a number of ways, including;</p>

We are David Daniel and Gavin Facey, two Newport born colleagues and friends that you might have met behind the bar at the Westgate over the last year and a bit. David is also the director of The Escape Rooms Newport, another successful business that the people of Newport helped to get off the ground with a crowdfunder, a business that is now expanding and taking on more employees, while Gavin has worked in events management for years. Both of us were key organisers of events at Newport Rising Festival, the outstanding New Years Eve celebrations and more recently the very successful Art of Lockdown exhibition, all at the Westgate Hotel. In addition to our management team we’re partnered with the landlord and their team of representatives, who share our vision and are offering financial and practical support.
We’ve had the privilege of working at the Westgate Hotel for just over a year after gaining the permission of the owner to begin the clean up process and worked alongside the amazing volunteers from Our Chartist Heritage to turn a building that had been largely abandoned for 15 years from a dark, dirty and neglected ex-hotel into a bright, vibrant events venue in the city centre with so much potential. We love this building; the history it contains, what it stands for and what it could be and we’re dedicated to our mission to revitalise it and open it up to the public again, permanently.

Why now?
Recently and in previous years the Westgate Hotel has been broken into and damaged. A recent break in during lockdown resulted in further damage to the beautiful ballroom roof as thieves tried to smash their way through a floor to access other parts of the building. We cannot allow this iconic building to be damaged further or worse destroyed and must work to preserve it for today and for future generations. We think the best way to secure the building is to have people in it, using it and looking after it with upgraded CCTV, alarms systems and physical barriers. We do not accept the narrative that the Westgate or Newport’s city Centre should be condemned to continued decline; despite a series of blows including the recent coronavirus pandemic we believe that better is possible. This project is designed to be forward looking and a long term investment in Newport's future; coronavirus is not here to stay and we intend to rise to the challenge and be ready to launch in 2021.

We feel that the project at the Westgate has reached a crucial point, at which the venue could return to dereliction, suffer further break-ins or damage and be boarded up once more or, we can create something really special and unique in the city centre that includes and respects the heritage of the building while also looking to the future, providing bar, cafe, WiFi and flexible spaces for a range of uses and a new addition to the events and live music scene. We’re speaking to architects and conservation officers so that we can remove the ugly security hoarding on the grand main entrance and reinstall period appropriate front doors ready to welcome people once more. But that’s just the start...
We intend to;

Reopen the lower ballroom off Stow Hill to create a busy events venue, hosting music, arts, performance and heritage 
Reopen the 1st floor gallery as a mixed use cafe/bar with exhibition space, flexible working and business facilities, networking and small conference plus community hires
Reinvest in the building, improving the facilities and repairing historic damages and securing against break ins and malicious theft and safeguard for future generations
Bring new areas of the venue into use with potential use as small studios, meeting rooms, community hires and rehearsal rooms
Lay the groundwork for future redevelopment of the building so that the Westgate can be full of life from top to bottom once more.

Our convictions are based on more than just optimism; with our partners Newport Rising and others we’ve tested a variety of cultural, heritage and entertainment events, attracting over 2500 visitors to the venue in just two weeks for a graphic novel launch in June 2019, followed by a vibrant festival in November, multiple music and film events and the hugely successful New Years Eve celebration that raised thousands for charity and brought hundreds of visitors to the city centre through December to February 2020 before lockdown. Public interest was not deterred by the still present coronavirus and once restrictions were relaxed we held a highly successful art exhibition attracting over 600 visitors of all ages in two weeks of August this year.

Our Chartist Heritage has done so much to lay the foundations, we’re going to continue their efforts and guarantee a permanent position for them to continue to do their great work telling the Chartist story at the Westgate and adding new features for the 21st Century.
We've chosen to use crowdfunding so that we can deliver the project sooner and to a higher standard enabling us to achieve more on top of the money and time we will be investing ourselves. 
Through our many conversations with visitors to the Westgate we also know that lots of people have strong connections and memories of the venue and might like to be a part of a project to bring it back to use and protect it. You can be a part of this project; your support is absolutely essential and we hope to see you at the Westgate very soon to thank you. Working together we can protect this historic and still beautiful building and create something new and inspiring for everyone in Newport's City Centre.
 
What We Need & What You Get
There's lots of work to be done at the Westgate but every penny raised will go back into the building. We're not asking for a handout though, if you back us you get rewarded not just with the great perks but you'll get the satisfaction of making a big difference to Newport's City Centre at a time when the city needs us the most. Every time we open the Westgate, visitors tell us how they remember when it was the place to be in Newport; so many people have had their weddings at the venue, remember dancing in the ballroom and much more. For younger generations the Westgate has always been boarded up and closed. Let's work together to change that, to open the building up for everyone and protect it for the future.
Money raised will go towards architects fees, specialist conservation work required throughout the building, upgrading and improving facilities throughout and essential safety work.
We've set a goal of £10,000 which is only a fraction of what is required for the entire project but will get us off to a much better start. If we don't hit the target then some areas will be delayed and compromises made, but will still all go back into the building.  If we exceed the target then we'll continue to put everything back into the project, delivering more and to a higher standard.
 
Let's stick one in the eye of the naysayers and together create something that we can be proud of, will bring visitors to the city and shine a light on the best that Newport has to offer.
 

Risks & Challenges
 
In the short term, the coronavirus pandemic is undoubtedly a risk which we are fully aware of.  But we believe that a second wave will at most delay the project, not prevent it. Coronavirus isn't here forever and one thing the Westgate has is space - it's very possible to host people safely throughout the building which is something we're grateful for. We're also very lucky to have a great relationship with the landlord who understands our vision and wants to work with us to achieve it - this means we have some flexibility and ability to respond to challenges.
We've also got a great team of partners and supporters that share our vision and are ready to support in a number of ways, including;
Ringmaster Sports
Newport Rising / Our Chartist Heritage
Inspired Business Media
Tactile Bosch
Record One

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Desired Collective Spas started when LaToia Glatt opened Desired Esthetics at the end of 2018. Her dream to connect with you and bring you clean beauty products to achieve the skin of your dreams was being realized!</p>
<p>In 2019, after life threw her a curveball, Jimi Morrison found herself unemployed and against a wall. Understanding her situation and having known Jimi for several years, LaToia invited Jimi to bring Skin Body Sugar into Desired Esthetics. Jimi's passionate about offering holistic pain management services that help you get your life back. Most clients enjoy Jimi's slow, heavy pressure and look forward to enjoying Ashiatsu upon certification in 2021! On top of this, Jimi is also passionate about clean beauty services, including sugaring hair removal, and pole dance fitness!</p>
<p>Shortly after LaToia invited Sam Mills to bring The Body Mechanic in and complete the Desired Collective Spas. Sam Mills works with athletes to increase performance, decrease fatigue, prevent injury, and restore mobility. Now, he'd like to bring these services to you!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need $60,000.00 to assist us with expansion costs including construction and new equipment. We really want to make the new space incredibly special, inviting, and beautiful so that you truly feel like you are in a safe and welcoming environment.</p>
<p>We're offering spa services at discounts for your help!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>What we have learned in the past 8 years as service providers is that people need spas. Not only to relax but to feel loved, cared for, and treated kindly in an inspiring atmosphere. Desired Collective Spas truly works from the heart and combines knowledge of the services it provides with great customer care. After the pandemic caused the forced closure of personal care businesses, we weren’t certain we would survive the hit. But we’re still here offering you the wellness experience you have come to expect, enjoy, and quite frankly deserve!</p>
<p>We genuinely believe that if the spa were in a more accessible location with more space to increase services offered it would grow even further. We will always maintain a very boutique style space to ensure individual care, but a larger space would ensure that more services can be offered to clients and it will allow for pole fitness classes to be added.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>We have no fear of the success of a new location, however, there are still some challenges in finding it. We have some very precise desires for the new location. We would like the space to stay in the North or East Chattanooga area to cater to its current clientele. We are also looking for a space with sufficient free parking as well as wheelchair accessibility. Lastly, we need a space that is large enough to include a fitness area but is also affordable. We are constantly looking for all options whether that be to buy a place or lease. And we know the perfect spot is just around the corner. The contributions from clientele and supporters will really help widen the possibilities so that we can move more quickly and efficiently. </p>

<h3>Reserve</h3>
<p>We're Mike and Mike from VinoWine. We're two military vets turned entrepreneur who have been heavily involved in the Virginia wine industry since 2013.

Our tasting room will feature our wines along with a collection of other great wines from all across Virginia that will rotate each month. We'll also be serving a selection of local breads, cheeses and charcuterie boards.</p>
<p>We've already found the perfect space for our tasting room so now our main objective is to raise the funds needed to do some small renovations and purchase some needed items. Our goal is to be up and running by late Summer 2019.</p>
<p>We invite you to watch our video, look over our campaign, and check out the variety of Perks we're giving away. You can buy as many Perks as you like and we'd be honored if you donated to our campaign or shared our link via social media. Thank you!</p>

<h3>The Space</h3>
<p>We're located at 1101 Jefferson St in downtown Lynchburg, Virginia. The space that we're moving into used to be a coffee shop so our main focus is to renovate it and make it our own. We're in the design phase now but the renovations will closely follow.</p>
<p>We're going for a rustic/industrial look so we'll repaint the walls, rip out all the tin, and really play-up the old brick, exposed pipes, and all the duct-work. We're incredibly fortunate to have a space with ""old bones"" that was built into a rocky bluff outcropping, so we'll be highlighting these features giving the tasting room the character and look we're going for.</p>
<p>Some other features we'll be adding to the tasting room to make it really standout will be small chandeliers, comfortable couches, and a fireplace for customers to sip wine next to.</p>

However, what really separates us from the majority of tasting rooms throughout Virginia and the rest of the country is our diverse tasting menu. In addition to pouring our own vintages, we'll also be featuring other great wines that are made in Virginia by other wineries, which will rotate on and off our tasting menu each month. In doing this, we give our customers a unique tasting experience each time they visit, giving them the ability to taste some of the best wines made in Virginia, all under one roof.</p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>No great undertaking is without its risks and challenges. The biggest risk we can think of is that there may not be a large enough market for wine in the Lynchburg area. But, so far, we've been incredibly blessed with word that Reserve is the talk of Lynchburg. It's gotten back to us several times how excited everyone is to have their first tasting room and lounge in the downtown area and we hope that this excitement, combined with our great location, will help make Reserve the huge success we hope it to be. </p>
<p>Since the two of us are former infantrymen in the Army and Marines we're no strangers to plans going awry, no matter how well they're thought out in advance. However, two of our greatest strengths are performing under pressure and adjusting as needed. We're confident that with our hard work and your contributions, Reserve will be a huge success in Lynchburg!</p>
<p>In the end, no matter how much money we raise in this campaign, (even if it's less than our $50k goal) all the funds will still go towards the needed materials that will help put the finishing touches on our tasting room space. They'll be used for renovation expenses and to help us purchase all the furniture, glassware, lightening, equipment, machinery, etc. In the end, anything that's donated will be put to good use and will be greatly appreciated :)  </p>

<p>Anu Hall has 13 years of experience in working with people with disabilities. She is leading foundation Hea Hoog, which connects people with disabilities to job providers who are looking to hire. It’s still difficult, as at first, people are afraid to hire people who are different. Society is afraid of unknown and therefore they are afraid of us.</p>
<p>Just connecting job providers with our people is not enough. We need to take them back to the community, we want them to be part of our daily lives. Having a job is something that makes them happy, gives them energy and purpose. We want to give them all that by creating a cafe which specializes in educating our society in that topic.</p>
<p>In order to start with the cafe we need to collect 150 000 euros. We need to rent a place that is accessible in every way. This takes a lot of work and renovations – the entrance, accessibility, the toilets. In the perfect world even the kitchen has to be roomy enough to be accessible by wheelchair. We also need to provide special training and support. </p>
<p>By being part of our project, you help us create so much more job opportunities and make people happy and healthy! We aren’t only creating jobs in that one cafe – we are breaking the prejudice of society and providing work opportunities in other fields as well. Let’s make disability an ability!</p>
<p><br/>In case we can’t reach 150 000 euros with that campaign, we can start in different conditions. We can still provide job opportunities for some people, but without the right tools and environment we still have limitations and can’t provide opportunities to such a wide range of people.</p>
<p>We understand, that this topic is still a taboo and not too many people get excited by the idea, but if you understand what we want to achieve then you can help us out by spreading the word. If more people understand that people with disabilities are part of our society and they are more than happy to have a steady job themselves then we are already closer to achieving our goals and providing them with the jobs.</p>
<p>Please help us break the taboos of society and provide jobs to our hardworking people. You can help by donating and sharing the message. Thank you for being part of the campaign!</p>

Kizzy’s Books &amp; More is named after the character Kizzy from the book <i>Roots </i>by Alex Haley. Kizzy’s Books &amp; More is an independent bookstore that sells African-American literature and other products that embrace their culture. The intended location for Kizzy’s Books &amp; More is in the Parramore neighborhood in west-central Orlando, FL.  The Parramore neighborhood is a historic community that is currently being revitalized. This community is in need of a bookstore that meets the needs of African-American consumers. The consumers in Parramore and the surrounding areas need a place that sells a wide range of African-American literature and products. There are places in surrounding areas that sell African-American Literature. However, the amount of African-American literature being sold at these stores is very limited and often times not accessible. Kizzy’s Books &amp; More plans to fill that void.</p><p> Kizzy’s Books &amp; More is different from any other African American bookstore. What sets us apart from other African American bookstores is how we engage and connect with our customer base both online and at the store.

<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">I have been skateboarding for about 37 years (since 1977) and have watched skating go through so many changes. I have experienced, and learned so much through the simple act of just rolling on a board with 4 wheels attached to it. I now feel it is time to give back. My lifelong dream since I began skating has been to own my own company, and stoke other skaters as much as I was stoked by companies like Powell/Peralta, Dogtown, Girl/Chocolate, H-Street, and so many others who lived, and breathed skateboarding. I'm not here to ""Just make a dollar"" (money always helps obviously). I just want to repay skateboarding for everything it has given me, and I want to support and stoke the new generation. With Early Grab I seek to represent skating at a grass roots/DIY level, and keep it in the hands of the participants, not corporate interests. Early Grab is for skateboarders, all of you. My goal is to sell affordable (not ""cheap"") boards, clothing, and accessories that I would ride, and wear myself. This is my contribution to skateboarding. </span></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">The money contributed to this campaign will fund my first run of product (Boards, T-shirts, hoodies, headwear, and promo items i.e. stickers) , and help with operating costs (yes, I am looking for riders to sponsor too) I already have several shops lined up, and will also sell online via an Early Grab webstore.

</div></div>","Short Summary Hello, my name is Jamison Sinclair. I am 43, I was born in California, and have been a skateboarder my whole life. 
I have been skateboarding for about 37 years (since 1977) and have watched skating go through so many changes. I have experienced, and learned so much through the simple act of just rolling on a board with 4 wheels attached to it. I now feel it is time to give back. My lifelong dream since I began skating has been to own my own company, and stoke other skaters as much as I was stoked by companies like Powell/Peralta, Dogtown, Girl/Chocolate, H-Street, and so many others who lived, and breathed skateboarding. I'm not here to ""Just make a dollar"" (money always helps obviously). I just want to repay skateboarding for everything it has given me, and I want to support and stoke the new generation. With Early Grab I seek to represent skating at a grass roots/DIY level, and keep it in the hands of the participants, not corporate interests. Early Grab is for skateboarders, all of you. My goal is to sell affordable (not ""cheap"") boards, clothing, and accessories that I would ride, and wear myself. This is my contribution to skateboarding. 
The money contributed to this campaign will fund my first run of product (Boards, T-shirts, hoodies, headwear, and promo items i.e. stickers) , and help with operating costs (yes, I am looking for riders to sponsor too) I already have several shops lined up, and will also sell online via an Early Grab webstore. I have done an initial run, and the feedback was very positive. I am fully dedicated to Early Grab, and skateboarding, and hope I can stoke others the same way I was 37 years ago.

<h3><b>What's the Story?</b></h3>
<p></p>
<p>I’m so excited about creating a new, totally
independent place for people to explore books and artisans' creations in the scenic <b>Pikes Peak Region</b> <b>of Colorado</b>!</p>
<p><b>Beyond Words Books and Things </b>will carry inspirational books
that create good spirits and <b>support strong family values,</b> also specializing in
out of print, or off market books. 
E-books are great, but there’s a place in most people’s hearts for <b>real
books</b> – books that are familiar and beloved. 
In today’s world of rough language and tough topics, <b>Beyond Words</b>’ books
will be uplifting and energizing!  </p>
<p><b>Beyond Words Books and Things</b> will also be a place where
people can sell their arts and crafts in a family-friendly, faith oriented
store.  It will be <b>a bookstore</b>, but just
as much, it will be <b>an artisans’ outlet</b>. 
I always wanted a place to sell my own creations – jewelry, woodwork,
and handmade cards – but finding a supportive, year-round outlet is virtually
impossible. <b>Beyond Words Books and Things</b> will be that kind of place! <br/></p>
<p>For shoppers interested in superior quality art and merchandise as well as faith and family friendly materials, I will carry a myriad of Christian resources  such as books, <b>artwork, gifts, home decor, and clothing</b>. I'm also thrilled to welcome <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/pages/Ray-Shaw-Wildlife-Artist/209122015779238"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Colorado Wildlife Artist, Ray Shaw, </a><a href=""https://www.facebook.com/pages/Ray-Shaw-Wildlife-Artist/209122015779238"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""> </a>and <a href=""http://berryfarmstudios.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Laurie and Scott Longberry of Berry Farms Studios</a> in this endeavor.  And this is only a beginning!</p>

I’m so excited about creating a new, totally
independent place for people to explore books and artisans' creations in the scenic Pikes Peak Region of Colorado!
Beyond Words Books and Things will carry inspirational books
that create good spirits and support strong family values, also specializing in
out of print, or off market books. 
E-books are great, but there’s a place in most people’s hearts for real
books – books that are familiar and beloved. 
In today’s world of rough language and tough topics, Beyond Words’ books
will be uplifting and energizing!  
Beyond Words Books and Things will also be a place where
people can sell their arts and crafts in a family-friendly, faith oriented
store.  It will be a bookstore, but just
as much, it will be an artisans’ outlet. 
I always wanted a place to sell my own creations – jewelry, woodwork,
and handmade cards – but finding a supportive, year-round outlet is virtually
impossible. Beyond Words Books and Things will be that kind of place! 
For shoppers interested in superior quality art and merchandise as well as faith and family friendly materials, I will carry a myriad of Christian resources  such as books, artwork, gifts, home decor, and clothing. I'm also thrilled to welcome Colorado Wildlife Artist, Ray Shaw,  and Laurie and Scott Longberry of Berry Farms Studios in this endeavor.  And this is only a beginning!
What we need:
  It's a startup, so we need almost everything:  A space!  I have located several retail spaces for lease and need at least 3 months rent. Your help will determine which location we get in the busy spots or in the quiet spots.  We want busy! Computerized point of sale and security equipment - installed.
Shelving and furniture, lighting and cabinets Signs and miscellaneous supplies 

And what you get:
Fun Perks!
Bookmarks

void in the Pikes Peak Region for personalized outlets like the one I want to
build.  There are plenty of big name
bookstores, but which offer no place for local artisans.  There are consignment stores, flea markets,
and annual crafters shows, but those feature random collections of items that
don’t meet the needs of a faith-based clientele who want specific
materials.

studied his very successful model, and know I can build on that model to open
new doors for many people. Beyond Words Books and
Things will support artisans and authors to make creating all the more rewarding!     
What are the Challenges?
I'm so sure that this is a viable project that I'm willing to do whatever it takes to make things happen.  I've done all the preliminary set up that I can do without money.  And now it's down to the money!  But I realize that there are no sure things in business, so I've chosen an all or nothing campaign to start my bookstore - crafters' outlet.  I don't think it's fair to take generous help from anyone if I can't deliver the goods!

</p><p><b>Our Campaign:</b></p>
<p>Hello, my name is Anthony. Most of us can remember that
one toy we had growing up that meant more to us than any other. The toy that we
could spend an entire day playing with. For me that toy was my Team America
Super Stunt Dirt Bike. This campaign is to raise funding for a re-engineered
21st century version of this toy.<br/>
<br/>
Whether you remember playing with
this iconic toy as the great Evel Knievel, or as the re-branded version of Team
America “Super Stunt Dirt Bike,” you my friend are very fortunate to have
played with one of the bestselling toys the Ideal toy company ever made. 
If you share these memories, it also means that you grew up with one foot in
the 70’s and one in the 80’s. Arguably one of the best time to have been a
kid. <br/>
<br/>
If you are anything like me, you have a very special place in your heart for
this toy. Even though I could never get my toy to go like it did in the
commercials, I lost hours of my summer going on back yard adventures with my
Team America set... complete with the Black Marauder on his Super Stunt
Chopper. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, when the video game
industry boomed we kids found ourselves outside less and less and as a result
sale’s of this awesome toy (and many others) fell.</p>
<p>I was so excited to see the
re-release of this toy a few years back. I had big dreams of enjoying it with
my kids. But, we were all sadly disappointed to find that the new version was
low quality and didn’t hold up.</p>
<p><br/>
That’s why I’m here. My friend Vince (aka the 7-inch Dare-Devil) and I have
teamed up to launch an awesome re-engineered modern version of this toy, while
maintaining the integrity and the fun of the original design. We’ve designed a
new launcher and the bikes are molded from a new kind of stronger plastic. Our
new Super Dirt Bike is better, stronger, faster, more powerful, and jumps
further </p>
<p>(Just check out this prototype video jumping over three full size cars).</p><p></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""326"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2Fa8a4hAgnkE0%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3Da8a4hAgnkE0%26feature%3Dyoutu.be&amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2Fa8a4hAgnkE0%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube"" width=""580""></iframe></div><p></p>

<strong> </strong><h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p><strong>**Please note - even though $80,000AUD is the campaign target my main goal is to raise $8,500AUD which is explained below - the grand total displayed is a dream amount &amp; all is explained below**</strong></p>
<p>Firstly I would like to say Thank You for taking the time to learn about my campaign. My name is Kerry and <strong>Try &amp; Guess</strong> is my baby. We are a gift &amp; homeware store with a difference - <strong>A Little Store With A Big Heart.</strong></p>
<p>What makes us different? </p>
<ul> <li>We support local &amp; Australian artisan, designers &amp; producers by stocking our store with totally amazing products.</li>
<li>We have room by room themes - (our shop is set up in an old weatherboard house so we thought this would be a cool idea to do). So we have a gift, homeware, kidz zone, bathroom &amp; kitchen areas.</li>
<li>We support Ethically Trading companies &amp; international indipendant artisans - if we stray off our shores to look further afield that's what we like to look for!</li> <li>But the<strong> most important</strong> part &amp; the reason why I want to have this business succeed - is that with every purchase made - we <strong>donate back to local charities &amp; organisations</strong> - currently we have 3 groups but would love to grow this number - (this equates to approximately 2% of each sale given back)</li> </ul> <p><strong>About Me</strong>: I have been involved in retail for close to 30 years now, however, this is my first solo venture. <strong>Try &amp; Guess</strong> has been operating now for just on 12 months, however, for us to complete our dream of helping our community the way we would like, we are going to need help.</p>
<p>This is where you come into the equation.</p> </div> <div> </div><h3>What We Need </h3><div><strong> </strong></div><p><strong>So what is it that we need?</strong></p><ol>
<li>First &amp; foremost, our main focus is to grow our business. We feel by opening an online shopping store we can achieve this. I believe this is an essential part of the business, as it will help us reach a wider customer demographic, whilst we help promote our amazing Australian product.  With our current Point of Sale System in our store, we have been quoted <strong>$8,500AUD</strong> to get an on-line store up &amp; running, so we can run both the bricks &amp; mortar store and the online store simultaneously while keeping track of stock levels etc in both areas. <strong>All online sales will also have the same percentage of funds donated back to local charities/organisations as the bricks &amp; mortar store.</strong>
</li>
<li>Secondly, we would like to set up our last room in the house. The way we set this room up will depend on how many funds we raise. If we don't meet our target, we will probably turn this into a small coffee/lounge area, and if we can't achieve that,  we will stock it with product. We are estimating <strong>$7,500AUD</strong> will be what we need to purchase some chairs &amp; coffee machine etc to get this set up as a coffee room. <strong>The coffee room will also be donating a percentage of every sale back to various causes.</strong>
</li>
<li>Next, if we reach our target,  we would love to be able to extend the shop and create a new store room, disable access into the store, customer toilet and demonstration/course area. One of our ideas will be to have this area to run art/cooking courses etc, <strong>with all profits from these</strong>, going back to local causes.</li>
<li>Lastly, if by some miracle we exceed our target and have funds remaining, we would love to heat &amp; cool our store. As it is in an old home, only one room is heated/cooled and we feel this will make the shopping journey a little more enjoyable throughout the remaining store for our customers. </li>
</ol><p>After all the above is done &amp; achieved, and if we have any remaining funds left over, we would put the money back into advertising &amp; product to go back into the store.</p><div> </div> <div> </div><h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Ballarat is a wonderful country town, however as with quite alot of Australia, we have a number of homeless youths, at risk women, children &amp; men, low income families, who at times need a little help and even animal shelters who need a helping hand.</p><p><strong>We are currently raising funds for the following groups, and have raised a little over $1,200 since opening, but our dream is to be able to donate that amount  each month. The groups are</strong>:</p><p><strong>Eureka Mums</strong> - A vounteer run Not For Profit Organisation - who rehome new and pre-loved baby goods and nursery equipment to families in need. These donations are distributed to families experiencing hardship in Ballarat and surrounding towns through their partnerships with maternal &amp; child health nurses and local social service agencies.</p><p><strong>Aron Siermans Fund</strong> - Aron is a local boy who's mother was murdered by a man whilst he was on parole in 2013.

**Please note - even though $80,000AUD is the campaign target my main goal is to raise $8,500AUD which is explained below - the grand total displayed is a dream amount & all is explained below**
Firstly I would like to say Thank You for taking the time to learn about my campaign. My name is Kerry and Try & Guess is my baby. We are a gift & homeware store with a difference - A Little Store With A Big Heart.
What makes us different? 
 We support local & Australian artisan, designers & producers by stocking our store with totally amazing products.
We have room by room themes - (our shop is set up in an old weatherboard house so we thought this would be a cool idea to do). So we have a gift, homeware, kidz zone, bathroom & kitchen areas.
We support Ethically Trading companies & international indipendant artisans - if we stray off our shores to look further afield that's what we like to look for! But the most important part & the reason why I want to have this business succeed - is that with every purchase made - we donate back to local charities & organisations - currently we have 3 groups but would love to grow this number - (this equates to approximately 2% of each sale given back)  About Me: I have been involved in retail for close to 30 years now, however, this is my first solo venture. Try & Guess has been operating now for just on 12 months, however, for us to complete our dream of helping our community the way we would like, we are going to need help.
This is where you come into the equation.   What We Need  So what is it that we need?
